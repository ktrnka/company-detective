      "# [What To Do If Your Bird Is Sneezing by Chewy Editorial on 2013-08-06](https://be.chewy.com/sneezing/)\nMost parrots naturally come from tropical, humid climates and when kept indoors as pets the heating and cooling to control indoor climate dries the air. Your bird? nasal passages are then dried, which, in most cases, causes sneezing.\n\nSYMPTOMS\n\nA bird may sneeze for a number of reasons other than it being in an environment that is too dry. Vitamin-A deficiency or a bacterial, fungal or viral infection can also cause sneezing and discharge from your bird? nares. A more serious problem that could cause damage to the nasal or sinus passages could be the case if audible breathing sounds, tail-bobbing, weight loss, nasal or eye discharge or a change in vocalizations or eating habits accompany the sneezing.\n\nIf a bird that is native to Central or South America is housed with or near a dusty bird, such as a cockatoo, cockatiel, African grey or Eclectus, the dander from these birds can cause sneezing in your other birds.\n\nIMMEDIATE CARE\n\nSome sneezing is normal and is likely due to a dry environment. If it becomes a chronic problem or nasal discharge accompanies the sneezing, a full vet check is necessary to determine is the problem is due to some sort of infection.\n\nLONG-TERM CARE\n\nKeep your bird in an adequately humid environment so the cilia in their nasal passages can work properly to clear debris. Provide your bird with a sufficient amount of Vitamin-A, which also helps the nasal passages work properly.\n\nIf the vet tests determine that no disease or infection is the cause for the sneezing, here are several tips for improving your bird? too-dry environment:\n\n1) Take your bird into the bathroom while you shower, enveloping it in high humidity.\n\n2) Have your avian vet show you how to periodically flush your bird? nostrils with sterile saline to remove debris or set up a regular appointment to have your vet perform the saline flushing.\n\n3) Try moving the bird into a room with a humidifier, but always keep the water clean to prevent bacteria from growing\n\n4) Place bird safe plants in your bird? room, which will add oxygen and humidity to its environment.\n\n5) Periodically mist your bird to raise humidity\n\n6) Reduce allergens by running am air filter with HEPA filtration. Run a box fan with an air conditioner filter on the back to catch dust, dander and feathers. This will increase the efficiency of the air filter, which will clean any additional allergens not caught by the fan.\n\nPosted By: Chewy Editorial\n\nFeatured Image: By Ladymoonz/Shutterstock",

      "# [7 Cat Laxatives To Relieve Cat Constipation (and How to Choose the Right One) by Katie Koschalk on 2024-01-11](https://be.chewy.com/cat-laxatives/)\nNormally, a cat’s digestive system purrs right along, smoothly and without a hitch. But sometimes things can get a bit clogged, leading to constipation.\n\nSo, how do you get things moving again? A common approach is the use of cat laxatives, which help stimulate a bowel movement.\n\nThere are seven commonly used cat laxatives, but choosing the right one—with the guidance of your veterinarian—depends on a variety of factors, including the cause of constipation; your cat’s overall health and age; and any underlying medical conditions they have.\n\nWe spoke to vet experts to get the inside scoop on constipation and cat laxatives, including how they can help your furry pal and how to choose the right one.\n\nWhat Is Cat Constipation?\n\nCat constipation is a common health issue where a cat experiences difficulty passing feces or poops less frequently than normal, says Dr. Winnie Ybarra, DVM, DACVIM, a veterinary internist at San Francisco Animal Medical Center in San Francisco.\n\nCats typically poop once per day, although some poop twice daily. Pooping less than this could be a sign of constipation.\n\nAccording to Dr. Nicole Savageau, VMD, a veterinarian with The Vets in Austin, Texas, common causes of constipation in cats include:\n\nDehydration\n\nLack of exercise\n\nStress and anxiety\n\nHairballs\n\nDietary issues and food changes\n\nInflammatory bowel disease\n\nMore serious causes can include pelvic injuries; a blockage due to a foreign body; kidney disease; megacolon (a condition where the colon becomes enlarged); neurological issues; and some types of cancer. In some cases, no underlying cause of constipation can be determined.\n\nSymptoms of Cat Constipation\n\nUnlike humans, cats can’t verbally communicate their discomfort, so it’s important for cat parents to be observant of their feline’s behavior and bodily functions. Recognizing the symptoms of constipation in cats is crucial for timely and effective treatment.\n\nBelow, Dr. Ybarra shares some common symptoms of constipation to watch for.\n\nInfrequent or no bowel movements\n\nHard, round, dry feces (as opposed to well-formed, slightly soft feces)\n\nStraining in the litter box; spending a long time in the litter box; or avoiding the litter box altogether\n\nDisplaying signs of pain or discomfort (like crying out) while trying to defecate\n\nBloody or mucus-covered stools\n\nBlood or mucus around the rectum\n\nLethargy or reduced activity\n\nPoor appetite\n\nVomiting\n\nAbdominal bloating\n\nHow to Help a Constipated Cat: Cat Laxatives\n\nWhen your cat is suffering from constipation, there are several steps you can take to help alleviate their discomfort and address the underlying issue. We’ll touch on the full gamut shortly, but first, let’s zero in on laxatives.\n\nCat laxatives are substances designed to help cats with constipation by facilitating bowel movements. They work in various ways, such as stimulating intestinal muscles or drawing water into the colon.\n\n4 Types of Cat Laxatives\n\nThe choice of laxative depends on the severity of the constipation and the cat’s overall health. There are four main types of laxatives:\n\nLubricant laxatives: Coats the stool and intestines in a lubricating film, easing the passage of feces.\n\nOsmotic laxatives: Draws water into the colon from surrounding tissues. This increased water content helps soften the stool and increases its volume, which, in turn, stimulates bowel movements.\n\nStimulant laxatives: Triggers the intestines to contract and push out the stool.\n\nBulk-forming laxatives: Provides fiber, which increases the bulk of the stool. This can stimulate a cat’s bowels.\n\n7 Common Cat Laxatives\n\nAccording to Dr. Ybarra and Dr. Savageau, common cat laxatives include:\n\nCat Lax (lubricant)\n\nMineral oil (lubricant)\n\nPolyethylene glycol 3350, aka Miralax (osmotic)\n\nLactulose (osmotic)\n\nCisapride (stimulant)\n\nMetoclopramide (stimulant)\n\nPsyllium husk, aka Metamucil (bulk-forming)\n\nWhile not technically a laxative, canned, unsweetened pumpkin can also sometimes help relieve constipation. Pumpkins have a high water and fiber content, and can hydrate the intestines and their contents. A couple of pet parent pumpkin favorites are Weruva Pureed Pumpkin and Nummy Tum-Tum Pumpkin. Note that these pumpkin foods should not replace your cat’s regular food but rather act as a supplement to relieve occasional constipation.\n\nWeruva Pumpkin Patch Up! Dog & Cat Pouches, case of 12\n\n$11.98\n\nCat Lax Cat Supplement\n\n$10.23\n\nWhich Cat Laxative Should You Use?\n\nThe right laxative for your cat depends on a variety of factors, including the cause of constipation; your cat’s overall health and age; and any underlying medical conditions, says Dr. Ybarra.\n\nIt’s crucial to only give your cat a laxative based on a veterinarian’s recommendation and with their guidance. This not only ensures the treatment’s efficacy but also your feline friend’s safety and well-being. The improper or unsupervised use of laxatives can lead to complications such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalances or worsened constipation.\n\nIn addition to selecting a suitable laxative, your vet may also discuss other aspects of care that can help manage or prevent constipation.\n\nCat Laxative vs. Stool Softener\n\nWhen addressing constipation in cats, it’s important to understand the difference between a cat laxative and a stool softener for cats, as they serve different purposes in managing the condition.\n\nCat Laxatives\n\nLaxatives are generally used when there’s a need to actively induce a bowel movement.\n\nThey produce bowel movements in one of three ways:\n\nStimulating the muscles of the intestines\n\nDrawing water into the bowel from surrounding tissues\n\nIncreasing the weight or “bulk” of the stool\n\nStool Softeners\n\nStool softeners, on the other hand, work by increasing the amount of water absorbed by the stool in the intestines, Dr. Savageau says. This process results in softer stool, which is easier for the cat to pass.\n\nStool softeners are particularly beneficial for cats who need to avoid straining during defecation, such as those with certain medical conditions or post-surgical cases.\n\nIn some cases, both laxatives and stool softeners are used.\n\nWhen to Go to the Vet\n\nIf not properly treated, constipation in cats can lead to several health risks, some of which can be life-threatening, such as:\n\nMegacolon: A condition where the colon becomes abnormally enlarged and loses its ability to function properly. This can be caused by the colon being consistently stretched more than it should be, such as when a cat has chronic constipation.\n\nObstipation: A severe form of constipation where a cat cannot pass any stool or gas, usually due to fecal matter becoming dry and hard in the intestines.\n\nToxemia: A condition that can occur when prolonged constipation leads to the accumulation and stagnation of feces in the colon. This stagnation can result in the absorption of toxins into the bloodstream.\n\nDue to these risks, it’s essential to treat constipation promptly. If constipation persists for more than 24–48 hours, bring your cat to a veterinarian. The doctor can assess your cat’s health; work to determine the underlying cause; and provide a treatment plan.\n\nCat Constipation Treatment\n\nDr. Savageau shares some common cat constipation remedies, including:\n\nIncrease water intake: Dehydration is a common cause of constipation. Ensure your cat has access to fresh, clean water at all times. Consider using a cat water fountain, such as the Drinkwell Pet Fountain or Catit Flower Fountain, as cats often prefer running water. Learn more tips to get your kitty to drink more water.\n\nDietary changes: Your vet might recommend incorporating more fiber and water into your cat’s diet through wet food, specially formulated cat food or nutritional supplements, such as psyllium husk or canned pumpkin. A higher fiber diet should be introduced gradually to avoid upsetting your cat’s stomach.\n\nLaxatives or stool softeners: Your vet might give your cat specific laxatives or stool softeners to get things moving or soften the stool.\n\nExercise: Encourage your cat to engage in regular physical activity. Play sessions can help stimulate digestion and bowel movements.\n\nReducing stress: In some cases, stress and anxiety can cause constipation. Stress can be caused by big things like adding a new pet to the house, or smaller things like construction noise outside. Soothing your cat, and reducing or removing environmental stress, if possible, could help ease constipation. Explore popular cat calming aids.\n\nUltimately, the treatment for constipation depends on its severity, adds Dr. Ybarra. “If the constipation is mild, adding water, canned food or fiber to the diet can help,” she says. If it’s more severe, enemas (performed by a vet) and medication might be needed. “Very severe cases require manual deobstipation under anesthesia,” she says.\n\nBy recognizing the symptoms of constipation, knowing when to seek veterinary assistance and understanding the treatment options available, you can ensure your cat remains comfortable and healthy.\n\nLooking for more information surrounding kitty bathroom conundrums?

      "# [28 Most Beautiful Cat Breeds in the World by Annie Butler Shirreffs on 2024-04-03](https://be.chewy.com/beautiful-cats/)\nWhat makes a cat beautiful? For some people, the cat breed’s coat color or pattern put them on the most beautiful cats list. For others, it’s the color of the eyes.\n\nFor Rick Hoskinson, an all-breed judge with The International Cat Association (TICA), a registry of purebred cats, it’s a combination of these qualities that makes a cat truly striking. “A beautifully balanced cat with stunning condition is always an attention getter,” he says. “A cat with a striking coat pattern and eye color is also beautiful.”\n\nA beautiful cat is like a beautiful work of art, says Teresa Keiger, an all-breed judge with the pedigreed cat registry Cat Fanciers’ Association (CFA). She explains that a “balanced” cat means that all body parts are in harmony with each other—where no one aspect dominates and all body parts fit together as a whole. “With some breeds, all the parts might be very different. But put them all together, and you have one lovely piece.”\n\n16 Beautiful Cats\n\nWith the help of current CFA and TICA registration lists, input from all-breed judges Keiger and Hoskinson and a couple of informal polls, we came up with the following list of beautiful cats, who (bonus!) also happen to be friendly and people-oriented.\n\nBut before we start, a word of warning: The topic of most beautiful domestic cat breeds is very subjective. Every cat enthusiast, every cat parent and every cat breed judge has their own idea of the most beautiful cats in the world. So, we hope you enjoy—and agree with—our picks.\n\nAbyssinian\n\nWe start our list with one of the oldest known cat breeds. The Abyssinian’s defining feature is a richly colored, ticked tabby coat in which each hair is ticked with four to six bands of color—dark at the tip, lighter at the roots and alternating dark and light. The original coat color is known as ruddy, but the Abyssinian also comes in different shades, including red, blue and fawn. The face features dramatic markings that don’t appear anywhere else on the body.\n\nAbyssinians are extremely graceful and elegant. They remind Keiger of male ballet dancers—“muscular, lithe and seeming to be barely standing on the Earth.”\n\nAmerican Shorthair\n\nA replication of the short-haired cats who came with settlers from Europe to North America, American Shorthairs are known as America’s shorthaired breed. “Often referred to as a ‘working cat’—which the breed originally was—the muscular body shows this,” says Keiger, who serves as editor of CFA’s Cat Talk magazine.\n\nThe short coats have a hard, dense and lustrous texture, giving the breed a natural protective appearance. They come in a variety of colors (like white, black, blue aka gray, and brown) and patterns (like calico, tortoiseshell and bi-color), but the most popular—and recognizable—color and pattern is a silver base with black tabby markings. These tabby markings create swirls all over the body, broken “necklaces” that highlight the chest, rings around the legs and an “M” mark on the forehead.\n\nBengal\n\nSeeing spots? You’re probably looking at a Bengal cat. Originally developed from crosses between domestic cats and the Asian leopard cat, Bengals are most noted for their richly colored, highly contrasted coat of vivid spots and distinctive marbling. “What I find so striking about the Bengal is the color and pattern,” Keiger says. Some have rosettes like those found on leopards, jaguars and ocelots. In fact, the Bengal is the only domestic cat with rosettes. Some Bengal coats even feature “glitter,” which gives each hair an iridescent sheen. Not only beautiful to behold, the Bengal coat is also soft and luxurious to the touch, having “a pelt-like feel that no other breed has,” Keiger says.\n\nCombine the Bengal’s distinctive coat with their wild expression, created by tabby facial markings and large oval eyes, and it’s easy to see why this breed has captivated many cat lovers.\n\nBirman\n\nKnown for a soft, silky, lush coat and soulful, deep-blue eyes, the Birman is classified as a pointed breed, which means the cat will have different, darker colors on the face, ears, feet and tail. Keiger says the Birman comes dressed for a party, as the breed also has a white spotting pattern with white “gloves” on all paws and “laces” up the back legs. She also points out their expressive eyes.\n\nKnown as “The Sacred Cat of Burma,” the Birman comes in a rainbow of colors, and the beautiful coat features a longer ruff round the neck and a fluffy tail. The pattern within their points can be solid, tabby or tortoiseshell.\n\nLike all color-point breeds, the Birman is born white, with the color developing as they mature.\n\nBritish Shorthair\n\nAnother of the oldest known breeds, everything about the British Shorthair is round—ears, tail, paws and expressive eyes in a round head with round cheeks.\n\nBest known for their gray (also known as blue) coat, the British Shorthair comes in a variety of colors. And that coat! Keiger says the British Shorthair has the densest coat of any of the CFA breeds—“one that you just want to squeeze and run your fingers through all day.”\n\nAnd here’s a fun fact: It’s believed that the British Shorthair was the inspiration for the Cheshire Cat in Lewis Carroll’s “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.”\n\nBurmese\n\nCompact and muscular, the Burmese is surprisingly heavy for their size, and that little body is covered with a silky, close-lying coat.\n\nThe Burmese’s original color is sable (a warm, rich brown), but they also come in a variety of colors, including champagne (a warm beige), blue (a medium gray) and a soft chocolate.\n\nAnd nestled in these beautiful colors is a pair of round, gold eyes that Keiger says are very expressive.\n\nDevon Rex\n\nIs it an alien? Is it an elf? Nope—it’s a Devon Rex! Known as the pixies of the cat world, the Devon Rex’s appearance is far from ordinary—a long, skinny neck, elfin face, oversized ears and large, impish eyes.\n\nPerhaps the most distinctive feature of the Devon Rex is their coat, which is velvety soft and ripples with curls. Those curls are a result of a natural mutation and appear everywhere on the body. “Even its whiskers are curled,” Keiger says.\n\nThe coat ranges from a mop of curls to a suede-like coat and comes in all colors and patterns.\n\nEuropean Burmese\n\nThe European Burmese is a cousin to the “American” Burmese above. While the Burmese has a compact, well-rounded appearance, the European Burmese is somewhat longer with gently rounded contours. The European Burmese is also slightly larger, and has a more pronounced, longer muzzle.\n\nThe biggest and most obvious difference between the two is the array of colors seen in the European Burmese—all 10 of them.\n\nThe eye shape differs between the breeds as well. Keiger says the European Burmese has sultry eyes that suck you right in. “They’re slightly hooded on the top, fully round on the bottom, and incredibly lustrous and deep in color.”\n\nPersian\n\nEasily one of the most recognizable breeds, the Persian is the quintessential “fluffy cat.” Because of that fluffy coat, these long-haired cats appear larger than they actually are. The luxurious coat is quite long and comes in a variety of colors and patterns.\n\n“The breed standard calls for a ‘sweet expression,’ so being beautiful is part of its overall being,” Keiger says. That sweet expression rests on a flat face with large, round, expressive eyes.\n\nExotic\n\nThe short-haired cousin of the Persian cat, the Exotic (also called the Exotic Shorthair) has the same round head, sweet open expression, flat profile and large, expressive eyes.\n\nThey’re bred to meet the Persian standard in every way but one. Instead of long hair, the Exotic has a thick, short coat. “You’ll revel in stroking the plush, dense coat,” Keiger says.\n\nThat short coat is unique to the Exotic, giving them a soft, rounded, teddy bear look, and it requires much less grooming than a Persian, hence the affectionate nickname “the lazy man’s Persian.”\n\nLike the Persian, the Exotic comes in a variety of colors and patterns.\n\nMaine Coon Cat\n\nKnown as “gentle giants,” Maine Coons are one of the most popular breeds in the United States. In fact, for the first time in, well, ever, the Maine Coon Cat surpassed the Bengal to become the No. 1 cat on TICA’s most recent Top 10 Breeds list.\n\nThe Maine Coon Cat is a great example of “survival of the fittest” evolution. Long-haired cats came with the settlers to the United States, and these cats naturally developed into sturdy, working cats suited to the Northeast’s harsh winters, which explains the long coat (of three distinct lengths!), a long tail they can wrap around their bodies, and their well-tufted ears and feet. Keiger says that the gorgeous, long coat comes in a wide variety of striking colors and patterns.\n\nSiamese\n\nEverything about the Siamese cat is long and sleek—long body, long head, long legs and long tail. These long, chiseled lines coupled with the angular, wedge-shaped head makes the Siamese look rather sophisticated.\n\nIn contrast to the long body, the Siamese coat is short and silky. “A good Siamese doesn’t even appear to have a coat, as it lies so close to the body,” Keiger says.\n\nThe Siamese sports a pointed coat, with seal (a dark brown) being one of the most well-known colors. But the points appear in three other colors, too: chocolate, blue and lilac. This pointed pattern accentuates the breed’s almond-shaped, blue eyes.\n\nOriental\n\nA member of the Siamese group, the Oriental has the same body type as their Siamese parent: elegant, long, lithe and slender. What makes the Oriental distinct is their wide array of colors and patterns combined with a short, sleek coat. Keiger calls the Oriental a Siamese with a different pattern—300 plus of them, in fact.\n\nThe Oriental comes in both longhair and shorthair varieties, adding the opportunity for even more breathtaking colors and patterns.\n\nRagdoll\n\nHitting No. 1 on CFA’s most recent Top 10 list, the Ragdoll is one of the largest breeds in the cat fancy. These big, laid back cats live up to their name by the way they happily get carried around by their people. They have a luxurious semi-long coat that’s silky, soft and plush, which Keiger says makes you want to just pick up the cat and cuddle them. But perhaps the first thing you might notice are their deep blue eyes that just pull you right in.\n\nThe Ragdoll cat comes in several coat colors (like chocolate, red and blue) and patterns (like colorpoint, bi-color and mitted).\n\nRussian Blue\n\nThe hallmark of this gorgeous breed is their bright, blue coat. The hairs are tipped with silver, giving the Russian Blue a glistening and shimmering look as the cat moves. The color itself is beautiful to look at, but the short, silky, dense coat is plush to the touch. You can even draw patterns in the coat with your fingers that will remain until you smooth them out again. Rounding out the Russian Blue’s beauty is their deep, emerald green eyes that, contrasted against the gray coat, are quite striking.\n\nKeiger, who has worked with the breed for more than 25 years, says the Russian Blue has a regal appearance as well. “I’ve had spectators comment that the Russian Blue ‘looks like a statue!’”\n\nScottish Fold\n\nThe first time Keiger saw a Scottish Fold, she thought the cat looked like an owl. “Its ears were folded so tightly against its round head that they were barely discernible,” she says. Those unique ears come from a natural genetic mutation, but not to worry! Their ears work just as well as any other cats’.\n\nScottish Fold kittens are born with straight ears, and at about 3 to 4 weeks of age, their ears fold—or not. Not all Scottish Folds have folded ears, but Keiger points out that those with upright ears have the same large, padded body, large, round head and expressive round eyes.\n\nThe Scottish Fold can be both short-haired and long-haired with a dense, plush coat that comes in all colors and patterns.\n\n12 Beautiful Rare Cat Breeds\n\nSome breeds (like the ones above) are a bit more mainstream and higher in popularity. But these rare breeds are sure to wow you as well.\n\nAmerican Curl\n\nUnique ears that curl back in a graceful arc give the American Curl an alert and happily surprised expression. Designed by Mother Nature herself, the ears arc gently backward and point toward the back of the skull. But the American Curl is actually born with straight ears. In three to five days, the ears start to curl back, staying in a tight rosebud position, then gradually unfurling until they permanently “set” at around 4 months of age.\n\nAlong with the striking, curved-back ears, Keiger says the American Curl is also a very graceful-appearing cat, with an elegant body, silky, flat-lying coat and expressive, walnut-shaped eyes.\n\nBombay\n\nWant a little panther in your life? Look no further than the Bombay. An example of a hybrid breed, which combines established characteristics of domestic breeds to create a specific, third look, the Bombay is a combination of black American Shorthairs and Burmese. Keiger says the Bombay resembles the Burmese, but they are larger with a somewhat longer head and slightly larger body.\n\nNicknamed “the patent-leather kid with the new-penny eyes,” the Bombay comes in one color: black. But it’s a deep, dense black with a high-gloss sheen. The coat is short and tight. Their beautiful eyes are anywhere from deep, rich gold to copper—just like a new copper penny.\n\nAdding to the breed’s beauty, Bombays sport a sweet facial expression and have a cute little sway when they walk, similar to that of an Indian black leopard.\n\nChartreux\n\nKeiger thinks of the Chartreux as a study in asymmetrical balance. “None of the body parts should go together, but they do and go together beautifully,” she says. The Chartreux is both robust and elegant, with a muscular body set upon finely boned legs and dainty feet, which makes them often described as a “potato on toothpicks.”\n\nThis natural, historic breed of France has been known for centuries for both their unique coat texture and blue color. The coat is medium-short in length and slightly wooly in texture, and the blue color can range from light ash to deep slate.\n\nThe Chartreux’s large, expressive eyes are one of their most endearing features. “The copper to orange-colored eyes just pop against the blue fur,” Keiger says.\n\nCornish Rex\n\nKeiger calls the Cornish Rex a study in curves, arches and more curves. While these cats appear fine-boned and dainty, they are actually hard-bodied and muscular, slender with a deep curve to the chest rising up to a tucked-up waist, which is why they’re often referred to as the Greyhound of the cat world.\n\nTheir head is egg-shaped and topped with tall ears, while their expressive oval eyes have a slight upward slant.\n\nBut the most unique feature of the Cornish Rex is their coat, which is noticeably curly, falling into marcel waves. Even the eyebrows and whiskers are curled. The coat, which comes in all colors and patterns, is short, close to the body and incredibly soft to the touch.\n\nEgyptian Mau\n\nThe Egyptian Mau has the distinction of being the only naturally spotted domestic cat breed (the spots are not bred in) And those spots appear everywhere across their elegant body, Keiger says. The spots can be random and of any size.\n\nA natural breed, the Egyptian Mau comes in colors that occurred naturally: silver, bronze, smoke and black (as well as dilute versions of these colors). Their body is muscular and graceful. When standing, the Egyptian Mau has a “tiptoe stance,” as their hind legs are longer than their front legs. And their mesmerizing, gooseberry-green eyes are large and alert. The way they are set gives the cat a cute, “worried” look.\n\nHavana Brown\n\nThe elegant Havana Brown comes in one color: a rich, mahogany red-brown—with matching whiskers! “The short and smooth coat shows off the Havana’s graceful lines,” Keiger says.\n\nThe Havana also has a distinctive head shape that sets this breed apart. The head is slightly longer than it is wide, narrowing to a one-of-a-kind muzzle that’s often compared to a corn cob stuck on the end of the face. Keiger says the entire head structure may remind one of the shape of a light bulb, as the muzzle is so distinctly separate.\n\nThat unique face also includes brilliant green eyes—the greener, the better!\n\nJapanese Bobtail\n\nKnown as the good luck cat of Japan, the Japanese Bobtail is an ancient breed that has been portrayed in Japanese manuscripts and paintings for at least 1,000 years. If you’ve ever seen a ceramic cat with a raised, beckoning paw in shop windows or doorways, this is the cat!\n\nThe Japanese Bobtail has elegant high cheekbones and large oval-shaped eyes, but their most unique feature is their bobbed tail that consists of a variety of angles, curves and kinks that create a pom-pom effect. Not only is the tail unique to the breed but to each individual cat. No two tails are ever the same. The hair on the tail is longer than the hair on the body, contributing to the pom-pom look.\n\nKorat\n\nAnother good luck cat, this one hailing from Thailand, the Korat is a compact, powerful cat with a single, close-lying coat that allows their rippling muscles to show. Their unique color—defined as silver-tipped blue—gives the cat a shimmering quality. The color also absorbs light, creating a halo effect. Keiger says it resembles the color of rain clouds. “With luminous, green eyes, the silver-tipped blue coat really does seem to glow all over.”\n\nWe should also mention that the Korat’s head resembles a heart shape. As Keiger says, “One can’t help but love a cat with a heart-shaped head!”\n\nNorwegian Forest Cat\n\nA relatively new and rare breed in the U.S., the Norwegian Forest Cat is a very old breed in their native Norway and has been featured in folk tales and mythology for centuries.\n\nKnown in Norway as the skogkatt (which literally means forest cat), the Norwegian Forest Cat sports a lavish coat that served as natural protection back when they lived in the forest. The lavish coat makes this already large breed look even larger. The insulated, waterproof double coat was designed to withstand Scandinavian winters and features a full frontal ruff (hair around the neck), bushy tail, rear britches and tufted paws. “They really do look as though they walked out of a fairy-tale forest,” Keiger says,\n\nOften known for their brown tabby-and-white coats, Norwegian Forest cats actually come in nearly every possible coat pattern and color combination, except pointed, chocolate and lilac.\n\nSiberian\n\nStill fairly rare in the U.S., Siberian cats are a Russian national treasure that have been documented for hundreds of years and mentioned in Russian fairy tales and children’s books.\n\nA natural breed, the Siberian’s thick, rich triple coat protected the cats from the elements in their native country. The Siberian is considered a semi-longhair, but their coats vary with the seasons—a thick full coat in the winter and shedding down to a shorter, less dense coat in the summer.\n\nThe beautiful coat comes complete with a neck ruff, fluffy britches, a bushy tail, and hairs in and on top of the ears. “Plus, they possess some of the most unusual colors and patterns of all cats,” Keiger says.\n\nSomali\n\nThe Somali is essentially a long-haired Abyssinian, the result of a recessive gene in the Abyssinian breed. Their long hair is soft and finely textured, and comes in the same colors as the Abyssinian. Their vibrantly colored coat, striking facial markings, large ears and bushy tail give the cat a captivating, little fox look. And as Keiger says, who wouldn’t want to live with a cat that resembles a fox?\n\nTurkish Angora\n\nThe rare and beautiful Turkish Angora is considered a national treasure in their native Turkey with good reason—this breed is the epitome of elegance. Lithe and finely boned, the Turkish Angora is graceful and energetic. “The triangular head with flat planes and highly set ears just complete the image of a living work of art,” Keiger says.\n\nThat elegant body is covered with a semi-long, soft silky coat that rarely mats. The head is crowned with large, erect and tufted ears, and the tail streams behind them in a long plume. Although a white coat with blue eyes is favored in Turkey and was the original color of the breed when introduced into the U.S., the breed comes in a variety of colors and patterns.\n\nBottom line? Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. These are just some of the beautiful cats out there, each with their own distinctive looks, personalities and behaviors.

      "# [Spaying Cats: Everything You Need To Know by Wendy Rose Gould on 2024-06-26](https://be.chewy.com/spaying-cats/)\nYou’ve likely heard about the importance of spaying cats. While veterinarians and experts strongly recommend this procedure, it’s only natural to have questions about the process before jumping into it.\n\nAhead, we’re covering everything you need to know about getting a cat spayed, including when you should do it, what the procedure is like, the cost, the recovery time, and spaying’s benefits.\n\nWhat Is Cat Spaying?\n\nSpay for a cat is the process of removing the female reproductive organs, explains Jessica Thompson, DVM, a veterinarian based in Portland, Oregon. Medically referred to as an ovariohysterectomy, the cat spay procedure involves surgically removing the ovaries and uterus to prevent pregnancy. Spayed female cats also no longer have heat cycles.\n\nSpaying is performed under general anesthesia so your cat isn’t awake or aware of what’s going on. It’s considered a safe, routine procedure.\n\nWhen To Spay a Cat\n\nYou can technically spay a female cat at any point in her life. However, it’s generally recommended to spay a cat before her first heat cycle, which can occur as early as 4 months of age.\n\nAbel Gonzalez, DVM, a San Luis Obispo, California-based veterinarian, says this timing significantly reduces a female cat’s risk of mammary cancer, which increases significantly after a cat's first heat cycle and each time they go into heat.\n\nBenefits of Spaying a Cat\n\nAlong with preventing pregnancy, there are other notable benefits associated with the spay procedure. Spaying a female cat:\n\nReduces her risk of developing mammary cancer\n\nPrevents a type of uterine infection called pyometra\n\nEliminates undesirable behaviors (such as yowling and escaping) during the heat cycle\n\nPrevents overpopulation\n\nIncreases their lifespan, since they are less prone to certain health issues and are at a lower risk of injury from fights and accidents\n\nHow Much Does Spaying a Cat Cost?\n\nThe cost for spaying cats typically ranges from $5o to several hundred dollars. “Factors affecting the price include geographic location, type of clinic, and the cat’s health,” Dr. Gonzalez says. He adds, “Spaying during heat can be more expensive and some veterinarians prefer to wait until the heat cycle is over.”\n\nAdditionally, if your vet offers pre-anesthetic blood work, an intravenous (IV) catheter, or fluids during the procedure, these can contribute to higher costs. You can also expect to pay for pain medication as part of the spay aftercare.\n\nSome pet insurance policies may cover the cost for cat spaying and/or some of the associated costs incurred. Dr. Gonzales recommends double checking with your provider to determine what’s covered and what’s not so you can plan ahead.\n\nYou can also seek low-cost spaying procedures by checking with local animal shelters, humane societies, and the ASPCA. Your veterinarian may offer a payment plan to help you manage costs, too.\n\nWhat Is the Cat Spay Procedure Like?\n\nOn the day your cat’s being spayed, you’ll drop her off at the vet (often in the early morning, so don’t forget your coffee).\n\nOnce it’s time for surgery, the veterinarian will administer anesthesia to bring her into a deep slumber and ensure she experiences no pain during the procedure.\n\nWhile your cat is fast asleep, the vet will make a small incision into her abdomen to carefully remove her ovaries and uterus. This usually takes around 20 to 30 minutes, but it can vary depending on the cat’s age, weight, and overall health. Afterward, the incision is tightly closed with either sutures or surgical glue.\n\nAfter your cat’s spay procedure, she’ll be monitored carefully as she wakes up from anesthesia. You should receive a call, usually in the afternoon, letting you know that you can come pick up your kitty.\n\nThe vet will provide you with aftercare instructions and likely some medications to manage pain.\n\nWhat Is the Cat Spay Procedure Like?\n\nOn the day your cat’s being spayed, you’ll drop her off at the vet (often in the early morning, so don’t forget your coffee).\n\nOnce it’s time for surgery, the veterinarian will administer anesthesia to bring her into a deep slumber and ensure she experiences no pain during the procedure.\n\nWhile your cat is fast asleep, the vet will make a small incision into her abdomen to carefully remove her ovaries and uterus.

You should receive a call, usually in the afternoon, letting you know that you can come pick up your kitty.\n\nThe vet will provide you with aftercare instructions and likely some medications to manage pain.\n\nCat Spay Aftercare and Recovery\n\nAfter the spaying procedure, cats require a period of rest and recovery that lasts between 10 to 14 days.\n\n“During the first few days, the cat will be prescribed pain medication to manage their pain and discomfort,” Dr. Thompson says. Give her medications as instructed, and make sure you provide a comfortable, quiet, and safe place for your cat to get some rest.\n\nOffer your cat small amounts of water and a small meal once she is fully awake. You can gradually return to her regular diet over the next 24 hours, following your veterinarian's instructions.\n\nMonitor your cat’s spay incision healing process and ask your vet what warning signs to look out for. A healthy, healing incision should be free of excess redness, swelling, discharge, or gaps.\n\nKeep your calendar clear, because you may need to schedule a follow-up appointment with your vet to remove stitches and check on your cat’s recovery. Some stitches are absorbable and will dissolve on their own, while others need to be removed by the veterinarian. Your vet will let you know if a follow-up appointment is necessary.\n\nWhat You Need for Your Spayed Cat\n\nMake sure you have everything you need before getting a cat spayed.\n\nElizabethan collar: “It's important to prevent the cat from licking or chewing at the incision site. An Elizabethan collar is often recommended to prevent such behavior,” says Dr. Thompson. A soft option like the SunGrow Post-Surgery Soft Cone Dog & Cat Recovery Collar may be more comfortable than rigid options.\n\nSpay suit: Alternatively, Dr. Thompson says there are spay suits available that serve the same purpose while giving your cat some additional freedom of movement. Try the Suitical Recovery Suit for Cats.\n\nComfortable bedding: Your cat will need a quiet, safe, and comfortable place to rest. If you don’t already have a designated place, consider something like the Frisco Sherpa Self-Warming High-Walled Bolster Small Cat Bed or Armarkat Cuddler Cat Bed.\n\nSunGrow Post-Surgery Soft Cone Dog & Cat Recovery Collar\n\n$12.72\n\nSuitical Recovery Suit for Cats\n\n$28.00\n\nFrisco Sherpa Self-Warming High-Walled Bolster Small Cat Bed\n\n$15.33\n\nArmarkat Cuddler Cat Bed\n\n$20.99\n\nCat Spay Side Effects\n\nFortunately, serious complications from spaying a female cat are quite rare. Like any surgical procedure, though, some risks are involved. Potential complications include reactions to anesthesia, bleeding, infection, and issues with wound healing.\n\nMonitor your cat for:\n\nExcessive bleeding\n\nSwelling\n\nRedness\n\nDischarge at the incision site\n\nSigns of pain\n\nLethargy\n\nLoss of appetite\n\nVomiting\n\nDiarrhea\n\nDifficulty urinating\n\nContact your veterinarian immediately if you notice any concerning symptoms.\n\nCat spaying is an essential responsibility for pet parents, and there is no reason to not spay your cat. Spaying ensures the health and well-being of your feline companions while also being mindful of the broader impact on animal welfare.\n\nMake sure to follow your veterinarian's instructions for post-operative care to ensure a smooth recovery for your cat—and don’t forget lots of cuddles, too!\n\nSpaying Cats FAQs\n\nQ: Where can I get my cat spayed?\n\nA:\n\nYou can get your cat spayed at most veterinary clinics. Additionally, many animal shelters and rescue organizations offer low-cost spay and neuter services. They can provide you with information about cat spaying and may even offer financial assistance.\n\nExpert input provided by Jessica Thompson, DVM, a veterinarian at Vista Pet Hospital in Portland, Oregon; Abel Gonzalez, DVM, a San Luis Obispo, California-based veterinarian.\n\nThis content was medically reviewed by Chewy veterinarians.\n\nBeWell",

But what’s the best way to care for them? We spoke with veterinary experts about every aspect of basic pet turtle care, from diet and habitat to what to do when they’re sick.\n\nTurtles and Tortoises: Overview\n\nOrder: Testudines (or Chelonia)\n\nTurtles (aquatic, semi-aquatic)\n\nFamily: Emydidae\n\nSize: 3.5-12 inches, depending on the species\n\nLifespan: 20-60+ years\n\nTortoises\n\nFamily: Testudinidae\n\nSize: 4 inches to 6 feet, depending on the species\n\nLifespan: 25-100+ years\n\nFun Turtle Facts\n\nMany pet turtles live a very long life. Some tortoises have lived to over 100 years old!\n\nTurtles have a good sense of hearing and are able to recognize their keepers.\n\nTurtles can see in color and prefer to eat colorful food items.\n\nTurtles in cold places can slow their heart and metabolism down during the winter. This decreases their need for oxygen, so they can spend the entire winter living beneath the ice of a pond.\n\nThe easiest way to tell the difference between a turtle and a tortoise is that turtles are water-dwelling creatures with webbed feet or flippers, and tortoises are land-dwelling creatures with more elephantlike feet. Most turtles are more omnivorous (feeding on both plant and animal sources), while generally all tortoises are herbivorous (eating plant sources only).\n\nTurtle and Tortoise Supply Checklist\n\nTank or enclosure\n\nUVB light\n\nBasking light\n\nBasking dock\n\nHeat lamp\n\nInfrared thermometer\n\nAquarium water heater\n\nCanister water filter\n\nSiphon\n\nTank substrate\n\nWater conditioner\n\nWater test kit\n\nTank decor\n\nTurtle food\n\nAdditional items for tortoises:\n\nHumidity control\n\nFood dish\n\nCalcium supplement\n\nMultivitamin\n\nScreened lid\n\nHabitat\n\nA turtle’s habitat requirements vary depending on their species. Price Dickson, DVM, a veterinarian specializing in birds and reptiles at My Pet’s Animal Hospital in Lakeland, Florida, provides an overall guideline for slider turtles (e.g., species like red-eared slider turtles and yellow-bellied sliders), who get their name from the way they slide into the water to escape predators. She adds that most aquatic and semi-aquatic turtles also do well with these guidelines.\n\nImportant note: Different species of turtles and tortoises have different care requirements. Research your pet's species and speak with your vet to ensure you’re providing everything they need to be healthy and happy.\n\nEnclosure\n\nSmaller turtles can be kept in an indoor aquarium tank, whereas larger turtles do well outside in a fish pond, where they can get natural sunlight, Dr. Dickson says.\n\nIt’s important that turtles have plenty of room in their tank. For smaller turtles, the ideal tank size is 10 gallons (38 liters) of water per inch of shell length. So, a 4-inch turtle would need a 40-gallon tank.\n\nHave concerns about your turtle escaping? Fortunately, this isn’t much of a risk for indoor turtles, Dr. Dickson says. “They can’t climb steep, glass siding. So, as long as the water and basking area are more than a turtle-length from the top of the tank, they are unlikely to get out,” she explains.\n\nOutdoor turtles, however, are at a great risk of escaping. To prevent the chances of this happening, make sure that the pond they’re in is fenced in. The fence should be two to three times higher than the turtle’s length and extend below the soil line, as turtles can dig.\n\nREPTI ZOO 120-gal Wooden Reptile Terrarium\n\n$399.99\n\nFREE 1-3 day shipping\n\nTemporarily out of stock\n\nTetrafauna Aquatic Turtle Deluxe Aquarium Kit\n\n$192.01\n\nFREE 1-3 day shipping\n\nAivituvin 12.4-in Indoor & Outdoor Wood Tortoise House\n\n$89.99\n\nFREE 1-3 day shipping\n\nBedding\n\nThe type of bedding or substrate you choose to get for your pet turtle will depend on how you’d like to set up their tank.\n\n“The easiest is a large stone or gravel that is too large to fit in the turtle’s mouth,” Dr. Dickson says. Size matters here, because turtles may try to swallow their bedding, which can lead to medical problems. Using stones that your turtle literally can’t ingest eliminates that risk.\n\nLight and Decor\n\nEssential decor for pet turtle tanks includes a dock and a UVB light, Dr. Dickson says.\n\nA UVB-producing light should be placed over the dock. Turtles need UVB light so their body can produce vitamin D. The light also acts as a heat source so turtles can warm up. “As cold-blooded animals, keeping warm ensures that they can digest their food and that their immune system functions,” Dr. Dickson explains.\n\nA dock allows pet turtles to haul themselves completely out of the water and dry off. They also love to have a platform for basking in their UVB light.\n\nDecor to avoid placing in your turtle’s tank includes anything that they could easily swallow, such as plastic plants with small leaves, which can be mistaken for food.\n\nZoo Med Repti Tuff Splashproof Halogen Reptile Terrarium Lamp\n\n$7.19\n\nTemporarily out of stock\n\nZoo Med Aquatic Turtle UVB & Heat Lighting Kit\n\n$56.77\n\nFREE 1-3 day shipping\n\nTemporarily out of stock\n\nPenn-Plax Floating Turtle Pier Platform\n\n$28.99\n\nHeat Lamp\n\nA heat lamp is important for pet turtles to bask and maintain their body temperature, Dr. Dickson says. The strength of the lamp depends on how far away it is from the turtle.\n\nInfrared Thermometer\n\nTo assess the actual temperature of the basking area, Dr. Dickson recommends an infrared thermometer. Once you know the temperature, you can move the heat lamp closer or get a stronger one, if needed. Most semi-aquatic turtles like basking temperatures of 85-95 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nCleaning\n\nDr. Dickson says a pet turtle tank needs a complete water change every week or two—but that alone isn’t enough. Because turtles are messy—they eat, pee and poop in their water—they also need a strong canister water filter. A water conditioner should also be used to eliminate the chlorine in the tap water.\n\nIn addition to weekly tank cleanings, the filter needs to be cleaned every two to three weeks with a turtle-safe cleaner. The substrate should also be agitated (mixed up) and cleaned using a siphon during water changes to remove waste, and the tank walls cleaned of algae, Dr. Dickson advises.\n\nDiet\n\nWhat Do Turtles Eat?\n\nMany turtle species are omnivores and benefit from a varied diet, Dr. Dickson says. “The more variety, the better!”\n\nA young turtle’s diet should consist of about half protein and half vegetables. The vegetables should be chopped up into small pieces and sprinkled into the water, Dr. Dickson says.\n\nShe encourages pet parents to feed as much as their turtle will eat in 5-10 minutes, then scoop out the rest with an aquarium net. While it may be tempting to try to feed them in their basking area, Dr. Dickson says they must be fed in water, as they won’t eat anywhere else.\n\nThis can make giving powder supplements tricky. The good news is that most pet turtles won’t need supplements if you offer a balanced turtle pellet alongside their regular food every other day. Tortoises, on the other hand, typically need calcium and sometimes multivitamins as well. Talk to your veterinarian if you think your turtle needs additional nutrients, or if you’re concerned about their diet or how much they’re eating.\n\nSources of animal protein for turtles can include:\n\nWorms\n\nCrickets\n\nShrimp\n\nSnails\n\nOptional: Live fish (Dr. Dickson says not every turtle will want to make the effort to catch them.)\n\nAs for vegetables, nearly all leafy greens are safe, Dr. Dickson says. These can include:\n\nMustard greens\n\nDandelion greens\n\nCollard greens\n\nCarrot tops\n\nRomaine lettuce\n\nHow Often To Feed Your Turtle\n\nWhat you feed your turtle and how often will vary depending on their life stage.\n\nBaby turtles: Feed daily, and clean away any uneaten food after 5-10 minutes to maintain the cleanliness of their tank.\n\nAdult turtles: Feed every 2-3 days to prevent unwanted weight gain.\n\nDr. Dickson recommends feeding multiple brands of turtle pellets rotated weekly, as research is still ongoing as to the perfect nutrient requirements and each brand has a different blend.\n\nZoo Med Natural Aquatic Maintenance Formula Turtle Food\n\n$14.79\n\nFluker's Buffet Blend Aquatic Turtle Food\n\n$5.31\n\nWater Requirements\n\nTurtles don’t need a separate drinking source due to living in water, which should be kept clean and filtered, Dr. Dickson says.\n\nUnlike some reptiles, turtles have a bladder and urinate. Because of this, nitrogen from their urine can build up in their water. When doing a water change, it’s important to test the water quality to keep your turtle’s tank in a healthy condition. (More on that below.)\n\n“Testing the water quality makes sure that harmful waste products aren’t building up in the water,” Dr. Dickson says. “This also makes sure that the water filter is operating appropriately, as turtles are very messy and dirty their water quickly.”\n\nFollow the instructions on your water test kit, and ask your veterinarian if you have any questions about your results.\n\nHarmful Foods for Turtles\n\nAlthough turtles can enjoy a variety of vegetables, fruits, live food and plants, there are some foods they should never eat.\n\nExamples of common foods that are bad for turtles include:\n\nAvocados (leaves and seeds)\n\nGarlic\n\nOnions\n\nToxic insects, such as fireflies\n\nDr. Dickson advises against feeding your turtle any wild-caught insects, as they can contain pesticides or toxic plant material.\n\nHandling\n\nWhen handling turtles, it’s always best to pick them up slowly with both hands and hold them firmly from the sides between their front and back legs, says Doug Mader, MSc, DVM, a triple board-certified veterinary specialist and author of “The Vet at Noah’s Ark.”\n\nHe encourages turtle keepers to be careful when handling their pet, as some turtles have sharp claws and may accidentally scratch if they struggle. Additionally, they may bite if fingers are near their mouth or head.\n\nHe also points out that it’s important to never turn your turtle upside down when handling them unless it’s absolutely necessary. Being turned upside down is stressful for turtles and can damage their internal organs.\n\n“Once a turtle gets to know the pet parent, they will not struggle to get away and will remain calm during handling,” Dr. Mader says. He adds that a turtle’s shell is very sensitive, and they actually relish being petted and scratched. (Try using a soft brush on their shell!)\n\nA major concern with turtles is that they can carry salmonella, a type of bacteria that can pose a significant risk of infection and illness when transmitted to humans. Dr. Mader says proper handling of turtles and appropriate hygiene practices like handwashing can be effective in preventing the spread of salmonella.\n\nStill, Dr. Mader says turtles shouldn’t be given to very young children and others who may have chronic health issues. Consult your family physician to learn if a pet turtle is safe for your child.\n\nHealth\n\nSigns of a Healthy Pet Turtle\n\nKnowing the signs of a healthy turtle is essential to being able to tell how your scaly pal is feeling.\n\nSigns of a healthy turtle, according to Dr. Mader, include:\n\nClear eyes with a sparkle\n\nA pink oral cavity\n\nA clean nose\n\nHealthy-looking skin\n\nA clean, hard shell\n\nClean, sharp toenails\n\nHealthy feces (whitish, chalky urate and a dark brown, pasty fecal pellet for turtles; firm, brown feces for tortoises)\n\nA body weight within their species’ normal range (according to your veterinarian)\n\nActive\n\nWalks upright lifting their body off the ground with nice, high steps (i.e., not dragging themselves along the ground)\n\nCommon Health Problems in Pet Turtles\n\nCommon health problems in pet turtles include:\n\nSevere nutritional diseases due to an unbalanced diet\n\nSwollen eyes from a lack of sufficient vitamin A\n\nSoft shells from a lack of vitamin D and calcium\n\nInternal parasites and systemic illness due to dirty, unsanitary living conditions and poor water quality\n\nWhen To See Your Vet\n\nTurtles “are masters at hiding signs of illness,” Dr. Mader says, “and when they get sick, it usually progresses slowly over a long period.”\n\nSigns of an ill turtle can include:\n\nNasal discharge\n\nSwollen, puffy eyes\n\nEyes constantly being shut\n\nBubbles from the nose\n\nOpen-mouth breathing\n\nSwollen ears\n\nLethargy\n\nDecrease in or loss of appetite\n\nNot walking upright\n\nDiarrhea\n\nA soft shell\n\nFloating unevenly in the water\n\nDr. Mader recommends that pet turtles get yearly checkups for regular physical examinations. This will consist of monitoring your turtle’s weight, fecal testing for parasites and, if needed, blood work or other laboratory testing.\n\nThe best way to find a turtle vet is to visit the Association of Reptile and Amphibian Veterinarians website, select the “Find a Vet” tab (under For Owners) and choose from a list of reptile vets near you.\n\nFAQs About Pet Turtles\n\nQ:\n\nDo turtles make good pets?\n\nA:Yes! Dr. Dickson says turtles can be great pets who come to know their keepers and are fun to watch. Turtle keepers should be mindful that all their pet turtle’s needs are taken care of, that they have enough space and that they can live to 60 years—and maybe even longer.\n\nQ:\n\nHow long can pet turtles live?\n\nA:Depending on the species, pet turtles can live 20-60 years. Tortoises live even longer, with some species living 100 years or more!\n\nQ:\n\nAre turtles or tortoises better pets?\n\nA:It depends. Turtles make better pets for people with limited outdoor space. Tortoises benefit from living outdoors once they’re large enough to do so safely and the temperatures are appropriate.\n\nIt’s vital to research the kind of care an exotic pet like a turtle needs to thrive. Because there are multiple species of turtles to choose from, consider which best fits your preferences and is most compatible with your lifestyle, no matter whether it’s a terrestrial (land), semi-aquatic or aquatic pet turtle.\n\nNeed a name for your new pet?

      "# [Your Horse’s Teeth: Everything You Need to Know by Lucile Vigouroux, MSc, Lucile Vigouroux on 2024-05-22](https://be.chewy.com/horse-teeth/)\nYou can learn a lot about your horse from their teeth: their approximate age; the potential reason for their weight loss; and whether they have the incisor-damaging habit of cribbing, to name a few. In this article, we’ll teach you all about your horse’s teeth and help you recognize dental problems so you’re ready to spring into action when your four-legged partner shows the first sign of tooth pain.\n\nHow Many Teeth Do Horses Have?\n\nHow many teeth horses have depends on what kind of teeth you’re talking about. Just like humans, horses grow and shed a full set of deciduous teeth, aka baby teeth or “milk teeth,” before their permanent (adult) teeth come in. Each has a different quantity:\n\nDeciduous teeth: 24\n\nAdult teeth: 36 to 44\n\nThe first deciduous incisors can either erupt in utero—before the foal is born—or appear within the first weeks of life. The rest of the foal’s 24 baby teeth—12 incisors and 12 premolars—come in over the first nine months of life. They start shedding and being replaced by permanent adult teeth at about 2½ years old, a process that takes about two-and-a-half years itself.\n\nMost horses have their full set of adult teeth by age 5. A gelding (castrated male horse) or stallion (intact male horse) normally has 40-44 permanent teeth. A mare’s dentition ranges from 36 to 40 teeth.\n\nWhat’s the four-tooth difference? Mares are less likely than their male counterparts to develop canine teeth. “The maximum number of teeth an adult horse can have is 44 if they develop all four canines plus two wolf teeth,” says Dr. Jessica Martin, DVM, cIVCA, associate veterinarian at Mountain Pointe Equine Veterinary Services in Long Valley, New Jersey. (We dig into the different types of horse teeth below.)\n\nTypes of Horse Teeth\n\nAdult horses can have five types of teeth: incisors, canines, wolf teeth, premolars and molars.\n\nIncisors: Twelve incisors line the front of a horse’s mouth—six on the upper jaw and six on the lower jaw. These long, smooth, flat-surfaced teeth rip grass out of the ground or hay out of the hay net.\n\nCanines: Also called fighting teeth, the sharp, fin-shaped canines are mainly used for fighting off rivals and predators.\n\nWolf teeth: These are vestigial (remnants of) first premolars that have no function, Dr. Martin says. “There is often a concern for potential interference with the bit, therefore ridden horses’ wolf teeth are frequently extracted early in life.”\n\nPremolars: Horses have three premolars in each of the four quadrants of their mouth, totaling 12 premolars.\n\nMolars: Just like premolars, horses have three molars in each quadrant—12 in total. They are located at the very back of the mouth. With their wide rugged surfaces, both molars and premolars—also called cheek teeth—are used to crush and grind down food.\n\nHorses are high-crowned hypsodonts, which means their teeth continuously grow from their gums to replace the tooth surface lost during repetitive chewing—something they do a lot of as a grazing animal. Hypsodonty is Mother Nature’s adaptation to keeping up with teeth that get worn down from grinding down coarse plants and grasses.\n\nDid You Know? The part of your horse’s tooth that’s hidden underneath the gingival line (gums) is called the reserve crown.\n\nHow Horses Use Their Teeth\n\nThe main job of teeth, of course, is to intake and chew food before it is swallowed. But that’s not all! Here are four practical ways horses use their teeth:\n\nEating: This one’s a no-brainer. As described above, different teeth in the horse’s mouth have different roles related to picking up and grinding food to prepare it for digestion.\n\nGrooming: Horses are social animals who bond through mutual grooming. They will use their incisors (sometimes rather forcefully!) across their herd mates’ coats and manes to groom and scratch them.\n\nManipulating objects: Some horses have a reputation for being escape artists. With patience, observation and a touch of dexterity, horses and ponies can learn to use their mouths to open their stall doors and free themselves. With the help of both their lips and teeth, they can also manage to break into feed bins and other containers.\n\nCommunication and defense: Canines and wolf teeth aside, horses’ teeth aren’t sharp and pointy like those of a predator—but horses can still effectively use their teeth to communicate aggression and defend themselves. If you’ve ever been bitten by a horse, you know it hurts!\n\nCan You Tell a Horse’s Age By Their Teeth?\n\nThe short answer is yes. It’s possible to estimate a horse’s age by the appearance of their teeth. In fact, if you’ve got a horse without much information on their identity or history, peeking into their mouth is considered to be the most reliable way to guess their age bracket.\n\nAging affects your horse’s mouth in more ways than one, enabling you to pinpoint their age relatively precisely. Here are a few facts about horse teeth that help experts determine their age:\n\nDeciduous (baby) look different from permanent (adult) teeth. The deciduous teeth are wider than they are tall and have shallow roots. They sit upright in the gumline with little slope.\n\nCanine teeth appear in (usually male) horses during their fourth year of life.\n\nYoung horses typically have a cup, aka a dent with a dark center, in the middle of their incisors’ grinding surfaces. The cups disappear progressively as the animal ages from 6 to 8-11 years old.\n\nThe shape of the permanent teeth changes over time. A horse under 9 years of age will have a rectangular grinding surface; a horse from 9 to mid-teens will have a more round surface; and the grinding surface of horses older than mid-teens will look triangular.\n\nThe angulation (slope) of the incisors increases with age. A young horse will have relatively upright teeth, while a senior one will have teeth that slope forward.\n\nGalvayne’s groove is a slight indent that appears near the gumline of the four corner incisors. If you can see any of Galvayne’s groove, it means the horse may be at least a decade old but younger than 30. This groove is barely visible in a 10-year-old. At 15 years, it extends halfway down the tooth; at 20 years, it spans the length of the entire tooth. At 25 years, the upper half of the groove is gone and visible only in the bottom half, and at 30 years, the groove is completely gone.\n\nCommon Horse Dental Problems\n\nJust like people, horses can suffer from painful fractured teeth and stubborn dental infections. They can also have species-specific dental diseases. We’ve asked our experts to describe the most common equine dental problems:\n\nFractured or Infected Tooth\n\n“When I find a fractured or infected tooth, I want to know what parts of the tooth are involved, the severity of the disease, and how this affects the horse's ability to bite off and masticate food,” says Dr. Megan Hays, VMD, an associate equine veterinarian who practices dentistry at B.W. Furlong & Associates based in Oldwick, New Jersey.\n\n“To learn more about the health of the tooth roots, periodontal ligament—which attaches the teeth to the jaws—and surrounding bone and sinuses within the skull, veterinarians can use radiography (X-rays) or computed tomography (CT),” Dr. Hays says. Fractured teeth often need to be extracted.\n\n‘Expired’ or Missing Tooth\n\nHorses’ teeth are worn down throughout their lives and replaced by the reserve tooth supply in the gums. The problem is that the supply lasts throughout the tooth’s life, not the horse’s. And nowadays, with improvements in veterinary medicine and general horse care, our equine companions are often outliving their teeth.\n\nHorses continue to be born with a tooth supply designed for a 15- to 20-year life span rather than the 25- to 30-year lives that have become common. Beyond 15 years, age really takes a toll on your horse’s dentition, and they may very well run out of teeth. An expired tooth is one that has been worn down and lost its usefulness.\n\nHooks and Ramps\n\nWhen a tooth expires, its absence creates an empty space along the gums, and the opposing tooth has nothing to stop it from growing into that space. This is how a hook (sharp tooth point) or ramp (overgrown cheek tooth) can develop.\n\nThese types of imbalances are called malocclusions. “It’s important to correct imbalances during routine dentistry to prevent restrictions in the chewing motion, oral pain and premature dental wearing,” Dr. Martin says. “Imbalances can also lead to feed being retained in the mouth, periodontal disease (gum disease), and even fractured teeth.” Hooks and ramps are addressed during dental floats by carefully and strategically floating down (aka filing) the affected teeth with a rasp.\n\nEquine Odontoclastic Tooth Resorption and Hypercementosis (EOTRH)\n\nEquine odontoclastic tooth resorption and hypercementosis is common in horses older than 15 years, and can affect the incisors and canine teeth. EOTRH is a progressive disease in which the bone and tissue surrounding the roots of a horse’s incisors are reabsorbed into the body. Not only is this painful and debilitating for the animal, but it also causes the teeth to become unstable, brittle and prone to fractures.\n\nAs prey animals who need to cover up pain and weakness to survive in the wild, horses tend to be quite stoic when it comes to dental pain. “Often, by the time visible signs of EOTRH appear, X-rays reveal advanced disease,” says Dr. Hays. “Early signs could include your horse no longer wanting to bite into an apple or a carrot, as these hard treats cause tooth pain.” Another sign: They may prefer hay that is easy to pick up off the ground versus hay they have to pull out from a hay net.\n\nFor these horses, Dr. Hays recommends working with your veterinarian to create a pain and feeding management plan adapted to their limitations. You want them to eat without their teeth hurting.\n\n“Currently, the only treatment option for EOTRH is extracting the affected incisors and canines,” Dr. Hays says. Luckily, most toothless horses do really well with an adapted diet. Examples of appropriate feeds for “gummy” horses include soaked hay cubes and hay pellets, soaked beet pulp and soaked grain. Keep in mind that EOTRH-affected horses get to keep their premolars and molars, which do most of the grinding work in mastication.\n\nInterestingly, research suggests a link between EOTRH and the most common endocrine disorder of geriatric horses, Pituitary Pars Intermedia Dysfunction (PPID or Cushing's Disease). If your horse is showing signs of either condition, contact your veterinarian to schedule an examination.\n\nSigns of Dental Problems in Horses\n\nSigns of toothache in your horse can be subtle. Here’s what to look for:\n\nQuidding: A term for horses who can’t chew properly, and drop small balls of hay or grass when eating.\n\nDropping grain: A horse who struggles to chew concentrates will drop mouthfuls of their ration while trying to eat.\n\nRefusing the bit/headshaking: When the bit puts pressure on tender teeth, the horse may shake their head or refuse to take it into their mouth altogether.\n\nA head tilt: This is another way for a horse to avoid using their sore teeth to eat or carry the bit.\n\nLosing weight: If a horse can’t properly chew and swallow feed, his calorie intake will drop. If this isn’t remedied quickly, they could lose a significant amount of weight.\n\nNasal discharge and bad breath: Both are indicators of a potential tooth infection.\n\nRoutine Horse Dental Care\n\nWhat exactly does a horse dental checkup look like? “Your equine veterinarian should perform a dental examination at a regular interval determined by the horse’s age; individual characteristics of their bite pattern; and the presence or absence of dental pathology,” says Dr. Martin.\n\nA typical exam includes:\n\nSedation to relax the horse\n\nPlacement of a speculum to open the mouth\n\nA bright light and mirror to examine the surface of every tooth\n\nDental exams are recommended at least once per year for adult horses with no dental abnormalities. This frequency may differ depending on your horse’s individual needs.\n\n“When chewing, the horse’s jaw moves in a figure-eight pattern, which differs from a human chewing pattern,” Dr. Martin says. “This motion naturally forms sharp edges, or sharp points, on the enamel surfaces of the premolars and molars. These require correction on a regular basis to maintain the horse’s comfort.” Dental floating is the term for filing the teeth to remove those sharp points.\n\nHorses who have an abnormal bite pattern or dental pathology may have other imbalances that arise and require correction. This process is called dental equilibration.\n\nFAQs about Horse Teeth\n\nTaking good care of your horse’s pearly whites throughout their life can help them stay in good weight, healthy and pain-free. Keep up with regular dental care, and monitor for signs of dental pain. Ensuring your horse can chew their food properly also reduces their chances of developing health problems such as choke and colic.\n\nExpert input provided by Dr. Jessica Martin, DVM, cIVCA, is an associate veterinarian at Mountain Pointe Equine Veterinary Services based in Long Valley, New Jersey; and Dr. Megan Hays, VMD, CVA, is an associate veterinarian at B.W.

      "# [The 200 Best Horse Names by Monica Weymouth on 2021-09-30](https://be.chewy.com/horse-names/)\nWhat’s in a name? When it comes to horse names, plenty!\n\nIn the United States, racehorses must be registered with The Jockey Club, which has extremely strict naming requirements. For example, your show name must be completely original, having never been used by another registered horse. Racehorse names also can’t be more than 18 characters long, use only initials, or contain the name of a famous person or trademarked brand without their approval. These restrictions lead to those memorable Kentucky Derby names, such as Carpe Diem, Oscar Nominated and Imawildandcrazyguy, to name a few.\n\nWhen it comes to pet horses, however, you’re free to pick any name you’d like.

      "# [Cat Neutering: Everything You Need To Know by Annie Butler Shirreffs on 2024-06-25](https://be.chewy.com/cat-neutering/)\nTo snip or not to snip? That is the question. And the answer? Absolutely! First, cat neutering prevents overpopulation from unwanted litters. There are millions of stray cats in the United States, many of whom live on the streets their entire lives or add to already overburdened shelters and rescues. Second, neutering can help your kitten—or cat— be happier and healthier, while also reducing unwanted behaviors.\n\nDefine Cat Neutering\n\nTechnically speaking, neutering means surgically preventing cats from reproducing. Castration (also known as orchiectomy) is the surgical removal of a male cat’s testicles, making him unable to reproduce and also eliminating the main source of his reproductive hormones. Female cats undergo spay surgery (also called ovariohysterectomy), which is the removal of the ovaries, fallopian tubes and uterus, also eliminating the main source of hormones that drive the female’s heat cycle.\n\nA note on terminology: Over time, the terms have morphed so that we use neuter for males and spay for females, which is what we’ll do for the purpose of this article.\n\nHow Old Do Cats Need To Be To Get Neutered?\n\nThe American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), American Association of Feline Practitioners (AAFP) and many cat advocacy groups recommend neutering by 5 months of age. However, some veterinarians say 4 months is fine.\n\nArnold Plotnick, DVM, former owner of Manhattan Cat Specialists, a feline-exclusive veterinary hospital in New York City, points out that shelters like to neuter early so the cats can be adopted out while they’re still young, as shelters neuter and spay kittens before they are adopted out to decrease cat overpopulation. The standard rule for shelter cats is that the cat has to be at least 8 weeks old and weigh at least 2 pounds. Basically, the kitten needs to be big enough to get through the surgery safely. The AAFP supports early neutering (before cats are sexually mature) as a safe and effective method of decreasing cat overpopulation.\n\nIs it ever too late to neuter? Not really. As long as the cat is healthy, it shouldn’t be a problem. Having said that, Dr. Plotnick says it would be pretty unusual for a middle-aged or elderly cat to show up to a veterinary hospital still intact.\n\nWhen To Neuter Male Cats\n\nIf your kitten or cat hasn’t already been neutered by the shelter, rescue or cat breeder you got him from, get him neutered at least by the time he starts to show signs of sexual maturity. This starts early in the feline world—usually 6 to 10 months, but can be as early as 4 months. Here’s how you’ll know your male cat is showing signs of sexual maturity:\n\nSeeing testicles. A male cat’s testicles usually become visibly noticeable at around 2 months of age.\n\nStrong urine smell. The urine of unneutered male cats becomes more potent with a very unpleasant smell.\n\nYowling. When looking or calling out for a potential mate, intact males make a distinct—and loud—yowling noise.\n\nIntact males become extremely territorial of their environment and become more aggressive trying to protect it.\n\nAlong with the newly powerful urine smell, intact males spray their urine in an attempt to mark their territory, even in your house.\n\nRoaming and wandering. Even indoor-only cats desperately try to get outdoors to find a potential mate.\n\nUnless you’re planning to breed your male cat, there are really no good reasons not to get him neutered, Dr. Plotnick says. There are circumstances that might make cat parents nervous about neuter surgery (like anesthesia risks or health issues), and you should discuss these concerns with your veterinarian.\n\nBenefits of Neutering\n\nBesides curbing overpopulation, cat neutering benefits your cat in a variety of ways, including:\n\nHealth benefits like protection against certain cancers including testicular cancer or enlarged prostate glands\n\nDecreases aggressive behaviors\n\nReduces roaming, which can lead to injuries from being hit by a car or fights with other cats (which, in turn, increases the risk of contracting diseases like FeLV, FIV or cat bite abscesses)\n\nEliminates spraying and marking of territory\n\nWhere To Get a Cat Neutered\n\nIf you’ve adopted your cat from a shelter or rescue organization, chances are he’s already been neutered, which is often part of the adoption fee. If your cat hasn’t been neutered and you already have a veterinarian, they’re your best bet for neuter surgery.\n\nBut there are other options, too, especially if you’ve found a stray kitten or care for community cats. Some communities or local shelters offer free or low-cost neuter services. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) offers information about low-cost spay and neuter programs on its website. A quick internet search for information in your area will also steer you in the right direction.\n\nCat Neutering Surgery\n\nThe thought of your cat having surgery can be daunting, but the neuter procedure is not complicated and is relatively fast. Dr. Plotnick gives us the rundown:\n\nCat parents are instructed to withhold their cat’s food and water the night before as well as the morning of the surgery.\n\nMost veterinarians run some basic blood and urine tests to make sure the cat has no health issues that might rule out (or postpone) surgery. If the tests reveal no health problems, the cat is placed under anesthesia.\n\nThe cat’s scrotum is shaved to remove the hair, then is surgically scrubbed.\n\nNext, the veterinarian makes an incision into one side of the scrotum and removes the testicle, then makes a similar incision on the other side and removes the remaining testicle.\n\nBecause the scrotal incisions heal quickly, they are not sutured closed—so no sutures or even bandages.\n\nDr. Plotnick adds that neuters are much less complicated than spays, and the surgical procedure is relatively fast. An experienced veterinarian can neuter a cat in under five minutes. Because the cat is under anesthesia for a very short period of time, recovery from it is usually quick and smooth.\n\nHow Much Does It Cost To Neuter a Cat\n\nPrices vary depending on where you live, but in general you can expect to pay anywhere from $60 to $300. You might also be charged a little extra for any pain medications or if your cat requires a recovery cone (more on those below). (The more complicated spay surgery will cost at least $20 or more than neutering by comparison, since it is an internal surgery that requires pre-surgery blood work and anesthesia.)\n\nHaving the surgery done at a low-cost clinic can range from about $25 to $75, but these might not include “extras” like pre-anesthesia blood work or intravenous fluids.\n\nIf you use pet insurance, double-check to make sure neuter surgery is covered. Some plans cover it as an add-on to a standard policy or part of a wellness plan.\n\nCat Care After Neutering\n\nIn theory, you should try to limit your cat’s activity for five to seven days after the surgery, Dr. Plotnick says. But he admits that cats recover so fast from neutering that trying to enforce “bed rest” is nearly impossible. If your cat goes outdoors, keep him inside for at least a week after surgery.\n\nElizabethan collars are a good option to keep your cat from licking at the incision, assuming he will tolerate it, of course. Dr. Plotnick says that, in his opinion, wearing a collar for seven days would be ideal, but some kittens are just too wild and playful for a collar. In those cases, he shoots for two days with the collar. Some vets don’t even recommend a collar unless the cat is seen excessively licking at the incision site.\n\nBecause recovery time from neuter surgery is pretty short, the only medication that might be needed is a little pain medication for the first few days after surgery, Dr. Plotnick says.\n\nAll Four Paws Comfy Cone E-Collar for Dogs & Cats, Tan, X-Small\n\n$17.54\n\nSunGrow Post-Surgery Soft Cone Dog & Cat Recovery Collar, Pink, Small\n\n$12.72\n\nSuitical Recovery Suit for Cats, Black Camo, XX-Small\n\n$28.00\n\nMale Cats Before and After Neutering: What To Expect\n\nIf your male cat gets neutered as a kitten, you might not notice a big change in him, as he probably didn’t have a chance to exhibit signs of sexual maturity. However, if your cat is older before his neuter procedure and he’s showing signs of sexual maturity, you might notice the following changes physically and in your cat’s behavior.\n\nBehavior Changes\n\nBecause most of the unwanted male behaviors are sexual in nature, you’ll notice these behaviors after neutering.\n\nLess roaming, as he’s no longer searching for a female cat to mate with\n\nLess aggression toward other cats, as he doesn’t have to fight off other males for a female’s attention\n\nLess spraying, as he no longer “needs” to mark his territory\n\nPhysical Changes\n\nMore normal urine odor (the urine of an intact male cat is particularly strong and pungent)\n\nIt’s a misconception that male cats become fat and lazy after being neutered. Dr. Plotnick points out that while cats do slow down metabolically after neutering, you can prevent your cat from weight gain by providing an appropriate diet and exercise routine.\n\nNeutering FAQs\n\nQ:What is the difference between cat spaying and cat neutering?\n\nA:Spaying is the surgical removal of a female cat’s reproductive organs (ovaries, fallopian tubes and uterus), while neutering (also called castration) is the surgical removal of a male cat’s testicles.\n\nQ:Can a neutered cat still mate?\n\nA:No. Because a neutered cat cannot produce sperm, he cannot mate. Neutering decreases testosterone levels, so the majority of neutered cats stop showing typical male behaviors like spraying, fighting and sexual behavior, Dr. Plotnick says. That being said, a small number of neutered, male cats might retain some instinctive male behaviors and may interact with other cats in the household in ways that appear sexually aggressive. These cats aren’t actually trying to mate but use this behavior as a way of asserting dominance over the other cat(s) in the household.\n\nQ:What is the best age to neuter a cat?\n\nA:A popular saying in the cat world is Fix by Five—meaning cats should be sterilized at around 5 months of age. There are various factors, of course, like health and weight that affect this, but for the most part 5 months is the perfect age. Cats need to be at least 8 weeks old and weigh at least 2 pounds. Essentially, the cat needs to be big and healthy enough to get through the procedure safely.\n\nQ:How long is recovery from cat neutering?\n\nA:As far as anesthesia, it usually takes a few hours for the cat to wake up and 12 to 24 hours for it to leave his system completely. Post-surgery, it typically takes about five to seven days for your cat to completely recover. Mild side effects like lethargy and loss of appetite are normal. Try to keep running and jumping to a minimum (good luck!), and keep an eye on the incision site and any worsening symptoms.\n\nQ:Is it painful for cats to be neutered?\n\nA:Dr. Plotnick says there’s always some degree of pain when surgery is involved but notes that neutering is one of the less painful surgeries. Kittens, especially, behave as if nothing was ever done to them, even just a few hours after surgery. But still, Dr. Plotnick says that most veterinarians should (and do) prescribe some pain medication for the first few days after surgery.\n\nTalk to Your Veterinarian\n\nAfter Cat Neutering\n\nThere’s really no reason not to neuter, and the benefits far outweigh the cost and potential risks. Your cat will be happy and healthier, you won’t be contributing to cat overpopulation and you won’t have to deal with those disruptive male behaviors. Not all behaviors are disruptive, though.

      "# [Pet Ferrets 101: A Beginner’s Guide To Keeping a Ferret as a Pet by Wendy Rose Gould on 2024-06-28](https://be.chewy.com/pet-ferret/)\nWelcoming a pet ferret into your home is a rewarding experience filled with adventure and memory making. If you’re new to ferret ownership, there’s definitely a learning curve as you discover everything there is to know about helping them live a long and happy life. From behavior and dietary needs to setting up a safe living space and maintaining their health, we’re walking you through all the essential details.\n\nFerrets: An Overview\n\nScientific name: Mustela putorius furo\n\nSize: The average size of male ferrets is 1.5 feet and 2.5-5 pounds. For female ferrets, the average size is 1.2 feet with a weight of 1-3 pounds.\n\nLife expectancy: Domesticated ferrets have an average lifespan of 4-10 years. Wild black-footed ferrets rarely live beyond 3 years of age.\n\nFun Facts About Ferrets\n\nThe name ferret is derived from the Latin word furittus, which translates to “little thief.”\n\nFerrets have a naturally musky odor from their anal glands and sebaceous glands in their skin.\n\nThey were domesticated about 2,500 years ago and are descendants of the European polecat.\n\nA female ferret is referred to as a jill or sprite (if she’s spayed) while a male ferret is referred to as a hob or gib (if neutered). Baby ferrets are called kits.\n\nFerrets aren’t legal to own in every state or city. (e.g., California, Hawaii and New York City ban them.) Many states and cities require annual licensing fees.\n\nFind more fun facts about ferrets here.\n\nHabitat\n\nBefore bringing a ferret home, you’ll need to make sure you have everything on hand to build them a proper, safe habitat. Teresa Manucy, DVM, a veterinarian based in Jacksonville, Florida, and pet health representative for Chewy, says a ferret habitat has some unique traits. Let’s dive in.\n\nEnclosure\n\nFerrets require a wire/metal, open-air enclosure that allows for good airflow. This gives them ample ability to breathe, and it also prevents them from living in an environment of trapped odors. For a single ferret, the cage should be at least 3 feet wide by 3 feet deep by 2 feet high. Depending on the size of your ferret, a larger cage can be used.\n\n“There should be narrowed slats between the wires because they tend to squeeze between openings quite readily,” Dr. Manucy says. “The enclosure should also have a latch that they can’t pop open.” A great example is the Yaheetech Small Pet Cage.\n\nFrisco Small Animal Cage\n\n$289.99\n\nFREE 1-3 day shipping\n\nFrisco Wire Small Pet House Shaped Cage\n\n$129.35\n\nFREE 1-3 day shipping\n\nFlooring/Bedding\n\nWhile there are lots of options, Dr. Manucy says the best flooring (bedding) material for your pet ferret is a flexible, solid material that’s easy to clean. Linoleum or astroturf are her preferred options. She notes that shredded newspaper isn’t great since it can stain their little feet, and that wood chips are difficult to disinfect and tend to absorb odors.\n\nLitter Box\n\nSpeaking of odors, ferrets can be litter box trained. Dr. Manucy recommends incorporating several boxes into their cage, as well as one in their designated play area outside of the cage.\n\n“They have a very short digestive tract, so it only takes three to four hours for the food to be digested, and then they might have a very short holding time before they have to drop cargo,” Dr. Manucy says. “When they need to go, they need to go.”\n\nLitter boxes should be filled with a pelleted litter (do not use cat litter) and scooped daily. Thoroughly clean and disinfect the litter box weekly to maintain cleanliness, and prevent the spread of bacteria and parasites. Be sure to keep litter boxes away from your ferret’s feeding and sleeping areas.\n\nMarshall Ferret Litter Pan\n\n$14.99\n\nFrisco High Sided Small Pet Litter Box\n\n$13.49\n\nFood and Water Bowls\n\nSimple ceramic or stainless steel bowls are great for your ferret’s water and food needs. Water bottles can also be used to ease access and cleaning. We’ll discuss specific ferret diets below.\n\nFood bowls, water dishes and litter boxes all need to be secured so your ferret does not flip them over.\n\nWare Sifter Small Animal Feeder\n\n$19.99\n\nLiving World Lock & Crock Dish Small Animal Bowl\n\n$7.49\n\nAccessories and Toys\n\nFerrets are curious and playful creatures, and toys are helpful for their mental and physical well-being, says Dr. Manucy.\n\nSome good options include:\n\nTunnels\n\nHammocks\n\nClimbing structures\n\nInteractive toys\n\nThese provide opportunities for play, exploration and exercise, mimicking their natural behaviors. Check out the MidWest Nation Hanging Hideaway and Marshall Ferret-Go-Round.\n\nAdditionally, cozy bedding, hideaways and plush blankets create comfortable resting spots for ferrets to relax. Just make sure you're only using ferret-safe materials, and that you regularly inspect items for wear and tear to ensure your pet's safety.\n\nMarshall Pop-N-Play Ferret Ball Pit Toy\n\n$23.34\n\nMarshall Super Thru-Way Small Animal Tunnel Toy\n\n$21.64\n\nCleaning/Upkeep\n\nYou should clean your pet ferret’s enclosure daily to maintain a clean and healthy environment. This includes removing soiled bedding, waste and food debris, as well as wiping cage surfaces. You’ll both appreciate the fresher smell.\n\nAs mentioned above, the litter box should be scooped daily, and fully cleaned and replaced with fresh litter at least once a week. Regular cleaning helps prevent odor buildup, bacterial growth and ensures the well-being of your ferrets.\n\nFerret-Proofing Materials\n\nFerrets are notorious for getting into mischief, says Dr. Manucy. It’s imperative for keepers to ferret-proof their home, which includes getting cord protectors and baby gates, and securing potential escape routes. Furniture covers can also be helpful.\n\nDr. Manucy notes that ferrets require several supervised hours outside of their cage every day for their mental and physical health. It’s a good idea to create a ferret-proofed area where they can safely and happily roam.\n\nDiet\n\nFerrets are obligate carnivores, meaning their bodies are made to digest meat-based materials. They aren’t able to process plant matter, carbohydrates and sugar (even fruits), so avoid giving them these items.\n\n“There are commercial versions of ferret food, which are the most appropriate for them since it's hard to ensure the proper amounts, and the proper quality of the balance and nutrition,” Dr. Manucy says. Some great options include the Wysong Epigen 90 Ferret Food and Marshall Ferret Food. Cat food can come in handy in a pinch, but Dr. Manucy says it’s best to stick to a ferret diet.\n\nHow Often To Feed Your Ferret\n\nFollow your vet’s guidance regarding how often to feed your ferret. Generally, you should offer your ferret small meals to help mimic their natural feeding habits. This typically means providing high-quality, protein-rich ferret food and ensuring their food bowl is always stocked.\n\nWater Requirements\n\nFresh water should be available at all times to keep your ferret hydrated, says Dr. Manucy. She also recommends changing it daily so it remains fresh and enticing, and to limit bacterial growth.\n\nAre Treats OK?\n\nDr. Manucy says she wouldn’t recommend giving your ferret treats. “Those tend to be more grain-based, and ferrets, because they're strict carnivores, don't do well with the non meat-based ingredients,” she says.\n\nWhat Not To Feed Ferrets\n\nFerrets are carnivores with sensitive digestive systems, so it's crucial to avoid feeding them certain foods, including:\n\nDairy\n\nCarbohydrates\n\nSugars\n\nHigh-fat foods\n\nPlant-based items (like fruits and vegetables)\n\nRaw meat (to avoid exposure to Salmonella or Campylobacter)\n\nAlso make sure to avoid bones, since they can splinter and injure ferrets’ GI tracts.\n\nHandling Your Ferret\n\nFerrets have long and slender bodies, which can put these small animals at risk of injury when being held, notes Dr. Manucy. It’s very important to remain gentle when picking up, holding or petting your ferret.\n\nWhen holding them, scoop them up gently, making sure to support their chest with one hand and their hindquarters with the other. Avoid grabbing or squeezing them tightly, which can stress them out. When petting, stroke their back and sides gently, and avoid touching sensitive areas like their ears or tail unless necessary.\n\nAs always, keep an eye on their body language and respect their boundaries. You can build trust through positive interactions, which will help strengthen your bond, and ensure a positive experience for both you and your pet ferret.\n\nMaintaining Your Ferret’s Health\n\nAs a pet parent, it’s important to provide ongoing ferret care to ensure your pet can lead a happy, fulfilling and healthy life.\n\nSigns of a Healthy Pet Ferret\n\nHere are some of the key signs your pet ferret is healthy, according to Dr. Manucy.\n\nShiny, full coat\n\nA healthy weight (not too thin or obese)\n\nConsistent, solid stool\n\nUrinating normally and regularly\n\nHave a sense of playfulness and good energy\n\nCommon Health Problems\n\nThese little guys are susceptible to certain diseases and illnesses like other pets. Common health issues in ferrets include the following:\n\nHairballs\n\nDental disease\n\nHeart disease\n\nAdrenal disease\n\nInsulinoma\n\nGI tract problems, including blockages caused by ingesting foreign objects\n\nRespiratory infections\n\nParasites, such as fleas, ticks and ear mites\n\nSkin conditions like dermatitis and hair loss due to poor diet or allergies\n\nWhen To See Your Vet\n\nArrange a visit with your vet as soon as you adopt your pet ferret or purchase from a breeder. At their initial checkup, your vet will inspect your ferret for signs of illness so you can treat any issues right away. They’ll also recommend certain vaccinations, including a rabies vaccine and canine distemper vaccine, since ferrets are highly susceptible to these.\n\nLike other animals, your pet ferret requires an annual vet visit. During these appointments, your vet will perform a thorough physical exam and may take blood samples to get a better idea of their current health. Early detection and prompt treatment are crucial for maintaining the health and well-being of pet ferrets.\n\nHow To Find a Ferret Vet\n\nThe American Ferret Association maintains a worldwide database of ferret veterinarians. You can also find recommendations by joining ferret owner groups and forums, where you can get word-of-mouth recommendations for trustworthy ferret vets. Some veterinarian offices that usually care for cats and dogs may be able to provide some resources as well.\n\nFAQs About Pet Ferrets\n\nQ:\n\nDo ferrets make good pets?\n\nA:A well-handled, happy and trusting ferret can be a delightful companion. Because they produce little noise, they are convenient for apartment-dwellers, and the fact that their fur sheds less dander than a cat or dog causes fewer reactions for people with allergies.\n\nQ:\n\nAre ferrets high-maintenance?\n\nA:Besides the obvious necessities of food, water, housing and veterinary care, ferrets need several hours of out-of-cage time and interaction with their keepers daily. Carefully evaluate your lifestyle and what you want from a pet before obtaining any animal.\n\nNew Pet",
      "# [10 Common Guinea Pig Behaviors Explained by Laura Willard on 2023-05-11](https://be.chewy.com/guinea-pig-behavior/)\nGuinea pigs—those adorable small animals with large heads, perpetual looks of surprise and gleeful squeals—are definitely a pet to be seen and heard. But why do they do the things they do?\n\nAs a guinea pig parent, you want to get to know your pet and form a solid bond. And one great way to do that is by understanding common guinea pig behaviors—so you know what you’re likely to come across when sharing your home with these cute little piggies.\n\nWe spoke with a guinea pig expert to round up 10 common guinea pig behaviors and explain what they mean.\n\n1Catch Me If You Can\n\nDon’t take it personally if your guinea pig runs away from you when you attempt to pick them up. Fleeing is hard-wired into the guinea pig’s psyche. Give your guinea pig time to get to know you, which may or may not curb their fleeing instincts when someone enters their space.\n\nNever chase your guinea pig, as this can cause stress. You can get your little buddy used to you by placing your hand in their cage. After they’ve become comfortable with that, you can offer pets. And after that’s gone well, you can pick them up.\n\nA guinea pig house, like the Oxbow Timothy Club Tunnel Small Animal Hideout, gives your piggy a chance to discover things that could be potentially scary from the comfort and security of their own safe space.\n\n2Do the Popcorn\n\nYes, guinea pigs (also called cavies) have their own signature dance move, and it’s called “popcorning.” The move goes a little like this: run, jump in the air, land on all fours, bounce up in the air again and turn the other way. Now imagine these moves set to the sound of popcorn popping and you will understand why it’s referred to as “popcorning.”\n\nA popcorning guinea pig is a happy piggy, and young guinea pigs tend to bust out the move quite frequently.\n\n3Freeze!\n\nGuinea pigs freeze when they feel threatened, either by noise, sudden movement or by something unfamiliar in their environment. Their goal is to be as invisible as possible.\n\nThis behavior also lets fellow guinea pigs know something might be up. Imagine Jill guinea pig socializing with Joe guinea pig, when Joe suddenly goes all statue-like on her—“Joe? Joe?” Jill will soon follow suit. As a prey animal, no guinea pig wants to bring attention to themselves when a predator might be near.\n\n4Eyes Wide Open\n\n@guineapigdoodles They seriously scare the heck out of me every time when I see them in a deep sleep with their eyes wide open🤦🏻‍♀️ #guineapigs #cavylove #smallpets #guineapigsleeping #sleepingpets #passedout #zonedout ♬ Creepy and simple horror background music(1070744) - howlingindicator\n\nIt is likely you will never see your guinea pig’s eyelids because guinea pigs rarely close their eyes—even while sleeping! All those times you thought your guinea pig was in deep thought or mesmerized by the new light fixture overhead, they might very well have been taking a quick catnap.\n\nA super-duper relaxed guinea pig might close their eyes for some sleep. If this happens, take it as a compliment—your pet feels safe and secure in their guinea pig cage.\n\n5No, He’s Not Scratching an Itch—He’s Marking\n\n@guineapigjungle WHY DO GUINEA PIGS SCENT MARK?? #guineapigs ♬ original sound - guineapigjungle\n\nIf you spy your guinea pig dragging their tush along the ground of their home environment—or any area they have frequent access to—they don’t have an itch to scratch; they are laying down their territorial claim. This is often done in new environments and in mating situations.\n\nEssentially they’re saying to other guinea pigs, “This belongs to this little piggy!”\n\n6Guinea Pig Sounds Mean Something\n\nFor being a prey animal, guinea pigs sure do make a lot of noise.\n\nWant to decipher what your guinea pig is trying to tell you? Use these guidelines.\n\nWhen they’re excited, you may hear a high-pitched squeal. One way to get a guinea pig to squeal is to hold up a favorite food for them to sniff out. They will be saying, “Dibs!” with some very audible squeals.\n\nWhen they’re relaxed, content, and feel safe, such as when you’re holding them or petting them, a guinea pig might let out a low-pitched purr that sounds like they’re “bubbling.”\n\nWhen they’re in pain, they may let out high-pitched, short squeaks or even a scream.\n\nWhen they’re annoyed, a guinea pig may make a high-pitched, short and stiff purring\n\nWhen they’re scared, guinea pigs will sometimes scream.\n\nWhen they’re hungry, they’ll making a “wheeking” sound.\n\n7Standing Up\n\nGuinea pigs might have itty bitty, barely noticeable legs, but that doesn’t keep them from standing up on two feet to get a clearer idea of what’s going on around them.\n\nThis is a “curiosity” stance that affords a guinea pig a better view of their surroundings, and it helps them zero-in on a particular smell.\n\nIt also makes them even more adorable when they beg for a food treat, like Kaytee Forti-Diet Pro Health Healthy Bits. Standing on the hind legs goes hand-in-hand with sniffing.\n\n8Licking\n\nGuinea pigs do a good bit of licking. They groom themselves by licking their fur, usually starting out by standing on their hind legs so as to better reach their front and back sides.\n\nGuinea pigs will keep themselves clean, so you likely won’t need to bathe them (unless they get mites or get themselves into a messy situation). Most guinea pigs don’t like to get wet.\n\nA guinea pig might also lick their person’s fingers/hand, which can be a sign of affection—after all, that’s how guinea pigs show affection to one another.\n\nOr, guinea pigs might just be licking to comfort themselves.\n\n9Mad Little Piggy!\n\nGuinea pigs can have a temper. A mad guinea pig might hiss, which can sound like they are chattering their teeth together. And if you see their teeth too, watch out! Your little piggy means business—back off!\n\nAn upset guinea pig might also let out a high-pitched shriek to tell you that they are very unhappy with something you did or that they feel threatened.\n\nThese behaviors are done to display aggression to indicate they don’t like something or they want you to stay away. Don’t ignore them!\n\n10Head-Raising Bragging Rights\n\nGuinea pigs show their dominance over other guinea pigs by raising their heads, which is reportedly their way of showing up one another.\n\nIn guinea pig social circles, the higher the head, the studlier the guinea pig.\n\nA Few More Guinea Pig Behaviors Worth Noting\n\nIt helps to decode your guinea pig’s actions to help keep them healthy and happy. Keep an eye out for the following behaviors that could indicate your guinea pig is struggling:\n\nGuinea pigs who are lacking in enrichment activities may chew on the bars of their cages.\n\nGuinea pigs who are experiencing stress may show you by hiding as well as through their body language, like freezing. They may also have a lack of appetite or experience diarrhea.\n\nWhen guinea pigs don’t feel safe in their environment or they’re lacking adequate hiding places, they may chew out their hair (or “self-barber”).\n\nQ:Can behaviors change after you spay or neuter your guinea pig?\n\nA:If you’re planning to house two male guinea pigs together, it’s important to neuter them. When unaltered, they can become aggressive toward one another and engage in fighting.\n\nSuch an environment affects a guinea pig’s health by increasing their stress level, which can lower testosterone, lead to fur loss and weight loss, lower their immune system and cause them to stop eating and drinking.\n\nQ:Do guinea pigs engage in enrichment activities?\n\nA:Yes, they have fun digging and burrowing, trying new food items and exploring.\n\nLearning common guinea pig behaviors is a great first step toward getting to know your tiny companion. Now that you have that knowledge, you can put it to use. Piggies are smart and are capable of learning basic commands.

      "# [Rabbit Ate Chocolate by Chewy Editorial on 2013-10-04](https://be.chewy.com/rabbit-ate-chocolate/)\nQ.\n\nMy rabbit accidentally at a small piece of chocolate. What should I do?\n\nA.\n\nIt is likely that if it was a small piece of chocolate, no harm will come to your rabbit. But if your rabbit was to eat a large amount of chocolate, that is a very serious situation that means an emergency visit to the veterinarian’s office.\n\nChocolate candy is very dangerous to all animals. The active ingredient in chocolate, theobromine, is metabolized much slower in animals than in people, and it can build up to toxic concentrations in animals that ingest too much chocolate. This can cause multi-organ disease and failure if not treated properly.\n\nThe treatment used in dogs and cats that ingest chocolate is to induce vomiting to remove the chocolate from the stomach. We cannot do that in rabbits, because rabbits cannot vomit. This leaves us with a difficult dilemma on how to treat without being invasive.\n\nSometimes veterinarians can use a stomach tube to remove and dilute the chocolate that is remaining in the stomach, but this is not always successful. Also, most chocolate candy contains fat and sugar, which are other sources of danger for rabbits. Fat and sugar can cause a severe imbalance in the intestinal tract, which leads to stasis, anorexia and, eventually, liver disease.\n\nIf what your rabbit ate was a small amount of chocolate and your rabbit appears fine, then likely this was not enough to cause disease. It still is a good idea to visit your veterinarian to have some basic blood tests done to make sure that there are no longer ill effects from eating chocolate.\n\nLike this article?

      "# [Beagle by BeChewy on 2021-04-16](https://be.chewy.com/dog-breed/beagle/)\nBreed Snapshot\n\nLife Expectancy:\n\n10 to 15 years\n\nSize:\n\nSmall\n\nMaintenance Level:\n\nMedium\n\nShed Level:\n\nLow\n\nTemperament:\n\nHigh-EnergyIntelligentLoyal\n\nCoat Color:\n\nTricolorLemonRedWhite\n\nBest For\n\nBeagles, small and friendly, thrive on activity and companionship. With an affectionate nature and keen sense of smell, they make excellent family pets. They're ideal for those seeking a playful and energetic canine friend who flourishes with love and outdoor adventures.\n\nBeagle Traits\n\nBeagle Temperament\n\nThe Beagle’s temperament is generally joyful, determined and adventurous. They’re spunky dogs who typically get along well with others, and their curious personality means they love to play and explore.\n\nCouch potatoes they are not! In fact, they need a lot of exercise and thrive when given a job to do. They were originally bred to track and hunt game, and you’ll often see them with their nose to the ground. At times they can be too driven by scents. Don’t be surprised if they smell something interesting and take off!\n\nKnown for their intelligence, a bored Beagle may get themselves into trouble. Don’t worry—Beagles are happy to tell you when they need more stimulation with their attention-getting vocalizations. A cross between a bark and a howl, the unmistakable Beagle “baying” is sharper than a bark but not as drawn out as a howl. Beagles love to join in when they hear other dogs howling or when they want to express themselves with their “Beagle noises.”\n\nAgility training, scent work or tracking classes might be good activities to explore with these smart, strong-willed dogs. (Psst, the National Beagle Club is a good resource for events and other activities for this breed.)\n\nWhile a Beagle puppy can be mouthy and chew things they shouldn’t (just like any other puppy!), the Beagle breed isn’t expected to have aggressive tendencies as an adult. These social, family dogs get along well with children and are great for active families. And since they were originally bred for hunting in packs, they also do well with other dogs, although they may need more time to adjust to cat households.\n\nHow to Care for a Beagle\n\nBeagles are always up for a good time. While that might sometimes translate into your pup being a little mischievous at times, raising a Beagle can be a fun and rewarding experience. That being said, it’s always helpful to know what you’re getting yourself into ahead of time, so the following Beagle information is our primer on the basics of caring for this sweet and gentle breed.\n\nBeagle Health\n\nSeveral health problems are commonly seen in Beagles. While you won’t necessarily come across these in your dog, it’s good to know what to keep an eye out for—from eye issues to joint concerns—so your Beagle can live their life as happy and healthy as possible.\n\nCherry Eye: Cherry eye is the common term for prolapse of the gland of the third eyelid. It’s usually due to a weakness of the connective tissue that normally holds the gland in place, and appears as a pink or red bulge in the front corner of the eye. It is not usually painful but can be irritating for the dog, and often requires surgery to fix. It is not preventable and can happen to dogs at any age, but it most often occurs in dogs younger than 2 years old.\n\nIntervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD): IVDD is a neurological condition that occurs when one or more of the discs found between the vertebrae of the spine slip or rupture, causing the disc material to press on the dog’s spinal cord. It can be very painful, and your dog may be suddenly paralyzed or not able to use their back legs. Weight control is one important way to prevent this from happening.\n\nDental Disease: Beagles tend to experience more dental disease than other dogs their size. It’s recommended to start dental care when they are puppies, as periodontal disease can lead to teeth loss and even more serious issues like heart, liver and kidney disease.\n\nHip Dysplasia: Hip dysplasia is a condition that occurs as a dog grows, causing the hip joints to develop improperly. The result is instability or looseness of the hip joint, and eventually leads to cartilage wear and degenerative arthritis over time. Arthritis can further lead to muscle weakness and joint stiffness, as well as pain. This condition is typically diagnosed with x-rays. Treatments range from the nonsurgical, like weight reduction and physical therapy, to surgical, depending on the severity. Because hip dysplasia has a genetic predisposition, affected dogs should not be bred.\n\nLuxating Patella: Luxating patella (kneecap) is a condition that occurs when the groove that holds the patella in position is too shallow, allowing the patella to escape its normal position when the knee joint bends and straightens. This condition is seen more commonly in smaller breeds and does not always cause discomfort. but it can lead to other painful problems, like torn cruciate ligaments, arthritis and more.\n\nEpilepsy: Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder that affects the brain and results in recurrent seizures. Epilepsy is diagnosed when all other causes of seizures have been investigated and ruled out. Epilepsy ranges in severity, with some dogs experiencing seizures very rarely and others as often as daily. Depending on the severity, medications are available to control the seizure activity.\n\nHypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is one of the most common endocrine disorders in dogs and is caused by decreased activity of the thyroid gland due to inflammation or atrophy. Hypothyroidism can be diagnosed through blood testing, so thyroid levels should be a normal part of screening bloodwork as Beagles age. This condition can be managed with medications.\n\nBeagle History\n\nWhile the breed’s exact origins aren’t exactly clear, reports of small hounds hunting hares in Britain date back as far as 55 B.C. As time went on, larger hounds were bred for tracking down deer, and smaller hounds were bred for rabbit hunting. Modern Beagles are most likely descendants of smaller hunting hounds from the 1500s. Around that time, Beagles became popular as “foot hounds,” meaning that—unlike with larger hound breeds—one could hunt with a pack of Beagles on foot instead of on horseback.\n\nBeagles arrived in the United States after the Civil War, and “Blunder” was the first Beagle recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1885. The breed has always been popular among rabbit hunters and is one of the most popular dog breeds among families today, ranking as the seventh-most-popular dog by the AKC.\n\nLooking to make a Beagle part of your family? You can find a list of reputable breeders on the AKC’s website. Working with a reputable breeder usually means you’re getting a puppy who’s been screened for health issues and temperament. Depending on the breeder, a Beagle price can range from $350 to $1,500, with an average of about $500 to $850. Propsective pet parents can also adopt from Beagle rescue groups, keep an eye out for the breed at their local animal shelter, or search Chewy’s database of adoptable dogs in your area. .\n\nFAQs\n\nAre Beagles hypoallergenic?\n\nNo, Beagles are not hypoallergenic. Like many working dogs, the breed has a double coat, which means they have a soft undercoat and coarse outercoat. This helps keep them warm but also means they shed seasonally in the spring and winter.\n\nDo Beagles bark a lot?\n\nBeagles are known for barking and howling to express themselves. Keeping your Beagle busy and ensuring they get enough exercise is the best way to reduce their vocalizations. You can also train them to learn “quiet” as a command, but controlling their environment will help (not leaving them alone in the yard for long periods, etc.).\n\nAre Beagles good with cats?\n\nBeagles may require some training to learn they aren’t supposed to chase cats. If a puppy grew up around the cat, it probably would be fine. But bringing in an older Beagle where they’ve never had a cat might take a little bit of work.\n\nWhat are the most common beagle mixes?\n\nBeagle-Harrier mix (Beagle Harrier)\n\nBeagle-Labrador mix (Beagador)\n\nBeagle-Chihuahua mix (Cheagle)\n\nBeagle-Husky mix (Beaski)\n\nBeagle-Pug mix (Puggle)\n\nBeagle-German Shepherd mix (Beagle Shepherd)\n\nBeagle-English Springer Spaniel mix (Spreagle)\n\nBeagle-Miniature Pinscher mix (Meagle)\n\nBeagle-Dachshund mix (Doxle)\n\nBeagle-Poodle mix (Beaglepoo)\n\nBeagle-Boxer mix (Boggle)\n\nBeagle-Border Collie mix (Border Beagle),\n\nBeagle-Pekingese mix (Peagle)\n\nNote: These are not purebred dogs but mixed breeds.\n\nTop Takeaways\n\nBeagles make great pets for active families who have the time and energy to invest in this breed. Beagles are smart, curious, and fun to have around. But they can be destructive and loud when left to their own devices. It takes some effort to train them properly, but you will be rewarded with a loyal family member for life.\n\nSearch for Adoptable Beagles Near You\n\nPlease enter your ZIP code:\n\nTop Beagle Names\n\nThese are the top Beagle names as chosen by Chewy's pet parents!\n\nFemale Names\n\nDaisy\n\nBella\n\nLucy\n\nLuna\n\nBailey\n\nMolly\n\nPenny\n\nSadie\n\nWillow\n\nMaggie\n\nMale Names\n\nCooper\n\nCopper\n\nCharlie\n\nMilo\n\nMax\n\nBuddy\n\nTucker\n\nHank\n\nRocky\n\nOliver\n\nRelated Breeds\n\nSee breeds similar in size and pet care needs as the Beagle\n\nSee All Breeds"

No refund.  No replacement.   Well, guess what?  Chewy isn’t the only option. You just lost a loyal customer who spends a good amount of money with you every 2 weeks or so.  I’m not sure if they’re using chat bot was AI or human, but it’s not the service you used to deliver.",

It’s extremely rare, but any time something is wrong they resolve the problem completely without hesitation. There is no automated message when you call. Of the dozens of times I’ve called, a human in America has answered by the second ring. They’re friendly and always ask about my cats by name. A few times I’ve had to tell them about one who had passed away, a few days later I get a hand written sympathy card from them. \nOrdering prescription food and medicine is a breeze. You place the order online, they call the vet for authorization, and they always ship immediately. \nThey have a service where you can have a 20 minute virtual vet visit for 20.00. I’ve used it many times. I’ve used it after having an in-person visit and then think of more questions afterward, doesn’t that always happen? I’ve been able to send them pictures, X-rays and bloodwork results. They read them for me and help me understand whatever I didn’t understand at the office. These vets are great and always finish up by sending a summary of the visit and their recommendations. And they send relative articles for your information. I’ve tried the free nurse line through my pet insurance, all they do is tell you to go to the vet. Chewy’s vets actually help you avoid an office visit and will only send you if they know it’s necessary. \nThank you for everything, Chewy!! 😻",

They are amazing with their customers. We got our new kitten a little less than 1.5 years ago and we weren’t sure what she was going to end up eating at first. As soon as we brought her home, we ordered the same wet & dry food that her breeder had been feeding her. As she started displaying various neurological symptoms, she began eating less and struggling to chew food. We became worried about giving her any wet food that wasn’t the consistency of baby food because she was starting to cough when she was eating. At about 6 months old, her vet sedated her to make sure there was nothing in the way of her throat. While at her visit, the vet fed her a Rx diet food that she absolutely loved by comparison to the wet food we were giving her. By switching to the prescription wet food exclusively, she started putting on weight again…even though she remained very small. Chewy helped us make the switch by running it through her vet’s office for the authorization of the Rx food. Then, they refunded us for the remaining wet and dry food that she’d stopped eating. This site even recommended that we donate the remaining food we had to a locate shelter or humane society (after they’d refunded us in full for the cost of this food). The people who answered the phone really showed us how much they cared about not just our little one, but about encouraging their customers to donate the refunded food to help local animal populations when other companies would have insisted the food be shipped back to them, even if they only ended up throwing it out or destroying it. \nI trust them with all of our purchases for kitty, Sadie. They free us up to focus on giving her whatever diet best supports her health. This has been so helpful as we’ve adjusted to her changing needs. They even sent us a card and a toy after hearing about Sadie’s difficulties! It’s rare to find a company that legitimately cares for their customers. \nI love this company and I’ll remain a customer forever. \nThanks to Chewy and all the representatives who work for them by answer the phone. This company behaves in such a refreshingly empathic way. I recommend them to everyone I ever talk to about their pets. \n\nJen, Ephraim & Sadie",

The Customer Service are absolutely fantastic!!  Mistakes happen, orders come late or sometimes are wrong but I have no problem calling Chewy customer support because I know the problem will be resolved immediately and they will always go the the extra mile to make sure their customers are completely satisfied, happy and never have to spend time on the phone with someone who is rude and reads from a binder refusing to help.  Amazon customer service could learn what true customer service is.  \nOn a personal note.  Earlier this year, my dog “Bo” was senselessly attacked and stabbed as a result.  His emergency vet bills were extremely expensive and I needed to cancel my Chewy Auto Ship.  It wasn’t caught in time and part of the order already was in transit.  The customer service team told me not to worry and just keep the item in transit.  I couldn’t believe the kindness and generosity of Chewy.  Thankfully my dog Bo recovered but it was a horrific experience.  \nA few days after the incident, a package arrived from Chewy in the mail.  It was a Beautiful Get Well gift and Card for my dog Bo.  It had a lovely handwritten note and was personally signed by the customer care team.  Me and my family were and still are so grateful and deeply touched by such a wonderful gesture from a large corporation.\n\nI hope the Corporate realizes how lucky they are to have such wonderful people who make an impact in a world where people like me have a lot of choices where we spend our money.  Since this incident, I recommend Chewy to everyone!  I work in animal rescue and constantly brag about your amazing people.

They sent me a beautiful arrangement of plants after my 18 year old cat, Hunter Dean, passed away. \n\nTheir pharmacy team always works hard to make sure their patients get the meds they need and patiently work with busy vets. They always have a kind and patient temperament. I always have a great chat with them. I really hope they keep their human workers because, honestly, it’s a huge strength for this company. The genuine, heartfelt empathy during my grief was welcome, especially in a world that doesn’t pause. \n\nIf I’ve ever had a problem, they are quick to resolve it with sincerity and understanding. That’s so rare! \n\nI really enjoy the promo codes. It makes for a fun experience when shopping. I’ve gotten some really awesome products from them over the years and, more often than not, they’re providing better prices for new products. \n\nThe auto ship feature is a godsend also. In the instance of owning a senior pet or a pet with special needs it brings a ton of peace to your world knowing it’ll come in regularly with little intervention on your part. And, because I also manage a stable of horses, I can focus on doing my job and I don’t have to rush to the vet for refills anymore. \n\nI really enjoy the personalized cards as well.

I wanted cat food every 6 months, and treats every 3 months, but that's not possible with chewy's system. Also, it offered $20 off the 1st autoship, plus I had a 15$ off promo sent to me by chewy.

I’ve used it many times. I’ve used it after having an in-person visit and then think of more questions afterward, doesn’t that always happen? I’ve been able to send them pictures, X-rays and bloodwork results. They read them for me and help me understand whatever I didn’t understand at the office. These vets are great and always finish up by sending a summary of the visit and their recommendations. And they send relative articles for your information. I’ve tried the free nurse line through my pet insurance, all they do is tell you to go to the vet. Chewy’s vets actually help you avoid an office visit and will only send you if they know it’s necessary. \nThank you for everything, Chewy!! 😻",

They have great quality products for your pets, customer service is astonishing and overall is an easy platform to operate. Recently I had to cancel a dog food subscription due to health issues in our dog. However, a big bag of food was already on the way that we could no longer feed our dog with. They said they will refund me the full amount. I said “how will I return it to you guys?” She replied-donate it to a local shelter. I have never seen a company actually care about anything other than themselves. Chewy cares about your animals needs, and all the others that might not have found a home yet. That is something I think so highly of and I hope others do as well. Thank you Chewy for having the morals that you do.",

I’m not a huge fan of ordering things that I can buy in the store, but their prices are competitive, they have a huge variety of products, and recommend and remind you of vet visits when it’s that time again. Bonus: your orders are stored so if your animal loves something but you can’t remember the name or product you can just review your history.

      "# Amazing Customer Service!!, 5 stars [(jrosenberg21, Apple App Store, 2024-09-12)](https://apple/11718248694)\nThis is my favorite website with which to do business. They are amazing with their customers. We got our new kitten a little less than 1.5 years ago and we weren’t sure what she was going to end up eating at first. As soon as we brought her home, we ordered the same wet & dry food that her breeder had been feeding her. As she started displaying various neurological symptoms, she began eating less and struggling to chew food. We became worried about giving her any wet food that wasn’t the consistency of baby food because she was starting to cough when she was eating. At about 6 months old, her vet sedated her to make sure there was nothing in the way of her throat. While at her visit, the vet fed her a Rx diet food that she absolutely loved by comparison to the wet food we were giving her. By switching to the prescription wet food exclusively, she started putting on weight again…even though she remained very small. Chewy helped us make the switch by running it through her vet’s office for the authorization of the Rx food. Then, they refunded us for the remaining wet and dry food that she’d stopped eating. This site even recommended that we donate the remaining food we had to a locate shelter or humane society (after they’d refunded us in full for the cost of this food). The people who answered the phone really showed us how much they cared about not just our little one, but about encouraging their customers to donate the refunded food to help local animal populations when other companies would have insisted the food be shipped back to them, even if they only ended up throwing it out or destroying it. \nI trust them with all of our purchases for kitty, Sadie. They free us up to focus on giving her whatever diet best supports her health. This has been so helpful as we’ve adjusted to her changing needs. They even sent us a card and a toy after hearing about Sadie’s difficulties! It’s rare to find a company that legitimately cares for their customers. \nI love this company and I’ll remain a customer forever. \nThanks to Chewy and all the representatives who work for them by answer the phone. This company behaves in such a refreshingly empathic way. I recommend them to everyone I ever talk to about their pets. \n\nJen, Ephraim & Sadie",

      "# Chewy is the Best Corporation with the Best Customer Service, 5 stars [(#1doggieFan, Apple App Store, 2024-09-04)](https://apple/11689158075)\nI have never had a problem or a bad experience in dealing with Chewy!  The Customer Service are absolutely fantastic!!  Mistakes happen, orders come late or sometimes are wrong but I have no problem calling Chewy customer support because I know the problem will be resolved immediately and they will always go the the extra mile to make sure their customers are completely satisfied, happy and never have to spend time on the phone with someone who is rude and reads from a binder refusing to help.  Amazon customer service could learn what true customer service is.  \nOn a personal note.  Earlier this year, my dog “Bo” was senselessly attacked and stabbed as a result.  His emergency vet bills were extremely expensive and I needed to cancel my Chewy Auto Ship.  It wasn’t caught in time and part of the order already was in transit.  The customer service team told me not to worry and just keep the item in transit.  I couldn’t believe the kindness and generosity of Chewy.  Thankfully my dog Bo recovered but it was a horrific experience.  \nA few days after the incident, a package arrived from Chewy in the mail.  It was a Beautiful Get Well gift and Card for my dog Bo.  It had a lovely handwritten note and was personally signed by the customer care team.  Me and my family were and still are so grateful and deeply touched by such a wonderful gesture from a large corporation.\n\nI hope the Corporate realizes how lucky they are to have such wonderful people who make an impact in a world where people like me have a lot of choices where we spend our money.  Since this incident, I recommend Chewy to everyone!  I work in animal rescue and constantly brag about your amazing people.  I know I am just one person but I would rather pay higher prices and have better service than deal with awful service, like Amazon for example.\nThank you",

I thought this was so cool and thoughtful and solidified my love for chewy.

I hear great stories about them and how much they actually care about pet owners. They have a super wide selection of items at good items and our kittens have loved everything from Chewy we’ve ordered. HOWEVER there is one glitch in the app that’s making it near impossible for me to use. Whenever you are browsing items and select one, once you go back to your search results, they’re gone and you have to do the search all over again. This happens when you click through their preset categories to browse too, every time you go in/out of an item it takes you back too far. Please fix this!

And he loved TikiDog wet food. But he wouldn’t touch the Tikidog dry lamb. I let Chewy know and they refunded me. I assumed they were then going to ask me to drop off the refunded product somewhere but instead they said to donate it to a shelter. So I did. Their chat service is very helpful. I even messaged them at midnight once because I kept forgetting to during the day and their response is fast. \n\nI’ve only had one order mess up in the 7 months I’ve been a customer.

I called customer service and spoke to Jeremy. He was fantastic! He was genuinely empathic, apologized for the issues and immediately assured me he would do everything he could to rectify the problem. Then he proceeded to do so. He had to get his supervisor involved, but ultimately expidited a new shipment while we were on the phone and issued a credit. Truly appreciate the sincere concern, taking ownership of the issue, and the resolution. This was a model of customer service excellence by Jeremy!",

Deleted the app itself off my phone and won’t use them again.\n\nWent to order some dog food because I received a coupon in the mail. Normally I order my dog’s food with Amazon but I figured what the heck. So I placed the order thinking nothing of it. But then I get an email asking to verify that I made the transaction before they can fill it. They want me to jump through hoops with a long list of requested information to provide them to verify that I placed the order. Even though I was helped with their customer support team over the phone when placing the order!\n\nI am not going to jump through hoops for anyone let alone when ordering my dog’s dog food. And the fact that I am NOT A NEW CUSTOMER but an established customer who has placed and received many orders over the last 5 years or so. But no more. Back to Amazon. You can keep your $15 coupon as the work you try to force customers to do is not worth the “savings”. Goodbye.",

They sent me a beautiful arrangement of plants after my 18 year old cat, Hunter Dean, passed away. \n\nTheir pharmacy team always works hard to make sure their patients get the meds they need and patiently work with busy vets. They always have a kind and patient temperament. I always have a great chat with them. I really hope they keep their human workers because, honestly, it’s a huge strength for this company. The genuine, heartfelt empathy during my grief was welcome, especially in a world that doesn’t pause. \n\nIf I’ve ever had a problem, they are quick to resolve it with sincerity and understanding. That’s so rare! \n\nI really enjoy the promo codes. It makes for a fun experience when shopping. I’ve gotten some really awesome products from them over the years and, more often than not, they’re providing better prices for new products. \n\nThe auto ship feature is a godsend also. In the instance of owning a senior pet or a pet with special needs it brings a ton of peace to your world knowing it’ll come in regularly with little intervention on your part. And, because I also manage a stable of horses, I can focus on doing my job and I don’t have to rush to the vet for refills anymore. \n\nI really enjoy the personalized cards as well. They are fantastic and a fun thing to receive. \n\nThank you Chewy!",

Its the only way that it makes sense:\n\n  \n I added items to my Chewy, then logged into my account to check out. That’s when I noticed my total was really high, I went to my cart and there was $100 gift card that had obviously been in my cart prior to me logging in. In my cart it showed the email the gift card was going to. Obviously, I screenshot it & removed from my cart. I didn’t even check out. Changed my Chewy password. Googled the email address & it is a doctor at in New York at John Hopkins University (obviously not a hacker). I went under my payments to delete my information & noticed that the PayPal account connected is a recently defunct account because of a dispute of unauthorized charges!!! Then, I was curious about what other information they had about “me” in my account, & what under addresses there were my actual personal addresses & an unknown additional New York address with MY NAME. it’s definitely some kind of spiderweb of personal information however, it is definitely definitely definitely PayPal and chewy combined that are both the problem here.

They answered immediately, clearly not outsourced as it was the least frustrating fraud call I've ever experienced. I assumed this was brand new, today and they hadn't alerted anyone yet. Now I'm concerned they were aware. I'm wondering if their site had a vulnerability, maybe a former IT employee or pen tester (they test sites for penetration vulnerability, can be hired or freelance going off bug bounties), even a hacker. \n\nWhen white hat (good guy) hackers find vulnerabilities, they'll report it to the site, sometimes they'll earn a \"bug bounty\", like 'hey I found this, your IT Dept should repair it, I just saved you $$$, pay me for it').  On the other hand, someone could have found it, reported it, it wasn't acknowledged the way they felt they deserved, and they reposted the vulnerability for others to expose. And then there are the hackers who don't even try to report it, they just try to sell the vulnerability.

Four random pet plushy toys were ordered and the order summary emailed to my wife, plus an earlier email noting that the account's email had been changed (to my wife's).\n\nThe fun wrinkle is: we do not have a Chewy account.\n\nBy studying the emails my wife got, and then calling Chewy customer service and talking to Noah, who was genuinely apologetic, I think the theory explained below (fraudulent seller working with compromised Chewy accounts) is maybe correct.\n\nSomeone's real Chewy account with a weak password becomes compromised by hacker.  Hacker changes the email address (and maybe shipping address) on the account, and then places orders for random stuff.  This is charged to the original account owner's PayPal / credit card.\n\nThe shipping address person is perhaps innocent, and the original account owner as well.\n\nBut what I'm unsure of is: I don't think Chewy supports 3rd party sellers (unlike Amazon).

It may be related to a shady site, but I don't think the scammers are straight drop shipping since so many people are having identical scam orders sent to different addresses.My Chewy password was an old weak one that I have mostly stopped using, so I'm sure it was in a previous data breach. They also changed the email and pw for my account, but I still got order confirmations from both Chewy and PayPal. Chewy customer support was great and canceled the orders. It seems weird that PayPal is the preferred payment method, my guess is that the backend fraud checks for separate billing/shipping addresses is weaker with PayPal than with the stored credit cards, so more fake orders are getting through when they use PayPal.\n\n### Comment ID ici93hh with +2 score by [(OkSheepherder6676, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/tg0non/chewy_hack/ici93hh/) (in reply to ID icdcbzk):\ncorrect. when orders are paid with paypal, we don’t receive any billing address info in our system. 9 times out of 10 it bypasses our fraud prevention system unless the hacker is using a VPN, among a few other factors\n\n### Comment ID idim29l with +2 score by [(softerthings, Reddit, 2022-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/tg0non/chewy_hack/idim29l/) (in reply to ID icdcbzk):\nI noticed the same address set up.

My account was one of those \"flagged\" and I'm still struggling to get it \"unflagged\". The CSR's do a fantastic job repairing the damage the anti-fraud system has done, only to have the anti-fraud system undo everything they just did. \n\nIt's reached the point where I've actually sent a letter to the corporate headquarters, suggesting that it might be a good idea to call in the head of IT and make it abundantly clear that allowing an overzealous \"anti-fraud system\" to continue unchecked is not in their best interests.\n\n## Comment ID ictoy8b with +2 score by [(Rebekac12, Reddit, 2022-06-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/tg0non/chewy_hack/ictoy8b/) (in reply to ID tg0non):\nHappened on my account a few days ago and my friends account last night.

It's DEFINITELY nothing I ordered- nothing drop shipment either but I have had something drop shipped from them via an eBay seller very recently (but that's already been delivered). Perhaps said eBay seller got hacked too??

Nothing shows on my account either. Thankfully no fraudulent charges to speak of on my end, but I feel for you guys!

I looked up the guy who ordered from my Paypal, and he is 78 years old, don't really think he would know how to scam, but you never know. I am thinking of  reporting it to online fraud, maybe they can look into it further. He ordered \"Gentle Giants Canine Nutrition Chicken Dry Dog Food, 30-lb bag\" and some other stuff the emails won't show, and I found a bunch of ebay listings for it.

I thought that odd and went back to bed.  In the morning I went to Safari and when I went to log into my Chewy account the username that came up in the Browser window defaulted to 'myusername.amzltd.net'.

Chewy canceled the order.  I changed my password and then called Apple and spent a couple of hours going through my computer. All looked fine.  Installed Malwarebytes and did a complete scan.  All good.  However I still couldn't let go of this nagging feeling and came to Reddit.

Received a confirmation email this afternoon for a Chewy order of 25 lb bag of dog food, but the person listed her name and address so it was easy to see it both a. was something I don’t normally order and b. to someone who lives across the US from me with a totally different name and not one of my previously used shipment locations. I immediately called Chewy customer service and the rep said the order was pending so she could quickly and easily cancel it and remove my payment information (I use a card not PayPal when making Chewy orders) then do a password reset. I was nervous this person took down my personal info but so far the only charge on my card is the pending Chewy one that should be gone in a couple days due to cancellation, so hopefully this person just tried for some free dog food that she’ll never receive on my dime. I was hoping she didn’t have my card or contact info just somehow access to my account, unfortunately! I’m grateful I didn’t have pushback from Chewy when I said I didn’t order this food, but maybe it’s because this is happening semi-regularly.\n\n## Comment ID i9hxkea with +1 score by [(nusscracker896, Reddit, 2022-05-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/tg0non/chewy_hack/i9hxkea/) (in reply to ID tg0non):\nSame thing happened to me a few weeks ago. 3 random orders all sent to random address around the United states and they turned on an old auto subscription that I had turned off.  \nChewy customer service was great and refunded me all the fradualant charges immediately.

Chewy flagged my orders (which I legitimately placed) and I received an email saying \"please contact Customer Service regarding your recent order\".  I also believe this is an internal error with Chewy's order system.  It happened to me recently as well. About 2 weeks ago, I ordered my dog's prescription food, which she's been on for almost 3 years and I received the fraud email. The c/s rep said she would release the order, which she never did. I had to call two days later and then spoke to someone who in turn THEN released the order. I asked them \"why doesn't your Fraud Dept. look at the order? It's a product I always buy and the name/address and pet name are the same?  Then last night, I received an email from Chewy stating the flea/tick preventative I ordered was flagged for fraud. I called c/s and she said she would contact her supervisor and the fraud department, but the item won't ship until later in the week. \n\nI realize Chewy is trying to be proactive here, but something isn't adding up.

But feel free to delete if this is really the wrong place!)\n\nBased on my two recent experiences, I’m convinced this is the best company out there and I’d love to hear more good tales about them just to keep my good faith. \n\nI recently ordered the wrong type of leash for my dog. Asked about a return/exchange. They said, “we’ll refund you, but don’t worry about returning it. Just donate it to a local shelter or rescue!”\n\nAmazing! I will!\n\nThen I ordered the right type of leash and then accidentally sent me two. So I send a message saying “it’s no skin off my back since I didn’t pay for two, but if you want it back I’ll send it back.” And they were like “oops! Accidents happen. Go ahead and donate it to a shelter or rescue.”\n\nLike, I’m sure they get some sort of write off for this. And both leashes together were not even $35 they lost. But how often does this happen? Do the little things adding up not make as big of a dent in their profits as it’s worth? They could easily ask for these things back and keep their stock up so they can resell them. But they’re choosing to let me donate them instead?\n\nSeems like a really good company and it makes me feel better about ordering from them instead of shopping at my local pet store, which didn’t carry the leash I needed anyway, but I felt bad nonetheless.\n\n\n\n## Comment ID hui0bdr with +53 score by [(rike103, Reddit, 2022-01-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/sea3aa/anyone_have_a_good_experience_with_chewy/hui0bdr/) (in reply to ID sea3aa):\nChewy is awsome they messed up on my order the first time and made it up by not only giving me an extra bag of food but they threw in some treats,they occasionally throw free stuff with my orders\n\n## Comment ID hui18i1 with +65 score by [(atlantisgate, Reddit, 2022-01-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/sea3aa/anyone_have_a_good_experience_with_chewy/hui18i1/) (in reply to ID sea3aa):\nI appreciate that they are willing to do stuff like this, and I do order from them pretty often as a result. There have been a few orders here and there over the years that have had damaged product, or just little stuff like that that happens, and they are always hassle free for me to deal with when that crops up.\n\nI also have to shout out their fast shipping, especially as a car-free human. It's really great to have stuff I need get here fast when since not that easy for me to run out and pick something up.\n\nOn the other hand, I know they undercut vet's offices in drug pricing on purpose, and it's to their benefit to write off a $10 leash if they get a customer who will always get expensive prescriptions from them.\n\nThey can be a real pain in the ass with prescription information with vet offices. I once had trouble getting something filled, and my vet told me multiple times they HAD faxed the paperwork to Chewy, but Chewy kept telling me they needed my vet to respond; My vet showed me the logs and they absolutely were in the right. Lots of vets struggle with them.\n\nSo yes! In many ways a great company, especially for consumers.

They refunded her money so she could get something locally while she waited for her shipment to arrive.  \n\nI see other comments that the pharmacy side has problems, but I haven’t encountered that yet, and my vet tells me to get some of our meds through them, so they don’t seem to be having trouble yet.  \n\nThat said, I still go to local small shops for treats and toys and stuff like that.

My wife and I are adopting a dog on Saturday. In preparation for our dog we shopped around to see which store would be cheapest for supplies. Between Amazon, Petsmart, Petco, and Chewy, Chewy was the cheapest by far, and had great reviews for their in house label. We ordered about $300 dollars worth of supplies. The shipment came in 4 different boxes. During shipment FedEx tracking noted 1 box was damaged. The bottle of urine cleaner had leaked or broken. We could tell because FedEx repackaged it and the cleaner was missing. Without us contacting Chewy support, Chewy resent the whole order. Not just the urine cleaner.

I ordered an inhouse medicine and i think the dosage was wrong, because my dog got sick, so i just wrote a bad review and i was credited for the bad meds, i ordered this inhouse med because my usual one was backordered for months and i was desperate. I use Chewys for all of my medicine purchases for my 16 year old dog, he is on more than five plus vet prescription dog food. I highly recommend them.

He was having some health problems at the time.  When the box arrived, the box was destroyed. The treat tin was damaged, a toy was missing and it seriously looked like it had been run over by a truck.  I called them bawling. At the time we thought it would be my boy's last birthday and I was devastated that everything in the box was damaged.  All it took was a phone call and emailing a few photos and they replaced everything, threw in some extra treats, and extra toy, and a birthday card about how he was\"the bestest boy\" and they were sorry and it was signed by several people.  Even though it was the shipping company fault, they made it right.\n\n## Comment ID huk0psx with +1 score by [(SpecialKayla, Reddit, 2022-01-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/sea3aa/anyone_have_a_good_experience_with_chewy/huk0psx/) (in reply to ID sea3aa):\nWe get our dog and rats food on autoship!

When my dog had an allergic reaction to a can food id bought my girlfriend insisted I contact them to send the remaining cans back since he’d only eaten one can and their website says you can return if you’re unsatisfied. They sent me another flavor free of charge of the same brand an encouraged me to donate the remaining unopened cans to a shelter. They even added a little note for my dog saying they hoped he was feeling better and “ready to eat”\n\nAlso I don’t think it counts towards their tax since the donation isn’t coming from them . It’s coming from you to your shelter or rescue and not directly from their company. But I could be wrong. \n\nI genuinely think they are just a good company built but pet people for pet people.

In February a Chewy box that was delivered had a shard of glass under the label that punctured my finger deeply. It had to be glued closed, ended up getting infected and needing more treatment, and because I'm a massage therapist I was out of work for a week. After going back and forth with them for a while they simply stated \"we won't be doing anything for you\". Like not even a coupon or something?? It was a freak situation, and I know it's not their negligence necessarily... But it left a bad taste in my mouth and I just don't want to give them my money anymore. Any suggestions are much appreciated, thanks. 🙏\n\n\nETA: I shouldn't be surprised I suppose, but the amount of people who are pissed about this post (why?) and are now looking through my comment history is kind of wild. Even pulling quotes. You guys should take a break, Reddit must be raising your blood pressure and I worry for your health. (Though at least one of them is someone I know in real life that for some reason loves to reply to me on Reddit with new accounts to say mean shit.) \n\nNote to self: don't ask for help on Reddit. Sheesh.\n\nAll of the costumer service reps I spoke with over the course of several weeks -- who contacted ME by the way -- were absolutely lovely. It was the big kahuna at the end who first wanted me to send him ask my info, then called back two minutes later to say flatly that they would not be doing anything. I did feel a little guilty asking for help but big companies have insurance and what if it was a kid that got cut? This incident was not my fault, and my finger still feels like there's something in it. Nothing in my order was glass. I can't say I trust corporations much anyway, but yes, Chewy seems to be one of the nicer ones. I just don't feel good about giving them my money anymore, what can I say?\n\nThank you very much to the MANY more people here who have been so kind and helpful.

It sucks! \n\nI am not trying to change your mind on finding a new supplier, I imagine that even Chewy would prefer you do so as they probably see you as a liability to them.  But I am surprised that it isn't incredibly obvious to you and everyone why Chewy wouldn't do anything for you. \n\nChewy could not give you so much as a coupon because in a legal situation a lawyer would absolutely try to argue that their doing so was an admittance of guilt.  The fact that you called a lawyer is proof that they were right to not give you anything. There is no likely way to prove where the glass came from or even if that is where your cut came from; pictures wouldn't be enough. It could, for example, be argued that you could have cut yourself on a tool you used to open the package or on other broken glass in your home. Even if under the label, glass could've worked its way there in shipping and also packages often have to be re-labeled during shipping. If you'd have injured yourself in an actual store, there are security cameras and witnesses and such that would make fault much easier to prove. Chewy would have to be incredibly foolish to take any accountability for something that can't likely be proven. Just as it is your responsibility to look out for your best interests, it is their responsibility to look out for their best interests.

There was a breach in the security, and they are only able to send through sales through chewys website without confirming anything through PayPal or credit/debit card information. Chewys website isn’t safe. \n\nIf you are super worried, cancel your card you had on there for payment and have them issue another. I changed my PayPal information, but I also had third party identification so if order anything it should have confirmed it was me by sending me a text with a password, which it didn’t. \n\nHonestly if I could get rid of PayPal I would. I hate it as I have been a customer for nearly 20 years, and I have only had maybe a handful of things happen where I needed them to back me up, two of them being this year, and twice they denied any fraud and I had to get my bank involved. \n\nJust make sure you keep an eye on your credit score.

Takes 60 seconds.\n\nChewy, on the other hand, makes you email a generic customer service account. I said I wanted to return XYZ items from this order #. I get another paragraph-long email back from Chewy, asking if I can be more specific. They want me to go into [Chewy.com](https://Chewy.com), copy and paste all the individual names and then send it back in a different email client, just to start a return.\n\nGlad people like them as a platform, but for a company that prides itself on \"customer service,\" this is really user-hostile.

It's not as convenient because sometimes it's hard for me to find certain items that I would order from them, but they won't get another dime from me.\n\n## Comment ID kr1vhlp with +11 score by [(East_Blueberry_1892, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/1au0oa3/chewycom_returns_shocked_by_the_love_people_have/kr1vhlp/) (in reply to ID 1au0oa3):\nEvery time I wanted to return something to Chewy.com, they always told me to donate it or keep it, refunded my money and sent me a replacement/different item, with no fuss.\n\n## Comment ID kr11lz6 with +15 score by [(Comfortable_Candy649, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/1au0oa3/chewycom_returns_shocked_by_the_love_people_have/kr11lz6/) (in reply to ID 1au0oa3):\nIf it was automated they’d have people complaining that they cannot speak to a real human because the return has xyz complication. \n\nCompanies cannot win these days.\n\n## Comment ID kr1j2ef with +8 score by [(lexlexsquared, Reddit, 2024-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/1au0oa3/chewycom_returns_shocked_by_the_love_people_have/kr1j2ef/) (in reply to ID 1au0oa3):\nYeah next time just call— it took me 2mins!

I bought a bunch of toys from chewy and a few cat beds, they had a sale going, and I wanted to treat/update things for my fur babies. I have NEVER had fleas in the house until these ordered items arrived.\n\nAll my cats ended up with fleas, and it has been hell. The vacuuming, washing, expensive flea meds, all of it has been awful. I went onto the chewy website, only to look at the more recent reviews of the cat toys/beds that I bought, to see numerous other people complaining of getting fleas from chewy products.\n\nSo, while their ease of returns might be wonderful, the people returning the items are probably not being honest with the product they’re returning. Letting their pet play with it for weeks, or sleeping in it and then returning it when they no longer use it. Chewy obviously isn’t sanitizing or de-fleaing their items either.\n\n## Comment ID kyiundx with +1 score by [(baby_Billys_purr, Reddit, 2024-04-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/1au0oa3/chewycom_returns_shocked_by_the_love_people_have/kyiundx/) (in reply to ID 1au0oa3):\nReally love them.

I've never returned anything to Chewy before, and I guess I thought it would be as easy as it is on Amazon. I ordered a pet food storage container that arrived broken. Since I could also see that the container was going to be really too big for our needs, a return was the only way forward. I was really surprised when I went to the website and had to go to FAQs to find anything about returns. Then I have to follow a link that leads me to a series of drop-down menus that finally leads to a \"general inquiry\" -- never a mention of returns. Yes, someone got back to me quickly via email. But she just apologized for the broken item, told me I could keep it, and told me she'd already put in an order for a replacement! Very pro-active of her, but I don't want a replacement! So I had to email her back and am now waiting for that response. In the meantime, I just got an email from them thanking me for donating my unwanted item to a local shelter. Why would I donate a broken storage container to my local shelter? Don't they have enough problems? This whole system is clearly designed to make you give up and go away.

      "# Post ID ggdkrq: I'm a Vet. Here's why I hate Chewy. [discussion] with +3144 score by [(PrinceofPersians, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/)\nNo, it's not the revenue loss.  Pretty much every vet who's not on the brink of retirement age has accepted the loss of the in-clinic pharmacy as an inevitability.  This post also isn't about online pharmacies in general.  I don't necessarily *like* Walmart, or 1-800-PETMEDS, or Allivet.  However, I *hate* Chewy.\n\nMy problem is the dishonesty.  You ever get one of those emails or calls where they say your vet hasn't approved the prescription?  Our clients sure did too.  In fact, Chewy accidentally sent us an email recently that was meant for clients:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Dear Pet Parent,  \n>  \n>Chewy is committed to your pet's health and happiness. Challenging times like these will never change that.  \n>  \n>We are actively working to contact your veterinarian to get your pet’s prescription approved, so we can deliver your pet’s essential medicine as fast as possible. Unfortunately, we haven't been able to get through as of yet.  \n>  \n>These are unprecedented times and it may be possible that your vet is extra busy or working reduced hours. If you’d like to help, you can also contact your veterinarian’s office to find out where they are with approvals.  \n>  \n>Your pet's well-being will always be our top priority and we’re doing everything we can to make sure your order goes through.  \n>  \n>We appreciate your support. Stay well and find moments of comfort with your pet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"We're working oh so hard on getting the prescription to you, if only your vet would approve it!\"\n\nWhat we found from several of our clients: on numerous occasions (or perhaps all), they were sending this email out the *second* they actually sent the email requesting approval from your vet.  Our clinic always printed out and took care of all approvals by noon the day the prescription requests came in.   Yet, we had always dealt with clients angry about how we weren't approving their scripts.  We would have to send approvals multiple times.  In fact we eventually had to disconnect our fax simply because sending Chewy scripts 3-4 times for each request clogged a free phone line and took up a lot of time.   Chewy tended to be the most egregious of the companies to do this.\n\nSo instead we stuck with emails which have convenient time stamps...and the ability to bcc them to the client :)\n\nSuddenly, when we started sending these emails to the client with a time stamp from both Chewy's email and our approval, they were calling Chewy instead of us to complain, yelling at customer service when they tried to call the client and claim we weren't approving it, or ditching Chewy altogether.  We got to see both sides ourselves too.  On one fun occasion, we didn't have a medication that our tech needed for her dog but could only order a 1000 count bottle, so she ordered from Chewy.  They didn't respond for about 5 days, then sent the first and only email approval to us at 5pm on a Saturday and then the email to our technician that they were unable to reach us after three attempts at about 7am the following morning.\n\nThen the demands came from Chewy for either verbal approval (no paper trail, and no accountability for them), or fax (a paper trail but difficult to send/prove to client, so in most cases, still no accountability for them).  On one occasion we denied both and told them via phone to email three times over the span of an hour, admittedly with some rudeness on the third, and they proceeded to try to send a fax through our phone line consecutively for 35 minutes straight.  I was doing an emergency surgery on a dog with a wound with a bad bleeder from the linguofacial vein while this was happening.  Needless to say, it was hard to concentrate on saving the patient but we couldn't disconnect the phone line in case another urgent call needed to be answered.  The dog did fine (for anyone worrying about this) :).\n\nAll of the dishonesty with the timing of approvals have been worse recently.  I suspect related to difficulty with supply in the COVID-19 crisis.  It's been tough for us too, and we've been honest with clients about this.  So with Chewy, I suspect that instead of saying \"we're having shipping delays\" or \"we're on backorder for that very common thing\", they're simply claiming the vet isn't responding while they deal with delayed arrivals/shipments.\n\nSo now they've stopped doing emails altogether.  They can do fax or verbal approval (again, no accountability), or a new option.  They have an online platform called Petscriptions (again from what their own customer service implied, communication on the timing of prescriptions had no accountability for them, they can say whatever they want).  Furthermore, with yours and our data becoming a more valuable resource, I don't want to make the data mining that every online company does even easier for them.\n\nI'm not writing this for the revenue.  You've all heard the \"shop local\" argument so many times I'd be beating a dead horse by saying it.  Money is tight, especially now.  And if you wanted to order online to save some money, I encourage you to do so.  I'm writing this because Chewy has peddled the idea that they genuinely *care* about your pets, through those occasional oil paintings from someone you and your dog have never met, to the kindhearted condolence texts that, when you read them with an objective eye, seem suspiciously formulaic, to the \"customer is always right\" level of pandering that you and I both know is harmful.  However, the stuff I described above is how they behave when dealing with a vital step in getting your pet the medication they need.  Given that this is one of those steps that you can't see, I think it's telling of how much they *actually* care about your pet.\n\nIt shouldn't need to be said that a corporation doesn't care about you or your fur-buddy, but here it is.  I only say this because there *are* people who care about your pet: you, your family, your neighbors (well, sometimes).   And yes, also your doggy daycare workers, your groomers, every worker at your vets office.  If we didn't care about your pet, we wouldn't have accepted far less money for the same work that human equivalents would make in all aspects.  So please, reserve your trust for the people who have actually tried to earn it, and don't let a group of people you've never met put a wedge between you.\n\nPeace, love, wags, and purrs,\n\nA pissed-off dogtor\n\ntl;dr: Chewy is a dishonest trainwreck that doesn't care about you or your pet any more than the other corporate online pharmacies (perhaps even less).\n\nEDIT: I'm sorry about not replying so long.  I work half days on Saturday and didn't feel right messing around on Reddit on shift.  A few things to add or discuss since I probably won't be able to reply to everything.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*FIRST AND FOREMOST\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*:  I got a message from a previous Chewy employee who will remain anonymous due to what you can see in the post:\n\n>Hey there! I worked for said company mentioned earlier (signed a kind of NDA) and I want you to know that you're right. I worked in customer service for almost a year before moving up, and I have to say that the company is BS. There was no communication between locations, and the longer we went on, the more people straight up ignored any communication without getting reprimanded.  \n>  \n>I hated working with vets, although I'm studying to be one, and I felt like crap after getting off the phone. Sometimes there would be a case floating around for a week, and no one cared to look at the \"email only\" notes or \"please call after faxing\"... It was embarrassing.  \n>  \n>I worked in the QA department for a while, but left after they refused to give me a raise, although I was the only person in the department with a degree and the knowledge of small animals,. exotics, and farm to keep the department going. No regrets. Terrible place for a person with an IQ over 35.  \n>  \n>Please don't share my name 😊\n\nI really appreciated that and just want to say that if this user stuck through all that (including some angry vets and techs and receptionists which I can sometimes be myself) then they've got the kind of tough our profession needs now more than ever :)\n\nSECOND:  Some people have brought up that their vet recommends Chewy or that their vet says they've never had a problem with them.  This may be true.  I do not know how the company works.  Perhaps its regional, perhaps its random.  But given that there is an employee here saying otherwise and numerous people in veterinary and human medicine confirming that this is a shared experience, I think it's safe to say that this is a widespread problem.  Furthermore, one should keep in mind that Chewy is owned by Petsmart, and Petsmart is in a partnership with Banfield.  I should also say that I don't know the status but I remember a previous attempt of a Banfield merger with Blue Pearl and VCA.  So the point here is that I wouldn't be surprised if some vets aren't allowed to bash Chewy or perhaps get financial incentive to send clients there specifically.   Or perhaps Chewy simply does better dealing with the clinics under their own umbrella.  Or it's nothing but coincidence, I'm a vet not a psychic.\n\nTHIRD: Yes, they have great customer service when speaking with you.  The point of this post is to discuss what happens to people who aren't the client and what happens to your prescriptions--that your pet needs--behind the scenes.\n\nI'll edit more as needed or try to respond better to comments individually but there are a lot more than I anticipated o\\_O\n\nBasically, just be wary of any company where you'll never be able to chat with the boss (and also be wary of that boss if you can chat with them).  For example, I hear Jeff Bezos is building an actual giant clock that's totally not a doomsday device in the middle of his desert mountain.  Anyways, please be safe, keep 6 feet distance from any of those gross \"other people\", and stay fuzzy, soldiers.\n\nEdit 2: I spelled bad :(\n\nEdit 3: We've got another employee.  Thank you very much  PoodlePopXX\n\n>As some one who worked for Chewy, they are an actual trash company. They treat their employee like garbage and they run unsafe warehouses. Everything and everyone is a number to them no matter who hard you work. Their attendance policy is a joke and is meant to push people out as quickly as they come in.  \n>  \n>Just one example, one night an industrial lithium battery exploded and caught fire. A good portion of the warehouse filled with dark black smoke that smelled terrible. People passed out, others couldn’t breath, and they didn’t want to open the doors or let people go outside and stop working for fresh air. The entire warehouse needed to keep working. People had headaches all night. Three people ended up hospitalized. They had to call ambulances. If you felt awful from the smoke inhalation and air quality you could choose to go home, but you’d have to take attendance points against your record. That’s the kind of company they are.  \n>  \n>I ordered from there often before I worked there. After I worked there I wouldn’t order from there if it was free.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Comment ID fq09ei4 with +517 score by [(endersendgame, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq09ei4/) (in reply to ID ggdkrq):\nAs someone who worked as a vet receptionist for 2.5 years I can say this is 100% true!

I got into our system where we scan in and time stamp the approvals and could tell him that we had only received 2 and sent them back on such and such date and such and such time. He calmed down with me and than called chewy and yelled at them haha\n\n#### Comment ID fq0nx8k with +102 score by [(hitzchicky, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq0nx8k/) (in reply to ID fq0dayl):\nI'll never understand why people start a conversation with yelling.

Chewy and others have had issues with counterfeit product.\n\nChewy is known for fantastic customer service and that’s awesome!  However, please understand that vets have an ENTIRELY different experience with them.  We do not mind helping you get product at a lower cost because our primary goal is to keep your pets healthy!  I much rather your pet not get Lyme disease than sell you flea and tick product.\n\nJust know, it costs us time, money and frustration to have to deal with these pharmacies who are frequently hostile toward us.  It is a love/hate relationship.\n\nWe have to divert man power to lose money to pharmacies which is okay if it helps our patients. Fulfilling one script can take our techs up to 15 minutes as techs have to find the chart, ensure the medication is acceptable by checking the medical history, contact the owners (who usually don’t answer) to triple check that they have been on it for things such as heartworm, and then chase down a doctor to sign (usually with a patient). Once the vet has it, we have to review everything from medical history to dosage, and sign off.  Then it goes back to the tech who must send it off.  This occurs all while both the tech and doctor are seeing patients, performing surgeries, reviewing cases and performing our other job duties.  We do about 35 of these a day.  But I repeat, we will do it as long as you keep your pets on the medications they need!\n\nAlso, majority of us are not trying to rip you off.  Our prices are higher because we stock lesser quantities!  Always ask about rebates!\n\nOh god, this turned into a rant.  Sorry.\n\n### Comment ID fq133a1 with +5 score by [(codenameblackmamba, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq133a1/) (in reply to ID fq0khui):\nGreat tip about the rebates - my dog’s medication is 2x more expensive through the vet’s pharmacy compared to online suppliers, but all the online suppliers have been out of stock for a few months so we’ve had no choice.

I most certainly don't think my smaller vet clinic didn't approve it, they probably didn't see it yet or, perhaps they only approve things a certain time every day, so it can take longer then expected.  If I have an emergency type script, I'm not using chewy, as you can never get a large company to move their ass in matters that only are important to you. But you'll always have a better response from your vet. Even if I have to call my vet later, I'm assuming something was missed (on either side) and now that they're expecting it, after I call chewy, it should be fine. Of course, I worked in a Drs office for about 5 years, many years ago, so maybe that's why I'm not freaking out about these things.  Honestly, I expect to have these issues with Any company I might use for my pet's rx, as the company is only as good as the underpaid person requesting the approval. I also feel clear communication from the vet or staff can change the dialogue here.  Something like \"We'll get to the bottom of this, but I do want to let you know we've been having some problems with Chewy saying they did things that they didn't\".  It's not like you have to protect Chewy when they mess up.  I really hope you do tell your clients about these issues each time.  Chewy asks for feedback all the time, and if people were aware and reported these issues it's possible Chewy might get their head out of their ass.\n\n### Comment ID fq0wj5h with +6 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq0wj5h/) (in reply to ID fq0pxxg):\nI'm the same tbh.

They recommended trying 1-800 PET MEDS or Chewy as an option, so I went with Chewy since we already got kitty litter through them. \n\nCouple of things that went through my mind:\n\n1. I wish the vet office had told us they were no longer carrying the med BEFORE we were about to run out. Luckily with COVID, I was trying to stay a week ahead of things but normally I’d wait till a day before they’d run out. (This is more of a personal complaint than a Chewy complaint). But, I ordered ASAP and there was no lapse in medicine for the pup. \n\n2. I’d heard this about Chewy from friends who are vets. Also that the drugs aren’t “guaranteed” like they are at a vet’s office. That’s not the best word, but the best my brain could come up with. If the medicine doesn’t work/makes your pet sick,/etc., Chewy can’t/won’t do anything to right the wrong, whereas your vets office might. \n\n3. I went with Chewy because of ease, I already had an account with them. But I can change if it’s not the best option.\n\nVet workers of the world, knowing my vet’s office simply doesn’t carry the med anymore- would you recommend I reorder through 1-800 PET MEDS over Chewy?

They get an insane bulk discount. Vets don’t always carry the massive size bags because they will expire before they can sell them. If you ask reception at your vet office to special order you a specific size of food they 100% will. If it’s not a size they normally carry you can ask the office manger how much it would be before you place the order since they probably haven’t done the math on the price vs order price yet. \nThey just need a heads up cause every vet I’ve ever worked for has to place one big order at a time to get the free shipping so they wait until they have a order together.  \n\nAlso for pet parents starting a new prescription food a lot of people like to buy the small bags Incase the animal hates it. Also vets will fully 100% refund the price of the bag of food if you cat or dog refuses it. We can return the open bag of food to manufacture and get refunded. Win/win. Half the companies require us to send the food back the other half of companies don’t and we usually give those open bags of food away to clients who literally can’t afford anything.

Thanks for taking the time to share it. \n\nI have a great relationship with our vet—we’ve used them for over twenty years, through four dogs, three cats, a turtle and a snake; two dogs, two cats and turtle currently. Just a few years ago our oldest dog got a terrible infection that required several expensive meds and when the doc brought the ‘scrip out he said flat out to me that I could get it cheaper at the Walgreens down the street. I asked him what numbers we’re talking about and it was hundreds. \n\nThat kind of behavior between vets and patients builds trust and is one of the reasons I’ve been with my vets for over two decades. There’s also the great care and friendly staff. \n\nAnyway, what kind of chronic illnesses are animals dealing with that multiple animal pharmaceutical companies are required? Or are pets being over medicated? I’ve had nine animals over the past ~30 years, I get some animals have chronic conditions. What we’ve needed for our animals was reasonably priced at our vet or we found it at regular drugstores at a cheaper price. I also know my vet practice’s philosophy is low key and they have advised against medications for my animals—kitty Prozac for a particularly odd cat we have now. Understandably, that’s not a lot of evidence from which to extrapolate a cogent opinion on the issue, I just don’t get that kind of market for medications for pets.\n\n### Comment ID fq0bxhu with +12 score by [(Emulocks, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq0bxhu/) (in reply to ID fq060to):\nAccording to this website:\n https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-pet-statistics\n\nthere are almost 103 million cats and dogs owned as pets in the US.

Either they are bombarding us with several copies of the same request, or they are calling to complain that they haven't gotten anything from us, or they are bullying owners into peppering us with calls.

They treat their employee like garbage and they run unsafe warehouses. Everything and everyone is a number to them no matter who hard you work. Their attendance policy is a joke and is meant to push people out as quickly as they come in. \n\nJust one example, one night an industrial lithium battery exploded and caught fire. A good portion of the warehouse filled with dark black smoke that smelled terrible. People passed out, others couldn’t breath, and they didn’t want to open the doors or let people go outside and stop working for fresh air. The entire warehouse needed to keep working. People had headaches all night. Three people ended up hospitalized. They had to call ambulances. If you felt awful from the smoke inhalation and air quality you could choose to go home, but you’d have to take attendance points against your record. That’s the kind of company they are.\n\nI ordered from there often before I worked there.

I used to be a vet tech, and Chewy were okay about prescriptions, I think, but I never dealt with that side of it in the office, so I'm not sure. Even though I no longer work with my former employer, I still always get my pets' pain meds, flea and tick medicine, heartworm prevention, etc. from my vet of 20+ years, so I haven't had to deal with Chewy on the pharmacy front. But with just regular packages...even before coronavirus and not ordering near holidays, they were *always* late coming to my door. This is even with me ordering over $50 on stuff, which is supposed to mean I would get 2-day shipping. Instead, I would get packages a week or so later. I wouldn't have been so upset if they didn't have *huge* banners all over their website that said free 2-day shipping for orders over $50 lmao whenever I ordered stuff below $50, it would take even longer.\n\nNeedless to say, I no longer shop with them. I got tired of emailing them to ask where my stuff was, especially if it was time-sensitive (not prescription meds, but things like dog food because I was running low and only had maybe 3 days left, or even cosequin tablets that needs to be taken every day to remain effective -- my dogs not having any for 4+ days resulted in pain for my poor seniors). Keep in mind that I'm also disabled, so my packages being late could *really* fuck things up, since I can't just hop in the car and go to a physical store to get the things I needed.\n\n## Comment ID fq0g1br with +6 score by [(ningirl42, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq0g1br/) (in reply to ID ggdkrq):\nThank you for this information.

I’ve had trouble with Chewy from the get go just for fricking dog toys and the order being delayed for weeks.... and long before the current slow shipping pandemic situation.  My sister lives two hours south of me and she’s been a Chewy customer for a long time but recently gave up on them.  I’ve never gotten scripts for my critters from Chewy, Allivet is just a stone’s throw away so shipping has always been quite fast and they’re very good about getting approval WHEN their online selection of vets included our new doctor that is (had an issue with vet “not approving” the prescription....I sent an angry text to our vet but as it turns out, it was Allivet’s mistake because they’re system “reverted” to our former vet, who recently retired.  But we got it all straightened out and since (and long before) this situation, they’ve always done a great job.  I’ve never gotten vet meds from Walmart or any walk in pharmacy with the one exception of an eye “moisturizer” for my elderly basset hound, and the Walgreens pharmacist was kind enough to recommend an equally good but less expensive option.\n\nThat said, idk what’s been going on with Chewy but after my first experience I’ve been reluctant to ever order from them again, even like I said, for dog toys and an orthopedic pet bed....\n\nI know vets must be run off their feet right now and mine recently came to the house (but examined my pups in the garage, not inside) and I couldn’t believe she was kind enough to do this given the current social isolation scenario.  But I’m disabled and it’s very difficult to get 3 dogs in and out of the car (the largest of whom is 100+ pounds and has a deformed foot so jumping up is very painful) so her home visit was more appreciated than she’ll ever know.  I consider vets on the front line because even in quarantine, life for our critters goes on and they must be tended to like always....\n\nSo from the bottom of my heart, thank you for continuing to do your thing.....I for one (and I’m most definitely NOT alone) am forever grateful.\n\n### Comment ID fq33cwv with +1 score by [(PrinceofPersians, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq33cwv/) (in reply to ID fq31t94):\nThank you so much, that means a lot to us in general.

The only time I got the message was last month when I ordered food and they were upfront from the start that it would take a lot longer than usual and even gave me the option to cancel the order, 24 hours after it was placed, and no hoops to jump through. I’ve asked to return a bed that was too big for my dog and they said to donate it, which was great since I volunteer at a shelter and also foster. They even sent my dog a hand written birthday card. These things are trivial in the grand scheme of things but for people thinking this is the normal and plan to never use Chewy, just have your own experience before you decide. If my vet can figure out how to autoship her meds in 2 days for a pretty big discounted price without me ever having to make a single phone call, then I’ll consider buying from them instead.\n\n## Comment ID fq0hakr with +4 score by [(wellfuckmylife666, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq0hakr/) (in reply to ID ggdkrq):\nLol I seriously don't trust corporations and I don't think anyone should.\n\n## Comment ID fq02sjz with +6 score by [(BetsMomE, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq02sjz/) (in reply to ID ggdkrq):\nThank you for sharing this.

As someone with stable finances who (normally) shops online somewhat frequently there is just no reason for my card to ever decline. Every time I go to Chewy’s site to manually get them to run it again, I don’t have to provide any additional information and it will immediately work. I have been surprised by how illogical it is for them to not just try to run the card again if there’s a processing issue/problem connecting with the bank. Reading this has admittedly made me somewhat suspicious that this is a tactic to delay order processing. \n\nTo be honest it won’t impact my use of the service for the time being - before we were unable to pick up prescription food from our dog’s dermatologist because of our hours v. theirs, and now because our local government has asked us to avoid going anywhere we have to drive + we’re minimizing contact with people. We may have to look into whether another site carries our dogs’ prescriptions though.

We’d risk being in trouble part way through the year if she has an accident and there’s not enough left in the pot. \n\nIf vets were charging something more reasonable I’d go back in a heartbeat.\n\n### Comment ID fq25qj3 with +2 score by [(PrinceofPersians, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq25qj3/) (in reply to ID fq0qcdx):\nI can tell you that part of this is related to cost to acquire the meds.  I do know for a fact that corporate clinics such as VCA can get medications at less than half the cost that I can simply by working out deals with the companies to buy in bulk for x-amount of time.

I worked there for 2.5 years in their main customer service location as a customer service representative.\n\nYou are absolutely right, the RX team is awful. As a rep, we all hated having to assist that team, and when they launched their pharmacy with actual meds instead of just prescription food, it was a literal shit-show. A lot of departments at Chewy are run by younger people with little experience, with most management being between 20 and 30. [I'm in this bracket, so I'm not saying this was a bad thing, just maybe needed a few seaaoned managers]\n\nThe approval process is so stupid. Customer places order, order gets sent to RX, RX automatically sends a fax (if there's a fax number on file) to the vet. Then it sits in a queue until a person gets to it to make the phone calls to the vet's office. Any emails sent are usually automatic based on time. There used to be email options for the vet diet foods, but with medication, legally it's not valid. The RX team was so small when I was there, and when an angry customer calls in, we would have to reach out to that team to inquire about the status of their order. We as reps couldn't get the approval ourselves (unless it was food) so we couldn't even call the vet for the customer.\n\nIf you ordered on a weekend? Forget it, you'll get a bunch of emails becuase most vets are closed.\n\nChewy was amazing when I started. Then Petsmart bought it, and the 2 guys that created Chewy and their original team got quietly pushed out one by one. I should have left when they did.\n\nI'm sorry for anyone who has had a bad experience with Chewy. I miss how it was, when my days were spent helping happy people and talking about their pets, instead of having to apologize for FedEx and Lasership.\n\n## Comment ID fq0tmj9 with +2 score by [(tabby51260, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq0tmj9/) (in reply to ID ggdkrq):\nI also hate Chewy - but for an entirely different reason.\n\nThe one and *only* time I've ever gotten a piece of mail from them was within a week of putting my dog down. \n\nFuck Chewy.\n\n### Comment ID fq0w5vw with +3 score by [(asilentmurder, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq0w5vw/) (in reply to ID fq0tmj9):\nDid Chewy know you lost your dog?

My dog is on special prescription food now, and my vet told me to either go through Chewy or a store like PetSmart because they were out of the food at their practice. I went through Chewy for the first order, and it was all approved by them and my vet within a few hours. However, I'm not surprised my vet recommended them since they're a very small practice and they tend to carry a limited supply of medicines and food.\n\nI'm wondering too if Chewy maybe prioritizes certain practices over others? Like, maybe ones they like are given priority and ones they don't are thrown in the \"if we're falling behind, send a notice that the vet is taking forever\" pile.\n\nOne thing I will say -- I don't understand anyone who would jump to calling up their vet angry about an email, fax, etc. miscommunication. It's your pet's doctor and they have their best interests at heart; I would never dream of being anything but polite calling into mine, even if I was frustrated.

We are owned by Mars, as is VCA and Blue Pearl, but we are all independent companies that do not work \"together\". I believe if Petsmart still holds any shares in Banfield, it's relatively minimal and we don't answer to them about anything, other than their hours affecting ours (espcially with this pandemic). \n\nRecords are not shared internally between these three practices, so if one of our clients goes to Blue Pearl, for example, they still have to send us a fax saying one of our clients was there and a copy of the notes (although there is also an online portal where we can access the same documents). \n\nTrust me, we hate dealing with Chewy as much as anyone else. They send 3 requests within a single day, claim they \"didn't get the fax\", and call for verbal confirmations before even giving us a full day to get back to them. Our vets get NO benefits to sending people to Chewy vs any other online pharmacy. In fact, we offer price matching to discourage it. And our vets are very open about the fact that Zoetis, Elanco, etc aren't going to warranty their products from them, but they will if they buy from us, regardless of the price.\n\n## Comment ID fqbqnmd with +1 score by [(idtlkpswds, Reddit, 2020-05-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fqbqnmd/) (in reply to ID ggdkrq):\nMy vet even told us to shop the meds.\n\n## Comment ID fqdqwej with +1 score by [(angelheaded--hipster, Reddit, 2020-05-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fqdqwej/) (in reply to ID ggdkrq):\nAs a senior dog rescuer with a bad back, chewy has saved me.

From what I could see between them and CareCredit Website, the ONLY way your Prescription pet Foods would be covered is if you bought them right from your Vet Office (which usually has a higher price tag).\n\n### Comment ID lop6wqy with +1 score by [(Majestic_Dimension_7, Reddit, 2024-09-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/1ddhbz2/does_anyone_know_how_to_use_carecredit_on_chewycom/lop6wqy/) (in reply to ID l8ss3dp):\nYea i don't understand that. I am reading conflicting answers about whether you can or cannot  buy ANYTHING at Walmart or not. Guess if u have a CareCredit MC u can,  but otherwise not? Plus, I noticed a 79.00 charge on the vet bill when I used the card for my dogs yearly wellness described as \"Young Wellness Select\". And, i think that is because they accept that CC as compared to regular  CC. Always wondered why I can't put them through a regular cc machine. I have to give it directly to the people in the office. But, sometimes I need extra help for my babies so I continue to use them if I don't have the extra cash.\n\n## Comment ID l8sqm7f with +1 score by [(Timely-Ad-8222, Reddit, 2024-06-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/1ddhbz2/does_anyone_know_how_to_use_carecredit_on_chewycom/l8sqm7f/) (in reply to ID 1ddhbz2):\nI am wondering the same thing... if I can use the card at Chewy because then I would use to to purchase my cat's prescription cat food.  If you are getting that Oops... I would suggest contacting chewy support first... maybe there is a system issue on their end so they have to process it manually?

However, I am pretty sure Walmart does not do Prescription pet food processing.\n\n## Comment ID lc3e4c8 with +1 score by [(CarelessJellyfish283, Reddit, 2024-07-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/1ddhbz2/does_anyone_know_how_to_use_carecredit_on_chewycom/lc3e4c8/) (in reply to ID 1ddhbz2):\nI just used the Chewy Live Chat feature, as I was curious about purchasing some prescription flea/tick meds from them, but they do NOT accept Care Credit.

          "cons": "1. (For some) You will have to work. At some companies with 20k+ employees, you can sort of skirt by doing the bare minimum and your lack of effort can hide amongst the volume. At Chewy, you'll get sniffed out pretty quickly. As kind as everyone is, we are also goal-oriented and you can't sit idle here - we move too fast, This is a con for \"big company people\" who want to rest for 10 years before retiring. If you're motivated and focused, you'll love it. If you're not, this will be a major con for you. 2. (For some) There are a lot (and growing) of inspection mechanisms. And while they may add value and be important for scale, document writing is the way decisions are made at Chewy, and it's a big upfront level of effort to present or support an idea. If you enjoy very high autonomy, the ability to move super fast and only 'check in with a PPT slide or two\" at the end of a quarter with a couple fancy graphics that distract from results, Chewy may not be the place for you. In current state, data-driven, crisp, long-format document writing is more than a task, it's HOW we work. For someone who is great at 'doing' but weak at explaining their ideas, and the how/why in written format, or someone who doesn't like to be questioned and inspected continually, it may be stressful. Great place for those who like strong upfront alignment, clear decision-making thought process and ongoing discussions about our effectiveness, but would not recommend for the 'casual, let me do my thing and don't inspect me' type of person.",

          "pros": "1. Everyone actually cares about the customer experience - and not just product teams shipping customer-facing gizmos...on-site facilities teams care about welcome experience for guests, IT cares about the experience of employees submitting request, etc. It's an extremely customer centric organization and it's thoroughly engrained at all levels. 2. Everyone wants to help. Sure, there are busy times when there are bandwidth issues like anywhere else and you might feel like you don't have enough resources, but by intention, everyone is in everyone's corner. This isn't a cutthroat place where your success has to mean someone else's failure - everyone can succeed. 3. People are nice. Crazy thought, right? People are SO nice. Like, everyone. Run into someone in a break room? Friendliest conversation ever. On a call with a C Suite leader, you walk away thinking \"WOW, I wouldn't have assumed they'd be so nice\". It's just a company of really kind people who actually care how you're doing when they ask. 4. You get the OPPORTUNITY to have shifting priorities. Sometimes people complain \"We keep changing priorities.\" To which I say, \"So? Would you rather work for a company that can't switch priorities and instead goes out of business because you didn't adapt to new information and customer demands?\" Your paycheck stays the same if your priority shifts. It's ok. You will have the opportunity to work on many different projects, and while it sometimes seems tiring, it's pretty cool to look back after a year and say \"I got to work on 15 different impactful things \" Chewy has a high \"I get to do a lot\" quotient. 5. Everyone gets a say. This isn't a \"VP+ gets a voice and we all march\" sort of place. Every team member at any level has the opportunity to voice their POV and share an idea, and the great ideas are used. They are involved in bringing it to life, in building on the idea, and even presenting it. I've seen many leaders at Chewy start in entry level positions and soar to senior leader roles in a matter of a few years by having well founded ideas and seeing them through.",

There's zero complaints for me here as an employee. The goals set are very reasonable and we get set breaks (paid and unpaid). We recently even had a family day event where we got to take the workday off fully paid to go and have fun at an indoor race track and arcades place with our families. All i was looking for honestly was just a place where i could have lunch and be able to use the bathroom. But Chewy gave me so much more.",

My advice-- Get Mita out of as president of Chewy Healthcare as she has ZERO knowledge on how to successfully run and manage a veterinary business. It's very political as she is the wife of the CEO, Sumit, so change will not happen because she is protected. Also, she modeled all of the hospitals to have a very 'salon' and 'upscale' appearance. It's a hospital-not a spa, the functionality of the space is laughable if you have experience in practice management at other more established companies.

People actually know when you do this and it's impossible to respect someone who treats colleagues this way. I do not care what your title is.\n\nThe support for maintaining a bullying/mobbing type of environment and gaslighting anyone who tries to speak out is widespread throughout management and HR, all the way to the top at this location, so I don't know what advice I could possibly give to an organization that is clearly structured this way by design. \nStop allowing abuse to flourish in the workplace.\nStop the overt and bizarre favoritism.\nYou have created and are continuing to cultivate an extremely toxic, unhealthy work environment, and it appears to be intentional by the way things are currently handled.\nThis is completely unnecessary, totally avoidable, and sad for a place that could easily be great with some very basic level priorities in place. (or what should be basic level for anyone holding a pharmacist license)\n\nPUT A FIRE ALARM IN THE LAB, so the 20-30 employees who are crammed inside of there can actually know if the building has caught on fire and can safely exit. \nStop telling them that someone will come down from the front to let them know if there is a fire. \nYou should be embarrassed to even say that out loud. If you can't figure out why, please consult a firefighter and a therapist and explain that plan to them.\nStop saying that it's perfectly legal because there are sprinklers.\nProtect your employees.",

This is accomplished through poor, inconsistent communication tactics, withholding information from certain employees, bullying and threatening targeted employees during increasingly required one on one meetings with no witnesses - including aggressive illegal threats and demands about usage of approved FMLA and illegal disclosure of other employee's FMLA status and usage - and ridiculing an employee about alleged performance failures without being able to produce any actual evidence of a deficiency in performance. \nI also was cornered and ridiculed about a health scare that sent me to the hospital, telling me among other things that \"as we get older things will hurt for no reason and you just have to get over it.\" While this was a wildly inappropriate comment and attitude from a supervisor - particularly a pharmacist - it was also potentially illegal since I am over 40 y/o.\nTargeted employees have been publicly scapegoated by management for their own incompetency, as well as for the incompetency and negligence of other pharmacists whom management seems very eager to protect and promote for reasons that remain unclear. \nThe manager allies with and promotes bullies within the lab, strategically pulling strings to create petty, time wasting drama and to set up no-win scenarios which inhibit and erode professional working relationships, and which also allows for easy additional scapegoating of targeted employees. The overall culture maintained in the lab is of a very low standard and any pharmacist who conducts themselves in a reasonably professional manner and actually supervises technician compounding rather than engaging in adolescent level personal relationships with them is ostracized, ignored, and ultimately becomes labeled \"the problem.\"\nThis is a veterinary pharmacy, but you will not find an attitude devoted to the wellbeing of animals among management or very many of the pharmacists. I was told numerous times by a manager that they \"don't even take my cat to the vet,\" like they were bragging about how much they just didn't care. Why does this need to be verbalized at your job, where we are compounding veterinary medication from scratch? \n\nTo summarize: people don't quit jobs, they quit bad bosses",

Where most companies drops PTO (ex: 40 hours will drop to at the beginning of the year and if you've been working for the company for more than a year 80 hours will drop to your account). Here you accumulate PTO and UTO hours 1.54 hours per week, do you know how long it takes to accumulate 40 hours? Almost 26 weeks!!!",

But then again, I guess that's your goal, so you can replace us with your countrymen.

At Chewy, you'll get sniffed out pretty quickly. As kind as everyone is, we are also goal-oriented and you can't sit idle here - we move too fast, This is a con for \"big company people\" who want to rest for 10 years before retiring. If you're motivated and focused, you'll love it. If you're not, this will be a major con for you. 2. (For some) There are a lot (and growing) of inspection mechanisms. And while they may add value and be important for scale, document writing is the way decisions are made at Chewy, and it's a big upfront level of effort to present or support an idea. If you enjoy very high autonomy, the ability to move super fast and only 'check in with a PPT slide or two\" at the end of a quarter with a couple fancy graphics that distract from results, Chewy may not be the place for you. In current state, data-driven, crisp, long-format document writing is more than a task, it's HOW we work. For someone who is great at 'doing' but weak at explaining their ideas, and the how/why in written format, or someone who doesn't like to be questioned and inspected continually, it may be stressful. Great place for those who like strong upfront alignment, clear decision-making thought process and ongoing discussions about our effectiveness, but would not recommend for the 'casual, let me do my thing and don't inspect me' type of person.",

        "pros": "1. Everyone actually cares about the customer experience - and not just product teams shipping customer-facing gizmos...on-site facilities teams care about welcome experience for guests, IT cares about the experience of employees submitting request, etc. It's an extremely customer centric organization and it's thoroughly engrained at all levels. 2. Everyone wants to help. Sure, there are busy times when there are bandwidth issues like anywhere else and you might feel like you don't have enough resources, but by intention, everyone is in everyone's corner. This isn't a cutthroat place where your success has to mean someone else's failure - everyone can succeed. 3. People are nice. Crazy thought, right? People are SO nice. Like, everyone. Run into someone in a break room? Friendliest conversation ever. On a call with a C Suite leader, you walk away thinking \"WOW, I wouldn't have assumed they'd be so nice\". It's just a company of really kind people who actually care how you're doing when they ask. 4. You get the OPPORTUNITY to have shifting priorities. Sometimes people complain \"We keep changing priorities.\" To which I say, \"So? Would you rather work for a company that can't switch priorities and instead goes out of business because you didn't adapt to new information and customer demands?\" Your paycheck stays the same if your priority shifts. It's ok. You will have the opportunity to work on many different projects, and while it sometimes seems tiring, it's pretty cool to look back after a year and say \"I got to work on 15 different impactful things \" Chewy has a high \"I get to do a lot\" quotient. 5. Everyone gets a say. This isn't a \"VP+ gets a voice and we all march\" sort of place. Every team member at any level has the opportunity to voice their POV and share an idea, and the great ideas are used. They are involved in bringing it to life, in building on the idea, and even presenting it. I've seen many leaders at Chewy start in entry level positions and soar to senior leader roles in a matter of a few years by having well founded ideas and seeing them through.",

But then again, I guess that's your goal, so you can replace us with your countrymen.

My advice-- Get Mita out of as president of Chewy Healthcare as she has ZERO knowledge on how to successfully run and manage a veterinary business. It's very political as she is the wife of the CEO, Sumit, so change will not happen because she is protected. Also, she modeled all of the hospitals to have a very 'salon' and 'upscale' appearance. It's a hospital-not a spa, the functionality of the space is laughable if you have experience in practice management at other more established companies.

People actually know when you do this and it's impossible to respect someone who treats colleagues this way. I do not care what your title is.\n\nThe support for maintaining a bullying/mobbing type of environment and gaslighting anyone who tries to speak out is widespread throughout management and HR, all the way to the top at this location, so I don't know what advice I could possibly give to an organization that is clearly structured this way by design. \nStop allowing abuse to flourish in the workplace.\nStop the overt and bizarre favoritism.\nYou have created and are continuing to cultivate an extremely toxic, unhealthy work environment, and it appears to be intentional by the way things are currently handled.\nThis is completely unnecessary, totally avoidable, and sad for a place that could easily be great with some very basic level priorities in place. (or what should be basic level for anyone holding a pharmacist license)\n\nPUT A FIRE ALARM IN THE LAB, so the 20-30 employees who are crammed inside of there can actually know if the building has caught on fire and can safely exit. \nStop telling them that someone will come down from the front to let them know if there is a fire. \nYou should be embarrassed to even say that out loud. If you can't figure out why, please consult a firefighter and a therapist and explain that plan to them.\nStop saying that it's perfectly legal because there are sprinklers.\nProtect your employees.",
        "cons": "Management deliberately maintains a frustrating, rushed environment of disarray and confusion in order to manipulate and control. This is accomplished through poor, inconsistent communication tactics, withholding information from certain employees, bullying and threatening targeted employees during increasingly required one on one meetings with no witnesses - including aggressive illegal threats and demands about usage of approved FMLA and illegal disclosure of other employee's FMLA status and usage - and ridiculing an employee about alleged performance failures without being able to produce any actual evidence of a deficiency in performance. \nI also was cornered and ridiculed about a health scare that sent me to the hospital, telling me among other things that \"as we get older things will hurt for no reason and you just have to get over it.\" While this was a wildly inappropriate comment and attitude from a supervisor - particularly a pharmacist - it was also potentially illegal since I am over 40 y/o.\nTargeted employees have been publicly scapegoated by management for their own incompetency, as well as for the incompetency and negligence of other pharmacists whom management seems very eager to protect and promote for reasons that remain unclear. \nThe manager allies with and promotes bullies within the lab, strategically pulling strings to create petty, time wasting drama and to set up no-win scenarios which inhibit and erode professional working relationships, and which also allows for easy additional scapegoating of targeted employees. The overall culture maintained in the lab is of a very low standard and any pharmacist who conducts themselves in a reasonably professional manner and actually supervises technician compounding rather than engaging in adolescent level personal relationships with them is ostracized, ignored, and ultimately becomes labeled \"the problem.\"\nThis is a veterinary pharmacy, but you will not find an attitude devoted to the wellbeing of animals among management or very many of the pharmacists. I was told numerous times by a manager that they \"don't even take my cat to the vet,\" like they were bragging about how much they just didn't care. Why does this need to be verbalized at your job, where we are compounding veterinary medication from scratch? \n\nTo summarize: people don't quit jobs, they quit bad bosses",

      "# [Chewy shares take the meme stock ride as 'Roaring Kitty' trader reveals stake by Rob Wile on 2024-07-01](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/chewy-shares-jump-roaring-kitty-trader-reveals-stake-rcna159726)\nThe stock price of online pet retailer Chewy went for a ride on Monday after one of the internet's most-followed investors revealed that he had bought up shares in the company.\n\nChewy shares initially jumped 11% but have since turned negative, trading down 6% midday Monday.\n\nThe turbulence comes after Keith Gill, the leader of the “meme stock” movement who is better known online by the handle “Roaring Kitty,” revealed he had taken a significant stake in the company.\n\nGill had foreshadowed the Chewy holdings in a post on X last week that was simply a dog emoji.\n\nChewy shares — as well as other stocks in the pet trade — rallied immediately after the post Thursday.\n\nOn Monday, an SEC filing showed Gill had purchased shares worth approximately $245 million, or about 6.6% of the entire company at Friday's closing price. Gill also mocked up his own version of the standard SEC 13G filing form by adding a section stating he was “not a cat.”\n\nGill shot to fame in 2020 after becoming the de facto leader of an online-populist movement to purchase stocks of legacy brick-and-mortar companies like GameStop, AMC and Bed Bath and Beyond, with the stated goal of attempting to turn the companies around. It didn’t quite work — although the movement did successfully create losses for investors who were actively betting against the companies.\n\nBut his trading has also been the subject of scrutiny.\n\nGill now faces a new class-action lawsuit filed in Brooklyn alleging that his most recent trades in GameStop shares amounted to a \"pump and dump\" scheme.\n\nThe plaintiff, Martin Radev, a Nevada resident, representing a class of other GameStop investors, alleges Gill knowingly used his large and influential platform to \"pump\" up the stock price of the company this year by posting online while failing to reveal he had taken up a new position in the company. Gill then successfully sold his shares for a profit, the lawsuit alleges.\n\nThe price of GameStop shares remains higher than before Gill's post but has declined from its peak by about 50%.\n\nThey were down 5% in Monday trading.\n\nIn a twist, GameStop is now run by Ryan Cohen, who also co-founded Chewy. Cohen helped fuel the meme-stock wave after revealing he had taken a large position in GameStop in 2020, several months after Gill first began posting about his position.\n\nCohen is no longer affiliated with Chewy management, and it is not clear whether he and Gill have any relationship. An attorney for Cohen did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe secretary of state of Massachusetts, where Gill resides, is also investigating the GameStop trade.\n\nGill did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "# [Keith \"Roaring Kitty\" Gill buys $245 million stake in Chewy by Khristopher J. Brooks on 2024-07-01](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/roaring-kitty-chewy-stock-meme-investor/)\nKeith Gill, the meme stock investor who sent GameStop shares surging during the pandemic, has taken out a multimillion stake in Chewy.\n\nGill, who goes by the moniker \"Roaring Kitty\" on X and \"DeepF------Value\" on Reddit, bought more than 9 million shares of the online pet supply giant, according to a regulatory filing posted Monday. Based on Chewy's share price Friday, which was $27.24, Gill's purchase means he now has a $245 million stake in the company. Chewy's stock price surged as much as 15% Monday on news of Gill's investment.\n\nChewy didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.\n\nThat investment comes a week after, Gill posted an image of a cartoon dog with no accompanying text on his Roaring Kitty X account. The post gave shares of Chewy, PetMed Express and Petco a temporary jolt.\n\nGill's puppy post came a day after Chewy announced it would spend $500 million to repurchase 17.5 million of its own shares. Companies typically buy back shares to boost their per-share earnings or to increase returns for existing shareholders.\n\nRoaring Kitty has become known for making the markets move simply by posting cryptic images on social media. Last month, after the end of a roughly three-year hiatus from social media, Roaring Kitty once again caused GameStop shares to soar after it posted an image of a sketched man leaning forward in a chair on X. The post was followed by several others, featuring various comeback-themed videos and movie clips with charged music.\n\nGill's online influence was established in 2021, after he rallied hordes of amateur investors online to invest in the struggling video game retailer GameStop, causing shares — which Gill had started buying the previous year — to soar, in what became known as the first meme-stock frenzy.\n\n\"I believed [GameStop] was dramatically undervalued by the market,\" Gill said in testifying before the House Financial Services Committee in 2021. \"The prevailing analysis about GameStop's impending doom was simply wrong.\"\n\nTo be sure, Gill profited after promoting the purchase of GameStop shares, but he also later lost big. In 2021, for example, Gill revealed that he had lost $13 million in a single day when shares of the game retailer retreated.\n\nGill's investments in GameStop eventually became a cornerstone storyline in the 2023 film \"Dumb Money,\" where Gill is portrayed by actor Paul Dano.",

      "# [Chewy Q2 earnings results show app use growing as net sales increase 2.6% by Kevin Williams, Mary Meisenzahl, Bloomberg News on 2024-09-03](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/chewy-quarterly-sales/)\nPet product retailer Chewy Inc. saw earnings bark past expectations in Q2. The company reported a 2.6% rise in net sales of $2.86 billion for the period. It also saw its net sales per active customer rise 6% from last year, the company reported.\n\n“Chewy’s compelling value proposition is driving broader and deeper customer engagement, as reflected by our 20 million active customers, which grew sequentially in the quarter, and net sales per active customer of $565, which reached a new record for the company,” said Chewy CEO Sumit Singh in the earnings announcement.\n\nChewy is No. 12 in the Top 1000, which is Digital Commerce 360’s database ranking North America’s largest online retailers by their annual web sales. In the Top 1000, Digital Commerce 360 categorizes Chewy as a Specialty retailer. Digital Commerce 360 projects that Chewy online sales will reach $11.59 billion in 2024.\n\nChewy web sales by year\n\nChewy Q2 earnings highlights\n\n“We delivered top-line growth at the high end of our guidance range, continued significant adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, and compelling free cash flow generation,” Singh noted.\n\nOther takeaways from Chewy’s Q2 earnings release include:\n\nNet income: $299.1 million (up from $280.2 million in Q2 2023)\n\nAdjusted EBITDA: $144.8 million. That’s a $56.7 million increase year over year.\n\nAdjusted net income: $104.8 million, an increase of $40.2 million year over year\n\nIn addition, Chewy’s profit margin was up 11% (up from 0.7% in Q2 2023). The increase in margin was primarily driven by lower expenses, company leaders said.\n\nChewy Vet Care grows\n\nChewy has expanded its brand into animal care by opening Chewy Vet Clinics across the country. Two more clinics — one in Denver, the other in South Florida — opened during Q2. There are six Chewy Vet Clinics open now with plans for a couple more by year’s end. Singh described the synergy between the clinics and Chewy products.\n\n“The leading indicators are promising,” he said during the company’s earnings call. “First, Chewy Vet Care is serving as an acquisition funnel, with the proportion of net new customers acquired through our clinics exceeding our expectation.”\n\nHe said he believes that success is leading to stronger customer relationships.\n\n“Many customers are deepening their commitment to the Chewy ecosystem by purchasing pharmacy or food for the first time,” he added.\n\nChewy’s app use rises\n\nChewy customers are increasingly using the company’s app to drive sales, Singh said.\n\n“Unique customers who placed orders through our app increased by approximately 13% year over year, with overall mobile app orders increasing approximately 15% year over year,” Singh said.\n\nHe noted that Chewy observed both higher units per order and better retention when customers download and use the Chewy app. The app counts 20 million active customers, he said.\n\nChewy and Bark Inc. Collaborate\n\nNot mentioned in the earnings call was another recent addition from the world of pet supplies retail. Bark Inc. launched a collection of its best-selling toys on Chewy, marking the first time Chewy will carry Bark products. The initial launch includes popular items like Grey Bear Hugger and Steve Squeaky Plush Snake. The company plans to expand its offerings on Chewy in the coming months, including toys, consumables, and its dental line, Bark Bright.\n\nBark is No. 204 in the Top 1000.\n\nPercentage changes may not align exactly with dollar figures due to rounding.

      "# [Chewy shares stage short-lived rally as filing reveals ‘Roaring Kitty’ takes stake by Guardian staff on 2024-07-01](https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/01/roaring-kitty-keith-gill-chewy-stock)\nShares of Chewy rose 15% premarket on Monday, before reversing sharply, after a filing showed Keith Gill, the stock influencer known as “Roaring Kitty”, had picked up a 6.6% stake in the pet products e-retailer.\n\nThe turbulent rally comes days after the investor, known for triggering the meme-stock rally of 2021, posted an uncaptioned picture of a puppy on the social media platform X that briefly sent Chewy shares to a near one-year high on Thursday.\n\nChewy reversed all its gains and entered the red shortly after the New York Stock Exchange opened on Monday. It finished the day down 6.6%.\n\nThe filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which lists Gill as the reporting person, included a section “Check the appropriate box to designate whether you are a cat” under which the descriptor “I am not a cat” was checked.\n\nThe SEC, Chewy and Gill did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe filing showed that Gill owns 9m shares of Chewy, equating to a stake worth about $245m at the stock’s Friday closing price of $27.24. The stake would make Gill Chewy’s third-largest shareholder, according to LSEG data.\n\nMeme stocks – boosted by memes on social media – first e​merged as a force three years ago, when amateur traders mobilized on platforms including Reddit to boost shares in GameStop.\n\nTheir bids triggered an extraordinary, but fleeting, increase in GameStop’s stock market value. It also left hedge funds that had bet against the company nursing heavy losses.\n\nGill, who led an army of retail investors backing GameStop, is known for his posts on Reddit – where he is known as “DeepFuckingValue” – and YouTube. While silent on the platforms for years after 2021’s frenzy, he has re-emerged in recent months.\n\nShares of Chewy, which sells pet food as well as medicine online, have risen 15% so far in 2024 but declined in the three preceding years as spending on pets slowed after a post-pandemic boom.\n\nIts sales have been stable in the past few quarters despite weaker consumer spending on discretionary items. “Pet humanization” is a key part of Chewy’s strategy, in which owners splurge on pets as they are considered a part of the family.\n\nSome analysts said last week that Gill’s interest in Chewy could also be influenced by the fact that the pet retailer was founded by GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen.",
      "# [Chewy posts 3.1% sales gain in Q1, announces $500M share repurchase program by Caroline Jansen on 2024-05-29](https://www.retaildive.com/news/chewy-sales-gains-share-repurchase-program/717372/)\nDive Brief:\n\nChewy on Wednesday reported first-quarter net sales increased 3.1% year over year to $2.9 billion, beating both its own and analysts’ guidance for the period. Gross margin increased 130 basis points to 29.7%.\n\nThe online pet retailer posted an operating profit of $64.6 million, or a 161% year-over-year increase, and a net income of $66.9 million, or a 193% increase from last year.\n\nChewy on Wednesday also announced a $500 million share repurchase program for its Class A and Class B common stock.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nWhile Chewy continues to post sales gains — unlike many other digitally native retailers in recent months — the online pet retailer’s active customer base is shrinking.\n\nChewy’s active customer base has faced year-over-year declines for the past six quarters. Active customers fell 2.1% from the year-ago period to just under 20 million in Q1, according to a press release. Active customers were nearly flat from the previous quarter, falling 0.5%. The retailer expects active customers to be flat to slightly down in the first half of the year, with some recovery in the second half of the year, executives said on a call with analysts Wednesday.\n\nThe retailer’s net sales per active customer increased 9.6% year over year to $562. The company’s Autoship subscription service also posted gains during the quarter, with sales increasing 6.4% year over year to $2.2 billion, representing 77.6% of net sales.\n\nBut even as consumers cut back on spending in other areas of their lives, the pet category historically has been better positioned to weather economic uncertainty. Further aiding itself, Chewy in recent years has made investments in areas like health and wellness and veterinary clinics. Nondiscretionary consumables and health categories represented 85% of the retailer’s sales last year."
