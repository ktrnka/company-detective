      "# [15 Things To Know About Keeping Hamsters as Pets by Yvonne Villasenor on 2024-09-25](https://be.chewy.com/hamster/)\nFrom their inquisitive nature and sweet personalities to their cuddly appearance, hamsters make excellent pets. And while they can be lower-maintenance compared to dogs or cats, it’s important to provide proper hamster care for a long, healthy life.\n\nIf you’re considering adopting a hamster as a new pet, read on to learn more about these fun little furballs.\n\n1 There are over 20 recognized species of hamsters.\n\nThat’s a lot of hamsters—and all are members of the Cricetidae family. Unlike dogs and cats, whose differences are due to variations in their breed, the visible differences in types of hamsters are because they’re entirely different species, says Tony Rose Adler, co-president of the California Hamster Association in Los Angeles.\n\nWhile most species of hamsters are wild, there are five domesticated hamster species, which are:\n\nSyrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus): You’ve definitely come across these cuties at the pet store. Syrian hamsters, also called Golden hamsters, are the largest and most commonly kept due to their relatively docile personalities, Adler says.\n\nWinter White Dwarf hamsters (Phodopus sungorus): A small hamster whose coat turns white in winter (hence the name).\n\nCampbell’s Dwarf hamsters (Phodopus campbelli): Also known as Djungarian hamsters and Russian dwarfs, Campbell’s dwarf hamsters are social and active, making them fun pets to watch.\n\nChinese hamsters (Cricetulus griseus or Cricetulus barabensis griseus): These unique hamsters are characterized by their slightly longer tail.\n\nRoborovski Dwarf hamsters (Phodopus roborovskii): This is the fastest and smallest of the hamster species, Adler says, and is therefore less suited to handling.\n\n2 Hamsters are crepuscular.\n\nIt’s a common myth that hamsters are nocturnal, snoozing throughout the day and keeping active on their exercise wheel like a long-distance runner at night. Really, hamsters are crepuscular, meaning they’re awake at dawn and dusk and usually resting during the day and overnight.\n\n3 Wild hamsters and domesticated hamsters have important differences.\n\nAccording to the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), wild hamsters are larger than domesticated hamsters: They can grow up to 14 inches long, while a Syrian hamster can grow to about 7 inches. Additionally, wild hamsters are mostly nocturnal, while pet hamsters are crepuscular.\n\nThere are 15 species of wild hamster living in grasslands, fields, and meadows spanning from western European countries into western Asia. Sadly, the common hamster (Cricetus cricetus) is considered critically endangered.\n\n4 Hamsters have useful—and cute!—cheek pouches.\n\nHave you ever seen a hamster with huge, puffed-out cheeks? They’re able to safely hoard and stuff their faces thanks to their cheek pouches. These cheek pouches are like long cul-de-sacs on the inside of both sides of their mouths, says Courtney Campbell, DVM, DACVS-SA, a small animal specialty surgeon at VetSurg in Ventura, California. They’re essentially invaginations—or long, wide sleeves with a dead end—of the oral mucosa.\n\nDr. Campbell notes that hamsters’ pouches can be used for transporting the following:\n\nFood\n\nBedding\n\nNesting material\n\nTheir young (although this is rare)\n\nAnother fun fact: Hamsters can inflate their cheek pouches to increase buoyancy when they need to swim!\n\nThese pouches extend to the shoulders and are retracted by the cheek muscle, which evolved from their trapezius muscle, Dr. Campbell says. When it’s time to empty their cheek pouches, they simply push the contents forward with their paws. “My hamster, Quaratina, does this every night when she is adjusting her bed,” Dr. Campbell says.\n\n5 A hamster’s front teeth never stop growing.\n\nHamsters’ front teeth, or incisors, continuously grow. This, Adler says, is why hamster-friendly chews are very important to their health. They help keep their front teeth at a healthy length, which helps prevent dental problems and other serious health issues.\n\n6Hamsters prefer to be alone.\n\nThere’s a common misconception that hamsters are social or “need” friends. The truth is, they’d rather be lone wolves—er, hammies.\n\n“All species of hamsters naturally live solitary lives in the wild, and this is the safest choice for them as pets too,” Adler says. “They only need you!”\n\n7They need a habitat with plenty of space.\n\nIf you’re looking for the best habitat for your hammy, Adler suggests looking for a hamster cage that’s secure, large, and provides a basin for deep bedding. In their natural habitat, they burrow and live across territories up to a square mile, she adds.\n\n“While we can’t replicate that in our homes, the recommended minimum cage size for a hamster of any species is 600 square inches,” Adler says. They’ll also need a bar spacing of one-half inch or less to keep them from escaping.\n\nShe says different hamsters do best in different styles of cages:\n\nFor female Syrian hamsters: A tank of 40 gallons or larger, with a screen top and clips, is necessary to keep these notoriously restless hamsters from escaping.\n\nFor Roborovski hamsters: Tanks are also a great option for this species, as their small size makes it easy to escape most other cages.\n\nFor male Syrian hamsters and adult dwarf hamsters: A bar cage, like the Prevue 528 or Ranch cage is great for these types of hamsters. Adler considers these two options to be easy to clean and highly customizable.\n\nPrevue Pet Products Ranch Universal Small Pet House\n\n$99.49\n\nFREE 1-3 day shipping\n\nPrevue Pet Products Deluxe Hamster Home\n\n$92.05\n\nFREE 1-3 day shipping\n\nAivituvin Anti-Chewing Wooden Hamster Cage\n\n$149.99\n\nFREE 1-3 day shipping\n\n8Hamsters are omnivorous and coprophagic.\n\nHamsters eat all kinds of foods, including veggies and meat—and sometimes their own waste. (Yep, that’s what coprophagic means.)\n\nIn the wild, these little omnivores will eat seeds, grains, plants, and some invertebrates. However, domesticated hamsters thrive with pellets supplemented with fruits, vegetables, nuts, and animal protein, and with treats kept to a minimum. Dr. Campbell says it’s important to avoid seed-based diets to prevent obesity and selective feeding. Instead, give commercial pellets to ensure your hammy is getting all the nutrients they need.\n\n9 The right essentials can make a world of difference to your hamster.\n\nAlong with a spacious cage, hamsters need enrichment items in their habitat to keep them happy and healthy. Adler says hamster essentials include:\n\nPaper-based or aspen bedding (for nesting, burrowing, and odor control)\n\nHideouts (for a built-in burrow and a place to nest)\n\nA water bottle or bowl\n\nChews (for healthy teeth)\n\nSand and bowl (for bathing and soaking up excess oils)\n\nHamsters can also benefit from enrichment in the form of treats, an appropriately sized saucer wheel, and bendy bridges.\n\nFrisco Wooden Bridge Small Pet Hideout\n\n$10.17\n\nWare Flying Saucer Small Animal Exercise Wheel\n\n$13.19\n\nNaturals by Rosewood Summer Harvest Small Pet Treats\n\n$9.23\n\nTemporarily out of stock\n\n10 Hamsters can run up to 8 miles a day.\n\nHamsters love to run! So naturally, a proper wheel is important, Adler says.\n\n“The number one tip for pet parents is to ensure the wheel is large enough that their hamster’s back does not arch into a ‘U’ shape while running,” she says. “This indicates the wheel is too small, and running on it will lead to spinal damage, arthritis, and/or obesity if they refuse to run at all.”\n\nWhen looking for a safe, high-quality wheel, she suggests looking for one that’s at least 8 inches wide for dwarf hamsters and at least 12 inches wide for Syrian hamsters. Her recommendation is the Kaytee Comfort Wheel, which comes in both sizes.\n\n11 Syrian hamsters originated nearly 100 years ago.\n\nSyrian hamsters are popular pets. The Syrian hamster (bred in captivity) is said to have originated from a litter of eight hamsters collected near Aleppo, Syria, in 1930, Dr. Campbell says.\n\n12 Hamsters need lots of exercise.\n\nDid you know hamsters’ exercise needs vary across sexes rather than species? “Female hamsters of all species are much more rambunctious and need a plethora of outlets for their energy,” Adler says. “Male hamsters tend to be more relaxed and lazy, but all hamsters still enjoy a good workout on their wheel.”\n\nFor floor time, she recommends using a safe playpen or a bathtub, with the drain plugged and toys added. However, she advises steering clear of hamster balls, despite their popularity.\n\n“Hamsters cannot see very well and rely on their sense of smell to navigate,” she says. “Hamster balls strip them of this ability, which is very stressful. As well, the tiny air slots are perfect for catching little toes and inadvertently breaking ankles.”\n\n13Hamsters generally live up to three years.\n\nThe average lifespan for a hamster can depend on their genetics and husbandry.\n\nDr. Campbell provides a general breakdown on pet rodent lifespans:\n\nHamsters and gerbils: 2–3 years\n\nMice: 1–3 years\n\nRats: 2–4 years\n\nGuinea pigs: 5–7 years\n\nIn rare cases, it’s possible for hamsters to live beyond these estimates. According to Guinness World Records™, the oldest hamster ever was 4.5 years old!\n\n14 Hamsters require different care compared to guinea pigs and gerbils.\n\nWhile hamsters, guinea pigs, and gerbils are all rodents belonging to the Rodentia order, these three animals belong to different families:\n\nHamsters (Cricetidae)\n\nGuinea pigs (Caviidae)\n\nGerbils (Muridae)\n\nThese adorable critters are all considered pocket pets. However, their size as well as their care (e.g., dietary, exercise, and housing) varies from one to another.\n\n15 Hamsters are great pets.\n\n“The most common misconception is that hamsters are not good pets,” Adler says. “Many of the ‘problem’ behaviors associated with hamsters, such as biting and escaping, are actually due to stress and boredom.”\n\nTo prevent behavioral issues, she emphasizes the importance of providing a spacious cage with lots of enrichment.\n\nIt’s always best to research the different hamster species to learn more about their unique characteristics and needs before deciding which is right for you.\n\nThis content was medically reviewed by Chewy vets.\n\nNew Pet",
      "# [What To Do If Your Bird Is Sneezing by Chewy Editorial on 2013-08-06](https://be.chewy.com/sneezing/)\nMost parrots naturally come from tropical, humid climates and when kept indoors as pets the heating and cooling to control indoor climate dries the air. Your bird? nasal passages are then dried, which, in most cases, causes sneezing.\n\nSYMPTOMS\n\nA bird may sneeze for a number of reasons other than it being in an environment that is too dry. Vitamin-A deficiency or a bacterial, fungal or viral infection can also cause sneezing and discharge from your bird? nares. A more serious problem that could cause damage to the nasal or sinus passages could be the case if audible breathing sounds, tail-bobbing, weight loss, nasal or eye discharge or a change in vocalizations or eating habits accompany the sneezing.\n\nIf a bird that is native to Central or South America is housed with or near a dusty bird, such as a cockatoo, cockatiel, African grey or Eclectus, the dander from these birds can cause sneezing in your other birds.\n\nIMMEDIATE CARE\n\nSome sneezing is normal and is likely due to a dry environment. If it becomes a chronic problem or nasal discharge accompanies the sneezing, a full vet check is necessary to determine is the problem is due to some sort of infection.\n\nLONG-TERM CARE\n\nKeep your bird in an adequately humid environment so the cilia in their nasal passages can work properly to clear debris. Provide your bird with a sufficient amount of Vitamin-A, which also helps the nasal passages work properly.\n\nIf the vet tests determine that no disease or infection is the cause for the sneezing, here are several tips for improving your bird? too-dry environment:\n\n1) Take your bird into the bathroom while you shower, enveloping it in high humidity.\n\n2) Have your avian vet show you how to periodically flush your bird? nostrils with sterile saline to remove debris or set up a regular appointment to have your vet perform the saline flushing.\n\n3) Try moving the bird into a room with a humidifier, but always keep the water clean to prevent bacteria from growing\n\n4) Place bird safe plants in your bird? room, which will add oxygen and humidity to its environment.\n\n5) Periodically mist your bird to raise humidity\n\n6) Reduce allergens by running am air filter with HEPA filtration. Run a box fan with an air conditioner filter on the back to catch dust, dander and feathers. This will increase the efficiency of the air filter, which will clean any additional allergens not caught by the fan.\n\nPosted By: Chewy Editorial\n\nFeatured Image: By Ladymoonz/Shutterstock",
      "# [7 Cat Laxatives To Relieve Cat Constipation (and How to Choose the Right One) by Katie Koschalk on 2024-01-11](https://be.chewy.com/cat-laxatives/)\nNormally, a cat’s digestive system purrs right along, smoothly and without a hitch. But sometimes things can get a bit clogged, leading to constipation.\n\nSo, how do you get things moving again? A common approach is the use of cat laxatives, which help stimulate a bowel movement.\n\nThere are seven commonly used cat laxatives, but choosing the right one—with the guidance of your veterinarian—depends on a variety of factors, including the cause of constipation; your cat’s overall health and age; and any underlying medical conditions they have.\n\nWe spoke to vet experts to get the inside scoop on constipation and cat laxatives, including how they can help your furry pal and how to choose the right one.\n\nWhat Is Cat Constipation?\n\nCat constipation is a common health issue where a cat experiences difficulty passing feces or poops less frequently than normal, says Dr. Winnie Ybarra, DVM, DACVIM, a veterinary internist at San Francisco Animal Medical Center in San Francisco.\n\nCats typically poop once per day, although some poop twice daily. Pooping less than this could be a sign of constipation.\n\nAccording to Dr. Nicole Savageau, VMD, a veterinarian with The Vets in Austin, Texas, common causes of constipation in cats include:\n\nDehydration\n\nLack of exercise\n\nStress and anxiety\n\nHairballs\n\nDietary issues and food changes\n\nInflammatory bowel disease\n\nMore serious causes can include pelvic injuries; a blockage due to a foreign body; kidney disease; megacolon (a condition where the colon becomes enlarged); neurological issues; and some types of cancer. In some cases, no underlying cause of constipation can be determined.\n\nSymptoms of Cat Constipation\n\nUnlike humans, cats can’t verbally communicate their discomfort, so it’s important for cat parents to be observant of their feline’s behavior and bodily functions. Recognizing the symptoms of constipation in cats is crucial for timely and effective treatment.\n\nBelow, Dr. Ybarra shares some common symptoms of constipation to watch for.\n\nInfrequent or no bowel movements\n\nHard, round, dry feces (as opposed to well-formed, slightly soft feces)\n\nStraining in the litter box; spending a long time in the litter box; or avoiding the litter box altogether\n\nDisplaying signs of pain or discomfort (like crying out) while trying to defecate\n\nBloody or mucus-covered stools\n\nBlood or mucus around the rectum\n\nLethargy or reduced activity\n\nPoor appetite\n\nVomiting\n\nAbdominal bloating\n\nHow to Help a Constipated Cat: Cat Laxatives\n\nWhen your cat is suffering from constipation, there are several steps you can take to help alleviate their discomfort and address the underlying issue. We’ll touch on the full gamut shortly, but first, let’s zero in on laxatives.\n\nCat laxatives are substances designed to help cats with constipation by facilitating bowel movements. They work in various ways, such as stimulating intestinal muscles or drawing water into the colon.\n\n4 Types of Cat Laxatives\n\nThe choice of laxative depends on the severity of the constipation and the cat’s overall health. There are four main types of laxatives:\n\nLubricant laxatives: Coats the stool and intestines in a lubricating film, easing the passage of feces.\n\nOsmotic laxatives: Draws water into the colon from surrounding tissues. This increased water content helps soften the stool and increases its volume, which, in turn, stimulates bowel movements.\n\nStimulant laxatives: Triggers the intestines to contract and push out the stool.\n\nBulk-forming laxatives: Provides fiber, which increases the bulk of the stool. This can stimulate a cat’s bowels.\n\n7 Common Cat Laxatives\n\nAccording to Dr. Ybarra and Dr. Savageau, common cat laxatives include:\n\nCat Lax (lubricant)\n\nMineral oil (lubricant)\n\nPolyethylene glycol 3350, aka Miralax (osmotic)\n\nLactulose (osmotic)\n\nCisapride (stimulant)\n\nMetoclopramide (stimulant)\n\nPsyllium husk, aka Metamucil (bulk-forming)\n\nWhile not technically a laxative, canned, unsweetened pumpkin can also sometimes help relieve constipation. Pumpkins have a high water and fiber content, and can hydrate the intestines and their contents. A couple of pet parent pumpkin favorites are Weruva Pureed Pumpkin and Nummy Tum-Tum Pumpkin. Note that these pumpkin foods should not replace your cat’s regular food but rather act as a supplement to relieve occasional constipation.\n\nWeruva Pumpkin Patch Up! Dog & Cat Pouches, case of 12\n\n$11.99\n\nCat Lax Cat Supplement\n\n$10.23\n\nWhich Cat Laxative Should You Use?\n\nThe right laxative for your cat depends on a variety of factors, including the cause of constipation; your cat’s overall health and age; and any underlying medical conditions, says Dr. Ybarra.\n\nIt’s crucial to only give your cat a laxative based on a veterinarian’s recommendation and with their guidance. This not only ensures the treatment’s efficacy but also your feline friend’s safety and well-being. The improper or unsupervised use of laxatives can lead to complications such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalances or worsened constipation.\n\nIn addition to selecting a suitable laxative, your vet may also discuss other aspects of care that can help manage or prevent constipation.\n\nCat Laxative vs. Stool Softener\n\nWhen addressing constipation in cats, it’s important to understand the difference between a cat laxative and a stool softener for cats, as they serve different purposes in managing the condition.\n\nCat Laxatives\n\nLaxatives are generally used when there’s a need to actively induce a bowel movement.\n\nThey produce bowel movements in one of three ways:\n\nStimulating the muscles of the intestines\n\nDrawing water into the bowel from surrounding tissues\n\nIncreasing the weight or “bulk” of the stool\n\nStool Softeners\n\nStool softeners, on the other hand, work by increasing the amount of water absorbed by the stool in the intestines, Dr. Savageau says. This process results in softer stool, which is easier for the cat to pass.\n\nStool softeners are particularly beneficial for cats who need to avoid straining during defecation, such as those with certain medical conditions or post-surgical cases.\n\nIn some cases, both laxatives and stool softeners are used.\n\nWhen to Go to the Vet\n\nIf not properly treated, constipation in cats can lead to several health risks, some of which can be life-threatening, such as:\n\nMegacolon: A condition where the colon becomes abnormally enlarged and loses its ability to function properly. This can be caused by the colon being consistently stretched more than it should be, such as when a cat has chronic constipation.\n\nObstipation: A severe form of constipation where a cat cannot pass any stool or gas, usually due to fecal matter becoming dry and hard in the intestines.\n\nToxemia: A condition that can occur when prolonged constipation leads to the accumulation and stagnation of feces in the colon. This stagnation can result in the absorption of toxins into the bloodstream.\n\nDue to these risks, it’s essential to treat constipation promptly. If constipation persists for more than 24–48 hours, bring your cat to a veterinarian. The doctor can assess your cat’s health; work to determine the underlying cause; and provide a treatment plan.\n\nCat Constipation Treatment\n\nDr. Savageau shares some common cat constipation remedies, including:\n\nIncrease water intake: Dehydration is a common cause of constipation. Ensure your cat has access to fresh, clean water at all times. Consider using a cat water fountain, such as the Drinkwell Pet Fountain or Catit Flower Fountain, as cats often prefer running water. Learn more tips to get your kitty to drink more water.\n\nDietary changes: Your vet might recommend incorporating more fiber and water into your cat’s diet through wet food, specially formulated cat food or nutritional supplements, such as psyllium husk or canned pumpkin. A higher fiber diet should be introduced gradually to avoid upsetting your cat’s stomach.\n\nLaxatives or stool softeners: Your vet might give your cat specific laxatives or stool softeners to get things moving or soften the stool.\n\nExercise: Encourage your cat to engage in regular physical activity. Play sessions can help stimulate digestion and bowel movements.\n\nReducing stress: In some cases, stress and anxiety can cause constipation. Stress can be caused by big things like adding a new pet to the house, or smaller things like construction noise outside. Soothing your cat, and reducing or removing environmental stress, if possible, could help ease constipation. Explore popular cat calming aids.\n\nUltimately, the treatment for constipation depends on its severity, adds Dr. Ybarra. “If the constipation is mild, adding water, canned food or fiber to the diet can help,” she says. If it’s more severe, enemas (performed by a vet) and medication might be needed. “Very severe cases require manual deobstipation under anesthesia,” she says.\n\nBy recognizing the symptoms of constipation, knowing when to seek veterinary assistance and understanding the treatment options available, you can ensure your cat remains comfortable and healthy.\n\nLooking for more information surrounding kitty bathroom conundrums? Find out how to handle kitten constipation and why your cat might have stopped using their litter box.\n\nExpert input provided by Dr. Winnie Ybarra, DVM, DACVIM, a veterinary internist at San Francisco Animal Medical Center in San Francisco; and Dr. Nicole Savageau, VMD, a veterinarian with The Vets in Austin, Texas.\n\nBeWell\n\nFeatured Products\n\nNummy Tum-Tum Pure Organic Pumpkin Canned Dog & Cat Food Supplement, 15-oz, case of 12\n\n$40.80\n\nCatit Flower Plastic Cat Fountain, 100-oz\n\n$27.99",

I use the VoiceOver screen reader on my iPhone 15 Pro running iOS 18.0.1. The latest version of your app has basically rendered the app useless to screen reader user, such as myself. In the past, I have been able to use the app without any issues. However, now it is impossible for me to search for items, get details on items, add items to my basket without calling your customer service phone number. This is something I prefer not to do. per the ADA, your app needs to be made accessible for all users, no matter the disability. Your customer care team has been wonderful, but. my having to call customer care to look for items and place an order does not put me on equal footing with everyone else. Could the developers, please, please look into fixing the accessibility problems with the app?",

They are always there for me and so thoughtful and kind. I love that they send birthday cards to my pets as I currently have 6 dogs and 2 cats and it is very heart warming for all of us. We recently lost 2 dogs, Daisy that was 15-1/2 years old and Domino unexpectedly at only 5 years old with kidney disease told to us by the ER vet from ingesting antifreeze as a puppy prior to us rescuing him. Both losses were devastating to us as these rescues are our children. Chewy was so kind as to send an email with their condolences. I was very touched by that and cried again. Once when I lost my 15 year old cat Oliver, they sent a dozen of the most beautiful roses I have ever seen! I cried then too. And they also sent me a Chewy ball cap and tennis ball for the pups as a thank you! Granted I do spend a lot at Chewy due to all our rescues, but they do not have to do all these extras. They are the only company I have dealt with that let’s you know they truly appreciate your business. So a HUGE THANK YOU TO CHEWY and God bless you always!  We love you!",

They are always there for me and so thoughtful and kind. I love that they send birthday cards to my pets as I currently have 6 dogs and 2 cats and it is very heart warming for all of us. We recently lost 2 dogs, Daisy that was 15-1/2 years old and Domino unexpectedly at only 5 years old with kidney disease told to us by the ER vet from ingesting antifreeze as a puppy prior to us rescuing him. Both losses were devastating to us as these rescues are our children. Chewy was so kind as to send an email with their condolences. I was very touched by that and cried again. Once when I lost my 15 year old cat Oliver, they sent a dozen of the most beautiful roses I have ever seen! I cried then too. And they also sent me a Chewy ball cap and tennis ball for the pups as a thank you! Granted I do spend a lot at Chewy due to all our rescues, but they do not have to do all these extras. They are the only company I have dealt with that let’s you know they truly appreciate your business. So a HUGE THANK YOU TO CHEWY and God bless you always!  We love you!",

But feel free to delete if this is really the wrong place!)\n\nBased on my two recent experiences, I’m convinced this is the best company out there and I’d love to hear more good tales about them just to keep my good faith. \n\nI recently ordered the wrong type of leash for my dog. Asked about a return/exchange. They said, “we’ll refund you, but don’t worry about returning it. Just donate it to a local shelter or rescue!”\n\nAmazing! I will!\n\nThen I ordered the right type of leash and then accidentally sent me two. So I send a message saying “it’s no skin off my back since I didn’t pay for two, but if you want it back I’ll send it back.” And they were like “oops! Accidents happen. Go ahead and donate it to a shelter or rescue.”\n\nLike, I’m sure they get some sort of write off for this. And both leashes together were not even $35 they lost. But how often does this happen? Do the little things adding up not make as big of a dent in their profits as it’s worth? They could easily ask for these things back and keep their stock up so they can resell them. But they’re choosing to let me donate them instead?\n\nSeems like a really good company and it makes me feel better about ordering from them instead of shopping at my local pet store, which didn’t carry the leash I needed anyway, but I felt bad nonetheless.\n\n\n\n## Comment ID hui0bdr with +53 score by [(rike103, Reddit, 2022-01-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/sea3aa/anyone_have_a_good_experience_with_chewy/hui0bdr/) (in reply to ID sea3aa):\nChewy is awsome they messed up on my order the first time and made it up by not only giving me an extra bag of food but they threw in some treats,they occasionally throw free stuff with my orders\n\n## Comment ID hui18i1 with +66 score by [(atlantisgate, Reddit, 2022-01-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/sea3aa/anyone_have_a_good_experience_with_chewy/hui18i1/) (in reply to ID sea3aa):\nI appreciate that they are willing to do stuff like this, and I do order from them pretty often as a result. There have been a few orders here and there over the years that have had damaged product, or just little stuff like that that happens, and they are always hassle free for me to deal with when that crops up.\n\nI also have to shout out their fast shipping, especially as a car-free human. It's really great to have stuff I need get here fast when since not that easy for me to run out and pick something up.\n\nOn the other hand, I know they undercut vet's offices in drug pricing on purpose, and it's to their benefit to write off a $10 leash if they get a customer who will always get expensive prescriptions from them.\n\nThey can be a real pain in the ass with prescription information with vet offices. I once had trouble getting something filled, and my vet told me multiple times they HAD faxed the paperwork to Chewy, but Chewy kept telling me they needed my vet to respond; My vet showed me the logs and they absolutely were in the right. Lots of vets struggle with them.\n\nSo yes! In many ways a great company, especially for consumers. But also, no point in losing sight of the fact that they're still a giant company who can really give small businesses/clinics a headache!\n\n### Comment ID huk2n9q with +25 score by [(InvalidUserNemo, Reddit, 2022-01-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/sea3aa/anyone_have_a_good_experience_with_chewy/huk2n9q/) (in reply to ID hui18i1):\nJumping on the top comment.

Also get a couple meds on auto ship.  They have always been amazing to me.  At one point, one or my orders got lost in transit. They overnighted a replacement shipment at no charge and told me to keep the regular one when it showed up.  \n\nAbout 6 months after we lost our kidney dog, I was updating my info on my profile and I finally removed him.  The next day I got the most gorgeous bouquet of flowers and a sympathy card.  \n\nI have a friend whose shipment got delayed in shipping.  She contacted them about it. They refunded her money so she could get something locally while she waited for her shipment to arrive.  \n\nI see other comments that the pharmacy side has problems, but I haven’t encountered that yet, and my vet tells me to get some of our meds through them, so they don’t seem to be having trouble yet.  \n\nThat said, I still go to local small shops for treats and toys and stuff like that.

We hadn’t used them before, and thought our dog was having hip dysplasia issues so we ordered a bunch of meds ($300 worth). About a day later she tore her CCL and needed TPLO surgery. We were devastated. Not only is that surgery super hard for dogs, but it’s expensive. I chatted with a Chewy customer service rep and explained to them that we needed to cancel our order because it turned out it was not what we thought it was and our dog needed surgery. The rep was super kind and sweet, and canceled our order no issue.\n\nProbably three days after that, we got a flower delivery.

My wife and I are adopting a dog on Saturday. In preparation for our dog we shopped around to see which store would be cheapest for supplies. Between Amazon, Petsmart, Petco, and Chewy, Chewy was the cheapest by far, and had great reviews for their in house label. We ordered about $300 dollars worth of supplies. The shipment came in 4 different boxes. During shipment FedEx tracking noted 1 box was damaged. The bottle of urine cleaner had leaked or broken. We could tell because FedEx repackaged it and the cleaner was missing. Without us contacting Chewy support, Chewy resent the whole order. Not just the urine cleaner. We are talking $300dollars worth of stuff. I contacted support and informed them that all items were fine and we only needed the cleaner. They said don’t worry, either use all the extra items or donate them.

When my dog had an allergic reaction to a can food id bought my girlfriend insisted I contact them to send the remaining cans back since he’d only eaten one can and their website says you can return if you’re unsatisfied. They sent me another flavor free of charge of the same brand an encouraged me to donate the remaining unopened cans to a shelter. They even added a little note for my dog saying they hoped he was feeling better and “ready to eat”\n\nAlso I don’t think it counts towards their tax since the donation isn’t coming from them . It’s coming from you to your shelter or rescue and not directly from their company. But I could be wrong. \n\nI genuinely think they are just a good company built but pet people for pet people.

Still incredibly nice.\n\nMy dog May, has been on kidney food, but doesn't need it anymore.  Chewy gave me a partial refund and I can donate the left over food.\n\nI could go on and on.

      "# Post ID 1cbzc1f: Alternatives to Chewy? with +52 score by [(cinnderly, Reddit, 2024-04-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/1cbzc1f/alternatives_to_chewy/)\nThis isn't about price. In February a Chewy box that was delivered had a shard of glass under the label that punctured my finger deeply. It had to be glued closed, ended up getting infected and needing more treatment, and because I'm a massage therapist I was out of work for a week. After going back and forth with them for a while they simply stated \"we won't be doing anything for you\". Like not even a coupon or something?? It was a freak situation, and I know it's not their negligence necessarily... But it left a bad taste in my mouth and I just don't want to give them my money anymore. Any suggestions are much appreciated, thanks. 🙏\n\n\nETA: I shouldn't be surprised I suppose, but the amount of people who are pissed about this post (why?) and are now looking through my comment history is kind of wild. Even pulling quotes. You guys should take a break, Reddit must be raising your blood pressure and I worry for your health. (Though at least one of them is someone I know in real life that for some reason loves to reply to me on Reddit with new accounts to say mean shit.) \n\nNote to self: don't ask for help on Reddit. Sheesh.\n\nAll of the costumer service reps I spoke with over the course of several weeks -- who contacted ME by the way -- were absolutely lovely. It was the big kahuna at the end who first wanted me to send him ask my info, then called back two minutes later to say flatly that they would not be doing anything. I did feel a little guilty asking for help but big companies have insurance and what if it was a kid that got cut? This incident was not my fault, and my finger still feels like there's something in it. Nothing in my order was glass. I can't say I trust corporations much anyway, but yes, Chewy seems to be one of the nicer ones. I just don't feel good about giving them my money anymore, what can I say?\n\nThank you very much to the MANY more people here who have been so kind and helpful. I appreciate your time, and your suggestions. 🙏\n\n## Comment ID l13rh4y with +57 score by [(Benicetome23, Reddit, 2024-04-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/1cbzc1f/alternatives_to_chewy/l13rh4y/) (in reply to ID 1cbzc1f):\nIm surprised.

It sucks! \n\nI am not trying to change your mind on finding a new supplier, I imagine that even Chewy would prefer you do so as they probably see you as a liability to them.  But I am surprised that it isn't incredibly obvious to you and everyone why Chewy wouldn't do anything for you. \n\nChewy could not give you so much as a coupon because in a legal situation a lawyer would absolutely try to argue that their doing so was an admittance of guilt.  The fact that you called a lawyer is proof that they were right to not give you anything. There is no likely way to prove where the glass came from or even if that is where your cut came from; pictures wouldn't be enough. It could, for example, be argued that you could have cut yourself on a tool you used to open the package or on other broken glass in your home. Even if under the label, glass could've worked its way there in shipping and also packages often have to be re-labeled during shipping. If you'd have injured yourself in an actual store, there are security cameras and witnesses and such that would make fault much easier to prove. Chewy would have to be incredibly foolish to take any accountability for something that can't likely be proven. Just as it is your responsibility to look out for your best interests, it is their responsibility to look out for their best interests. I am not trying to defend them here, just offering an explanation as to why you got nothing from them.\n\n## Comment ID l12jch8 with +5 score by [(SlitheringFlower, Reddit, 2024-04-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/1cbzc1f/alternatives_to_chewy/l12jch8/) (in reply to ID 1cbzc1f):\nI'm so sorry this happened to you and am disappointed chewy didn't do more! \n\nTractor supply co. has an eclectic assortment of pet supplies.

      "# Post ID ggdkrq: I'm a Vet. Here's why I hate Chewy. [discussion] with +3146 score by [(PrinceofPersians, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/)\nNo, it's not the revenue loss.  Pretty much every vet who's not on the brink of retirement age has accepted the loss of the in-clinic pharmacy as an inevitability.  This post also isn't about online pharmacies in general.  I don't necessarily *like* Walmart, or 1-800-PETMEDS, or Allivet.  However, I *hate* Chewy.\n\nMy problem is the dishonesty.  You ever get one of those emails or calls where they say your vet hasn't approved the prescription?  Our clients sure did too.  In fact, Chewy accidentally sent us an email recently that was meant for clients:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Dear Pet Parent,  \n>  \n>Chewy is committed to your pet's health and happiness. Challenging times like these will never change that.  \n>  \n>We are actively working to contact your veterinarian to get your pet’s prescription approved, so we can deliver your pet’s essential medicine as fast as possible. Unfortunately, we haven't been able to get through as of yet.  \n>  \n>These are unprecedented times and it may be possible that your vet is extra busy or working reduced hours. If you’d like to help, you can also contact your veterinarian’s office to find out where they are with approvals.  \n>  \n>Your pet's well-being will always be our top priority and we’re doing everything we can to make sure your order goes through.  \n>  \n>We appreciate your support. Stay well and find moments of comfort with your pet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"We're working oh so hard on getting the prescription to you, if only your vet would approve it!\"\n\nWhat we found from several of our clients: on numerous occasions (or perhaps all), they were sending this email out the *second* they actually sent the email requesting approval from your vet.  Our clinic always printed out and took care of all approvals by noon the day the prescription requests came in.   Yet, we had always dealt with clients angry about how we weren't approving their scripts.  We would have to send approvals multiple times.  In fact we eventually had to disconnect our fax simply because sending Chewy scripts 3-4 times for each request clogged a free phone line and took up a lot of time.   Chewy tended to be the most egregious of the companies to do this.\n\nSo instead we stuck with emails which have convenient time stamps...and the ability to bcc them to the client :)\n\nSuddenly, when we started sending these emails to the client with a time stamp from both Chewy's email and our approval, they were calling Chewy instead of us to complain, yelling at customer service when they tried to call the client and claim we weren't approving it, or ditching Chewy altogether.  We got to see both sides ourselves too.  On one fun occasion, we didn't have a medication that our tech needed for her dog but could only order a 1000 count bottle, so she ordered from Chewy.  They didn't respond for about 5 days, then sent the first and only email approval to us at 5pm on a Saturday and then the email to our technician that they were unable to reach us after three attempts at about 7am the following morning.\n\nThen the demands came from Chewy for either verbal approval (no paper trail, and no accountability for them), or fax (a paper trail but difficult to send/prove to client, so in most cases, still no accountability for them).  On one occasion we denied both and told them via phone to email three times over the span of an hour, admittedly with some rudeness on the third, and they proceeded to try to send a fax through our phone line consecutively for 35 minutes straight.  I was doing an emergency surgery on a dog with a wound with a bad bleeder from the linguofacial vein while this was happening.  Needless to say, it was hard to concentrate on saving the patient but we couldn't disconnect the phone line in case another urgent call needed to be answered.  The dog did fine (for anyone worrying about this) :).\n\nAll of the dishonesty with the timing of approvals have been worse recently.  I suspect related to difficulty with supply in the COVID-19 crisis.  It's been tough for us too, and we've been honest with clients about this.  So with Chewy, I suspect that instead of saying \"we're having shipping delays\" or \"we're on backorder for that very common thing\", they're simply claiming the vet isn't responding while they deal with delayed arrivals/shipments.\n\nSo now they've stopped doing emails altogether.  They can do fax or verbal approval (again, no accountability), or a new option.  They have an online platform called Petscriptions (again from what their own customer service implied, communication on the timing of prescriptions had no accountability for them, they can say whatever they want).  Furthermore, with yours and our data becoming a more valuable resource, I don't want to make the data mining that every online company does even easier for them.\n\nI'm not writing this for the revenue.  You've all heard the \"shop local\" argument so many times I'd be beating a dead horse by saying it.  Money is tight, especially now.  And if you wanted to order online to save some money, I encourage you to do so.  I'm writing this because Chewy has peddled the idea that they genuinely *care* about your pets, through those occasional oil paintings from someone you and your dog have never met, to the kindhearted condolence texts that, when you read them with an objective eye, seem suspiciously formulaic, to the \"customer is always right\" level of pandering that you and I both know is harmful.  However, the stuff I described above is how they behave when dealing with a vital step in getting your pet the medication they need.  Given that this is one of those steps that you can't see, I think it's telling of how much they *actually* care about your pet.\n\nIt shouldn't need to be said that a corporation doesn't care about you or your fur-buddy, but here it is.  I only say this because there *are* people who care about your pet: you, your family, your neighbors (well, sometimes).   And yes, also your doggy daycare workers, your groomers, every worker at your vets office.  If we didn't care about your pet, we wouldn't have accepted far less money for the same work that human equivalents would make in all aspects.  So please, reserve your trust for the people who have actually tried to earn it, and don't let a group of people you've never met put a wedge between you.\n\nPeace, love, wags, and purrs,\n\nA pissed-off dogtor\n\ntl;dr: Chewy is a dishonest trainwreck that doesn't care about you or your pet any more than the other corporate online pharmacies (perhaps even less).\n\nEDIT: I'm sorry about not replying so long.  I work half days on Saturday and didn't feel right messing around on Reddit on shift.  A few things to add or discuss since I probably won't be able to reply to everything.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*FIRST AND FOREMOST\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*:  I got a message from a previous Chewy employee who will remain anonymous due to what you can see in the post:\n\n>Hey there! I worked for said company mentioned earlier (signed a kind of NDA) and I want you to know that you're right. I worked in customer service for almost a year before moving up, and I have to say that the company is BS. There was no communication between locations, and the longer we went on, the more people straight up ignored any communication without getting reprimanded.  \n>  \n>I hated working with vets, although I'm studying to be one, and I felt like crap after getting off the phone. Sometimes there would be a case floating around for a week, and no one cared to look at the \"email only\" notes or \"please call after faxing\"... It was embarrassing.  \n>  \n>I worked in the QA department for a while, but left after they refused to give me a raise, although I was the only person in the department with a degree and the knowledge of small animals,. exotics, and farm to keep the department going. No regrets. Terrible place for a person with an IQ over 35.  \n>  \n>Please don't share my name 😊\n\nI really appreciated that and just want to say that if this user stuck through all that (including some angry vets and techs and receptionists which I can sometimes be myself) then they've got the kind of tough our profession needs now more than ever :)\n\nSECOND:  Some people have brought up that their vet recommends Chewy or that their vet says they've never had a problem with them.  This may be true.  I do not know how the company works.  Perhaps its regional, perhaps its random.  But given that there is an employee here saying otherwise and numerous people in veterinary and human medicine confirming that this is a shared experience, I think it's safe to say that this is a widespread problem.  Furthermore, one should keep in mind that Chewy is owned by Petsmart, and Petsmart is in a partnership with Banfield.  I should also say that I don't know the status but I remember a previous attempt of a Banfield merger with Blue Pearl and VCA.  So the point here is that I wouldn't be surprised if some vets aren't allowed to bash Chewy or perhaps get financial incentive to send clients there specifically.   Or perhaps Chewy simply does better dealing with the clinics under their own umbrella.  Or it's nothing but coincidence, I'm a vet not a psychic.\n\nTHIRD: Yes, they have great customer service when speaking with you.  The point of this post is to discuss what happens to people who aren't the client and what happens to your prescriptions--that your pet needs--behind the scenes.\n\nI'll edit more as needed or try to respond better to comments individually but there are a lot more than I anticipated o\\_O\n\nBasically, just be wary of any company where you'll never be able to chat with the boss (and also be wary of that boss if you can chat with them).  For example, I hear Jeff Bezos is building an actual giant clock that's totally not a doomsday device in the middle of his desert mountain.  Anyways, please be safe, keep 6 feet distance from any of those gross \"other people\", and stay fuzzy, soldiers.\n\nEdit 2: I spelled bad :(\n\nEdit 3: We've got another employee.  Thank you very much  PoodlePopXX\n\n>As some one who worked for Chewy, they are an actual trash company. They treat their employee like garbage and they run unsafe warehouses. Everything and everyone is a number to them no matter who hard you work. Their attendance policy is a joke and is meant to push people out as quickly as they come in.  \n>  \n>Just one example, one night an industrial lithium battery exploded and caught fire. A good portion of the warehouse filled with dark black smoke that smelled terrible. People passed out, others couldn’t breath, and they didn’t want to open the doors or let people go outside and stop working for fresh air. The entire warehouse needed to keep working. People had headaches all night. Three people ended up hospitalized. They had to call ambulances. If you felt awful from the smoke inhalation and air quality you could choose to go home, but you’d have to take attendance points against your record. That’s the kind of company they are.  \n>  \n>I ordered from there often before I worked there. After I worked there I wouldn’t order from there if it was free.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Comment ID fq09ei4 with +520 score by [(endersendgame, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq09ei4/) (in reply to ID ggdkrq):\nAs someone who worked as a vet receptionist for 2.5 years I can say this is 100% true! There were days we fielded more calls from Chewy reps than clients looking for verbal approval on scripts they claim they had sent yet never did. Or angry clients claiming Chewy had told them they sent the request days ago and we never responded. It was infuriating! Our solution was to make Chewy resend the email or fax and never give verbal approval so we had a paper trail.

My retail experience is limited, but as a pharmacist I cannot imagine losing a script I handwrote from a provider I spoke with on the phone. It is so rare that providers call in their own scripts. Nine times out of ten, it was was pill mill doc if they were calling themselves.\n\n## Comment ID fq0c2q5 with +54 score by [(horton_hears_a_homie, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq0c2q5/) (in reply to ID ggdkrq):\nYES I'm a receptionist and I deal with so many angry calls from customers who say Chewy has tried to reach us and that they were unable to and the reality was that:\n\na) we never got the email\nb) we did get the email JUST THEN and it was in the process of being approved\n\nor \n\nc) we got the email, got it approved, and sent it back and for some reason Chewy hadn't processed it yet\n\n\nI even tried to call Chewy for a client one day (which I'm not supposed to do but I was so fed up with trying to deal with it through the client I had to do something) and was on hold for a whole hour and never got a person.

Chewy and others have had issues with counterfeit product.\n\nChewy is known for fantastic customer service and that’s awesome!  However, please understand that vets have an ENTIRELY different experience with them.  We do not mind helping you get product at a lower cost because our primary goal is to keep your pets healthy!  I much rather your pet not get Lyme disease than sell you flea and tick product.\n\nJust know, it costs us time, money and frustration to have to deal with these pharmacies who are frequently hostile toward us.  It is a love/hate relationship.\n\nWe have to divert man power to lose money to pharmacies which is okay if it helps our patients. Fulfilling one script can take our techs up to 15 minutes as techs have to find the chart, ensure the medication is acceptable by checking the medical history, contact the owners (who usually don’t answer) to triple check that they have been on it for things such as heartworm, and then chase down a doctor to sign (usually with a patient). Once the vet has it, we have to review everything from medical history to dosage, and sign off.  Then it goes back to the tech who must send it off.  This occurs all while both the tech and doctor are seeing patients, performing surgeries, reviewing cases and performing our other job duties.  We do about 35 of these a day.  But I repeat, we will do it as long as you keep your pets on the medications they need!\n\nAlso, majority of us are not trying to rip you off.  Our prices are higher because we stock lesser quantities!  Always ask about rebates!\n\nOh god, this turned into a rant.  Sorry.\n\n### Comment ID fq133a1 with +4 score by [(codenameblackmamba, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq133a1/) (in reply to ID fq0khui):\nGreat tip about the rebates - my dog’s medication is 2x more expensive through the vet’s pharmacy compared to online suppliers, but all the online suppliers have been out of stock for a few months so we’ve had no choice.

I most certainly don't think my smaller vet clinic didn't approve it, they probably didn't see it yet or, perhaps they only approve things a certain time every day, so it can take longer then expected.  If I have an emergency type script, I'm not using chewy, as you can never get a large company to move their ass in matters that only are important to you. But you'll always have a better response from your vet. Even if I have to call my vet later, I'm assuming something was missed (on either side) and now that they're expecting it, after I call chewy, it should be fine. Of course, I worked in a Drs office for about 5 years, many years ago, so maybe that's why I'm not freaking out about these things.  Honestly, I expect to have these issues with Any company I might use for my pet's rx, as the company is only as good as the underpaid person requesting the approval. I also feel clear communication from the vet or staff can change the dialogue here.  Something like \"We'll get to the bottom of this, but I do want to let you know we've been having some problems with Chewy saying they did things that they didn't\".  It's not like you have to protect Chewy when they mess up.  I really hope you do tell your clients about these issues each time.  Chewy asks for feedback all the time, and if people were aware and reported these issues it's possible Chewy might get their head out of their ass.\n\n### Comment ID fq0wj5h with +6 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq0wj5h/) (in reply to ID fq0pxxg):\nI'm the same tbh.

They recommended trying 1-800 PET MEDS or Chewy as an option, so I went with Chewy since we already got kitty litter through them. \n\nCouple of things that went through my mind:\n\n1. I wish the vet office had told us they were no longer carrying the med BEFORE we were about to run out. Luckily with COVID, I was trying to stay a week ahead of things but normally I’d wait till a day before they’d run out. (This is more of a personal complaint than a Chewy complaint). But, I ordered ASAP and there was no lapse in medicine for the pup. \n\n2. I’d heard this about Chewy from friends who are vets. Also that the drugs aren’t “guaranteed” like they are at a vet’s office. That’s not the best word, but the best my brain could come up with. If the medicine doesn’t work/makes your pet sick,/etc., Chewy can’t/won’t do anything to right the wrong, whereas your vets office might. \n\n3. I went with Chewy because of ease, I already had an account with them. But I can change if it’s not the best option.\n\nVet workers of the world, knowing my vet’s office simply doesn’t carry the med anymore- would you recommend I reorder through 1-800 PET MEDS over Chewy?

I hate Walmart as an entity but haven't had problems with their pharmacy.  Allivet has given us some trouble but not a ton.  Avoid any less known online pharmacies.  I know of a guy who used to do medication quality testing and said that some of the weird pharmacies would send medications with 1. none of the actual medication in the pills, 2. a different dosage than what was listed, 3. a different medication, and he even said one was tested and found to have road paint in it to match the color of the actual tablet.

For long-time clients, he also will give some leeway if clients are struggling that month. It's always really helpful.

They get an insane bulk discount. Vets don’t always carry the massive size bags because they will expire before they can sell them. If you ask reception at your vet office to special order you a specific size of food they 100% will. If it’s not a size they normally carry you can ask the office manger how much it would be before you place the order since they probably haven’t done the math on the price vs order price yet. \nThey just need a heads up cause every vet I’ve ever worked for has to place one big order at a time to get the free shipping so they wait until they have a order together.  \n\nAlso for pet parents starting a new prescription food a lot of people like to buy the small bags Incase the animal hates it. Also vets will fully 100% refund the price of the bag of food if you cat or dog refuses it. We can return the open bag of food to manufacture and get refunded. Win/win. Half the companies require us to send the food back the other half of companies don’t and we usually give those open bags of food away to clients who literally can’t afford anything.

Thanks for taking the time to share it. \n\nI have a great relationship with our vet—we’ve used them for over twenty years, through four dogs, three cats, a turtle and a snake; two dogs, two cats and turtle currently. Just a few years ago our oldest dog got a terrible infection that required several expensive meds and when the doc brought the ‘scrip out he said flat out to me that I could get it cheaper at the Walgreens down the street. I asked him what numbers we’re talking about and it was hundreds. \n\nThat kind of behavior between vets and patients builds trust and is one of the reasons I’ve been with my vets for over two decades. There’s also the great care and friendly staff. \n\nAnyway, what kind of chronic illnesses are animals dealing with that multiple animal pharmaceutical companies are required? Or are pets being over medicated? I’ve had nine animals over the past ~30 years, I get some animals have chronic conditions. What we’ve needed for our animals was reasonably priced at our vet or we found it at regular drugstores at a cheaper price. I also know my vet practice’s philosophy is low key and they have advised against medications for my animals—kitty Prozac for a particularly odd cat we have now. Understandably, that’s not a lot of evidence from which to extrapolate a cogent opinion on the issue, I just don’t get that kind of market for medications for pets.\n\n### Comment ID fq0bxhu with +14 score by [(Emulocks, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq0bxhu/) (in reply to ID fq060to):\nAccording to this website:\n https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-pet-statistics\n\nthere are almost 103 million cats and dogs owned as pets in the US.

They treat their employee like garbage and they run unsafe warehouses. Everything and everyone is a number to them no matter who hard you work. Their attendance policy is a joke and is meant to push people out as quickly as they come in. \n\nJust one example, one night an industrial lithium battery exploded and caught fire. A good portion of the warehouse filled with dark black smoke that smelled terrible. People passed out, others couldn’t breath, and they didn’t want to open the doors or let people go outside and stop working for fresh air. The entire warehouse needed to keep working. People had headaches all night. Three people ended up hospitalized. They had to call ambulances. If you felt awful from the smoke inhalation and air quality you could choose to go home, but you’d have to take attendance points against your record. That’s the kind of company they are.\n\nI ordered from there often before I worked there.

A lot of times the markup or profit margin is actually LOWER for smaller owned facilities because they’re paying more to have the product in house at all. It’s corporatization at its finest.

I used to be a vet tech, and Chewy were okay about prescriptions, I think, but I never dealt with that side of it in the office, so I'm not sure. Even though I no longer work with my former employer, I still always get my pets' pain meds, flea and tick medicine, heartworm prevention, etc. from my vet of 20+ years, so I haven't had to deal with Chewy on the pharmacy front. But with just regular packages...even before coronavirus and not ordering near holidays, they were *always* late coming to my door. This is even with me ordering over $50 on stuff, which is supposed to mean I would get 2-day shipping. Instead, I would get packages a week or so later. I wouldn't have been so upset if they didn't have *huge* banners all over their website that said free 2-day shipping for orders over $50 lmao whenever I ordered stuff below $50, it would take even longer.\n\nNeedless to say, I no longer shop with them. I got tired of emailing them to ask where my stuff was, especially if it was time-sensitive (not prescription meds, but things like dog food because I was running low and only had maybe 3 days left, or even cosequin tablets that needs to be taken every day to remain effective -- my dogs not having any for 4+ days resulted in pain for my poor seniors).

There was a grand total of one time they were able to fill my order correctly without me having to call in because something was out of stock, etc.\n\nThat said, I'm still going to use them. The fact of the matter is, the heartworm meds were about a third the price compared to my vet, and not having to run to the store to get dog food every week is extremely nice especially since my dog has the one two combo of reactivity and separation anxiety.

I’ve had trouble with Chewy from the get go just for fricking dog toys and the order being delayed for weeks.... and long before the current slow shipping pandemic situation.  My sister lives two hours south of me and she’s been a Chewy customer for a long time but recently gave up on them.  I’ve never gotten scripts for my critters from Chewy, Allivet is just a stone’s throw away so shipping has always been quite fast and they’re very good about getting approval WHEN their online selection of vets included our new doctor that is (had an issue with vet “not approving” the prescription....I sent an angry text to our vet but as it turns out, it was Allivet’s mistake because they’re system “reverted” to our former vet, who recently retired.  But we got it all straightened out and since (and long before) this situation, they’ve always done a great job.  I’ve never gotten vet meds from Walmart or any walk in pharmacy with the one exception of an eye “moisturizer” for my elderly basset hound, and the Walgreens pharmacist was kind enough to recommend an equally good but less expensive option.\n\nThat said, idk what’s been going on with Chewy but after my first experience I’ve been reluctant to ever order from them again, even like I said, for dog toys and an orthopedic pet bed....\n\nI know vets must be run off their feet right now and mine recently came to the house (but examined my pups in the garage, not inside) and I couldn’t believe she was kind enough to do this given the current social isolation scenario.  But I’m disabled and it’s very difficult to get 3 dogs in and out of the car (the largest of whom is 100+ pounds and has a deformed foot so jumping up is very painful) so her home visit was more appreciated than she’ll ever know.  I consider vets on the front line because even in quarantine, life for our critters goes on and they must be tended to like always....\n\nSo from the bottom of my heart, thank you for continuing to do your thing.....I for one (and I’m most definitely NOT alone) am forever grateful.\n\n### Comment ID fq33cwv with +1 score by [(PrinceofPersians, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq33cwv/) (in reply to ID fq31t94):\nThank you so much, that means a lot to us in general.

I called chewy back and let them know and I also mentioned that I believed my vet when they said they responded timely and chewy overlooked it.\n\n## Comment ID fq9vtht with +2 score by [(makiehaole, Reddit, 2020-05-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq9vtht/) (in reply to ID ggdkrq):\nOn May 4 within 15 minutes of each other, I ordered flea/tick medicine from 1800-Pet-Meds and heart worm medicine from Chewy (cost worked better that way); both requiring vet approval. \n\nThe next day at 4pm, 1800-Pet-Meds had sent me a shipping confirmation (indicating there were no issues reaching out to my pup's vet). It's now almost a week later and all I've gotten from Chewy is the email you mentioned every other day. \n\nThanks for making it clear that I should just avoid them in the future, despite the cost advantage!\n\n## Comment ID hnoqwiz with +2 score by [(trhughes1997, Reddit, 2021-12-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/hnoqwiz/) (in reply to ID ggdkrq):\nI work as the customer service manager at a vets office and we get the BS from pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens constantly too!

I saw the charge and called their customer service right away (canceled my card too, don’t worry) and after I explained and they saw that the order was set to ship to Arkansas even though I’m in Illinois, they dropped the charge.

I’ve used them to get flea and tick meds with two different vets now and I’ve never gotten a message about vets approving slowly. The only time I got the message was last month when I ordered food and they were upfront from the start that it would take a lot longer than usual and even gave me the option to cancel the order, 24 hours after it was placed, and no hoops to jump through. I’ve asked to return a bed that was too big for my dog and they said to donate it, which was great since I volunteer at a shelter and also foster. They even sent my dog a hand written birthday card. These things are trivial in the grand scheme of things but for people thinking this is the normal and plan to never use Chewy, just have your own experience before you decide. If my vet can figure out how to autoship her meds in 2 days for a pretty big discounted price without me ever having to make a single phone call, then I’ll consider buying from them instead.\n\n## Comment ID fq0hakr with +4 score by [(wellfuckmylife666, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq0hakr/) (in reply to ID ggdkrq):\nLol I seriously don't trust corporations and I don't think anyone should.\n\n## Comment ID fq02sjz with +5 score by [(BetsMomE, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq02sjz/) (in reply to ID ggdkrq):\nThank you for sharing this.

As someone with stable finances who (normally) shops online somewhat frequently there is just no reason for my card to ever decline. Every time I go to Chewy’s site to manually get them to run it again, I don’t have to provide any additional information and it will immediately work. I have been surprised by how illogical it is for them to not just try to run the card again if there’s a processing issue/problem connecting with the bank. Reading this has admittedly made me somewhat suspicious that this is a tactic to delay order processing. \n\nTo be honest it won’t impact my use of the service for the time being - before we were unable to pick up prescription food from our dog’s dermatologist because of our hours v. theirs, and now because our local government has asked us to avoid going anywhere we have to drive + we’re minimizing contact with people. We may have to look into whether another site carries our dogs’ prescriptions though.

I worked there for 2.5 years in their main customer service location as a customer service representative.\n\nYou are absolutely right, the RX team is awful. As a rep, we all hated having to assist that team, and when they launched their pharmacy with actual meds instead of just prescription food, it was a literal shit-show. A lot of departments at Chewy are run by younger people with little experience, with most management being between 20 and 30. [I'm in this bracket, so I'm not saying this was a bad thing, just maybe needed a few seaaoned managers]\n\nThe approval process is so stupid. Customer places order, order gets sent to RX, RX automatically sends a fax (if there's a fax number on file) to the vet. Then it sits in a queue until a person gets to it to make the phone calls to the vet's office. Any emails sent are usually automatic based on time. There used to be email options for the vet diet foods, but with medication, legally it's not valid. The RX team was so small when I was there, and when an angry customer calls in, we would have to reach out to that team to inquire about the status of their order. We as reps couldn't get the approval ourselves (unless it was food) so we couldn't even call the vet for the customer.\n\nIf you ordered on a weekend? Forget it, you'll get a bunch of emails becuase most vets are closed.\n\nChewy was amazing when I started. Then Petsmart bought it, and the 2 guys that created Chewy and their original team got quietly pushed out one by one. I should have left when they did.\n\nI'm sorry for anyone who has had a bad experience with Chewy.

My dog is on special prescription food now, and my vet told me to either go through Chewy or a store like PetSmart because they were out of the food at their practice. I went through Chewy for the first order, and it was all approved by them and my vet within a few hours. However, I'm not surprised my vet recommended them since they're a very small practice and they tend to carry a limited supply of medicines and food.\n\nI'm wondering too if Chewy maybe prioritizes certain practices over others? Like, maybe ones they like are given priority and ones they don't are thrown in the \"if we're falling behind, send a notice that the vet is taking forever\" pile.\n\nOne thing I will say -- I don't understand anyone who would jump to calling up their vet angry about an email, fax, etc. miscommunication.

At the least we either should, or in some states must, provide a written prescription.  I like my clients so if there's a simple way to make that easier, then I do it.  Chewy was annoying but with email, I had an easy way to keep them honest.  Now I don't, so it's provision of a written prescription if the client chooses to go there from here on out.\n\n## Comment ID fq1v95k with +1 score by [(AuntyShaNeNe, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq1v95k/) (in reply to ID ggdkrq):\nAnd this is why I always have my vet fill my pets prescription.

In a small vet office, you're interacting with people and experiencing things with them -- it's easy to empathize (or at least fake it).  To an online shop?

The bigger problem in the US is the pharmaceutical industry in general.  The outrageous costs of human pharmaceuticals has spilled into veterinary medicine. The main reason clients save money on these medications is that the distributors of those medications charge considerably less (sometimes less than half) to larger corporations that sign agreements.

I have never gotten one of those emails from chewy about our prescription food, but now I am wondering if my vet has been barraged with spam on their end because I choose to buy from chewy.

When my friends dog passed away and she contacted them to cancel her standing order, not only did that cancel it, but a few days later she received and card and flowers. And I’ve seen articles online where others have had similar experiences with receiving flowers and even painted artwork of their fur baby that passed away. \n\nAnd my experience with their customers service has been great. When I bought a harness that was too big. I contacted them, they refunded me the money and told me to donate the harness. \n\nI myself don’t use Chewy for medication, I use 1800Pet Meds, it just ends up being cheaper and more convenient then having to drive 20 plus minutes to pick up heartworm prevention from my dogs vet.\n\n## Comment ID fq0rohb with +1 score by [(SexyPileOfShit, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq0rohb/) (in reply to ID ggdkrq):\nI get my prescriptions from my vet.

They answered immediately, clearly not outsourced as it was the least frustrating fraud call I've ever experienced. I assumed this was brand new, today and they hadn't alerted anyone yet. Now I'm concerned they were aware. I'm wondering if their site had a vulnerability, maybe a former IT employee or pen tester (they test sites for penetration vulnerability, can be hired or freelance going off bug bounties), even a hacker. \n\nWhen white hat (good guy) hackers find vulnerabilities, they'll report it to the site, sometimes they'll earn a \"bug bounty\", like 'hey I found this, your IT Dept should repair it, I just saved you $$$, pay me for it').  On the other hand, someone could have found it, reported it, it wasn't acknowledged the way they felt they deserved, and they reposted the vulnerability for others to expose. And then there are the hackers who don't even try to report it, they just try to sell the vulnerability. It could be any number of things, but Chewy definitely needs to warn people and get ahead of it before the concealment ruins their customer trust reputation.\n\n## Comment ID i9i7ucl with +2 score by [(tessabelle227, Reddit, 2022-05-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/tg0non/chewy_hack/i9i7ucl/) (in reply to ID tg0non):\nSame thing happened to me today. $70 order for dog food to an address in Florida.

So it looks like from the age of these other posts that Chewy hasn’t beefed up any security measures. Same as most others - bogus order with items I don’t typically buy. My debit card was linked to my account. Someone changed the email address and shipping address on the account. I was notified that my order was shipping and that I needed to update my credit card. I checked my account and there was a $78 charge pending. I called Chewy right away.  They cancelled the order immediately and it fell off of my account instantly. They removed my credit card info and I called my bank to cancel my card. Sorry, Chewy.

For some reason decided to click on it and discovered it was a $150 order for carpet cleaner going to someone in Florida. Cancelled the order and verified it was reversed on my linked payment method (was still pending). Looked in my saved addresses on Chewy and found the Florida address plus another in Indiana, which does not appear to have ever been used.

Four random pet plushy toys were ordered and the order summary emailed to my wife, plus an earlier email noting that the account's email had been changed (to my wife's).\n\nThe fun wrinkle is: we do not have a Chewy account.\n\nBy studying the emails my wife got, and then calling Chewy customer service and talking to Noah, who was genuinely apologetic, I think the theory explained below (fraudulent seller working with compromised Chewy accounts) is maybe correct.\n\nSomeone's real Chewy account with a weak password becomes compromised by hacker.  Hacker changes the email address (and maybe shipping address) on the account, and then places orders for random stuff.  This is charged to the original account owner's PayPal / credit card.\n\nThe shipping address person is perhaps innocent, and the original account owner as well.\n\nBut what I'm unsure of is: I don't think Chewy supports 3rd party sellers (unlike Amazon).  So how does the hacker make $$$ out of this?\n\nSeparately, I noticed that the embedded links in the Chewy email do not use https, which is insecure.  Two strikes :)\n\n### Comment ID iq5swdy with +1 score by [(q_gurl, Reddit, 2022-09-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/tg0non/chewy_hack/iq5swdy/) (in reply to ID ibaobn8):\nThat is the theory I am going with also.

They placed two $45 orders for the same 2 Items (Treats + Dog Food) and shipped to separate addresses in Saint Joseph, MO and Belton, TX. They paid via PayPal.\n\nInterestingly, they put my street address in the first line of the addresses and the actual delivery address in line 2 as:\n\n        FirstName LastName\n        1234 My Street\n        5678 Fraud Address\n        Fraud City, AA 00000\n\nMy guess is that the people receiving the scam orders are mules who signed up for a work-from-home scam job and the fraudsters are using them to unknowingly receive and re-ship the orders to the actual fraudsters. It may be related to a shady site, but I don't think the scammers are straight drop shipping since so many people are having identical scam orders sent to different addresses.My Chewy password was an old weak one that I have mostly stopped using, so I'm sure it was in a previous data breach. They also changed the email and pw for my account, but I still got order confirmations from both Chewy and PayPal. Chewy customer support was great and canceled the orders. It seems weird that PayPal is the preferred payment method, my guess is that the backend fraud checks for separate billing/shipping addresses is weaker with PayPal than with the stored credit cards, so more fake orders are getting through when they use PayPal.\n\n### Comment ID ici93hh with +2 score by [(OkSheepherder6676, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/tg0non/chewy_hack/ici93hh/) (in reply to ID icdcbzk):\ncorrect. when orders are paid with paypal, we don’t receive any billing address info in our system. 9 times out of 10 it bypasses our fraud prevention system unless the hacker is using a VPN, among a few other factors\n\n### Comment ID idim29l with +2 score by [(softerthings, Reddit, 2022-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/tg0non/chewy_hack/idim29l/) (in reply to ID icdcbzk):\nI noticed the same address set up.

Got hacked around 2am CT a week ago; they placed 4 orders to different addresses (FL, CA, MI, and GA), each for 1-2 bags of dog food, using a credit card I had on file (and had recently used for an order). They kept my name for the shipping addresses, but changed the email and password to my account after the orders were placed so I couldn't log in.  Customer Service was super helpful and was able to cancel 3 of the orders; unfortunately one was literally being boxed and shipped as we were talking, so that one she refunded me and tried to put a cancel on the delivery.  I deleted payment methods and changed my password.  Interestingly, however, a week later I got two emails (within minutes of each other) telling me that my account had suspicious activity and they suspended my account, and I should call them to verify my account and get it reinstated.  I did that, and they were super efficient and friendly, but I have to wonder what kind of activity happened again?!?

The scammer changed my email, Chewy was able to put my email back, but my account is still disabled. Chewy said something about fraud department.\n\nHow long did it take for others accounts to be usable? I actually need dog food soon and don't really want to order dog food from Amazon.\n\nAlso, the theory about a fake pet store makes some sense. I looked up the guy who ordered from my Paypal, and he is 78 years old, don't really think he would know how to scam, but you never know. I am thinking of  reporting it to online fraud, maybe they can look into it further. He ordered \"Gentle Giants Canine Nutrition Chicken Dry Dog Food, 30-lb bag\" and some other stuff the emails won't show, and I found a bunch of ebay listings for it. So somewhere there is a list of chewy usernames and passwords circulating. Even if someone hasn't been hacked I would change your password asap.\n\n## Comment ID idv94wb with +2 score by [(S1DC, Reddit, 2022-06-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/tg0non/chewy_hack/idv94wb/) (in reply to ID tg0non):\nThis just happened to my ex-neighbor.

They were freaked out when something actually showed up. Whats weird is, there was no packing slip in the box. I sort of suspect more than one was delivered and they took the rest? But I dunno. Very strange. My neighbor tried to check Chewy via customer service for an account she forgot about, but none existed.

You have to go into your PayPal and look to see if Chewy is listed there.   People pay bills with \"reoccurring payments\" and 2 factor doesn't seem to apply to retailers/sites that are listed.  Payments will sail through.  [https://www.paypal.com/c2/smarthelp/article/FAQ2254](https://www.paypal.com/c2/smarthelp/article/FAQ2254)\n\nI think that's what's going on with people here.

I immediately called Chewy customer service and the rep said the order was pending so she could quickly and easily cancel it and remove my payment information (I use a card not PayPal when making Chewy orders) then do a password reset. I was nervous this person took down my personal info but so far the only charge on my card is the pending Chewy one that should be gone in a couple days due to cancellation, so hopefully this person just tried for some free dog food that she’ll never receive on my dime. I was hoping she didn’t have my card or contact info just somehow access to my account, unfortunately!

Now all these comments got me thinking and right before this happened, I was in the market for dog food. Checked Chewy and checked Amazon like I usually do. Noticed a 3rd party seller was selling the food for like, $7 dollars cheaper than everywhere else. Went ahead and purchased it through that seller.\n\nWhen it showed up, it had a totally random name on it, but my address. I thought it was just an error with Amazon...but then this happened a week later. Like others have said, inbox was filled with spam emails and I missed the receipt initially but caught the tracking.\n\nI'm going to echo what someone else said on this thread -- both those receiving the packages and those getting charged might be victims -- 3rd party sellers are somehow gaining access to Chewy accounts, pocketing the money for the items they're reselling, and charging the Chewy accounts full price.\n\n**Did anyone else recently purchase something from a 3rd party seller, on Amazon or elsewhere, and have this happen? A quick check of the seller now reveals similar issues with other people's products being \"stopped in transit and returned to seller\" which is exactly what's going to happen to the person who purchased the products charged to my Chewy account.**\n\n## Comment ID ib115ka with +1 score by [(jvjamie1994, Reddit, 2022-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/tg0non/chewy_hack/ib115ka/) (in reply to ID tg0non):\nJust happened to me as well...

I had to call two days later and then spoke to someone who in turn THEN released the order. I asked them \"why doesn't your Fraud Dept. look at the order? It's a product I always buy and the name/address and pet name are the same?  Then last night, I received an email from Chewy stating the flea/tick preventative I ordered was flagged for fraud. I called c/s and she said she would contact her supervisor and the fraud department, but the item won't ship until later in the week. \n\nI realize Chewy is trying to be proactive here, but something isn't adding up.

      "# Post ID 251vq0: First attempt at making homemade pasta turned out very chewy with +49 score by [(jglyum, Reddit, 2014-05-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/251vq0/first_attempt_at_making_homemade_pasta_turned_out/)\nHi there, longtime lurker, new poster. I tried this recipe last night, and didn't think to take pictures.  \nI made a basic homemade pasta from the Pioneer Woman's blog (2 eggs + 1 c flour, portion up as needed: [here](http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2009/05/homemade-pasta/)). I kneaded the dough for a while, by hand, then rolled it out by hand (with a rolling pin, no pasta machine). Then cut it up with a pizza cutter into strips. It was still 1/16-1/8 inch thick and was springing back very slowly a little. I ended up boiling it for 5 minutes instead of the recipe's 2 min, because it was thick and chewy, but I don't think that helped as much. Here are my questions:  \n\n* Did I need to knead for longer? The dough was relatively smooth-looking, although it seemed a little hard to fold it over and smooth that back into the dough. I was worried it was too dry. Did that mean I should have kneaded a lot longer? It's not possible to overknead by hand, right?  \n\n* Was I supposed to let the dough rest before rolling it out? The recipe didn't really mention anything about resting the dough (or I missed that step).  \n\n* Should I have stuck to only 2 minutes of boiling? Did I possibly overboil the pasta?  \n\nI know you can get much better, more consistent results with a pasta machine, but I don't have a kitchen aid or pasta implements or much kitchen space, so I'm not looking to get that at this time. I just wanted to go for something rustic and \"simple,\" similar to the pictures in the blog post.  \nAlso, I know this is off-topic, but if anyone has recommends for recipes/blogs that take this backwoods approach to pasta (few ingredients, no pasta-specific implements), I'd be interested in checking it out. I wanted to try gnocchi, too, and I did it once in college with my friends and that was very un-gnocchi-like.  \nEdit: formatting.\n\n## Comment ID chcvst9 with +15 score by [(None, Reddit, 2014-05-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/251vq0/first_attempt_at_making_homemade_pasta_turned_out/chcvst9/) (in reply to ID 251vq0):\nHow long did you let the pasta sit after kneading? You need to give it a good rest of about 30-60 minutes, and you absolutely need to roll it out thinner. Both a nonexistent rest and too thick of a roll will give you chewy pasta. I don't have a pasta machine either (home cook, not a chef) but I portion them small and roll out by hand very, very thin. \n\nA [french rolling pin](http://www.amazon.com/Ateco-20-Inch-Length-French-Rolling/dp/B000KESQ1G) is highly recommended, IMO, over the typical ones with a rolling barrel and 2 handles on the end. I've found it's much, much easier to use and to control.\n\nAlso, oil. If there's no oil in the recipe you followed, find another one. I've found it's imperative to good (and still simple) homemade pasta. It's only a small bit, but it makes a difference.\n\n### Comment ID chd6bsy with +9 score by [(lachlanhunt, Reddit, 2014-05-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/251vq0/first_attempt_at_making_homemade_pasta_turned_out/chd6bsy/) (in reply to ID chcvst9):\nI have never used oil in fresh pasta.

You should avoid stretching the dough, however. Heel of your hand into the dough, turn, repeat, folding it over onto itself as appropriate. Pay attention to how the dough feels and don't be afraid to give it some time to rest, it does no bad things and often can do good things.\n\n### Comment ID chd5syk with +2 score by [(jglyum, Reddit, 2014-05-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/251vq0/first_attempt_at_making_homemade_pasta_turned_out/chd5syk/) (in reply to ID chczkl0):\nI'm just using regular store-bought flour (not cake, not wheat or some other special naming).

It has nothing to do with the protein content of the flour (if you hear somebody saying that all Tipo 00 flour has a low protein content, you should take all of their subsequent \"tips\" with a grain of salt), rather the amount of bran/germ in the flour. Usually this correlates to the fineness of the mill, as well. The point here is that for an equal weight or volume of Tipo 00 flour versus standard king arthur flour, you don't need quite as much water as it's more absorbent. Other than that it's not going to differ too much versus whatever other mill of flour you might use.\n\nThen, the protein content of your flour determines how \"strong\" the noodle is and also how resilient the dough is. If you use bread flour, you're going to run into an issue where the dough starts to tighten and seize up eventually as you work it. For this reason you want to make sure your dough is rested and stretchable before you cut it. On the flip side if you use cake flour you'll get a dough with relatively little elasticity, and a noodle wihout much \"chew\" or \"bite\" to it.\n\nMy flour mix is generally AP flour and durum or semolina (which in addition to being high protein/gluten flours also impart some color). I'll use 50/50 for a fettucine or linguine (which I prefer al dente, with some bite to it), and 75/25 in favor of the AP for filled pastas like ravioli, where I want the noodle to be tender.\n\nLast but not least, if you insist on using volume-based measurements for dough, use 1 cup of flour per 2 eggs. However I'd strongly recommend that you start using weight-based measurements for anything where you're combing water and flour. In this case, you want a 3:2 flour-to-liquid ratio. I don't use olive oil in my dough but if you choose to use some, just include it as a liquid, and keep the ratio the same.\n\nTL;DR rest your dough, use weight-based measurements, different types of flour will give you different qualities in your pasta.\n\n#### Comment ID chd73da with +3 score by [(getjustin, Reddit, 2014-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/251vq0/first_attempt_at_making_homemade_pasta_turned_out/chd73da/) (in reply to ID chd5syk):\nThis is probably your problem.

This is the recipe I use for pasta that works every time:\n\n\n* 100g of flour\n* one egg (~50g without shell).\n* A few drops of water as needed if the mixture is too dry. This happens if the egg is a bit smaller than average\n\nThat makes approximately one serving of pasta for an adult male. Scale as needed.\n\n1 cup of flour is around 150g, but cups are very imprecise for flour and it varies greatly. I'd say the ratio of egg to flour was too much in your mixture.\n\n### Comment ID chdch5q with +1 score by [(MrT3R, Reddit, 2014-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/251vq0/first_attempt_at_making_homemade_pasta_turned_out/chdch5q/) (in reply to ID chd6qwf):\nWhat kind of flour?\n\n#### Comment ID chdfbxc with +1 score by [(The_Esprit_Descalier, Reddit, 2014-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/251vq0/first_attempt_at_making_homemade_pasta_turned_out/chdfbxc/) (in reply to ID chdch5q):\nDurum semolina\n\n## Comment ID chdi5ab with +2 score by [(jetpackmalfunction, Reddit, 2014-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/251vq0/first_attempt_at_making_homemade_pasta_turned_out/chdi5ab/) (in reply to ID 251vq0):\nCooking time will vary based on thickness and how you cut the pasta (eg. thin spaghetti vs wider noodles). I'd recommend boiling it for a couple of minutes, and then tasting a piece each minute (rinse it briefly under cold water first, if you don't want to burn your mouth) until it's al dente. That blog recommends 2 minutes, but it may end up being 5 or more.\n\nI've been experimenting with gnocchi lately. First attempt was with boiled potatoes, a potato masher, equal amounts of flour and potatoes, plus salt, pepper, and parmesan. It ended up quite doughy, not at all what I wanted. Apparently that was a consequence of over-working the dough, and using too much flour. I've since picked up a potato ricer, which does a great job of getting the cooked potatoes to that fluffy consistency you want with minimal working compared to a masher. Ricers can be a bit expensive though, so look around for a cheaper one or a second-hand one. Most recipes recommend baking the potatoes, but I've been steaming them - less hassle than scooping them out of dirty skins while they burn your fingers. Boiling apparently results in them becoming too waterlogged, which is a Bad Thing for your gnocchi. [This article](http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jul/10/how-to-make-the-perfect-gnocchi), plus a whole bunch of other blog posts, recommend using quite a low ratio of flour compared to your potatoes.\n\nMy most recent and so far best gnocchi used I think 700g peeled, steamed, riced, still-hot potatoes, 2 beaten eggs, maybe 200g flour, and a little salt. I very gently combined them all into a dough - no kneading - and then portioned and rolled the dough out into sausages, chopped them up, and boiled them. I've also tried sauteeing the gnocchi after boiling them, and that came out really awesomely with a nice golden crust, but usually by the time I've made the gnocchi and sauce and cooked it, I can't be bothered with that extra step.\n\n### Comment ID chdnimi with +2 score by [(jglyum, Reddit, 2014-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/251vq0/first_attempt_at_making_homemade_pasta_turned_out/chdnimi/) (in reply to ID chdi5ab):\nThanks for all of these gnocchi tips!

You obviously want more dough than that, so do 4 cups of flour + 4 eggs + 4 small pinches salt + 4 half egg shells full water.\n\nKnead this together in a bowl until its a doughy mass (about 10-15 minutes).  I use a pasta machine for the rest of the process, but its easy to accomplish without it.  Take the ball out and divide it into even segments (for the 4 cups flour amount, I cut the ball into quarters, then cut those balls into quarters, so you end up with 16 small balls of dough).  The key now is to roll them out as thin as possible into long sheets without them falling apart.  A pasta machine is great because it allows you to incrementally thin the sheet, but rolling it out will work fine.  Make sure you've got lots of flour on the counter top or whatever you are rolling it out on.  Once youve got thin sheets, cut them into whatever shape you'd like, dry for a while on a baking sheet or hang on a line of cooking twine, and youre done!\n\n### Comment ID chd5wiz with +1 score by [(jglyum, Reddit, 2014-05-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/251vq0/first_attempt_at_making_homemade_pasta_turned_out/chd5wiz/) (in reply to ID chcy4vc):\nI made 1 c flour + 2 eggs for pasta for 2 people last night, with salad, etc. How many servings does your 4c + 4eggs etc recipe make?

Just boil then mash potatoes and add oil and flour and any seasonings you want. Some recipes call for egg but I normally leave it out so they're vegan. No need to measure, just add flour until you get a dough.\n\nIt really might have been that the dough was too thick. I have had chewy, thick pasta before and now that I use a machine it doesn't happen. I got my pasta maker for about $20 at Ross and it's not big. I keep it in a cabinet. It's really so much easier and you get much better pasta because it would be extremely difficult to roll it out that thin by hand.\n\n### Comment ID chd6093 with +1 score by [(jglyum, Reddit, 2014-05-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/251vq0/first_attempt_at_making_homemade_pasta_turned_out/chd6093/) (in reply to ID chd42oc):\nThanks for the gnocchi tips.

Everything looks good, but i wanted to see how they fare compared to Trupanion? I know they are backed by trupanion, however, what are the differences? I see they have an annual deductible and the complete plan covers exam visits, etc. and works with trupanion direct pay which is nice. My concern is do they also not increase premiums as pets age? Also, since it’s newer, I don’t have any concern about Chewy going under, but how likely would it be for CarePlus to go under or sell? Don’t want to be in a position where they cancel coverage and I can hypothetically be stuck with pre-existing conditions. Hoping since it would be backed by trupanion, they will still honor it. \n\n## Comment ID lcqdugo with +3 score by [(peachcobb, Reddit, 2024-07-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/petinsurancereviews/comments/1e0oo18/thoughts_on_chewy_careplus/lcqdugo/) (in reply to ID 1e0oo18):\nI have the chewy plus on my cats.

For example, I’m in CA and I can only purchase a Lemonade policy through Chewy. Other states you can only purchase a Trupanion policy, it’s very confusing. \n\nAs you’ve noted, the main difference is the annual deductible and exam fee coverage. Chewy also has the 24/7 vet line you can call to get help if needed. Going through Chewy does mean for prescriptions and prescription food they have you go through Chewy for full reimbursement. \n\nNow as to raising premiums, I can almost guarantee premiums are going to rise throughout the life of the policy. How much? I have no idea. Even if Chewy and Trupanion both swear up and down they don’t raise rates due to the aging of your pet, they will find other reasons including inflation, more people making more expensive claims, cost of doing business, etc etc. But that seems to be par for the course in insurance. My health insurance, car insurance, and so on have all risen steadily. Pet insurance is bound to do the same. \n\nIn my opinion you are taking a bit of a risk going through Chewy rather than Trupanion. Chewy has not been in the pet insurance game very long and so they don’t have that stability that others may have. They may decide they don’t like being in the pet insurance field, they may decide they don’t like the companies they are working with, and so on. It wasn’t long ago they only offered Trupanion, now they have Lemonade and Trupanion. What if tomorrow they drop one or the other? Or Lemonade or Trupanion decline to keep working with Chewy? That could leave you in a more precarious position. Basically you have a whole other company that is between you and your insurer. They can make decisions on your behalf that you may not like. \n\nBecause pet insurance isn’t heavily regulated, it can leave customers in the lurch, with pre existing conditions and so on, with no legal penalties. So it is worth thinking about, are the benefits of purchasing through Chewy worth the potential risk if they withdraw or change in the future? If Trupanion and Chewy part ways it will be entirely up to Trupanion to extend coverage to you. But they are under no obligation legally to cover what are now pre existing conditions. Will they? Unknown. \n\nGenerally it is advised to wait a minimum of 5 years for a new insurance company to ‘settle’ and make sure they are stable and able to service claims. Chewy is not offering it’s own policies, but I would still be skeptical of them until they get more time under their belt. They launched in 2022 I think and already made a significant change in CA, dropping Trupanion entirely. I don’t know what happened to people who had Trupanion through Chewy in CA.\n\n### Comment ID lcpiqtw with +2 score by [(MarillaV, Reddit, 2024-07-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/petinsurancereviews/comments/1e0oo18/thoughts_on_chewy_careplus/lcpiqtw/) (in reply to ID lcpgvof):\nOh and I forgot to say, you say moving your dogs to Chewy, so are they on another insurance plan right now? Before you move them I would double check for any pre existing concerns. Please please obtain your vet records and make sure nothing has been noted that you are unaware of, like tartar build up, itchy skin, watery eyes, etc. These can all be used to deny future claims. It’s worth a look! Even if you decide to move the dogs anyway, you won’t get a nasty surprise later.",

They said to let them know how much my vet wants to walk in and get the prescription.\n\n## Comment ID ihd7mkp with +2 score by [(BeazleyBo, Reddit, 2022-07-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/bblp08/any_issues_with_chewycom_prescriptions/ihd7mkp/) (in reply to ID bblp08):\nStorage and shipping temperature of drugs matters because temps too high or too low can cause the quality and effectiveness of the medicine to be compromised.  \n\nSome medication ,  such as heart worm medicine is temperature sensitive (it even says so right on the packaging)  and if a pet pharmacy does not ship medications in an appropriate temperature controlled box, then a beloved pet can be adversely affected.  For example, the heartworm medication could be ineffective at preventing heartworms.\n\n## Comment ID ekjlmgo with +4 score by [(Laserguy74, Reddit, 2019-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/bblp08/any_issues_with_chewycom_prescriptions/ekjlmgo/) (in reply to ID bblp08):\nMy Mom and Dad have used Chewy for everything for a long time. They haven’t had any issues.\n\n## Comment ID ekjwqzy with +3 score by [(mooiee, Reddit, 2019-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/bblp08/any_issues_with_chewycom_prescriptions/ekjwqzy/) (in reply to ID bblp08):\nMy parents use chewy for flea meds and prescription diabetic food for their cat.  They love it and haven’t had any problems. I think your vet is probably a bit upset that your money will be going through Chewy and not their office."

Again, the store itself is fine, but the interface is frustrating and terrible. People have also been talking about how good their customer service is in their reviews, but I’ve never once been helped by their chatbot-based support system. Forth example, when I told them that their system was recommending discontinued items, chatbot’s response “we have never had this issue reported before.” Oh really?

The latest version of your app has basically rendered the app useless to screen reader user, such as myself. In the past, I have been able to use the app without any issues. However, now it is impossible for me to search for items, get details on items, add items to my basket without calling your customer service phone number. This is something I prefer not to do. per the ADA, your app needs to be made accessible for all users, no matter the disability. Your customer care team has been wonderful, but. my having to call customer care to look for items and place an order does not put me on equal footing with everyone else. Could the developers, please, please look into fixing the accessibility problems with the app?",

We recently lost 2 dogs, Daisy that was 15-1/2 years old and Domino unexpectedly at only 5 years old with kidney disease told to us by the ER vet from ingesting antifreeze as a puppy prior to us rescuing him. Both losses were devastating to us as these rescues are our children. Chewy was so kind as to send an email with their condolences. I was very touched by that and cried again. Once when I lost my 15 year old cat Oliver, they sent a dozen of the most beautiful roses I have ever seen! I cried then too. And they also sent me a Chewy ball cap and tennis ball for the pups as a thank you! Granted I do spend a lot at Chewy due to all our rescues, but they do not have to do all these extras. They are the only company I have dealt with that let’s you know they truly appreciate your business. So a HUGE THANK YOU TO CHEWY and God bless you always!  We love you!",

It's essentially going through a bit of 'workload inflation\" where the scope you are expected to take on within your level or job class is increasing. It's definitely a good thing long term - in other words, 5 years from now, we won't suffer from the leadership bloat that affects many business. However, while living through it, it can be tough to get promoted, or get members of your team promoted, even if you or they have greatly increased scope over several years, given that that simply has become the new expectation and standard. It's not a con for the business, and new team members coming in might not even notice, but it's felt internally. The good news buried inside of this con is that you will get an opportunity to take on more scope that you otherwise might have, and it's a good forcing function to growing your remit, learning more about the business, and getting increased exposure.",

In all my years at Chewy, I have yet to see a decision get made, or a process roll that I didn't feel was generally in the best interest of team members and the long term success of the company.

It's essentially going through a bit of 'workload inflation\" where the scope you are expected to take on within your level or job class is increasing. It's definitely a good thing long term - in other words, 5 years from now, we won't suffer from the leadership bloat that affects many business. However, while living through it, it can be tough to get promoted, or get members of your team promoted, even if you or they have greatly increased scope over several years, given that that simply has become the new expectation and standard. It's not a con for the business, and new team members coming in might not even notice, but it's felt internally. The good news buried inside of this con is that you will get an opportunity to take on more scope that you otherwise might have, and it's a good forcing function to growing your remit, learning more about the business, and getting increased exposure.",

In all my years at Chewy, I have yet to see a decision get made, or a process roll that I didn't feel was generally in the best interest of team members and the long term success of the company.

      "# [Chewy grows net sales 4.8% in Q3 earnings results by Kevin Williams, Mary Meisenzahl, Bloomberg News on 2024-12-06](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/chewy-quarterly-sales/)\nChewy, Inc., the pet food and supplies retailer, continued to show growth in its latest quarterly earnings, achieving a 4.8% year-over-year increase in Q3 net sales, which totaled $2.88 billion.\n\nThe company has seen consistent year-over-year growth in its online sales, even as rates of growth have fallen.\n\nCurrently, Chewy is No. 10 in the Top 1000, which is Digital Commerce 360’s database ranking North America’s largest online retailers by their annual web sales. In the Top 1000, Digital Commerce 360 categorizes Chewy as a Specialty retailer. Digital Commerce 360 projects that Chewy online sales will close out 2024 at $11.59 billion.\n\nChewy web sales by year\n\nChewy quarterly sales highlights in Q3\n\nChewy’s CEO lauded the earnings report.\n\n“Our third quarter results continued to build on the positive momentum we observed in Q2,” said Sumit Singh, Chewy’s CEO. “These results underscore the durability of our business model and our team’s relentless focus on high-quality execution and operational discipline.”\n\nAside from net sales figures, the company also reported the following:\n\nGross margin of 29.3% increased 80 basis points year over year\n\nNet income of $3.9 million, including share-based compensation expense and related taxes of $80.4 million\n\nAdjusted EBITDA of $138.2 million, an increase of $55.7 million year over year\n\nAdjusted net income of $84.9 million, an increase of $21.5 million year over year\n\nAreas of business growth for Chewy\n\nThe company’s auto-ship program (which sends pet food to regular customers on a schedule) has helped drive growth. Revenue from auto-ship was $2.3 million compared with $2.1 million during Q3 last year.\n\nIn an earnings call, Singh also pointed to the growth in the company’s clinics, Chewy Vet Care.\n\n“Performance across our clinic footprint is promising,” Singh said\n\nHe added that the clinics are helping to acquire new customers and funnel them into the Chewy ecosystem.\n\n“Broader ecosystem benefits, including cross-category shopping and post-clinic visit purchases on chewy.com, have strengthened since last quarter, indicating that our ability to seamlessly connect care with commerce is resonating with pet parents,” he explained.\n\nChewy’s success and expectations\n\nRetail experts were more restrained in their praise of Chewy.\n\nMichael Nemeroff, ecommerce expert and CEO and co-founder of RushOrderTees, told Digital Commerce 360 that Chewy has trained investors to expect big profits.\n\n“Chewy is doing well with building consistent revenue growth, but their share value has actually dropped over the past few days because ‘good enough’ is no longer good enough,” Nemeroff assessed, adding that investors expect big growth in retail, but a 5% improvement doesn’t “wow” them. Nevertheless, Nemeroff said, projections of 13% growth from Chewy in the current quarter remained promising.\n\n“Chewy has built a loyal customer base but faces competition from giants like Amazon,” he stated. “If they can find a way to manage costs and offer better value than price leaders, they’ll continue to stand out and increase their following even further.”\n\nChallenges ahead for Chewy\n\nMichael Zakkour, a retail-focused founder and chief strategist at the retail consultancy 5 New Digital, pointed out that the number of active customers declined by 0.5% to 20.2 million, while operating expenses rose by 3.3% year over year to $818.2 million.\n\n“Despite the mixed results, I am forecasting healthy growth for the company in 2025, driven by several factors, including its commitment to adding services,” Zakkour said, citing the “Connect With a Vet” and insurance plans; the strength of its subscription model, “Autoship”; and the pet care digital commerce segment growing at a 12% compound annual growth rate.\n\nZakkour says Chewy will continue to have to innovate and evolve to fend off rivals.\n\n“While Chewy is the market leader in pet care ecommerce, PetSmart and Amazon have stepped up their investment and focus on ecommerce, so Chewy will need to adjust to a more competitive landscape,” Zakkour said, pointing to the decrease in customers as a possible red flag.\n\n“Chewy needs to improve customer retention rates and decrease operating expenses, as reflected in its earnings report,” Zakkour says.\n\nPercentage changes may not align exactly with dollar figures due to rounding.

      "# [Chewy (company) by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2016-08-12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewy_(company))\nInternet retailer of pet items\n\nThis article is about the pet food retailer. For other uses, see Chewy.\n\nChewy, Inc. is an American online retailer of pet food and other pet-related products based in Plantation, Florida. Chewy went public in 2019 with the ticker symbol CHWY on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\n2011–2019: Founding, acquisition and pre-IPO\n\n[edit]\n\nChewy was founded under the name \"Mr. Chewy\" in June 2011 by Ryan Cohen[3] and Michael Day.[4] In March 2012, the company estimated a total yearly revenue of $26 million, despite losing money in its first half year.[4][5] By 2017, the company had revenue of approximately $2 billion and 51% of online pet food sales in the US.[6][7] At that time, CEO Ryan Cohen prepared to take Chewy public as both Petco and PetSmart approached with merger offers.[8] Petco's offer would be paid for in part using stock, whereas PetSmart offered an all-cash bid that would also allow Chewy to remain a completely separate business.[9] In 2017, Chewy was purchased by PetSmart, a retail entity backed by private equity firm BC Partners,[10] for $3.35 billion, which at the time was the largest ever acquisition of an e-commerce business.[9]\n\nFollowing the acquisition, Cohen remained CEO and operated the business largely as an independent unit of PetSmart.[11] Between 2017 and 2018, Chewy’s sales increased from $2.1 billion to $3.5 billion,[12] with 66% of sales coming from customers signed up for automatic recurring shipments.[9] Sumit Singh succeeded Ryan Cohen as CEO of Chewy in March 2018.[13]\n\n2019–present: Post-IPO\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2019, Chewy filed an S-1 for an initial public offering, intending to trade under the ticker symbol CHWY. In its filing, Chewy reported a net loss of $268 million on total sales of $3.5 billion for its 2018 fiscal year.[14] In the 2019 fiscal year, Chewy earned net sales of $4.85 billion, a 40 percent year-over-year increase on a 52-week basis. The company saw increased demand from millions of existing and new customers as the business sustained growth throughout the economic disruption of the COVID-19 era.[15][16]\n\nChewy launched a free tele-triage service called Connect With a Vet in October 2020.[17] In November 2020, Chewy announced that it would produce and fulfill orders of customized prescription medications, commonly referred to as compounding, for instances where commercial alternatives are absent.[18] In 2020, it was announced that Chewy and PetSmart would split to operate as separate companies.[19]\n\nIn March 2021, Chewy reported revenue of $2.04 billion for Q4 of 2020, making it Chewy's first quarter of net profitability, and net sales of $7.15 billion for the fiscal year.[20][21] In March 2022, Chewy reported net sales of $8.89 billion for the 2021 fiscal year.[22]\n\nIn August 2022, Chewy announced the introduction of the CarePlus program, which provides pet insurance and wellness plans. This initiative marked Chewy's entry into the health insurance sector for pets.[23]\n\nIn the 2022 fiscal year, Chewy's net sales grew 13.6% since 2021, to $10.1 billion.[24] Following this, in December 2023, Chewy expanded its healthcare services by launching Chewy Vet Care. This service includes the establishment of veterinary practices that offer routine check-ups, urgent care, and surgical procedures.[25]\n\nIn fiscal year 2023, Chewy reported net sales of $11.15 billion representing 10.2% year-over-year growth primarily driven by increased spending from both new and existing customers, strength of Chewy's Autoship subscription program and growth of Chewy's pet healthcare business.[26]\n\nCorporate affairs\n\n[edit]\n\nThe company's founder and first CEO, Ryan Cohen, stated that he used Jeff Bezos's 1997 letter to shareholders as a roadmap for how to grow Chewy by using Amazon's guidelines on the convenience of shopping online and customer service.[27] Cohen stepped down in March 2018,[28] and Sumit Singh was named the company's CEO in March 2018 after working as its COO since 2017 and previously as an executive at Dell and Amazon.[29][30][31][32] Singh led the company through its IPO; Chewy grew to a market capitalization of $40 billion. The company reported to have employed around 7,000 people in the United States in 2018 and more than 12,000 by 2019.[33][34] The company has more than 18,000 employees in the United States as of 2021.[35] Chewy is chaired by Raymond Svider of BC Partners. The private equity firm continues to own around 80 percent of Chewy following the latter's IPO, representing 98 percent of the voting power.[36]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]",
      "# [CARE for Pets™ on 2017-01-17](https://www.pets.care/medications/)\nStudy conducted by CARE for Pets™ reveals many veterinary consolidators communicate misleading statements about ownership information on their individual practice websites which is most likely to create a false impression to pet owners that the practice is independently owned and locally operated. Most veterinary practices acquired by corporate consolidators often retain their original company name and may purposely avoid corporate ownership identification -- hide ownership.\n\nIs Your 'Local' Animal Hospital Corporate-Owned?\n\nCOMMON PERCEPTIONS ABOUT CORPORATE PRACTICES\n\nThere is a common perception in the pet care industry that many corporate-owned veterinary practices prioritize profits over patient care -- doctors feel more pressure to generate revenue and see more clients per shift. A common strategy for consolidators is to increase revenue by raising prices after an acquisition -- increase in upselling to clients. Studies in human medicine show that private equity takeovers are linked to rising costs for patients and sinking quality of care. Understanding private equity investments in human medicine will provide insight into its potential impact to veterinary medicine.\n\nCommon Perceptions of Corporate Veterinary Practices\n\nWHO OWNS, OPERATES AND CONTROLS THE PRACTICE?\n\nCARE for Pets™ officially launches VERIFIED,™ the first and only veterinary practice ownership verification online tool for the pet care industry -- do you know who owns your vet? Consolidators buying hospitals often require the selling doctor to stay at the veterinary practice for 1 to 4 years post-sale and may fail to disclose change of ownership to pet owners -- \"golden handcuffs.\" Advertising is ethical when there are no false, deceptive, or misleading statements or claims.\n\nHEIGHTENED SCRUTINY OF PRIVATE EQUITY M&A DEALS\n\nToday, 3 out of 4 specialty and emergency hospitals in the U.S. are owned by corporate consolidators -- state legislator asks Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to scrutinize closure of emergency hospital. Private equity firms increasingly engage in roll up strategies that allow them to accrue market power off the commission’s radar -- senators urged the FTC and congress to take stronger action against consolidation in the veterinary care industry.\n\nFTC Intervenes PE Acquisition Citing Antitrust Concerns\n\nEXIT-DRIVEN STRATEGY: BUYING UP HOSPITALS TO SELL\n\nRoll-ups, a common strategy for consolidators, buys many veterinary practices and combines them into a larger organization to obtain a higher valuation -- grow rapidly. The entity is typically resold within 3 to 5 years to another consolidator for a substantial profit. Hospital groups sell for 100s of millions of dollars -- many times over $1 billion.\n\nFlipping Hospitals Reap Large Profits for Consolidators\n\nCONSOLIDATORS PRIORITIZING PROFITS OVER PATIENTS\n\nOur research shows that common complaints among employees of corporate-owned veterinary practices say their employers prioritize short-term profits -- numerous red flags. Reading company reviews at popular job websites about the corporate consolidator that owns the individual practice can provide greater insight into the company's true priorities, work conditions, culture, and leadership. However, gag clauses are on the rise which may silence doctors and staff -- stifle public debate about the effects of rapid veterinary consolidation.\n\nCommon Employee Complaints of Veterinary Consolidators\n\nARE CONSOLIDATORS EXACERBATING VET SHORTAGE?\n\nFirst-of-its-kind study reveals that veterinarians working in corporate practices reported feeling more pressure than those in private practice to generate revenue and see more clients per shift. There is a large mismatch between employees' purpose and consolidators -- employees and clients blindsided by abrupt closure of hospital. Consolidators primary focus on profits is negatively impacting the workplace culture -- cause burnout and drives workers away from the profession.\n\nCONSOLIDATORS ENDLESS PURSUIT OF PROFITS\n\nLarge consolidators often make hundreds of millions of dollars a year while many of its employees struggle to earn a livable wage and owners deal with high vet bills -- consolidator launches sale process. The prioritization of profits will continue indefinitely unless workers and consumers pushback.\n\nACCELERATE POSITIVE CHANGE IN PET CARE INDUSTRY\n\nAs \"the internet's most trusted consumer advocate for the pet care industry,\"™ CARE for Pets™ seeks to empower pet owners to effect positive change in the pet care industry in order to provide the best care for all companion animals.\n\nABOUT US | BETTER CARE FOR PETS™ | TRADEMARKS\n\nCopyright © Watchdog Media Group™\n\nAll Rights Reserved 2014-2025",

Gill also mocked up his own version of the standard SEC 13G filing form by adding a section stating he was “not a cat.”\n\nGill shot to fame in 2020 after becoming the de facto leader of an online-populist movement to purchase stocks of legacy brick-and-mortar companies like GameStop, AMC and Bed Bath and Beyond, with the stated goal of attempting to turn the companies around. It didn’t quite work — although the movement did successfully create losses for investors who were actively betting against the companies.\n\nBut his trading has also been the subject of scrutiny.\n\nGill now faces a new class-action lawsuit filed in Brooklyn alleging that his most recent trades in GameStop shares amounted to a \"pump and dump\" scheme.\n\nThe plaintiff, Martin Radev, a Nevada resident, representing a class of other GameStop investors, alleges Gill knowingly used his large and influential platform to \"pump\" up the stock price of the company this year by posting online while failing to reveal he had taken up a new position in the company. Gill then successfully sold his shares for a profit, the lawsuit alleges.\n\nThe price of GameStop shares remains higher than before Gill's post but has declined from its peak by about 50%.\n\nThey were down 5% in Monday trading.\n\nIn a twist, GameStop is now run by Ryan Cohen, who also co-founded Chewy. Cohen helped fuel the meme-stock wave after revealing he had taken a large position in GameStop in 2020, several months after Gill first began posting about his position.\n\nCohen is no longer affiliated with Chewy management, and it is not clear whether he and Gill have any relationship. An attorney for Cohen did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe secretary of state of Massachusetts, where Gill resides, is also investigating the GameStop trade.\n\nGill did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

Chewy beat analysts' sales estimates in its third-quarter results earlier this month, with Chief Executive Sumit Singh noting a sequential increase in active customers. The company, he said in a statement, \"continued to build on the positive momentum\" it saw in the second quarter.\n\nRelated: Keith Gill, aka Roaring Kitty, has dumped his stake in Chewy\n\nChewy's performance has caught the attention of analysts. \"Strong execution & improving industry trends support active customer growth,\" J.P.

Chewy reached 20.2 million active customers in its latest quarter, up 160,000 from the previous quarter, but fell 0.5% year over year.\n\nThe pet retailer’s updated mobile app experience, which emphasized convenience, helped create a mid-teens boost in unique customers and average monthly app users compared to Q3 2023, according to CEO Sumit Singh.\n\nChewy Vet Care, its in-person veterinary clinics, are also showing promise, according to CFO David Reeder. The six existing locations earned high net promoter scores for their customer service, and more than half of new customers who visit clinics shop online after their trip.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nChewy is marrying a better site experience with marketing campaign execution to fuel customer and sales growth. Net sales grew 4.8% year over year in the third quarter, reaching $2.88 billion and exceeding the retailer’s guidance.\n\n“We are continuously rolling out enhancements to our on-site and in-app experiences to ensure we are providing an even more enjoyable and convenient shopping journey for pet parents,” Singh said.\n\nThe company is focusing on connecting its marketing funnel to expanded audiences, according to Singh. Once customers are on the site, Chewy’s improved experience and product assortment can help turn interest into purchases.\n\nThe retailer has improved its ability to identify and segment existing customers to encourage repeat purchases, sign up for automatic shipments and engage with the mobile app. This will be a key part of the company’s 2025 strategy.\n\nThe Chewy+ paid membership program, which offers perks including free returns and 24/7 customer service, is driving sales as well, according to Singh. Chewy+ members place more orders and have greater mobile app engagement than non-members.\n\nThe program, which launched in the summer, is young enough that it only offers an “immaterial” contribution to Chewy’s bottom line, according to Singh. However, Singh is encouraged by the early results and looks forward to expanding the program to a broader audience.\n\n“Overall, we're playing a pretty strong playbook, continuing to differentiate ourselves, both in terms of the basics of the category on price and convenience and assortment, but also in bringing new innovations to life,” Singh said.",
      "# [Why Your Old Dog Won’t Sleep at Night—and What You Can Do About It by Elizabeth Anderson Lopez on 2015-11-16](https://be.chewy.com/help-my-old-dog-wont-sleep-at-night/)\n“Sleep disruptions can be from a variety of causes, often medical in nature,” Dr. Crosby says. “Causes range from gastrointestinal trouble to urinary system infection to early stages of dementia.” Speak with your veterinarian if your pet is suffering from sleep disruption.\n\nNicholas Dodman, BVMS, MRCVS, DACVB, section head and program director of the Animal Behavior Department of Clinical Sciences at the Cummings Veterinary Medical Center at Tufts University in North Grafton, Massachusetts, distills the potential medical issues further into two categories:\n\nCanine cognitive dysfunction (CCD), also commonly known as canine Alzheimer's or dementia\n\nPain\n\nDementia as a Cause of Dog Insomnia\n\n“Just like people, as dogs get older there is an increasing frequency [of dementia],” Dr. Dodman says.\n\nBecause there’s no test for CCD, diagnosis can be tricky. Essentially, it’s a diagnosis of exclusion when other causes have been ruled out, Dr. Dodman says.\n\nA trip to your veterinarian can help determine the cause of your dog’s insomnia and rule out others. This is often accomplished through performing a physical examination, blood work, and a urinalysis, Dr. Crosby says. After those tests have been completed, your vet may recommend more extensive testing.\n\n“You don’t do a bone scan or MRI willy nilly—only after standard tests have been done,” Dr. Dodman says. Your veterinarian will determine which tests are appropriate for your pet.\n\nSymptoms of canine Alzheimer’s, or senility, that affect sleep include restlessness, disorientation, and confusion. And there may be indicators during the day, too, including house soiling, increased anxiety, reduced appetite, weight loss, and lack of energy.\n\nIf a dog does have CCD, pet parents can help improve their dog’s quality of life with diet, medication, supplements, and cognitive enrichments. Unfortunately, there is no cure to CCD, which is one of the parallels to human Alzheimer’s.\n\nPain as a Cause of Dog Insomnia\n\nAnother possible reason for why a senior dog is restless at night is arthritis and pain, especially due to cancer in dogs, which Dr. Dodman says is the most common cause of death in older dogs.\n\n“Tumors swell and grow and push things around,” Dr. Dodman explains.\n\nAnd if a dog is in pain, that pain can be worse at night because there are no distractions, Dr. Dodman says.\n\nDogs who cannot sleep at night because of fear and anxiety may display signs like enlarged pupils, whale eye (where the whites of the dog’s eyes are visible), tucked tails, and drooling.\n\nSleeplessness may also be caused by seizures in dogs. “Seizures are not as well suppressed as they are during the day, and are especially common in old dogs,” Dr. Dodman says.\n\nEnvironmental Causes for Dog Insomnia\n\nAny change in an adult dog’s behavior is cause for concern, says Pat Miller, CBCC-KA, CPDT-KA, director of Peaceable Paws Dog and Puppy Training in Fairplay, Maryland, and should be discussed with a veterinarian. But sometimes, instead of a medical cause for dog insomnia, there could be external factors causing the sleeplessness that can be easily resolved.\n\nIf your senior dog is restless at night, consider any external changes that have occurred, including:\n\nChanges in the household routine\n\nNew noises outside that may be disturbing your dog\n\nNew household members\n\nReduction in your dog's daily exercise/activity level\n\nThose new noises may be seasonal. For example, a loud snowplow can affect your canine’s ability to sleep and lead to your old dog pacing at night, says Dr. Dodman. Another dog was disturbed when their house’s heating system kicked in, causing sleep issues, Dr. Dodman also recalls.\n\nDog Sleep Apnea and Dog Nightmares\n\nDog Sleep Apnea\n\nPeople who suffer from sleep apnea may be inclined to think that their older dog with sleep issues has dog sleep apnea. But this may prove not to be the issue.\n\nSleep apnea doesn’t necessarily occur in older dogs, but it does with brachycephalic dogs—that is, dog breeds with flat faces, like Pugs and Shih Tzus—especially if they’re overweight, Dr. Dodman says. Possible signs of sleep apnea in dogs include snoring, suddenly waking up to gasp for air, and daytime fatigue.\n\nDog Nightmares\n\nSomething else that can affect a dog’s sleep at any age is nightmares. Dr. Dodman says electroencephalograms (EEGs) demonstrate brainwave activity increases during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the dreaming phase of sleep.\n\nDogs with the condition REM behavior disorder (RBD) physically act out what’s going on, instead of dreaming quietly, displaying the symptoms you would expect of a nightmare. Behaviors typically seen with REM sleep behavior disorders include sudden leg movements, growling, barking, and biting.",
      "# [Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Chewy vs. Freshpet by Jeremy Bowman, www.facebook.com on 2024-11-09](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/11/09/best-stock-to-buy-right-now-chewy-vs-freshpet/)\nPets are bigger business than ever.\n\nPet adoptions spiked during the pandemic, and spending on pets has continued thanks to trends like the humanization of pets, with more Americans treating their pets like children.\n\nTwo companies that capitalized on that trend are Chewy (CHWY 3.82%) and Freshpet (FRPT 1.63%). Both stocks have generally delivered strong growth but offer different ways to get exposure to the pet industry. Let's size up both of them in order to determine which is the better buy today.\n\nBusiness model: Chewy vs. Freshpet\n\nChewy is the leading pure-play e-commerce company in the pet industry, and it's built a loyal customer base through its autoship program that sends customers pet food and other products on a regular basis. Chewy also sells a wide range of products, making it easy for customers to use it as a one-stop shop for all of their pet needs.\n\nThe company has about 115,000 stock-keeping units (SKUs) across products and services from 3,500 of the best brands in the pet industry. Its product selection includes pet pharmaceuticals and even pet insurance.\n\nFreshpet, on the other hand, sells fresh, refrigerated pet food. The company is best known for its refrigerated rolls of dog food that are sold in branded refrigerators in supermarkets and pet food stores. It's a premium product, and it's tapped into the desire for pet owners to feed their pets better quality food.\n\nFreshpet has its products in more than 26,000 stores, and it's expanding in the U.S. and abroad, while adding new products.\n\nIt has the leading brand in its category, and its production facilities and branding create barriers to entry as well as a competitive advantage.\n\nBoth companies have strong business models that have given them competitive advantages. Chewy is the clear leader in e-commerce for pet products, while Freshpet dominates in fresh, refrigerated pet food.\n\nFinancials: Chewy vs. Freshpet\n\nIn recent financial results, there's a significant difference between the two companies.\n\nChewy, which was growing rapidly early in its history, especially during the pandemic, has seen growth decelerate significantly in recent quarters. In the second quarter, the company reported just 2.6% revenue growth, reaching $2.86 billion, and its revenue growth has slowed over the last several quarters.\n\nMuch of the pet industry, including rival Petco, faced sluggish growth in the post-pandemic era due to inflationary pressure and a reversal of the pet-spending boom during the pandemic.\n\nChewy did report strong growth on the bottom line as its gross margin improved and it controlled costs.\n\nFreshpet, on the other hand, has bucked the broader trend in the pet industry, reporting 26% revenue growth to $253.4 million in the quarter, showing the continuing strength of the business. In fact, that marked its 25th consecutive quarter of at least 25% growth. At the same time, Freshpet has also delivered solid-margin expansion, and its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) nearly doubled to $43.5 million.\n\nValuation: Chewy vs. Freshpet\n\nValuation is also a key metric to assess for any stock.\n\nChewy currently trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28, though that includes substantial stock-based compensation.\n\nFreshpet, on the other hand, is more expensive as it's valued according to its track record of growth. The stock currently trades at a P/E ratio of 170.\n\nNeither company pays a dividend.\n\nWhat's the better buy?\n\nBoth companies have promising long-term prospects in the pet-products industry, but Freshpet gets the edge due to its much stronger growth rate.\n\nThe company has scaled up effectively with a new efficient manufacturing plant, and it continues to expand its product reach through new stores. Chewy, on the other hand, is struggling to find new avenues for growth in the current environment.\n\nFreshpet might be the more expensive of the two stocks, but it's the better buy thanks to its strong growth.",
      "# [No More Pulling! Here’s How to Leash Train Your Dog by Irith Bloom, CPDT-KSA, Irith Bloom, CPDT-KSA on 2017-04-25](https://be.chewy.com/leash-train-dog-2/)\nDoes your dog pull you down the street whenever you take them for a walk? Do they run circles around you (wrapping you in the leash in the process) or treat their leash like a tug toy? You’re not alone—walking on a leash doesn’t come naturally for many dogs. But here’s the good news: With the right training, most dogs can learn to walk politely beside you. You just have to know how to leash train a dog.\n\nSince there are so many situations where dogs must be leashed, understanding how to leash train a dog belongs at the top of your pet parent priority list. From hiking to dining at dog-friendly restaurants to basic walks around the neighborhood, proper leash training opens up a world of fun activities for you and your pup to explore together.\n\nReady to get started? As a professional dog trainer, I’m here to guide you through everything you need to know about training your dog to walk on leash.\n\nThe Benefits of Leash Training\n\nLeash training a dog has a variety of benefits:\n\nBeing able to take a walk without your dog pulling: While pulling on leash may not sound so bad, repeated walks with a dog who is pulling can cause stress to your muscles and joints. In extreme cases, a dog can pull you right off your feet. Walking with a dog who behaves well on leash is much more pleasant.\n\nOpportunities to go here, there and everywhere: Dogs can suffer from boredom just like people. Regular outings to new places help keep your dog’s mind happily occupied. (And it breaks up the monotony of daily walks for you, too.)\n\nExercise (for you and your dog): Like us, dogs get cardiovascular benefits from walking. Movement is good for your dog’s body! And since walking with a dog who has good leash manners is fun, you’ll probably get more walking in yourself. It’s a win-win!\n\nOutdoor time (for you and your dog): There are lots benefits to being outdoors. You get a break from staring at your computer while your pooch gets a break from staring at the walls, and you both get fresh air and a change of pace. Both you and your dog are likely to feel refreshed and happy after walking outside.\n\nAll of these benefits depend on training your dog to walk on leash properly. That means now’s the time to get started!\n\nSupplies for Leash Training a Dog\n\nBefore starting to leash train a puppy or adult dog, gather everything your dog needs for success:\n\nTraining treats to use as rewards\n\nA quality 6-foot leash that feels good in your hand (avoid using a retractable leash, which can be confusing for some dogs due to its constant pulling effect)\n\nDog poop bags and a poop bag holder\n\nA well-fitted dog harness\n\nWhy Do I Need a Dog Harness?\n\nIf you’re like most dog parents, a collar was probably one of the first purchases you made for your furry friend. So why should you use a dog harness rather than simply clipping their leash to their collar for walks?\n\nThe answer: Harnesses are gentler on your dog’s neck. The pressure of a leash being yanked on a collar can cause physical harm to your dog—and that’s true no matter whether you or your dog is doing the pulling. Using a harness distributes leash pressure more evenly across the dog’s body, so it’s less likely to cause injury.\n\nIf your dog is prone to pulling, I recommend a front-clip harness. That’s because when the leash is attached to the front of your dog’s chest, the force of their pulling will turn them to the side, which makes it more difficult for them to dig in and pull with their full force. Some harnesses, such as the Freedom Harness, come with both types of clips, so you can choose which clip to use.\n\nFrisco Padded Nylon No Pull Dog Harness\n\n$16.06\n\nFrisco Nylon Step In Back Clip Dog Harness\n\n$9.96\n\nBest Pet Supplies Voyager Dog Harness\n\n$11.99\n\nTemporarily out of stock\n\nHow to Leash Train a Dog: Step-by-Step Instructions\n\nTraining a dog to walk on a leash is all about teaching your dog where you want them to be. Yanking on the leash doesn’t help your dog learn what they’re supposed to do—and can cause injury to your pup. Positive reinforcement (aka rewarding your dog with treats for being at your side) works much better. The dog training steps below take you through the process of how to teach any dog, from a new puppy to adult or older dog, to walk on leash.\n\nPro tip: Before you get started, remember that walking on leash isn’t a skill most dogs learn overnight. Keep your training sessions around 10-15 minutes, or even shorter if you’re working with a puppy, since that’s about as long as the typical dog’s attention span will last. When you move to outdoor walks, you can work up to longer sessions—there’s a lot more out there to keep your dog entertained, after all!\n\n1 Start in a small, quiet space indoors.\n\nTeach this behavior indoors, in a small, quiet room. It’s much easier to start training dogs to walk on leash when they are in a confined area and aren’t surrounded by exciting distractions.\n\n2 Introduce the harness and leash—with treats!\n\nPut on the harness and clip the dog leash to it. Feed your dog a treat right afterward (it’s a good reminder that hanging out near you is worthwhile).\n\nPro tip: Having trouble getting your dog to wear their harness? Use a treat to lure your dog’s head through the neck hole, and continue feeding treats at each stage of the harnessing process: one when the harness goes on, another when you clip the harness, and a third when you attach the leash.\n\n3 Take a small step in any direction.\n\nIt’s time to teach your dog to stay by your side. Take a tiny step, then stop and watch your dog. As soon as your dog takes even a single step in your direction, praise and feed the dog a treat right at their head level, next to your leg. (Feeding that tasty treat at your leg helps your dog learn where you want them to be.)\n\n4 Practice moving in different directions.\n\nWhen your dog has mastered following you in one direction, it’s time to switch things up. Keep moving around the room in different directions, feeding treats every time your dog follows your lead. For example, if you began by stepping forward, try stepping backward or to the side—all the ways you might move while on a walk. Treat your dog every time they move along with you.\n\nPractice this for around 10-15 minutes per day until your pup consistently follows you.\n\n5 Start feeding treats only on one side.\n\nOnce your dog is consistently stepping along with you, pick a side to feed the treat on. It doesn’t matter whether it’s the left side or right—you just need to pick one, and consistently feed on that side only. This makes it easier for your pup to understand where you want them to be, and helps keep them from zigzagging in front of you.\n\nPro tip: If your dog ends up on the wrong side of you and isn’t following the treats to the correct side, step around them so that they’re on the correct side. Then, take a smaller step away from your dog and try again. If necessary, make your steps tiny for a while, so it’s easier for your dog to stay on the correct side.\n\n6Begin to vary how often you feed the treats.\n\nOnce your dog is walking nicely with you for a treat after each step, start to vary how often you feed the treats. You might do two steps, then a treat, then four steps, then a treat, then one step, then a treat, and so on. Keep the pattern random! That’ll help keep your dog focused.\n\n7Find new places to practice.\n\nWhen your dog has mastered leash walking in a small room, practice dog walking in other areas. A hallway is a great environment to try next, because the narrowness of a hallway helps keep your dog near you as you practice. Go back to feeding one treat per step when you start in a new area, though, since it will be a little harder for your dog. Then gradually reduce the frequency of treats as you did before.\n\nEventually, you can practice walking in a larger room, walking all around your home and even in your backyard. In each new place, begin with small steps and frequent treats, and gradually work up to larger steps and fewer treats.\n\n8Take a walk out in the world!\n\nWhen your dog consistently displays good behavior on at home, it’s time to test their skills in less familiar territory. Leash them up and take a walk around your neighborhood. Just like with the other new environments, use smaller steps and frequent treats until you can work up to a more challenging walk.\n\nPro tip: If your dog’s behavior starts to fall apart—if they start pulling, zigzagging or wandering away from your side—go back to an easier situation or feed treats more often (or both).\n\nLeash Training Troubleshooting\n\nTry these training tips to curb common behaviors while on leash:\n\nPulling\n\nIf your dog continues pulling, you may be feeding too few treats, the treats may not be tasty (aka high value) enough, or the situation may be beyond your dog’s level of training. Feed more often, use super-delicious treats, or take your dog to an easier location.\n\nLunging or Chasing Things\n\nIf your dog lunges or starts chasing something, stop walking and hold steady. Instead of yanking on the leash, call your dog’s name in a cheerful tone, making kissy noises, or stamping your feet. Once you have your dog’s attention, praise, hand them a treat, and then walk away, feeding treats with each step, until your dog calms down.\n\nIf you can’t get your dog’s attention, you’ll have to gently pull them away. This is the “least bad” solution. In a perfect world, your dog will come with you on a verbal cue (like “come”), but hey, life isn’t always perfect. If you do have to pull them away, do not jerk the leash. Instead, anchor your leash hand against your belly button and calmly walk away with the leash held firmly at your abdomen, creating steady but gentle pressure on your dog as you go. Direct your gaze, shoulders and hips in the direction you’re walking—to your dog, this implies that you’re walking toward something, which just might spark their curiosity and inspire them to join you!\n\nBiting or Playing With the Leash\n\nIf your dog keeps turning around to bite or play with the leash, remember this No. 1 rule: Never pull the leash away from the dog! It might seem counterintuitive, but pulling back on a leash your dog is playing with just makes the leash an awesome tug toy. A loose leash is far less fun for your pup.\n\nInstead, move the leash gently toward your dog so all tension is released and they can’t get that satisfying tug feeling. If necessary, use two leashes on walks, so that if your dog grabs one, you can let it fall to the ground while keeping your grip on the other leash.\n\nOnce your dog has dropped the leash, start walking, praising and rapid-fire treating. Most dogs decide pretty quickly that walking with you is way more fun than tugging on the leash.\n\nLeash Training FAQs\n\nQ:At what age should I start leash training a puppy?\n\nA:You can start puppy leash training as soon as they come home, which is typically around 8 weeks. Just remember to keep things low-key. Work indoors, in the smallest room possible, and for puppies around 8 weeks, work for no longer than a minute at a time before taking off the leash. As your puppy grows up, you can increase the duration of your sessions.\n\nQ:How do I train a dog to walk beside me?\n\nA:To train a dog to walk beside you, practice tiny steps on leash in a small, quiet space and treat them whenever they move along with you. Gradually work up to different areas of your home, larger steps and fewer treats, until they eventually learn to walk beside you while on leash.\n\nQ:How do I teach my dog not to pull on their leash?\n\nA:To teach your dog not to pull on their leash, start by practicing tiny steps in a small, quiet space and treat them whenever they move along with you (rather than pulling on the leash). It’s also a good idea to use a harness with a front clip to deter them from pulling.\n\nTraining dogs to walk on leash opens up a world of possibilities for them (and you). Dogs need practice to master this challenging skill, and by working through the steps above, you’re on your way to relaxing, enjoyable walks for you both. Stay patient, and remember: It’s worth the time and effort. After all, this is a skill that will pay dividends for life!\n\nBeSmart\n\nFeatured Products\n\n2 Hounds Design Freedom No Pull Nylon Dog Harness & Leash, Purple, Large: 28 to 32-in chest, 1-in wide\n\n$41.96\n\nZuke's Mini Naturals Peanut Butter & Oats Recipe Training Dog Treats, 1-lb bag\n\n$18.99\n\nTemporarily out of stock",

While the company reported solid third-quarter results with promising topline trends and benefitted from a successful Cyber Week, McTernan believes that the supportive macro environment is already reflected in the stock’s current price.\n\nChewy is making strategic investments in customer acquisition, which are expected to yield high returns given their effective lifetime value to customer acquisition cost metrics. These efforts are anticipated to drive modest revenue growth acceleration through 2025, supported by a shift to their proprietary ad tech stack. However, McTernan assumes that continued high spending on sales and marketing will slightly reduce adjusted EBITDA estimates for 2025, justifying a Hold rating at this time.\n\nAccording to TipRanks, McTernan is a 4-star analyst with an average return of 4.3% and a 50.93% success rate.

      "# [Has there ever been a better way of ending the day? Crispy, chewy Ovaltine cookies taste great by Monika Spykerman on 2024-09-25](https://www.columbian.com/news/2024/sep/25/has-there-ever-been-a-better-way-of-ending-the-day-crispy-chewy-ovaltine-cookies-taste-great/)\nOne thing I really enjoyed about our recent trip to England was the variety of fun things to drink, like Ribena blackcurrant syrup and sparkling elderflower flavored water. What really got my taste buds going were hot drink powders like Barleycup, Horlick’s and Ovaltine.\n\nI became particularly obsessed with Barleycup, made from barley, rye and chicory. I’ve been trying to cut back on coffee. (Full disclosure: I am drinking coffee as I write this, so that’s how it’s going.)\n\nI’ve been on the hunt for hot beverages that have a similar flavor profile to coffee but contain little or no caffeine. Here in my mid-50s, caffeine makes my hands shake so badly that I can barely drink my 12th cup of coffee.\n\nEngland was mostly cool and misty (shocking, I know) so I was already in an autumnal frame of mind when we returned home. Everyone knows that autumn means cookies. (FYI: Summer, winter and spring also mean cookies.)\n\nI was searching around for cookie recipes when I had a “Eureka!” moment. Why not mix some of that yummy drink powder right into the dough?\n\nAh, but I am not the first person to think of this. Many recipes for cookies use not only Ovaltine but also Barleycup, Horlicks and chicory powder, made from the roasted roots of the chicory flower and a popular coffee additive in New Orleans. (Think Café du Monde and beignets.)\n\nObviously these things are difficult to find in the Pacific Northwest, where we just add more coffee to our coffee. But one thing every grocery store has is Ovaltine, either the original malt flavor (with no cocoa), the chocolate malt (with malt and cocoa) or the rich chocolate flavor (which contains no malt).\n\nBefore I delved into the recipe, I wanted to learn more. Who were the first people to make a hot beverage out of powdered grain?\n\nIn 1869, British brothers James and William Horlick created a powder of malted barley, milk powder and wheat flour as a nutritional supplement for babies and convalescing adults. (Malt, in case you’re wondering, consists of toasted sprouted grains, giving them caramel-like flavor.)\n\nHorlick’s was regularly prescribed by doctors and dentists of the day and soldiers also received rations of Horlicks to bolster their health during military operations.\n\nOvaltine wasn’t developed until half a century later, when Swiss chemist Alber Wander created Ovomaltine from powdered malt, milk, eggs and cocoa. It was conceived as a healthful drink on the premise that barley malt contains many vitamins.\n\nIt was exported to England in 1909 under the name Ovaltine, then it came to the U.S., Canada, Australia and Southeast Asia. It’s still quite a popular drink in India.\n\nTo this day, there’s an Ovaltine factory near Bern, Switzerland (though it’s also made in several other countries).\n\nThe formula has changed in the last 100 years and different variations are sold in different countries. British Ovaltine, for example, no longer contains eggs.\n\nOvaltine and other beverage powders have been used by home cooks to enrich baked goods for a hundred years. Now I’m joining that noble procession with my own recipe for chocolate chip Ovaltine cookies.\n\nThe recipe uses 1/2 cup Ovaltine, so that malt flavor really comes through. You can also add nuts or crushed chocolate-covered malt balls instead of, or in addition to, chocolate chips. The texture is part of what makes these cookies so delicious because they bake up crispy around the edges but chewy in the middle. It’s the best of both cookie worlds.\n\nFirst, melt a stick of butter (1/2 cup) and set it aside to cool slightly. Sift 1 ½ cups flour, 1/2 cup Ovaltine — any variety, I used chocolate malt — and ½ teaspoon baking soda into a big bowl.\n\nWhisk in 1/2 cup packed brown sugar. Make a well in the middle, pour in the melted butter, one beaten egg and 2 tablespoons of milk.\n\nFold in ½ cup chocolate chips, nuts or crushed chocolate-covered malt balls or a combination of all three.\n\nLeave the dough to sit while heating the oven to 350 degrees. Pour ¹/3 cup of sugar into a bowl. (In honor of fall, I couldn’t help but add a teaspoon of pumpkin spice to the sugar. You may be able to show more restraint.)\n\nScoop tablespoon-sized chunks out of the dough, roll into balls and coat thoroughly with sugar. Flatten slightly and place on cookie sheet with room in between, because these cookies spread while baking. Bake for 15 minutes or until golden brown and crackled on top (or bake for 12 minutes for chewier cookies). Let the cookies cool completely on a wire rack.\n\nEat all 30 cookies. Over a period of many days, of course. What else could I mean? Excuse me while I wipe these crumbs off my mouth.\n\nOvaltine Cookies\n\n1½ cups flour\n\n1/2 cup any variety Ovaltine (or other malted drink powder)\n\n1/2 cup packed brown sugar\n\n½ teaspoon baking soda\n\n½ cup butter, melted\n\n1 large egg, beaten\n\n1 teaspoon vanilla\n\n2 tablespoons milk\n\n½ cup chocolate chips, pecans or walnuts (or ¼ cup chips and ¼ cup nuts)\n\n1/3 cup sugar for rolling\n\nMelt the butter and set it aside. Sift the flour, Ovaltine and baking soda into a big bowl. Whisk in brown sugar. Make a well in the middle; pour in the melted butter and beaten egg. Stir to combine and then leave the dough to sit while heating the oven to 350 degrees. Pour ½ cup of sugar into a bowl. Scoop tablespoon-sized chunks out of the dough, roll into balls and coat thoroughly with sugar. Flatten slightly and place on cookie sheet spaced well apart because the cookies spread while baking. Bake for 15 minutes or until golden brown and crackled on top. (Bake for 12 minutes for chewier cookies.) Let the cookies cool completely on a wire rack. Makes about 30."
