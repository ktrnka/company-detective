Your bird? nasal passages are then dried, which, in most cases, causes sneezing.\n\nSYMPTOMS\n\nA bird may sneeze for a number of reasons other than it being in an environment that is too dry. Vitamin-A deficiency or a bacterial, fungal or viral infection can also cause sneezing and discharge from your bird? nares. A more serious problem that could cause damage to the nasal or sinus passages could be the case if audible breathing sounds, tail-bobbing, weight loss, nasal or eye discharge or a change in vocalizations or eating habits accompany the sneezing.\n\nIf a bird that is native to Central or South America is housed with or near a dusty bird, such as a cockatoo, cockatiel, African grey or Eclectus, the dander from these birds can cause sneezing in your other birds.\n\nIMMEDIATE CARE\n\nSome sneezing is normal and is likely due to a dry environment. If it becomes a chronic problem or nasal discharge accompanies the sneezing, a full vet check is necessary to determine is the problem is due to some sort of infection.\n\nLONG-TERM CARE\n\nKeep your bird in an adequately humid environment so the cilia in their nasal passages can work properly to clear debris. Provide your bird with a sufficient amount of Vitamin-A, which also helps the nasal passages work properly.\n\nIf the vet tests determine that no disease or infection is the cause for the sneezing, here are several tips for improving your bird? too-dry environment:\n\n1) Take your bird into the bathroom while you shower, enveloping it in high humidity.\n\n2) Have your avian vet show you how to periodically flush your bird? nostrils with sterile saline to remove debris or set up a regular appointment to have your vet perform the saline flushing.\n\n3) Try moving the bird into a room with a humidifier, but always keep the water clean to prevent bacteria from growing\n\n4) Place bird safe plants in your bird? room, which will add oxygen and humidity to its environment.\n\n5) Periodically mist your bird to raise humidity\n\n6) Reduce allergens by running am air filter with HEPA filtration. Run a box fan with an air conditioner filter on the back to catch dust, dander and feathers. This will increase the efficiency of the air filter, which will clean any additional allergens not caught by the fan.\n\nPosted By: Chewy Editorial\n\nFeatured Image: By Ladymoonz/Shutterstock",

      "# [7 Cat Laxatives To Relieve Cat Constipation (and How to Choose the Right One) by Katie Koschalk on 2024-01-11](https://be.chewy.com/cat-laxatives/)\nNormally, a cat’s digestive system purrs right along, smoothly and without a hitch. But sometimes things can get a bit clogged, leading to constipation.\n\nSo, how do you get things moving again? A common approach is the use of cat laxatives, which help stimulate a bowel movement.\n\nThere are seven commonly used cat laxatives, but choosing the right one—with the guidance of your veterinarian—depends on a variety of factors, including the cause of constipation; your cat’s overall health and age; and any underlying medical conditions they have.\n\nWe spoke to vet experts to get the inside scoop on constipation and cat laxatives, including how they can help your furry pal and how to choose the right one.\n\nWhat Is Cat Constipation?\n\nCat constipation is a common health issue where a cat experiences difficulty passing feces or poops less frequently than normal, says Dr. Winnie Ybarra, DVM, DACVIM, a veterinary internist at San Francisco Animal Medical Center in San Francisco.\n\nCats typically poop once per day, although some poop twice daily. Pooping less than this could be a sign of constipation.\n\nAccording to Dr. Nicole Savageau, VMD, a veterinarian with The Vets in Austin, Texas, common causes of constipation in cats include:\n\nDehydration\n\nLack of exercise\n\nStress and anxiety\n\nHairballs\n\nDietary issues and food changes\n\nInflammatory bowel disease\n\nMore serious causes can include pelvic injuries; a blockage due to a foreign body; kidney disease; megacolon (a condition where the colon becomes enlarged); neurological issues; and some types of cancer. In some cases, no underlying cause of constipation can be determined.\n\nSymptoms of Cat Constipation\n\nUnlike humans, cats can’t verbally communicate their discomfort, so it’s important for cat parents to be observant of their feline’s behavior and bodily functions. Recognizing the symptoms of constipation in cats is crucial for timely and effective treatment.\n\nBelow, Dr. Ybarra shares some common symptoms of constipation to watch for.\n\nInfrequent or no bowel movements\n\nHard, round, dry feces (as opposed to well-formed, slightly soft feces)\n\nStraining in the litter box; spending a long time in the litter box; or avoiding the litter box altogether\n\nDisplaying signs of pain or discomfort (like crying out) while trying to defecate\n\nBloody or mucus-covered stools\n\nBlood or mucus around the rectum\n\nLethargy or reduced activity\n\nPoor appetite\n\nVomiting\n\nAbdominal bloating\n\nHow to Help a Constipated Cat: Cat Laxatives\n\nWhen your cat is suffering from constipation, there are several steps you can take to help alleviate their discomfort and address the underlying issue. We’ll touch on the full gamut shortly, but first, let’s zero in on laxatives.\n\nCat laxatives are substances designed to help cats with constipation by facilitating bowel movements. They work in various ways, such as stimulating intestinal muscles or drawing water into the colon.\n\n4 Types of Cat Laxatives\n\nThe choice of laxative depends on the severity of the constipation and the cat’s overall health. There are four main types of laxatives:\n\nLubricant laxatives: Coats the stool and intestines in a lubricating film, easing the passage of feces.\n\nOsmotic laxatives: Draws water into the colon from surrounding tissues. This increased water content helps soften the stool and increases its volume, which, in turn, stimulates bowel movements.\n\nStimulant laxatives: Triggers the intestines to contract and push out the stool.\n\nBulk-forming laxatives: Provides fiber, which increases the bulk of the stool. This can stimulate a cat’s bowels.\n\n7 Common Cat Laxatives\n\nAccording to Dr. Ybarra and Dr. Savageau, common cat laxatives include:\n\nCat Lax (lubricant)\n\nMineral oil (lubricant)\n\nPolyethylene glycol 3350, aka Miralax (osmotic)\n\nLactulose (osmotic)\n\nCisapride (stimulant)\n\nMetoclopramide (stimulant)\n\nPsyllium husk, aka Metamucil (bulk-forming)\n\nWhile not technically a laxative, canned, unsweetened pumpkin can also sometimes help relieve constipation. Pumpkins have a high water and fiber content, and can hydrate the intestines and their contents. A couple of pet parent pumpkin favorites are Weruva Pureed Pumpkin and Nummy Tum-Tum Pumpkin. Note that these pumpkin foods should not replace your cat’s regular food but rather act as a supplement to relieve occasional constipation.\n\nWeruva Pumpkin Patch Up! Dog & Cat Pouches, case of 12\n\n$11.99\n\nCat Lax Cat Supplement\n\n$10.23\n\nWhich Cat Laxative Should You Use?\n\nThe right laxative for your cat depends on a variety of factors, including the cause of constipation; your cat’s overall health and age; and any underlying medical conditions, says Dr. Ybarra.\n\nIt’s crucial to only give your cat a laxative based on a veterinarian’s recommendation and with their guidance. This not only ensures the treatment’s efficacy but also your feline friend’s safety and well-being. The improper or unsupervised use of laxatives can lead to complications such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalances or worsened constipation.\n\nIn addition to selecting a suitable laxative, your vet may also discuss other aspects of care that can help manage or prevent constipation.\n\nCat Laxative vs. Stool Softener\n\nWhen addressing constipation in cats, it’s important to understand the difference between a cat laxative and a stool softener for cats, as they serve different purposes in managing the condition.\n\nCat Laxatives\n\nLaxatives are generally used when there’s a need to actively induce a bowel movement.\n\nThey produce bowel movements in one of three ways:\n\nStimulating the muscles of the intestines\n\nDrawing water into the bowel from surrounding tissues\n\nIncreasing the weight or “bulk” of the stool\n\nStool Softeners\n\nStool softeners, on the other hand, work by increasing the amount of water absorbed by the stool in the intestines, Dr. Savageau says. This process results in softer stool, which is easier for the cat to pass.\n\nStool softeners are particularly beneficial for cats who need to avoid straining during defecation, such as those with certain medical conditions or post-surgical cases.\n\nIn some cases, both laxatives and stool softeners are used.\n\nWhen to Go to the Vet\n\nIf not properly treated, constipation in cats can lead to several health risks, some of which can be life-threatening, such as:\n\nMegacolon: A condition where the colon becomes abnormally enlarged and loses its ability to function properly. This can be caused by the colon being consistently stretched more than it should be, such as when a cat has chronic constipation.\n\nObstipation: A severe form of constipation where a cat cannot pass any stool or gas, usually due to fecal matter becoming dry and hard in the intestines.\n\nToxemia: A condition that can occur when prolonged constipation leads to the accumulation and stagnation of feces in the colon. This stagnation can result in the absorption of toxins into the bloodstream.\n\nDue to these risks, it’s essential to treat constipation promptly. If constipation persists for more than 24–48 hours, bring your cat to a veterinarian. The doctor can assess your cat’s health; work to determine the underlying cause; and provide a treatment plan.\n\nCat Constipation Treatment\n\nDr. Savageau shares some common cat constipation remedies, including:\n\nIncrease water intake: Dehydration is a common cause of constipation. Ensure your cat has access to fresh, clean water at all times. Consider using a cat water fountain, such as the Drinkwell Pet Fountain or Catit Flower Fountain, as cats often prefer running water. Learn more tips to get your kitty to drink more water.\n\nDietary changes: Your vet might recommend incorporating more fiber and water into your cat’s diet through wet food, specially formulated cat food or nutritional supplements, such as psyllium husk or canned pumpkin. A higher fiber diet should be introduced gradually to avoid upsetting your cat’s stomach.\n\nLaxatives or stool softeners: Your vet might give your cat specific laxatives or stool softeners to get things moving or soften the stool.\n\nExercise: Encourage your cat to engage in regular physical activity. Play sessions can help stimulate digestion and bowel movements.\n\nReducing stress: In some cases, stress and anxiety can cause constipation. Stress can be caused by big things like adding a new pet to the house, or smaller things like construction noise outside. Soothing your cat, and reducing or removing environmental stress, if possible, could help ease constipation. Explore popular cat calming aids.\n\nUltimately, the treatment for constipation depends on its severity, adds Dr. Ybarra. “If the constipation is mild, adding water, canned food or fiber to the diet can help,” she says. If it’s more severe, enemas (performed by a vet) and medication might be needed. “Very severe cases require manual deobstipation under anesthesia,” she says.\n\nBy recognizing the symptoms of constipation, knowing when to seek veterinary assistance and understanding the treatment options available, you can ensure your cat remains comfortable and healthy.\n\nLooking for more information surrounding kitty bathroom conundrums?

      "# [28 Most Beautiful Cat Breeds in the World by Annie Butler Shirreffs on 2024-04-03](https://be.chewy.com/beautiful-cats/)\nWhat makes a cat beautiful? For some people, the cat breed’s coat color or pattern put them on the most beautiful cats list. For others, it’s the color of the eyes.\n\nFor Rick Hoskinson, an all-breed judge with The International Cat Association (TICA), a registry of purebred cats, it’s a combination of these qualities that makes a cat truly striking. “A beautifully balanced cat with stunning condition is always an attention getter,” he says. “A cat with a striking coat pattern and eye color is also beautiful.”\n\nA beautiful cat is like a beautiful work of art, says Teresa Keiger, an all-breed judge with the pedigreed cat registry Cat Fanciers’ Association (CFA). She explains that a “balanced” cat means that all body parts are in harmony with each other—where no one aspect dominates and all body parts fit together as a whole. “With some breeds, all the parts might be very different. But put them all together, and you have one lovely piece.”\n\n16 Beautiful Cats\n\nWith the help of current CFA and TICA registration lists, input from all-breed judges Keiger and Hoskinson and a couple of informal polls, we came up with the following list of beautiful cats, who (bonus!) also happen to be friendly and people-oriented.\n\nBut before we start, a word of warning: The topic of most beautiful domestic cat breeds is very subjective. Every cat enthusiast, every cat parent and every cat breed judge has their own idea of the most beautiful cats in the world. So, we hope you enjoy—and agree with—our picks.\n\nAbyssinian\n\nWe start our list with one of the oldest known cat breeds. The Abyssinian’s defining feature is a richly colored, ticked tabby coat in which each hair is ticked with four to six bands of color—dark at the tip, lighter at the roots and alternating dark and light. The original coat color is known as ruddy, but the Abyssinian also comes in different shades, including red, blue and fawn. The face features dramatic markings that don’t appear anywhere else on the body.\n\nAbyssinians are extremely graceful and elegant. They remind Keiger of male ballet dancers—“muscular, lithe and seeming to be barely standing on the Earth.”\n\nAmerican Shorthair\n\nA replication of the short-haired cats who came with settlers from Europe to North America, American Shorthairs are known as America’s shorthaired breed. “Often referred to as a ‘working cat’—which the breed originally was—the muscular body shows this,” says Keiger, who serves as editor of CFA’s Cat Talk magazine.\n\nThe short coats have a hard, dense and lustrous texture, giving the breed a natural protective appearance. They come in a variety of colors (like white, black, blue aka gray, and brown) and patterns (like calico, tortoiseshell and bi-color), but the most popular—and recognizable—color and pattern is a silver base with black tabby markings. These tabby markings create swirls all over the body, broken “necklaces” that highlight the chest, rings around the legs and an “M” mark on the forehead.\n\nBengal\n\nSeeing spots? You’re probably looking at a Bengal cat. Originally developed from crosses between domestic cats and the Asian leopard cat, Bengals are most noted for their richly colored, highly contrasted coat of vivid spots and distinctive marbling. “What I find so striking about the Bengal is the color and pattern,” Keiger says. Some have rosettes like those found on leopards, jaguars and ocelots. In fact, the Bengal is the only domestic cat with rosettes. Some Bengal coats even feature “glitter,” which gives each hair an iridescent sheen. Not only beautiful to behold, the Bengal coat is also soft and luxurious to the touch, having “a pelt-like feel that no other breed has,” Keiger says.\n\nCombine the Bengal’s distinctive coat with their wild expression, created by tabby facial markings and large oval eyes, and it’s easy to see why this breed has captivated many cat lovers.\n\nBirman\n\nKnown for a soft, silky, lush coat and soulful, deep-blue eyes, the Birman is classified as a pointed breed, which means the cat will have different, darker colors on the face, ears, feet and tail. Keiger says the Birman comes dressed for a party, as the breed also has a white spotting pattern with white “gloves” on all paws and “laces” up the back legs. She also points out their expressive eyes.\n\nKnown as “The Sacred Cat of Burma,” the Birman comes in a rainbow of colors, and the beautiful coat features a longer ruff round the neck and a fluffy tail. The pattern within their points can be solid, tabby or tortoiseshell.\n\nLike all color-point breeds, the Birman is born white, with the color developing as they mature.\n\nBritish Shorthair\n\nAnother of the oldest known breeds, everything about the British Shorthair is round—ears, tail, paws and expressive eyes in a round head with round cheeks.\n\nBest known for their gray (also known as blue) coat, the British Shorthair comes in a variety of colors. And that coat! Keiger says the British Shorthair has the densest coat of any of the CFA breeds—“one that you just want to squeeze and run your fingers through all day.”\n\nAnd here’s a fun fact: It’s believed that the British Shorthair was the inspiration for the Cheshire Cat in Lewis Carroll’s “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.”\n\nBurmese\n\nCompact and muscular, the Burmese is surprisingly heavy for their size, and that little body is covered with a silky, close-lying coat.\n\nThe Burmese’s original color is sable (a warm, rich brown), but they also come in a variety of colors, including champagne (a warm beige), blue (a medium gray) and a soft chocolate.\n\nAnd nestled in these beautiful colors is a pair of round, gold eyes that Keiger says are very expressive.\n\nDevon Rex\n\nIs it an alien? Is it an elf? Nope—it’s a Devon Rex! Known as the pixies of the cat world, the Devon Rex’s appearance is far from ordinary—a long, skinny neck, elfin face, oversized ears and large, impish eyes.\n\nPerhaps the most distinctive feature of the Devon Rex is their coat, which is velvety soft and ripples with curls. Those curls are a result of a natural mutation and appear everywhere on the body. “Even its whiskers are curled,” Keiger says.\n\nThe coat ranges from a mop of curls to a suede-like coat and comes in all colors and patterns.\n\nEuropean Burmese\n\nThe European Burmese is a cousin to the “American” Burmese above. While the Burmese has a compact, well-rounded appearance, the European Burmese is somewhat longer with gently rounded contours. The European Burmese is also slightly larger, and has a more pronounced, longer muzzle.\n\nThe biggest and most obvious difference between the two is the array of colors seen in the European Burmese—all 10 of them.\n\nThe eye shape differs between the breeds as well. Keiger says the European Burmese has sultry eyes that suck you right in. “They’re slightly hooded on the top, fully round on the bottom, and incredibly lustrous and deep in color.”\n\nPersian\n\nEasily one of the most recognizable breeds, the Persian is the quintessential “fluffy cat.” Because of that fluffy coat, these long-haired cats appear larger than they actually are. The luxurious coat is quite long and comes in a variety of colors and patterns.\n\n“The breed standard calls for a ‘sweet expression,’ so being beautiful is part of its overall being,” Keiger says. That sweet expression rests on a flat face with large, round, expressive eyes.\n\nExotic\n\nThe short-haired cousin of the Persian cat, the Exotic (also called the Exotic Shorthair) has the same round head, sweet open expression, flat profile and large, expressive eyes.\n\nThey’re bred to meet the Persian standard in every way but one. Instead of long hair, the Exotic has a thick, short coat. “You’ll revel in stroking the plush, dense coat,” Keiger says.\n\nThat short coat is unique to the Exotic, giving them a soft, rounded, teddy bear look, and it requires much less grooming than a Persian, hence the affectionate nickname “the lazy man’s Persian.”\n\nLike the Persian, the Exotic comes in a variety of colors and patterns.\n\nMaine Coon Cat\n\nKnown as “gentle giants,” Maine Coons are one of the most popular breeds in the United States. In fact, for the first time in, well, ever, the Maine Coon Cat surpassed the Bengal to become the No. 1 cat on TICA’s most recent Top 10 Breeds list.\n\nThe Maine Coon Cat is a great example of “survival of the fittest” evolution. Long-haired cats came with the settlers to the United States, and these cats naturally developed into sturdy, working cats suited to the Northeast’s harsh winters, which explains the long coat (of three distinct lengths!), a long tail they can wrap around their bodies, and their well-tufted ears and feet. Keiger says that the gorgeous, long coat comes in a wide variety of striking colors and patterns.\n\nSiamese\n\nEverything about the Siamese cat is long and sleek—long body, long head, long legs and long tail. These long, chiseled lines coupled with the angular, wedge-shaped head makes the Siamese look rather sophisticated.\n\nIn contrast to the long body, the Siamese coat is short and silky. “A good Siamese doesn’t even appear to have a coat, as it lies so close to the body,” Keiger says.\n\nThe Siamese sports a pointed coat, with seal (a dark brown) being one of the most well-known colors. But the points appear in three other colors, too: chocolate, blue and lilac. This pointed pattern accentuates the breed’s almond-shaped, blue eyes.\n\nOriental\n\nA member of the Siamese group, the Oriental has the same body type as their Siamese parent: elegant, long, lithe and slender. What makes the Oriental distinct is their wide array of colors and patterns combined with a short, sleek coat. Keiger calls the Oriental a Siamese with a different pattern—300 plus of them, in fact.\n\nThe Oriental comes in both longhair and shorthair varieties, adding the opportunity for even more breathtaking colors and patterns.\n\nRagdoll\n\nHitting No. 1 on CFA’s most recent Top 10 list, the Ragdoll is one of the largest breeds in the cat fancy. These big, laid back cats live up to their name by the way they happily get carried around by their people. They have a luxurious semi-long coat that’s silky, soft and plush, which Keiger says makes you want to just pick up the cat and cuddle them. But perhaps the first thing you might notice are their deep blue eyes that just pull you right in.\n\nThe Ragdoll cat comes in several coat colors (like chocolate, red and blue) and patterns (like colorpoint, bi-color and mitted).\n\nRussian Blue\n\nThe hallmark of this gorgeous breed is their bright, blue coat. The hairs are tipped with silver, giving the Russian Blue a glistening and shimmering look as the cat moves. The color itself is beautiful to look at, but the short, silky, dense coat is plush to the touch. You can even draw patterns in the coat with your fingers that will remain until you smooth them out again. Rounding out the Russian Blue’s beauty is their deep, emerald green eyes that, contrasted against the gray coat, are quite striking.\n\nKeiger, who has worked with the breed for more than 25 years, says the Russian Blue has a regal appearance as well. “I’ve had spectators comment that the Russian Blue ‘looks like a statue!’”\n\nScottish Fold\n\nThe first time Keiger saw a Scottish Fold, she thought the cat looked like an owl. “Its ears were folded so tightly against its round head that they were barely discernible,” she says. Those unique ears come from a natural genetic mutation, but not to worry! Their ears work just as well as any other cats’.\n\nScottish Fold kittens are born with straight ears, and at about 3 to 4 weeks of age, their ears fold—or not. Not all Scottish Folds have folded ears, but Keiger points out that those with upright ears have the same large, padded body, large, round head and expressive round eyes.\n\nThe Scottish Fold can be both short-haired and long-haired with a dense, plush coat that comes in all colors and patterns.\n\n12 Beautiful Rare Cat Breeds\n\nSome breeds (like the ones above) are a bit more mainstream and higher in popularity. But these rare breeds are sure to wow you as well.\n\nAmerican Curl\n\nUnique ears that curl back in a graceful arc give the American Curl an alert and happily surprised expression. Designed by Mother Nature herself, the ears arc gently backward and point toward the back of the skull. But the American Curl is actually born with straight ears. In three to five days, the ears start to curl back, staying in a tight rosebud position, then gradually unfurling until they permanently “set” at around 4 months of age.\n\nAlong with the striking, curved-back ears, Keiger says the American Curl is also a very graceful-appearing cat, with an elegant body, silky, flat-lying coat and expressive, walnut-shaped eyes.\n\nBombay\n\nWant a little panther in your life? Look no further than the Bombay. An example of a hybrid breed, which combines established characteristics of domestic breeds to create a specific, third look, the Bombay is a combination of black American Shorthairs and Burmese. Keiger says the Bombay resembles the Burmese, but they are larger with a somewhat longer head and slightly larger body.\n\nNicknamed “the patent-leather kid with the new-penny eyes,” the Bombay comes in one color: black. But it’s a deep, dense black with a high-gloss sheen. The coat is short and tight. Their beautiful eyes are anywhere from deep, rich gold to copper—just like a new copper penny.\n\nAdding to the breed’s beauty, Bombays sport a sweet facial expression and have a cute little sway when they walk, similar to that of an Indian black leopard.\n\nChartreux\n\nKeiger thinks of the Chartreux as a study in asymmetrical balance. “None of the body parts should go together, but they do and go together beautifully,” she says. The Chartreux is both robust and elegant, with a muscular body set upon finely boned legs and dainty feet, which makes them often described as a “potato on toothpicks.”\n\nThis natural, historic breed of France has been known for centuries for both their unique coat texture and blue color. The coat is medium-short in length and slightly wooly in texture, and the blue color can range from light ash to deep slate.\n\nThe Chartreux’s large, expressive eyes are one of their most endearing features. “The copper to orange-colored eyes just pop against the blue fur,” Keiger says.\n\nCornish Rex\n\nKeiger calls the Cornish Rex a study in curves, arches and more curves. While these cats appear fine-boned and dainty, they are actually hard-bodied and muscular, slender with a deep curve to the chest rising up to a tucked-up waist, which is why they’re often referred to as the Greyhound of the cat world.\n\nTheir head is egg-shaped and topped with tall ears, while their expressive oval eyes have a slight upward slant.\n\nBut the most unique feature of the Cornish Rex is their coat, which is noticeably curly, falling into marcel waves. Even the eyebrows and whiskers are curled. The coat, which comes in all colors and patterns, is short, close to the body and incredibly soft to the touch.\n\nEgyptian Mau\n\nThe Egyptian Mau has the distinction of being the only naturally spotted domestic cat breed (the spots are not bred in) And those spots appear everywhere across their elegant body, Keiger says. The spots can be random and of any size.\n\nA natural breed, the Egyptian Mau comes in colors that occurred naturally: silver, bronze, smoke and black (as well as dilute versions of these colors). Their body is muscular and graceful. When standing, the Egyptian Mau has a “tiptoe stance,” as their hind legs are longer than their front legs. And their mesmerizing, gooseberry-green eyes are large and alert. The way they are set gives the cat a cute, “worried” look.\n\nHavana Brown\n\nThe elegant Havana Brown comes in one color: a rich, mahogany red-brown—with matching whiskers! “The short and smooth coat shows off the Havana’s graceful lines,” Keiger says.\n\nThe Havana also has a distinctive head shape that sets this breed apart. The head is slightly longer than it is wide, narrowing to a one-of-a-kind muzzle that’s often compared to a corn cob stuck on the end of the face. Keiger says the entire head structure may remind one of the shape of a light bulb, as the muzzle is so distinctly separate.\n\nThat unique face also includes brilliant green eyes—the greener, the better!\n\nJapanese Bobtail\n\nKnown as the good luck cat of Japan, the Japanese Bobtail is an ancient breed that has been portrayed in Japanese manuscripts and paintings for at least 1,000 years. If you’ve ever seen a ceramic cat with a raised, beckoning paw in shop windows or doorways, this is the cat!\n\nThe Japanese Bobtail has elegant high cheekbones and large oval-shaped eyes, but their most unique feature is their bobbed tail that consists of a variety of angles, curves and kinks that create a pom-pom effect. Not only is the tail unique to the breed but to each individual cat. No two tails are ever the same. The hair on the tail is longer than the hair on the body, contributing to the pom-pom look.\n\nKorat\n\nAnother good luck cat, this one hailing from Thailand, the Korat is a compact, powerful cat with a single, close-lying coat that allows their rippling muscles to show. Their unique color—defined as silver-tipped blue—gives the cat a shimmering quality. The color also absorbs light, creating a halo effect. Keiger says it resembles the color of rain clouds. “With luminous, green eyes, the silver-tipped blue coat really does seem to glow all over.”\n\nWe should also mention that the Korat’s head resembles a heart shape. As Keiger says, “One can’t help but love a cat with a heart-shaped head!”\n\nNorwegian Forest Cat\n\nA relatively new and rare breed in the U.S., the Norwegian Forest Cat is a very old breed in their native Norway and has been featured in folk tales and mythology for centuries.\n\nKnown in Norway as the skogkatt (which literally means forest cat), the Norwegian Forest Cat sports a lavish coat that served as natural protection back when they lived in the forest. The lavish coat makes this already large breed look even larger. The insulated, waterproof double coat was designed to withstand Scandinavian winters and features a full frontal ruff (hair around the neck), bushy tail, rear britches and tufted paws. “They really do look as though they walked out of a fairy-tale forest,” Keiger says,\n\nOften known for their brown tabby-and-white coats, Norwegian Forest cats actually come in nearly every possible coat pattern and color combination, except pointed, chocolate and lilac.\n\nSiberian\n\nStill fairly rare in the U.S., Siberian cats are a Russian national treasure that have been documented for hundreds of years and mentioned in Russian fairy tales and children’s books.\n\nA natural breed, the Siberian’s thick, rich triple coat protected the cats from the elements in their native country. The Siberian is considered a semi-longhair, but their coats vary with the seasons—a thick full coat in the winter and shedding down to a shorter, less dense coat in the summer.\n\nThe beautiful coat comes complete with a neck ruff, fluffy britches, a bushy tail, and hairs in and on top of the ears. “Plus, they possess some of the most unusual colors and patterns of all cats,” Keiger says.\n\nSomali\n\nThe Somali is essentially a long-haired Abyssinian, the result of a recessive gene in the Abyssinian breed. Their long hair is soft and finely textured, and comes in the same colors as the Abyssinian. Their vibrantly colored coat, striking facial markings, large ears and bushy tail give the cat a captivating, little fox look. And as Keiger says, who wouldn’t want to live with a cat that resembles a fox?\n\nTurkish Angora\n\nThe rare and beautiful Turkish Angora is considered a national treasure in their native Turkey with good reason—this breed is the epitome of elegance. Lithe and finely boned, the Turkish Angora is graceful and energetic. “The triangular head with flat planes and highly set ears just complete the image of a living work of art,” Keiger says.\n\nThat elegant body is covered with a semi-long, soft silky coat that rarely mats. The head is crowned with large, erect and tufted ears, and the tail streams behind them in a long plume. Although a white coat with blue eyes is favored in Turkey and was the original color of the breed when introduced into the U.S., the breed comes in a variety of colors and patterns.\n\nBottom line? Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. These are just some of the beautiful cats out there, each with their own distinctive looks, personalities and behaviors.

      "# [Spaying Cats: Everything You Need To Know by Wendy Rose Gould on 2024-06-26](https://be.chewy.com/spaying-cats/)\nYou’ve likely heard about the importance of spaying cats. While veterinarians and experts strongly recommend this procedure, it’s only natural to have questions about the process before jumping into it.\n\nAhead, we’re covering everything you need to know about getting a cat spayed, including when you should do it, what the procedure is like, the cost, the recovery time, and spaying’s benefits.\n\nWhat Is Cat Spaying?\n\nSpay for a cat is the process of removing the female reproductive organs, explains Jessica Thompson, DVM, a veterinarian based in Portland, Oregon. Medically referred to as an ovariohysterectomy, the cat spay procedure involves surgically removing the ovaries and uterus to prevent pregnancy. Spayed female cats also no longer have heat cycles.\n\nSpaying is performed under general anesthesia so your cat isn’t awake or aware of what’s going on. It’s considered a safe, routine procedure.\n\nWhen To Spay a Cat\n\nYou can technically spay a female cat at any point in her life. However, it’s generally recommended to spay a cat before her first heat cycle, which can occur as early as 4 months of age.\n\nAbel Gonzalez, DVM, a San Luis Obispo, California-based veterinarian, says this timing significantly reduces a female cat’s risk of mammary cancer, which increases significantly after a cat's first heat cycle and each time they go into heat.\n\nBenefits of Spaying a Cat\n\nAlong with preventing pregnancy, there are other notable benefits associated with the spay procedure. Spaying a female cat:\n\nReduces her risk of developing mammary cancer\n\nPrevents a type of uterine infection called pyometra\n\nEliminates undesirable behaviors (such as yowling and escaping) during the heat cycle\n\nPrevents overpopulation\n\nIncreases their lifespan, since they are less prone to certain health issues and are at a lower risk of injury from fights and accidents\n\nHow Much Does Spaying a Cat Cost?\n\nThe cost for spaying cats typically ranges from $5o to several hundred dollars. “Factors affecting the price include geographic location, type of clinic, and the cat’s health,” Dr. Gonzalez says. He adds, “Spaying during heat can be more expensive and some veterinarians prefer to wait until the heat cycle is over.”\n\nAdditionally, if your vet offers pre-anesthetic blood work, an intravenous (IV) catheter, or fluids during the procedure, these can contribute to higher costs. You can also expect to pay for pain medication as part of the spay aftercare.\n\nSome pet insurance policies may cover the cost for cat spaying and/or some of the associated costs incurred. Dr. Gonzales recommends double checking with your provider to determine what’s covered and what’s not so you can plan ahead.\n\nYou can also seek low-cost spaying procedures by checking with local animal shelters, humane societies, and the ASPCA. Your veterinarian may offer a payment plan to help you manage costs, too.\n\nWhat Is the Cat Spay Procedure Like?\n\nOn the day your cat’s being spayed, you’ll drop her off at the vet (often in the early morning, so don’t forget your coffee).\n\nOnce it’s time for surgery, the veterinarian will administer anesthesia to bring her into a deep slumber and ensure she experiences no pain during the procedure.\n\nWhile your cat is fast asleep, the vet will make a small incision into her abdomen to carefully remove her ovaries and uterus. This usually takes around 20 to 30 minutes, but it can vary depending on the cat’s age, weight, and overall health. Afterward, the incision is tightly closed with either sutures or surgical glue.\n\nAfter your cat’s spay procedure, she’ll be monitored carefully as she wakes up from anesthesia. You should receive a call, usually in the afternoon, letting you know that you can come pick up your kitty.\n\nThe vet will provide you with aftercare instructions and likely some medications to manage pain.\n\nWhat Is the Cat Spay Procedure Like?\n\nOn the day your cat’s being spayed, you’ll drop her off at the vet (often in the early morning, so don’t forget your coffee).\n\nOnce it’s time for surgery, the veterinarian will administer anesthesia to bring her into a deep slumber and ensure she experiences no pain during the procedure.\n\nWhile your cat is fast asleep, the vet will make a small incision into her abdomen to carefully remove her ovaries and uterus.

You should receive a call, usually in the afternoon, letting you know that you can come pick up your kitty.\n\nThe vet will provide you with aftercare instructions and likely some medications to manage pain.\n\nCat Spay Aftercare and Recovery\n\nAfter the spaying procedure, cats require a period of rest and recovery that lasts between 10 to 14 days.\n\n“During the first few days, the cat will be prescribed pain medication to manage their pain and discomfort,” Dr. Thompson says. Give her medications as instructed, and make sure you provide a comfortable, quiet, and safe place for your cat to get some rest.\n\nOffer your cat small amounts of water and a small meal once she is fully awake. You can gradually return to her regular diet over the next 24 hours, following your veterinarian's instructions.\n\nMonitor your cat’s spay incision healing process and ask your vet what warning signs to look out for. A healthy, healing incision should be free of excess redness, swelling, discharge, or gaps.\n\nKeep your calendar clear, because you may need to schedule a follow-up appointment with your vet to remove stitches and check on your cat’s recovery. Some stitches are absorbable and will dissolve on their own, while others need to be removed by the veterinarian. Your vet will let you know if a follow-up appointment is necessary.\n\nWhat You Need for Your Spayed Cat\n\nMake sure you have everything you need before getting a cat spayed.\n\nElizabethan collar: “It's important to prevent the cat from licking or chewing at the incision site. An Elizabethan collar is often recommended to prevent such behavior,” says Dr. Thompson. A soft option like the SunGrow Post-Surgery Soft Cone Dog & Cat Recovery Collar may be more comfortable than rigid options.\n\nSpay suit: Alternatively, Dr. Thompson says there are spay suits available that serve the same purpose while giving your cat some additional freedom of movement. Try the Suitical Recovery Suit for Cats.\n\nComfortable bedding: Your cat will need a quiet, safe, and comfortable place to rest. If you don’t already have a designated place, consider something like the Frisco Sherpa Self-Warming High-Walled Bolster Small Cat Bed or Armarkat Cuddler Cat Bed.\n\nSunGrow Post-Surgery Soft Cone Dog & Cat Recovery Collar\n\n$12.72\n\nSuitical Recovery Suit for Cats\n\n$28.00\n\nFrisco Sherpa Self-Warming High-Walled Bolster Small Cat Bed\n\n$10.76\n\nArmarkat Cuddler Cat Bed\n\n$20.99\n\nCat Spay Side Effects\n\nFortunately, serious complications from spaying a female cat are quite rare. Like any surgical procedure, though, some risks are involved. Potential complications include reactions to anesthesia, bleeding, infection, and issues with wound healing.\n\nMonitor your cat for:\n\nExcessive bleeding\n\nSwelling\n\nRedness\n\nDischarge at the incision site\n\nSigns of pain\n\nLethargy\n\nLoss of appetite\n\nVomiting\n\nDiarrhea\n\nDifficulty urinating\n\nContact your veterinarian immediately if you notice any concerning symptoms.\n\nCat spaying is an essential responsibility for pet parents, and there is no reason to not spay your cat. Spaying ensures the health and well-being of your feline companions while also being mindful of the broader impact on animal welfare.\n\nMake sure to follow your veterinarian's instructions for post-operative care to ensure a smooth recovery for your cat—and don’t forget lots of cuddles, too!\n\nSpaying Cats FAQs\n\nQ: Where can I get my cat spayed?\n\nA:\n\nYou can get your cat spayed at most veterinary clinics. Additionally, many animal shelters and rescue organizations offer low-cost spay and neuter services. They can provide you with information about cat spaying and may even offer financial assistance.\n\nExpert input provided by Jessica Thompson, DVM, a veterinarian at Vista Pet Hospital in Portland, Oregon; Abel Gonzalez, DVM, a San Luis Obispo, California-based veterinarian.\n\nThis content was medically reviewed by Chewy veterinarians.\n\nBeWell",
      "# [Pet Turtles 101: A Beginner’s Guide to Keeping Turtles and Tortoises by Yvonne Villasenor on 2024-06-20](https://be.chewy.com/pet-turtles/)\nWith their stunning patterns, large eyes and little feet, plus their slow movements, lovable personalities and incredible longevity, it’s easy to see why turtles make fascinating pets. But what’s the best way to care for them? We spoke with veterinary experts about every aspect of basic pet turtle care, from diet and habitat to what to do when they’re sick.\n\nTurtles and Tortoises: Overview\n\nOrder: Testudines (or Chelonia)\n\nTurtles (aquatic, semi-aquatic)\n\nFamily: Emydidae\n\nSize: 3.5-12 inches, depending on the species\n\nLifespan: 20-60+ years\n\nTortoises\n\nFamily: Testudinidae\n\nSize: 4 inches to 6 feet, depending on the species\n\nLifespan: 25-100+ years\n\nFun Turtle Facts\n\nMany pet turtles live a very long life. Some tortoises have lived to over 100 years old!\n\nTurtles have a good sense of hearing and are able to recognize their keepers.\n\nTurtles can see in color and prefer to eat colorful food items.\n\nTurtles in cold places can slow their heart and metabolism down during the winter. This decreases their need for oxygen, so they can spend the entire winter living beneath the ice of a pond.\n\nThe easiest way to tell the difference between a turtle and a tortoise is that turtles are water-dwelling creatures with webbed feet or flippers, and tortoises are land-dwelling creatures with more elephantlike feet. Most turtles are more omnivorous (feeding on both plant and animal sources), while generally all tortoises are herbivorous (eating plant sources only).\n\nTurtle and Tortoise Supply Checklist\n\nTank or enclosure\n\nUVB light\n\nBasking light\n\nBasking dock\n\nHeat lamp\n\nInfrared thermometer\n\nAquarium water heater\n\nCanister water filter\n\nSiphon\n\nTank substrate\n\nWater conditioner\n\nWater test kit\n\nTank decor\n\nTurtle food\n\nAdditional items for tortoises:\n\nHumidity control\n\nFood dish\n\nCalcium supplement\n\nMultivitamin\n\nScreened lid\n\nHabitat\n\nA turtle’s habitat requirements vary depending on their species. Price Dickson, DVM, a veterinarian specializing in birds and reptiles at My Pet’s Animal Hospital in Lakeland, Florida, provides an overall guideline for slider turtles (e.g., species like red-eared slider turtles and yellow-bellied sliders), who get their name from the way they slide into the water to escape predators. She adds that most aquatic and semi-aquatic turtles also do well with these guidelines.\n\nImportant note: Different species of turtles and tortoises have different care requirements. Research your pet's species and speak with your vet to ensure you’re providing everything they need to be healthy and happy.\n\nEnclosure\n\nSmaller turtles can be kept in an indoor aquarium tank, whereas larger turtles do well outside in a fish pond, where they can get natural sunlight, Dr. Dickson says.\n\nIt’s important that turtles have plenty of room in their tank. For smaller turtles, the ideal tank size is 10 gallons (38 liters) of water per inch of shell length. So, a 4-inch turtle would need a 40-gallon tank.\n\nHave concerns about your turtle escaping? Fortunately, this isn’t much of a risk for indoor turtles, Dr. Dickson says. “They can’t climb steep, glass siding. So, as long as the water and basking area are more than a turtle-length from the top of the tank, they are unlikely to get out,” she explains.\n\nOutdoor turtles, however, are at a great risk of escaping. To prevent the chances of this happening, make sure that the pond they’re in is fenced in. The fence should be two to three times higher than the turtle’s length and extend below the soil line, as turtles can dig.\n\nREPTI ZOO 120-gal Wooden Reptile Terrarium\n\n$399.99\n\nFREE 1-3 day shipping\n\nTemporarily out of stock\n\nTetrafauna Aquatic Turtle Deluxe Aquarium Kit\n\n$192.01\n\nFREE 1-3 day shipping\n\nAivituvin 12.4-in Indoor & Outdoor Wood Tortoise House\n\n$89.98\n\nFREE 1-3 day shipping\n\nBedding\n\nThe type of bedding or substrate you choose to get for your pet turtle will depend on how you’d like to set up their tank.\n\n“The easiest is a large stone or gravel that is too large to fit in the turtle’s mouth,” Dr. Dickson says. Size matters here, because turtles may try to swallow their bedding, which can lead to medical problems. Using stones that your turtle literally can’t ingest eliminates that risk.\n\nLight and Decor\n\nEssential decor for pet turtle tanks includes a dock and a UVB light, Dr. Dickson says.\n\nA UVB-producing light should be placed over the dock. Turtles need UVB light so their body can produce vitamin D. The light also acts as a heat source so turtles can warm up. “As cold-blooded animals, keeping warm ensures that they can digest their food and that their immune system functions,” Dr. Dickson explains.\n\nA dock allows pet turtles to haul themselves completely out of the water and dry off. They also love to have a platform for basking in their UVB light.\n\nDecor to avoid placing in your turtle’s tank includes anything that they could easily swallow, such as plastic plants with small leaves, which can be mistaken for food.\n\nZoo Med Repti Tuff Splashproof Halogen Reptile Terrarium Lamp\n\n$7.19\n\nTemporarily out of stock\n\nZoo Med Aquatic Turtle UVB & Heat Lighting Kit\n\n$56.77\n\nFREE 1-3 day shipping\n\nTemporarily out of stock\n\nPenn-Plax Floating Turtle Pier Platform\n\n$29.98\n\nHeat Lamp\n\nA heat lamp is important for pet turtles to bask and maintain their body temperature, Dr. Dickson says. The strength of the lamp depends on how far away it is from the turtle.\n\nInfrared Thermometer\n\nTo assess the actual temperature of the basking area, Dr. Dickson recommends an infrared thermometer. Once you know the temperature, you can move the heat lamp closer or get a stronger one, if needed. Most semi-aquatic turtles like basking temperatures of 85-95 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nCleaning\n\nDr. Dickson says a pet turtle tank needs a complete water change every week or two—but that alone isn’t enough. Because turtles are messy—they eat, pee and poop in their water—they also need a strong canister water filter. A water conditioner should also be used to eliminate the chlorine in the tap water.\n\nIn addition to weekly tank cleanings, the filter needs to be cleaned every two to three weeks with a turtle-safe cleaner. The substrate should also be agitated (mixed up) and cleaned using a siphon during water changes to remove waste, and the tank walls cleaned of algae, Dr. Dickson advises.\n\nDiet\n\nWhat Do Turtles Eat?\n\nMany turtle species are omnivores and benefit from a varied diet, Dr. Dickson says. “The more variety, the better!”\n\nA young turtle’s diet should consist of about half protein and half vegetables. The vegetables should be chopped up into small pieces and sprinkled into the water, Dr. Dickson says.\n\nShe encourages pet parents to feed as much as their turtle will eat in 5-10 minutes, then scoop out the rest with an aquarium net. While it may be tempting to try to feed them in their basking area, Dr. Dickson says they must be fed in water, as they won’t eat anywhere else.\n\nThis can make giving powder supplements tricky. The good news is that most pet turtles won’t need supplements if you offer a balanced turtle pellet alongside their regular food every other day. Tortoises, on the other hand, typically need calcium and sometimes multivitamins as well. Talk to your veterinarian if you think your turtle needs additional nutrients, or if you’re concerned about their diet or how much they’re eating.\n\nSources of animal protein for turtles can include:\n\nWorms\n\nCrickets\n\nShrimp\n\nSnails\n\nOptional: Live fish (Dr. Dickson says not every turtle will want to make the effort to catch them.)\n\nAs for vegetables, nearly all leafy greens are safe, Dr. Dickson says. These can include:\n\nMustard greens\n\nDandelion greens\n\nCollard greens\n\nCarrot tops\n\nRomaine lettuce\n\nHow Often To Feed Your Turtle\n\nWhat you feed your turtle and how often will vary depending on their life stage.\n\nBaby turtles: Feed daily, and clean away any uneaten food after 5-10 minutes to maintain the cleanliness of their tank.\n\nAdult turtles: Feed every 2-3 days to prevent unwanted weight gain.\n\nDr. Dickson recommends feeding multiple brands of turtle pellets rotated weekly, as research is still ongoing as to the perfect nutrient requirements and each brand has a different blend.\n\nZoo Med Natural Aquatic Maintenance Formula Turtle Food\n\n$14.79\n\nFluker's Buffet Blend Aquatic Turtle Food\n\n$5.31\n\nWater Requirements\n\nTurtles don’t need a separate drinking source due to living in water, which should be kept clean and filtered, Dr. Dickson says.\n\nUnlike some reptiles, turtles have a bladder and urinate. Because of this, nitrogen from their urine can build up in their water. When doing a water change, it’s important to test the water quality to keep your turtle’s tank in a healthy condition. (More on that below.)\n\n“Testing the water quality makes sure that harmful waste products aren’t building up in the water,” Dr. Dickson says. “This also makes sure that the water filter is operating appropriately, as turtles are very messy and dirty their water quickly.”\n\nFollow the instructions on your water test kit, and ask your veterinarian if you have any questions about your results.\n\nHarmful Foods for Turtles\n\nAlthough turtles can enjoy a variety of vegetables, fruits, live food and plants, there are some foods they should never eat.\n\nExamples of common foods that are bad for turtles include:\n\nAvocados (leaves and seeds)\n\nGarlic\n\nOnions\n\nToxic insects, such as fireflies\n\nDr. Dickson advises against feeding your turtle any wild-caught insects, as they can contain pesticides or toxic plant material.\n\nHandling\n\nWhen handling turtles, it’s always best to pick them up slowly with both hands and hold them firmly from the sides between their front and back legs, says Doug Mader, MSc, DVM, a triple board-certified veterinary specialist and author of “The Vet at Noah’s Ark.”\n\nHe encourages turtle keepers to be careful when handling their pet, as some turtles have sharp claws and may accidentally scratch if they struggle. Additionally, they may bite if fingers are near their mouth or head.\n\nHe also points out that it’s important to never turn your turtle upside down when handling them unless it’s absolutely necessary. Being turned upside down is stressful for turtles and can damage their internal organs.\n\n“Once a turtle gets to know the pet parent, they will not struggle to get away and will remain calm during handling,” Dr. Mader says. He adds that a turtle’s shell is very sensitive, and they actually relish being petted and scratched. (Try using a soft brush on their shell!)\n\nA major concern with turtles is that they can carry salmonella, a type of bacteria that can pose a significant risk of infection and illness when transmitted to humans. Dr. Mader says proper handling of turtles and appropriate hygiene practices like handwashing can be effective in preventing the spread of salmonella.\n\nStill, Dr. Mader says turtles shouldn’t be given to very young children and others who may have chronic health issues. Consult your family physician to learn if a pet turtle is safe for your child.\n\nHealth\n\nSigns of a Healthy Pet Turtle\n\nKnowing the signs of a healthy turtle is essential to being able to tell how your scaly pal is feeling.\n\nSigns of a healthy turtle, according to Dr. Mader, include:\n\nClear eyes with a sparkle\n\nA pink oral cavity\n\nA clean nose\n\nHealthy-looking skin\n\nA clean, hard shell\n\nClean, sharp toenails\n\nHealthy feces (whitish, chalky urate and a dark brown, pasty fecal pellet for turtles; firm, brown feces for tortoises)\n\nA body weight within their species’ normal range (according to your veterinarian)\n\nActive\n\nWalks upright lifting their body off the ground with nice, high steps (i.e., not dragging themselves along the ground)\n\nCommon Health Problems in Pet Turtles\n\nCommon health problems in pet turtles include:\n\nSevere nutritional diseases due to an unbalanced diet\n\nSwollen eyes from a lack of sufficient vitamin A\n\nSoft shells from a lack of vitamin D and calcium\n\nInternal parasites and systemic illness due to dirty, unsanitary living conditions and poor water quality\n\nWhen To See Your Vet\n\nTurtles “are masters at hiding signs of illness,” Dr. Mader says, “and when they get sick, it usually progresses slowly over a long period.”\n\nSigns of an ill turtle can include:\n\nNasal discharge\n\nSwollen, puffy eyes\n\nEyes constantly being shut\n\nBubbles from the nose\n\nOpen-mouth breathing\n\nSwollen ears\n\nLethargy\n\nDecrease in or loss of appetite\n\nNot walking upright\n\nDiarrhea\n\nA soft shell\n\nFloating unevenly in the water\n\nDr. Mader recommends that pet turtles get yearly checkups for regular physical examinations. This will consist of monitoring your turtle’s weight, fecal testing for parasites and, if needed, blood work or other laboratory testing.\n\nThe best way to find a turtle vet is to visit the Association of Reptile and Amphibian Veterinarians website, select the “Find a Vet” tab (under For Owners) and choose from a list of reptile vets near you.\n\nFAQs About Pet Turtles\n\nQ:\n\nDo turtles make good pets?\n\nA:Yes! Dr. Dickson says turtles can be great pets who come to know their keepers and are fun to watch. Turtle keepers should be mindful that all their pet turtle’s needs are taken care of, that they have enough space and that they can live to 60 years—and maybe even longer.\n\nQ:\n\nHow long can pet turtles live?\n\nA:Depending on the species, pet turtles can live 20-60 years. Tortoises live even longer, with some species living 100 years or more!\n\nQ:\n\nAre turtles or tortoises better pets?\n\nA:It depends. Turtles make better pets for people with limited outdoor space. Tortoises benefit from living outdoors once they’re large enough to do so safely and the temperatures are appropriate.\n\nIt’s vital to research the kind of care an exotic pet like a turtle needs to thrive. Because there are multiple species of turtles to choose from, consider which best fits your preferences and is most compatible with your lifestyle, no matter whether it’s a terrestrial (land), semi-aquatic or aquatic pet turtle.\n\nNeed a name for your new pet?

      "# [The 200 Best Horse Names by Monica Weymouth on 2021-09-30](https://be.chewy.com/horse-names/)\nWhat’s in a name? When it comes to horse names, plenty!\n\nIn the United States, racehorses must be registered with The Jockey Club, which has extremely strict naming requirements. For example, your show name must be completely original, having never been used by another registered horse. Racehorse names also can’t be more than 18 characters long, use only initials, or contain the name of a famous person or trademarked brand without their approval. These restrictions lead to those memorable Kentucky Derby names, such as Carpe Diem, Oscar Nominated and Imawildandcrazyguy, to name a few.\n\nWhen it comes to pet horses, however, you’re free to pick any name you’d like.

Something along the lines of Sir Humphrey Who-Eats-Bananas of Hoppington Hollow. If that seems a bit much, perhaps you just want to add an honorific like Mr., Mrs., Miss, Sir, Lady or Lord. You can also opt to add an actual title like Prince, Princess, Queen or King. After all, your pet is whatever you choose him or her to be in your realm.\n\nI hope this got your mind brimming with ideas and you soon find the perfect name for your rabbit pal! Once you have the name nailed down, don’t forget to pick up all of the necessary rabbit supplies. Product essentials include a cage; rabbit pellets; hay; treats and toys.\n\nLearn even more about getting a rabbit:"

I left it outside and dreaded calling customer service and how I would probably have to tell my story to lots of people that are not fluent in English and would have to argue to get a refund…even if I got a refund, what am I going to feed my dogs?  Should I send my son to Petsmart and pay so much more?   I called and was pleasantly surprised when a very nice representative apologized and said he would be happy to send me a replacement and he promptly sent me the dog food and chews, I was so pleased.

It’s extremely rare, but any time something is wrong they resolve the problem completely without hesitation. There is no automated message when you call. Of the dozens of times I’ve called, a human in America has answered by the second ring. They’re friendly and always ask about my cats by name. A few times I’ve had to tell them about one who had passed away, a few days later I get a hand written sympathy card from them. \nOrdering prescription food and medicine is a breeze. You place the order online, they call the vet for authorization, and they always ship immediately. \nThey have a service where you can have a 20 minute virtual vet visit for 20.00. I’ve used it many times. I’ve used it after having an in-person visit and then think of more questions afterward, doesn’t that always happen? I’ve been able to send them pictures, X-rays and bloodwork results. They read them for me and help me understand whatever I didn’t understand at the office. These vets are great and always finish up by sending a summary of the visit and their recommendations. And they send relative articles for your information. I’ve tried the free nurse line through my pet insurance, all they do is tell you to go to the vet. Chewy’s vets actually help you avoid an office visit and will only send you if they know it’s necessary. \nThank you for everything, Chewy!! 😻",

They said they will refund me the full amount. I said “how will I return it to you guys?” She replied-donate it to a local shelter. I have never seen a company actually care about anything other than themselves. Chewy cares about your animals needs, and all the others that might not have found a home yet. That is something I think so highly of and I hope others do as well. Thank you Chewy for having the morals that you do.",

I’m not a huge fan of ordering things that I can buy in the store, but their prices are competitive, they have a huge variety of products, and recommend and remind you of vet visits when it’s that time again. Bonus: your orders are stored so if your animal loves something but you can’t remember the name or product you can just review your history. The only downside I’ve experienced so far is their packages must go thru the RINGER when shipping because every box I’ve received has been mangled and close to falling apart 🤣😅 the merchandise itself was fine, but that box must’ve been bunt kicked any time it needed to move 😭🤷‍♀️",

They are amazing with their customers. We got our new kitten a little less than 1.5 years ago and we weren’t sure what she was going to end up eating at first. As soon as we brought her home, we ordered the same wet & dry food that her breeder had been feeding her. As she started displaying various neurological symptoms, she began eating less and struggling to chew food. We became worried about giving her any wet food that wasn’t the consistency of baby food because she was starting to cough when she was eating. At about 6 months old, her vet sedated her to make sure there was nothing in the way of her throat. While at her visit, the vet fed her a Rx diet food that she absolutely loved by comparison to the wet food we were giving her. By switching to the prescription wet food exclusively, she started putting on weight again…even though she remained very small. Chewy helped us make the switch by running it through her vet’s office for the authorization of the Rx food. Then, they refunded us for the remaining wet and dry food that she’d stopped eating. This site even recommended that we donate the remaining food we had to a locate shelter or humane society (after they’d refunded us in full for the cost of this food). The people who answered the phone really showed us how much they cared about not just our little one, but about encouraging their customers to donate the refunded food to help local animal populations when other companies would have insisted the food be shipped back to them, even if they only ended up throwing it out or destroying it. \nI trust them with all of our purchases for kitty, Sadie. They free us up to focus on giving her whatever diet best supports her health. This has been so helpful as we’ve adjusted to her changing needs. They even sent us a card and a toy after hearing about Sadie’s difficulties! It’s rare to find a company that legitimately cares for their customers. \nI love this company and I’ll remain a customer forever. \nThanks to Chewy and all the representatives who work for them by answer the phone. This company behaves in such a refreshingly empathic way. I recommend them to everyone I ever talk to about their pets. \n\nJen, Ephraim & Sadie",

The Customer Service are absolutely fantastic!!  Mistakes happen, orders come late or sometimes are wrong but I have no problem calling Chewy customer support because I know the problem will be resolved immediately and they will always go the the extra mile to make sure their customers are completely satisfied, happy and never have to spend time on the phone with someone who is rude and reads from a binder refusing to help.  Amazon customer service could learn what true customer service is.  \nOn a personal note.  Earlier this year, my dog “Bo” was senselessly attacked and stabbed as a result.  His emergency vet bills were extremely expensive and I needed to cancel my Chewy Auto Ship.  It wasn’t caught in time and part of the order already was in transit.  The customer service team told me not to worry and just keep the item in transit.  I couldn’t believe the kindness and generosity of Chewy.  Thankfully my dog Bo recovered but it was a horrific experience.  \nA few days after the incident, a package arrived from Chewy in the mail.  It was a Beautiful Get Well gift and Card for my dog Bo.  It had a lovely handwritten note and was personally signed by the customer care team.  Me and my family were and still are so grateful and deeply touched by such a wonderful gesture from a large corporation.\n\nI hope the Corporate realizes how lucky they are to have such wonderful people who make an impact in a world where people like me have a lot of choices where we spend our money.  Since this incident, I recommend Chewy to everyone!  I work in animal rescue and constantly brag about your amazing people.  I know I am just one person but I would rather pay higher prices and have better service than deal with awful service, like Amazon for example.\nThank you",

I started using them because I wanted to get my kitty a better quality food but she ended up not liking it and I was stuck with an un opened box. I used the chat in app to request a return which was answered almost immediately and was super easy to use. The woman who helped me (Kandace C.) was so nice and said that there was no need to ship anything back and to donate my extra food to a local shelter 🥹. I thought this was so cool and thoughtful and solidified my love for chewy. They are a really cool company and buying food on here is way easier and cheaper than in store and with auto ship it comes right when she is running low so there is no stress of having to make time to pick up more food. I could not recommend chewy enough. Truly a great company I will be using them for life!",

It’s extremely rare, but any time something is wrong they resolve the problem completely without hesitation. There is no automated message when you call. Of the dozens of times I’ve called, a human in America has answered by the second ring. They’re friendly and always ask about my cats by name. A few times I’ve had to tell them about one who had passed away, a few days later I get a hand written sympathy card from them. \nOrdering prescription food and medicine is a breeze. You place the order online, they call the vet for authorization, and they always ship immediately. \nThey have a service where you can have a 20 minute virtual vet visit for 20.00. I’ve used it many times. I’ve used it after having an in-person visit and then think of more questions afterward, doesn’t that always happen? I’ve been able to send them pictures, X-rays and bloodwork results. They read them for me and help me understand whatever I didn’t understand at the office. These vets are great and always finish up by sending a summary of the visit and their recommendations. And they send relative articles for your information. I’ve tried the free nurse line through my pet insurance, all they do is tell you to go to the vet. Chewy’s vets actually help you avoid an office visit and will only send you if they know it’s necessary. \nThank you for everything, Chewy!! 😻",

The only downside I’ve experienced so far is their packages must go thru the RINGER when shipping because every box I’ve received has been mangled and close to falling apart 🤣😅 the merchandise itself was fine, but that box must’ve been bunt kicked any time it needed to move 😭🤷‍♀️",

      "# Amazing Customer Service!!, 5 stars [(jrosenberg21, Apple App Store, 2024-09-12)](https://apple/11718248694)\nThis is my favorite website with which to do business. They are amazing with their customers. We got our new kitten a little less than 1.5 years ago and we weren’t sure what she was going to end up eating at first. As soon as we brought her home, we ordered the same wet & dry food that her breeder had been feeding her. As she started displaying various neurological symptoms, she began eating less and struggling to chew food. We became worried about giving her any wet food that wasn’t the consistency of baby food because she was starting to cough when she was eating. At about 6 months old, her vet sedated her to make sure there was nothing in the way of her throat. While at her visit, the vet fed her a Rx diet food that she absolutely loved by comparison to the wet food we were giving her. By switching to the prescription wet food exclusively, she started putting on weight again…even though she remained very small. Chewy helped us make the switch by running it through her vet’s office for the authorization of the Rx food. Then, they refunded us for the remaining wet and dry food that she’d stopped eating. This site even recommended that we donate the remaining food we had to a locate shelter or humane society (after they’d refunded us in full for the cost of this food). The people who answered the phone really showed us how much they cared about not just our little one, but about encouraging their customers to donate the refunded food to help local animal populations when other companies would have insisted the food be shipped back to them, even if they only ended up throwing it out or destroying it. \nI trust them with all of our purchases for kitty, Sadie. They free us up to focus on giving her whatever diet best supports her health. This has been so helpful as we’ve adjusted to her changing needs. They even sent us a card and a toy after hearing about Sadie’s difficulties! It’s rare to find a company that legitimately cares for their customers. \nI love this company and I’ll remain a customer forever. \nThanks to Chewy and all the representatives who work for them by answer the phone. This company behaves in such a refreshingly empathic way. I recommend them to everyone I ever talk to about their pets. \n\nJen, Ephraim & Sadie",

The Customer Service are absolutely fantastic!!  Mistakes happen, orders come late or sometimes are wrong but I have no problem calling Chewy customer support because I know the problem will be resolved immediately and they will always go the the extra mile to make sure their customers are completely satisfied, happy and never have to spend time on the phone with someone who is rude and reads from a binder refusing to help.  Amazon customer service could learn what true customer service is.  \nOn a personal note.  Earlier this year, my dog “Bo” was senselessly attacked and stabbed as a result.  His emergency vet bills were extremely expensive and I needed to cancel my Chewy Auto Ship.  It wasn’t caught in time and part of the order already was in transit.  The customer service team told me not to worry and just keep the item in transit.  I couldn’t believe the kindness and generosity of Chewy.  Thankfully my dog Bo recovered but it was a horrific experience.  \nA few days after the incident, a package arrived from Chewy in the mail.  It was a Beautiful Get Well gift and Card for my dog Bo.  It had a lovely handwritten note and was personally signed by the customer care team.  Me and my family were and still are so grateful and deeply touched by such a wonderful gesture from a large corporation.\n\nI hope the Corporate realizes how lucky they are to have such wonderful people who make an impact in a world where people like me have a lot of choices where we spend our money.  Since this incident, I recommend Chewy to everyone!  I work in animal rescue and constantly brag about your amazing people.  I know I am just one person but I would rather pay higher prices and have better service than deal with awful service, like Amazon for example.\nThank you",

I hear great stories about them and how much they actually care about pet owners. They have a super wide selection of items at good items and our kittens have loved everything from Chewy we’ve ordered. HOWEVER there is one glitch in the app that’s making it near impossible for me to use. Whenever you are browsing items and select one, once you go back to your search results, they’re gone and you have to do the search all over again. This happens when you click through their preset categories to browse too, every time you go in/out of an item it takes you back too far. Please fix this! It makes it so much harder to find what I’m looking for and you deserve 5 stars otherwise!",

And he loved TikiDog wet food. But he wouldn’t touch the Tikidog dry lamb. I let Chewy know and they refunded me. I assumed they were then going to ask me to drop off the refunded product somewhere but instead they said to donate it to a shelter. So I did. Their chat service is very helpful. I even messaged them at midnight once because I kept forgetting to during the day and their response is fast. \n\nI’ve only had one order mess up in the 7 months I’ve been a customer.

In February a Chewy box that was delivered had a shard of glass under the label that punctured my finger deeply. It had to be glued closed, ended up getting infected and needing more treatment, and because I'm a massage therapist I was out of work for a week. After going back and forth with them for a while they simply stated \"we won't be doing anything for you\". Like not even a coupon or something?? It was a freak situation, and I know it's not their negligence necessarily... But it left a bad taste in my mouth and I just don't want to give them my money anymore. Any suggestions are much appreciated, thanks. 🙏\n\n\nETA: I shouldn't be surprised I suppose, but the amount of people who are pissed about this post (why?) and are now looking through my comment history is kind of wild. Even pulling quotes. You guys should take a break, Reddit must be raising your blood pressure and I worry for your health. (Though at least one of them is someone I know in real life that for some reason loves to reply to me on Reddit with new accounts to say mean shit.) \n\nNote to self: don't ask for help on Reddit. Sheesh.\n\nAll of the costumer service reps I spoke with over the course of several weeks -- who contacted ME by the way -- were absolutely lovely. It was the big kahuna at the end who first wanted me to send him ask my info, then called back two minutes later to say flatly that they would not be doing anything. I did feel a little guilty asking for help but big companies have insurance and what if it was a kid that got cut? This incident was not my fault, and my finger still feels like there's something in it. Nothing in my order was glass. I can't say I trust corporations much anyway, but yes, Chewy seems to be one of the nicer ones. I just don't feel good about giving them my money anymore, what can I say?\n\nThank you very much to the MANY more people here who have been so kind and helpful. I appreciate your time, and your suggestions. 🙏\n\n## Comment ID l13rh4y with +56 score by [(Benicetome23, Reddit, 2024-04-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/1cbzc1f/alternatives_to_chewy/l13rh4y/) (in reply to ID 1cbzc1f):\nIm surprised.

You may need an attorney in order to be successful in doing so, but this claim would be paid out and you'd be compensated for at least the hospital bills. Their insurance may subrograte to FedEx, but that's for them to handle and determine who is ultimately the at fault party.\n\n#### Comment ID l13swa1 with +7 score by [(Benicetome23, Reddit, 2024-04-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/1cbzc1f/alternatives_to_chewy/l13swa1/) (in reply to ID l13sjt5):\nJeez i would have thought they would have given you a credit or something.

It sucks! \n\nI am not trying to change your mind on finding a new supplier, I imagine that even Chewy would prefer you do so as they probably see you as a liability to them.  But I am surprised that it isn't incredibly obvious to you and everyone why Chewy wouldn't do anything for you. \n\nChewy could not give you so much as a coupon because in a legal situation a lawyer would absolutely try to argue that their doing so was an admittance of guilt.  The fact that you called a lawyer is proof that they were right to not give you anything. There is no likely way to prove where the glass came from or even if that is where your cut came from; pictures wouldn't be enough. It could, for example, be argued that you could have cut yourself on a tool you used to open the package or on other broken glass in your home. Even if under the label, glass could've worked its way there in shipping and also packages often have to be re-labeled during shipping. If you'd have injured yourself in an actual store, there are security cameras and witnesses and such that would make fault much easier to prove. Chewy would have to be incredibly foolish to take any accountability for something that can't likely be proven. Just as it is your responsibility to look out for your best interests, it is their responsibility to look out for their best interests.

But feel free to delete if this is really the wrong place!)\n\nBased on my two recent experiences, I’m convinced this is the best company out there and I’d love to hear more good tales about them just to keep my good faith. \n\nI recently ordered the wrong type of leash for my dog. Asked about a return/exchange. They said, “we’ll refund you, but don’t worry about returning it. Just donate it to a local shelter or rescue!”\n\nAmazing! I will!\n\nThen I ordered the right type of leash and then accidentally sent me two. So I send a message saying “it’s no skin off my back since I didn’t pay for two, but if you want it back I’ll send it back.” And they were like “oops! Accidents happen. Go ahead and donate it to a shelter or rescue.”\n\nLike, I’m sure they get some sort of write off for this. And both leashes together were not even $35 they lost. But how often does this happen? Do the little things adding up not make as big of a dent in their profits as it’s worth? They could easily ask for these things back and keep their stock up so they can resell them. But they’re choosing to let me donate them instead?\n\nSeems like a really good company and it makes me feel better about ordering from them instead of shopping at my local pet store, which didn’t carry the leash I needed anyway, but I felt bad nonetheless.\n\n\n\n## Comment ID hui0bdr with +51 score by [(rike103, Reddit, 2022-01-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/sea3aa/anyone_have_a_good_experience_with_chewy/hui0bdr/) (in reply to ID sea3aa):\nChewy is awsome they messed up on my order the first time and made it up by not only giving me an extra bag of food but they threw in some treats,they occasionally throw free stuff with my orders\n\n## Comment ID hui18i1 with +66 score by [(atlantisgate, Reddit, 2022-01-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/sea3aa/anyone_have_a_good_experience_with_chewy/hui18i1/) (in reply to ID sea3aa):\nI appreciate that they are willing to do stuff like this, and I do order from them pretty often as a result. There have been a few orders here and there over the years that have had damaged product, or just little stuff like that that happens, and they are always hassle free for me to deal with when that crops up.\n\nI also have to shout out their fast shipping, especially as a car-free human. It's really great to have stuff I need get here fast when since not that easy for me to run out and pick something up.\n\nOn the other hand, I know they undercut vet's offices in drug pricing on purpose, and it's to their benefit to write off a $10 leash if they get a customer who will always get expensive prescriptions from them.\n\nThey can be a real pain in the ass with prescription information with vet offices. I once had trouble getting something filled, and my vet told me multiple times they HAD faxed the paperwork to Chewy, but Chewy kept telling me they needed my vet to respond; My vet showed me the logs and they absolutely were in the right. Lots of vets struggle with them.\n\nSo yes! In many ways a great company, especially for consumers. But also, no point in losing sight of the fact that they're still a giant company who can really give small businesses/clinics a headache!\n\n### Comment ID huk2n9q with +28 score by [(InvalidUserNemo, Reddit, 2022-01-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/sea3aa/anyone_have_a_good_experience_with_chewy/huk2n9q/) (in reply to ID hui18i1):\nJumping on the top comment.

The next day I got the most gorgeous bouquet of flowers and a sympathy card.  \n\nI have a friend whose shipment got delayed in shipping.  She contacted them about it. They refunded her money so she could get something locally while she waited for her shipment to arrive.  \n\nI see other comments that the pharmacy side has problems, but I haven’t encountered that yet, and my vet tells me to get some of our meds through them, so they don’t seem to be having trouble yet.  \n\nThat said, I still go to local small shops for treats and toys and stuff like that.

My wife and I are adopting a dog on Saturday. In preparation for our dog we shopped around to see which store would be cheapest for supplies. Between Amazon, Petsmart, Petco, and Chewy, Chewy was the cheapest by far, and had great reviews for their in house label. We ordered about $300 dollars worth of supplies. The shipment came in 4 different boxes. During shipment FedEx tracking noted 1 box was damaged. The bottle of urine cleaner had leaked or broken. We could tell because FedEx repackaged it and the cleaner was missing. Without us contacting Chewy support, Chewy resent the whole order. Not just the urine cleaner. We are talking $300dollars worth of stuff. I contacted support and informed them that all items were fine and we only needed the cleaner.

They sent me another flavor free of charge of the same brand an encouraged me to donate the remaining unopened cans to a shelter. They even added a little note for my dog saying they hoped he was feeling better and “ready to eat”\n\nAlso I don’t think it counts towards their tax since the donation isn’t coming from them . It’s coming from you to your shelter or rescue and not directly from their company. But I could be wrong. \n\nI genuinely think they are just a good company built but pet people for pet people.

Changed my password and unlinked all of my payment methods.\n\n### Comment ID icm09gz with +1 score by [(OkSheepherder6676, Reddit, 2022-06-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/tg0non/chewy_hack/icm09gz/) (in reply to ID i7jn8fm):\nthey placed the order with your address because they were likely testing out if the payment will actually go through successfully, and also to get an idea of roughly how much is available to spend. once they see that the order went through successfully, that’s when they place more orders but sent to other people’s shpg address\n\n## Comment ID i7naku5 with +2 score by [(YawnSpawner, Reddit, 2022-05-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/tg0non/chewy_hack/i7naku5/) (in reply to ID tg0non):\nDuring my dog's usual middle of night bathroom break I noticed 2 $30 orders for an address in upstate NY.

I'm peeved my two factor authentication didn't work through PayPal. I got ahold of Chewy to see who canceled the order, and they said PayPal. Chewy customer service told me this seems like a PayPal problem, but after reading the replies below it seems like a Chewy account problem.

They answered immediately, clearly not outsourced as it was the least frustrating fraud call I've ever experienced. I assumed this was brand new, today and they hadn't alerted anyone yet. Now I'm concerned they were aware. I'm wondering if their site had a vulnerability, maybe a former IT employee or pen tester (they test sites for penetration vulnerability, can be hired or freelance going off bug bounties), even a hacker. \n\nWhen white hat (good guy) hackers find vulnerabilities, they'll report it to the site, sometimes they'll earn a \"bug bounty\", like 'hey I found this, your IT Dept should repair it, I just saved you $$$, pay me for it').  On the other hand, someone could have found it, reported it, it wasn't acknowledged the way they felt they deserved, and they reposted the vulnerability for others to expose. And then there are the hackers who don't even try to report it, they just try to sell the vulnerability. It could be any number of things, but Chewy definitely needs to warn people and get ahead of it before the concealment ruins their customer trust reputation.\n\n## Comment ID i9i7ucl with +2 score by [(tessabelle227, Reddit, 2022-05-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/tg0non/chewy_hack/i9i7ucl/) (in reply to ID tg0non):\nSame thing happened to me today. $70 order for dog food to an address in Florida.

My debit card was linked to my account. Someone changed the email address and shipping address on the account. I was notified that my order was shipping and that I needed to update my credit card. I checked my account and there was a $78 charge pending. I called Chewy right away.  They cancelled the order immediately and it fell off of my account instantly.

Four random pet plushy toys were ordered and the order summary emailed to my wife, plus an earlier email noting that the account's email had been changed (to my wife's).\n\nThe fun wrinkle is: we do not have a Chewy account.\n\nBy studying the emails my wife got, and then calling Chewy customer service and talking to Noah, who was genuinely apologetic, I think the theory explained below (fraudulent seller working with compromised Chewy accounts) is maybe correct.\n\nSomeone's real Chewy account with a weak password becomes compromised by hacker.  Hacker changes the email address (and maybe shipping address) on the account, and then places orders for random stuff.  This is charged to the original account owner's PayPal / credit card.\n\nThe shipping address person is perhaps innocent, and the original account owner as well.\n\nBut what I'm unsure of is: I don't think Chewy supports 3rd party sellers (unlike Amazon).  So how does the hacker make $$$ out of this?\n\nSeparately, I noticed that the embedded links in the Chewy email do not use https, which is insecure.  Two strikes :)\n\n### Comment ID iq5swdy with +1 score by [(q_gurl, Reddit, 2022-09-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/tg0non/chewy_hack/iq5swdy/) (in reply to ID ibaobn8):\nThat is the theory I am going with also.

They placed two $45 orders for the same 2 Items (Treats + Dog Food) and shipped to separate addresses in Saint Joseph, MO and Belton, TX.

It may be related to a shady site, but I don't think the scammers are straight drop shipping since so many people are having identical scam orders sent to different addresses.My Chewy password was an old weak one that I have mostly stopped using, so I'm sure it was in a previous data breach. They also changed the email and pw for my account, but I still got order confirmations from both Chewy and PayPal. Chewy customer support was great and canceled the orders. It seems weird that PayPal is the preferred payment method, my guess is that the backend fraud checks for separate billing/shipping addresses is weaker with PayPal than with the stored credit cards, so more fake orders are getting through when they use PayPal.\n\n### Comment ID ici93hh with +2 score by [(OkSheepherder6676, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/tg0non/chewy_hack/ici93hh/) (in reply to ID icdcbzk):\ncorrect. when orders are paid with paypal, we don’t receive any billing address info in our system. 9 times out of 10 it bypasses our fraud prevention system unless the hacker is using a VPN, among a few other factors\n\n### Comment ID idim29l with +2 score by [(softerthings, Reddit, 2022-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/tg0non/chewy_hack/idim29l/) (in reply to ID icdcbzk):\nI noticed the same address set up.

They kept my name for the shipping addresses, but changed the email and password to my account after the orders were placed so I couldn't log in.  Customer Service was super helpful and was able to cancel 3 of the orders; unfortunately one was literally being boxed and shipped as we were talking, so that one she refunded me and tried to put a cancel on the delivery.

Another weird thing is in the chewy app at the top it says member since but showed yesterdays date. I’ve been a member for years. Chewy cancelled the orders and I closed the account for good measure. Keeping an eye on PayPal to make sure the charges don’t go through. \n\nIt looks like this has been going on for months but neither Chewy nor PayPal seem to be owning it or finding a way to correct and prevent it from happening to other people.\n\n### Comment ID idwx51b with +2 score by [(Spiker1986, Reddit, 2022-06-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/tg0non/chewy_hack/idwx51b/) (in reply to ID idsr2zn):\nHappened this morning to me.  Order of events appears  to be they got into the chewy account, changed the email address on my legit account from mine then set up a new one in my name so that you didn’t see the fraudulent emails when you first logged in.  PayPal notified me of the charge (and Amex in light of the amount) but the scammer then spam bombed me to try to hide the emails.  \nChewy fixed it and I suspect they got in from an old password compromised in another breach.  So I spent my morning changing any and all passwords\n\nTalk to chewy.  I suspect you’re still in the “new” account they created after changing the email on the old one\n\n### Comment ID ie003q5 with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-06-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/tg0non/chewy_hack/ie003q5/) (in reply to ID idsr2zn):\nSame here and PayPal completely denied it!!! \n\nThey said it wasn't unusual despite the name and part of the address - city, state and zipcode - being unusual from my consistent quarterly orders.\n\n## Comment ID idthlym with +2 score by [(SoggyChorizo, Reddit, 2022-06-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/tg0non/chewy_hack/idthlym/) (in reply to ID tg0non):\nThis just happened to me on June 22 for $120, I got my money back the next day, but I still am not able to access my account. The scammer changed my email, Chewy was able to put my email back, but my account is still disabled. Chewy said something about fraud department.\n\nHow long did it take for others accounts to be usable? I actually need dog food soon and don't really want to order dog food from Amazon.\n\nAlso, the theory about a fake pet store makes some sense. I looked up the guy who ordered from my Paypal, and he is 78 years old, don't really think he would know how to scam, but you never know. I am thinking of  reporting it to online fraud, maybe they can look into it further. He ordered \"Gentle Giants Canine Nutrition Chicken Dry Dog Food, 30-lb bag\" and some other stuff the emails won't show, and I found a bunch of ebay listings for it. So somewhere there is a list of chewy usernames and passwords circulating. Even if someone hasn't been hacked I would change your password asap.\n\n## Comment ID idv94wb with +2 score by [(S1DC, Reddit, 2022-06-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/tg0non/chewy_hack/idv94wb/) (in reply to ID tg0non):\nThis just happened to my ex-neighbor.

You have to go into your PayPal and look to see if Chewy is listed there.   People pay bills with \"reoccurring payments\" and 2 factor doesn't seem to apply to retailers/sites that are listed.  Payments will sail through.  [https://www.paypal.com/c2/smarthelp/article/FAQ2254](https://www.paypal.com/c2/smarthelp/article/FAQ2254)\n\nI think that's what's going on with people here.

I immediately called Chewy customer service and the rep said the order was pending so she could quickly and easily cancel it and remove my payment information (I use a card not PayPal when making Chewy orders) then do a password reset. I was nervous this person took down my personal info but so far the only charge on my card is the pending Chewy one that should be gone in a couple days due to cancellation, so hopefully this person just tried for some free dog food that she’ll never receive on my dime. I was hoping she didn’t have my card or contact info just somehow access to my account, unfortunately!

They also shipped a bag of treats to me- that's what tipped me off because I hadn't checked my email in a couple days. I wasn't expecting a package from Chewy today- I haven't ordered from them in a while. Luckily Chewy was super nice and super helpful and refunded (pending I haven't seen it yet) and these people also changed my email address AFTER they placed the orders so I was able to see the email confirmations- luckily she helped me with that too. Unlinked my PayPal in Chewy, turned Chewy off as automatic payments in PayPal, changed my PayPal password even though I don't think that was it- I have 2FA on my email and paypal (and anything important). I think it's something on Chewy's end but I'm just happy it was fixed and easy to fix.\n\n## Comment ID ia6cw1u with +1 score by [(Longjumping-Roof-693, Reddit, 2022-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/tg0non/chewy_hack/ia6cw1u/) (in reply to ID tg0non):\nJust happened to me as well.

Noticed a 3rd party seller was selling the food for like, $7 dollars cheaper than everywhere else. Went ahead and purchased it through that seller.\n\nWhen it showed up, it had a totally random name on it, but my address. I thought it was just an error with Amazon...but then this happened a week later. Like others have said, inbox was filled with spam emails and I missed the receipt initially but caught the tracking.\n\nI'm going to echo what someone else said on this thread -- both those receiving the packages and those getting charged might be victims -- 3rd party sellers are somehow gaining access to Chewy accounts, pocketing the money for the items they're reselling, and charging the Chewy accounts full price.\n\n**Did anyone else recently purchase something from a 3rd party seller, on Amazon or elsewhere, and have this happen? A quick check of the seller now reveals similar issues with other people's products being \"stopped in transit and returned to seller\" which is exactly what's going to happen to the person who purchased the products charged to my Chewy account.**\n\n## Comment ID ib115ka with +1 score by [(jvjamie1994, Reddit, 2022-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/tg0non/chewy_hack/ib115ka/) (in reply to ID tg0non):\nJust happened to me as well...

About 2 weeks ago, I ordered my dog's prescription food, which she's been on for almost 3 years and I received the fraud email. The c/s rep said she would release the order, which she never did. I had to call two days later and then spoke to someone who in turn THEN released the order. I asked them \"why doesn't your Fraud Dept. look at the order? It's a product I always buy and the name/address and pet name are the same?  Then last night, I received an email from Chewy stating the flea/tick preventative I ordered was flagged for fraud. I called c/s and she said she would contact her supervisor and the fraud department, but the item won't ship until later in the week. \n\nI realize Chewy is trying to be proactive here, but something isn't adding up.

Chewys website isn’t safe. \n\nIf you are super worried, cancel your card you had on there for payment and have them issue another. I changed my PayPal information, but I also had third party identification so if order anything it should have confirmed it was me by sending me a text with a password, which it didn’t. \n\nHonestly if I could get rid of PayPal I would.

      "# Post ID ggdkrq: I'm a Vet. Here's why I hate Chewy. [discussion] with +3142 score by [(PrinceofPersians, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/)\nNo, it's not the revenue loss.  Pretty much every vet who's not on the brink of retirement age has accepted the loss of the in-clinic pharmacy as an inevitability.  This post also isn't about online pharmacies in general.  I don't necessarily *like* Walmart, or 1-800-PETMEDS, or Allivet.  However, I *hate* Chewy.\n\nMy problem is the dishonesty.  You ever get one of those emails or calls where they say your vet hasn't approved the prescription?  Our clients sure did too.  In fact, Chewy accidentally sent us an email recently that was meant for clients:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Dear Pet Parent,  \n>  \n>Chewy is committed to your pet's health and happiness. Challenging times like these will never change that.  \n>  \n>We are actively working to contact your veterinarian to get your pet’s prescription approved, so we can deliver your pet’s essential medicine as fast as possible. Unfortunately, we haven't been able to get through as of yet.  \n>  \n>These are unprecedented times and it may be possible that your vet is extra busy or working reduced hours. If you’d like to help, you can also contact your veterinarian’s office to find out where they are with approvals.  \n>  \n>Your pet's well-being will always be our top priority and we’re doing everything we can to make sure your order goes through.  \n>  \n>We appreciate your support. Stay well and find moments of comfort with your pet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"We're working oh so hard on getting the prescription to you, if only your vet would approve it!\"\n\nWhat we found from several of our clients: on numerous occasions (or perhaps all), they were sending this email out the *second* they actually sent the email requesting approval from your vet.  Our clinic always printed out and took care of all approvals by noon the day the prescription requests came in.   Yet, we had always dealt with clients angry about how we weren't approving their scripts.  We would have to send approvals multiple times.  In fact we eventually had to disconnect our fax simply because sending Chewy scripts 3-4 times for each request clogged a free phone line and took up a lot of time.   Chewy tended to be the most egregious of the companies to do this.\n\nSo instead we stuck with emails which have convenient time stamps...and the ability to bcc them to the client :)\n\nSuddenly, when we started sending these emails to the client with a time stamp from both Chewy's email and our approval, they were calling Chewy instead of us to complain, yelling at customer service when they tried to call the client and claim we weren't approving it, or ditching Chewy altogether.  We got to see both sides ourselves too.  On one fun occasion, we didn't have a medication that our tech needed for her dog but could only order a 1000 count bottle, so she ordered from Chewy.  They didn't respond for about 5 days, then sent the first and only email approval to us at 5pm on a Saturday and then the email to our technician that they were unable to reach us after three attempts at about 7am the following morning.\n\nThen the demands came from Chewy for either verbal approval (no paper trail, and no accountability for them), or fax (a paper trail but difficult to send/prove to client, so in most cases, still no accountability for them).  On one occasion we denied both and told them via phone to email three times over the span of an hour, admittedly with some rudeness on the third, and they proceeded to try to send a fax through our phone line consecutively for 35 minutes straight.  I was doing an emergency surgery on a dog with a wound with a bad bleeder from the linguofacial vein while this was happening.  Needless to say, it was hard to concentrate on saving the patient but we couldn't disconnect the phone line in case another urgent call needed to be answered.  The dog did fine (for anyone worrying about this) :).\n\nAll of the dishonesty with the timing of approvals have been worse recently.  I suspect related to difficulty with supply in the COVID-19 crisis.  It's been tough for us too, and we've been honest with clients about this.  So with Chewy, I suspect that instead of saying \"we're having shipping delays\" or \"we're on backorder for that very common thing\", they're simply claiming the vet isn't responding while they deal with delayed arrivals/shipments.\n\nSo now they've stopped doing emails altogether.  They can do fax or verbal approval (again, no accountability), or a new option.  They have an online platform called Petscriptions (again from what their own customer service implied, communication on the timing of prescriptions had no accountability for them, they can say whatever they want).  Furthermore, with yours and our data becoming a more valuable resource, I don't want to make the data mining that every online company does even easier for them.\n\nI'm not writing this for the revenue.  You've all heard the \"shop local\" argument so many times I'd be beating a dead horse by saying it.  Money is tight, especially now.  And if you wanted to order online to save some money, I encourage you to do so.  I'm writing this because Chewy has peddled the idea that they genuinely *care* about your pets, through those occasional oil paintings from someone you and your dog have never met, to the kindhearted condolence texts that, when you read them with an objective eye, seem suspiciously formulaic, to the \"customer is always right\" level of pandering that you and I both know is harmful.  However, the stuff I described above is how they behave when dealing with a vital step in getting your pet the medication they need.  Given that this is one of those steps that you can't see, I think it's telling of how much they *actually* care about your pet.\n\nIt shouldn't need to be said that a corporation doesn't care about you or your fur-buddy, but here it is.  I only say this because there *are* people who care about your pet: you, your family, your neighbors (well, sometimes).   And yes, also your doggy daycare workers, your groomers, every worker at your vets office.  If we didn't care about your pet, we wouldn't have accepted far less money for the same work that human equivalents would make in all aspects.  So please, reserve your trust for the people who have actually tried to earn it, and don't let a group of people you've never met put a wedge between you.\n\nPeace, love, wags, and purrs,\n\nA pissed-off dogtor\n\ntl;dr: Chewy is a dishonest trainwreck that doesn't care about you or your pet any more than the other corporate online pharmacies (perhaps even less).\n\nEDIT: I'm sorry about not replying so long.  I work half days on Saturday and didn't feel right messing around on Reddit on shift.  A few things to add or discuss since I probably won't be able to reply to everything.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*FIRST AND FOREMOST\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*:  I got a message from a previous Chewy employee who will remain anonymous due to what you can see in the post:\n\n>Hey there! I worked for said company mentioned earlier (signed a kind of NDA) and I want you to know that you're right. I worked in customer service for almost a year before moving up, and I have to say that the company is BS. There was no communication between locations, and the longer we went on, the more people straight up ignored any communication without getting reprimanded.  \n>  \n>I hated working with vets, although I'm studying to be one, and I felt like crap after getting off the phone. Sometimes there would be a case floating around for a week, and no one cared to look at the \"email only\" notes or \"please call after faxing\"... It was embarrassing.  \n>  \n>I worked in the QA department for a while, but left after they refused to give me a raise, although I was the only person in the department with a degree and the knowledge of small animals,. exotics, and farm to keep the department going. No regrets. Terrible place for a person with an IQ over 35.  \n>  \n>Please don't share my name 😊\n\nI really appreciated that and just want to say that if this user stuck through all that (including some angry vets and techs and receptionists which I can sometimes be myself) then they've got the kind of tough our profession needs now more than ever :)\n\nSECOND:  Some people have brought up that their vet recommends Chewy or that their vet says they've never had a problem with them.  This may be true.  I do not know how the company works.  Perhaps its regional, perhaps its random.  But given that there is an employee here saying otherwise and numerous people in veterinary and human medicine confirming that this is a shared experience, I think it's safe to say that this is a widespread problem.  Furthermore, one should keep in mind that Chewy is owned by Petsmart, and Petsmart is in a partnership with Banfield.  I should also say that I don't know the status but I remember a previous attempt of a Banfield merger with Blue Pearl and VCA.  So the point here is that I wouldn't be surprised if some vets aren't allowed to bash Chewy or perhaps get financial incentive to send clients there specifically.   Or perhaps Chewy simply does better dealing with the clinics under their own umbrella.  Or it's nothing but coincidence, I'm a vet not a psychic.\n\nTHIRD: Yes, they have great customer service when speaking with you.  The point of this post is to discuss what happens to people who aren't the client and what happens to your prescriptions--that your pet needs--behind the scenes.\n\nI'll edit more as needed or try to respond better to comments individually but there are a lot more than I anticipated o\\_O\n\nBasically, just be wary of any company where you'll never be able to chat with the boss (and also be wary of that boss if you can chat with them).  For example, I hear Jeff Bezos is building an actual giant clock that's totally not a doomsday device in the middle of his desert mountain.  Anyways, please be safe, keep 6 feet distance from any of those gross \"other people\", and stay fuzzy, soldiers.\n\nEdit 2: I spelled bad :(\n\nEdit 3: We've got another employee.  Thank you very much  PoodlePopXX\n\n>As some one who worked for Chewy, they are an actual trash company. They treat their employee like garbage and they run unsafe warehouses. Everything and everyone is a number to them no matter who hard you work. Their attendance policy is a joke and is meant to push people out as quickly as they come in.  \n>  \n>Just one example, one night an industrial lithium battery exploded and caught fire. A good portion of the warehouse filled with dark black smoke that smelled terrible. People passed out, others couldn’t breath, and they didn’t want to open the doors or let people go outside and stop working for fresh air. The entire warehouse needed to keep working. People had headaches all night. Three people ended up hospitalized. They had to call ambulances. If you felt awful from the smoke inhalation and air quality you could choose to go home, but you’d have to take attendance points against your record. That’s the kind of company they are.  \n>  \n>I ordered from there often before I worked there. After I worked there I wouldn’t order from there if it was free.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Comment ID fq09ei4 with +527 score by [(endersendgame, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq09ei4/) (in reply to ID ggdkrq):\nAs someone who worked as a vet receptionist for 2.5 years I can say this is 100% true! There were days we fielded more calls from Chewy reps than clients looking for verbal approval on scripts they claim they had sent yet never did. Or angry clients claiming Chewy had told them they sent the request days ago and we never responded. It was infuriating! Our solution was to make Chewy resend the email or fax and never give verbal approval so we had a paper trail.

I’ve been in the industry almost 8 years now and it’s always been this way with chewy! I had a client order meds for 4 pets and chewy only sent the request for 2. Owner calls us yelling about how he paid for 4 exams for his dogs to get this done and we wouldn’t approve it correctly. I got into our system where we scan in and time stamp the approvals and could tell him that we had only received 2 and sent them back on such and such date and such and such time. He calmed down with me and than called chewy and yelled at them haha\n\n#### Comment ID fq0nx8k with +103 score by [(hitzchicky, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq0nx8k/) (in reply to ID fq0dayl):\nI'll never understand why people start a conversation with yelling.

Chewy and others have had issues with counterfeit product.\n\nChewy is known for fantastic customer service and that’s awesome!  However, please understand that vets have an ENTIRELY different experience with them.  We do not mind helping you get product at a lower cost because our primary goal is to keep your pets healthy!  I much rather your pet not get Lyme disease than sell you flea and tick product.\n\nJust know, it costs us time, money and frustration to have to deal with these pharmacies who are frequently hostile toward us.  It is a love/hate relationship.\n\nWe have to divert man power to lose money to pharmacies which is okay if it helps our patients. Fulfilling one script can take our techs up to 15 minutes as techs have to find the chart, ensure the medication is acceptable by checking the medical history, contact the owners (who usually don’t answer) to triple check that they have been on it for things such as heartworm, and then chase down a doctor to sign (usually with a patient). Once the vet has it, we have to review everything from medical history to dosage, and sign off.  Then it goes back to the tech who must send it off.  This occurs all while both the tech and doctor are seeing patients, performing surgeries, reviewing cases and performing our other job duties.  We do about 35 of these a day.  But I repeat, we will do it as long as you keep your pets on the medications they need!\n\nAlso, majority of us are not trying to rip you off.  Our prices are higher because we stock lesser quantities!  Always ask about rebates!\n\nOh god, this turned into a rant.  Sorry.\n\n### Comment ID fq133a1 with +6 score by [(codenameblackmamba, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq133a1/) (in reply to ID fq0khui):\nGreat tip about the rebates - my dog’s medication is 2x more expensive through the vet’s pharmacy compared to online suppliers, but all the online suppliers have been out of stock for a few months so we’ve had no choice.

I most certainly don't think my smaller vet clinic didn't approve it, they probably didn't see it yet or, perhaps they only approve things a certain time every day, so it can take longer then expected.  If I have an emergency type script, I'm not using chewy, as you can never get a large company to move their ass in matters that only are important to you. But you'll always have a better response from your vet. Even if I have to call my vet later, I'm assuming something was missed (on either side) and now that they're expecting it, after I call chewy, it should be fine. Of course, I worked in a Drs office for about 5 years, many years ago, so maybe that's why I'm not freaking out about these things.  Honestly, I expect to have these issues with Any company I might use for my pet's rx, as the company is only as good as the underpaid person requesting the approval. I also feel clear communication from the vet or staff can change the dialogue here.  Something like \"We'll get to the bottom of this, but I do want to let you know we've been having some problems with Chewy saying they did things that they didn't\".  It's not like you have to protect Chewy when they mess up.  I really hope you do tell your clients about these issues each time.  Chewy asks for feedback all the time, and if people were aware and reported these issues it's possible Chewy might get their head out of their ass.\n\n### Comment ID fq0wj5h with +7 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq0wj5h/) (in reply to ID fq0pxxg):\nI'm the same tbh.

They recommended trying 1-800 PET MEDS or Chewy as an option, so I went with Chewy since we already got kitty litter through them. \n\nCouple of things that went through my mind:\n\n1. I wish the vet office had told us they were no longer carrying the med BEFORE we were about to run out. Luckily with COVID, I was trying to stay a week ahead of things but normally I’d wait till a day before they’d run out. (This is more of a personal complaint than a Chewy complaint). But, I ordered ASAP and there was no lapse in medicine for the pup. \n\n2. I’d heard this about Chewy from friends who are vets. Also that the drugs aren’t “guaranteed” like they are at a vet’s office. That’s not the best word, but the best my brain could come up with. If the medicine doesn’t work/makes your pet sick,/etc., Chewy can’t/won’t do anything to right the wrong, whereas your vets office might. \n\n3. I went with Chewy because of ease, I already had an account with them. But I can change if it’s not the best option.\n\nVet workers of the world, knowing my vet’s office simply doesn’t carry the med anymore- would you recommend I reorder through 1-800 PET MEDS over Chewy?

They get an insane bulk discount. Vets don’t always carry the massive size bags because they will expire before they can sell them. If you ask reception at your vet office to special order you a specific size of food they 100% will. If it’s not a size they normally carry you can ask the office manger how much it would be before you place the order since they probably haven’t done the math on the price vs order price yet. \nThey just need a heads up cause every vet I’ve ever worked for has to place one big order at a time to get the free shipping so they wait until they have a order together.  \n\nAlso for pet parents starting a new prescription food a lot of people like to buy the small bags Incase the animal hates it. Also vets will fully 100% refund the price of the bag of food if you cat or dog refuses it. We can return the open bag of food to manufacture and get refunded. Win/win. Half the companies require us to send the food back the other half of companies don’t and we usually give those open bags of food away to clients who literally can’t afford anything.

Thanks for taking the time to share it. \n\nI have a great relationship with our vet—we’ve used them for over twenty years, through four dogs, three cats, a turtle and a snake; two dogs, two cats and turtle currently. Just a few years ago our oldest dog got a terrible infection that required several expensive meds and when the doc brought the ‘scrip out he said flat out to me that I could get it cheaper at the Walgreens down the street. I asked him what numbers we’re talking about and it was hundreds. \n\nThat kind of behavior between vets and patients builds trust and is one of the reasons I’ve been with my vets for over two decades. There’s also the great care and friendly staff. \n\nAnyway, what kind of chronic illnesses are animals dealing with that multiple animal pharmaceutical companies are required? Or are pets being over medicated? I’ve had nine animals over the past ~30 years, I get some animals have chronic conditions. What we’ve needed for our animals was reasonably priced at our vet or we found it at regular drugstores at a cheaper price. I also know my vet practice’s philosophy is low key and they have advised against medications for my animals—kitty Prozac for a particularly odd cat we have now. Understandably, that’s not a lot of evidence from which to extrapolate a cogent opinion on the issue, I just don’t get that kind of market for medications for pets.\n\n### Comment ID fq0bxhu with +13 score by [(Emulocks, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq0bxhu/) (in reply to ID fq060to):\nAccording to this website:\n https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-pet-statistics\n\nthere are almost 103 million cats and dogs owned as pets in the US.

Either they are bombarding us with several copies of the same request, or they are calling to complain that they haven't gotten anything from us, or they are bullying owners into peppering us with calls.

They treat their employee like garbage and they run unsafe warehouses. Everything and everyone is a number to them no matter who hard you work. Their attendance policy is a joke and is meant to push people out as quickly as they come in. \n\nJust one example, one night an industrial lithium battery exploded and caught fire. A good portion of the warehouse filled with dark black smoke that smelled terrible. People passed out, others couldn’t breath, and they didn’t want to open the doors or let people go outside and stop working for fresh air. The entire warehouse needed to keep working. People had headaches all night. Three people ended up hospitalized. They had to call ambulances. If you felt awful from the smoke inhalation and air quality you could choose to go home, but you’d have to take attendance points against your record. That’s the kind of company they are.\n\nI ordered from there often before I worked there.

I used to be a vet tech, and Chewy were okay about prescriptions, I think, but I never dealt with that side of it in the office, so I'm not sure. Even though I no longer work with my former employer, I still always get my pets' pain meds, flea and tick medicine, heartworm prevention, etc. from my vet of 20+ years, so I haven't had to deal with Chewy on the pharmacy front. But with just regular packages...even before coronavirus and not ordering near holidays, they were *always* late coming to my door. This is even with me ordering over $50 on stuff, which is supposed to mean I would get 2-day shipping. Instead, I would get packages a week or so later. I wouldn't have been so upset if they didn't have *huge* banners all over their website that said free 2-day shipping for orders over $50 lmao whenever I ordered stuff below $50, it would take even longer.\n\nNeedless to say, I no longer shop with them. I got tired of emailing them to ask where my stuff was, especially if it was time-sensitive (not prescription meds, but things like dog food because I was running low and only had maybe 3 days left, or even cosequin tablets that needs to be taken every day to remain effective -- my dogs not having any for 4+ days resulted in pain for my poor seniors). Keep in mind that I'm also disabled, so my packages being late could *really* fuck things up, since I can't just hop in the car and go to a physical store to get the things I needed.\n\n## Comment ID fq0g1br with +5 score by [(ningirl42, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq0g1br/) (in reply to ID ggdkrq):\nThank you for this information.

I’ve had trouble with Chewy from the get go just for fricking dog toys and the order being delayed for weeks.... and long before the current slow shipping pandemic situation.  My sister lives two hours south of me and she’s been a Chewy customer for a long time but recently gave up on them.  I’ve never gotten scripts for my critters from Chewy, Allivet is just a stone’s throw away so shipping has always been quite fast and they’re very good about getting approval WHEN their online selection of vets included our new doctor that is (had an issue with vet “not approving” the prescription....I sent an angry text to our vet but as it turns out, it was Allivet’s mistake because they’re system “reverted” to our former vet, who recently retired.  But we got it all straightened out and since (and long before) this situation, they’ve always done a great job.  I’ve never gotten vet meds from Walmart or any walk in pharmacy with the one exception of an eye “moisturizer” for my elderly basset hound, and the Walgreens pharmacist was kind enough to recommend an equally good but less expensive option.\n\nThat said, idk what’s been going on with Chewy but after my first experience I’ve been reluctant to ever order from them again, even like I said, for dog toys and an orthopedic pet bed....\n\nI know vets must be run off their feet right now and mine recently came to the house (but examined my pups in the garage, not inside) and I couldn’t believe she was kind enough to do this given the current social isolation scenario.  But I’m disabled and it’s very difficult to get 3 dogs in and out of the car (the largest of whom is 100+ pounds and has a deformed foot so jumping up is very painful) so her home visit was more appreciated than she’ll ever know.  I consider vets on the front line because even in quarantine, life for our critters goes on and they must be tended to like always....\n\nSo from the bottom of my heart, thank you for continuing to do your thing.....I for one (and I’m most definitely NOT alone) am forever grateful.\n\n### Comment ID fq33cwv with +1 score by [(PrinceofPersians, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq33cwv/) (in reply to ID fq31t94):\nThank you so much, that means a lot to us in general.

The only time I got the message was last month when I ordered food and they were upfront from the start that it would take a lot longer than usual and even gave me the option to cancel the order, 24 hours after it was placed, and no hoops to jump through. I’ve asked to return a bed that was too big for my dog and they said to donate it, which was great since I volunteer at a shelter and also foster. They even sent my dog a hand written birthday card. These things are trivial in the grand scheme of things but for people thinking this is the normal and plan to never use Chewy, just have your own experience before you decide. If my vet can figure out how to autoship her meds in 2 days for a pretty big discounted price without me ever having to make a single phone call, then I’ll consider buying from them instead.\n\n## Comment ID fq0hakr with +4 score by [(wellfuckmylife666, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq0hakr/) (in reply to ID ggdkrq):\nLol I seriously don't trust corporations and I don't think anyone should.\n\n## Comment ID fq02sjz with +4 score by [(BetsMomE, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq02sjz/) (in reply to ID ggdkrq):\nThank you for sharing this.

As someone with stable finances who (normally) shops online somewhat frequently there is just no reason for my card to ever decline. Every time I go to Chewy’s site to manually get them to run it again, I don’t have to provide any additional information and it will immediately work. I have been surprised by how illogical it is for them to not just try to run the card again if there’s a processing issue/problem connecting with the bank. Reading this has admittedly made me somewhat suspicious that this is a tactic to delay order processing. \n\nTo be honest it won’t impact my use of the service for the time being - before we were unable to pick up prescription food from our dog’s dermatologist because of our hours v. theirs, and now because our local government has asked us to avoid going anywhere we have to drive + we’re minimizing contact with people. We may have to look into whether another site carries our dogs’ prescriptions though.

We’d risk being in trouble part way through the year if she has an accident and there’s not enough left in the pot. \n\nIf vets were charging something more reasonable I’d go back in a heartbeat.\n\n### Comment ID fq25qj3 with +2 score by [(PrinceofPersians, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq25qj3/) (in reply to ID fq0qcdx):\nI can tell you that part of this is related to cost to acquire the meds.  I do know for a fact that corporate clinics such as VCA can get medications at less than half the cost that I can simply by working out deals with the companies to buy in bulk for x-amount of time.

I worked there for 2.5 years in their main customer service location as a customer service representative.\n\nYou are absolutely right, the RX team is awful. As a rep, we all hated having to assist that team, and when they launched their pharmacy with actual meds instead of just prescription food, it was a literal shit-show. A lot of departments at Chewy are run by younger people with little experience, with most management being between 20 and 30. [I'm in this bracket, so I'm not saying this was a bad thing, just maybe needed a few seaaoned managers]\n\nThe approval process is so stupid. Customer places order, order gets sent to RX, RX automatically sends a fax (if there's a fax number on file) to the vet. Then it sits in a queue until a person gets to it to make the phone calls to the vet's office. Any emails sent are usually automatic based on time. There used to be email options for the vet diet foods, but with medication, legally it's not valid. The RX team was so small when I was there, and when an angry customer calls in, we would have to reach out to that team to inquire about the status of their order. We as reps couldn't get the approval ourselves (unless it was food) so we couldn't even call the vet for the customer.\n\nIf you ordered on a weekend? Forget it, you'll get a bunch of emails becuase most vets are closed.\n\nChewy was amazing when I started. Then Petsmart bought it, and the 2 guys that created Chewy and their original team got quietly pushed out one by one. I should have left when they did.\n\nI'm sorry for anyone who has had a bad experience with Chewy. I miss how it was, when my days were spent helping happy people and talking about their pets, instead of having to apologize for FedEx and Lasership.\n\n## Comment ID fq0tmj9 with +2 score by [(tabby51260, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq0tmj9/) (in reply to ID ggdkrq):\nI also hate Chewy - but for an entirely different reason.\n\nThe one and *only* time I've ever gotten a piece of mail from them was within a week of putting my dog down. \n\nFuck Chewy.\n\n### Comment ID fq0w5vw with +4 score by [(asilentmurder, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq0w5vw/) (in reply to ID fq0tmj9):\nDid Chewy know you lost your dog?

My dog is on special prescription food now, and my vet told me to either go through Chewy or a store like PetSmart because they were out of the food at their practice. I went through Chewy for the first order, and it was all approved by them and my vet within a few hours. However, I'm not surprised my vet recommended them since they're a very small practice and they tend to carry a limited supply of medicines and food.\n\nI'm wondering too if Chewy maybe prioritizes certain practices over others? Like, maybe ones they like are given priority and ones they don't are thrown in the \"if we're falling behind, send a notice that the vet is taking forever\" pile.\n\nOne thing I will say -- I don't understand anyone who would jump to calling up their vet angry about an email, fax, etc. miscommunication. It's your pet's doctor and they have their best interests at heart; I would never dream of being anything but polite calling into mine, even if I was frustrated.

We are owned by Mars, as is VCA and Blue Pearl, but we are all independent companies that do not work \"together\". I believe if Petsmart still holds any shares in Banfield, it's relatively minimal and we don't answer to them about anything, other than their hours affecting ours (espcially with this pandemic). \n\nRecords are not shared internally between these three practices, so if one of our clients goes to Blue Pearl, for example, they still have to send us a fax saying one of our clients was there and a copy of the notes (although there is also an online portal where we can access the same documents). \n\nTrust me, we hate dealing with Chewy as much as anyone else. They send 3 requests within a single day, claim they \"didn't get the fax\", and call for verbal confirmations before even giving us a full day to get back to them. Our vets get NO benefits to sending people to Chewy vs any other online pharmacy. In fact, we offer price matching to discourage it. And our vets are very open about the fact that Zoetis, Elanco, etc aren't going to warranty their products from them, but they will if they buy from us, regardless of the price.\n\n## Comment ID fqbqnmd with +1 score by [(idtlkpswds, Reddit, 2020-05-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fqbqnmd/) (in reply to ID ggdkrq):\nMy vet even told us to shop the meds.\n\n## Comment ID fqdqwej with +1 score by [(angelheaded--hipster, Reddit, 2020-05-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fqdqwej/) (in reply to ID ggdkrq):\nAs a senior dog rescuer with a bad back, chewy has saved me.

You can't (or others in your household can't) have ordered from Chewy.com before.** \n\nThe $20 off coupon can be used towards pet food, supplies, or pharmacy items as long as your order is $49 or more. (Meaning if your cart is $49 and you use the coupon you would pay $29 total+taxes most likely for the items.) You also get free shipping as a new customer with this coupon.\n\nIt can't be combined with other offers and such. You only get one, \"Welcome to Chewy.com\" promotion code per household. So keep that in mind. **Coupon is good until July 31st, 2023.**\n\nPlease make sure you can actually *use* this coupon code before requesting it. I would prefer that so it doesn't go to waste.\n\nI will message the code to someone if there is any interest.

It did however say limit one coupon but I just assumed it meant one coupon per order. Nope. According to chewy it meant one coupon EVER. So even if it has a different coupon code, and both were sent to me, I couldn’t use the $20 off because I had already used a similar coupon, before.

You may ask about that as well.\n\n### Comment ID k2ggkf2 with +2 score by [(florals_and_stripes, Reddit, 2023-09-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/16t4ouf/why_do_vets_push_their_own_pharmacies_vs_chewy/k2ggkf2/) (in reply to ID k2d1il7):\nThis article is not from a reputable source and was last reviewed in 2018.\n\n#### Comment ID k2gi137 with +2 score by [(slinkystumpy, Reddit, 2023-09-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/16t4ouf/why_do_vets_push_their_own_pharmacies_vs_chewy/k2gi137/) (in reply to ID k2ggkf2):\nSure. Doesn’t mean the info doesn’t still stand. Our regional medical director has asked us to stop using Chewy because they are now compounding medications and sourcing their ingredients from non-FDA registered companies. This is enough for me to not trust them with my own pets medications. Curious what your veterinary background is.\n\n## Comment ID k2d991o with +18 score by [(daabilge, Reddit, 2023-09-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/16t4ouf/why_do_vets_push_their_own_pharmacies_vs_chewy/k2d991o/) (in reply to ID 16t4ouf):\nI guess in addition to the points the others have raised about the product, it's seriously a pain in the butt. They can do the Amazon thing and undercut us since they have higher stock and they move it quickly, although its sometimes lovely to have additional options (like I can still get clients who are averse to using isoxazolines to get a different preventative) and they did reduce our time spent stocking and the space taken up for prevention/diet options and the waste to inventory expiration.\n\nBut Chewy works for us about 70% of the time. It's typically my go-to online pharmacy for pet meds that we don't stock, but they're also quick to throw us under the bus if there's a delay in approval. Usually it's not even our fault - there's a clinic with the exact same name as us in wisconsin where a lot of our scripts get sent (and we get many of theirs) but that doesn't stop us from getting angry calls from clients about it because the chewy rep said it's an issue on our end.. and without fail it's usually our CSRs and techs that end up on the receiving end trying to troubleshoot. They still get abuse from \"well why do you need to examine for a prescription\" and all that, just not that particular \"why hasn't this been approved\" abuse.. So using our in-house pharmacy is a revenue stream for us but also (kind of) reduces the abuse that our CSRs take and cuts down on our approval headache.\n\nIt's worse for some other online pharmacies - petsmart pharmacy refuses to play well with our system at all so we have to write and issue a new paper script for each refill request. Our worst offender is Walmart - they won't accept our faxes and we can't phone prescriptions in without a prescriber ID like they have on the human side, so we have to manually deliver the script to the pharmacy.. and then they call anyway for approval?\n\nBut yeah, sorting through online approvals end up being a lot of extra work for us sometimes.\n\n### Comment ID k2ej6sz with +7 score by [(littlehamsterz, Reddit, 2023-09-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/16t4ouf/why_do_vets_push_their_own_pharmacies_vs_chewy/k2ej6sz/) (in reply to ID k2d991o):\nI really don't understand why vet offices even bother.

You have no idea how the product is stored and whether properly stored ~~and unable to know if they got it directly from the manufacturer.~~ This leads to possibilities of ~~counterfeit or~~ ineffective products.\n\nYour vet obtains product direct from the distributor or manufacturer and is therefore able to guarantee the product to work as intended without any questionable chain of transfer. Therefore, the company will always stand by the product and if your dog somehow got heartworms anyway (which can happen especially with heartgard resistance developing and emerging) there is some coverage of the treatment cost.\n\nSo is $25 worth the question mark to you? It's not to me.\n\nSimparica Trio >>> heartgard for the above reason. Newer product without resistance documented this far. All heartworm products are not the same. Heartgard is cheaper but also it's older.\n\n### Comment ID k2d4ld3 with +26 score by [(JJayC, Reddit, 2023-09-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/16t4ouf/why_do_vets_push_their_own_pharmacies_vs_chewy/k2d4ld3/) (in reply to ID k2d16ml):\nChewy sources their medications directly from manufacturers or manufacturer approved vendors. You can contact the manufacturers, and they'll verify it. They also stand behind any product guarantees and even honor rebates as long as they're not in clinic (instant) rebates.\n\n#### Comment ID k2ehm82 with +8 score by [(littlehamsterz, Reddit, 2023-09-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/16t4ouf/why_do_vets_push_their_own_pharmacies_vs_chewy/k2ehm82/) (in reply to ID k2d4ld3):\n~~Not every product on chewy is guaranteed direct from manufacturer. Some may be and some may not be.~~ (edit apparently they do source directly now so that is good) \n\nI am NOT saying purchasing from an online pharmacy is guaranteed bad or that anyone is bad for using an online pharmacy.  Plain and simple. I am speaking to the fact that you know 100 percent that your vet got it direct from manufacturer and you can literally walk to your vets office and look at the thermostat on the wall and they can even show you shipping dates on their stock. You don't with chewy and you have no idea what temperatures the medications were subjected to in storage and for how long.\n\n\nBack during the height of the pandemic when a lot of pet food companies had NATIONWIDE backorders on many Rx foods such that your vet office literally could not order them for patients that desperately required them, large online pharmacies like Chewy were the ONLY ones that still had supplies of certain foods primarily because they had HUGE back stock of these prescription diets in their warehouses. How long did they have these foods in storage for is uncertain.\n\n#### Comment ID k2duql4 with +5 score by [(florals_and_stripes, Reddit, 2023-09-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/16t4ouf/why_do_vets_push_their_own_pharmacies_vs_chewy/k2duql4/) (in reply to ID k2d4ld3):\nYeah I’m low key concerned that the parent comment hasn’t been flagged or removed for misinformation.

But also within their right to decline when product is purchased from a questionable source. It's probably buried in the T&C\n\nFor me, the resistant strains becoming more prevalent over time is a huge reason I try to steer people away from HG. It only goes up and not down over time due to natural selection . Treating heartworms is not so simple and it is a 12-month process and a lot to put your dog through. $70 is not worth the risk to anyone's dog if they can afford Simparica Trio.\n\nDon't get me wrong - ANY heartworm prevention is better than none but my preference would be a newer product to minimize the chances, especially anyone living in the Mississippi River Delta where the resistance seems to be emerging from.\n\n#### Comment ID k2d2cad with +2 score by [(KittyOnALeash, Reddit, 2023-09-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/16t4ouf/why_do_vets_push_their_own_pharmacies_vs_chewy/k2d2cad/) (in reply to ID k2d1o7a):\nI believe the company will pay for it I ly if your pup is on Heartgard year round and you purchased it through your vet\n\n### Comment ID k2d8vjx with +8 score by [(Parody101, Reddit, 2023-09-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/16t4ouf/why_do_vets_push_their_own_pharmacies_vs_chewy/k2d8vjx/) (in reply to ID k2d16ml):\nUnfortunately, the companies are selling directly to Chewy.

On storage and storage time. That is the questionable part that always concerns me.\n\nI'm sure you remember the height of the pandemic with Rx foods and how sometimes Chewy was the only place you could get certain prescription diets because of the huge back stock Chewy had in their warehouses. They have the space for that, which benefitted some of my patients who desperately needed a specific food. It took Chewy so much longer to run out of these Rx diets that were on nationwide backorder.\n\n### Comment ID k2d254p with +2 score by [(fluorescentstoplight, Reddit, 2023-09-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/16t4ouf/why_do_vets_push_their_own_pharmacies_vs_chewy/k2d254p/) (in reply to ID k2d16ml):\nI believe my question about the HG compensation was answered by another commenter.

He let me ramble and cry as we worked through the cancellation. The next day a bouquet of flowers arrived at our door care of a local florist from Chewy. I can never express just how much that meant to me in those days after our loss. Thank you, Chewy, for your terrific service but also for your extraordinary kindness.\n\nKimberly, Molly’s momma.",

Anytime I’ve ever ordered food, it has never taken it more than 2 days to get to me. They will make anything right that isn’t (not that anything is ever wrong). The very first time I ever ordered food from them, the package was delivered to my neighbors house, who denied having it of course, Chewy replaced that order and I got it the next day!

This week, once again, I received a card with a $20 off code and attempted to use it on a $136 order of cat treats, cat food, dog food, and a collar but it would NOT work. My husband suggested that I call Chewy and address the issue. When I spoke with their representative, no explanation was given as to why I have received multiple cards that do not work, she simply said that she’d “check into it”. She gave me $15 off my current order which she applied from her end. What happened to the advertised $20 off??? This smacks of false advertisement. If this is how Chewy conducts business, I can shop at my local pet store PetCo, who regularly send me discounts through their customer loyalty program.",

I would really be happy if they changed that because then I could save money on auto ship too!!!",

I set the date to be shipped and one month they tried taking the money 4 days in advance. I’m sorry but I don’t have unlimited funds and only get paid once a month. I then changed my delivery date and then they didn’t take the money out until after my shipping date and my order arrived late. It’s just not worth the frustration and headaches to use the auto ship unless you have a lot of money. I will no longer be using the auto ship and pay the difference.",

There is no automated message when you call. Of the dozens of times I’ve called, a human in America has answered by the second ring. They’re friendly and always ask about my cats by name. A few times I’ve had to tell them about one who had passed away, a few days later I get a hand written sympathy card from them. \nOrdering prescription food and medicine is a breeze. You place the order online, they call the vet for authorization, and they always ship immediately. \nThey have a service where you can have a 20 minute virtual vet visit for 20.00. I’ve used it many times. I’ve used it after having an in-person visit and then think of more questions afterward, doesn’t that always happen? I’ve been able to send them pictures, X-rays and bloodwork results. They read them for me and help me understand whatever I didn’t understand at the office. These vets are great and always finish up by sending a summary of the visit and their recommendations. And they send relative articles for your information. I’ve tried the free nurse line through my pet insurance, all they do is tell you to go to the vet. Chewy’s vets actually help you avoid an office visit and will only send you if they know it’s necessary. \nThank you for everything, Chewy!! 😻",

I have never seen a company actually care about anything other than themselves. Chewy cares about your animals needs, and all the others that might not have found a home yet.

          "content": "This is my favorite website with which to do business. They are amazing with their customers. We got our new kitten a little less than 1.5 years ago and we weren’t sure what she was going to end up eating at first. As soon as we brought her home, we ordered the same wet & dry food that her breeder had been feeding her. As she started displaying various neurological symptoms, she began eating less and struggling to chew food. We became worried about giving her any wet food that wasn’t the consistency of baby food because she was starting to cough when she was eating. At about 6 months old, her vet sedated her to make sure there was nothing in the way of her throat. While at her visit, the vet fed her a Rx diet food that she absolutely loved by comparison to the wet food we were giving her. By switching to the prescription wet food exclusively, she started putting on weight again…even though she remained very small. Chewy helped us make the switch by running it through her vet’s office for the authorization of the Rx food. Then, they refunded us for the remaining wet and dry food that she’d stopped eating. This site even recommended that we donate the remaining food we had to a locate shelter or humane society (after they’d refunded us in full for the cost of this food). The people who answered the phone really showed us how much they cared about not just our little one, but about encouraging their customers to donate the refunded food to help local animal populations when other companies would have insisted the food be shipped back to them, even if they only ended up throwing it out or destroying it. \nI trust them with all of our purchases for kitty, Sadie. They free us up to focus on giving her whatever diet best supports her health. This has been so helpful as we’ve adjusted to her changing needs. They even sent us a card and a toy after hearing about Sadie’s difficulties! It’s rare to find a company that legitimately cares for their customers. \nI love this company and I’ll remain a customer forever. \nThanks to Chewy and all the representatives who work for them by answer the phone. This company behaves in such a refreshingly empathic way. I recommend them to everyone I ever talk to about their pets. \n\nJen, Ephraim & Sadie",

Mistakes happen, orders come late or sometimes are wrong but I have no problem calling Chewy customer support because I know the problem will be resolved immediately and they will always go the the extra mile to make sure their customers are completely satisfied, happy and never have to spend time on the phone with someone who is rude and reads from a binder refusing to help.  Amazon customer service could learn what true customer service is.  \nOn a personal note.  Earlier this year, my dog “Bo” was senselessly attacked and stabbed as a result.  His emergency vet bills were extremely expensive and I needed to cancel my Chewy Auto Ship.  It wasn’t caught in time and part of the order already was in transit.  The customer service team told me not to worry and just keep the item in transit.  I couldn’t believe the kindness and generosity of Chewy.  Thankfully my dog Bo recovered but it was a horrific experience.  \nA few days after the incident, a package arrived from Chewy in the mail.  It was a Beautiful Get Well gift and Card for my dog Bo.  It had a lovely handwritten note and was personally signed by the customer care team.  Me and my family were and still are so grateful and deeply touched by such a wonderful gesture from a large corporation.\n\nI hope the Corporate realizes how lucky they are to have such wonderful people who make an impact in a world where people like me have a lot of choices where we spend our money.  Since this incident, I recommend Chewy to everyone!  I work in animal rescue and constantly brag about your amazing people.  I know I am just one person but I would rather pay higher prices and have better service than deal with awful service, like Amazon for example.\nThank you",

When I’m trying to apply search filters, it applies them until a certain point, then randomly clears them all and I have to start all over to try to find what I’m looking for. It’s happened about 6 times in the last hour, so I’ll be trying to use the website instead. It also glitched and the app crashed entirely and restarted at one point.

I used the chat in app to request a return which was answered almost immediately and was super easy to use. The woman who helped me (Kandace C.) was so nice and said that there was no need to ship anything back and to donate my extra food to a local shelter 🥹. I thought this was so cool and thoughtful and solidified my love for chewy. They are a really cool company and buying food on here is way easier and cheaper than in store and with auto ship it comes right when she is running low so there is no stress of having to make time to pick up more food. I could not recommend chewy enough. Truly a great company I will be using them for life!",

Whenever you are browsing items and select one, once you go back to your search results, they’re gone and you have to do the search all over again. This happens when you click through their preset categories to browse too, every time you go in/out of an item it takes you back too far. Please fix this!

My doggy HATED his food. 🤣 He barely tolerated the kibble that his shelter sent me home with. And he loved TikiDog wet food. But he wouldn’t touch the Tikidog dry lamb. I let Chewy know and they refunded me. I assumed they were then going to ask me to drop off the refunded product somewhere but instead they said to donate it to a shelter. So I did. Their chat service is very helpful. I even messaged them at midnight once because I kept forgetting to during the day and their response is fast. \n\nI’ve only had one order mess up in the 7 months I’ve been a customer. They had forgotten 2 items in my last auto ship. They apologized and overnighted the remaining items. Simba and I customers for life! 🥰",

However, whenever you click on the link for lickable treats, it takes you to the section for “soft and chewy treats”. It’s almost like the lickable treat section wasn’t supposed to go live yet or something. I just wanted to bring it to the developers attention and hopefully get it resolved so my dog and I can make our next purchase!!",

The company forces you to “engage” with customers, even though most just want a friendly call and not a person over-stepping boundaries with unrelated questions. The company uses an AI to listen to calls which ranks your empathy, rapport, ownership, personalization, and professionalism. It being AI is the issue. We are not given a script to say to customers but we are expected to meet percentage criteria based off of the things the AI looks for. There are keywords that the AI looks for but the fact that you could lose your job if an AI claims you are “not empathetic enough” is absolutely insane. On top of this, restroom breaks and pretty much anything that might come up in your house while you are working is based off a “not ready” time that must be under a certain percentage. This is understandable if it wasn’t for the fact that Not Ready time included required daily meetings, manager meetings, and work related time off calls like writing notes or doing required quizzes for brand trainings. On top of all of that, the percentage you must meet for this is lowered every quarter so even if you meet the insane goals the company sets, it will eventually fall more. They also have a bunch of other things like “recommending” Chewy services to customers who don’t ask about them, but yet they stress we’re not sales people. Additionally, they do not accommodate to students or anyone who doesn’t have a disability. \n\n\nOverall, it is an extremely stressful job and the company continues to show that they see their employees as numbers rather than actual people. With the bar for rates to be met being raised often and no room for restroom breaks or even time between calls just to breathe, I would not recommend this job to anybody with any form of anxiety.",

But then again, I guess that's your goal, so you can replace us with your countrymen.

We recently even had a family day event where we got to take the workday off fully paid to go and have fun at an indoor race track and arcades place with our families.

The new department is not doing well (Chewy Vetcare) and as a result they have been terminating people left and right while they try to get their ducks in a row. My advice-- Get Mita out of as president of Chewy Healthcare as she has ZERO knowledge on how to successfully run and manage a veterinary business. It's very political as she is the wife of the CEO, Sumit, so change will not happen because she is protected. Also, she modeled all of the hospitals to have a very 'salon' and 'upscale' appearance. It's a hospital-not a spa, the functionality of the space is laughable if you have experience in practice management at other more established companies. I'll be watching the company closely to see how they perform long term. Meanwhile, I am happy to no longer be with such a toxic company. The toxicity is unreal. ",

          "cons": "Salaries are not competitive. The organizational structure does not make sense. There are a lot of \"dotted lines\" where you report to someone who does not oversee your work which lends itself to hearsay. No career development. \"Kick-the-ball\" culture: seasoned Chewtopians will defer projects and assignments to new talent and contractors, give them little-to-no training, and then deflect blame on the new person or contractor for any mishaps or delays to save face. No mentoring. No shadowing. Nepotism, bureaucracy, and cliques - if you aren't part of one, you will be sacrificed. Also, a lot of Chewtopians are Amazonians. There is a wave of Amazonians becoming Chewtopians at the Director or above level, which means middle management gets passed over. People feel the need to look out for themselves and \"CYA\" at the lower levels expense. So if you do not have a good working relationship with your manager or the person who oversees your work, good luck! Some people get flooded with work and it's sink or swim, meanwhile, there are others and you don't know what they do. If you are new, you are subject to midyear reviews (even if you haven't worked 6 months) and even if you are outperforming your team members, you will receive a 5 or lower rating, irrespective of performance.\n\nThe more I spoke to people in the company and community, I realized that there was no employee retention. One 40-person department has lost 20 people since 2023 (within 1 year) not including contractors. A personal friend worked in accounting and left around 6 months. Another black female vet left VetCare because she felt she was treated poorly.\n\nThere are disparities in employee treatment based on race. There needs to be diversity training. Just because there's diversity doesn't mean there aren't disparities in handling employees in different race classes. \n\nChewy is the personification of all that glitter is not gold. It looks great from the outside, but inside is a very dysfunctional \"family\" with toxic family members at the dinner table. Within the first 2 weeks, my coworkers were telling me about all the people who \"left\" and they were laughing about it and demonizing the people that \"left\". It's like Survivor - that was my first red flag.",

My advice-- Get Mita out of as president of Chewy Healthcare as she has ZERO knowledge on how to successfully run and manage a veterinary business. It's very political as she is the wife of the CEO, Sumit, so change will not happen because she is protected. Also, she modeled all of the hospitals to have a very 'salon' and 'upscale' appearance. It's a hospital-not a spa, the functionality of the space is laughable if you have experience in practice management at other more established companies. I'll be watching the company closely to see how they perform long term. Meanwhile, I am happy to no longer be with such a toxic company. The toxicity is unreal. ",

There are a lot of \"dotted lines\" where you report to someone who does not oversee your work which lends itself to hearsay.

No mentoring. No shadowing. Nepotism, bureaucracy, and cliques - if you aren't part of one, you will be sacrificed. Also, a lot of Chewtopians are Amazonians. There is a wave of Amazonians becoming Chewtopians at the Director or above level, which means middle management gets passed over. People feel the need to look out for themselves and \"CYA\" at the lower levels expense. So if you do not have a good working relationship with your manager or the person who oversees your work, good luck! Some people get flooded with work and it's sink or swim, meanwhile, there are others and you don't know what they do. If you are new, you are subject to midyear reviews (even if you haven't worked 6 months) and even if you are outperforming your team members, you will receive a 5 or lower rating, irrespective of performance.\n\nThe more I spoke to people in the company and community, I realized that there was no employee retention. One 40-person department has lost 20 people since 2023 (within 1 year) not including contractors. A personal friend worked in accounting and left around 6 months. Another black female vet left VetCare because she felt she was treated poorly.\n\nThere are disparities in employee treatment based on race. There needs to be diversity training. Just because there's diversity doesn't mean there aren't disparities in handling employees in different race classes. \n\nChewy is the personification of all that glitter is not gold. It looks great from the outside, but inside is a very dysfunctional \"family\" with toxic family members at the dinner table.

They need to realize that some calls are extremely stressful and that representatives need more lenient time or options in between calls to breathe or even just use the restroom. They also need to open their eyes and see that all the required criteria for calls are extremely unnecessary and hinder the customer experience considering not everybody wants to be bothered about their pet names or how their day went. ",
        "cons": "The company micromanages EVERYTHING, from your restroom breaks, time taking notes, and even words used on the actual calls. The company forces you to “engage” with customers, even though most just want a friendly call and not a person over-stepping boundaries with unrelated questions. The company uses an AI to listen to calls which ranks your empathy, rapport, ownership, personalization, and professionalism. It being AI is the issue. We are not given a script to say to customers but we are expected to meet percentage criteria based off of the things the AI looks for. There are keywords that the AI looks for but the fact that you could lose your job if an AI claims you are “not empathetic enough” is absolutely insane. On top of this, restroom breaks and pretty much anything that might come up in your house while you are working is based off a “not ready” time that must be under a certain percentage. This is understandable if it wasn’t for the fact that Not Ready time included required daily meetings, manager meetings, and work related time off calls like writing notes or doing required quizzes for brand trainings. On top of all of that, the percentage you must meet for this is lowered every quarter so even if you meet the insane goals the company sets, it will eventually fall more. They also have a bunch of other things like “recommending” Chewy services to customers who don’t ask about them, but yet they stress we’re not sales people. Additionally, they do not accommodate to students or anyone who doesn’t have a disability. \n\n\nOverall, it is an extremely stressful job and the company continues to show that they see their employees as numbers rather than actual people. With the bar for rates to be met being raised often and no room for restroom breaks or even time between calls just to breathe, I would not recommend this job to anybody with any form of anxiety.",
        "lengthOfEmployment": 4,
        "pros": "It is generally an easy job, you pretty much just take calls and most customers are looking to place orders or get returns. Call flow is usually back-to-back but never too stressful. Additionally, we are allowed to hang up on hostile customers (with warning*) and we are able to transfer to managers if the customers get too frustrated so its overall pretty relaxed when it comes to the actual calls. The company also hires internally often for different positions and makes it extremely easy to apply through an employee portal. They also have diverse slack channels for people in the company looking to connect about non-related things like a book club, video game club, LGBT club, and other diverse things",

      "# [Chewy Q2 earnings results show app use growing as net sales increase 2.6% by Kevin Williams, Mary Meisenzahl, Bloomberg News on 2024-09-03](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/chewy-quarterly-sales/)\nPet product retailer Chewy Inc. saw earnings bark past expectations in Q2. The company reported a 2.6% rise in net sales of $2.86 billion for the period. It also saw its net sales per active customer rise 6% from last year, the company reported.\n\n“Chewy’s compelling value proposition is driving broader and deeper customer engagement, as reflected by our 20 million active customers, which grew sequentially in the quarter, and net sales per active customer of $565, which reached a new record for the company,” said Chewy CEO Sumit Singh in the earnings announcement.\n\nChewy is No. 12 in the Top 1000, which is Digital Commerce 360’s database ranking North America’s largest online retailers by their annual web sales. In the Top 1000, Digital Commerce 360 categorizes Chewy as a Specialty retailer. Digital Commerce 360 projects that Chewy online sales will reach $11.59 billion in 2024.\n\nChewy web sales by year\n\nChewy Q2 earnings highlights\n\n“We delivered top-line growth at the high end of our guidance range, continued significant adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, and compelling free cash flow generation,” Singh noted.\n\nOther takeaways from Chewy’s Q2 earnings release include:\n\nNet income: $299.1 million (up from $280.2 million in Q2 2023)\n\nAdjusted EBITDA: $144.8 million. That’s a $56.7 million increase year over year.\n\nAdjusted net income: $104.8 million, an increase of $40.2 million year over year\n\nIn addition, Chewy’s profit margin was up 11% (up from 0.7% in Q2 2023). The increase in margin was primarily driven by lower expenses, company leaders said.\n\nChewy Vet Care grows\n\nChewy has expanded its brand into animal care by opening Chewy Vet Clinics across the country. Two more clinics — one in Denver, the other in South Florida — opened during Q2. There are six Chewy Vet Clinics open now with plans for a couple more by year’s end. Singh described the synergy between the clinics and Chewy products.\n\n“The leading indicators are promising,” he said during the company’s earnings call. “First, Chewy Vet Care is serving as an acquisition funnel, with the proportion of net new customers acquired through our clinics exceeding our expectation.”\n\nHe said he believes that success is leading to stronger customer relationships.\n\n“Many customers are deepening their commitment to the Chewy ecosystem by purchasing pharmacy or food for the first time,” he added.\n\nChewy’s app use rises\n\nChewy customers are increasingly using the company’s app to drive sales, Singh said.\n\n“Unique customers who placed orders through our app increased by approximately 13% year over year, with overall mobile app orders increasing approximately 15% year over year,” Singh said.\n\nHe noted that Chewy observed both higher units per order and better retention when customers download and use the Chewy app. The app counts 20 million active customers, he said.\n\nChewy and Bark Inc. Collaborate\n\nNot mentioned in the earnings call was another recent addition from the world of pet supplies retail. Bark Inc. launched a collection of its best-selling toys on Chewy, marking the first time Chewy will carry Bark products. The initial launch includes popular items like Grey Bear Hugger and Steve Squeaky Plush Snake. The company plans to expand its offerings on Chewy in the coming months, including toys, consumables, and its dental line, Bark Bright.\n\nBark is No. 204 in the Top 1000.\n\nPercentage changes may not align exactly with dollar figures due to rounding.

      "# [Chewy (company) by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2016-08-12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewy_(company))\nInternet retailer of pet items\n\nThis article is about the pet food retailer. For other uses, see Chewy.\n\nChewy, Inc. is an American online retailer of pet food and other pet-related products based in Plantation, Florida. Chewy went public in 2019 with the ticker symbol CHWY on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\n2011–2019: Founding, acquisition and pre-IPO\n\n[edit]\n\nChewy was founded under the name \"Mr. Chewy\" in June 2011 by Ryan Cohen[3] and Michael Day.[4] In March 2012, the company estimated a total yearly revenue of $26 million, despite losing money in its first half year.[4][5] By 2017, the company had revenue of approximately $2 billion and 51% of online pet food sales in the US.[6][7] At that time, CEO Ryan Cohen prepared to take Chewy public as both Petco and PetSmart approached with merger offers.[8] Petco's offer would be paid for in part using stock, whereas PetSmart offered an all-cash bid that would also allow Chewy to remain a completely separate business.[9] In 2017, Chewy was purchased by PetSmart, a retail entity backed by private equity firm BC Partners,[10] for $3.35 billion, which at the time was the largest ever acquisition of an e-commerce business.[9]\n\nFollowing the acquisition, Cohen remained CEO and operated the business largely as an independent unit of PetSmart.[11] Between 2017 and 2018, Chewy’s sales increased from $2.1 billion to $3.5 billion,[12] with 66% of sales coming from customers signed up for automatic recurring shipments.[9] Sumit Singh succeeded Ryan Cohen as CEO of Chewy in March 2018.[13]\n\n2019–present: Post-IPO\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2019, Chewy filed an S-1 for an initial public offering, intending to trade under the ticker symbol CHWY. In its filing, Chewy reported a net loss of $268 million on total sales of $3.5 billion for its 2018 fiscal year.[14] In the 2019 fiscal year, Chewy earned net sales of $4.85 billion, a 40 percent year-over-year increase on a 52-week basis. The company saw increased demand from millions of existing and new customers as the business sustained growth throughout the economic disruption of the COVID-19 era.[15][16]\n\nChewy launched a free tele-triage service called Connect With a Vet in October 2020.[17] In November 2020, Chewy announced that it would produce and fulfill orders of customized prescription medications, commonly referred to as compounding, for instances where commercial alternatives are absent.[18] In 2020, it was announced that Chewy and PetSmart would split to operate as separate companies.[19]\n\nIn March 2021, Chewy reported revenue of $2.04 billion for Q4 of 2020, making it Chewy's first quarter of net profitability, and net sales of $7.15 billion for the fiscal year.[20][21] In March 2022, Chewy reported net sales of $8.89 billion for the 2021 fiscal year.[22]\n\nIn August 2022, Chewy announced the introduction of the CarePlus program, which provides pet insurance and wellness plans. This initiative marked Chewy's entry into the health insurance sector for pets.[23]\n\nIn the 2022 fiscal year, Chewy's net sales grew 13.6% since 2021, to $10.1 billion.[24] Following this, in December 2023, Chewy expanded its healthcare services by launching Chewy Vet Care. This service includes the establishment of veterinary practices that offer routine check-ups, urgent care, and surgical procedures.[25]\n\nIn fiscal year 2023, Chewy reported net sales of $11.15 billion representing 10.2% year-over-year growth primarily driven by increased spending from both new and existing customers, strength of Chewy's Autoship subscription program and growth of Chewy's pet healthcare business.[26]\n\nCorporate affairs\n\n[edit]\n\nThe company's founder and first CEO, Ryan Cohen, stated that he used Jeff Bezos's 1997 letter to shareholders as a roadmap for how to grow Chewy by using Amazon's guidelines on the convenience of shopping online and customer service.[27] Cohen stepped down in March 2018,[28] and Sumit Singh was named the company's CEO in March 2018 after working as its COO since 2017 and previously as an executive at Dell and Amazon.[29][30][31][32] Singh led the company through its IPO; Chewy grew to a market capitalization of $40 billion. The company reported to have employed around 7,000 people in the United States in 2018 and more than 12,000 by 2019.[33][34] The company has more than 18,000 employees in the United States as of 2021.[35] Chewy is chaired by Raymond Svider of BC Partners. The private equity firm continues to own around 80 percent of Chewy following the latter's IPO, representing 98 percent of the voting power.[36]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]",

      "# [Chewy to open veterinary practices in Florida, Colorado on 2023-12-15](https://www.avma.org/news/chewy-open-veterinary-practices-florida-colorado)\nOnline pet supply retailer Chewy announced December 14 it will be opening veterinary clinics in 2024.\n\nThe company is launching a handful of practices under the brand name “Chewy Vet Care,” with the first location to open in South Florida early next year. The clinics will offer services including routine appointments, urgent care, and surgery.\n\nListings on the Chewy Vet Care website show veterinarian, veterinary technician, and veterinary staff positions in Plantation, Florida—where the company is headquartered—and Denver.\n\nThe practices will use Chewy’s online platform that also works with the Chewy Vet Care website or third-party partner practices, according to the press release.\n\n“Expanding into veterinary care is the natural next step in Chewy’s evolution and we are excited to bring our customer-forward thinking to our veterinarians and practice team,” said Mita Malhotra, president of Chewy Health, in the release, adding that the company worked with veterinarians and customers to design the new concept.\n\nChewy.com was the online shop with the highest e-commerce net sales selling pet supplies in the U.S., with a revenue of $10 billion in 2022, according to Statista.\n\nMoving into the veterinary health care space is something for which Chewy, founded in 2011, has already been laying the groundwork. In October 2020, the company launched its medication compounding and telehealth service, “Connect with a Vet.” It allows pet owners to connect with a licensed veterinarian to “get answers to commonly asked questions, receive advice, discuss concerns they might have regarding the health and wellness of their pet, and obtain referrals to their local veterinarians or emergency clinics,” according to its fiscal year 2022 annual report.\n\nIn 2021, it launched Practice Hub, an e-commerce offering for veterinarians that can integrate with practice information management systems (PIMS), which the company says over 1,000 veterinary practices now use. Then in 2022, Chewy launched its pet insurance offering, CarePlus, and acquired Petabyte, a cloud-based services provider for the veterinary sector.\n\n“We provide customers with what we believe is a one-stop shop for their prescription and special diet needs with our over-the-counter and veterinarian diet offerings and Chewy Pharmacy products,” according to the annual report. “In recent years, we have expanded our products and services to advance our mission to be the most trusted resource for pet parents and veterinarians alike, and to make pet healthcare more affordable and accessible to pet parents. We believe that we share a common goal of pet health and wellness with the veterinarian community, and we will continue to utilize our strengths to enhance partnerships with customers and veterinarians alike.”\n\nAt the same time, Chewy has previously lobbied, and received pushback from veterinarians, for federal legislation that would require a veterinarian to provide a client with a written prescription for a companion animal’s medication, whether the client requests it or not.\n\n“If the number of veterinarians who refuse to authorize prescriptions to our pharmacy staff increases, or if veterinarians are successful in discouraging pet owners from purchasing from us, our sales could decrease and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected,” the report states.\n\nThe company acknowledged in the same report that “We compete directly and indirectly with veterinarians for the sale of pet medications and other health products. Veterinarians hold a competitive advantage because many pet owners may find it more convenient or preferable to purchase prescription medications directly from their veterinarians at the time of an office visit.”\n\nA version of this story appears in the February 2024 print issue of JAVMA",

Gill also mocked up his own version of the standard SEC 13G filing form by adding a section stating he was “not a cat.”\n\nGill shot to fame in 2020 after becoming the de facto leader of an online-populist movement to purchase stocks of legacy brick-and-mortar companies like GameStop, AMC and Bed Bath and Beyond, with the stated goal of attempting to turn the companies around. It didn’t quite work — although the movement did successfully create losses for investors who were actively betting against the companies.\n\nBut his trading has also been the subject of scrutiny.\n\nGill now faces a new class-action lawsuit filed in Brooklyn alleging that his most recent trades in GameStop shares amounted to a \"pump and dump\" scheme.\n\nThe plaintiff, Martin Radev, a Nevada resident, representing a class of other GameStop investors, alleges Gill knowingly used his large and influential platform to \"pump\" up the stock price of the company this year by posting online while failing to reveal he had taken up a new position in the company. Gill then successfully sold his shares for a profit, the lawsuit alleges.\n\nThe price of GameStop shares remains higher than before Gill's post but has declined from its peak by about 50%.\n\nThey were down 5% in Monday trading.\n\nIn a twist, GameStop is now run by Ryan Cohen, who also co-founded Chewy. Cohen helped fuel the meme-stock wave after revealing he had taken a large position in GameStop in 2020, several months after Gill first began posting about his position.\n\nCohen is no longer affiliated with Chewy management, and it is not clear whether he and Gill have any relationship. An attorney for Cohen did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe secretary of state of Massachusetts, where Gill resides, is also investigating the GameStop trade.\n\nGill did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "# [Has there ever been a better way of ending the day? Crispy, chewy Ovaltine cookies taste great by Monika Spykerman on 2024-09-25](https://www.columbian.com/news/2024/sep/25/has-there-ever-been-a-better-way-of-ending-the-day-crispy-chewy-ovaltine-cookies-taste-great/)\nOne thing I really enjoyed about our recent trip to England was the variety of fun things to drink, like Ribena blackcurrant syrup and sparkling elderflower flavored water. What really got my taste buds going were hot drink powders like Barleycup, Horlick’s and Ovaltine.\n\nI became particularly obsessed with Barleycup, made from barley, rye and chicory. I’ve been trying to cut back on coffee. (Full disclosure: I am drinking coffee as I write this, so that’s how it’s going.)\n\nI’ve been on the hunt for hot beverages that have a similar flavor profile to coffee but contain little or no caffeine. Here in my mid-50s, caffeine makes my hands shake so badly that I can barely drink my 12th cup of coffee.\n\nEngland was mostly cool and misty (shocking, I know) so I was already in an autumnal frame of mind when we returned home. Everyone knows that autumn means cookies. (FYI: Summer, winter and spring also mean cookies.)\n\nI was searching around for cookie recipes when I had a “Eureka!” moment. Why not mix some of that yummy drink powder right into the dough?\n\nAh, but I am not the first person to think of this. Many recipes for cookies use not only Ovaltine but also Barleycup, Horlicks and chicory powder, made from the roasted roots of the chicory flower and a popular coffee additive in New Orleans. (Think Café du Monde and beignets.)\n\nObviously these things are difficult to find in the Pacific Northwest, where we just add more coffee to our coffee. But one thing every grocery store has is Ovaltine, either the original malt flavor (with no cocoa), the chocolate malt (with malt and cocoa) or the rich chocolate flavor (which contains no malt).\n\nBefore I delved into the recipe, I wanted to learn more. Who were the first people to make a hot beverage out of powdered grain?\n\nIn 1869, British brothers James and William Horlick created a powder of malted barley, milk powder and wheat flour as a nutritional supplement for babies and convalescing adults. (Malt, in case you’re wondering, consists of toasted sprouted grains, giving them caramel-like flavor.)\n\nHorlick’s was regularly prescribed by doctors and dentists of the day and soldiers also received rations of Horlicks to bolster their health during military operations.\n\nOvaltine wasn’t developed until half a century later, when Swiss chemist Alber Wander created Ovomaltine from powdered malt, milk, eggs and cocoa. It was conceived as a healthful drink on the premise that barley malt contains many vitamins.\n\nIt was exported to England in 1909 under the name Ovaltine, then it came to the U.S., Canada, Australia and Southeast Asia. It’s still quite a popular drink in India.\n\nTo this day, there’s an Ovaltine factory near Bern, Switzerland (though it’s also made in several other countries).\n\nThe formula has changed in the last 100 years and different variations are sold in different countries. British Ovaltine, for example, no longer contains eggs.\n\nOvaltine and other beverage powders have been used by home cooks to enrich baked goods for a hundred years. Now I’m joining that noble procession with my own recipe for chocolate chip Ovaltine cookies.\n\nThe recipe uses 1/2 cup Ovaltine, so that malt flavor really comes through. You can also add nuts or crushed chocolate-covered malt balls instead of, or in addition to, chocolate chips. The texture is part of what makes these cookies so delicious because they bake up crispy around the edges but chewy in the middle. It’s the best of both cookie worlds.\n\nFirst, melt a stick of butter (1/2 cup) and set it aside to cool slightly. Sift 1 ½ cups flour, 1/2 cup Ovaltine — any variety, I used chocolate malt — and ½ teaspoon baking soda into a big bowl.\n\nWhisk in 1/2 cup packed brown sugar. Make a well in the middle, pour in the melted butter, one beaten egg and 2 tablespoons of milk.\n\nFold in ½ cup chocolate chips, nuts or crushed chocolate-covered malt balls or a combination of all three.\n\nLeave the dough to sit while heating the oven to 350 degrees. Pour ¹/3 cup of sugar into a bowl. (In honor of fall, I couldn’t help but add a teaspoon of pumpkin spice to the sugar. You may be able to show more restraint.)\n\nScoop tablespoon-sized chunks out of the dough, roll into balls and coat thoroughly with sugar. Flatten slightly and place on cookie sheet with room in between, because these cookies spread while baking. Bake for 15 minutes or until golden brown and crackled on top (or bake for 12 minutes for chewier cookies). Let the cookies cool completely on a wire rack.\n\nEat all 30 cookies. Over a period of many days, of course. What else could I mean? Excuse me while I wipe these crumbs off my mouth.\n\nOvaltine Cookies\n\n1½ cups flour\n\n1/2 cup any variety Ovaltine (or other malted drink powder)\n\n1/2 cup packed brown sugar\n\n½ teaspoon baking soda\n\n½ cup butter, melted\n\n1 large egg, beaten\n\n1 teaspoon vanilla\n\n2 tablespoons milk\n\n½ cup chocolate chips, pecans or walnuts (or ¼ cup chips and ¼ cup nuts)\n\n1/3 cup sugar for rolling\n\nMelt the butter and set it aside. Sift the flour, Ovaltine and baking soda into a big bowl. Whisk in brown sugar. Make a well in the middle; pour in the melted butter and beaten egg. Stir to combine and then leave the dough to sit while heating the oven to 350 degrees. Pour ½ cup of sugar into a bowl. Scoop tablespoon-sized chunks out of the dough, roll into balls and coat thoroughly with sugar. Flatten slightly and place on cookie sheet spaced well apart because the cookies spread while baking. Bake for 15 minutes or until golden brown and crackled on top. (Bake for 12 minutes for chewier cookies.) Let the cookies cool completely on a wire rack. Makes about 30.",
      "# [Why Your Old Dog Won’t Sleep at Night—and What You Can Do About It by Elizabeth Anderson Lopez on 2015-11-16](https://be.chewy.com/help-my-old-dog-wont-sleep-at-night/)\n“Sleep disruptions can be from a variety of causes, often medical in nature,” Dr. Crosby says. “Causes range from gastrointestinal trouble to urinary system infection to early stages of dementia.” Speak with your veterinarian if your pet is suffering from sleep disruption.\n\nNicholas Dodman, BVMS, MRCVS, DACVB, section head and program director of the Animal Behavior Department of Clinical Sciences at the Cummings Veterinary Medical Center at Tufts University in North Grafton, Massachusetts, distills the potential medical issues further into two categories:\n\nCanine cognitive dysfunction (CCD), also commonly known as canine Alzheimer's or dementia\n\nPain\n\nDementia as a Cause of Dog Insomnia\n\n“Just like people, as dogs get older there is an increasing frequency [of dementia],” Dr. Dodman says.\n\nBecause there’s no test for CCD, diagnosis can be tricky. Essentially, it’s a diagnosis of exclusion when other causes have been ruled out, Dr. Dodman says.\n\nA trip to your veterinarian can help determine the cause of your dog’s insomnia and rule out others. This is often accomplished through performing a physical examination, blood work, and a urinalysis, Dr. Crosby says. After those tests have been completed, your vet may recommend more extensive testing.\n\n“You don’t do a bone scan or MRI willy nilly—only after standard tests have been done,” Dr. Dodman says. Your veterinarian will determine which tests are appropriate for your pet.\n\nSymptoms of canine Alzheimer’s, or senility, that affect sleep include restlessness, disorientation, and confusion. And there may be indicators during the day, too, including house soiling, increased anxiety, reduced appetite, weight loss, and lack of energy.\n\nIf a dog does have CCD, pet parents can help improve their dog’s quality of life with diet, medication, supplements, and cognitive enrichments. Unfortunately, there is no cure to CCD, which is one of the parallels to human Alzheimer’s.\n\nPain as a Cause of Dog Insomnia\n\nAnother possible reason for why a senior dog is restless at night is arthritis and pain, especially due to cancer in dogs, which Dr. Dodman says is the most common cause of death in older dogs.\n\n“Tumors swell and grow and push things around,” Dr. Dodman explains.\n\nAnd if a dog is in pain, that pain can be worse at night because there are no distractions, Dr. Dodman says.\n\nDogs who cannot sleep at night because of fear and anxiety may display signs like enlarged pupils, whale eye (where the whites of the dog’s eyes are visible), tucked tails, and drooling.\n\nSleeplessness may also be caused by seizures in dogs. “Seizures are not as well suppressed as they are during the day, and are especially common in old dogs,” Dr. Dodman says.\n\nEnvironmental Causes for Dog Insomnia\n\nAny change in an adult dog’s behavior is cause for concern, says Pat Miller, CBCC-KA, CPDT-KA, director of Peaceable Paws Dog and Puppy Training in Fairplay, Maryland, and should be discussed with a veterinarian. But sometimes, instead of a medical cause for dog insomnia, there could be external factors causing the sleeplessness that can be easily resolved.\n\nIf your senior dog is restless at night, consider any external changes that have occurred, including:\n\nChanges in the household routine\n\nNew noises outside that may be disturbing your dog\n\nNew household members\n\nReduction in your dog's daily exercise/activity level\n\nThose new noises may be seasonal. For example, a loud snowplow can affect your canine’s ability to sleep and lead to your old dog pacing at night, says Dr. Dodman. Another dog was disturbed when their house’s heating system kicked in, causing sleep issues, Dr. Dodman also recalls.\n\nDog Sleep Apnea and Dog Nightmares\n\nDog Sleep Apnea\n\nPeople who suffer from sleep apnea may be inclined to think that their older dog with sleep issues has dog sleep apnea. But this may prove not to be the issue.\n\nSleep apnea doesn’t necessarily occur in older dogs, but it does with brachycephalic dogs—that is, dog breeds with flat faces, like Pugs and Shih Tzus—especially if they’re overweight, Dr. Dodman says. Possible signs of sleep apnea in dogs include snoring, suddenly waking up to gasp for air, and daytime fatigue.\n\nDog Nightmares\n\nSomething else that can affect a dog’s sleep at any age is nightmares. Dr. Dodman says electroencephalograms (EEGs) demonstrate brainwave activity increases during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the dreaming phase of sleep.\n\nDogs with the condition REM behavior disorder (RBD) physically act out what’s going on, instead of dreaming quietly, displaying the symptoms you would expect of a nightmare. Behaviors typically seen with REM sleep behavior disorders include sudden leg movements, growling, barking, and biting.",

      "# [As consumers pull back on discretionary spending, Chewy focuses on healthcare by Caroline Jansen on 2024-01-19](https://www.retaildive.com/news/chewy-ceo-sumit-singh-pet-healthcare/704997/)\nNEW YORK — Chewy is leaning on healthcare to fuel future growth.\n\n“Animal health is the next frontier. That much has been clear,” Chewy CEO Sumit Singh said during a Tuesday discussion at the National Retail Federation’s Big Show in New York.\n\nVet health is a $40 billion market-size opportunity, he said, adding that “it’s growing much faster than pet food, supplies or retail.”\n\nLast month, the online pet retailer announced it would open its first veterinary clinic with the launch of Chewy Vet Care. Chewy will open vet practices throughout 2024, offering services like surgery, urgent care and routine appointments. The company is powering its vet clinics through Chewy’s open platform, which can be used for Chewy Vet Care or third-party partner practices.\n\n“Over the next five to seven years, the demand for veterinarians is going to outweigh the relevant supply for veterinarians,” Singh said. “You need a forward-looking, tech-integrated player such as ourselves, who has both the promise on customer experience, as well as tech and product innovation, to be able to bring these two together and say, ‘How do we design solutions that allow us — by the use of technology, use of good retail principles, and service orientation — to bridge these gaps?’”\n\nThe vet practices, Singh said, are intended to alleviate pain points associated with traditional vet visits, like not being able to schedule appointments after hours or on holidays. Chewy also sought to remove the less desirable aspects of traditional vet clinics — like the smell and sterile appearance.\n\n“More than the humans, pets immediately recognize that,” Singh said.\n\nThe Chewy Vet Care clinics follow other healthcare moves from the retailer, like its Connect with a Vet telehealth service and its veterinarian-only marketplace Practice Hub.\n\nThe growing humanization of pets is driving the increased demand for health and wellness offerings, according to Singh. “We would trade our health sometimes for the needs of our pet,” he said.\n\nHealthcare has become a focus area for other pet retailers in recent years. Petco in 2020 announced it was repositioning itself as a health and wellness company, offering better-for-you food choices, rolling out pet hospitals and introducing Vital Care, its paid annual membership program. And PetSmart in 2021 launched an online pharmacy for pet medications.\n\nThe pet category — particularly pet health — remains relatively strong even as consumers pull back on discretionary spending in the face of economic uncertainty.\n\nIn its most recent quarter, Chewy reported third-quarter net sales increased 8.2% year over year to $2.7 billion. However, the retailer swung to a net loss of $35.8 million from a profit of $2.3 million the year prior, while its operating loss was $10.2 million, up from $434,000 in the year-ago quarter. The pet retailer’s active customer base also shrank 1.3% year over year to 20.3 million. The introduction of more health and wellness offerings, like Chewy Vet Care, could offer another entry point for potential customers to enter Chewy’s ecosystem.\n\n“From a caring-for-the-pet point of view, pet parents are still very resilient. They're spending robustly on pet health,” Singh said. “We've remained fairly resilient.”",
      "# [Chewy Claus holiday campaign aims to deliver cheer by dvm360 Staff on 2023-11-21](https://www.dvm360.com/view/chewy-claus-holiday-campaign-aims-to-deliver-cheer)\nChewy Claus will be sending special gifts and other presents to lucky pets that submit their holiday lists. The program is run by pet supply company Chewy, throughout the holiday season until December 15.\n\nChewy debuted its “Letters to Chewy Claus” program in 2022. This program allows pets to ask for treats, toys, a new wheelchair, or a reunion with their favorite person.1\n\nAs letters filter in this year, Chewy Claus read one from pitbull rescue pup, Blue, asking to be reunited with his owner, who is in the military and stationed in another state. Blue is currently being looked after by a family member until his owner, Dan, could come home. Chewy Claus granted Blue’s wish and helped reunite Blue and Dan.1\n\nAll pet species are encouraged to submit their wish by visiting Be.Chewy.com/Chewy-Claus. For every letter submitted to Chewy Claus before December 15, the company will donate 1 pound of food to a nonprofit partner, up to 200,000 pounds. Pets can also choose to defer their holiday gift and send an extra pound of food to pets in need.1\n\n“At Chewy, we pride ourselves on taking the utmost care of pets and pet parents every day, but the holiday season is a special time to do even more,” said Orlena Yeung, VP of brand marketing at Chewy, in an organizational release. “We were thrilled by the enthusiasm and generosity our community demonstrated last year and knew we needed to make the program bigger for more pets to participate. We hope Chewy Claus is a tradition pets and their pet parents look forward to every year as much as we do.”1\n\nLast year, nearly 80,000 letters were submitted to Chewy Claus, resulting in thousands of gift deliveries, and 80,000 pounds of food donated.1 Animal shelters are always in need of food donations, so in addition to donating through Chewy, local shelter websites should be viewed to see how to donate directly.\n\nAccording to a Chewy representative, the pet company also plans to donate up to $1,000,000 to shelters in need which a customer purchase match. For every purchase made through Chewy now until January 3, 2024, Chewy will donate the same amount.\n\nReference"
