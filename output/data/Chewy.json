      "# [15 Things To Know About Keeping Hamsters as Pets by Yvonne Villasenor on 2024-09-25](https://be.chewy.com/hamster/)\nFrom their inquisitive nature and sweet personalities to their cuddly appearance, hamsters make excellent pets. And while they can be lower-maintenance compared to dogs or cats, it’s important to provide proper hamster care for a long, healthy life.\n\nIf you’re considering adopting a hamster as a new pet, read on to learn more about these fun little furballs.\n\n1 There are over 20 recognized species of hamsters.\n\nThat’s a lot of hamsters—and all are members of the Cricetidae family. Unlike dogs and cats, whose differences are due to variations in their breed, the visible differences in types of hamsters are because they’re entirely different species, says Tony Rose Adler, co-president of the California Hamster Association in Los Angeles.\n\nWhile most species of hamsters are wild, there are five domesticated hamster species, which are:\n\nSyrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus): You’ve definitely come across these cuties at the pet store. Syrian hamsters, also called Golden hamsters, are the largest and most commonly kept due to their relatively docile personalities, Adler says.\n\nWinter White Dwarf hamsters (Phodopus sungorus): A small hamster whose coat turns white in winter (hence the name).\n\nCampbell’s Dwarf hamsters (Phodopus campbelli): Also known as Djungarian hamsters and Russian dwarfs, Campbell’s dwarf hamsters are social and active, making them fun pets to watch.\n\nChinese hamsters (Cricetulus griseus or Cricetulus barabensis griseus): These unique hamsters are characterized by their slightly longer tail.\n\nRoborovski Dwarf hamsters (Phodopus roborovskii): This is the fastest and smallest of the hamster species, Adler says, and is therefore less suited to handling.\n\n2 Hamsters are crepuscular.\n\nIt’s a common myth that hamsters are nocturnal, snoozing throughout the day and keeping active on their exercise wheel like a long-distance runner at night. Really, hamsters are crepuscular, meaning they’re awake at dawn and dusk and usually resting during the day and overnight.\n\n3 Wild hamsters and domesticated hamsters have important differences.\n\nAccording to the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), wild hamsters are larger than domesticated hamsters: They can grow up to 14 inches long, while a Syrian hamster can grow to about 7 inches. Additionally, wild hamsters are mostly nocturnal, while pet hamsters are crepuscular.\n\nThere are 15 species of wild hamster living in grasslands, fields, and meadows spanning from western European countries into western Asia. Sadly, the common hamster (Cricetus cricetus) is considered critically endangered.\n\n4 Hamsters have useful—and cute!—cheek pouches.\n\nHave you ever seen a hamster with huge, puffed-out cheeks? They’re able to safely hoard and stuff their faces thanks to their cheek pouches. These cheek pouches are like long cul-de-sacs on the inside of both sides of their mouths, says Courtney Campbell, DVM, DACVS-SA, a small animal specialty surgeon at VetSurg in Ventura, California. They’re essentially invaginations—or long, wide sleeves with a dead end—of the oral mucosa.\n\nDr. Campbell notes that hamsters’ pouches can be used for transporting the following:\n\nFood\n\nBedding\n\nNesting material\n\nTheir young (although this is rare)\n\nAnother fun fact: Hamsters can inflate their cheek pouches to increase buoyancy when they need to swim!\n\nThese pouches extend to the shoulders and are retracted by the cheek muscle, which evolved from their trapezius muscle, Dr. Campbell says. When it’s time to empty their cheek pouches, they simply push the contents forward with their paws. “My hamster, Quaratina, does this every night when she is adjusting her bed,” Dr. Campbell says.\n\n5 A hamster’s front teeth never stop growing.\n\nHamsters’ front teeth, or incisors, continuously grow. This, Adler says, is why hamster-friendly chews are very important to their health. They help keep their front teeth at a healthy length, which helps prevent dental problems and other serious health issues.\n\n6Hamsters prefer to be alone.\n\nThere’s a common misconception that hamsters are social or “need” friends. The truth is, they’d rather be lone wolves—er, hammies.\n\n“All species of hamsters naturally live solitary lives in the wild, and this is the safest choice for them as pets too,” Adler says. “They only need you!”\n\n7They need a habitat with plenty of space.\n\nIf you’re looking for the best habitat for your hammy, Adler suggests looking for a hamster cage that’s secure, large, and provides a basin for deep bedding. In their natural habitat, they burrow and live across territories up to a square mile, she adds.\n\n“While we can’t replicate that in our homes, the recommended minimum cage size for a hamster of any species is 600 square inches,” Adler says. They’ll also need a bar spacing of one-half inch or less to keep them from escaping.\n\nShe says different hamsters do best in different styles of cages:\n\nFor female Syrian hamsters: A tank of 40 gallons or larger, with a screen top and clips, is necessary to keep these notoriously restless hamsters from escaping.\n\nFor Roborovski hamsters: Tanks are also a great option for this species, as their small size makes it easy to escape most other cages.\n\nFor male Syrian hamsters and adult dwarf hamsters: A bar cage, like the Prevue 528 or Ranch cage is great for these types of hamsters. Adler considers these two options to be easy to clean and highly customizable.\n\nPrevue Pet Products Ranch Universal Small Pet House\n\n$99.49\n\nFREE 1-3 day shipping\n\nPrevue Pet Products Deluxe Hamster Home\n\n$91.08\n\nFREE 1-3 day shipping\n\nAivituvin Anti-Chewing Wooden Hamster Cage\n\n$149.99\n\nFREE 1-3 day shipping\n\n8Hamsters are omnivorous and coprophagic.\n\nHamsters eat all kinds of foods, including veggies and meat—and sometimes their own waste. (Yep, that’s what coprophagic means.)\n\nIn the wild, these little omnivores will eat seeds, grains, plants, and some invertebrates. However, domesticated hamsters thrive with pellets supplemented with fruits, vegetables, nuts, and animal protein, and with treats kept to a minimum. Dr. Campbell says it’s important to avoid seed-based diets to prevent obesity and selective feeding. Instead, give commercial pellets to ensure your hammy is getting all the nutrients they need.\n\n9 The right essentials can make a world of difference to your hamster.\n\nAlong with a spacious cage, hamsters need enrichment items in their habitat to keep them happy and healthy. Adler says hamster essentials include:\n\nPaper-based or aspen bedding (for nesting, burrowing, and odor control)\n\nHideouts (for a built-in burrow and a place to nest)\n\nA water bottle or bowl\n\nChews (for healthy teeth)\n\nSand and bowl (for bathing and soaking up excess oils)\n\nHamsters can also benefit from enrichment in the form of treats, an appropriately sized saucer wheel, and bendy bridges.\n\nFrisco Wooden Bridge Small Pet Hideout\n\n$10.17\n\nWare Flying Saucer Small Animal Exercise Wheel\n\n$13.99\n\nNaturals by Rosewood Summer Harvest Small Pet Treats\n\n$7.46\n\nTemporarily out of stock\n\n10 Hamsters can run up to 8 miles a day.\n\nHamsters love to run! So naturally, a proper wheel is important, Adler says.\n\n“The number one tip for pet parents is to ensure the wheel is large enough that their hamster’s back does not arch into a ‘U’ shape while running,” she says. “This indicates the wheel is too small, and running on it will lead to spinal damage, arthritis, and/or obesity if they refuse to run at all.”\n\nWhen looking for a safe, high-quality wheel, she suggests looking for one that’s at least 8 inches wide for dwarf hamsters and at least 12 inches wide for Syrian hamsters. Her recommendation is the Kaytee Comfort Wheel, which comes in both sizes.\n\n11 Syrian hamsters originated nearly 100 years ago.\n\nSyrian hamsters are popular pets. The Syrian hamster (bred in captivity) is said to have originated from a litter of eight hamsters collected near Aleppo, Syria, in 1930, Dr. Campbell says.\n\n12 Hamsters need lots of exercise.\n\nDid you know hamsters’ exercise needs vary across sexes rather than species? “Female hamsters of all species are much more rambunctious and need a plethora of outlets for their energy,” Adler says. “Male hamsters tend to be more relaxed and lazy, but all hamsters still enjoy a good workout on their wheel.”\n\nFor floor time, she recommends using a safe playpen or a bathtub, with the drain plugged and toys added. However, she advises steering clear of hamster balls, despite their popularity.\n\n“Hamsters cannot see very well and rely on their sense of smell to navigate,” she says. “Hamster balls strip them of this ability, which is very stressful. As well, the tiny air slots are perfect for catching little toes and inadvertently breaking ankles.”\n\n13Hamsters generally live up to three years.\n\nThe average lifespan for a hamster can depend on their genetics and husbandry.\n\nDr. Campbell provides a general breakdown on pet rodent lifespans:\n\nHamsters and gerbils: 2–3 years\n\nMice: 1–3 years\n\nRats: 2–4 years\n\nGuinea pigs: 5–7 years\n\nIn rare cases, it’s possible for hamsters to live beyond these estimates. According to Guinness World Records™, the oldest hamster ever was 4.5 years old!\n\n14 Hamsters require different care compared to guinea pigs and gerbils.\n\nWhile hamsters, guinea pigs, and gerbils are all rodents belonging to the Rodentia order, these three animals belong to different families:\n\nHamsters (Cricetidae)\n\nGuinea pigs (Caviidae)\n\nGerbils (Muridae)\n\nThese adorable critters are all considered pocket pets. However, their size as well as their care (e.g., dietary, exercise, and housing) varies from one to another.\n\n15 Hamsters are great pets.\n\n“The most common misconception is that hamsters are not good pets,” Adler says. “Many of the ‘problem’ behaviors associated with hamsters, such as biting and escaping, are actually due to stress and boredom.”\n\nTo prevent behavioral issues, she emphasizes the importance of providing a spacious cage with lots of enrichment.\n\nIt’s always best to research the different hamster species to learn more about their unique characteristics and needs before deciding which is right for you.\n\nThis content was medically reviewed by Chewy vets.\n\nNew Pet",
      "# [What To Do If Your Bird Is Sneezing by Chewy Editorial on 2013-08-06](https://be.chewy.com/sneezing/)\nMost parrots naturally come from tropical, humid climates and when kept indoors as pets the heating and cooling to control indoor climate dries the air. Your bird? nasal passages are then dried, which, in most cases, causes sneezing.\n\nSYMPTOMS\n\nA bird may sneeze for a number of reasons other than it being in an environment that is too dry. Vitamin-A deficiency or a bacterial, fungal or viral infection can also cause sneezing and discharge from your bird? nares. A more serious problem that could cause damage to the nasal or sinus passages could be the case if audible breathing sounds, tail-bobbing, weight loss, nasal or eye discharge or a change in vocalizations or eating habits accompany the sneezing.\n\nIf a bird that is native to Central or South America is housed with or near a dusty bird, such as a cockatoo, cockatiel, African grey or Eclectus, the dander from these birds can cause sneezing in your other birds.\n\nIMMEDIATE CARE\n\nSome sneezing is normal and is likely due to a dry environment. If it becomes a chronic problem or nasal discharge accompanies the sneezing, a full vet check is necessary to determine is the problem is due to some sort of infection.\n\nLONG-TERM CARE\n\nKeep your bird in an adequately humid environment so the cilia in their nasal passages can work properly to clear debris. Provide your bird with a sufficient amount of Vitamin-A, which also helps the nasal passages work properly.\n\nIf the vet tests determine that no disease or infection is the cause for the sneezing, here are several tips for improving your bird? too-dry environment:\n\n1) Take your bird into the bathroom while you shower, enveloping it in high humidity.\n\n2) Have your avian vet show you how to periodically flush your bird? nostrils with sterile saline to remove debris or set up a regular appointment to have your vet perform the saline flushing.\n\n3) Try moving the bird into a room with a humidifier, but always keep the water clean to prevent bacteria from growing\n\n4) Place bird safe plants in your bird? room, which will add oxygen and humidity to its environment.\n\n5) Periodically mist your bird to raise humidity\n\n6) Reduce allergens by running am air filter with HEPA filtration. Run a box fan with an air conditioner filter on the back to catch dust, dander and feathers. This will increase the efficiency of the air filter, which will clean any additional allergens not caught by the fan.\n\nPosted By: Chewy Editorial\n\nFeatured Image: By Ladymoonz/Shutterstock",
      "# [Is Your Dog Bullying Other Dogs? Here’s What To Do by Lindsay Boyers on 2024-10-17](https://be.chewy.com/dog-bullying/)\nIf you notice your pup plays rough with others despite obvious cues to stop, or they keep stealing another dog’s toy or incessantly barking in their face, you may be thinking, “My dog is a bully.” And you could be right. It’s likely that you’re witnessing dog bullying. More specifically, you’re witnessing displacement behavior stemming from conflict.\n\nWhile this behavior usually isn’t malicious, no one wants their beloved four-legged best friend to be the bully (or get bullied) at the dog park.\n\nWe talked to two experts about how to identify a dog bullying other dogs, where this displacement behavior comes from, and how to teach dogs new, more socially acceptable behaviors.\n\nMany things can contribute to dogs exhibiting bullying behavior, including maternal stress, genetics, environments, socialization, and learned behaviors. Here are the most common causes:\n\nPoor or Inadequate Socialization\n\nA dog’s socialization window is between 2–18 weeks of age. During the socialization period, dogs learn how to interact with other dogs and how to read body language.\n\nA lack of socialization in their younger years is often the root cause of bullying behavior, says Brett Reynolds, CPDT-KA, a dog trainer and director of dog care at The Dog Stop®, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nWhen dogs fail to recognize signs of distress or discomfort from a social partner, bullying can be the result, he says. This is common in some rescue situations when dogs just don’t know what the right behavior is.\n\nIncompatibility of Playmates\n\nIf both parties aren’t on the same page about what’s fun, the more overbearing, high-energy dog can be seen as bullying.\n\nGenetic Predisposition\n\nCertain breed groups that prefer rough-and-tumble or hard, physical interactions are often labeled as bullies.\n\nDr. Sinn, who is also a dog trainer, says herding dogs, like Border Collies, may often come across as bullying because their natural herding instincts can be off-putting to other dogs.\n\nOpportunity\n\nSometimes dogs are opportunistic and take advantage of others that they perceive as easy targets, says Reynolds.\n\nBoredom/Lack of Exercise\n\nIf a dog isn’t getting enough exercise or mental stimulation, they might have pent-up energy that comes out as rough play.\n\nFrustration\n\nJust like with humans, frustration can manifest as bad behavior, especially if the other dog isn’t responding to the bully dog’s attempt at play.\n\nOverstimulation\n\nSome dogs get overstimulated or over-aroused like a hyperactive toddler, Dr. Sinn says. When this happens, they have no impulse control.\n\nIf you notice your pup bullying dogs, the next question becomes: “What should I do if my dog is harassing their playmate?” Fortunately, you can try to modify your dog’s behavior and encourage appropriate play. Modification introduces a behavior that’s more socially acceptable.\n\nRemove Them From the Situation\n\nThe best—and most important—thing you can do is remove them from the situation. It’s incumbent on the owner of the dog who is showing inappropriate behavior to act as a social coach to intervene and interrupt, Dr. Sinn says.\n\nSome people think these situations are just a dog being a dog and that they’ll work it out on their own. While that’s true to an extent, Dr. Sinn says it’s up to you to intervene if your dog is being wildly inappropriate.\n\nThis doesn’t mean getting into the middle of a dog fight if the situation has escalated, but if your dog is exhibiting bullying behavior, get them away from the other dog before the situation gets worse.\n\nLook for Patterns\n\nIf your dog is frequently showing signs of bullying, Dr. Sinn recommends assessing what situations cause your dog to get overstimulated or out of control. Something is likely going on that’s too much for the dog, she says.\n\nIf you can identify patterns, make changes in how you approach playtime. For example, instead of going to a dog park with 100 dogs, you may want to set up a one-on-one playdate with another dog whom your pup knows. It’s helpful if the two dogs have a similar play style.\n\nIf your dog only shows signs of bullying around dogs who are bigger or smaller than them, try to limit social interactions to other dogs of the same size.\n\nLead With Positive Reinforcement\n\nWhile your first instinct may be to yell or yank your dog away, this can contribute to your dog being overwhelmed and anxious, and make the situation worse. Instead, remain calm and do what you can to de-escalate the situation.\n\nDr. Sinn says the best approach is to:\n\nRecall your dog.\n\nPraise them for listening to the command.\n\nAsk them to sit with you until they can take things down a notch.\n\nSecure them with a leash for a while (if they're off-leash), so you have more control over the situation.\n\nThis is called downshifting, and the idea is that when you remove the dog from the excitement for a bit, they’ll calm down and be able to return being less overwhelmed.\n\nGet Professional Training\n\nIf you can’t get a handle on the situation on your own, Dr. Sinn says you may want to get help from a professional trainer.\n\nA professional trainer can help you interpret your dog’s behavior and whether it’s normal or abnormal, then work with you to properly train both you and your dog. (It’s important that you know what normal behavior looks like and what’s socially acceptable—and how you can help your dog!)\n\nThey’ll also be able to teach the dog appropriate cues, so you intervene more effectively when needed.\n\nThe best way to make sure your dog isn’t bullying other dogs is to prevent it in the first place. Below are some things you can try.\n\nProper Socialization\n\nProper socialization is one of the most important things that prevents bullying, Dr. Sinn says. Ideally, you’ll expose them to different people, dogs, and environments when they’re young. This can help them develop proper social cues.\n\nHowever, if you have an older dog, it’s not too late. You can still work on socialization, but you might benefit from a professional trainer’s help.\n\nGive Them Basic Training\n\nIf they’re not already trained, making sure your dog understands and listens to basic commands can go a long way to prevent bullying, says Dr. Sinn.\n\nIt’s important that they come when called, as this ensures you can intervene and give the dog a minute to take a breather.\n\nPositive Reinforcement\n\nPositive reinforcement is important even if your dog is exhibiting unwanted behavior. Dr. Sinn says the goal is to reward good behavior—not punish any behavior.\n\nWhen your dog responds to your commands or plays well with others, give them a highly motivating treat.\n\nOver time, this positive response can help discourage bullying. Again, it may be helpful to work with a professional trainer, especially with older dogs.\n\nSo, how can you help a dog who may be getting bullied? Our experts recommend the following.\n\nRemove Them From the Situation\n\nJust like the reverse (when your dog is the bully), you’ll want to remove your dog from any bullying situation. Ideally, the other dog’s parent would get the offending dog to back off, but if that’s not happening, you must control what you can—and that’s your own dog.\n\nDon’t confront the other owner or try to pull the canine bully away from your dog. Instead, take your dog and leave the situation as calmly as possible.\n\nDon’t Escalate Things\n\nWith human bullies, the advice is often to stand up for yourself, but it’s different in the canine world. You don’t want to encourage your dog to engage or try to get your dog to be more assertive.\n\nDr. Sinn says this can trigger a fight, which could quickly turn into an emergency. Instead, stay calm and remove your dog from the situation.\n\nReconsider Play Sessions\n\nIf your dog getting bullied is an isolated event, removing them from the situation should do the trick. But if this is a regular occurrence, you may want to rethink playtime.\n\nDr. Sinn recommends taking note of overwhelming situations and finding more socially appropriate places for your dog to have fun. If it’s one particular dog bullying your dog, you might have to end that friendship and find other doggy companions with play behavior that more closely aligns with your dog’s.\n\nIf your dog seems to always get bullied, skip the dog parks and consider lower-key options, like playdates with one or two good friends; a more stable small group of dogs; or an in-home daycare instead.",
      "# [7 Cat Laxatives To Relieve Cat Constipation (and How to Choose the Right One) by Katie Koschalk on 2024-01-11](https://be.chewy.com/cat-laxatives/)\nNormally, a cat’s digestive system purrs right along, smoothly and without a hitch. But sometimes things can get a bit clogged, leading to constipation.\n\nSo, how do you get things moving again? A common approach is the use of cat laxatives, which help stimulate a bowel movement.\n\nThere are seven commonly used cat laxatives, but choosing the right one—with the guidance of your veterinarian—depends on a variety of factors, including the cause of constipation; your cat’s overall health and age; and any underlying medical conditions they have.\n\nWe spoke to vet experts to get the inside scoop on constipation and cat laxatives, including how they can help your furry pal and how to choose the right one.\n\nWhat Is Cat Constipation?\n\nCat constipation is a common health issue where a cat experiences difficulty passing feces or poops less frequently than normal, says Dr. Winnie Ybarra, DVM, DACVIM, a veterinary internist at San Francisco Animal Medical Center in San Francisco.\n\nCats typically poop once per day, although some poop twice daily. Pooping less than this could be a sign of constipation.\n\nAccording to Dr. Nicole Savageau, VMD, a veterinarian with The Vets in Austin, Texas, common causes of constipation in cats include:\n\nDehydration\n\nLack of exercise\n\nStress and anxiety\n\nHairballs\n\nDietary issues and food changes\n\nInflammatory bowel disease\n\nMore serious causes can include pelvic injuries; a blockage due to a foreign body; kidney disease; megacolon (a condition where the colon becomes enlarged); neurological issues; and some types of cancer. In some cases, no underlying cause of constipation can be determined.\n\nSymptoms of Cat Constipation\n\nUnlike humans, cats can’t verbally communicate their discomfort, so it’s important for cat parents to be observant of their feline’s behavior and bodily functions. Recognizing the symptoms of constipation in cats is crucial for timely and effective treatment.\n\nBelow, Dr. Ybarra shares some common symptoms of constipation to watch for.\n\nInfrequent or no bowel movements\n\nHard, round, dry feces (as opposed to well-formed, slightly soft feces)\n\nStraining in the litter box; spending a long time in the litter box; or avoiding the litter box altogether\n\nDisplaying signs of pain or discomfort (like crying out) while trying to defecate\n\nBloody or mucus-covered stools\n\nBlood or mucus around the rectum\n\nLethargy or reduced activity\n\nPoor appetite\n\nVomiting\n\nAbdominal bloating\n\nHow to Help a Constipated Cat: Cat Laxatives\n\nWhen your cat is suffering from constipation, there are several steps you can take to help alleviate their discomfort and address the underlying issue. We’ll touch on the full gamut shortly, but first, let’s zero in on laxatives.\n\nCat laxatives are substances designed to help cats with constipation by facilitating bowel movements. They work in various ways, such as stimulating intestinal muscles or drawing water into the colon.\n\n4 Types of Cat Laxatives\n\nThe choice of laxative depends on the severity of the constipation and the cat’s overall health. There are four main types of laxatives:\n\nLubricant laxatives: Coats the stool and intestines in a lubricating film, easing the passage of feces.\n\nOsmotic laxatives: Draws water into the colon from surrounding tissues. This increased water content helps soften the stool and increases its volume, which, in turn, stimulates bowel movements.\n\nStimulant laxatives: Triggers the intestines to contract and push out the stool.\n\nBulk-forming laxatives: Provides fiber, which increases the bulk of the stool. This can stimulate a cat’s bowels.\n\n7 Common Cat Laxatives\n\nAccording to Dr. Ybarra and Dr. Savageau, common cat laxatives include:\n\nCat Lax (lubricant)\n\nMineral oil (lubricant)\n\nPolyethylene glycol 3350, aka Miralax (osmotic)\n\nLactulose (osmotic)\n\nCisapride (stimulant)\n\nMetoclopramide (stimulant)\n\nPsyllium husk, aka Metamucil (bulk-forming)\n\nWhile not technically a laxative, canned, unsweetened pumpkin can also sometimes help relieve constipation. Pumpkins have a high water and fiber content, and can hydrate the intestines and their contents. A couple of pet parent pumpkin favorites are Weruva Pureed Pumpkin and Nummy Tum-Tum Pumpkin. Note that these pumpkin foods should not replace your cat’s regular food but rather act as a supplement to relieve occasional constipation.\n\nWeruva Pumpkin Patch Up! Dog & Cat Pouches, case of 12\n\n$12.95\n\nCat Lax Cat Supplement\n\n$10.23\n\nWhich Cat Laxative Should You Use?\n\nThe right laxative for your cat depends on a variety of factors, including the cause of constipation; your cat’s overall health and age; and any underlying medical conditions, says Dr. Ybarra.\n\nIt’s crucial to only give your cat a laxative based on a veterinarian’s recommendation and with their guidance. This not only ensures the treatment’s efficacy but also your feline friend’s safety and well-being. The improper or unsupervised use of laxatives can lead to complications such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalances or worsened constipation.\n\nIn addition to selecting a suitable laxative, your vet may also discuss other aspects of care that can help manage or prevent constipation.\n\nCat Laxative vs. Stool Softener\n\nWhen addressing constipation in cats, it’s important to understand the difference between a cat laxative and a stool softener for cats, as they serve different purposes in managing the condition.\n\nCat Laxatives\n\nLaxatives are generally used when there’s a need to actively induce a bowel movement.\n\nThey produce bowel movements in one of three ways:\n\nStimulating the muscles of the intestines\n\nDrawing water into the bowel from surrounding tissues\n\nIncreasing the weight or “bulk” of the stool\n\nStool Softeners\n\nStool softeners, on the other hand, work by increasing the amount of water absorbed by the stool in the intestines, Dr. Savageau says. This process results in softer stool, which is easier for the cat to pass.\n\nStool softeners are particularly beneficial for cats who need to avoid straining during defecation, such as those with certain medical conditions or post-surgical cases.\n\nIn some cases, both laxatives and stool softeners are used.\n\nWhen to Go to the Vet\n\nIf not properly treated, constipation in cats can lead to several health risks, some of which can be life-threatening, such as:\n\nMegacolon: A condition where the colon becomes abnormally enlarged and loses its ability to function properly. This can be caused by the colon being consistently stretched more than it should be, such as when a cat has chronic constipation.\n\nObstipation: A severe form of constipation where a cat cannot pass any stool or gas, usually due to fecal matter becoming dry and hard in the intestines.\n\nToxemia: A condition that can occur when prolonged constipation leads to the accumulation and stagnation of feces in the colon. This stagnation can result in the absorption of toxins into the bloodstream.\n\nDue to these risks, it’s essential to treat constipation promptly. If constipation persists for more than 24–48 hours, bring your cat to a veterinarian. The doctor can assess your cat’s health; work to determine the underlying cause; and provide a treatment plan.\n\nCat Constipation Treatment\n\nDr. Savageau shares some common cat constipation remedies, including:\n\nIncrease water intake: Dehydration is a common cause of constipation. Ensure your cat has access to fresh, clean water at all times. Consider using a cat water fountain, such as the Drinkwell Pet Fountain or Catit Flower Fountain, as cats often prefer running water. Learn more tips to get your kitty to drink more water.\n\nDietary changes: Your vet might recommend incorporating more fiber and water into your cat’s diet through wet food, specially formulated cat food or nutritional supplements, such as psyllium husk or canned pumpkin. A higher fiber diet should be introduced gradually to avoid upsetting your cat’s stomach.\n\nLaxatives or stool softeners: Your vet might give your cat specific laxatives or stool softeners to get things moving or soften the stool.\n\nExercise: Encourage your cat to engage in regular physical activity. Play sessions can help stimulate digestion and bowel movements.\n\nReducing stress: In some cases, stress and anxiety can cause constipation. Stress can be caused by big things like adding a new pet to the house, or smaller things like construction noise outside. Soothing your cat, and reducing or removing environmental stress, if possible, could help ease constipation. Explore popular cat calming aids.\n\nUltimately, the treatment for constipation depends on its severity, adds Dr. Ybarra. “If the constipation is mild, adding water, canned food or fiber to the diet can help,” she says. If it’s more severe, enemas (performed by a vet) and medication might be needed. “Very severe cases require manual deobstipation under anesthesia,” she says.\n\nBy recognizing the symptoms of constipation, knowing when to seek veterinary assistance and understanding the treatment options available, you can ensure your cat remains comfortable and healthy.\n\nLooking for more information surrounding kitty bathroom conundrums?

      "# [28 Most Beautiful Cat Breeds in the World by Annie Butler Shirreffs on 2024-04-03](https://be.chewy.com/beautiful-cats/)\nWhat makes a cat beautiful? For some people, the cat breed’s coat color or pattern put them on the most beautiful cats list. For others, it’s the color of the eyes.\n\nFor Rick Hoskinson, an all-breed judge with The International Cat Association (TICA), a registry of purebred cats, it’s a combination of these qualities that makes a cat truly striking. “A beautifully balanced cat with stunning condition is always an attention getter,” he says. “A cat with a striking coat pattern and eye color is also beautiful.”\n\nA beautiful cat is like a beautiful work of art, says Teresa Keiger, an all-breed judge with the pedigreed cat registry Cat Fanciers’ Association (CFA). She explains that a “balanced” cat means that all body parts are in harmony with each other—where no one aspect dominates and all body parts fit together as a whole. “With some breeds, all the parts might be very different. But put them all together, and you have one lovely piece.”\n\n16 Beautiful Cats\n\nWith the help of current CFA and TICA registration lists, input from all-breed judges Keiger and Hoskinson and a couple of informal polls, we came up with the following list of beautiful cats, who (bonus!) also happen to be friendly and people-oriented.\n\nBut before we start, a word of warning: The topic of most beautiful domestic cat breeds is very subjective. Every cat enthusiast, every cat parent and every cat breed judge has their own idea of the most beautiful cats in the world. So, we hope you enjoy—and agree with—our picks.\n\nAbyssinian\n\nWe start our list with one of the oldest known cat breeds. The Abyssinian’s defining feature is a richly colored, ticked tabby coat in which each hair is ticked with four to six bands of color—dark at the tip, lighter at the roots and alternating dark and light. The original coat color is known as ruddy, but the Abyssinian also comes in different shades, including red, blue and fawn. The face features dramatic markings that don’t appear anywhere else on the body.\n\nAbyssinians are extremely graceful and elegant. They remind Keiger of male ballet dancers—“muscular, lithe and seeming to be barely standing on the Earth.”\n\nAmerican Shorthair\n\nA replication of the short-haired cats who came with settlers from Europe to North America, American Shorthairs are known as America’s shorthaired breed. “Often referred to as a ‘working cat’—which the breed originally was—the muscular body shows this,” says Keiger, who serves as editor of CFA’s Cat Talk magazine.\n\nThe short coats have a hard, dense and lustrous texture, giving the breed a natural protective appearance. They come in a variety of colors (like white, black, blue aka gray, and brown) and patterns (like calico, tortoiseshell and bi-color), but the most popular—and recognizable—color and pattern is a silver base with black tabby markings. These tabby markings create swirls all over the body, broken “necklaces” that highlight the chest, rings around the legs and an “M” mark on the forehead.\n\nBengal\n\nSeeing spots? You’re probably looking at a Bengal cat. Originally developed from crosses between domestic cats and the Asian leopard cat, Bengals are most noted for their richly colored, highly contrasted coat of vivid spots and distinctive marbling. “What I find so striking about the Bengal is the color and pattern,” Keiger says. Some have rosettes like those found on leopards, jaguars and ocelots. In fact, the Bengal is the only domestic cat with rosettes. Some Bengal coats even feature “glitter,” which gives each hair an iridescent sheen. Not only beautiful to behold, the Bengal coat is also soft and luxurious to the touch, having “a pelt-like feel that no other breed has,” Keiger says.\n\nCombine the Bengal’s distinctive coat with their wild expression, created by tabby facial markings and large oval eyes, and it’s easy to see why this breed has captivated many cat lovers.\n\nBirman\n\nKnown for a soft, silky, lush coat and soulful, deep-blue eyes, the Birman is classified as a pointed breed, which means the cat will have different, darker colors on the face, ears, feet and tail. Keiger says the Birman comes dressed for a party, as the breed also has a white spotting pattern with white “gloves” on all paws and “laces” up the back legs. She also points out their expressive eyes.\n\nKnown as “The Sacred Cat of Burma,” the Birman comes in a rainbow of colors, and the beautiful coat features a longer ruff round the neck and a fluffy tail. The pattern within their points can be solid, tabby or tortoiseshell.\n\nLike all color-point breeds, the Birman is born white, with the color developing as they mature.\n\nBritish Shorthair\n\nAnother of the oldest known breeds, everything about the British Shorthair is round—ears, tail, paws and expressive eyes in a round head with round cheeks.\n\nBest known for their gray (also known as blue) coat, the British Shorthair comes in a variety of colors. And that coat! Keiger says the British Shorthair has the densest coat of any of the CFA breeds—“one that you just want to squeeze and run your fingers through all day.”\n\nAnd here’s a fun fact: It’s believed that the British Shorthair was the inspiration for the Cheshire Cat in Lewis Carroll’s “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.”\n\nBurmese\n\nCompact and muscular, the Burmese is surprisingly heavy for their size, and that little body is covered with a silky, close-lying coat.\n\nThe Burmese’s original color is sable (a warm, rich brown), but they also come in a variety of colors, including champagne (a warm beige), blue (a medium gray) and a soft chocolate.\n\nAnd nestled in these beautiful colors is a pair of round, gold eyes that Keiger says are very expressive.\n\nDevon Rex\n\nIs it an alien? Is it an elf? Nope—it’s a Devon Rex! Known as the pixies of the cat world, the Devon Rex’s appearance is far from ordinary—a long, skinny neck, elfin face, oversized ears and large, impish eyes.\n\nPerhaps the most distinctive feature of the Devon Rex is their coat, which is velvety soft and ripples with curls. Those curls are a result of a natural mutation and appear everywhere on the body. “Even its whiskers are curled,” Keiger says.\n\nThe coat ranges from a mop of curls to a suede-like coat and comes in all colors and patterns.\n\nEuropean Burmese\n\nThe European Burmese is a cousin to the “American” Burmese above. While the Burmese has a compact, well-rounded appearance, the European Burmese is somewhat longer with gently rounded contours. The European Burmese is also slightly larger, and has a more pronounced, longer muzzle.\n\nThe biggest and most obvious difference between the two is the array of colors seen in the European Burmese—all 10 of them.\n\nThe eye shape differs between the breeds as well. Keiger says the European Burmese has sultry eyes that suck you right in. “They’re slightly hooded on the top, fully round on the bottom, and incredibly lustrous and deep in color.”\n\nPersian\n\nEasily one of the most recognizable breeds, the Persian is the quintessential “fluffy cat.” Because of that fluffy coat, these long-haired cats appear larger than they actually are. The luxurious coat is quite long and comes in a variety of colors and patterns.\n\n“The breed standard calls for a ‘sweet expression,’ so being beautiful is part of its overall being,” Keiger says. That sweet expression rests on a flat face with large, round, expressive eyes.\n\nExotic\n\nThe short-haired cousin of the Persian cat, the Exotic (also called the Exotic Shorthair) has the same round head, sweet open expression, flat profile and large, expressive eyes.\n\nThey’re bred to meet the Persian standard in every way but one. Instead of long hair, the Exotic has a thick, short coat. “You’ll revel in stroking the plush, dense coat,” Keiger says.\n\nThat short coat is unique to the Exotic, giving them a soft, rounded, teddy bear look, and it requires much less grooming than a Persian, hence the affectionate nickname “the lazy man’s Persian.”\n\nLike the Persian, the Exotic comes in a variety of colors and patterns.\n\nMaine Coon Cat\n\nKnown as “gentle giants,” Maine Coons are one of the most popular breeds in the United States. In fact, for the first time in, well, ever, the Maine Coon Cat surpassed the Bengal to become the No. 1 cat on TICA’s most recent Top 10 Breeds list.\n\nThe Maine Coon Cat is a great example of “survival of the fittest” evolution. Long-haired cats came with the settlers to the United States, and these cats naturally developed into sturdy, working cats suited to the Northeast’s harsh winters, which explains the long coat (of three distinct lengths!), a long tail they can wrap around their bodies, and their well-tufted ears and feet. Keiger says that the gorgeous, long coat comes in a wide variety of striking colors and patterns.\n\nSiamese\n\nEverything about the Siamese cat is long and sleek—long body, long head, long legs and long tail. These long, chiseled lines coupled with the angular, wedge-shaped head makes the Siamese look rather sophisticated.\n\nIn contrast to the long body, the Siamese coat is short and silky. “A good Siamese doesn’t even appear to have a coat, as it lies so close to the body,” Keiger says.\n\nThe Siamese sports a pointed coat, with seal (a dark brown) being one of the most well-known colors. But the points appear in three other colors, too: chocolate, blue and lilac. This pointed pattern accentuates the breed’s almond-shaped, blue eyes.\n\nOriental\n\nA member of the Siamese group, the Oriental has the same body type as their Siamese parent: elegant, long, lithe and slender. What makes the Oriental distinct is their wide array of colors and patterns combined with a short, sleek coat. Keiger calls the Oriental a Siamese with a different pattern—300 plus of them, in fact.\n\nThe Oriental comes in both longhair and shorthair varieties, adding the opportunity for even more breathtaking colors and patterns.\n\nRagdoll\n\nHitting No. 1 on CFA’s most recent Top 10 list, the Ragdoll is one of the largest breeds in the cat fancy. These big, laid back cats live up to their name by the way they happily get carried around by their people. They have a luxurious semi-long coat that’s silky, soft and plush, which Keiger says makes you want to just pick up the cat and cuddle them. But perhaps the first thing you might notice are their deep blue eyes that just pull you right in.\n\nThe Ragdoll cat comes in several coat colors (like chocolate, red and blue) and patterns (like colorpoint, bi-color and mitted).\n\nRussian Blue\n\nThe hallmark of this gorgeous breed is their bright, blue coat. The hairs are tipped with silver, giving the Russian Blue a glistening and shimmering look as the cat moves. The color itself is beautiful to look at, but the short, silky, dense coat is plush to the touch. You can even draw patterns in the coat with your fingers that will remain until you smooth them out again. Rounding out the Russian Blue’s beauty is their deep, emerald green eyes that, contrasted against the gray coat, are quite striking.\n\nKeiger, who has worked with the breed for more than 25 years, says the Russian Blue has a regal appearance as well. “I’ve had spectators comment that the Russian Blue ‘looks like a statue!’”\n\nScottish Fold\n\nThe first time Keiger saw a Scottish Fold, she thought the cat looked like an owl. “Its ears were folded so tightly against its round head that they were barely discernible,” she says. Those unique ears come from a natural genetic mutation, but not to worry! Their ears work just as well as any other cats’.\n\nScottish Fold kittens are born with straight ears, and at about 3 to 4 weeks of age, their ears fold—or not. Not all Scottish Folds have folded ears, but Keiger points out that those with upright ears have the same large, padded body, large, round head and expressive round eyes.\n\nThe Scottish Fold can be both short-haired and long-haired with a dense, plush coat that comes in all colors and patterns.\n\n12 Beautiful Rare Cat Breeds\n\nSome breeds (like the ones above) are a bit more mainstream and higher in popularity. But these rare breeds are sure to wow you as well.\n\nAmerican Curl\n\nUnique ears that curl back in a graceful arc give the American Curl an alert and happily surprised expression. Designed by Mother Nature herself, the ears arc gently backward and point toward the back of the skull. But the American Curl is actually born with straight ears. In three to five days, the ears start to curl back, staying in a tight rosebud position, then gradually unfurling until they permanently “set” at around 4 months of age.\n\nAlong with the striking, curved-back ears, Keiger says the American Curl is also a very graceful-appearing cat, with an elegant body, silky, flat-lying coat and expressive, walnut-shaped eyes.\n\nBombay\n\nWant a little panther in your life? Look no further than the Bombay. An example of a hybrid breed, which combines established characteristics of domestic breeds to create a specific, third look, the Bombay is a combination of black American Shorthairs and Burmese. Keiger says the Bombay resembles the Burmese, but they are larger with a somewhat longer head and slightly larger body.\n\nNicknamed “the patent-leather kid with the new-penny eyes,” the Bombay comes in one color: black. But it’s a deep, dense black with a high-gloss sheen. The coat is short and tight. Their beautiful eyes are anywhere from deep, rich gold to copper—just like a new copper penny.\n\nAdding to the breed’s beauty, Bombays sport a sweet facial expression and have a cute little sway when they walk, similar to that of an Indian black leopard.\n\nChartreux\n\nKeiger thinks of the Chartreux as a study in asymmetrical balance. “None of the body parts should go together, but they do and go together beautifully,” she says. The Chartreux is both robust and elegant, with a muscular body set upon finely boned legs and dainty feet, which makes them often described as a “potato on toothpicks.”\n\nThis natural, historic breed of France has been known for centuries for both their unique coat texture and blue color. The coat is medium-short in length and slightly wooly in texture, and the blue color can range from light ash to deep slate.\n\nThe Chartreux’s large, expressive eyes are one of their most endearing features. “The copper to orange-colored eyes just pop against the blue fur,” Keiger says.\n\nCornish Rex\n\nKeiger calls the Cornish Rex a study in curves, arches and more curves. While these cats appear fine-boned and dainty, they are actually hard-bodied and muscular, slender with a deep curve to the chest rising up to a tucked-up waist, which is why they’re often referred to as the Greyhound of the cat world.\n\nTheir head is egg-shaped and topped with tall ears, while their expressive oval eyes have a slight upward slant.\n\nBut the most unique feature of the Cornish Rex is their coat, which is noticeably curly, falling into marcel waves. Even the eyebrows and whiskers are curled. The coat, which comes in all colors and patterns, is short, close to the body and incredibly soft to the touch.\n\nEgyptian Mau\n\nThe Egyptian Mau has the distinction of being the only naturally spotted domestic cat breed (the spots are not bred in) And those spots appear everywhere across their elegant body, Keiger says. The spots can be random and of any size.\n\nA natural breed, the Egyptian Mau comes in colors that occurred naturally: silver, bronze, smoke and black (as well as dilute versions of these colors). Their body is muscular and graceful. When standing, the Egyptian Mau has a “tiptoe stance,” as their hind legs are longer than their front legs. And their mesmerizing, gooseberry-green eyes are large and alert. The way they are set gives the cat a cute, “worried” look.\n\nHavana Brown\n\nThe elegant Havana Brown comes in one color: a rich, mahogany red-brown—with matching whiskers! “The short and smooth coat shows off the Havana’s graceful lines,” Keiger says.\n\nThe Havana also has a distinctive head shape that sets this breed apart. The head is slightly longer than it is wide, narrowing to a one-of-a-kind muzzle that’s often compared to a corn cob stuck on the end of the face. Keiger says the entire head structure may remind one of the shape of a light bulb, as the muzzle is so distinctly separate.\n\nThat unique face also includes brilliant green eyes—the greener, the better!\n\nJapanese Bobtail\n\nKnown as the good luck cat of Japan, the Japanese Bobtail is an ancient breed that has been portrayed in Japanese manuscripts and paintings for at least 1,000 years. If you’ve ever seen a ceramic cat with a raised, beckoning paw in shop windows or doorways, this is the cat!\n\nThe Japanese Bobtail has elegant high cheekbones and large oval-shaped eyes, but their most unique feature is their bobbed tail that consists of a variety of angles, curves and kinks that create a pom-pom effect. Not only is the tail unique to the breed but to each individual cat. No two tails are ever the same. The hair on the tail is longer than the hair on the body, contributing to the pom-pom look.\n\nKorat\n\nAnother good luck cat, this one hailing from Thailand, the Korat is a compact, powerful cat with a single, close-lying coat that allows their rippling muscles to show. Their unique color—defined as silver-tipped blue—gives the cat a shimmering quality. The color also absorbs light, creating a halo effect. Keiger says it resembles the color of rain clouds. “With luminous, green eyes, the silver-tipped blue coat really does seem to glow all over.”\n\nWe should also mention that the Korat’s head resembles a heart shape. As Keiger says, “One can’t help but love a cat with a heart-shaped head!”\n\nNorwegian Forest Cat\n\nA relatively new and rare breed in the U.S., the Norwegian Forest Cat is a very old breed in their native Norway and has been featured in folk tales and mythology for centuries.\n\nKnown in Norway as the skogkatt (which literally means forest cat), the Norwegian Forest Cat sports a lavish coat that served as natural protection back when they lived in the forest. The lavish coat makes this already large breed look even larger. The insulated, waterproof double coat was designed to withstand Scandinavian winters and features a full frontal ruff (hair around the neck), bushy tail, rear britches and tufted paws. “They really do look as though they walked out of a fairy-tale forest,” Keiger says,\n\nOften known for their brown tabby-and-white coats, Norwegian Forest cats actually come in nearly every possible coat pattern and color combination, except pointed, chocolate and lilac.\n\nSiberian\n\nStill fairly rare in the U.S., Siberian cats are a Russian national treasure that have been documented for hundreds of years and mentioned in Russian fairy tales and children’s books.\n\nA natural breed, the Siberian’s thick, rich triple coat protected the cats from the elements in their native country. The Siberian is considered a semi-longhair, but their coats vary with the seasons—a thick full coat in the winter and shedding down to a shorter, less dense coat in the summer.\n\nThe beautiful coat comes complete with a neck ruff, fluffy britches, a bushy tail, and hairs in and on top of the ears. “Plus, they possess some of the most unusual colors and patterns of all cats,” Keiger says.\n\nSomali\n\nThe Somali is essentially a long-haired Abyssinian, the result of a recessive gene in the Abyssinian breed. Their long hair is soft and finely textured, and comes in the same colors as the Abyssinian. Their vibrantly colored coat, striking facial markings, large ears and bushy tail give the cat a captivating, little fox look. And as Keiger says, who wouldn’t want to live with a cat that resembles a fox?\n\nTurkish Angora\n\nThe rare and beautiful Turkish Angora is considered a national treasure in their native Turkey with good reason—this breed is the epitome of elegance. Lithe and finely boned, the Turkish Angora is graceful and energetic. “The triangular head with flat planes and highly set ears just complete the image of a living work of art,” Keiger says.\n\nThat elegant body is covered with a semi-long, soft silky coat that rarely mats. The head is crowned with large, erect and tufted ears, and the tail streams behind them in a long plume. Although a white coat with blue eyes is favored in Turkey and was the original color of the breed when introduced into the U.S., the breed comes in a variety of colors and patterns.\n\nBottom line? Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. These are just some of the beautiful cats out there, each with their own distinctive looks, personalities and behaviors.

      "# [5 Cat Health Conditions Veterinary Exclusive Diets Help Support by Jennifer Coates, DVM, Jennifer Coates on 2018-09-20](https://be.chewy.com/5-cat-health-conditions-veterinary-exclusive-diets-help-support)\n1\n\nFeline Lower Urinary Tract Disease\n\nAppropriate treatment depends on the specific disease involved. For example, some types of bladder stones require surgical removal while others can be dissolved with a diet change.\n\nFeeding cats a veterinary exclusive diet in the first place can help prevent FLUTD because these foods promote overall urinary health and limit the formation of crystals and stones.\n\n2\n\nCat Constipation\n\nCats who experience constipation once are more likely to become constipated again. The increased risk may be related to diet, lifestyle or an underlying health problem.\n\nCat constipation symptoms to watch out for include a cat straining to defecate, painful defecation, abdominal discomfort, poor appetite and a cat producing hard feces or small amounts of liquid feces.\n\nOnce a veterinarian removes any feces that are stuck in the cat’s colon, he or she often will recommend a veterinary exclusive diet to help prevent a reoccurrence of constipation. Diets that contain highly digestible proteins, prebiotics, omega-3 fatty acids, and soluble and insoluble fiber sources can help promote a healthy digestive function.\n\n3\n\nFeline Food Allergies\n\nCat food allergies can cause skin and/or digestive problems in affected cats. The most common sign is itchiness, which may be accompanied by ear infections, skin lesions and sometimes poor appetite, vomiting and diarrhea.\n\nBecause other health problems have similar clinical signs, a food trial using a veterinary exclusive diet is necessary before a vet can definitively diagnose a cat with a food allergy.\n\nResearch shows that the most common feline food allergens are beef, fish and chicken.* Therefore, a diet made from unique protein sources, like rabbit, can be used to diagnose as well as treat food allergies in cats. Another option is to feed that cat a diet made from proteins that have been broken down into tiny fragments that are no longer allergenic.\n\n4\n\nKidney Disease\n\nKidney disease is the leading killer of older cats. If caught early, however, you can help your cat thrive for a longer period of time. Initial symptoms of kidney disease in cats include increased thirst, increased urination, poor appetite and weight loss.\n\nAmong other functions, the kidneys remove nitrogenous waste products from a cat’s bloodstream. Certain foods can help reduce the production of these nitrogenous waste products and can help cats feel better, improve their appetite and even increase their lifespan.\n\nFoods that are designed for cats with kidney disease and have many options for taste and texture can help appeal to even the most finicky feline.\n\n5\n\nDiabetes Mellitus\n\nAt no time does food play a bigger role in disease management than when a cat develops diabetes. The interplay between diet and insulin, whether it still is produced by the cat’s pancreas or is given by injection, is critical.\n\nDiets that are high in protein, low in carbohydrate and provide a proper mix of dietary fiber can help moderate the wild swings in blood sugar levels that put a diabetic cat’s health and life at risk.\n\nEarly signs of feline diabetes include increased thirst, increased urination and weight loss despite a good appetite. If you notice these or any other worrisome symptoms, talk to your veterinarian and ask if a Royal Canin veterinary exclusive diet might be in your pet’s best interest.\n\nRegular veterinary visits are essential to your cat’s health. They enable your veterinarian to uncover health concerns earlier. As cats get older, schedule twice-yearly senior wellness visits. Of course, any health concerns you have in-between checkups also should be addressed in a timely manner.\n\nBy: Dr. Jennifer Coates\n\nDr. Jennifer Coates was valedictorian of her graduating class at the VA-MD Regional College of Veterinary Medicine and has practiced in Virginia, Wyoming, and Colorado in the years since.

      "# [5 Common Bird Beak Health Problems by Chewy Editorial on 2015-04-27](https://be.chewy.com/5-common-bird-beak-health-problems)\nA wide number of health problems can impact a bird’s beak, either directly or indirectly. The most commonly seen by veterinarians are:\n\n1.Trauma\n\nBirds can injure their beaks as a result of fighting between other birds; falling onto hard floors; chewing on electric cords; flying into windows or ceiling fans; and their beak becoming trapped between cage bars. These injuries can result in fractures to the beak, puncture wounds or avulsions (the beak becoming partially or completely torn off the face). Beak injuries are almost always emergency situations that require immediate attention from a veterinarian.\n\n2. Abnormal Beak Growth & Development\n\nSome baby birds develop beak abnormalities. These can include an overgrown beak, where either the upper or lower beak grows too long; a scissor beak, which is a lateral deviation of the upper and lower beaks; and mandibular prognathism (parrot underbite), which is a condition wherein the tip of the rhinotheca rests on or inside the gnatotheca. These can be caused by genetics and nutritional deficiencies during development. Often these conditions can be fixed with dental appliances, which work similar to human braces to straighten out the beak and correct bites.\n\n3. Cancer\n\nBirds can develop cancer on their beaks, primarily squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma. This can manifest itself as erosion, discoloration and masses on the beak. If caught early, tumors on the beak can normally be removed surgically.\n\n4. Nutritional Deficiencies\n\nLiver disease from excess fat and poor nutrition in the diet can cause overgrown and scaly beaks. Lack of calcium and vitamin D can cause soft, rubbery beaks, mostly in smaller birds such as cockatiels. The solution is simple: get the bird on a proper diet, and, in time, these symptoms can usually be reversed.\n\n5. Infectious Diseases\n\nMany viral, bacterial, parasitic and fungal pathogens can directly infect bird beaks or infect another part of the bird’s body and cause secondary problems to the bill. Some biggies here include scaly leg and face mites, psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD) and avian pox. The bacterial and fungal diseases are usually successfully treated with antibiotics or antifungal medications. The key to treating any of these conditions is careful observation and quick action on your part. If you notice anything unusual about your bird’s beak, contact your veterinarian immediately. The sooner you address the problem, the sooner your bird will be treated and the more likelihood of a good prognosis.\n\nPosted By: Chewy Editorial\n\nFeatured Image: Gina Cioli/Lumina Media",
      "# [Feed for Birds: 7 Backyard Bird Food Options That Aren’t Seeds by Shelby Deering on 2024-08-08](https://be.chewy.com/8-non-seed-wild-bird-foods-for-the-bird-feeder)\nFeeding birds right in your backyard is a fun and rewarding way to view wildlife from your own window. While feeding birds seed from a bird feeder can keep local birds happy and healthy, did you know that you can feed birds non-seed options as well?\n\nNon-seed foods can provide needed fats and nutrients that birds’ bodies need, and can help them feed their young, give them energy for migrating, and keep them well-fed during the winter months.\n\nIf you’d like to try feeding your backyard birds a plethora of non-seed foods, look to this expert-guided list.\n\nWe’re also offering up some different types of ways to feed birds (spoiler: traditional bird feeders aren’t your only option) and providing expert tips for drawing birds to your yard and keeping them happy.\n\nWhat Do Wild Birds Eat?\n\nBirds eat as many different foods as you can think of, says Dana Varble, DVM, CAE, chief veterinary officer with the North American Veterinary Community (NAVC).\n\n“Everything from seeds, fruit, nectar, insects, fish, and other animal protein,” she says. “For the most part, bird feeders attract a wide variety of songbirds, particularly those that utilize seed as an important part of their diet.\n\n\"However, you can experiment with different seed mixes, suet ingredients, and other additional bird foods, such as fresh or dried fruit or even mealworms.”\n\nShe adds that different foods will attract different birds, which is part of the appeal of trying new food sources.\n\nAlso, in many geographic areas the season will also make a big difference in which birds you see and which types of food they are attracted to.\n\n5Vegetables\n\nJust like humans, birds should eat their veggies. Vegetables can be consumed during certain times of the year, such as springtime or in winter when resources are scarce. Go for the green when feeding vegetables to nearby birds, such as:\n\nSpinach\n\nKale\n\nAlfalfa sprouts\n\nBroccoli florets\n\nWild greens are also an option, including:\n\nClover\n\nChickweed\n\nDandelion\n\nPlantains\n\nBirds who consume these vegetables during spring as a source of nutrition include some finches, sparrows, grosbeaks, and waxwings. While other birds like corvids can consume these, they may not choose to, especially when other items are more abundant.\n\nAnd then there’s also corn, which ground foragers like bobwhite quail and doves particularly enjoy— but other species take it opportunistically, such as meadowlarks, towhees, and robins.\n\n6Fruits\n\nBirds nearly always enjoy a sweet treat, and you can provide it in a healthy way by putting out certain fruits. In general, fruit can be provided year-round (feeding these items during times when they are naturally available is best) or as treats during winter when food might be scarcer.\n\nSome large fruits can be cut into slices and hung on metal rods for wild birds to pick at, while others can be placed on platform feeders. Smaller fruits can be mixed in with dry items or placed out on platform feeders by themselves.\n\nKeep in mind that fruits can leave sticky residue on feeders, so they will need to be cleaned more frequently if fruits are given. Be sure to change uneaten fruit regularly before it spoils.\n\nFresh Fruit\n\nFresh fruits for birds can include:\n\nApples\n\nCrabapples\n\nBlueberries\n\nBlackberries\n\nCherries\n\nPears\n\nMulberry\n\nElderberry\n\nPersimmon\n\nRaspberries\n\nGrapes\n\nStrawberries\n\nMany passerines enjoy these foods, including:\n\nCatbirds\n\nChickadees\n\nCrows\n\nHouse finches\n\nPurple finches\n\nGrackles\n\nTitmice\n\nGrosbeaks\n\nJays\n\nOrioles\n\nStarlings\n\nPhoebes\n\nRobins\n\nTanagers\n\nThrushes\n\nWaxwings\n\nSome species of flycatchers and kingbirds may consume a small number of fruits, too.\n\nDried Fruit\n\nDried fruit is also an option. Consider feeding:\n\nRaisins\n\nBlueberries\n\nCranberries\n\nCurrants\n\nThese may be attractive to thrushes, waxwings, catbirds, and mockingbirds. Be sure to feed only dried fruits without added sugar or dry your own.\n\nFor another fruity delicacy, grape jelly can be placed in special feeders for Baltimore orioles.\n\nFruit Trees\n\nYou can also consider fruit-producing trees and shrubs that birds will enjoy in your backyard. Focus on native plantings that provide fruit. These types of plants can include:\n\nBeautyberry\n\nViburnum\n\nHollies (American, Deciduous and Gallberry, which is also known as Inkberry)\n\nDogwood (Flowering, Swamp)\n\nWax Myrtle\n\nBirds like thrushes, warblers, gray catbirds, Northern mockingbirds, Eastern phoebes, Eastern towhees, Northern cardinals, and house finches may flock to these fruit-abundant plantings.\n\nHow To Feed Wild Birds\n\nThere are all sorts of ways you can help birds enjoy some yummy food.\n\nFeeders are a natural place to start. Some feeders are designed to discourage certain unwanted animals, such as squirrels, raccoons, or even specific species of birds that can become pests, Dr. Varble says.\n\nHowever, “some bird species need more space to perch and may prefer open-tray feeders,” she adds. “They may resist perching on feeders with a roof.”\n\nThere are also special feeders that hold nectar for hummingbirds. Feeders that attach to windows, like this one from PetFusion, bring the joy of bird-watching to a wider audience—including those with limited mobility. Even your favorite feline can get in on the bird-peeping action from a place where both are protected and safe, Dr. Varble notes.\n\nAdditional ways to feed birds include:\n\nScattering the food on the ground\n\nSetting out treats on a platform\n\nProviding bird-friendly plants that produce seeds, berries, and nectar\n\nHanging food items (often filled with suet) from mesh bags or halved oranges stuffed with suet\n\nTips for Feeding Wild Birds\n\nNow that you know what birds eat and different ways to get food to them, let’s go over some pro bird-feeding tips.\n\n1Hang an Array of Feeders\n\nTo attract a variety of birds to your backyard, hang an array of feeders. Experts say providing only one type of feeder means you’ll get only a small group of the native species that’s visiting.\n\nDifferent species vary in whether they prefer platform feeders, trough feeders, suet feeders, hummingbird feeders, or sack feeders, so it’s important to have the right kind of feeder to attract the birds you are interested in seeing.\n\nFurther, separating your foods and/or seeds among your feeders keeps things organized and can aid in swifter feeding.\n\n3Take Feeders Down as Necessary\n\nIf there’s a particularly infectious disease going around your region, you may want to skip filling the feeder altogether or take it down for a period until the disease has dissipated.\n\nIf you choose to feed seeds, fruit, or suet to birds, know that it might get wet. If left in a soggy state for too long, things will start to grow on it. For example, sunflower seeds can sprout if you wait too long to clean them out after a heavy rain.\n\nMold can grow on any food, so be vigilant about cleaning your feeders, as not only can moldy food harm birds, it may also deter them from feeding.\n\n4Consider Feeder Placement\n\nTo help keep wild birds safe as they eat, think through the placement of your feeders. For instance, keeping feeders in areas with less dense vegetation and that are more visible can be ideal, as it’s not only easier for you to see the birds you are attracting, but it also prevents predators from having places to hide near feeding stations.\n\nAnd naturally, be cautious if you happen to keep feeders near windows. If a feeding station is near a window, it can result in an occasional window strike. You can prevent these collisions by putting up UV-reflective window clings (a type of decal or sticker that is visible to birds but less so to humans) on the closest window to the feeder so birds can spot the window.\n\nIn general, keep feeders within 3 feet of a window to decrease the possibility of serious injury, or beyond 12 feet, where the bird is less likely to strike the window at all.\n\n5Keep Domestic Cats Indoors\n\nYour sweet feline may enjoy an al fresco sunbathing, but they are a hazard to birds and can even deter them. “Cats are a major predator of the songbirds we try to attract with our feeders, and we want to keep our songbird population healthy and thriving as well as keep our domestic cats safe and secure,” Dr. Varble says.\n\n6Add a Bird Bath\n\nIn addition to your feeders, maintain a bird bath or two in the area. Birds need to get hydrated, and they’ll need water to wash down all that delicious food you’re feeding them! Keep an eye on bird baths to see if they evaporate—otherwise, change any standing water every other day.\n\nBirds deserve diverse, nutritious diets, just like us. Think of the joy you’ll give them when they score a strawberry or snatch up a mealworm! As with any animal, however, be extra cautious with wild birds, keeping a distance while you view them and maintaining your feeders so they’re eating in a clean environment.\n\nBe sure to stay educated and read up on foods that can be harmful or poisonous to pet birds, and the top things that birds find frightening.\n\nExpert input for this story provided by Dana Varble, DVM, CAE, chief veterinary officer with the North American Veterinary Community (NAVC), a nationwide veterinarians’ organization; Stephanie Lamb, DVM, DABVP (avian practice), co-owner of Arizona Exotic Animal Hospital in Mesa, Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona; John A.

With this move I was worried about my fur babies being taken care of, well I was worried for no reason! CHEWY has not missed a beat, keeping up with the move and the Auto-ship orders!

It’s ridiculous to have us waste our time shopping around for items just to realize we wasted our time when all items don’t even count for the discount. The correct headline ad should read “$30 e-gift card when you spend $100 on CERTAIN ITEMS” or at least include “exclusions apply” in the headline and not only when you click on it.

It was genuinely one of my favorite apps. Even if things were available on Amazon or at the pet store I would choose to order them on Chewy instead. But now the app won’t even work for me. I can browse and search for stuff, but as soon as I open my cart it says “error 503” so I’m unable to order anything. I tried a live chat to ask what I should do about the issue and it connected me with a Tiana B who was extremely rude. Then I found there was a phone number I could call. So I called the number, explained the issue and the man said he would send a message to their IT department to get the issue resolved which he said would take 24-48 hours. This has been going on for about 2 weeks now and it’s extremely frustrating because there are things I need to order for my dogs and it seems as though nobody is doing anything to try to resolve the issue and I’m at a loss. I don’t know what to do anymore, I might just have to uninstall the app if it won’t even work. And yes my app is updated, and no there is nothing wrong with my phone.",

Also, I am thankful for the convenience they provide to people who might not have the time or means to physically shop in a local store. Thank you, to the entire Chewy Team.🥰",

My auto ship was December 31, 2024, it’s still not here. Nor is the replacement bag Chewy sent to my house because even with loads of evidence that FedEx has been doing a TERRIBLE job of delivering my dog food, Chewy still sent a replacement via FedEx. Finally I had the idea to have a bag sent to a different location, where I would pick it up. So they have successfully sent two bags of food to a location for me to pick up via FedEx, but the packages to my house have been ‘out for delivery’ so many days im about to block chewy emails because I get them every day that FedEx lied and says it’s out for delivery again only for FedEx to not show up and then put in the system that I requested a future delivery date, which is also a lie. Chewy knows this, knows I now have to drive an hour to pick up food that I buy because it is supposed to be conveniently left at my door. I am so done with Chewy. I’ve talked to so many people that work there and only one ever followed up. Chewy’s script they give their employees is full of warm words, but warm words don’t give my dogs warm, full, tummies. I guess Chewy is finally like every other big company, people like me are ‘built in loss’ thats expected, what do they care, Chewy will still make loads of money this year.

My auto ship was December 31, 2024, it’s still not here. Nor is the replacement bag Chewy sent to my house because even with loads of evidence that FedEx has been doing a TERRIBLE job of delivering my dog food, Chewy still sent a replacement via FedEx. Finally I had the idea to have a bag sent to a different location, where I would pick it up. So they have successfully sent two bags of food to a location for me to pick up via FedEx, but the packages to my house have been ‘out for delivery’ so many days im about to block chewy emails because I get them every day that FedEx lied and says it’s out for delivery again only for FedEx to not show up and then put in the system that I requested a future delivery date, which is also a lie. Chewy knows this, knows I now have to drive an hour to pick up food that I buy because it is supposed to be conveniently left at my door. I am so done with Chewy. I’ve talked to so many people that work there and only one ever followed up. Chewy’s script they give their employees is full of warm words, but warm words don’t give my dogs warm, full, tummies. I guess Chewy is finally like every other big company, people like me are ‘built in loss’ thats expected, what do they care, Chewy will still make loads of money this year.

      "# Post ID 1cbzc1f: Alternatives to Chewy? with +51 score by [(cinnderly, Reddit, 2024-04-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/1cbzc1f/alternatives_to_chewy/)\nThis isn't about price. In February a Chewy box that was delivered had a shard of glass under the label that punctured my finger deeply. It had to be glued closed, ended up getting infected and needing more treatment, and because I'm a massage therapist I was out of work for a week. After going back and forth with them for a while they simply stated \"we won't be doing anything for you\". Like not even a coupon or something?? It was a freak situation, and I know it's not their negligence necessarily... But it left a bad taste in my mouth and I just don't want to give them my money anymore. Any suggestions are much appreciated, thanks. 🙏\n\n\nETA: I shouldn't be surprised I suppose, but the amount of people who are pissed about this post (why?) and are now looking through my comment history is kind of wild. Even pulling quotes. You guys should take a break, Reddit must be raising your blood pressure and I worry for your health. (Though at least one of them is someone I know in real life that for some reason loves to reply to me on Reddit with new accounts to say mean shit.) \n\nNote to self: don't ask for help on Reddit. Sheesh.\n\nAll of the costumer service reps I spoke with over the course of several weeks -- who contacted ME by the way -- were absolutely lovely. It was the big kahuna at the end who first wanted me to send him ask my info, then called back two minutes later to say flatly that they would not be doing anything. I did feel a little guilty asking for help but big companies have insurance and what if it was a kid that got cut? This incident was not my fault, and my finger still feels like there's something in it. Nothing in my order was glass. I can't say I trust corporations much anyway, but yes, Chewy seems to be one of the nicer ones. I just don't feel good about giving them my money anymore, what can I say?\n\nThank you very much to the MANY more people here who have been so kind and helpful. I appreciate your time, and your suggestions. 🙏\n\n## Comment ID l13rh4y with +54 score by [(Benicetome23, Reddit, 2024-04-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/1cbzc1f/alternatives_to_chewy/l13rh4y/) (in reply to ID 1cbzc1f):\nIm surprised.

In fact, I had called them first then realized I should have called FedEx and ended the call. They emailed me to find out what happened, which is why I was in touch with them. It was someone higher up who at first asked me to email him the pictures, the police report, the hospital papers etc. Then he called me back about 2 minutes later to tell me that I shouldn't bother, they will not be doing anything for me.\n\n#### Comment ID l13xlew with +18 score by [(nevermindjerk, Reddit, 2024-04-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/1cbzc1f/alternatives_to_chewy/l13xlew/) (in reply to ID l13sjt5):\nIf you have all of this, you should 100% file a claim against them. You may need an attorney in order to be successful in doing so, but this claim would be paid out and you'd be compensated for at least the hospital bills. Their insurance may subrograte to FedEx, but that's for them to handle and determine who is ultimately the at fault party.\n\n#### Comment ID l13swa1 with +9 score by [(Benicetome23, Reddit, 2024-04-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/1cbzc1f/alternatives_to_chewy/l13swa1/) (in reply to ID l13sjt5):\nJeez i would have thought they would have given you a credit or something.

It sucks! \n\nI am not trying to change your mind on finding a new supplier, I imagine that even Chewy would prefer you do so as they probably see you as a liability to them.  But I am surprised that it isn't incredibly obvious to you and everyone why Chewy wouldn't do anything for you. \n\nChewy could not give you so much as a coupon because in a legal situation a lawyer would absolutely try to argue that their doing so was an admittance of guilt.  The fact that you called a lawyer is proof that they were right to not give you anything. There is no likely way to prove where the glass came from or even if that is where your cut came from; pictures wouldn't be enough. It could, for example, be argued that you could have cut yourself on a tool you used to open the package or on other broken glass in your home. Even if under the label, glass could've worked its way there in shipping and also packages often have to be re-labeled during shipping. If you'd have injured yourself in an actual store, there are security cameras and witnesses and such that would make fault much easier to prove. Chewy would have to be incredibly foolish to take any accountability for something that can't likely be proven. Just as it is your responsibility to look out for your best interests, it is their responsibility to look out for their best interests. I am not trying to defend them here, just offering an explanation as to why you got nothing from them.\n\n## Comment ID l12jch8 with +4 score by [(SlitheringFlower, Reddit, 2024-04-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/1cbzc1f/alternatives_to_chewy/l12jch8/) (in reply to ID 1cbzc1f):\nI'm so sorry this happened to you and am disappointed chewy didn't do more! \n\nTractor supply co. has an eclectic assortment of pet supplies.

But feel free to delete if this is really the wrong place!)\n\nBased on my two recent experiences, I’m convinced this is the best company out there and I’d love to hear more good tales about them just to keep my good faith. \n\nI recently ordered the wrong type of leash for my dog. Asked about a return/exchange. They said, “we’ll refund you, but don’t worry about returning it. Just donate it to a local shelter or rescue!”\n\nAmazing! I will!\n\nThen I ordered the right type of leash and then accidentally sent me two. So I send a message saying “it’s no skin off my back since I didn’t pay for two, but if you want it back I’ll send it back.” And they were like “oops! Accidents happen. Go ahead and donate it to a shelter or rescue.”\n\nLike, I’m sure they get some sort of write off for this. And both leashes together were not even $35 they lost. But how often does this happen? Do the little things adding up not make as big of a dent in their profits as it’s worth? They could easily ask for these things back and keep their stock up so they can resell them. But they’re choosing to let me donate them instead?\n\nSeems like a really good company and it makes me feel better about ordering from them instead of shopping at my local pet store, which didn’t carry the leash I needed anyway, but I felt bad nonetheless.\n\n\n\n## Comment ID hui0bdr with +52 score by [(rike103, Reddit, 2022-01-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/sea3aa/anyone_have_a_good_experience_with_chewy/hui0bdr/) (in reply to ID sea3aa):\nChewy is awsome they messed up on my order the first time and made it up by not only giving me an extra bag of food but they threw in some treats,they occasionally throw free stuff with my orders\n\n## Comment ID hui18i1 with +66 score by [(atlantisgate, Reddit, 2022-01-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/sea3aa/anyone_have_a_good_experience_with_chewy/hui18i1/) (in reply to ID sea3aa):\nI appreciate that they are willing to do stuff like this, and I do order from them pretty often as a result. There have been a few orders here and there over the years that have had damaged product, or just little stuff like that that happens, and they are always hassle free for me to deal with when that crops up.\n\nI also have to shout out their fast shipping, especially as a car-free human. It's really great to have stuff I need get here fast when since not that easy for me to run out and pick something up.\n\nOn the other hand, I know they undercut vet's offices in drug pricing on purpose, and it's to their benefit to write off a $10 leash if they get a customer who will always get expensive prescriptions from them.\n\nThey can be a real pain in the ass with prescription information with vet offices. I once had trouble getting something filled, and my vet told me multiple times they HAD faxed the paperwork to Chewy, but Chewy kept telling me they needed my vet to respond; My vet showed me the logs and they absolutely were in the right. Lots of vets struggle with them.\n\nSo yes! In many ways a great company, especially for consumers. But also, no point in losing sight of the fact that they're still a giant company who can really give small businesses/clinics a headache!\n\n### Comment ID huk2n9q with +26 score by [(InvalidUserNemo, Reddit, 2022-01-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/sea3aa/anyone_have_a_good_experience_with_chewy/huk2n9q/) (in reply to ID hui18i1):\nJumping on the top comment.

The next day I got the most gorgeous bouquet of flowers and a sympathy card.  \n\nI have a friend whose shipment got delayed in shipping.  She contacted them about it. They refunded her money so she could get something locally while she waited for her shipment to arrive.  \n\nI see other comments that the pharmacy side has problems, but I haven’t encountered that yet, and my vet tells me to get some of our meds through them, so they don’t seem to be having trouble yet.  \n\nThat said, I still go to local small shops for treats and toys and stuff like that.

I chatted with a Chewy customer service rep and explained to them that we needed to cancel our order because it turned out it was not what we thought it was and our dog needed surgery. The rep was super kind and sweet, and canceled our order no issue.\n\nProbably three days after that, we got a flower delivery.

My wife and I are adopting a dog on Saturday. In preparation for our dog we shopped around to see which store would be cheapest for supplies. Between Amazon, Petsmart, Petco, and Chewy, Chewy was the cheapest by far, and had great reviews for their in house label. We ordered about $300 dollars worth of supplies. The shipment came in 4 different boxes. During shipment FedEx tracking noted 1 box was damaged. The bottle of urine cleaner had leaked or broken. We could tell because FedEx repackaged it and the cleaner was missing. Without us contacting Chewy support, Chewy resent the whole order. Not just the urine cleaner. We are talking $300dollars worth of stuff. I contacted support and informed them that all items were fine and we only needed the cleaner.

I haven’t received one, but that is sweet.\n\n## Comment ID huj7jst with +2 score by [(SharpEyeProductions, Reddit, 2022-01-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/sea3aa/anyone_have_a_good_experience_with_chewy/huj7jst/) (in reply to ID sea3aa):\nThe company I have zero experience with.

Plus you need people to restock and make sure it’s still in perfect new condition. And if it’s not (which often times it probably isn’t) they probably just through it away. Nice of them to suggest donating it, but it’s just a money thing. Amazon does the same thing with cheaper purchases\n\n## Comment ID hujt44o with +2 score by [(baconelk, Reddit, 2022-01-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/sea3aa/anyone_have_a_good_experience_with_chewy/hujt44o/) (in reply to ID sea3aa):\nThey sent me a birthday card for my dead dog, even though I had removed him from my account two months previous with a note that he died.

They said it wasn’t worth it cause she’s the only one in the area that would need that medication and we “should just give up already,” it is actually really easy to treat, relatively common, but most importantly she’s made a complete recovery. That’s thanks to chewy, we get the meds from them and she’s ten now, we didn’t think she’d make it to eight.\n\n## Comment ID huk754i with +1 score by [(Arklytte, Reddit, 2022-01-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/sea3aa/anyone_have_a_good_experience_with_chewy/huk754i/) (in reply to ID sea3aa):\nLove Chewy!

They were cheaper then my in city options it was easy to get my dogs meds. And if they ever messed up (only happened 2 times in 3 years ) they always refunded me or resent my item with a added bag of treats or something extra. When my dog had an allergic reaction to a can food id bought my girlfriend insisted I contact them to send the remaining cans back since he’d only eaten one can and their website says you can return if you’re unsatisfied. They sent me another flavor free of charge of the same brand an encouraged me to donate the remaining unopened cans to a shelter. They even added a little note for my dog saying they hoped he was feeling better and “ready to eat”\n\nAlso I don’t think it counts towards their tax since the donation isn’t coming from them . It’s coming from you to your shelter or rescue and not directly from their company. But I could be wrong. \n\nI genuinely think they are just a good company built but pet people for pet people.

      "# Post ID ggdkrq: I'm a Vet. Here's why I hate Chewy. [discussion] with +3144 score by [(PrinceofPersians, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/)\nNo, it's not the revenue loss.  Pretty much every vet who's not on the brink of retirement age has accepted the loss of the in-clinic pharmacy as an inevitability.  This post also isn't about online pharmacies in general.  I don't necessarily *like* Walmart, or 1-800-PETMEDS, or Allivet.  However, I *hate* Chewy.\n\nMy problem is the dishonesty.  You ever get one of those emails or calls where they say your vet hasn't approved the prescription?  Our clients sure did too.  In fact, Chewy accidentally sent us an email recently that was meant for clients:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Dear Pet Parent,  \n>  \n>Chewy is committed to your pet's health and happiness. Challenging times like these will never change that.  \n>  \n>We are actively working to contact your veterinarian to get your pet’s prescription approved, so we can deliver your pet’s essential medicine as fast as possible. Unfortunately, we haven't been able to get through as of yet.  \n>  \n>These are unprecedented times and it may be possible that your vet is extra busy or working reduced hours. If you’d like to help, you can also contact your veterinarian’s office to find out where they are with approvals.  \n>  \n>Your pet's well-being will always be our top priority and we’re doing everything we can to make sure your order goes through.  \n>  \n>We appreciate your support. Stay well and find moments of comfort with your pet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"We're working oh so hard on getting the prescription to you, if only your vet would approve it!\"\n\nWhat we found from several of our clients: on numerous occasions (or perhaps all), they were sending this email out the *second* they actually sent the email requesting approval from your vet.  Our clinic always printed out and took care of all approvals by noon the day the prescription requests came in.   Yet, we had always dealt with clients angry about how we weren't approving their scripts.  We would have to send approvals multiple times.  In fact we eventually had to disconnect our fax simply because sending Chewy scripts 3-4 times for each request clogged a free phone line and took up a lot of time.   Chewy tended to be the most egregious of the companies to do this.\n\nSo instead we stuck with emails which have convenient time stamps...and the ability to bcc them to the client :)\n\nSuddenly, when we started sending these emails to the client with a time stamp from both Chewy's email and our approval, they were calling Chewy instead of us to complain, yelling at customer service when they tried to call the client and claim we weren't approving it, or ditching Chewy altogether.  We got to see both sides ourselves too.  On one fun occasion, we didn't have a medication that our tech needed for her dog but could only order a 1000 count bottle, so she ordered from Chewy.  They didn't respond for about 5 days, then sent the first and only email approval to us at 5pm on a Saturday and then the email to our technician that they were unable to reach us after three attempts at about 7am the following morning.\n\nThen the demands came from Chewy for either verbal approval (no paper trail, and no accountability for them), or fax (a paper trail but difficult to send/prove to client, so in most cases, still no accountability for them).  On one occasion we denied both and told them via phone to email three times over the span of an hour, admittedly with some rudeness on the third, and they proceeded to try to send a fax through our phone line consecutively for 35 minutes straight.  I was doing an emergency surgery on a dog with a wound with a bad bleeder from the linguofacial vein while this was happening.  Needless to say, it was hard to concentrate on saving the patient but we couldn't disconnect the phone line in case another urgent call needed to be answered.  The dog did fine (for anyone worrying about this) :).\n\nAll of the dishonesty with the timing of approvals have been worse recently.  I suspect related to difficulty with supply in the COVID-19 crisis.  It's been tough for us too, and we've been honest with clients about this.  So with Chewy, I suspect that instead of saying \"we're having shipping delays\" or \"we're on backorder for that very common thing\", they're simply claiming the vet isn't responding while they deal with delayed arrivals/shipments.\n\nSo now they've stopped doing emails altogether.  They can do fax or verbal approval (again, no accountability), or a new option.  They have an online platform called Petscriptions (again from what their own customer service implied, communication on the timing of prescriptions had no accountability for them, they can say whatever they want).  Furthermore, with yours and our data becoming a more valuable resource, I don't want to make the data mining that every online company does even easier for them.\n\nI'm not writing this for the revenue.  You've all heard the \"shop local\" argument so many times I'd be beating a dead horse by saying it.  Money is tight, especially now.  And if you wanted to order online to save some money, I encourage you to do so.  I'm writing this because Chewy has peddled the idea that they genuinely *care* about your pets, through those occasional oil paintings from someone you and your dog have never met, to the kindhearted condolence texts that, when you read them with an objective eye, seem suspiciously formulaic, to the \"customer is always right\" level of pandering that you and I both know is harmful.  However, the stuff I described above is how they behave when dealing with a vital step in getting your pet the medication they need.  Given that this is one of those steps that you can't see, I think it's telling of how much they *actually* care about your pet.\n\nIt shouldn't need to be said that a corporation doesn't care about you or your fur-buddy, but here it is.  I only say this because there *are* people who care about your pet: you, your family, your neighbors (well, sometimes).   And yes, also your doggy daycare workers, your groomers, every worker at your vets office.  If we didn't care about your pet, we wouldn't have accepted far less money for the same work that human equivalents would make in all aspects.  So please, reserve your trust for the people who have actually tried to earn it, and don't let a group of people you've never met put a wedge between you.\n\nPeace, love, wags, and purrs,\n\nA pissed-off dogtor\n\ntl;dr: Chewy is a dishonest trainwreck that doesn't care about you or your pet any more than the other corporate online pharmacies (perhaps even less).\n\nEDIT: I'm sorry about not replying so long.  I work half days on Saturday and didn't feel right messing around on Reddit on shift.  A few things to add or discuss since I probably won't be able to reply to everything.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*FIRST AND FOREMOST\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*:  I got a message from a previous Chewy employee who will remain anonymous due to what you can see in the post:\n\n>Hey there! I worked for said company mentioned earlier (signed a kind of NDA) and I want you to know that you're right. I worked in customer service for almost a year before moving up, and I have to say that the company is BS. There was no communication between locations, and the longer we went on, the more people straight up ignored any communication without getting reprimanded.  \n>  \n>I hated working with vets, although I'm studying to be one, and I felt like crap after getting off the phone. Sometimes there would be a case floating around for a week, and no one cared to look at the \"email only\" notes or \"please call after faxing\"... It was embarrassing.  \n>  \n>I worked in the QA department for a while, but left after they refused to give me a raise, although I was the only person in the department with a degree and the knowledge of small animals,. exotics, and farm to keep the department going. No regrets. Terrible place for a person with an IQ over 35.  \n>  \n>Please don't share my name 😊\n\nI really appreciated that and just want to say that if this user stuck through all that (including some angry vets and techs and receptionists which I can sometimes be myself) then they've got the kind of tough our profession needs now more than ever :)\n\nSECOND:  Some people have brought up that their vet recommends Chewy or that their vet says they've never had a problem with them.  This may be true.  I do not know how the company works.  Perhaps its regional, perhaps its random.  But given that there is an employee here saying otherwise and numerous people in veterinary and human medicine confirming that this is a shared experience, I think it's safe to say that this is a widespread problem.  Furthermore, one should keep in mind that Chewy is owned by Petsmart, and Petsmart is in a partnership with Banfield.  I should also say that I don't know the status but I remember a previous attempt of a Banfield merger with Blue Pearl and VCA.  So the point here is that I wouldn't be surprised if some vets aren't allowed to bash Chewy or perhaps get financial incentive to send clients there specifically.   Or perhaps Chewy simply does better dealing with the clinics under their own umbrella.  Or it's nothing but coincidence, I'm a vet not a psychic.\n\nTHIRD: Yes, they have great customer service when speaking with you.  The point of this post is to discuss what happens to people who aren't the client and what happens to your prescriptions--that your pet needs--behind the scenes.\n\nI'll edit more as needed or try to respond better to comments individually but there are a lot more than I anticipated o\\_O\n\nBasically, just be wary of any company where you'll never be able to chat with the boss (and also be wary of that boss if you can chat with them).  For example, I hear Jeff Bezos is building an actual giant clock that's totally not a doomsday device in the middle of his desert mountain.  Anyways, please be safe, keep 6 feet distance from any of those gross \"other people\", and stay fuzzy, soldiers.\n\nEdit 2: I spelled bad :(\n\nEdit 3: We've got another employee.  Thank you very much  PoodlePopXX\n\n>As some one who worked for Chewy, they are an actual trash company. They treat their employee like garbage and they run unsafe warehouses. Everything and everyone is a number to them no matter who hard you work. Their attendance policy is a joke and is meant to push people out as quickly as they come in.  \n>  \n>Just one example, one night an industrial lithium battery exploded and caught fire. A good portion of the warehouse filled with dark black smoke that smelled terrible. People passed out, others couldn’t breath, and they didn’t want to open the doors or let people go outside and stop working for fresh air. The entire warehouse needed to keep working. People had headaches all night. Three people ended up hospitalized. They had to call ambulances.

There were days we fielded more calls from Chewy reps than clients looking for verbal approval on scripts they claim they had sent yet never did. Or angry clients claiming Chewy had told them they sent the request days ago and we never responded. It was infuriating! Our solution was to make Chewy resend the email or fax and never give verbal approval so we had a paper trail. It wasn't a perfect system but it helped.\n\n### Comment ID fq0dayl with +189 score by [(SoDakTex91, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq0dayl/) (in reply to ID fq09ei4):\nI’m also a vet receptionist! I’ve been in the industry almost 8 years now and it’s always been this way with chewy! I had a client order meds for 4 pets and chewy only sent the request for 2. Owner calls us yelling about how he paid for 4 exams for his dogs to get this done and we wouldn’t approve it correctly. I got into our system where we scan in and time stamp the approvals and could tell him that we had only received 2 and sent them back on such and such date and such and such time. He calmed down with me and than called chewy and yelled at them haha\n\n#### Comment ID fq0nx8k with +102 score by [(hitzchicky, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq0nx8k/) (in reply to ID fq0dayl):\nI'll never understand why people start a conversation with yelling.

Chewy and others have had issues with counterfeit product.\n\nChewy is known for fantastic customer service and that’s awesome!  However, please understand that vets have an ENTIRELY different experience with them.  We do not mind helping you get product at a lower cost because our primary goal is to keep your pets healthy!  I much rather your pet not get Lyme disease than sell you flea and tick product.\n\nJust know, it costs us time, money and frustration to have to deal with these pharmacies who are frequently hostile toward us.  It is a love/hate relationship.\n\nWe have to divert man power to lose money to pharmacies which is okay if it helps our patients. Fulfilling one script can take our techs up to 15 minutes as techs have to find the chart, ensure the medication is acceptable by checking the medical history, contact the owners (who usually don’t answer) to triple check that they have been on it for things such as heartworm, and then chase down a doctor to sign (usually with a patient). Once the vet has it, we have to review everything from medical history to dosage, and sign off.  Then it goes back to the tech who must send it off.  This occurs all while both the tech and doctor are seeing patients, performing surgeries, reviewing cases and performing our other job duties.  We do about 35 of these a day.  But I repeat, we will do it as long as you keep your pets on the medications they need!\n\nAlso, majority of us are not trying to rip you off.  Our prices are higher because we stock lesser quantities!  Always ask about rebates!\n\nOh god, this turned into a rant.

I most certainly don't think my smaller vet clinic didn't approve it, they probably didn't see it yet or, perhaps they only approve things a certain time every day, so it can take longer then expected.  If I have an emergency type script, I'm not using chewy, as you can never get a large company to move their ass in matters that only are important to you. But you'll always have a better response from your vet. Even if I have to call my vet later, I'm assuming something was missed (on either side) and now that they're expecting it, after I call chewy, it should be fine. Of course, I worked in a Drs office for about 5 years, many years ago, so maybe that's why I'm not freaking out about these things.  Honestly, I expect to have these issues with Any company I might use for my pet's rx, as the company is only as good as the underpaid person requesting the approval. I also feel clear communication from the vet or staff can change the dialogue here.  Something like \"We'll get to the bottom of this, but I do want to let you know we've been having some problems with Chewy saying they did things that they didn't\".  It's not like you have to protect Chewy when they mess up.  I really hope you do tell your clients about these issues each time.  Chewy asks for feedback all the time, and if people were aware and reported these issues it's possible Chewy might get their head out of their ass.\n\n### Comment ID fq0wj5h with +7 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq0wj5h/) (in reply to ID fq0pxxg):\nI'm the same tbh.

They recommended trying 1-800 PET MEDS or Chewy as an option, so I went with Chewy since we already got kitty litter through them. \n\nCouple of things that went through my mind:\n\n1. I wish the vet office had told us they were no longer carrying the med BEFORE we were about to run out. Luckily with COVID, I was trying to stay a week ahead of things but normally I’d wait till a day before they’d run out. (This is more of a personal complaint than a Chewy complaint). But, I ordered ASAP and there was no lapse in medicine for the pup. \n\n2. I’d heard this about Chewy from friends who are vets. Also that the drugs aren’t “guaranteed” like they are at a vet’s office. That’s not the best word, but the best my brain could come up with. If the medicine doesn’t work/makes your pet sick,/etc., Chewy can’t/won’t do anything to right the wrong, whereas your vets office might. \n\n3. I went with Chewy because of ease, I already had an account with them. But I can change if it’s not the best option.\n\nVet workers of the world, knowing my vet’s office simply doesn’t carry the med anymore- would you recommend I reorder through 1-800 PET MEDS over Chewy?

They get an insane bulk discount. Vets don’t always carry the massive size bags because they will expire before they can sell them. If you ask reception at your vet office to special order you a specific size of food they 100% will. If it’s not a size they normally carry you can ask the office manger how much it would be before you place the order since they probably haven’t done the math on the price vs order price yet. \nThey just need a heads up cause every vet I’ve ever worked for has to place one big order at a time to get the free shipping so they wait until they have a order together.  \n\nAlso for pet parents starting a new prescription food a lot of people like to buy the small bags Incase the animal hates it. Also vets will fully 100% refund the price of the bag of food if you cat or dog refuses it. We can return the open bag of food to manufacture and get refunded. Win/win. Half the companies require us to send the food back the other half of companies don’t and we usually give those open bags of food away to clients who literally can’t afford anything.

Thanks for taking the time to share it. \n\nI have a great relationship with our vet—we’ve used them for over twenty years, through four dogs, three cats, a turtle and a snake; two dogs, two cats and turtle currently. Just a few years ago our oldest dog got a terrible infection that required several expensive meds and when the doc brought the ‘scrip out he said flat out to me that I could get it cheaper at the Walgreens down the street. I asked him what numbers we’re talking about and it was hundreds. \n\nThat kind of behavior between vets and patients builds trust and is one of the reasons I’ve been with my vets for over two decades. There’s also the great care and friendly staff. \n\nAnyway, what kind of chronic illnesses are animals dealing with that multiple animal pharmaceutical companies are required? Or are pets being over medicated? I’ve had nine animals over the past ~30 years, I get some animals have chronic conditions. What we’ve needed for our animals was reasonably priced at our vet or we found it at regular drugstores at a cheaper price. I also know my vet practice’s philosophy is low key and they have advised against medications for my animals—kitty Prozac for a particularly odd cat we have now. Understandably, that’s not a lot of evidence from which to extrapolate a cogent opinion on the issue, I just don’t get that kind of market for medications for pets.\n\n### Comment ID fq0bxhu with +13 score by [(Emulocks, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq0bxhu/) (in reply to ID fq060to):\nAccording to this website:\n https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-pet-statistics\n\nthere are almost 103 million cats and dogs owned as pets in the US.

They treat their employee like garbage and they run unsafe warehouses. Everything and everyone is a number to them no matter who hard you work. Their attendance policy is a joke and is meant to push people out as quickly as they come in. \n\nJust one example, one night an industrial lithium battery exploded and caught fire. A good portion of the warehouse filled with dark black smoke that smelled terrible. People passed out, others couldn’t breath, and they didn’t want to open the doors or let people go outside and stop working for fresh air. The entire warehouse needed to keep working. People had headaches all night. Three people ended up hospitalized. They had to call ambulances. If you felt awful from the smoke inhalation and air quality you could choose to go home, but you’d have to take attendance points against your record. That’s the kind of company they are.\n\nI ordered from there often before I worked there.

Right in the heart of summer bugs. Sitting outside and watching the bugs bug our poor dog! Bought it local (from Vet) and it even smelled different. Buying local ever since.

Bathing can accelerate the medicine in the collar being released, and wear it out faster.\n\n#### Comment ID fq4vrk6 with +2 score by [(SlipperyNoodleWho, Reddit, 2020-05-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq4vrk6/) (in reply to ID fq0z2zq):\nExactly!

I used to be a vet tech, and Chewy were okay about prescriptions, I think, but I never dealt with that side of it in the office, so I'm not sure. Even though I no longer work with my former employer, I still always get my pets' pain meds, flea and tick medicine, heartworm prevention, etc. from my vet of 20+ years, so I haven't had to deal with Chewy on the pharmacy front. But with just regular packages...even before coronavirus and not ordering near holidays, they were *always* late coming to my door. This is even with me ordering over $50 on stuff, which is supposed to mean I would get 2-day shipping. Instead, I would get packages a week or so later. I wouldn't have been so upset if they didn't have *huge* banners all over their website that said free 2-day shipping for orders over $50 lmao whenever I ordered stuff below $50, it would take even longer.\n\nNeedless to say, I no longer shop with them. I got tired of emailing them to ask where my stuff was, especially if it was time-sensitive (not prescription meds, but things like dog food because I was running low and only had maybe 3 days left, or even cosequin tablets that needs to be taken every day to remain effective -- my dogs not having any for 4+ days resulted in pain for my poor seniors). Keep in mind that I'm also disabled, so my packages being late could *really* fuck things up, since I can't just hop in the car and go to a physical store to get the things I needed.\n\n## Comment ID fq0g1br with +6 score by [(ningirl42, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq0g1br/) (in reply to ID ggdkrq):\nThank you for this information.

I would just like to remind everyone that we customers were sold out by the owner for 3 billion dollars to Petsmart. That's why we all pay tax on the orders now too.\n\n## Comment ID fq2ud3v with +2 score by [(eh_throwaway98, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq2ud3v/) (in reply to ID ggdkrq):\nI’ve never heard anything good about chewy.

I’ve had trouble with Chewy from the get go just for fricking dog toys and the order being delayed for weeks.... and long before the current slow shipping pandemic situation.  My sister lives two hours south of me and she’s been a Chewy customer for a long time but recently gave up on them.  I’ve never gotten scripts for my critters from Chewy, Allivet is just a stone’s throw away so shipping has always been quite fast and they’re very good about getting approval WHEN their online selection of vets included our new doctor that is (had an issue with vet “not approving” the prescription....I sent an angry text to our vet but as it turns out, it was Allivet’s mistake because they’re system “reverted” to our former vet, who recently retired.  But we got it all straightened out and since (and long before) this situation, they’ve always done a great job.  I’ve never gotten vet meds from Walmart or any walk in pharmacy with the one exception of an eye “moisturizer” for my elderly basset hound, and the Walgreens pharmacist was kind enough to recommend an equally good but less expensive option.\n\nThat said, idk what’s been going on with Chewy but after my first experience I’ve been reluctant to ever order from them again, even like I said, for dog toys and an orthopedic pet bed....\n\nI know vets must be run off their feet right now and mine recently came to the house (but examined my pups in the garage, not inside) and I couldn’t believe she was kind enough to do this given the current social isolation scenario.  But I’m disabled and it’s very difficult to get 3 dogs in and out of the car (the largest of whom is 100+ pounds and has a deformed foot so jumping up is very painful) so her home visit was more appreciated than she’ll ever know.  I consider vets on the front line because even in quarantine, life for our critters goes on and they must be tended to like always....\n\nSo from the bottom of my heart, thank you for continuing to do your thing.....I for one (and I’m most definitely NOT alone) am forever grateful.\n\n### Comment ID fq33cwv with +1 score by [(PrinceofPersians, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq33cwv/) (in reply to ID fq31t94):\nThank you so much, that means a lot to us in general.

I’ve used them to get flea and tick meds with two different vets now and I’ve never gotten a message about vets approving slowly. The only time I got the message was last month when I ordered food and they were upfront from the start that it would take a lot longer than usual and even gave me the option to cancel the order, 24 hours after it was placed, and no hoops to jump through. I’ve asked to return a bed that was too big for my dog and they said to donate it, which was great since I volunteer at a shelter and also foster. They even sent my dog a hand written birthday card. These things are trivial in the grand scheme of things but for people thinking this is the normal and plan to never use Chewy, just have your own experience before you decide. If my vet can figure out how to autoship her meds in 2 days for a pretty big discounted price without me ever having to make a single phone call, then I’ll consider buying from them instead.\n\n## Comment ID fq0hakr with +4 score by [(wellfuckmylife666, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq0hakr/) (in reply to ID ggdkrq):\nLol I seriously don't trust corporations and I don't think anyone should.\n\n## Comment ID fq02sjz with +5 score by [(BetsMomE, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq02sjz/) (in reply to ID ggdkrq):\nThank you for sharing this.

As someone with stable finances who (normally) shops online somewhat frequently there is just no reason for my card to ever decline. Every time I go to Chewy’s site to manually get them to run it again, I don’t have to provide any additional information and it will immediately work. I have been surprised by how illogical it is for them to not just try to run the card again if there’s a processing issue/problem connecting with the bank. Reading this has admittedly made me somewhat suspicious that this is a tactic to delay order processing. \n\nTo be honest it won’t impact my use of the service for the time being - before we were unable to pick up prescription food from our dog’s dermatologist because of our hours v. theirs, and now because our local government has asked us to avoid going anywhere we have to drive + we’re minimizing contact with people. We may have to look into whether another site carries our dogs’ prescriptions though.

We’d risk being in trouble part way through the year if she has an accident and there’s not enough left in the pot. \n\nIf vets were charging something more reasonable I’d go back in a heartbeat.\n\n### Comment ID fq25qj3 with +2 score by [(PrinceofPersians, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq25qj3/) (in reply to ID fq0qcdx):\nI can tell you that part of this is related to cost to acquire the meds.  I do know for a fact that corporate clinics such as VCA can get medications at less than half the cost that I can simply by working out deals with the companies to buy in bulk for x-amount of time.

I worked there for 2.5 years in their main customer service location as a customer service representative.\n\nYou are absolutely right, the RX team is awful. As a rep, we all hated having to assist that team, and when they launched their pharmacy with actual meds instead of just prescription food, it was a literal shit-show. A lot of departments at Chewy are run by younger people with little experience, with most management being between 20 and 30. [I'm in this bracket, so I'm not saying this was a bad thing, just maybe needed a few seaaoned managers]\n\nThe approval process is so stupid. Customer places order, order gets sent to RX, RX automatically sends a fax (if there's a fax number on file) to the vet. Then it sits in a queue until a person gets to it to make the phone calls to the vet's office. Any emails sent are usually automatic based on time. There used to be email options for the vet diet foods, but with medication, legally it's not valid. The RX team was so small when I was there, and when an angry customer calls in, we would have to reach out to that team to inquire about the status of their order. We as reps couldn't get the approval ourselves (unless it was food) so we couldn't even call the vet for the customer.\n\nIf you ordered on a weekend? Forget it, you'll get a bunch of emails becuase most vets are closed.\n\nChewy was amazing when I started. Then Petsmart bought it, and the 2 guys that created Chewy and their original team got quietly pushed out one by one. I should have left when they did.\n\nI'm sorry for anyone who has had a bad experience with Chewy. I miss how it was, when my days were spent helping happy people and talking about their pets, instead of having to apologize for FedEx and Lasership.\n\n## Comment ID fq0tmj9 with +2 score by [(tabby51260, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq0tmj9/) (in reply to ID ggdkrq):\nI also hate Chewy - but for an entirely different reason.\n\nThe one and *only* time I've ever gotten a piece of mail from them was within a week of putting my dog down. \n\nFuck Chewy.\n\n### Comment ID fq0w5vw with +3 score by [(asilentmurder, Reddit, 2020-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fq0w5vw/) (in reply to ID fq0tmj9):\nDid Chewy know you lost your dog?

My dog is on special prescription food now, and my vet told me to either go through Chewy or a store like PetSmart because they were out of the food at their practice. I went through Chewy for the first order, and it was all approved by them and my vet within a few hours. However, I'm not surprised my vet recommended them since they're a very small practice and they tend to carry a limited supply of medicines and food.\n\nI'm wondering too if Chewy maybe prioritizes certain practices over others? Like, maybe ones they like are given priority and ones they don't are thrown in the \"if we're falling behind, send a notice that the vet is taking forever\" pile.\n\nOne thing I will say -- I don't understand anyone who would jump to calling up their vet angry about an email, fax, etc. miscommunication. It's your pet's doctor and they have their best interests at heart; I would never dream of being anything but polite calling into mine, even if I was frustrated.

They send 3 requests within a single day, claim they \"didn't get the fax\", and call for verbal confirmations before even giving us a full day to get back to them. Our vets get NO benefits to sending people to Chewy vs any other online pharmacy. In fact, we offer price matching to discourage it. And our vets are very open about the fact that Zoetis, Elanco, etc aren't going to warranty their products from them, but they will if they buy from us, regardless of the price.\n\n## Comment ID fqbqnmd with +1 score by [(idtlkpswds, Reddit, 2020-05-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fqbqnmd/) (in reply to ID ggdkrq):\nMy vet even told us to shop the meds.\n\n## Comment ID fqdqwej with +1 score by [(angelheaded--hipster, Reddit, 2020-05-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ggdkrq/im_a_vet_heres_why_i_hate_chewy_discussion/fqdqwej/) (in reply to ID ggdkrq):\nAs a senior dog rescuer with a bad back, chewy has saved me.

Everything looks good, but i wanted to see how they fare compared to Trupanion? I know they are backed by trupanion, however, what are the differences? I see they have an annual deductible and the complete plan covers exam visits, etc. and works with trupanion direct pay which is nice. My concern is do they also not increase premiums as pets age? Also, since it’s newer, I don’t have any concern about Chewy going under, but how likely would it be for CarePlus to go under or sell? Don’t want to be in a position where they cancel coverage and I can hypothetically be stuck with pre-existing conditions. Hoping since it would be backed by trupanion, they will still honor it. \n\n## Comment ID lcqdugo with +3 score by [(peachcobb, Reddit, 2024-07-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/petinsurancereviews/comments/1e0oo18/thoughts_on_chewy_careplus/lcqdugo/) (in reply to ID 1e0oo18):\nI have the chewy plus on my cats.

For example, I’m in CA and I can only purchase a Lemonade policy through Chewy. Other states you can only purchase a Trupanion policy, it’s very confusing. \n\nAs you’ve noted, the main difference is the annual deductible and exam fee coverage. Chewy also has the 24/7 vet line you can call to get help if needed. Going through Chewy does mean for prescriptions and prescription food they have you go through Chewy for full reimbursement. \n\nNow as to raising premiums, I can almost guarantee premiums are going to rise throughout the life of the policy. How much? I have no idea. Even if Chewy and Trupanion both swear up and down they don’t raise rates due to the aging of your pet, they will find other reasons including inflation, more people making more expensive claims, cost of doing business, etc etc. But that seems to be par for the course in insurance. My health insurance, car insurance, and so on have all risen steadily. Pet insurance is bound to do the same. \n\nIn my opinion you are taking a bit of a risk going through Chewy rather than Trupanion. Chewy has not been in the pet insurance game very long and so they don’t have that stability that others may have. They may decide they don’t like being in the pet insurance field, they may decide they don’t like the companies they are working with, and so on. It wasn’t long ago they only offered Trupanion, now they have Lemonade and Trupanion. What if tomorrow they drop one or the other? Or Lemonade or Trupanion decline to keep working with Chewy? That could leave you in a more precarious position. Basically you have a whole other company that is between you and your insurer. They can make decisions on your behalf that you may not like. \n\nBecause pet insurance isn’t heavily regulated, it can leave customers in the lurch, with pre existing conditions and so on, with no legal penalties. So it is worth thinking about, are the benefits of purchasing through Chewy worth the potential risk if they withdraw or change in the future? If Trupanion and Chewy part ways it will be entirely up to Trupanion to extend coverage to you. But they are under no obligation legally to cover what are now pre existing conditions. Will they? Unknown. \n\nGenerally it is advised to wait a minimum of 5 years for a new insurance company to ‘settle’ and make sure they are stable and able to service claims. Chewy is not offering it’s own policies, but I would still be skeptical of them until they get more time under their belt. They launched in 2022 I think and already made a significant change in CA, dropping Trupanion entirely. I don’t know what happened to people who had Trupanion through Chewy in CA.\n\n### Comment ID lcpiqtw with +2 score by [(MarillaV, Reddit, 2024-07-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/petinsurancereviews/comments/1e0oo18/thoughts_on_chewy_careplus/lcpiqtw/) (in reply to ID lcpgvof):\nOh and I forgot to say, you say moving your dogs to Chewy, so are they on another insurance plan right now? Before you move them I would double check for any pre existing concerns. Please please obtain your vet records and make sure nothing has been noted that you are unaware of, like tartar build up, itchy skin, watery eyes, etc. These can all be used to deny future claims. It’s worth a look! Even if you decide to move the dogs anyway, you won’t get a nasty surprise later.",
      "# Post ID tg0non: Chewy Hack with +46 score by [(figgyfern, Reddit, 2022-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/tg0non/chewy_hack/)\nHeads Up: My Chewy account was recently hacked. I don't often check it because I use auto-ship, but I noticed that somehow I was set to receive a package with a dog genetic test that cost $150...even though I don't own a dog. Then I realized this wasn't the first charge. Weirdly enough, whoever went in there didn't change the shipping address. Chewy is great and they refunded and canceled the shipments, but just a heads up their system clearly is not very secure. Bottom line, check your account more often, just in case!\n\n## Comment ID i0z62jl with +5 score by [(andrewphx, Reddit, 2022-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/tg0non/chewy_hack/i0z62jl/) (in reply to ID tg0non):\nThis happened to someone else on Chewy, recently too.

I investigated via my PayPal and discovered the authorized link section and Chewy was listed/there before the above convo.  This was denied as to what happened.

Now I'm concerned they were aware. I'm wondering if their site had a vulnerability, maybe a former IT employee or pen tester (they test sites for penetration vulnerability, can be hired or freelance going off bug bounties), even a hacker. \n\nWhen white hat (good guy) hackers find vulnerabilities, they'll report it to the site, sometimes they'll earn a \"bug bounty\", like 'hey I found this, your IT Dept should repair it, I just saved you $$$, pay me for it').  On the other hand, someone could have found it, reported it, it wasn't acknowledged the way they felt they deserved, and they reposted the vulnerability for others to expose. And then there are the hackers who don't even try to report it, they just try to sell the vulnerability.

Four random pet plushy toys were ordered and the order summary emailed to my wife, plus an earlier email noting that the account's email had been changed (to my wife's).\n\nThe fun wrinkle is: we do not have a Chewy account.\n\nBy studying the emails my wife got, and then calling Chewy customer service and talking to Noah, who was genuinely apologetic, I think the theory explained below (fraudulent seller working with compromised Chewy accounts) is maybe correct.\n\nSomeone's real Chewy account with a weak password becomes compromised by hacker.  Hacker changes the email address (and maybe shipping address) on the account, and then places orders for random stuff.  This is charged to the original account owner's PayPal / credit card.\n\nThe shipping address person is perhaps innocent, and the original account owner as well.\n\nBut what I'm unsure of is: I don't think Chewy supports 3rd party sellers (unlike Amazon).  So how does the hacker make $$$ out of this?\n\nSeparately, I noticed that the embedded links in the Chewy email do not use https, which is insecure.  Two strikes :)\n\n### Comment ID iq5swdy with +1 score by [(q_gurl, Reddit, 2022-09-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/tg0non/chewy_hack/iq5swdy/) (in reply to ID ibaobn8):\nThat is the theory I am going with also. I got a random bag of dogfood today and remembered reading something about a scam. I contacted Chewy. She found the order on someone else's account. She refunded them. I have never nor will I ever order dogfood from them. I buy at a feed store. I figure they are trying to see if it is noticed by the paying acct and if not then they will order for themselves (?). I don't know. I know I took all pymt methods off mine and changed my password.\n\n## Comment ID icb85qq with +2 score by [(caiteebird, Reddit, 2022-06-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/tg0non/chewy_hack/icb85qq/) (in reply to ID tg0non):\nEveryone who has had this happen (happened to me too), what did you do once it happened?\n\n### Comment ID icdctlo with +1 score by [(Smeegs3, Reddit, 2022-06-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/tg0non/chewy_hack/icdctlo/) (in reply to ID icb85qq):\n1. Call Chewy to report the fraud. They will cancel the order and reset the email/password for your account. \n2.

They placed two $45 orders for the same 2 Items (Treats + Dog Food) and shipped to separate addresses in Saint Joseph, MO and Belton, TX. They paid via PayPal.\n\nInterestingly, they put my street address in the first line of the addresses and the actual delivery address in line 2 as:\n\n        FirstName LastName\n        1234 My Street\n        5678 Fraud Address\n        Fraud City, AA 00000\n\nMy guess is that the people receiving the scam orders are mules who signed up for a work-from-home scam job and the fraudsters are using them to unknowingly receive and re-ship the orders to the actual fraudsters. It may be related to a shady site, but I don't think the scammers are straight drop shipping since so many people are having identical scam orders sent to different addresses.My Chewy password was an old weak one that I have mostly stopped using, so I'm sure it was in a previous data breach. They also changed the email and pw for my account, but I still got order confirmations from both Chewy and PayPal. Chewy customer support was great and canceled the orders. It seems weird that PayPal is the preferred payment method, my guess is that the backend fraud checks for separate billing/shipping addresses is weaker with PayPal than with the stored credit cards, so more fake orders are getting through when they use PayPal.\n\n### Comment ID ici93hh with +2 score by [(OkSheepherder6676, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/tg0non/chewy_hack/ici93hh/) (in reply to ID icdcbzk):\ncorrect. when orders are paid with paypal, we don’t receive any billing address info in our system. 9 times out of 10 it bypasses our fraud prevention system unless the hacker is using a VPN, among a few other factors\n\n### Comment ID idim29l with +2 score by [(softerthings, Reddit, 2022-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/tg0non/chewy_hack/idim29l/) (in reply to ID icdcbzk):\nI noticed the same address set up.

Got hacked around 2am CT a week ago; they placed 4 orders to different addresses (FL, CA, MI, and GA), each for 1-2 bags of dog food, using a credit card I had on file (and had recently used for an order). They kept my name for the shipping addresses, but changed the email and password to my account after the orders were placed so I couldn't log in.  Customer Service was super helpful and was able to cancel 3 of the orders; unfortunately one was literally being boxed and shipped as we were talking, so that one she refunded me and tried to put a cancel on the delivery.  I deleted payment methods and changed my password.  Interestingly, however, a week later I got two emails (within minutes of each other) telling me that my account had suspicious activity and they suspended my account, and I should call them to verify my account and get it reinstated.  I did that, and they were super efficient and friendly, but I have to wonder what kind of activity happened again?!?  I'm hoping it means they are putting in place more measures to detect when these asshats are trying to pull stunts.\n\n### Comment ID iclxlco with +2 score by [(OkSheepherder6676, Reddit, 2022-06-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/tg0non/chewy_hack/iclxlco/) (in reply to ID icltvtx):\nthose emails you received a week later were actually sent in error. we had a glitch with our anti-fraud system where it put a flag on random customer’s accounts or orders even tho their acct. has not been compromised. they are still having us tell customers to call in for account verification as a precautionary measure but the whole thing was a system error. they fixed it in like two days but it happened to a pretty large amount of customers.

You have to go into your PayPal and look to see if Chewy is listed there.   People pay bills with \"reoccurring payments\" and 2 factor doesn't seem to apply to retailers/sites that are listed.  Payments will sail through.  [https://www.paypal.com/c2/smarthelp/article/FAQ2254](https://www.paypal.com/c2/smarthelp/article/FAQ2254)\n\nI think that's what's going on with people here.  Somehow Bots/people are able to hack into Chewy accounts and then make orders via PayPal saved as a payment that sails through due to the site being preapproved.  I believe it's a Chewy site compromise (regardless of their denials).\n\n#### Comment ID i92c14p with +1 score by [(deepayes, Reddit, 2022-05-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/tg0non/chewy_hack/i92c14p/) (in reply to ID i91g6wr):\nThat's pretty much what I concluded too.

This happened to me this morning, followed by 1k spam messages sent to email inbox, presumably to hide the chewy orders.

I thought that odd and went back to bed.  In the morning I went to Safari and when I went to log into my Chewy account the username that came up in the Browser window defaulted to 'myusername.amzltd.net'.  I was completely freaked out by the thought that some hacker had broken into my computer and been able to do this.  Called Chewy straight away.  The order had already been placed for $44.30.  Chewy canceled the order.  I changed my password and then called Apple and spent a couple of hours going through my computer. All looked fine.  Installed Malwarebytes and did a complete scan.  All good.  However I still couldn't let go of this nagging feeling and came to Reddit.  I also googled this AMZ LTD company and there are a bunch of online sales companies that have no actual website but appear to be entities.  So incredibly annoying.

Received a confirmation email this afternoon for a Chewy order of 25 lb bag of dog food, but the person listed her name and address so it was easy to see it both a. was something I don’t normally order and b. to someone who lives across the US from me with a totally different name and not one of my previously used shipment locations. I immediately called Chewy customer service and the rep said the order was pending so she could quickly and easily cancel it and remove my payment information (I use a card not PayPal when making Chewy orders) then do a password reset. I was nervous this person took down my personal info but so far the only charge on my card is the pending Chewy one that should be gone in a couple days due to cancellation, so hopefully this person just tried for some free dog food that she’ll never receive on my dime. I was hoping she didn’t have my card or contact info just somehow access to my account, unfortunately! I’m grateful I didn’t have pushback from Chewy when I said I didn’t order this food, but maybe it’s because this is happening semi-regularly.\n\n## Comment ID i9hxkea with +1 score by [(nusscracker896, Reddit, 2022-05-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/tg0non/chewy_hack/i9hxkea/) (in reply to ID tg0non):\nSame thing happened to me a few weeks ago. 3 random orders all sent to random address around the United states and they turned on an old auto subscription that I had turned off.  \nChewy customer service was great and refunded me all the fradualant charges immediately.

Like others have said, inbox was filled with spam emails and I missed the receipt initially but caught the tracking.\n\nI'm going to echo what someone else said on this thread -- both those receiving the packages and those getting charged might be victims -- 3rd party sellers are somehow gaining access to Chewy accounts, pocketing the money for the items they're reselling, and charging the Chewy accounts full price.\n\n**Did anyone else recently purchase something from a 3rd party seller, on Amazon or elsewhere, and have this happen? A quick check of the seller now reveals similar issues with other people's products being \"stopped in transit and returned to seller\" which is exactly what's going to happen to the person who purchased the products charged to my Chewy account.**\n\n## Comment ID ib115ka with +1 score by [(jvjamie1994, Reddit, 2022-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/tg0non/chewy_hack/ib115ka/) (in reply to ID tg0non):\nJust happened to me as well...

They used to be an eBay seller but got a bunch of negative reviews for non-shipment, now they have a website that allows you to buy through them and then they purchase the products from other places and you pay them in payments. I’m really wondering if this isn’t the place that’s part of the scam of where the folks who are buying the items are shopping.

Chewy flagged my orders (which I legitimately placed) and I received an email saying \"please contact Customer Service regarding your recent order\".  I also believe this is an internal error with Chewy's order system.  It happened to me recently as well. About 2 weeks ago, I ordered my dog's prescription food, which she's been on for almost 3 years and I received the fraud email. The c/s rep said she would release the order, which she never did. I had to call two days later and then spoke to someone who in turn THEN released the order. I asked them \"why doesn't your Fraud Dept. look at the order? It's a product I always buy and the name/address and pet name are the same?  Then last night, I received an email from Chewy stating the flea/tick preventative I ordered was flagged for fraud. I called c/s and she said she would contact her supervisor and the fraud department, but the item won't ship until later in the week. \n\nI realize Chewy is trying to be proactive here, but something isn't adding up.

I tend to buy in bulk from whatever online retailer has the cheapest price so no loyalty to a specific service, but I’m slightly annoyed with pets at home after my last two orders\n\n## Comment ID jzsgqfy with +1 score by [(EvadeCapture, Reddit, 2023-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmericanExpatsUK/comments/169dme2/best_chewyonline_pet_supply_alternative/jzsgqfy/) (in reply to ID 169dme2):\nZooplus and viovet \n\nJust an FYI getting things like flea and wormers might have gotten a whole lot more complicated due to vet regulation changes requiring an exam every time a flea or worm product is needed.

      "# Post ID bblp08: Any issues with Chewy.com prescriptions? with +8 score by [(apleasance, Reddit, 2019-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/bblp08/any_issues_with_chewycom_prescriptions/)\nI decided to order heartworm and flea and tick scripts from Chewy this time vs. my vet.  They called last night and said that they have seen dogs have adverse reactions after taking prescriptions from Chewy, that they may use expired or poorly-sourced prescriptions.   This was all after she tried to get us to order from her instead.  When we said we wanted to use Chewy just out of convenience, she said we would have to come sign a waiver.  Just wondered if anyone had heard anything similar?\n\n## Comment ID ekjqcbe with +6 score by [(endoftheline22, Reddit, 2019-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/bblp08/any_issues_with_chewycom_prescriptions/ekjqcbe/) (in reply to ID bblp08):\nAt my vet we do not recommend buying things like medications from chewy because we do not know if their medications are stored properly (like sitting in a hot warehouse) or if it’s actually name brand so we tell clients it’s best to get it directly from your vet. Just so you know they do have a legit reason for saying that to you.\n\n### Comment ID ekjv556 with +6 score by [(boobiesiheart, Reddit, 2019-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/bblp08/any_issues_with_chewycom_prescriptions/ekjv556/) (in reply to ID ekjqcbe):\nHow does the vet know it was stored properly before they got it?\n\n#### Comment ID ekkhnje with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/bblp08/any_issues_with_chewycom_prescriptions/ekkhnje/) (in reply to ID ekjv556):\nHow do we know the vets store it properly if they get them?\n\n#### Comment ID ekjv98a with +1 score by [(endoftheline22, Reddit, 2019-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/bblp08/any_issues_with_chewycom_prescriptions/ekjv98a/) (in reply to ID ekjv556):\nIt’s bought right from the source while online pharmacy’s might be using third parties\n\n## Comment ID ekjn49j with +5 score by [(SabrinaFaire, Reddit, 2019-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/bblp08/any_issues_with_chewycom_prescriptions/ekjn49j/) (in reply to ID bblp08):\nI get prednilosone from Chewy for my cat because it's SO MUCH cheaper.

My vet tried telling me that some crazy stuff about they don't know who the manufacturers are and I was trying to order the same brand heartworm they carry. They just want me to have to go there once a month and pay for the visit and a $10 pill. Chewy tried getting the ok and the vet said I have to go pick up a written prescription and mail it to Chewy. It's because they want me to pay for an office visit again and I was just there. Also when I did go I asked if I could order anywhere and was told no. At this point I trust Chewy more than the vet and am looking for a new one. One that's not just about the money. I'm on disability and don't drive so they really messed things up by not just authorizing. Chewy actually gave me a refund for my entire order because I added extra toys for the free shipping. They said to let them know how much my vet wants to walk in and get the prescription.\n\n## Comment ID ihd7mkp with +2 score by [(BeazleyBo, Reddit, 2022-07-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/bblp08/any_issues_with_chewycom_prescriptions/ihd7mkp/) (in reply to ID bblp08):\nStorage and shipping temperature of drugs matters because temps too high or too low can cause the quality and effectiveness of the medicine to be compromised.  \n\nSome medication ,  such as heart worm medicine is temperature sensitive (it even says so right on the packaging)  and if a pet pharmacy does not ship medications in an appropriate temperature controlled box, then a beloved pet can be adversely affected.  For example, the heartworm medication could be ineffective at preventing heartworms.\n\n## Comment ID ekjlmgo with +2 score by [(Laserguy74, Reddit, 2019-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/bblp08/any_issues_with_chewycom_prescriptions/ekjlmgo/) (in reply to ID bblp08):\nMy Mom and Dad have used Chewy for everything for a long time.

I can browse and search for stuff, but as soon as I open my cart it says “error 503” so I’m unable to order anything. I tried a live chat to ask what I should do about the issue and it connected me with a Tiana B who was extremely rude. Then I found there was a phone number I could call. So I called the number, explained the issue and the man said he would send a message to their IT department to get the issue resolved which he said would take 24-48 hours. This has been going on for about 2 weeks now and it’s extremely frustrating because there are things I need to order for my dogs and it seems as though nobody is doing anything to try to resolve the issue and I’m at a loss. I don’t know what to do anymore, I might just have to uninstall the app if it won’t even work. And yes my app is updated, and no there is nothing wrong with my phone.",

When you set up items on auto ship…you start to notice when the bill is now $20 more than last time. Basically, make sure your auto ship is getting the auto ship discount every month on your items. \nI’ll be shopping locally. I don’t appreciate CHEWY playing in my face while they have my credit card info…then their chat agents act dense. I’m literally looking at the product and seeing the auto ship price wasn’t applied, although you already charged my card. Your shareholders can shove it.",

Nor is the replacement bag Chewy sent to my house because even with loads of evidence that FedEx has been doing a TERRIBLE job of delivering my dog food, Chewy still sent a replacement via FedEx. Finally I had the idea to have a bag sent to a different location, where I would pick it up. So they have successfully sent two bags of food to a location for me to pick up via FedEx, but the packages to my house have been ‘out for delivery’ so many days im about to block chewy emails because I get them every day that FedEx lied and says it’s out for delivery again only for FedEx to not show up and then put in the system that I requested a future delivery date, which is also a lie. Chewy knows this, knows I now have to drive an hour to pick up food that I buy because it is supposed to be conveniently left at my door. I am so done with Chewy. I’ve talked to so many people that work there and only one ever followed up. Chewy’s script they give their employees is full of warm words, but warm words don’t give my dogs warm, full, tummies. I guess Chewy is finally like every other big company, people like me are ‘built in loss’ thats expected, what do they care, Chewy will still make loads of money this year. I am just one customer they lost, no big deal. But I will definitely be telling everyone I know to avoid them.",

          "content": "I’ve always used Chewy for my multiple pets over the years simply because they had a great selection of pet supplies and I can conveniently have things auto shipped to me for a small discount and I don’t have to remember to order the essentials all the time. Not only are they a great company in general, but their customer service department is top notch. They’ve helped me multiple times with returns or any issues that I’ve had (which hasn’t been many), but they also sent me a heartfelt card with a small vase of flowers to my apartment after my dear sweet Gypsy passed. What a sweet and thoughtful company. I will never stop using Chewy for multiple reasons, but having a company that is empathetic and has a human touch is something that will keep me as a lifelong customer of theirs! Thank you for being amazing 💜 (shout out to Ayla in the customer service department specifically for making this happen. You are a wonderful person!)",

The latest version of your app has basically rendered the app useless to screen reader user, such as myself. In the past, I have been able to use the app without any issues. However, now it is impossible for me to search for items, get details on items, add items to my basket without calling your customer service phone number. This is something I prefer not to do. per the ADA, your app needs to be made accessible for all users, no matter the disability. Your customer care team has been wonderful, but. my having to call customer care to look for items and place an order does not put me on equal footing with everyone else. Could the developers, please, please look into fixing the accessibility problems with the app?",

Through it all I continued to have great numbers across my scorecard never any performance issues and show up to work on time.After having 2 days of internet issues, which I had documents from my Internet provider, they fired me. Less then a week from Christmas. When you work at chewy you are required to submit \"wows\" for the customers, like when they send flowers for a pet passing. I received nothing from chewy with the passing of my mother in law, not a card, no email, not I'm sorry not a word, but they pretend to be empathetic to all. Chewy does not see employees as actual humans but just as numbers. I was fired with no warning after HR decided an outage cause by an Internet upgrade does not count as an outage. I feel anytime the Internet is out for whatever the reason, the service is OUT there for an outage. HR only responds with copy and pasted responses and can not even form an email.",

Yet we can all plainly see the abject waste of money we go through quarter after quarter. Shadow IT is everywhere, with several tools and apps all doing the same exact thing, but rolled out to different teams because IT wasn't involved. Some teams are so understaffed that their workload is becoming backed up for days, weeks, and sometimes months, and leadership just accepts it. I'll never understand why because these conversations happen behind closed doors, and senior leadership is trained to be as evasive and opaque as humanly possible. I just don't really get why the company is so skittish to invest in the people they have.",

While other companies are following Amazon and are aggressively returning to office, Chewy is still pretty flexible, and this is something that I appreciate more than they know.\n\nBusiness outlook is pretty good, the stock is pretty good, and we're not expecting any business turbulence outside of restructuring to adapt to market conditions (which is an unfortunate reality in today's world, our new normal).

This is far from a job, a job wouldn't force you to work doubles back to back, they wouldn't force you to come in on your days off. They don't care if you just did a double double they'll still call you right back in. Best ways to avoid jobs like this is to literally avoid jobs like this, no matter how desperate you get don't apply here. There's no point in standing your ground telling them you won't do overtime or whatever the case may be because anybody who takes these jobs have to do overtime at some point otherwise they'll get fired so why take a job that you know your own borrowed time as you'll end up getting fired for not doing overtimes or weekends or whatever the case may be. Nobody pays enough to literally not have a life.",

We recently even had a family day event where we got to take the workday off fully paid to go and have fun at an indoor race track and arcades place with our families. All i was looking for honestly was just a place where i could have lunch and be able to use the bathroom. But Chewy gave me so much more.",

The company forces you to “engage” with customers, even though most just want a friendly call and not a person over-stepping boundaries with unrelated questions. The company uses an AI to listen to calls which ranks your empathy, rapport, ownership, personalization, and professionalism. It being AI is the issue. We are not given a script to say to customers but we are expected to meet percentage criteria based off of the things the AI looks for. There are keywords that the AI looks for but the fact that you could lose your job if an AI claims you are “not empathetic enough” is absolutely insane. On top of this, restroom breaks and pretty much anything that might come up in your house while you are working is based off a “not ready” time that must be under a certain percentage. This is understandable if it wasn’t for the fact that Not Ready time included required daily meetings, manager meetings, and work related time off calls like writing notes or doing required quizzes for brand trainings. On top of all of that, the percentage you must meet for this is lowered every quarter so even if you meet the insane goals the company sets, it will eventually fall more. They also have a bunch of other things like “recommending” Chewy services to customers who don’t ask about them, but yet they stress we’re not sales people. Additionally, they do not accommodate to students or anyone who doesn’t have a disability. \n\n\nOverall, it is an extremely stressful job and the company continues to show that they see their employees as numbers rather than actual people. With the bar for rates to be met being raised often and no room for restroom breaks or even time between calls just to breathe, I would not recommend this job to anybody with any form of anxiety.",

The new department is not doing well (Chewy Vetcare) and as a result they have been terminating people left and right while they try to get their ducks in a row. My advice-- Get Mita out of as president of Chewy Healthcare as she has ZERO knowledge on how to successfully run and manage a veterinary business. It's very political as she is the wife of the CEO, Sumit, so change will not happen because she is protected. Also, she modeled all of the hospitals to have a very 'salon' and 'upscale' appearance. It's a hospital-not a spa, the functionality of the space is laughable if you have experience in practice management at other more established companies.

It's essentially going through a bit of 'workload inflation\" where the scope you are expected to take on within your level or job class is increasing. It's definitely a good thing long term - in other words, 5 years from now, we won't suffer from the leadership bloat that affects many business. However, while living through it, it can be tough to get promoted, or get members of your team promoted, even if you or they have greatly increased scope over several years, given that that simply has become the new expectation and standard. It's not a con for the business, and new team members coming in might not even notice, but it's felt internally. The good news buried inside of this con is that you will get an opportunity to take on more scope that you otherwise might have, and it's a good forcing function to growing your remit, learning more about the business, and getting increased exposure.",

My advice-- Get Mita out of as president of Chewy Healthcare as she has ZERO knowledge on how to successfully run and manage a veterinary business. It's very political as she is the wife of the CEO, Sumit, so change will not happen because she is protected. Also, she modeled all of the hospitals to have a very 'salon' and 'upscale' appearance. It's a hospital-not a spa, the functionality of the space is laughable if you have experience in practice management at other more established companies.

We are not given a script to say to customers but we are expected to meet percentage criteria based off of the things the AI looks for. There are keywords that the AI looks for but the fact that you could lose your job if an AI claims you are “not empathetic enough” is absolutely insane. On top of this, restroom breaks and pretty much anything that might come up in your house while you are working is based off a “not ready” time that must be under a certain percentage. This is understandable if it wasn’t for the fact that Not Ready time included required daily meetings, manager meetings, and work related time off calls like writing notes or doing required quizzes for brand trainings. On top of all of that, the percentage you must meet for this is lowered every quarter so even if you meet the insane goals the company sets, it will eventually fall more. They also have a bunch of other things like “recommending” Chewy services to customers who don’t ask about them, but yet they stress we’re not sales people. Additionally, they do not accommodate to students or anyone who doesn’t have a disability. \n\n\nOverall, it is an extremely stressful job and the company continues to show that they see their employees as numbers rather than actual people. With the bar for rates to be met being raised often and no room for restroom breaks or even time between calls just to breathe, I would not recommend this job to anybody with any form of anxiety.",

Yet we can all plainly see the abject waste of money we go through quarter after quarter. Shadow IT is everywhere, with several tools and apps all doing the same exact thing, but rolled out to different teams because IT wasn't involved. Some teams are so understaffed that their workload is becoming backed up for days, weeks, and sometimes months, and leadership just accepts it. I'll never understand why because these conversations happen behind closed doors, and senior leadership is trained to be as evasive and opaque as humanly possible.

While other companies are following Amazon and are aggressively returning to office, Chewy is still pretty flexible, and this is something that I appreciate more than they know.\n\nBusiness outlook is pretty good, the stock is pretty good, and we're not expecting any business turbulence outside of restructuring to adapt to market conditions (which is an unfortunate reality in today's world, our new normal).

      "# [Chewy returns to member growth with better site experiences by Bryan Wassel on 2024-12-12](https://www.retaildive.com/news/chewy-updated-experiences-active-customers-membership-q3/735183/)\nDive Brief:\n\nChewy executives credited a combination of customer experience and marketing for a return to customer growth during a Q3 2024 earnings call Wednesday. Chewy reached 20.2 million active customers in its latest quarter, up 160,000 from the previous quarter, but fell 0.5% year over year.\n\nThe pet retailer’s updated mobile app experience, which emphasized convenience, helped create a mid-teens boost in unique customers and average monthly app users compared to Q3 2023, according to CEO Sumit Singh.\n\nChewy Vet Care, its in-person veterinary clinics, are also showing promise, according to CFO David Reeder. The six existing locations earned high net promoter scores for their customer service, and more than half of new customers who visit clinics shop online after their trip.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nChewy is marrying a better site experience with marketing campaign execution to fuel customer and sales growth. Net sales grew 4.8% year over year in the third quarter, reaching $2.88 billion and exceeding the retailer’s guidance.\n\n“We are continuously rolling out enhancements to our on-site and in-app experiences to ensure we are providing an even more enjoyable and convenient shopping journey for pet parents,” Singh said.\n\nThe company is focusing on connecting its marketing funnel to expanded audiences, according to Singh. Once customers are on the site, Chewy’s improved experience and product assortment can help turn interest into purchases.\n\nThe retailer has improved its ability to identify and segment existing customers to encourage repeat purchases, sign up for automatic shipments and engage with the mobile app. This will be a key part of the company’s 2025 strategy.\n\nThe Chewy+ paid membership program, which offers perks including free returns and 24/7 customer service, is driving sales as well, according to Singh. Chewy+ members place more orders and have greater mobile app engagement than non-members.\n\nThe program, which launched in the summer, is young enough that it only offers an “immaterial” contribution to Chewy’s bottom line, according to Singh. However, Singh is encouraged by the early results and looks forward to expanding the program to a broader audience.\n\n“Overall, we're playing a pretty strong playbook, continuing to differentiate ourselves, both in terms of the basics of the category on price and convenience and assortment, but also in bringing new innovations to life,” Singh said.",
      "# [Chewy grows net sales 4.8% in Q3 earnings results by Kevin Williams, Mary Meisenzahl, Bloomberg News on 2024-12-06](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/chewy-quarterly-sales/)\nChewy, Inc., the pet food and supplies retailer, continued to show growth in its latest quarterly earnings, achieving a 4.8% year-over-year increase in Q3 net sales, which totaled $2.88 billion.\n\nThe company has seen consistent year-over-year growth in its online sales, even as rates of growth have fallen.\n\nCurrently, Chewy is No. 10 in the Top 1000, which is Digital Commerce 360’s database ranking North America’s largest online retailers by their annual web sales. In the Top 1000, Digital Commerce 360 categorizes Chewy as a Specialty retailer. Digital Commerce 360 projects that Chewy online sales will close out 2024 at $11.59 billion.\n\nChewy web sales by year\n\nChewy quarterly sales highlights in Q3\n\nChewy’s CEO lauded the earnings report.\n\n“Our third quarter results continued to build on the positive momentum we observed in Q2,” said Sumit Singh, Chewy’s CEO. “These results underscore the durability of our business model and our team’s relentless focus on high-quality execution and operational discipline.”\n\nAside from net sales figures, the company also reported the following:\n\nGross margin of 29.3% increased 80 basis points year over year\n\nNet income of $3.9 million, including share-based compensation expense and related taxes of $80.4 million\n\nAdjusted EBITDA of $138.2 million, an increase of $55.7 million year over year\n\nAdjusted net income of $84.9 million, an increase of $21.5 million year over year\n\nAreas of business growth for Chewy\n\nThe company’s auto-ship program (which sends pet food to regular customers on a schedule) has helped drive growth. Revenue from auto-ship was $2.3 million compared with $2.1 million during Q3 last year.\n\nIn an earnings call, Singh also pointed to the growth in the company’s clinics, Chewy Vet Care.\n\n“Performance across our clinic footprint is promising,” Singh said\n\nHe added that the clinics are helping to acquire new customers and funnel them into the Chewy ecosystem.\n\n“Broader ecosystem benefits, including cross-category shopping and post-clinic visit purchases on chewy.com, have strengthened since last quarter, indicating that our ability to seamlessly connect care with commerce is resonating with pet parents,” he explained.\n\nChewy’s success and expectations\n\nRetail experts were more restrained in their praise of Chewy.\n\nMichael Nemeroff, ecommerce expert and CEO and co-founder of RushOrderTees, told Digital Commerce 360 that Chewy has trained investors to expect big profits.\n\n“Chewy is doing well with building consistent revenue growth, but their share value has actually dropped over the past few days because ‘good enough’ is no longer good enough,” Nemeroff assessed, adding that investors expect big growth in retail, but a 5% improvement doesn’t “wow” them. Nevertheless, Nemeroff said, projections of 13% growth from Chewy in the current quarter remained promising.\n\n“Chewy has built a loyal customer base but faces competition from giants like Amazon,” he stated. “If they can find a way to manage costs and offer better value than price leaders, they’ll continue to stand out and increase their following even further.”\n\nChallenges ahead for Chewy\n\nMichael Zakkour, a retail-focused founder and chief strategist at the retail consultancy 5 New Digital, pointed out that the number of active customers declined by 0.5% to 20.2 million, while operating expenses rose by 3.3% year over year to $818.2 million.\n\n“Despite the mixed results, I am forecasting healthy growth for the company in 2025, driven by several factors, including its commitment to adding services,” Zakkour said, citing the “Connect With a Vet” and insurance plans; the strength of its subscription model, “Autoship”; and the pet care digital commerce segment growing at a 12% compound annual growth rate.\n\nZakkour says Chewy will continue to have to innovate and evolve to fend off rivals.\n\n“While Chewy is the market leader in pet care ecommerce, PetSmart and Amazon have stepped up their investment and focus on ecommerce, so Chewy will need to adjust to a more competitive landscape,” Zakkour said, pointing to the decrease in customers as a possible red flag.\n\n“Chewy needs to improve customer retention rates and decrease operating expenses, as reflected in its earnings report,” Zakkour says.\n\nPercentage changes may not align exactly with dollar figures due to rounding.

      "# [CARE for Pets™ on 2017-01-17](https://www.pets.care/medications/)\nStudy conducted by CARE for Pets™ reveals many veterinary consolidators communicate misleading statements about ownership information on their individual practice websites which is most likely to create a false impression to pet owners that the practice is independently owned and locally operated. Most veterinary practices acquired by corporate consolidators often retain their original company name and may purposely avoid corporate ownership identification -- hide ownership.\n\nIs Your 'Local' Animal Hospital Corporate-Owned?\n\nCOMMON PERCEPTIONS ABOUT CORPORATE PRACTICES\n\nThere is a common perception in the pet care industry that many corporate-owned veterinary practices prioritize profits over patient care -- doctors feel more pressure to generate revenue and see more clients per shift. A common strategy for consolidators is to increase revenue by raising prices after an acquisition -- increase in upselling to clients. Studies in human medicine show that private equity takeovers are linked to rising costs for patients and sinking quality of care. Understanding private equity investments in human medicine will provide insight into its potential impact to veterinary medicine.\n\nCommon Perceptions of Corporate Veterinary Practices\n\nWHO OWNS, OPERATES AND CONTROLS THE PRACTICE?\n\nCARE for Pets™ officially launches VERIFIED,™ the first and only veterinary practice ownership verification online tool for the pet care industry -- do you know who owns your vet? Consolidators buying hospitals often require the selling doctor to stay at the veterinary practice for 1 to 4 years post-sale and may fail to disclose change of ownership to pet owners -- \"golden handcuffs.\" Advertising is ethical when there are no false, deceptive, or misleading statements or claims.\n\nHEIGHTENED SCRUTINY OF PRIVATE EQUITY M&A DEALS\n\nToday, 3 out of 4 specialty and emergency hospitals in the U.S. are owned by corporate consolidators -- state legislator asks Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to scrutinize closure of emergency hospital. Private equity firms increasingly engage in roll up strategies that allow them to accrue market power off the commission’s radar -- senators urged the FTC and congress to take stronger action against consolidation in the veterinary care industry.\n\nFTC Intervenes PE Acquisition Citing Antitrust Concerns\n\nEXIT-DRIVEN STRATEGY: BUYING UP HOSPITALS TO SELL\n\nRoll-ups, a common strategy for consolidators, buys many veterinary practices and combines them into a larger organization to obtain a higher valuation -- grow rapidly. The entity is typically resold within 3 to 5 years to another consolidator for a substantial profit. Hospital groups sell for 100s of millions of dollars -- many times over $1 billion.\n\nFlipping Hospitals Reap Large Profits for Consolidators\n\nCONSOLIDATORS PRIORITIZING PROFITS OVER PATIENTS\n\nOur research shows that common complaints among employees of corporate-owned veterinary practices say their employers prioritize short-term profits -- numerous red flags. Reading company reviews at popular job websites about the corporate consolidator that owns the individual practice can provide greater insight into the company's true priorities, work conditions, culture, and leadership. However, gag clauses are on the rise which may silence doctors and staff -- stifle public debate about the effects of rapid veterinary consolidation.\n\nCommon Employee Complaints of Veterinary Consolidators\n\nARE CONSOLIDATORS EXACERBATING VET SHORTAGE?\n\nFirst-of-its-kind study reveals that veterinarians working in corporate practices reported feeling more pressure than those in private practice to generate revenue and see more clients per shift. There is a large mismatch between employees' purpose and consolidators -- employees and clients blindsided by abrupt closure of hospital. Consolidators primary focus on profits is negatively impacting the workplace culture -- cause burnout and drives workers away from the profession.\n\nCONSOLIDATORS ENDLESS PURSUIT OF PROFITS\n\nLarge consolidators often make hundreds of millions of dollars a year while many of its employees struggle to earn a livable wage and owners deal with high vet bills -- consolidator launches sale process. The prioritization of profits will continue indefinitely unless workers and consumers pushback.\n\nACCELERATE POSITIVE CHANGE IN PET CARE INDUSTRY\n\nAs \"the internet's most trusted consumer advocate for the pet care industry,\"™ CARE for Pets™ seeks to empower pet owners to effect positive change in the pet care industry in order to provide the best care for all companion animals.\n\nABOUT US | BETTER CARE FOR PETS™ | TRADEMARKS\n\nCopyright © Watchdog Media Group™\n\nAll Rights Reserved 2014-2025",

      "# [Chewy holds the top spot as overall satisfaction with online retail declines by Bryan Wassel on 2025-01-30](https://www.customerexperiencedive.com/news/digital-retailers-satisfaction-declines-acsi-chewy/738804/)\nDive Brief:\n\nCustomer satisfaction with online retailers fell over the past year, according to an American Customer Satisfaction Index study released Tuesday. The report, which was based on 41,850 consumer surveys, found satisfaction fell 1% since last year to a score of 79 on a 100-point scale.\n\nMore than two-thirds of online retailers saw satisfaction declines from the prior retail study, which was released in January 2024.\n\nChewy bucked the trend and maintained the highest overall customer satisfaction among online retailers with a score of 85, up 1% from the previous study. Chewy has held the top spot for the past three years.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nRetailers that evolve their digital shopping experiences to keep up with technology advancements can better maintain their luster.\n\nToday’s customers expect detailed product images, relevant reviews and useful recommendations, according to Forrest Morgeson, assistant professor of marketing at Michigan State University and director of research emeritus at ACSI. These features can help guide shoppers through the purchase process.\n\n“Customer satisfaction is susceptible to decline if any stagnation or falling behind in these areas is detected,” Morgeson said in an email. “These factors against the backdrop of persistent inflation in a hyper-competitive market culminate in a fair number of retailers seeing a modest-to-moderate decrease in satisfaction.”\n\nRetailers that have the basics down can look to extra bells and whistles that help them stand out from the competition.\n\nFor instance, Chewy’s success was driven by an emphasis on customer experience, according to Morgeson. Little perks become welcome additions when the baseline experience is already solid.\n\n“Small investments like custom e-cards to wish happy birthday to pets establish a connection with customers,” Morgeson said. “When this level of service is backed by a strong platform from a technical perspective, high customer satisfaction and loyalty follow.”",
      "# [Chewy peak season aided by automation by Alejandra Carranza, Emma Cosgrove, Max Garland on 2024-12-10](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/chewy-automated-fulfillment-centers-q3-2024/735062/)\nChewy’s automated fulfillment centers combined with an “improved supply chain tool” helped the company handle its highest order period during the holiday peak in late November, Chewy CEO Sumit Singh said in a Dec. 4 earnings call.\n\n“The team is executing very well and the automation that's been referenced here is a big contributor to that, both in terms of output as well as efficiency and productivity,” CFO David Reeder said in the call.\n\nCurrently, less than half of Chewy's volumes moving through its distribution centers are handled using automation, the CEO said. The e-tailer plans to continue automating its network and eventually hopes to have more than 70% of its volumes fulfilled using automated processes.\n\nIt is unclear what the mentioned supply chain tool is, and Chewy did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication.\n\n“And if you look at just the [fulfillment center] itself, we have said it drives improvement to the tune of up to 50% in productivity, 30% in volume per square foot, and up to 60% improvements in ergonomics and safety. And those results are pretty true even now,” Singh said.\n\nChewy began to automate some of it fulfillment centers to reduce operational costs and improve the cycle time between an order submission and a box landing on a truck, according to former VP of operations Mike Gilbert.\n\nThe CEO said in the call that the pet e-tailer currently has six fulfillment centers that are automated, including in locations such as Tennessee, Nevada, Missouri and Pennsylvania.",
      "# [Abandoned in a Bag and Unable to Walk: Chewy’s Brave Steps to Recovery](https://www.aspca.org/news/abandoned-bag-and-unable-walk-chewys-brave-steps-recovery)\nLast December, outside of the NYPD’s 24th Precinct in the Upper West Side of Manhattan, a large cloth bag was dropped at the door by an unknown person. When the police opened it, they discovered a very ill 2-year-old dog, and they knew that he was in urgent need of medical care. He was extremely underweight, to the point that he was unable to stand up, and he could barely lift his head. He was likely mere days away from starving to death.\n\nChewy, as he was later named, was quickly taken to the Veterinary Emergency Group in the Upper East Side, where their staff helped carefully stabilize him overnight. The following day, he was transferred to the Veterinary Emergency and Referral Group (VERG) in Brooklyn for further treatment by veterinary criticalists – Chewy’s situation was so severe that he needed to be monitored 24/7 by these specialized doctors.\n\nAt VERG, it was determined that Chewy’s heart had difficulties contracting, he lost a significant amount of blood in his gastrointestinal tract, and he had a distended stomach with foreign material inside. He received an endoscopy to remove the material from his stomach, and the staff were surprised to find that he had ingested two pairs of men’s underwear. It was thought that Chewy must have eaten the underwear simply because he was so hungry.\n\nThe medical team at VERG began a refeeding protocol to slowly and safely reintroduce food to Chewy’s body. This protocol is vital for severely emaciated dogs like him, because if they eat too much food too quickly, they may deal with a life-threatening complication called refeeding syndrome. For the first few days, he needed a stomach tube because his GI tract was too compromised to eat on his own. He also required nutritional supplements, heart medication and blood products (packed red blood cells and albumin) to address the various problems caused by prolonged starvation.\n\nOnce Chewy no longer needed such an intense level of care and monitoring, he was ready to transfer to the ASPCA Animal Hospital (AAH), where he would continue to receive critical treatment.\n\nChewy, upon intake at the ASPCA. He was too weak to stand on his own and had to be assisted.\n\nGetting Back on His Feet\n\nWhen he first arrived at AAH, Chewy was still so weak that he was unable to stand without being held up, and he was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. However, our medical team was encouraged by his social demeanor, as he would bark for attention and calm down while being pet. In the ICU, he received “down dog” care, which involved frequently rotating and flipping his body around to prevent sores from laying in the same position for too long.\n\nDue to significant muscle wasting, Chewy would end up needing weeks of intensive care to help him stand up again. The dedicated staff began treating Chewy with a form of physical therapy, to help him rebuild the muscle that he had lost. He was soon showing incredible progress, and every day, he was able to stay standing for just a little bit longer. After two weeks of this consistent care, he was able to walk the length of the ICU without support! And after three weeks, he was walking around on his own and looking stronger than ever.\n\nDr. Aubrey Crowley, Medical Supervisor, has worked at the ASPCA for seven years, caring for many animals who were victims of cruelty. But there hadn’t been anyone like Chewy.\n\n“Chewy is, to date, the worst emaciation case I've seen who went on to make a full recovery,” Dr. Crowley says. “During those weeks in the ICU, I spent a good deal of time with him, examining him and adjusting his medical management plan daily, as needed. I grew very attached to him because, in spite of what he had been through, he remained an incredibly sweet boy who just wanted pets and attention.”\n\nChewy was soon strong enough to stand on his own and enjoy longer walks to the park.\n\nIn January, four weeks after he was abandoned at the police precinct, Chewy was strong enough to move out of the hospital and to the ASPCA Animal Recovery Center (ARC). Now in their capable hands, he continued to receive expert care on his road to recovery. Over the following few weeks, the staff carefully increased the length of both his walk time and the amount of food he was given. His weight was improving, as well as his heart condition. An echocardiogram showed that Chewy’s heart was back to full function, so he no longer needed his heart medication. One by one, his other medications and supplements were also able to be stopped. Soon enough, he had more than doubled his original weight, and he was finally ready to be adopted!\n\nNow that Chewy was feeling much healthier and stronger, he made one more move to the ASPCA Adoption Center. The Adoption Center team quickly began to see his loving and silly personality emerge. He loved to take long walks to a nearby park, and he was a star in playgroup with the other dogs! Chewy’s love for exercise and play was like he was making up for all that time he lost when he was so sick.\n\n“Once he moved to the Adoption Center,” Dr. Crowley says, “I took any free time I had to take him on extended walks, and I was always so happy to see how much he was continuing to thrive.”\n\nIn April, Dr. Crowley was happy to help Chewy take some photos for his adoption profile. During their photo shoot, he wanted nothing more than pets, belly rubs and snuggles with one of his biggest fans!\n\nNot long after those photos were taken, Chewy’s online profile was seen by his future adopter.\n\n“To see not only that he made it as far as he did, to this young, healthy, robust dog,” Dr. Crowly says, “but that he found a loving, safe home where he is cherished and met with patience and understanding of where he came from is like the biggest reward for doing this job.”\n\nDr. Aubrey Crowley and Chewy.\n\nChewy Meets His BFF\n\nBrandon B. had been living in New York City for over a year when he first thought that a dog companion would be a good way to stay active and get out of the house more. He never had a dog of his own, and after doing some research, he decided that adopting would be the best way to go.\n\n“Chewy’s face was one of the first that popped up on the ASPCA website, and I sent his picture to my girlfriend,” Brandon says. “I asked her, ‘Hey, should I adopt him?’”\n\nBrandon initially didn’t apply for Chewy online, thinking that he was already adopted. However, when he visited the Adoption Center a little while later, they mentioned that Chewy was one of their available dogs!\n\n“I had recognized the name and told them, ‘Wait! I think he was literally my first choice when searching!’” Brandon says. “And lo and behold, it was him!”\n\nWhen they finally got to meet, Brandon saw that Chewy was an energetic and happy boy who loved getting pets. The moment Chewy flipped over and asked him for belly rubs, he knew that was the dog for him. Soon enough, they were finalizing the adoption, and they headed out to start their new life together.\n\nBrandon B. and his girlfriend, Elena D., after adopting Chewy and turning a new leaf!\n\nA New Zeal for Life\n\nWhen they first arrived home, Chewy could barely contain his joy and had a potty accident.\n\n“His excitement would sometimes get the best of him, and he would run around nibbling on whatever he could – including me,” says Brandon.\n\nIn the early days, Chewy was living up to his name and playfully mouthed Brandon, as well as other household objects within his reach. On walks through their neighborhood, he would also bark at people passing by on the street. Despite those hurdles, Brandon continued to take an understanding and patient approach, as Chewy just went through a massive transition into a new home with a new friend.\n\n“Over time, I assured him that he was in a safe space where no one means him any harm – and he could relax,” Brandon says. “I was like, ‘You’re here to stay, buddy. This is it!’”\n\nChewy has since settled down and adjusted well to his new, happy life. He even feels much more at ease on his walks, too. Brandon introduced him to other people in his neighborhood, and Chewy is now much more friendly and inviting.\n\nBrandon also now knows that Chewy is simply an excitable boy sometimes, especially if he’s going to get pets and attention from a friend. With some patience and asking Chewy to take things easy, he now calms down nicely so that he can get some well-deserved love.\n\n“He’s such a chill pup,” Brandon says. “We’ve both learned so much from each other and adjusted to each other’s habits.”\n\nThese days, life is great for these two best friends. Brandon is now well-attuned to Chewy’s wants and needs, such as when he whines and needs to go for a walk, or when he’s looking for some playful attention. Chewy is a smart pup who is working on perfecting his training commands, and he’s socializing a little more with other people and dogs – without getting too excited!\n\nBrandon also decided on a perfect new name for his buddy – Risotto, or Rizzo for short!\n\nChewy, now known as Risotto, and his new cozy life.\n\nEnjoying Life – Together\n\nBrandon is also grateful for the ways that Risotto has changed his life for the better. He previously struggled to build more structure in his life, but this newfound responsibility as a dog parent has made that easy.\n\n“Now that he’s here, we both get plenty of exercise with our walks in the park,” Brandon says. “And he does his job quite well of supporting me emotionally, by cuddling in bed with me every chance he gets!”\n\nRisotto’s experience with extreme hunger and emaciation may have also made an impact on his personality today, but he’s still just like any other dog who loves food! Whenever it’s mealtime, he jumps up happily and shows Brandon gratitude for his new life.\n\n“Not having access to food definitely reflects to how he eats now,” Brandon says. “Now that he’s gotten bigger, it makes me happy to see. I can tell we’re heading in a good direction!”\n\nRisotto has had an incredible journey to find his person. Just like the medical staff that helped bring Rizzo back from the brink, Brandon used an approach of patience, understanding and staying open-minded to give him the best home possible.\n\n“In the beginning, the adjustment period can be a lot of work,” Brandon says, sharing some advice for future adopters. “But once they settle in, you’ll see the peace and appreciation on their face that you gave them a chance.”",

Gill also mocked up his own version of the standard SEC 13G filing form by adding a section stating he was “not a cat.”\n\nGill shot to fame in 2020 after becoming the de facto leader of an online-populist movement to purchase stocks of legacy brick-and-mortar companies like GameStop, AMC and Bed Bath and Beyond, with the stated goal of attempting to turn the companies around. It didn’t quite work — although the movement did successfully create losses for investors who were actively betting against the companies.\n\nBut his trading has also been the subject of scrutiny.\n\nGill now faces a new class-action lawsuit filed in Brooklyn alleging that his most recent trades in GameStop shares amounted to a \"pump and dump\" scheme.\n\nThe plaintiff, Martin Radev, a Nevada resident, representing a class of other GameStop investors, alleges Gill knowingly used his large and influential platform to \"pump\" up the stock price of the company this year by posting online while failing to reveal he had taken up a new position in the company. Gill then successfully sold his shares for a profit, the lawsuit alleges.\n\nThe price of GameStop shares remains higher than before Gill's post but has declined from its peak by about 50%.\n\nThey were down 5% in Monday trading.\n\nIn a twist, GameStop is now run by Ryan Cohen, who also co-founded Chewy. Cohen helped fuel the meme-stock wave after revealing he had taken a large position in GameStop in 2020, several months after Gill first began posting about his position.\n\nCohen is no longer affiliated with Chewy management, and it is not clear whether he and Gill have any relationship. An attorney for Cohen did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe secretary of state of Massachusetts, where Gill resides, is also investigating the GameStop trade.\n\nGill did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "# [Why Your Old Dog Won’t Sleep at Night—and What You Can Do About It by Elizabeth Anderson Lopez on 2015-11-16](https://be.chewy.com/help-my-old-dog-wont-sleep-at-night/)\n“Sleep disruptions can be from a variety of causes, often medical in nature,” Dr. Crosby says. “Causes range from gastrointestinal trouble to urinary system infection to early stages of dementia.” Speak with your veterinarian if your pet is suffering from sleep disruption.\n\nNicholas Dodman, BVMS, MRCVS, DACVB, section head and program director of the Animal Behavior Department of Clinical Sciences at the Cummings Veterinary Medical Center at Tufts University in North Grafton, Massachusetts, distills the potential medical issues further into two categories:\n\nCanine cognitive dysfunction (CCD), also commonly known as canine Alzheimer's or dementia\n\nPain\n\nDementia as a Cause of Dog Insomnia\n\n“Just like people, as dogs get older there is an increasing frequency [of dementia],” Dr. Dodman says.\n\nBecause there’s no test for CCD, diagnosis can be tricky. Essentially, it’s a diagnosis of exclusion when other causes have been ruled out, Dr. Dodman says.\n\nA trip to your veterinarian can help determine the cause of your dog’s insomnia and rule out others. This is often accomplished through performing a physical examination, blood work, and a urinalysis, Dr. Crosby says. After those tests have been completed, your vet may recommend more extensive testing.\n\n“You don’t do a bone scan or MRI willy nilly—only after standard tests have been done,” Dr. Dodman says. Your veterinarian will determine which tests are appropriate for your pet.\n\nSymptoms of canine Alzheimer’s, or senility, that affect sleep include restlessness, disorientation, and confusion. And there may be indicators during the day, too, including house soiling, increased anxiety, reduced appetite, weight loss, and lack of energy.\n\nIf a dog does have CCD, pet parents can help improve their dog’s quality of life with diet, medication, supplements, and cognitive enrichments. Unfortunately, there is no cure to CCD, which is one of the parallels to human Alzheimer’s.\n\nPain as a Cause of Dog Insomnia\n\nAnother possible reason for why a senior dog is restless at night is arthritis and pain, especially due to cancer in dogs, which Dr. Dodman says is the most common cause of death in older dogs.\n\n“Tumors swell and grow and push things around,” Dr. Dodman explains.\n\nAnd if a dog is in pain, that pain can be worse at night because there are no distractions, Dr. Dodman says.\n\nDogs who cannot sleep at night because of fear and anxiety may display signs like enlarged pupils, whale eye (where the whites of the dog’s eyes are visible), tucked tails, and drooling.\n\nSleeplessness may also be caused by seizures in dogs. “Seizures are not as well suppressed as they are during the day, and are especially common in old dogs,” Dr. Dodman says.\n\nEnvironmental Causes for Dog Insomnia\n\nAny change in an adult dog’s behavior is cause for concern, says Pat Miller, CBCC-KA, CPDT-KA, director of Peaceable Paws Dog and Puppy Training in Fairplay, Maryland, and should be discussed with a veterinarian. But sometimes, instead of a medical cause for dog insomnia, there could be external factors causing the sleeplessness that can be easily resolved.\n\nIf your senior dog is restless at night, consider any external changes that have occurred, including:\n\nChanges in the household routine\n\nNew noises outside that may be disturbing your dog\n\nNew household members\n\nReduction in your dog's daily exercise/activity level\n\nThose new noises may be seasonal. For example, a loud snowplow can affect your canine’s ability to sleep and lead to your old dog pacing at night, says Dr. Dodman. Another dog was disturbed when their house’s heating system kicked in, causing sleep issues, Dr. Dodman also recalls.\n\nDog Sleep Apnea and Dog Nightmares\n\nDog Sleep Apnea\n\nPeople who suffer from sleep apnea may be inclined to think that their older dog with sleep issues has dog sleep apnea. But this may prove not to be the issue.\n\nSleep apnea doesn’t necessarily occur in older dogs, but it does with brachycephalic dogs—that is, dog breeds with flat faces, like Pugs and Shih Tzus—especially if they’re overweight, Dr. Dodman says. Possible signs of sleep apnea in dogs include snoring, suddenly waking up to gasp for air, and daytime fatigue.\n\nDog Nightmares\n\nSomething else that can affect a dog’s sleep at any age is nightmares. Dr. Dodman says electroencephalograms (EEGs) demonstrate brainwave activity increases during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the dreaming phase of sleep.\n\nDogs with the condition REM behavior disorder (RBD) physically act out what’s going on, instead of dreaming quietly, displaying the symptoms you would expect of a nightmare. Behaviors typically seen with REM sleep behavior disorders include sudden leg movements, growling, barking, and biting."
