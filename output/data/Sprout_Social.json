      "# [Sprout Social by Melissa Flowers on 2018-09-21](https://sproutsocial.com/security/)\nA proven track-record\n\n99.99% uptime is a key performance indicator (KPI) for our Engineering group. At the time of writing, we had higher than 99.95% uptime over the prior 6 and 12 months.\n\nTransparency to customers\n\nTrust begins with open communication. We publicly share real-time system status and metrics on our Status Websites, https://www.sproutsocialstatus.com for Sprout Social and https://www.sproutadvocacystatus.com for Employee Advocacy. There we communicate incidents and planned maintenance, including any customer impact, and we display system health metrics sourced from independent third-party providers. Customers may subscribe to receive immediate SMS or email notifications of future incidents.\n\nSocial media feeds\n\nOur data ingest layer combines multiple connections to social network APIs. As partners, social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn provide us with higher levels of redundancy and access to their support teams.\n\nBackups\n\nBackups are taken frequently, encrypted in transit and at rest, and are tested regularly. Backups are kept \"off-site\" in Amazon S3 which stores files on multiple physical devices in multiple facilities offering 99.999999999% durability and 99.99% availability.\n\nTransparency to our teams\n\nInternally we practice multidisciplinary, blameless post-mortem analysis, and seek to grow our people, procedures, and systems in the aftermath of failure. Fear is the enemy of progress.\n\nIsolation\n\nOur highly distributed backend platform employs isolation design patterns to mitigate risks across components. Failures of one component rarely affect other components.\n\nRecovery point objectives (RPOs)\n\nRecovery strategies are designed to provide up-to-date RPOs at low Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs), with older data recovered against longer RTOs. This is consistent with customer expectations in Social Media, allowing customers to meet the immediate needs of their customers.\n\nDevOps best practices\n\nOur engineering team practices Infrastructure-as-code, providing correctness, consistency, testability, and speed to recovery. All 24/7/365 on-call team members are empowered to rebuild systems and topologies with full consistency. In the event of system loss, our Engineering team quickly recreates systems by executing the infrastructure code.\n\nMonitoring & on-call support\n\nWe monitor continuously from around the world, displaying, alerting, and reporting upon our entire technical environments in real-time. Supporting customers is a collaboration between our customer-facing support team and our engineering team. Specialized engineers are on call 24/7/365.\n\nWhen problems occur our teams are promptly notified, automatically provided with context, and are enabled with tools to help collaborate efficiently with peers. We employ a triage pager system to ensure alerts quickly and reliably reach engineers.\n\nEncryption at rest & in transit\n\nAll communications over public networks with Sprout Socialâs application and API utilize HTTPS with TLS 1.2 or higher enforced. All data is stored encrypted-at-rest with AES-256 or greater, including backups.\n\nSystem administration\n\nBest practices are utilized, such as least privilege, central configuration management, and stringent host and network firewall policies. Servers are patched automatically on a regular schedule, with high-priority patches applied manually out-of-cycle.\n\nThird party risk management\n\nSprout Social reviews the security posture of our critical third party product and service providers on a regular basis. Sprout Social's subprocessors are contractually required to adhere to an established set of security measures that align with industry best practices.\n\nInformation security policies & standards\n\nSprout Social has implemented a strong information security management system through a comprehensive set of policies and standards covering all aspects of security and privacy. All Employees must affirm their responsibilities in protecting customer data as part of their condition of employment.\n\nSecure support protocols\n\nOur world-class Support team follows phishing and threat-resistant protocols designed by our Security team, when conducting sensitive actions on customer accounts.\n\nOffices\n\nSprout Social offices are secured by keycard access. Office networks are segmented, centrally monitored, and protected by firewalls and Intrusion Prevention devices. Our products have no dependencies on our companyâs offices or other facilities we manage.\n\nDevices\n\nAll Sprout Social devices are inventoried with asset tags and managed with a central mobile device management (MDM) solution.\n\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA)\n\nAccount owners and administrators may require that their users leverage this additional security layer. Sprout Social supports apps like Google Authenticator and others that implement the Time-based One-time Password Algorithm (TOTP) or HMAC-based One-time Password Algorithm (HOTP) for generating passcodes.\n\nSecure credential storage\n\nAccount passwords are salted and hashed using the latest strong algorithms and approaches, which are routinely audited. No human, our staff included, can ever view them. If you lose your password, it can't be recovered and must be reset.\n\nBrute-force protections\n\nIn addition to computationally challenging hashing, our authentication services implement additional rate-limiting protections and ReCAPTCHA.\n\nApproval workflows\n\nAccount Owners and Administrators may restrict certain activities behind approval workflows. These allow for tasks to be divided amongst a team, with the peace of mind that central decision makers may review and control public-facing actions.\n\nIP restrictions\n\nSprout Social may be configured to restrict application and API access from specific IP ranges.\n\nSingle sign-on (SSO)\n\nSprout Social offers SAML 2.0 Single sign-on (SSO) for organizations that leverage this authentication service to give employees one set of login credentials to access multiple applications. Our engineering team works with customers to implement custom SSO integrations across both web and mobile.\n\nEmail signing\n\nSprout Social implements Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) to ensure emails we send are authenticated as coming from Sprout Social, helping to prevent spoofing and ensure authenticity.\n\nAccess permissions\n\nAccount Owners and Administrators may restrict access to profiles, features, actions (including read and write), and other data, by applying granular controls to users on their account.\n\nGlobal publishing pause\n\nIn times of crisis, your team has access to one button that temporarily disables any automated scheduled and queued messages from being sent by Sprout Social. This is accessible from our web and mobile applications.\n\nCustomer protection\n\nSprout Social wants to help you protect yourself from online security threats and have created resources designed to do that, including Security Best Practices and Protecting sensitive information.",

      "# [What is EdgeRank? on 2019-12-17](https://sproutsocial.com/glossary/edgerank/)\nFacebook EdgeRank was another name for the old Facebook algorithm.\n\nThe Facebook algorithm determines how posts are presented to your potential customers and followers. EdgeRank and the newer algorithms use a multitude of mathematical variables and operations to measure the popularity and potential of the material you create for social media.\n\nAccording to Facebook, their algorithm delivers the content that customers most want to see. In recent years, this has lead to a reduced focus on promoted content, and a higher level of priority given to organic material on Facebook.\n\nHow did EdgeRank work?\n\nEdgerank was designed by Serkan Piantino to help organize the masses of material published to Facebook every day. In 2011, Facebook stopped using the EdgeRank system and started to use machine learning algorithms instead.\n\nThe adoption of machine learning means that the new Facebook algorithm is capable of becoming more intelligent and accurate over time. In 2013, the learning algorithm assessed more than 100,000 factors when ranking content. Since then, the level of data that goes into the Facebook algorithm has continued to grow.\n\nThe EdgeRank formula used three main factors to arrange material on your Facebook feed, including:\n\nThe freshness or recency of a post\n\nThe actions taken by users on the post (engagement such as likes, comments and shares)\n\nUser affinity – the relationship between the person viewing the post and the company or individual that published the material.\n\nWhat happened to EdgeRank?\n\nEdgerank was replaced by the machine learning algorithm that Facebook uses today, to ensure that the social channel could deliver the highest quality of content for users. In 2018, Facebook announced that it would be pushing back against branded content and giving audiences more of the authentic, valuable posts they were looking for on the channel.\n\nDespite this, Facebook continues to deliver one of the best ROIs for social media marketers, thanks to the size of the network’s user base.\n\nThe latest algorithm is very similar to Edgerank, as it still considers the “affinity” between people when determining where content should rank. The new algorithm also values genuine engagement too. This means that companies can achieve more considerable attention online by encouraging people to like and comment on their posts.\n\nWhenever the algorithm updates, it means that companies on Facebook need to come up with a new plan for interacting with followers online. In the case of the most recent update, some key tips include:",

      "# [What is a microblog? on 2018-08-03](https://sproutsocial.com/glossary/microblog/)\nA microblog is a short piece of content designed for quick audience interactions.\n\nMicroblogging is a combination of instant messaging and content production. With a microblog, you share short messages with an online audience to improve engagement. Social channels like Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest offer popular platforms for microblogging.\n\nWhat Does a Microblog Look Like?\n\nMicroblogging makes it easier to communicate with audiences quickly. Rather than writing pages of text, a micro blog allows for quick, conversational connections with customers.\n\nShort microblogging messages appear in various content formats, including audio, video, images and text. The trend for microblogging began when social media emerged to provide quicker ways for companies to engage customers. Microblogging also keeps customers informed about the longer content on your website.\n\nTypes of Microblogging Platforms\n\nMost brands already use microblogging platforms in their content plans.\n\nAs more customers look to develop relationships with companies, short and frequent social posts are critical. Additionally, microblogging appeals to the mobile browsing community. Examples of microblogging platforms include:\n\nTwitter: One of the best-known channels in the microblogging world. Twitter is a quick and convenient way to share short posts, GIFs, article links, videos and more.\n\nPinterest: Companies on Pinterest link to products, articles and other useful information for audiences. Descriptions allow for quick content connections.\n\nInstagram: A visual form of microblogging, Instagram allows organizations to share stories and snaps as part of an online narrative.\n\nFacebook: One of the most popular social platforms, Facebook is an effective microblog channel. Users share text, live videos and more to connect with customers.\n\nTumblr: Tumblr is another highly popular microblogging platform. You can tag specific topics to attract attention from targeted audiences.\n\nBenefits of Microblogging\n\nMost companies are already microblogging without realizing it.\n\nA microblogging strategy is a critical part of building connections with modern audiences. Some of the benefits of a microblog include:\n\nFrequent posts: Consistency is key in content marketing. Microblogging allows companies to share shorter content faster. This creates more conversational connections with customers.\n\nLess time developing content: Some companies struggle to create lengthy article content regularly. Microblogs maintain relationships in between longer blog, video and infographic posts.\n\nReal-time sharing: In a fast-paced environment, microblogging allows companies to share time-sensitive information. A quick tweet tells an audience about a sale, breaking news and other crucial updates.\n\nMicroblogging for a Mobile Audience\n\n52.2% of website traffic worldwide was generated by mobile devices in 2018.\n\nAs audiences continue to turn to mobile solutions as an immediate source of information, microblogging is critical. Consumers find it difficult to interact with lengthy posts on mobile. However, microblogs offer instant access to updates and trending news. A microblog strengthens brand relationships in the mobile world.\n\nMany microblogging platforms also offer opportunity for two-way interactions.

      "# [Customer satisfaction score (CSAT): What it is and how to measure it by Dorcas Adisa on 2023-09-20](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/csat/)\nCustomer satisfaction has become an indispensable factor in sustainable business growth.\n\nCustomers now wield more power than ever before and have endless product options. Competition has become increasingly stiff, and only brands focusing on building customer relationships and a loyal following are poised for long-term success. Our survey data shows that 58% of people buy from brands they trust, and 36% choose brands that genuinely understand their needs.\n\nIn this article, we answer everything you need to know about customer satisfaction score (CSAT). We’ll discuss its importance and how to calculate it. Further, we’ll also share strategies to help you improve your CSAT score.\n\nTable of contents:\n\nWhat is CSAT?\n\nHow to calculate CSAT\n\nAlternatives to using CSAT\n\nBenefits of using CSAT\n\nTips for improving CSAT\n\nWhat is CSAT?\n\nA customer satisfaction score, or CSAT, is a customer service metric designed to measure customers’ happiness and satisfaction with a company’s product or service. More than a customer service metric, a customer satisfaction score can be described as a tool that makes it possible for businesses to:\n\nMeasure the quality of customer experience delivered to their customers\n\nCollect user feedback on your brand, product or service\n\nPredict the likelihood of customers churning\n\nCollect data on customer expectations and develop features to meet such expectations.\n\nCSAT is measured individually, meaning the feedback is collected from individual customers at different stages of the customer survey. Companies use CSAT surveys to ask customers simple feedback questions such as “How satisfied are you with your experience?” or “How would you rate our product/service?”\n\nCSAT survey measures satisfaction level on a scale containing either binary response (yes/no), an emoticon scale (😁 or 😞) or on a 5-point or 7-point Likert scale (e.g. 1- Strongly disagree to 5- Strongly agree). You can place these surveys strategically through emails, in-app or online feedback to collect customer feedback.\n\nHow to calculate CSAT\n\nCalculating your CSAT score is quite straightforward. With a CSAT survey, you can ask customers to rate your products or services using a scaled-based response system.\n\nWhen the results are in, you simply divide the total number of happy responses (ratings from 8-10) by the total number of customers surveyed and then multiply by 10.\n\nLet’s assume you receive 150 positive responses from a pool of 250 respondents, your CSAT score would be 60%. Breaking it down,\n\nA CSAT score is calculated on a zero-to-one scale, with 100 percent being the highest score. For many companies, achieving 100% is the goal. However, that is not to say that any score exceeding 50% (ideally 60% or 70%) should not be viewed as positive.\n\nWhile achieving a 100% CSAT score is commendable, it’s also important to benchmark it against other metrics. Compare the total number of CSAT responses you’ve received to the total number of your customers. This way, you can tell if your CSAT score is truly an indicator of your overall customer satisfaction.\n\nFor example, if 100 of your 250 responses are positive, but you have a total of 1,000 customers, then your CSAT score is not a true representation of your customer satisfaction level.\n\nHow to calculate customer satisfaction using Sprout Social\n\nSprout Social users can use the customer feedback tool to build customer satisfaction surveys and collect customer feedback from social platforms. To create customer feedback in Sprout, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1. Log In to your Sprout Social account.\n\nStep 2. Next, access customer feedback configuration. Do this by navigating to “Account and Settings” section. Click on settings.\n\nStep 3. Under “Inbox and reviews,” select customer feedback. Choose the social profile for which you want to configure your CSAT survey.\n\nStep 4. Select the Enable feedback checkbox to configure your survey. Scroll down to the survey section. Here, you can set up CSAT surveys for Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.\n\nStep 5. To automatically send a request for feedback, select Automate.\n\nStep 6. Once you’re done, you can click “Save” to save your settings or “Reset Settings” to start over. You can also customize the appearance of your CSAT survey by selecting Customize under Appearance.\n\nOnce you’ve configured your CSAT survey, Sprout Social will automatically send a feedback request to customers after they interact with your brand on social media. You can view your CSAT results in the Customer Feedback Report. This report shows you the average CSAT score for each social media platform, as well as the percentage of customers who rated their satisfaction as “Very Satisfied.”\n\nAnalyze the results in the Customer Service Feedback Report to gain insights into your CSAT scores and make data-driven decisions to improve your customer experience.\n\nAlternatives to CSAT\n\nBusinesses use customer satisfaction metrics like customer satisfaction score (CSAT), Net Promoter Score (NPS) and Customer Effort Score (CES) depending on the goal they want to achieve. Let’s discuss two alternatives to CSAT.\n\nNet Promoter Score (NPS)\n\nNet Promoter Score (NPS) is a customer satisfaction metric that measures the possibility of users recommending your products to others on a scale of 0-10. It is measured to gauge customer sentiment and loyalty by asking one question: “How likely are you to recommend {product name} to a friend or colleague? ”\n\nNPS scores are good predictors of business growth; a high score indicates a healthy customer relationship, while lower scores say otherwise. With NPS surveys, you can track how certain interactions in the customer journey, for example, feature upgrades, affect customer loyalty over time.\n\nCustomer Effort Score (CES)\n\nThe Customer Effort Score Metric, or CES, is a metric used to evaluate the ease of a customer’s experience with a company. It measures how much effort customers put into interacting with a product to achieve their desired outcome, whether purchasing, resolving an issue or getting support.\n\nCES survey typically asks questions such as “On a scale of 1-5, how easy was it to {experience}?” The score is typically measured on a 5-point or 7-point scale, ranging from “very difficult to very easy.” By measuring CES scores, companies can pinpoint areas where customers are experiencing difficulty and where there’s a need for improvement to make the experience seamless for their customers.\n\n5 benefits of using CSAT\n\nNow that we’ve covered the definitions, let’s understand why you should start using CSAT.\n\n1. CSAT is intuitive and easy to use\n\nCSAT surveys are designed in a way that is easy to understand. They’re user-friendly, easy to understand and can be customized easily without much difficulty. CSAT survey often comes with one question that’s easy to understand and feels interactive to the respondent.\n\n2. Higher response rates\n\nBecause CSAT surveys are short and straight to the point, they usually have a higher response rate. They require minimal time and effort from the customer, and as long as they appear contextually, customers won’t mind sharing their opinions.\n\n3. CSAT allows for more versatile questions\n\nCSAT allows you to ask questions in various ways and based on various experiences, which makes it adaptable to different customer interactions. Its versatility can be valuable when collecting insights from multiple customer experiences and tailoring questions to suit the specific context and goals. For instance, you can tailor one CSAT survey to analyze your customer service and feature interactions.\n\n4. CSAT is better for specific experiences or features\n\nCSAT is suitable for evaluating specific experiences (e.g., onboarding) or product or service features. Every aspect of your product matters, and with CSAT, you can measure how satisfied customers are with that particular aspect of your product offering rather than the overall experience. Address areas with low CSAT scores and clear out friction points to improve the customer experience and satisfaction.\n\n5. Less customer churn\n\nA higher customer satisfaction score leads to higher customer retention and a lower churn rate. Customers come for the product but stay for the experience. A higher satisfaction score indicates that customers are satisfied and will remain loyal to your company.\n\n8 tips for improving CSAT\n\nAchieving a high CSAT score is the primary goal of every organization, but as lovely as that sounds it doesn’t happen overnight. You need to be consistent and apply the following best practices to consistently provide customers with the best experience.\n\n1. Ask the right questions\n\nThe success of a customer satisfaction survey depends on the questions you ask. Good questions should be easy to understand, be answered in a short time and remain relevant to their purpose. The right questions yield accurate responses, but poorly crafted ones can have adverse effects. They introduce survey bias, lower response rates and compromise data quality.\n\nIdentifying bad questions can be challenging, as they often hide in plain sight. So, here’s what you should watch out for:\n\nUsing biased language to prompt positive responses.\n\nQuestions with difficult wordings\n\nAsking vague, complex or ambiguous questions\n\nOverloading respondents with too many questions at once\n\nUsing double negative in your questions\n\nWhen building your survey, frame your questions carefully. Guide users to answer questions, without imposing any expectations on them.\n\n2. Send feedback contextually\n\nSending feedback contextually means your CSAT survey appears when it is relevant to a specific touchpoint in a customer’s journey. This could be after a customer completes a specific action you’re collecting feedback on or after they pass a new milestone. This real-time approach captures fresh, unfiltered customer opinions, providing more reliable data.\n\nAt Sprout, we use microsurveys at different customer touchpoints to collect feedback contextually. For instance, you’d typically find microsurveys placed after our customer support articles and as you use our product in-app.\n\nThis feedback is more effective and actionable because it directly relates to a specific experience, making it easier for our team to understand and act on it meaningfully.\n\n3. Set appropriate goals for your CSAT\n\nSince customer satisfaction (CSAT) is not as evident to stakeholders as customer acquisition, it’s often overlooked when it comes to setting goals. Creating CSAT goals is the first step to successful goal achievement. It gives your team a sense of direction and aligns your team’s actions with your business goals.\n\nA couple of goals you might consider setting include:\n\nIncreasing your CSAT score by a certain percentage by the end of the quarter\n\nReducing churn and increasing customer retention by a certain percentage by the end of the year\n\n4. Create a support omnichannel\n\nImplementing a seamless customer support system across various communication channels can significantly improve customer satisfaction. Customers expect a fast response from your support team regardless of the channel they contact for assistance.\n\nWant to create an Omnichannel support experience? Here’s what it involves:\n\nIntegrate multiple support channels like email, phone calls and social media chat to access customer data across all channels.\n\nUse customer data to personalize interactions and create an omnichannel customer experience\n\nImprove your issue resolution time by equipping your customer support agents with the right tools.\n\nClose the feedback loop by implementing feedback requests and updating the customers afterward.\n\nInvest in an advanced tool like Sprout Social to have a centralized view of your customer data.\n\n5. Use feedback to improve your product or service\n\nKnowing your CSAT score and collecting customer feedback will do no good if you don’t act on it. Feedback reveals what you’re doing right, product weaknesses and areas for improvement. This allows you to adjust your product expectations and fine-tune your customer experience strategy going forward.\n\nAfter gathering feedback, analyze it for insights. Look for patterns, trends, opportunities and gaps your team may have overlooked. Tools like Sprout’s customer feedback report are used to organize, filter and categorize feedback by user segments.\n\nPrioritize feedback that requires immediate action (e.g., bug fixes) and act on it. Categorize other feedback based on alignment with your current business goals, available resources and priorities. Include all these in a product roadmap for further research or validation in future development.\n\n6. Reduce response times\n\nSlow support response times can result in companies losing the trust and loyalty of their customers. Customers are highly impatient, and a slow response time comes with the consequence of a poor satisfaction score. In our 2022 Sprout Social Index, we discovered that customers expect quick responses: 40% within the first hour on social and 79% within the first 24 hours.\n\nTo speed up response time, offer self-service options like a resource center with FAQs, videos and chatbots. Brands use Sprout Social’s Bot Builder to automate their conversational workflow on social. Using Sprout’s Bot Builder for customer service, you can build a chatbot, preview it and then deploy it within minutes.\n\n7. Address negative feedback\n\nReceiving negative feedback is not easy for anyone. It can make us defensive, frustrated or angry. As a brand, receiving negative feedback is inevitable, no matter how hard you try to please your customers. These reviews can come from social media comments, review sites or even your CSAT surveys.\n\nWhen you receive a negative review, don’t get defensive; negative feedback is not a personal attack on you or your brand. Listen carefully to the customer’s complaint and understand what happened and why it happened. Then, reach out to the customer and take responsibility. This can be done through email or by handling your feedback through Sprout.\n\nSprout’s Smart Inbox brings together comments and messages from multiple social media platforms into a single dashboard so you can monitor, view and respond to customers. What’s more, you can also monitor your notifications and brand mentions to catch negative feedback.\n\n8. Measure your CSAT score regularly\n\nMeasuring your CSAT is not a one-time thing; it’s continuous. As you would measure and set financial goals for your brand, also set goals for improving your CSAT on a bi-monthly, quarterly or annual basis. Create a roadmap for the long run and set measures to:\n\nReview your CSAT and come up with better means for distribution (e.g., in-app, email, knowledgebase articles, etc.)\n\nCompare past and present CSAT scores to get an overview of current changes\n\nSet up one-on-one interviews with power users and churned users to find out your strengths and weaknesses.\n\nDocument previous actions and their effectiveness on your CSAT score (e.g. Did adding more support channels improve our CSAT score? )\n\nCreate a customer service report to document your process and results.\n\nUse CSAT to improve your customer satisfaction\n\nWhile exceeding customer satisfaction is the end-goal, sending out surveys, analyzing the results and finding patterns in your customer satisfaction score is extremely stressful, especially if you have a growing customer base. You need the right tool to automate this task so you can focus on achieving other important tasks in your business.",

      "# [What is Doomscrolling? on 2022-07-06](https://sproutsocial.com/glossary/doomscrolling/)\nThere are nearly 5 billion social media users around the world! Yes, you read that correctly. Social media has become one of the most influential methods of communication for people of all generations.\n\nWhile there are many benefits to social media, inevitable downsides have also emerged. One such negative is doomscrolling.\n\nWhat Is Doomscrolling?\n\nHave you found yourself consistently reading negative articles or posts on social networks? This is called doomscrolling.\n\nDoomscrolling is when one decides to read depressing content and does not even notice that they continue to read such content.\n\nThe term doomscrolling has been around for a while but has increased in popularity due to traumatic events like the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe psychological effects of doomscrolling\n\nDoomscrolling can cause people to compare themselves to others more than ever. This creates unobtainable, unfair and intimidating social standards.\n\nIn turn, social media users of all ages and backgrounds have begun to feel undeniable pressure. Younger people especially pre-teens, teenagers, and individuals in their 20s and 30s can become more depressed and lonely due to doomscrolling.\n\nWhy does doomscrolling occur?\n\nResearch has suggested that people doomscroll as a means of control. There is so much in this world that one cannot control, but when and why they acquire knowledge is one such thing that is controllable.\n\nPeople believe the more educated they are, the better prepared they will be for dire situations. What they do not recognize is that doomscrolling negatively affects their mental state. Consistent depressing news will of course result in negative emotions and feelings.\n\nEliminating your doomscrolling will improve your overall mental wellbeing. The good news is there are steps you can take to ween yourself off this unhealthy habit.\n\nHow to stop doomscrolling?\n\nOne of the first steps you can take to improve your doom surfing is to carefully select your sources. Chose a source you trust and a source that has a positive reputation.\n\nThe sources you use must be factual, but they also should not have a negative bias. Often, major sources write articles with a negative lens as a scare factor.\n\nWhen searching the web, limit your screen time. Allow yourself a specific amount of time to read the content you desire and then force yourself to move on to a different activity. This will take discipline, but it’s worth your while.\n\nWhen reviewing content on the web, place effort into selecting more upbeat content. You control what you view. Reading more positive articles or watching uplifting content can make a world of difference.\n\nCreate more responsible content\n\nSince doomscrolling can have such an effect on your mental state, it is imperative that you are proactive and take steps to limit or eliminate this behavior.\n\nCompanies can create engaging and positive content with Sprout Social. When businesses create meaningful content with good intentions, people can be exposed to healthier content.",
      "# [What is BeReal? on 2022-04-29](https://sproutsocial.com/glossary/bereal/)\nBeReal is a photo-sharing application that allows users to post one photo per day to show their followers what they are doing in real-time. The BeReal app focuses on authenticity and asks users to be real. Because the app allows everyone to post only once a day, users can avoid being on the application for multiple hours throughout the day, making the app stand out from social media platforms currently dominant in the space.\n\nWhat is BeReal?\n\nThe social media application available for download on Android and IOS devices was founded in December 2019 by Alexis Barreyat. The app encourages users to share who they are in the moment. The app is the latest trending social media application that is quickly growing in interest and downloads.\n\nHow does the BeReal app work?\n\nUsers receive a notification at a random time once a day saying ‘Time to BeReal’. This opens up a two-minute window for the user to post a picture of what they are currently doing. The purpose of this is to capture an authentic, unfiltered snapshot of a user’s life.\n\nIf users post outside of the two-minute window, they will be considered late and will not be able to see others’ photo until after they’ve posted. After posting, users will also gain access to the app’s Discover section.\n\nUsers can retake their photos, however, the app will show the number of times a user retakes an image. The app also reveals the number of times the user tried to capture their BeReal moment.\n\nWhile there is not a ‘like’ option available on the app, users can react to other posts by using their RealMoji, or an emoji featuring their selfie mimicking an emoji reaction. The app has no filters or edit buttons and does not allow videos to be posted. Follower count is also not displayed on the app and neither are ads.",

Publish your reviews to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and your website.\n\nSponsor posts: Seek out bloggers with impact in your industry and pay for them to write a blog or article relevant to your space. This is a less labor-intensive way to work with influencers.\n\nGuest posts: Ask people to write on your website, or request to place a piece of content on their site instead. This helps to boost brand reach.\n\nUsing an influencer marketing platform can make the process of identifying influencers, managing campaigns, and tracking performance smooth and efficient, taking your strategy to the next level.\n\nThe benefits of working with influencers\n\nInfluencers are valuable because they offer instant access to the credibility a growing company needs. 70% of millennials are influenced by recommendations from their peers. Influencers provide a connection point between companies and their target market. Working with an influencer:",
      "# [What is a meme? on 2018-10-15](https://sproutsocial.com/glossary/meme/)\nMemes and social media are perfect for each other.\n\nBoth concepts are about connecting with people online. While social media is a platform for communication, memes are a way of expressing a culturally-relevant idea. A meme is an image or video that represents the thoughts and feelings of a specific audience.\n\nMost memes are captioned photos intended to elicit humor. However, there are many viral video memes too.\n\nMemes are a worldwide social phenomenon, and an increasingly important aspect of viral marketing and social engagement. Memes often relate to existing cultures or subcultures. Often, memes spread rapidly through social media, email, and forum boards.\n\nWhere Does the Word “Meme” Come From?\n\nThe term “meme” was coined by Richard Dawkins, a biologist. Dawkins believed that cultural ideas are like genes. He thought that our concepts as a society spread from brain to brain, multiplying and mutating as they went. The resulting trends were his definition of a “meme.”\n\nMost modern “memes” are cultural inside jokes. They’re a way of connecting with people across the internet through unique photos that become instantly recognizable. Memes collect emotions, ideas and actions into an easy-to-translate format. Memes are ideal for the digital age.\n\nThe Benefits of Memes for Brands\n\nThough memes are popular in the consumer world, they’re also powerful for companies too. Companies use memes to:\n\nShare information in a fun and memorable format.\n\nHumanize your brand through a demonstration of personality.\n\nShowcase complicated concepts like company culture uniquely.\n\nObtain higher engagement with their audience.\n\nWhy Marketers are Using Memes\n\nMost internet users spend around 100 minutes a day on social media. Most of our conversations today are informed by the jokes and references made online. Whether it’s a picture from a social influencer or a video from a brand, memes are affecting the language that customers speak online. This means that brands need to learn how to translate their advertising for this new world.\n\nMemes elicit better reactions from audiences because they’re tailored for social media. People naturally share memes as part of their online experience, so they’re a great way to improve engagement.\n\nHow to Use Memes on Social Media\n\nBrands using memes on social media need a strategy.\n\nLike any other social marketing plan, posting memes must be a measured and audience-specific process. Remember to:",

It also shows benchmarking and has a good Instagram competitor benchmarking (although I wish they had this for all platforms!) \n\nI don't like the main post crafting section compared to sprout social or loomly. This is because you can't adjust the post to fit with different platform requirements. So you'd have to either create one post to all platforms and not have it adjusted for each platform (tags, hashtags, character limit etc). OR create the same post 3 or 4 times over for different platforms.\n\nWith other tools I've used you can individually tweak within the one post.

Are you an individual looking to manage a few accounts yourself, or do you need a solution for collaborating with a team? Do you need robust analytics and reporting, or is basic scheduling and publishing sufficient? Answering these types of questions will help narrow down the best fit.  \nA few tools that I've used personally and would recommend based on different scenarios include:  \n1. For individuals or solopreneurs on a budget, Buffer is a great free option that allows scheduling posts in advance to multiple networks. It has all the essential features one needs without a steep learning curve.  \n2. SocialPilot provides a good balance of features and affordability for small businesses looking for more functionality. Things like content curation, analytics, and team collaboration are included in their pricing plans.  \n3. Hootsuite would serve larger companies that need enterprise-level support well. They offer high-volume account management, advanced analytics, and 24/7 support to meet the needs of large marketing teams.  \nNo matter which tool you choose, take advantage of free trials to test the features for yourself before committing. And remember, consistent posting, engaging content, and listening to your audience - those human elements are just as crucial for success on social media as any tool.\n\n### Comment ID l424pxw with +1 score by [(Apprehensive_Salad47, Reddit, 2024-05-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialMediaMarketing/comments/16h0qx6/what_social_management_tool_do_you_use_and/l424pxw/) (in reply to ID k0efmk0):\n\\^\\^\\^ we can all plug stuff into AI text generators ourselves but thanks anyway!\n\n## Comment ID k0fdtt3 with +1 score by [(makedas, Reddit, 2023-09-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialMediaMarketing/comments/16h0qx6/what_social_management_tool_do_you_use_and/k0fdtt3/) (in reply to ID 16h0qx6):\nI’ve used Later & SproutSocial for jobs but have just switched to Pallyy for client work because it’s really affordable!

The primary reason for switching is that when it comes to posting content, it's unbeatable.\n\nBuffer is a product that is great if your team is OK with using multiple tools to service a client's social media marketing needs.  The API and integrations make this an excellent tool if you've got some tech skills to use the data they collect to create reports yourself.  Of course there are product like DashThis that fill that gap if you aren't a coder.\n\nIf you want a one size fits all tool to manage posting,  social mentions, etc.. in one interface,  Sprout is your solution.  In fact I greatly miss the Inbox that would collect all the social mentions into one place.  I have yet to find a replacement for that feature.\n\nIf you want a rock solid posting tool and a way to manage your evergreen content for near automated re-promotion, go with Buffer.  \n\nAnd, yes; the price is a factor.  I asked Sprout for 5 more profiles and they quoted me a laughable amount.  Not figuratively, literally laughably expensive.\n\nIf you do go with Buffer,  augment it with something like Mention.net and DashThis.\n\n## Comment ID d42t065 with +3 score by [(melissadingmon, Reddit, 2016-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/4ncqdc/buffer_v_sprout_social/d42t065/) (in reply to ID 4ncqdc):\n\"Hootsuite is garbage\" = upvote.\n\n## Comment ID d42w60z with +2 score by [(SproutRachael, Reddit, 2016-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/4ncqdc/buffer_v_sprout_social/d42w60z/) (in reply to ID 4ncqdc):\nHey, Megan.

I think a lot of this depends on how you use social media. If social activity has to show a solid ROI then you need a tool that does the analytics and tagging well, if it's a publisher then speed and ease of use will be a big factor, if it's for customer service then you need something that can integrate with CRM and also allow assignment to team members.

Sprinklr beats all those options hands down. It offers power years beyond what any of them will be able to develop in the next 5.\n\nSprout looks nice and has pretty reports but it's nowhere in the same realm as Sprinklr when it comes to offering for large enterprise.\n\nWe have more than 1200 company accounts and over 10k employees managing their social presences through Sprinkler. You simply can't do that with Buffer, HootSuite, or Sprout.\n\nWhile I use Buffer constantly each day for managing a couple dozen personal and business accounts and have a Sprout account they provide for me which I use from time to time, there's no question which route I'd go if I was managing a large social project. Though if you're just a small agency with a couple clients and small social programs, I can see how Sprinklr may be too much. It's for enterprise social while the others aren't. Really an apples to oranges.\n\n#### Comment ID d43y72z with +1 score by [(b00mtown, Reddit, 2016-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/4ncqdc/buffer_v_sprout_social/d43y72z/) (in reply to ID d434zhk):\nI am at a medium creative agency with international clients. As a one person social department you have totally hit the nail on the head. Sprinklr represents the hopes and dreams of my client, which has thousands of locations worldwide that they someday hope to have all connected through the platform. In the very long meantime I am stuck running a motocross race in a dump truck. \n\nI am impressed with Sprinklr in a lot of ways, but running point on engagement makes the terrible UI stand out. Once the client realizes they need an internal team to start managing some of their social, it will get better and I will probably enjoy using Sprinklr more. \n\nThat being said, I have run very large scale social projects with Sprinklr in the past (another agency, tool dictated by clients) and Sprinklr has absolutely shit the bed on me. Reps promised what they couldn't deliver and in the 11th hour I had to rely on other tools. \n\nSprinklr is a great tool for client side social depts. I think agencies who really want to build out social should rely on a constellation of tools to get the best product. All tools promise a one-stop shop and all tools are awful at at least 1 thing (if not more). Sprinklr is no exception. \n\nEDIT: I should add that this is how I feel. This is my opinion. People can second guess my agency's roster, experience, my inability to learn/use the tool etc. but at the end of the day when I log in to the desktop or app, I am not impressed with how the tool functions or the choices Sprinklr has made.\n\n### Comment ID d435wtq with +1 score by [(PotatoFirelord, Reddit, 2016-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/4ncqdc/buffer_v_sprout_social/d435wtq/) (in reply to ID d42xto1):\nI'm also curious to know what you dont like about Sprinklr.

My org and team is moving back to Sprout Social for social media moderation. I am curious on anyone’s experience using their Chatbot feature and workflows/processes you have. I am planning on utilizing it for our own accounts and it seems pretty useful. But, my business usually co-markets for workforce development programs and I am still working through potential use cases. My current plan is to turn on a program specific chatbot when those programs are actively being advertised on our partner’s Facebook pages. The chatbot will link them to our tech issue form/ticketing system, program FAQ page, and allow them to connect with a Human. I am a little confused how I would implement with the partners other needs in mind. For example, we work with hospital systems and I don’t want to hinder other normal content DMs.\n\nI appreciate any insight on your experience, uses, and my current idea. It’s just me moderating for multiple campaigns and it gets hectic! Trying to make my life a tad easier and curtail having to answer tedious questions. \n\nEDIT: typo\n\n\n\n## Comment ID l01b62l with +1 score by [(legit4u, Reddit, 2024-04-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/1c6igqw/sprout_social_bot_uses/l01b62l/) (in reply to ID 1c6igqw):\nIf you are looking into a lot of chatbot type things, I'd look at Voiceflow - it's their speciality vs Sprout.

Best I can say is to occasionally disconnect and reconnect the profiles (as long as you don’t have TONS scheduled since it will remove those posts once disconnected.) Also, Meta tends to flag third party scheduling platforms which is SO annoying. Just a couple of weeks ago we had to wait a week to get access to several client accounts because they had been deactivated. All Meta had to say was “be careful using third party software.” 🤦\n\n### Comment ID kbbj0zx with +1 score by [(Due-Candidate, Reddit, 2023-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialMediaMarketing/comments/186c0ef/rejected_sprout_posts_on_instagram/kbbj0zx/) (in reply to ID kbao14r):\nThanks for replying. We had several Sprout initiated reconnects with no result, and then a long stretch of replies promising to \"keep us updated\" while they worked with Meta. After over 2 weeks of nothing, including a weird interaction with Meta support where the ticket came back as \"This post was removed, and this issue is resolved.\" with no post referenced, I went into Meta Business and disconnected and reconnected the Instagram account there. It changed nothing display-wise, but our posting started working again. And Sprout reminded us about their no refunds policy regarding API issues.   \n\n\nTwo weeks ago, someone could have suggested what I did this morning. The layers on Meta Business or deep - I wouldn't have tried it without digging in desperation, but I would have tried it immediately with the simple suggestion from the support team. A little disappointing.

The free account is somewhat limited, but you can upgrade to pro for something like $7 a month. It's certainly a worthwhile investment if you're serious about pursuing this as a career. I still use it for my personal dashboard even though my company switched over to radian6, Sprout, and Brandwatch.\n\nSprout analytics are nothing fancy. All they do is pull the data straight from Facebook insights, so it's nothing you can't find yourself. Their Twitter stats are mostly guess-work, as they are looking for information that Twitter doesn't really provide accurately (age, gender, location, etc.). You can manually count engagement, or use Hootsuite to track it.\n\nAll in all, Sprout isn't everything it's cracked up to be. Most CMs I know prefer Hootsuite, Tweetdeck, or a combination of the above.\n\n## Comment ID cbh9dsr with +1 score by [(wonderfulsocial, Reddit, 2013-08-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/1jqe7w/a_free_alternative_to_sprout_social/cbh9dsr/) (in reply to ID 1jqe7w):\nWhat channels?\n\n### Comment ID cbh9pod with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2013-08-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/1jqe7w/a_free_alternative_to_sprout_social/cbh9pod/) (in reply to ID cbh9dsr):\nfacebook for ads and principal engaging.

Avoid overloading the security team with tasks that fall outside their primary function. This will help maintain focus and improve efficiency.\n\nValue Operational Work: Recognize and reward the importance of day-to-day operational tasks in maintaining a secure environment. Balanced acknowledgment of both project and operational contributions can lead to a more motivated and satisfied team.\n\nImplement a Feasible Deadline Approach: Re-evaluate the approach to setting project deadlines to ensure they are realistic and achievable. This will not only improve work quality but also reduce undue stress and burnout among team members.\n\nRevise Compensation Strategies Company Wide: Consider reviewing and restructuring the compensation and benefits package company wide. Sprout can be an enjoyable place to work, but that is not a replacement for competitive pay. Whatever sources you're using to determine competitive pay are very inaccurate. Competitive salaries and meaningful raises are crucial in retaining talent and showing appreciation for your employees' hard work and dedication.\n\nFoster Open Communication: Encourage a culture where feedback from all levels is genuinely considered and acted upon. This will not only empower your employees but also provide valuable insights for better decision-making at the management level.\n\nPromote Career Development: Offer more opportunities for professional growth and development. This includes providing clear pathways for advancement, as well as opportunities for training and upskilling.",

However, paradoxically, these contributions and suggestions are frequently overruled or ignored, creating a frustrating cycle of expectation without empowerment.\n\n - Unrealistic Deadlines: Projects within the security team are often saddled with impractical timelines. This leads to increased pressure and missed deadlines, without any ownership from leadership over their own role in this.\n\n - Undervaluation of Operational Work: Day-to-day operational tasks are consistently undervalued, with an excessive focus on project work. This approach overlooks the importance of maintaining and improving regular security operations.\n\n - Inexperienced Leadership: The security leadership team lacks significant experience outside of Sprout Social. This sometimes contributes to a narrow perspective on how a typical security team should function, hindering the team's effectiveness and growth.\n\n - Role Confusion: Leadership often volunteers the security team for non-security related tasks, leading to role confusion and a dilution of the team's primary focus. There is a bizarre sense of what provides value and what doesn't, and actual security seems to be at the bottom of the list of what provides value.\n\n - Misaligned Roles: A noticeable portion of the security team functions more as system administrators rather than as dedicated security engineers, which could impact the overall security posture.\n\n - Compensation Concerns: The salary structure is disappointing. Pay increases, including those for promotions, are minimal and fail to match inflation rates, let alone provide a sense of real financial progression. This approach does not demonstrate a commitment to retaining talent.\n\n - Average Benefits: The benefits package is average, lacking standout features that might compensate for other shortcomings in the compensation and work environment.",

You may get a stock grant, but it's just a millstone to keep working for a company that doesn't care about you. \n\nAfter a change in Marketing leadership, a decline in employee engagement, and general attrition throughout the year, there were promises made that things would get better. That management would take employee feedback seriously and implement change. \n\nThe single change was an update to the career bands structure, which is actually worse than it was before. There's no longer a competency for bringing 'business value'. The emphasis is much more on communication and collaboration, which is incredibly challenging at a company with so much organizational debt that getting anything done requires moving mountains. With these new bands, any actual work that moved the company forward and drove revenue will slow as everyone ensures they don't step on anyone's toes and risk that promotion.\n\nThe only time where you can get any change in role and significant increase in salary is during the annual review (which is held each April, a solid 4 months after the year has ended). If you just come short, or if you get feedback you weren't expecting, prepare to wait 12 more months for any meaningful salary change.\n\nIt seems like they're doing as much as they can to not promote employees or give them additional compensation.

I appreciate the investment you’ve made in Sprout over the years, and I wanted you to know that I read your review and I hear you.\n\nWe value recognizing great work at Sprout. For that reason, all team members are evaluated at least once a year for merit increases, which are based on performance, market rate and time since last increase, as well as promotions, which are based on a combination of performance and business need. Quarterly Check-ins, which we just completed in July, are also dedicated time to discuss your performance and career development goals with your manager. \n\nThe refreshed Marketing career bands are designed to provide more clear and specific guidance based on industry and Sprout standards. Business impact is incorporated throughout the competencies, on which all team members were invited to provide feedback before they were finalized. Bands are just one part of career development, and we’re proud to have rolled out several new programs including Grow@Sprout professional development awards for conferences and courses, Marketing department-wide study groups on topics team members are most interested in, self-paced learning through our ANA sponsorship, and more.\n\nI encourage you to work with your manager on how the updated career bands apply to your role and the important business impact you make at Sprout. If those conversations aren’t feeling productive, please reach out to your People Business Partner—we’re invested in the growth of all Sprout employees and want to ensure you’re receiving regular feedback and coaching across the annual review, quarterly check-ins, and regular 1:1s.\n\nThanks again for taking the time to share your thoughts. I hope you’ll share this feedback with your manager or People Business Partner, so we have the chance to improve your experience at Sprout. I really do want you to see Sprout as a place where you can continue to grow your career.",

People are extremely entitled and more and more enabled to behave like corporate bullies. Even people I once considered friends are showing me sides of themselves that shock me. This probably is due to the fact that our leadership team feels very absent, so to make up for it, people really are trying to prove their place and pave the way for their own success, or they're so stressed they're taking it out on others. It's become a \"what's in it for me\" culture. The things that drew me to the company years ago are gone. I understand change is inevitable and I support change in general, but these issues are cracks in our very DNA, not just a byproduct of being a larger and more international team moving at quick speeds. There's no accountability and now it feels often like we're running in circles.\n\nPay is also extremely low. When I talk to peers outside Sprout, but in the exact same role, they're all getting at least 30% higher base pay, have better benefits, and earn cash bonuses. Leadership has been challenged on staying competitive with compensation again and again, and look the other way. RSUs that vest in a few years are not enough in this economy, especially when stock prices aren't guaranteed and are influenced by outside factors we have no control over. My bills continue to increase but I won't ever get a penny more in salary until I'm promoted, and even then it'll be a small bump. Overall, the company feels really cheap and like it's a pain to spend any money for needs the team has.",

There's always this pressure to meet metrics and when you mention you feel burnt out, they tell you to have a \"growth mindset\". Whenever there are company events or R&amp;R days, you can't actually take advantage of that because someone has to be scheduled to work to meet these impossible goals/metrics. You're expected to be a team player and say yes to increasing tasks or schedule changes, even if your workload is heavy. This adds onto more pressure and if you try to set boundaries (like they encourage), you're given negative feedback. After some turnover of more tenured employees (which is telling), it felt like nothing was done to boost team morale and we were still held to an impossibly high standard.

Avoid overloading the security team with tasks that fall outside their primary function. This will help maintain focus and improve efficiency.\n\nValue Operational Work: Recognize and reward the importance of day-to-day operational tasks in maintaining a secure environment. Balanced acknowledgment of both project and operational contributions can lead to a more motivated and satisfied team.\n\nImplement a Feasible Deadline Approach: Re-evaluate the approach to setting project deadlines to ensure they are realistic and achievable. This will not only improve work quality but also reduce undue stress and burnout among team members.\n\nRevise Compensation Strategies Company Wide: Consider reviewing and restructuring the compensation and benefits package company wide. Sprout can be an enjoyable place to work, but that is not a replacement for competitive pay. Whatever sources you're using to determine competitive pay are very inaccurate. Competitive salaries and meaningful raises are crucial in retaining talent and showing appreciation for your employees' hard work and dedication.\n\nFoster Open Communication: Encourage a culture where feedback from all levels is genuinely considered and acted upon. This will not only empower your employees but also provide valuable insights for better decision-making at the management level.\n\nPromote Career Development: Offer more opportunities for professional growth and development. This includes providing clear pathways for advancement, as well as opportunities for training and upskilling.",
        "cons": "Cons:\n\n- Directionless Security Leadership: The leadership within the security team lacks clear direction and often relies heavily on individual contributors to drive change. However, paradoxically, these contributions and suggestions are frequently overruled or ignored, creating a frustrating cycle of expectation without empowerment.\n\n - Unrealistic Deadlines: Projects within the security team are often saddled with impractical timelines. This leads to increased pressure and missed deadlines, without any ownership from leadership over their own role in this.\n\n - Undervaluation of Operational Work: Day-to-day operational tasks are consistently undervalued, with an excessive focus on project work. This approach overlooks the importance of maintaining and improving regular security operations.\n\n - Inexperienced Leadership: The security leadership team lacks significant experience outside of Sprout Social. This sometimes contributes to a narrow perspective on how a typical security team should function, hindering the team's effectiveness and growth.\n\n - Role Confusion: Leadership often volunteers the security team for non-security related tasks, leading to role confusion and a dilution of the team's primary focus. There is a bizarre sense of what provides value and what doesn't, and actual security seems to be at the bottom of the list of what provides value.\n\n - Misaligned Roles: A noticeable portion of the security team functions more as system administrators rather than as dedicated security engineers, which could impact the overall security posture.\n\n - Compensation Concerns: The salary structure is disappointing. Pay increases, including those for promotions, are minimal and fail to match inflation rates, let alone provide a sense of real financial progression. This approach does not demonstrate a commitment to retaining talent.\n\n - Average Benefits: The benefits package is average, lacking standout features that might compensate for other shortcomings in the compensation and work environment.",

People are extremely entitled and more and more enabled to behave like corporate bullies. Even people I once considered friends are showing me sides of themselves that shock me. This probably is due to the fact that our leadership team feels very absent, so to make up for it, people really are trying to prove their place and pave the way for their own success, or they're so stressed they're taking it out on others. It's become a \"what's in it for me\" culture. The things that drew me to the company years ago are gone. I understand change is inevitable and I support change in general, but these issues are cracks in our very DNA, not just a byproduct of being a larger and more international team moving at quick speeds. There's no accountability and now it feels often like we're running in circles.\n\nPay is also extremely low. When I talk to peers outside Sprout, but in the exact same role, they're all getting at least 30% higher base pay, have better benefits, and earn cash bonuses. Leadership has been challenged on staying competitive with compensation again and again, and look the other way. RSUs that vest in a few years are not enough in this economy, especially when stock prices aren't guaranteed and are influenced by outside factors we have no control over. My bills continue to increase but I won't ever get a penny more in salary until I'm promoted, and even then it'll be a small bump.

This data helps you tailor your marketing strategies to boost engagement and ROI.\n\nStats can also help you benchmark your own performance within your industry and even uncover new opportunities.\n\nUse the social media marketing statistics below to guide your presence in 2024 and beyond.\n\nSocial media usage statistics\n\nIt’s no secret that we’re all glued to social media (my screen time data supports this). To get a better idea of how glued users are, let's look at some social media usage statistics.\n\nBelow is a quick snapshot of how social media demographics and usage are changing, which networks are winning and how hooked consumers are on social.\n\nIn 2024, there are estimated to be 5.17 billion total social media users worldwide.\n\nThe average person uses 6.7 different social networks per month.\n\nThe amount of time internet users spend on social media declined slightly to 143 minutes per day.\n\nTikTok is the fastest-growing platform with a staggering 100% user growth rate between 2020 and 2022. And between Q3 2022 and Q3 2023, TikTok's monthly active users grew 13%.\n\nThe number of social media users worldwide grew by 320 million people from January 2023 to January 2024.\n\nGrowth may seem slow, but that's due to the sheer number of people who already use social media. This means social media presents a huge opportunity for marketers and advertisers.\n\nHowever, with users spread across several platforms, it’s more important than ever for brands to take a multi-channel approach. Don't forget to leverage emerging platforms like TikTok to reach new audiences and stand out from the competition.\n\nSocial media advertising statistics\n\nAs organic reach decreases on nearly every platform, paid social media advertising becomes a must-use strategy for reaching your target audience. Learn more about social advertising stats to inform your strategy.\n\nTotal spend on social media advertising is projected to reach $219.8 billion in 2024.\n\nIt's now projected that $255.8 billion of total social media ad spending will be generated through mobile by 2028.\n\nTotal ad spend growth is anticipated at 6.1% in 2024.\n\nSocial media ads account for 28.8% of all digital advertising spend.\n\nBusinesses put around 8.7% of their total revenue towards their ads budget.\n\nSocial media ad spend is growing at a steady rate. With more marketers investing in ads, brands should get ready to allocate bigger budgets to paid marketing strategies to compete.\n\nFacebook statistics\n\nFacebook remains an advertising powerhouse. Whether or not brands should focus on Facebook is a tough question that really depends on your individual Facebook metrics. The following Facebook statistics can clue you in further.\n\nFacebook is the most-used platform by marketers worldwide (89%). Instagram sits in second place (80%).\n\nAs of Q3 2023, Facebook is the largest online social network in the world with roughly 3.05 billion monthly active users.\n\nThe average American spends about 31 minutes per day on Facebook.\n\n56.3% of Facebook users are male and 43.7% are female (based on available gender data).\n\nAlmost a quarter of Facebook users in the US are between the ages 25-34.\n\nFacebook remains a favorite among marketers. That’s not surprising, considering the massive reach offered by the platform. Plus, the increasing average age means more users are in high-level, decision-making positions in their careers.\n\nInstagram statistics\n\nInstagram boasts 2 billion actively monthly users and yet brands are still scrambling to get more Instagram followers. Below are the top social media statistics for Instagram.\n\nInstagram ties with Facebook for the social media platform with the highest ROI.\n\n27.4% of US Instagram users are between 25 and 34 years old.\n\n61.1% of total Instagram users worldwide are between the ages 18-34, and mostly identify as male.\n\nInstagram Reels generate more likes and saves, but fewer comments than regular posts.\n\nInstagram’s engagement rates are four times higher than Facebook (0.60% to 0.15%), but engagement has become more competitive each year.\n\nIn 2023, 43% of marketers plan to increase their investment in Instagram.\n\nOnce the go-to social platform for influencers, Instagram is facing competition from TikTok.\n\nStill, relatively high engagement rates, fresh ecommerce features and big ad spending signal that the future is still bright for Instagram.\n\nLinkedIn statistics\n\nLinkedIn has done a brilliant job of carving out its niche as the go-to professional network. The platform is a potential goldmine for B2B brands and the rapid growth of their ad platform speaks for itself. Here are some LinkedIn statistics you should know.\n\nThere are more than more than 1 billion members across 200 countries on LinkedIn.\n\nThe United States has the highest user rate in the world on LinkedIn with an audience reach of over 214 million users.\n\nThere are over 67 million company profiles on LinkedIn.\n\n60% of worldwide users are between ages 25 and 34 years old, far exceeding any other age group.\n\nSpurred by the widespread career changes over the past two years, the platform doesn’t look to slow down any time soon. Hint: now’s the time to level up your LinkedIn marketing if you’re in B2B.\n\nPinterest statistics\n\nPinterest often doesn’t get its due when it comes to social platforms. The platform’s diverse, big-spending audience is among the most dedicated and engaged of any network. Here are some top Pinterest statistics to look out for.\n\n482 million people use Pinterest every month.\n\n76.2% of Pinterest users are women, 17.2% are men and 6.6% are unspecified.\n\nIn December 2023 alone, nearly 1.2 billion visits were measured to Pinterest.com, from desktop and mobile.\n\n76.2% of worldwide Pinterest users identify as female.\n\nPinterest is the third-most visited social media website in the US.\n\n80% of weekly users have found a new brand or product on the platform.\n\nThe power of Pinterest advertising is well-documented and the platform is the perfect place to uncover new products. Also, marketers targeting a US audience would do well to include Pinterest in their marketing efforts.\n\nTikTok statistics\n\nTikTok has totally transformed itself to a must-have digital platform for brands. The platform’s rabid fanbase, rapid growth and sky-high usage spell great news for early adopters. Below are some interesting TikTok statistics to know about.\n\nTikTok is expected to reach over 2 billion users in 2024.\n\nTikTok is the most frequently used app worldwide, with Android phone users spending an average of 34 hours per month on the platform.\n\nTikTok’s user base skews female, with 48% of users identifying as women (based on available gender data.)\n\n36.7% of TikTok users are 18-24 years old and account for the largest share of TikTok’s advertising audience.\n\nTikTok is the second-most used video entertainment app by monthly active users.\n\nYounger consumers and smaller influencers dominate the platform right now, but that may change in the very near future. If you’re already on the platform, make sure to watch your TikTok analytics and how to reach your audience ASAP.\n\nX (formerly Twitter) statistics\n\nX, formerly Twitter, has cemented itself as the hub of political discussions, memes and a prime place to go back and forth with brands.

Here are the top YouTube statistics to know about.\n\nAs of January 2023, YouTube has nearly 2.5 billion users worldwide.\n\nYouTube Shorts has 2 billion monthly active users.\n\nYouTube's biggest gender segments are males aged between 25-34 (12.2%), and males aged between 35-44 (9.6%) (based on available gender data).\n\nYouTube users spend an average of 28 hours, 5 minutes on the Android app each month.\n\nNearly 90% of all visits to YouTube come from a mobile device.\n\nDespite the platforms in the market, YouTube is still users’ go-to video-sharing and video-consumption platform. With more people accessing the app on mobile, marketers would benefit from posting more short-form, vertical content (i.e. Shorts) on the platform.\n\nSocial media video statistics\n\nVideo continues to be an all-time favorite content type. It’s versatile, engaging and offers excellent ROI to marketers worldwide. Let’s look at some recent social media video statistics.\n\n44% of people prefer to learn about a new product or service via short video content.\n\n87% of marketers say video marketing has directly increased sales.\n\nShort-form video offers marketers the highest ROI of any social media marketing strategy, with 30-60 videos seeing the most success.\n\nUS video advertising is expected to increase from $76.97 billion in 2023 to $84.61 billion in 2024.\n\nVideo is making its way into all types of marketing strategies in virtually every industry. However, it’s evolving in its shape and form. Brands can expect to see better results from short-form video content that’s primarily entertaining and/or funny.\n\nInfluencer marketing statistics\n\nWorking with influencers is one of the best inbound marketing strategies being used today. Here are some influencer marketing statistics about which platforms marketers are leveraging, what they’re hoping to achieve and how they plan to execute influencer marketing in the future.\n\n50.1% of marketers believe TikTok offers the highest ROI to influencer marketers for short-form video content, followed by 29.9% of marketers saying Instagram Reels and 12% saying YouTube Shorts.\n\n69% of marketers use TikTok for influencer marketing, making it the most popular influencer marketing channel.\n\nGenerating more engagement, reaching new audiences and strengthening community are the top three marketing goals for working with creators.\n\n60% of marketers plan to spend more on influencer marketing campaigns in 2024.\n\n63% of marketers plan to use AI in launching their influencer campaigns. And 55% of these brands will use AI for identifying influencers.\n\nMore marketers are realizing the potential of influencer marketing. If influencers are not already part of your marketing efforts, it’s time to switch your focus. The key is to pick the best platforms and influencers for your brand, both of which can be automated using the right tools.\n\nConsumer behavior statistics\n\nThe concept of buying something you saw on social media is nothing new. From product recommendations to first impressions from brands, the impact of social media on consumers is well-documented.

Facebook is followed by YouTube (2.94 billion users), WhatsApp and Instagram (tied at 2 billion users).\n\nIs social media use increasing?\n\nSocial media use is increasing year-over-year, albeit slowly.

Or if you should keep investing in Facebook ads? Staying on top of the latest Facebook statistics will give you the insights you need to update your Facebook marketing strategy.\n\nEven after all this time, Facebook continues to be the most popular social media platform with the largest user base across all platforms. Understanding statistics around its usage, demographics, marketing uses and more can help inform your marketing strategy.\n\nSo without further ado, let’s dig in.\n\nTop 3 Facebook stats every marketer should know\n\nFacebook usage statistics\n\nFacebook user statistics\n\nFacebook audience and demographics statistics\n\nFacebook advertising and marketing statistics\n\nFacebook engagement statistics\n\nFacebook video statistics\n\nFacebook feature stats (Reels, Stories, Messenger)\n\nFacebook consumer behavior statistics\n\nTop 3 Facebook stats every marketer should know\n\nFacebook is the third most visited website following Google and YouTube, respectively. This puts it ahead of other leading platforms like Twitter and Instagram.\n\nThe platform boasts 3.065 billion active users on a monthly basis. This makes it the most used social media platform worldwide.\n\nIn 2023, Facebook’s total ad revenue amounted to $135 billion, up from $116 billion the previous year.\n\nFacebook usage statistics\n\nOver the years, Facebook has become almost synonymous with social media. It continues to be the biggest social media platform and is widely popular on a global scale. Here are some of the key Facebook usage statistics to understand its popularity and inform your Facebook marketing strategy:\n\n1. Facebook hit 3 billion monthly active users in 2023\n\nBy Q4 of 2023, monthly active users on the platform had grown to 3.065 billion after reaching the 3 billion user milestone in Q2 of 2023. Although adoption has slowed down, monthly usage is still seeing an upward trend. If your marketing efforts are also feeling stagnant, download our Facebook marketing template to reinvigorate your strategy.\n\n2. Americans spend about 30.9 minutes on the platform daily\n\nOn average, American users spend about 30.9 minutes on Facebook daily. This puts it ahead of other leading platforms such as X, Instagram and even TikTok. These numbers suggest that the platform is still seeing a high level of engagement from its user base.\n\nFacebook user statistics\n\nFacebook may have billions of users, but how are these people using the platform? Let’s look at a few vital Facebook user statistics to find out:\n\n3. Over two-third of all monthly users are active daily\n\nOut of the 3.065 billion monthly active users, 2.1 billion people use the platform daily. That’s 68.6% of users who spend at least some amount of time daily on the platform.\n\nIn other words, there are billions of people your brand could potentially reach every single day. The key is to get ahead of the Facebook algorithm so you can get more organic visibility.\n\n4. Facebook is the most popular site for people to get their news\n\nOut of U.S. adults who regularly look to social media for their news, 30% of them head to Facebook. This is ahead of YouTube (26%), Instagram (16%), TikTok (14%) and X (12%).\n\n5. Messaging friends and family is still the top activity on Facebook\n\nOver 72% of users say they use Facebook to message friends and family. This suggests that the platform’s “social” factor is still alive and kicking. Other popular activities on the platform are posting/sharing photos and videos (63.5%) and keeping up to date with news and events (58.7%).\n\nA significant number of users (54.3%) follow and research brands and products on Facebook. So although it’s mostly for social, your brand can still use the platform to build authentic connections.\n\n6. 59% of Facebook users have reached out to a brand on the platform\n\nSocial media is also commonly used for customer support requests. One survey found that 59% of Facebook users have reached out to a brand on the platform. Forty-six percent of those messages have been specifically in regards to customer care issues.\n\nEven though Facebook is a social network, it can still be a great outlet for providing customer support and improving experiences with your brand. In fact, 76% of consumers notice and appreciate when companies prioritize customer support, regardless of network.\n\nFacebook audience and demographics statistics\n\nWondering if you’re reaching the right audience on Facebook? What if your target demographic isn’t even on the platform? Here are a few Facebook stats highlighting the platform’s audience and demographics:\n\n7. Users ages 25-34 years represent Facebook’s largest audience\n\nDespite the platform’s reputation as a seemingly “older” network, 24.4% of Facebook users in the United States are between the ages of 25 and 34. Moreover, the platform sees higher usage among people below the age of 44.\n\n8. Usage among teens has dropped sharply\n\nThat said, the platform’s popularity among teens has seen a significant drop. Only 33% of teens were using Facebook as of 2023. This is a sharp decline compared to the 71% who were using the platform between 2014 and 2015.\n\n9. Facebook has more male-identifying users than female\n\nFacebook currently limits its reporting to male and female. And based on the data, the platform has a higher percentage of male users (56.3%) than female users (43.7%).\n\n10. India has the largest Facebook audience size\n\nWhile Facebook sees significant usage across various countries, India has the greatest number of users. Latest reports show that there are 314.6 million Facebook users in India. The United States comes next, with 175 million users.\n\nFacebook advertising and marketing statistics\n\nIs Facebook marketing still worth it? And are you getting the most out of your Facebook advertising strategy? Check out these Facebook ads statistics to understand advertising impact on the platform.\n\n11. Facebook ads see an average click-through rate (CTR) of 2.50%\n\nAccording to a WordStream study, Facebook ads get an average CTR of 2.50% across all industries for lead gen ads. That said, click-throughs vary for industries, with arts & entertainment, physicians & surgeons, real estate and sports & recreation sectors seeing a CTR of at least 3% and the travel industry hitting a CTR of over 6%.\n\nFacebook traffic ads and campaigns see a lower CTR, with the average rate being 1.51% across all industries. Arts & entertainment, real estate, restaurants & food and travel all see a CTR above 2%.\n\n12. Advertising for traffic campaigns on Facebook costs $0.83 per click\n\nThe same study found that the average cost per click (CPC) is $0.83 across all industries for traffic ads and $1.92 for lead gen ads. However, you can expect to pay much more in certain industries or campaign ads. For example, lead gen ads have a CPC of over $5 for attorneys and nearly $4 for dentists and physicians.\n\n13. The average conversion rate is 8.25% across industries\n\nFacebook sees a fairly high conversion rate for ads on the platform. On average, you can expect a conversion rate of about 8.25% for your Facebook ad. However, the specifics may vary depending on your industry. Arts & entertainment, dental services, industrial & commercial and real estate sectors see a significantly higher conversion rate.\n\n14. Facebook generates the highest ROI\n\nNeedless to say, with such high conversion rates and low CPC, marketing on Facebook yields high returns. In fact, Facebook generates the highest return on investment among all other social media platforms, tied only with Instagram at 29%.\n\nFacebook engagement statistics\n\nWith organic visibility on Facebook on the decline, it’s only natural to see a drop in engagement levels as well. But does this put Facebook at a disadvantage over other social media platforms? Here’s a quick look at some vital stats to understand where Facebook engagement:\n\n15. The median engagement rate on Facebook is 0.063%\n\nAccording to a RivalIQ study, brands see a median Facebook engagement rate of 0.063% across all industries. This puts Facebook as one of the less engaging social media platforms, beating only X/Twitter’s 0.029% engagement rate.\n\n16. Photo posts and status posts have the highest engagement\n\nThe power of visuals is still evident on Facebook, with photo posts getting the highest engagement at 0.10%. Video posts come next with an average engagement rate of 0.08%. Status posts perform fairly well with an average engagement rate of 0.06%. Link posts, on the other hand, are the worst for driving engagement. They see an average engagement rate of only 0.03%.\n\n17. Frequent posting doesn’t result in higher engagement\n\nContrary to popular belief, posting frequently doesn’t necessarily result in higher engagement. As the RivalIQ study points out, influencers and higher education industry see the greatest engagement compared to their posting frequency.\n\nInfluencers and higher education pages publish fewer than 10 posts per week. Meanwhile, media companies publish over 60 posts a week and only see an average engagement rate of 0.04%.\n\nRather than post frequency, post publishing should be a factor in your strategy. Know the best time to post on Facebook so you stand a better chance of driving engagement.\n\nFacebook video statistics\n\nAs video marketing continues to gain popularity, it’s important to be aware of how video performs on Facebook. Here are some key Facebook video statistics to inform your strategy:\n\n18. 50% of the time users spend on Facebook is spent watching videos\n\nAccording to Facebook’s own data, about half the time spent on Facebook (and Instagram) is watching video content. This means your audience likely watches video content on the app, and creating more video can help you reach more people. We’re created a quick guide on creating a successful social media video strategy, if you need a refresher.\n\n19. Vertical video with audio sees a 35% higher click-through rate\n\nFacebook Reels have been popular on the app since they were created and integrated into the app from Instagram. Facebook discovered that vertical video (Reels) with audio see a 35% higher CTR than other types of video content on the platform.\n\nFacebook feature stats (Reels, Stories, Messenger)\n\nSo, what sort of content should you post? What features are growing and what’s stagnant? Let’s review some Facebook stats that break down some of the platform’s key features, like Facebook Stories, Reels and Messenger:\n\n20. More than 500 million people use Stories every day\n\nAccording to internal Facebook data, half a billion people use Facebook Stories each day and more than 1 billion Stories shared every day across the Meta apps. This speaks to the popularity of the platform’s feature, making it a useful tool for brands to engage their audience.\n\n21. Facebook Messenger has nearly 1 billion users\n\nMeanwhile, there are nearly 1 billion people using Facebook Messenger. That’s almost a billion people you could potentially reach through ads on Messenger.\n\n22. Reels hit 200 billion views per day across Facebook apps\n\nThe popularity of Reels isn’t dying out anytime soon. In fact, Reels see about 200 billion views on a daily basis across the Facebook family of apps.\n\nWith algorithms further pushing this format, Reels could help you gain visibility and engagement. In short, brands can’t afford to put this short-form video format on the back burner.\n\nFacebook consumer behavior statistics\n\nFinally, are people even shopping on Facebook? Here are some stats on how consumers are behaving on the platform:\n\n23. Facebook has the highest number of social commerce buyers\n\nAccording to eMarketer, US adults were more likely to make a purchase directly on Facebook in Q1 2023. However, when compared to Gen Z buyers, it’s in fourth place behind TikTok, Instagram and YouTube.\n\n24. Facebook commerce is expected to hit 64.6 million shoppers in 2024\n\nAs the most popular social media platform for commerce, there are tens of millions of shoppers on the platform. The same eMarketer study as above showcases that Facebook commerce is expected to continue to grow, reaching 64.6 million shoppers by the end of 2024.\n\nHow do these Facebook stats inform your social media strategy?\n\nThese key Facebook statistics should give you some idea of where the platform currently stands in the social media landscape. As such, you can use these to guide your strategy and understand what to prioritize. To advance your strategy even further, take advantage of different Facebook marketing tools.\n\nFacebook statistics FAQs\n\nHow do I find my Facebook stats?\n\nYou can find your Facebook Page’s unique Facebook stats by logging into your business page and heading to your Facebook Insights.\n\nWhat are statistics for Facebook Reels?\n\nFacebook Reels have been popular on the app since integrated from Instagram. Facebook Reels with audio see a 35% higher CTR than other types of video content on the platform. And across Facebook and Instagram, Reels see about 200 billion views daily.\n\nIs Facebook still growing?\n\nFacebook adoption is seeing slow growth and still hit 3 billion monthly active users by the end of Q4 2023.

But think about how you can bring long-form storytelling into your content.\n\nTrend 2: Playful content is the new “brand personality”\n\nThe “edgy” brand voice is taking a back seat to a new brand trend: experimenting with playful content.\n\nBrands have consistently found creative ways to tap into meme culture and the voice of the Internet in a way that fits their voice. And we’ve seen more brands experimenting with their voice and visual content to do so.\n\nTake LinkedIn’s Threads, which have a human voice and cover topics that range from relatable and hilarious, to inspirational and endearing.\n\nAnd we love the way Auntie Anne’s pretzels has create a strategic, branded social media meme strategy. They create content that riffs on Internet culture, memes and trends while still staying true to their brand colors, tone and image.\n\nBrand takeaway: Think about how your brand can get playful on social media. You don’t have to do this in a way that breaks your brand’s voice and tone. What trends and meme formats could you adapt to fit your brand’s content?\n\nTrend 3: The expansion of social commerce remains a trend to watch—and use\n\nWe’ve all seen the #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt trend…or bought something after seeing it on TikTok or another social platform ourselves.\n\nBut this is more than a fleeting trend—social commerce is a continuing trend to watch and consider for your strategy. And platforms like TikTok are pushing for it. TikTok Shop officially launched in the US in late 2023. And they’re already testing ways to make that in-app shopping even easier.\n\nWe talked to Social Strategy Director at Mekanism, Jeff MacDonald, about current social trends to watch. And this is one that he flagged. As he puts it, live streaming and interactive shopping experiences are only expected to expand, so this trend is likely here to stay. “Live shopping events, combining entertainment with instant purchasing options, offer an engaging way for brands to connect with consumers. This year will be a test to see if North American audiences will adopt live commerce streams like other audiences have.”\n\nBrand takeaway: If you haven’t experimented with selling on social, now is a great time to test this out. There’s an eager, ready-to-buy audience on social. Give them another way to buy—look into whether opening up shop on TikTok, Facebook or Instagram is right for your brand.\n\nTrend 4: SEO is important for social channels too—not just your site\n\nRecently, I did research on a few places I want to travel and hike this coming summer. I didn’t turn to Google—I searched location hashtags on Instagram.\n\nDon’t underestimate the power of social media platforms as search engines. In 2022, nearly 40% of Gen Z preferred TikTok over Google for searching for information.\n\nThis makes optimizing your content for discoverability—both in feed and via search—more important than ever before.\n\nBrand takeaway: Just as you would optimize an article on your blog or a page on your site for SEO, take an optimized approach to your social content. Optimize your posts and profile for maximum discoverability by using the right keywords in your caption, the right hashtags and relevant keywords within your alt text, too.\n\nTrend 5: Behind-the-scenes content and reimagined transparency\n\nThe rising audience desire for authentic content lends itself to the need for brands to be more transparent about their business practices on social.\n\nBut there’s been an interesting shift. A few years ago, we couldn’t talk about trends in social media without covering the importance of brands speaking up—or getting called out. But in 2023, only a quarter of consumers polled in the Index said the most memorable brands on social spoke out about causes and news aligned with their values.\n\nThe Index also found the second biggest thing consumers don’t see enough of from brands on social media is transparency about business practices and values.\n\nI take this to mean that while brands speaking out used to set them apart, now it’s a regular expectation that brands demonstrate transparency and their values as a regular practice. We talked to Paula Perez, Social Engagement & Community Growth Specialist at Oatly, about current social trends. And as Perez puts it, “Consumers are more interested than ever in labor practices, diversity, investor relations, supply chain, company leadership, and environmental responsibility.”\n\nFor example, shoe brand Nisolo regularly creates and posts sustainability “report cards” for their products.\n\nBrand takeaway: Look for opportunities to provide more transparency about your business, products and practices. You can start as simple as creating behind-the-scenes content of your office, products being made, the people behind your products and your sustainability values. Make sure you have action or proof to back up your statements.\n\nAnd if questions do arise that your brand should address, use the right tools to stay proactive. Social listening will help you identify rising conversation topics early, enabling you to understand and get ahead of an issue, and identify the changes you need to make.\n\nTrend 6: Authentic content resonates across platforms\n\nAuthentic, non-promotional content is the number one thing consumers say they don’t see enough of from brands on social, according to The Sprout Social Index™. We’ve seen the way creator culture has skyrocketed in popularity—and brands featuring authentic voices, from creators to employees, shine against those that don’t.\n\nAnd it’s crucial for brands to recognize that this trend is here to stay—it’s the new era of social media.\n\nWe talked to Flywire Social Media Manager Sam Mackowitz, who believes AI is only driving this desire for more authenticity. “I think people will be yearning for authentic experiences on social media. Don’t get me wrong, AI is fantastic and can help us get places faster, but…that personal aspect is so important and will continue to be in 2024.”\n\nBrand takeaway: Besides tapping into creators, create more authentic owned content, too. As Mackowitz explains, “At Flywire, the content that performs the best for us is always when it’s showcasing our employees. We’ve had great success showcasing the people behind the payments! Authenticity will soar in 2024.”\n\nThink: playful posts and featuring fellow employees in video content who aren’t camera shy, or a “meet the team” series. Get creative!\n\nAn employee advocacy strategy is a stellar way to promote your brand authentically. Using a platform like Employee Advocacy by Sprout Social makes it easier for your employees to discover content and copy suggestions you curate for them to share.\n\nTrend 7: The evolution of social teams and titles\n\nIs your social team structure based on networks? Then you’re not alone—according to the Index, 64% of social teams are aligned to specific social platforms or networks.\n\nBut the reality is, your team structure is constantly running the risk of becoming outdated. As social media evolves, so do the teams and the skills needed to run it successfully. And the emergence of new platforms, like Threads, always brings back the same question: whose responsibility is a new platform when you’re divided by network?\n\nNew social media jobs and titles are emerging and evolving rapidly. We talked to Gabby Grahek, Strategic Services Consultant at Sprout and a social media thought leader, about current social trends. “I’m hoping and praying for social specialties on social teams. With organizations continuing to experiment with social, build a budget for these teams and elevate their maturity levels when you can.”\n\nBrand takeaway: Gabby thinks “we’ll see niche social professions develop on corporate teams.” Evaluate your current team structure and identify gaps. This is a great opportunity to take additional ownership over your career path and pitch a new role that fits your skillset. Or, make the case to your manager that you need more headcount to accommodate a new role.\n\nTrend 8: The boom of the creator and influencer economy\n\nToday, it’s the creator and influencer’s world—we’re just posting in it.\n\nIn the era of authenticity, creators and influencers lend an authentic, human voice and experience to the social scroll. And their place on brand accounts is only going to become more important to connecting with audiences. In fact, in a Q3 Sprout Pulse Survey of 307 US-based marketers, 8 in 10 social marketers describe influencer marketing as essential to their social strategies.\n\nAs Jeff MacDonald mentioned, “The continued dominance of TikTok underscores the shift towards more authentic, unfiltered content. This trend is likely to grow, with users gravitating towards content that feels genuine and relatable. Brands will increasingly leverage creators and influencers who can craft compelling stories and connect with audiences on a personal level.”\n\nBrand takeaway: The rise of creators and influencers and the authentic voice they provide will likely remain on the list of social media trends for years to come. So now is the time to kick off your creator and influencer marketing partnerships and program, if you haven’t already.\n\nAs Jeff put it, “Authenticity in content not only enhances engagement but also fosters trust and loyalty among consumers. This trend is very much in line with the human-centric approach to social media, where human creativity and connection are pivotal in crafting brand messages.”\n\nConsider adopting a dedicated creator and influencer management platform, which over half of brands have done according to a Q3 Sprout Pulse Survey. Platforms like Tagger by Sprout Social make managing your influencer partnerships and their impact easier.\n\nTrend 9: Personalized customer care is a consumer preference\n\nThe expectations for social media customer service have only gone up. Consumers no longer just want fast responses—70% of them expect personalized responses to their customer service needs, according to the Index.\n\nAnd 76% of consumers notice and appreciate when companies prioritize customer support—so companies who don’t do so inevitably fall behind.\n\nBrand takeaway: Stay up to date with customer service trends. Analyze your role in social customer care: how responsive are you being, and what can you do to scale your efforts?\n\nSome 75% of businesses in the Index say that social customer care will be shared to some degree by marketing and customer service teams. If this is also the case for you, remember that solid customer care is about empowering all teams involved to collaborate and communicate. Ensure that both teams are aligned on social voice and tone, response best practices, canned response use, chat bot updates and more.\n\nFeatures like Sprout’s Case Management enable teams to seamlessly work together to resolve customer issues, while integrations with platforms like Zendesk and Salesforce enable agents and social team members alike to get more context behind customer interactions, making personalization much easier.\n\nTrend 10: Marketing and customer care teams use AI regularly…and monitor it closely\n\nThe use of AI to streamline workflows remains one of the current social media trends that will stretch into this year—and beyond.\n\nAccording to The 2023 Social Index™, over 80% of marketers have already seen the positive impact of AI on their work. You yourself may be in that group. And beyond scaling content creation and customer care responses, AI will likely play an even larger role as a marketing and customer care tool.\n\nAs Jeff MacDonald tells us, “In 2024, we can expect a deeper integration of AI in personalizing user experiences. AI can analyze user data to provide highly tailored content recommendations, enhance customer service with more responsive chatbots, and drive more effective targeted advertising. This trend aligns with the increasing efficiency in content production, as AI tools become more adept at understanding and replicating human-like interactions and creativity.”\n\nBut this year, we forecast that this trend will look a little different. While there’s been a sustained use in AI, we’ve also seen a trend of increased conversations around AI ethics and using it safely.\n\nAs Gabby Grahek puts it, “Now that the shock of AI availability is wearing off, I expect companies that have been hesitant to adopt AI tools will develop (strict) adherence and governance policies to start taking advantage of the efficiencies available from the use of AI.”\n\nBrand takeaway: Join the marketers who are using AI to scale their content creation and customer care efforts. But always use it carefully and ethically—create an AI use policy to safeguard your brand and team.\n\nTrend 11: Social data is key—beyond the marketing team\n\nOne of the biggest social media myths is that social data is only relevant to social or marketing. On the contrary—social media data has the power to inform every area and team of your organization and improve your entire business, from product, to customer support to PR.\n\nAccording to the Index, 76% of marketers agree that their team’s social insights inform other departments. And this trend is here to stay. Companies that don’t use social to inform their wider business will undoubtedly fall behind.\n\nNot to mention, getting deep into the data is one of the best ways to identify trends in social media in your owned content.\n\nAs social teams become more sophisticated, so will their use of data beyond their team…as long as social teams know how to communicate that data with other departments.\n\nBrand takeaway: You already know how valuable social data is—this year, demonstrate this to other teams. Download our 2024 Social Media Toolkit for six resources that will help you streamline your strategy and share its impact.\n\nUse these social media trends to keep your strategy one step ahead\n\nWe can’t always know when a new platform, content format or trending TikTok sound will bubble up. In fact, they usually surprise us in a drop-everything-and-film-this-content way.\n\nBut we can look at the larger social media marketing trends now and use them to build a stronger strategy that sets us up for success. And that creates a solid foundation that not even the advent of a new platform can shake. (Well, maybe a little.)",
      "# [Social media marketing: What it is and how to build your strategy by Jamia Kenan on 2024-08-22](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-marketing-strategy/)\nLooking to fine-tune your social media marketing strategy? Now’s the perfect time to make it happen. In a landscape with more competition, content and networks than ever, a succinct strategy gives you the focus needed to say “no” to efforts that don’t serve your goals.\n\nThat’s why we put together a comprehensive guide to creating a social media marketing plan from scratch. Whether you’re totally new to social or want to double-check your priorities in 2024, this guide has you covered.\n\nWhat is social media marketing?\n\nSocial media marketing means using social media platforms like Instagram, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Facebook to promote your brand and sell your product or service.\n\nIf your business comes out with a new item and you plan to promote the launch on social media, that’s social media marketing. If you interact with your customers via comments, that’s social media marketing. And if you create engaging content that showcases your brand’s values and story, that’s social media marketing too.\n\nThis form of marketing requires you to use social media management skills and tools. Just as you prepare other aspects of your marketing strategy, you need to have a plan for your social media marketing.\n\nWhat is a social media marketing strategy?\n\nA social media marketing strategy is a comprehensive plan that integrates your social media efforts with your team’s goals and the broader business objectives. This alignment ensures that your activities are not only optimized for performance but also deliver measurable results that contribute to your overall marketing success.\n\nA well-defined social media marketing strategy also sets clear boundaries around your team’s time and expertise. Social media is a unique channel, and while nearly everyone uses it, this widespread usage often leads people to overestimate their expertise.\n\nEvery social media manager has faced requests to share content that isn’t formatted correctly or doesn’t align with the overarching campaign. Having a robust social media marketing strategy empowers you to confidently say “no” when necessary, ensuring that your efforts remain focused and effective.\n\nWhat are the benefits of a social media strategy?\n\nThis question can feel like a bit of a no-brainer to marketers that live and breathe social. That said, being able to clearly articulate the advantages of a cohesive social media strategy is crucial for securing buy-in from other stakeholders. Here’s how a well-defined social media strategy benefits your brand and business:\n\nIt increases brand awareness and engagement\n\nAccording to The Sprout Social Index™ 2023, more than half (53%) of consumers say their social media usage has increased over the last two years. Amid a fractured cultural landscape, social media has emerged to fill a seemingly endless need for content.\n\nWhen brands commit to a cohesive social media marketing strategy, they develop the consistency needed to form a brand identity that cuts through the noise to resonate with a target audience. Case in point: Figo Pet Insurance.\n\nIn 2022, the Figo team committed to sharing four to five TikTok videos per week. Over time, they were able to pinpoint what messages appeal to their audience. These efforts led to audience growth and multiple viral videos.\n\nAs you refine your strategy over time, you too can craft more precise messaging that not only attracts more fans but also drives greater engagement.\n\nIt promotes brand trust\n\nSocial’s impact on brand trust is palpable, particularly for younger consumers.\n\nAccording to a Q2 2024 Sprout Pulse Survey, 78% of consumers surveyed strongly/somewhat agree that—compared to a year ago—a brand’s social media presence has a larger impact on whether or not they trust that brand. That number goes up to 88% for Gen Z. What influences that trust the most? The content you post on social.\n\nIn the 2010s, a poorly designed website might deter consumers due to concerns about fraud. Today, the same principle applies to social media. If consumers get to your profiles and see irregular updates, inconsistent messaging or content that doesn’t align with where it’s been posted, it’s going to raise red flags and undermine trust.\n\nIt supports performance measurement\n\nYour social media marketing strategy creates the infrastructure needed to prove the ROI of your efforts. Without one, you may be able to report on social media KPIs, but it'll be much harder to showcase how they align with strategic objectives.\n\nFor example, say you work with an automotive brand and one of your top business objectives is to increase market share with parents of young children. With that in mind, you can develop a strategic content pillar around this specific audience, and report on the performance of those posts over time.\n\nWith a social listening tool, you can even measure how your brand’’s share of voice stacks up against key competitors. This is a highly effective way to gauge your brand’s visibility and market share within your industry.\n\nLearn more about social listening tools\n\nIt drives revenue\n\nOur Q2 2024 Pulse Survey also found that social media is the top channel for product discovery, with 81% of consumers surveyed using the channel to shop around for their next purchase.\n\nAs social commerce adoption continues to skyrocket in the US and abroad, social media now supports a full-funnel experience. Even B2B brands are using social media to enhance lead generation and drive pipeline growth.\n\nFor example, when Simpli.fi, an advertising success platform, integrated employee advocacy into their social media strategy, the company realized $90,000 in earned media value in three months.\n\nHow to create a social media marketing strategy\n\nNow that we’ve defined social media marketing and its benefits, let’s walk through how to create a plan.\n\nHere’s our six-step process for developing a social media marketing strategy that drives results.\n\nStep 1: Set goals and establish KPIs\n\nSocial media strategy planning starts with your goals. Whether you want to expand your team, build a larger following or a more active community, taking the time to define your social goals is the first step to reaching them.\n\nThe goals you set will inform the key performance indicators (KPIs) you track, and how much time and energy you’ll need to dedicate to your campaigns.\n\nExample social media goals for 2024 and beyond\n\nWhat really matters is that you set realistic social media goals. We recommend tackling smaller objectives that allow you to scale your social efforts in a way that’s both reasonable and affordable.\n\nBelow are some example social media marketing goals that businesses of all shapes and sizes can pursue.\n\nGoal example 1: Increase brand awareness\n\nBrand awareness means getting your name out there. Some 68% of consumers say the primary reason they follow a brand on social media is to stay informed about new products or services, according to The Sprout Social Index™.\n\nTry to avoid solely publishing promotional messages and strike a good balance with authentic content that emphasizes your brand’s voice and story. The Sprout Social Index™ found that consumers don’t see enough authentic, non-promotional content from brands on social.\n\nFor example, in this TikTok video, Sani, a family-owned apparel company features a day in the life of the brand’s founders while visiting India for business.\n\nIf you want to increase brand awareness, here are the social media metrics you’ll want to focus on:\n\nReach: Post reach is the number of unique users who saw your post. How much of your content actually reaches users’ feeds?\n\nImpressions: At the post level, impressions are how many times a post is displayed to someone. Impressions are a good indicator of how popular a piece of content is, and that people may be viewing a post multiple times.\n\nHashtag performance: What were your most-used hashtags? Which hashtags were most associated with your brand? Having these answers can help shape the focus of your content going forward.\n\nVideo views: This may come off as a vanity metric. But on certain channels, like TikTok, views count as impressions, and are therefore important to monitor.\n\nGoal example 2: Generate leads and sales\n\nWhether online, in-store or directly through your social profiles, followers don’t make purchases by accident. For example, are you alerting customers about new products and promos? Are you integrating your product catalog into your social profiles? Are you running exclusive deals for followers? Social media gives you an avenue to generate revenue.\n\nHere are the metrics you’ll want to track if you’re focused on lead generation and sales:\n\nConversions: A conversion is when someone takes a desired action, like purchasing something from your site or signing up for an upcoming event.\n\nConversion rate: Conversion rate measures how well your social ad or campaign is convincing people to take a desired action.\n\nGoal example 3: Grow your brand’s audience\n\nBringing new followers into the fold means finding ways to introduce your brand to folks who haven’t heard of you before. Growing your audience also means discovering conversations around your business and industry that matter the most.\n\nDigging through your social channels is nearly impossible without monitoring or listening for specific keywords, phrases or hashtags. Having a pulse on these conversations helps you expand your core audience (and reach adjacent audiences) much faster.\n\nImportant audience growth metrics include:\n\nFollower growth: Your follower growth measures the net new followers you gained in a specific time period.\n\nFollower growth rate: The percentage that shows you how quickly your audience is actually growing—or slowing—within a certain time period.\n\nGoal example 4: Provide holistic customer care\n\nThe Index shows over half of consumers believe the most memorable thing a brand can do on social media is respond to customers.\n\nAlthough 76% of consumers value quick responses, providing quality customer care isn’t just responding rapidly. Consumer expectations have evolved. Some 70% of consumers expect brands to provide a holistic experience with personalized responses that fit their unique customer service needs.\n\nThis means companies need to experiment with messaging and content when approaching customer care. For example, does your team have a protocol for handling @-mentions and comments? Do you have templated responses to FAQs? Does your brand promote user-generated content and hashtags? Your customers can be your best cheerleaders, but only if you give them a reason to grab the megaphone.\n\nIf you want to improve your business’ approach to social customer care, here are the customer service metrics you need to track:\n\nAverage first reply time: The time it takes for your team to send out the first reply to an inbound customer message within business hours.\n\nReply or response rate: The rate that brands respond to messages or comments that they receive on a daily basis.\n\nResolution rate: The percentage of customer inquiries that are fully resolved. This metric can reveal how equipped your entire company is to address customer inquiries.\n\nGoal example 5: Drive traffic to your site to illustrate ROI of social efforts\n\nThe Sprout Social Index™ shows 46% of marketers plan to calculate the return on investment (ROI) of advertising spend to connect the value of social to business goals in 2024.\n\nSimple enough. If you’re laser-focused on generating leads or traffic to your website, social media can make it happen. Whether through organic promotional posts or social ads, keeping an eye on the following metrics can help you better determine your ROI from social media:\n\nWebsite traffic: Monitoring website traffic can help you properly attribute increases to specific campaigns or viral posts.\n\nSocial media referral traffic: This describes people who visit your website directly from social media pages and posts.\n\nAny combination of these goals is fair game and can help you better understand which networks to tackle, too. When in doubt, keep your social media marketing strategy simple rather than complicating it with too many objectives that might distract you. Pick one or two and rally your team around them.\n\nBonus resource: A great deck can bridge the gap between raw social data and direct business value. Use this presentation template to pitch a compelling vision for your next campaign, initiative or annual strategy\n\nGet the deck template\n\nStep 2: Research your target audience and select your networks\n\nMaking assumptions is bad news for marketers. Both leaders and practitioners can disprove assumptions from the valuable insights social data provides. With the right tool, marketers can quickly research their audience. No formal market research or data science chops necessary.\n\nWhat you need to know about your audience to influence your social media marketing strategy is already available. You just have to know where to look.\n\nRemember: different platforms attract different audiences. Social media demographics and benchmark statistics are great for understanding where your target audience lives, but it's also important to understand the nuances of each social network so you can decide where your business needs to be.\n\nFor the sake of narrowing down where you should spend your time, below is a quick overview of each of the major social platforms:\n\nX\n\nSimple and straightforward, X is a solid starting point for most businesses. Requiring minimal setup and providing a place to go back and forth with followers directly, there's a reason why X remains one of the go-to platforms for customer service. If you’re trying to master the social media marketing basics of hashtags, tagging, brand voice and social media etiquette, look no further.\n\nFacebook\n\nFacebook is a must-have for brick-and-mortar businesses looking to target local customers. Allowing check-ins and reviews, it’s a prime place to grow a dedicated local following. Plus, they have an incredible chatbot functionality that can take your customer service strategy and marketing campaigns to the next level.\n\nLike many social algorithm changes, the platform’s algorithm change in late 2022 posed a challenge to some businesses looking to grow their Pages and stay in touch with fans consistently. The earliest algorithm prioritized Likes, but today’s is much more sophisticated and focuses on showing users the most relevant, meaningful content based on inventory, signals, relevancy scoring and other factors. That said, Facebook’s ad platform is the gold standard for social media ads because it can help businesses cut through the noise and lessen the impact of algorithm changes.\n\nInstagram\n\nAt its core, Instagram is a network centered around visual content. A major hub for brick-and-mortar businesses, e-commerce shops and influencers alike, the platform encourages brands to get creative. From eye-popping photos to clever captions, it’s all about finding unique ways to show off what you’re selling.\n\nThreads\n\nWhen Meta released Threads on July 5, 2023, the social network received over 100 million registrations less than a week after its launch, making it the most rapidly downloaded app ever. The launch of Threads sparked conversations about its role in the fediverse, or decentralized social media.\n\nBut, for now, Threads is a text-based social network that users can sign up for through their current Instagram account. Users can post on mobile, but Threads is also available on desktop. Threads are great for brands who already have Instagram accounts because the sign-up process is pretty seamless.\n\nLinkedIn\n\nLinkedIn is a network laser-focused on business trends and networking. LinkedIn is a goldmine, especially for anyone networking in the B2B space. Looking to get in touch with an influencer, marketing manager or CEO? Chances are you can find them here.\n\nThere are so many benefits of using LinkedIn marketing beyond networking, including content distribution and lead generation. We also have a guide for LinkedIn best practices so you can get full advantage of those benefits.\n\nPinterest\n\nPinterest marketing is insanely popular, especially among Gen Z and Millennials. Over 465 million people use this visual pinning platform every month to find inspiration and their next purchase. Pinterest is noted to be one of the best networks for social selling. Like Instagram, Pinterest thrives on imagery and inspirational content where products serve as the proverbial centerpiece.\n\nTikTok\n\nTikTok reached 1 billion users in September 2021 and remains one of the most popular apps in the world. Along with its viral trends and niche communities, the short-form video app is known for its hyper-personalized algorithm that keeps users scrolling for hours. TikTok marketing has changed the game for brands, allowing them to connect with customers in an entirely new way.\n\nYouTube\n\nAlthough some might not regard YouTube as a traditional social network, the platform’s active and engaged community speaks for itself. Considering that video represents the top-performing type of content across nearly every social network, YouTube is a great place to house your videos if you’re already producing them.\n\nPicking networks for your social media marketing strategy\n\nThere are more than 15 social media platforms your brand can use, but don’t spread yourself too thin. Rather than try to dominate them all, you should consider which platforms make the most sense based on your industry and target audience.\n\nDo your homework on your existing social media audience and focus on networks where your core audience is already active. You need to do further analysis before you can determine what your real-world social customers actually look like.\n\nThat’s why many brands use a social media marketing dashboard that provides an overview of who’s following you and how they interact with you on each channel.\n\nFor example, Sprout’s analytics dashboard puts your audience demographics front and center. It highlights which social networks see the most activity, helping you ensure you spend your time on the right network.\n\nYou can also use analytics to determine if you should create a new social media account. With Sprout, you can view X, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube and Pinterest data side-by-side in a customizable format that’s exportable by date range and profile.\n\nThere are plenty of other sources of valuable audience data to supplement your social media insights. This includes your Google and email analytics, your CRM, your customer service platform or even your best-selling products.\n\nAll of the above will ultimately influence everything from your marketing messaging to how you’ll approach customer service or social commerce.\n\nStep 3: Create (and curate) timely & engaging social content\n\nNo surprises here. Your social media marketing strategy hinges on your content. At this point, you should have a pretty good idea of what to publish based on your goals, audience and brand identity. You probably feel confident in which networks to cover, too.\n\nBut what about your content strategy? Below are some tips, ideas and inspiration that can help.\n\nDefining your content strategy\n\nComing up with a content strategy might seem like a lot of legwork, but it all really boils down to your goals.\n\nLooking to educate your audience in the B2B space? Publish blogs, news and opinions relevant to your industry.\n\nTrying to push e-commerce products? Post action shots of your products and photos of others showing off your swag.\n\nFocused on customer service? Tips, shout-outs and company updates are fair game.\n\nRegardless of what you might post, coming up with a hashtag to couple with your content is a brilliant branding move.\n\nHashtags can be used to get your attention and encourage people to share their photos interacting with your brand.\n\nFind your brand voice\n\nOne of the best ways to stand out on social media is to define your distinct brand voice. Chances are you’ve seen a post from a particular brand that just feels like, well, theirs.\n\nThe quippy, casual tone that makes Discord’s X presence beloved by casual users and moderators alike is a great example.\n\nOf course, not every company will benefit from the same sort of tone. The key is to present yourself as a human rather than a robot. Adopt a consistent brand voice and style that’s appropriate for your business.\n\nBake timeliness into your strategy\n\nTimeliness is arguably more important than ever for marketers. Not only are you expected to put out fresh content regularly, but also to always be “on” for your followers. But you can’t always expect customers to operate on your clock. And timeliness is a tall order when you’re strapped for resources or are part of a small team.\n\nAs evidenced by our best times to post on social, brands have a lot of ground to cover in terms of frequency and how much content to push. It’s important to pay attention to the optimal times for engagement so you can automate the most tedious aspects of your social presence without having to worry about posting in real time.\n\nBut, quick question: When is your brand available to engage and interact with customers?\n\nYou might see some recommended times to post late in the evening, for example. But if your team isn’t there to communicate, what’s the point of posting at the “preferred” time?\n\nWhen you’re able to do so, ensure your social media or community managers are available and ready to answer any product questions or concerns when you post. Take time to review the best times to post on social media, but remember that it’s just as critical to engage after posting\n\nYou should also consider taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and automation so you can serve and engage with customers when your team is offline, which leads us to our next point.\n\nTake advantage of short-form video\n\nThanks to the rise of TikTok and Instagram Reels, social video is booming. Short-form productions continue to dominate the social space across all platforms due to their high engagement rate.\n\nSprout Social’s 2022 Index data shows that consumers find short-form videos 2.5x more engaging than long-form ones. Some 66% of consumers report paying the most attention to short-form content as well.\n\nThanks to advancements in DIY and remote video production, you don’t need massive budgets to be successful. All you need is a laptop or smartphone and a few tricks of the trade, like video length best practices and editing tools.\n\nShare posts that show off your brand’s uniqueness and human side\n\nBoth personal and personable content should be a cornerstone of your social media marketing strategy. Don’t be afraid to remind followers of the humans behind your posts. Remember that over a third of consumers are looking for authentic, original content from brands.\n\nFor example, Zoom has excellent original content on their Instagram and TikTok accounts, like this Reel that explores the different signs in the workplace:\n\nStep 4: Collaborate with influencers\n\nIf you haven’t already, it’s time to tap into the power of influencer marketing. Social partnerships are very effective when executed correctly: they can help drive traffic to your website, produce compelling content and inspire purchase decisions.\n\nBut consumers care about creators’ qualifications, so choose wisely. The two most important qualifications of content creators working with brands is their experience with the product/service and their authenticity.\n\nIdentify creators who align with your brand and consider how they can help you craft stand-out content for your audience.\n\nWhat consumers want from influencer-brand collaborations\n\nAccording to the 2024 Influencer Marketing Report, consumers overall look to engage with influencers who align with their personal values (53%) and seem authentic (47%), even when posting sponsored content and taking part in brand campaigns.\n\nAcross ages and genders, honest and unbiased content stops audiences mid-scroll, while aspirational content is least likely to catch their attention.\n\nHowever, the report also found that authenticity is losing its appeal among younger generations. While trust in influencers remains strong—and is even growing among younger consumers—only 35% of Gen Z value authenticity, compared to nearly half of Millennials, Gen X‌ and Baby Boomers.\n\nThis indicates that younger generations are more aware of the influencer-brand relationship and how it influences their buying decisions, but they’re comfortable with it. Instead, they prioritize other indicators of trustworthiness, such as follower count, posting frequency‌ and community loyalty.\n\nStep 5: Bring other departments into the mix\n\nSocial media teams have a unique advantage when it comes to understanding customer sentiment. You’re the eyes and ears for your brand online. Those insights can do more than just inform marketing strategy.\n\nThey can transform your business. Stand-out social media teams will approach cross-department collaboration with enthusiasm and intention.\n\nWhich departments can benefit from social data?\n\nThe short answer? All of them. Index data shows 76% of social marketers say their team’s insights inform other departments.\n\nHowever, don’t bite off more than you can chew. Instead, start where you think you can make the most impact. Here are a few ideas to jumpstart your strategy.\n\nHuman Resources\n\nCollaborating with human resources on social-first employer brand initiatives can do more than just fill open roles quickly. It can attract stronger, more qualified candidates as well. Many companies have embraced social recruiting strategies, such as publishing creative “we’re hiring” posts on LinkedIn to attract top talent.\n\nSales\n\nData from The 2023 Sprout Social Index™ notes marketers plan to track conversations and sales directly resulting from social efforts in 2024 to better connect the value of social to business goals. Sharing social insights with your sales organization can empower reps to work smarter in the context of increasingly digital customer journeys. Consider learning more about social selling to leverage the power of online networks even further.\n\nProduct and merchandising\n\nYou’ve probably received quite a few feature or product requests while managing your brand’s social inbox.\n\nWith a social media management tool, you can distill those messages into actionable insights for your product or merchandising teams. These insights can complement existing roadmap research, creating a customer-focused plan that delights.\n\nCustomer care\n\nMonitoring customer service metrics like average reply time, average wait time and response volume can help your social customer care team identify what is working well and spot opportunities for improvement. Marketers are using social media customer service software to elevate their support strategies and get the most out of their tech stack.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate and improve your social media strategy\n\nBy now you should have a big-picture understanding of your social media strategy. However, it’s important to adapt your strategy throughout the year.\n\nWithout continuously analyzing your efforts, you’ll never know how one campaign did over another. Having a bird’s eye view of your social media activity helps put things into perspective. This means looking at your top-performing content and adjusting your campaigns when your content stalls.\n\nThere’s no denying that a lot of social media is a matter of trial-and-error. Monitoring the metrics behind your campaigns in real time allows you to make small tweaks to your social media marketing strategy rather than sweeping, time-consuming changes.\n\nDoing social media marketing right starts by being diligent about your data. You can be reactive in the short term to get the most out of your running campaigns, and then proactively use these takeaways to inform your next strategy overhaul.\n\nTo guarantee that you get in front of as many customers as possible, monitoring your growth is a major must-do. With Sprout, social reports can clue you in on everything from your top-performing content to how engaged your audience is. These reports are crucial for accountability and guaranteeing your numbers continue to tick upward.\n\nReporting on data is also important for the sake of sharing valuable insights from social with your coworkers and colleagues. Remember that 60% of organizations use social data daily—be one of the brands that embrace it.\n\nSharing this information in regular reports not only holds you accountable for your efforts but also highlights the impact and bottom-line results your social strategy produces.\n\nBased on your data, you can better assess whether your KPIs truly ladder up to your overarching company goals or whether they need to change.\n\nAnd with that, we wrap up your social media strategy guide for 2024 and beyond!\n\nIs your social media marketing strategy future proof?\n\nThis guide highlights plenty of moving pieces to maintain a modern social presence. That said, putting together yours doesn’t have to be a drag.\n\nIf you set actionable goals and address each of the steps above, you’ll already be way ahead of the curve when it comes to your social media marketing strategy.",

So far, the only actions we have taken is ignoring for Facebook and reporting as spam for Twitter via Sprout.\n\n@reid.zura Ugh, this seems to be happening to so many of us!\n\nFor Facebook: I learned a lifechanging tip yesterday from someone in the #HigherEdSocial community on Facebook. I’ll try to reiterate here, but I just asked the OP if I can share the video they created. They did a great step-by-step tutorial on this.\n\nSo, there’s a way to automate your Meta inbox and create a rule to exclude certain keywords coming in:\n\nGo to inbox\n\nClick on “Automations” - it’s the second button from the left at the top of the interface (screenshot below)\n\nClick “Create Automation” in the upper right corner\n\nClick “Start from scratch” to create a new automation\n\nName your rule\n\nUnder “When this happens,” select “New message received” to start automation\n\nClick “Add condition” and select “Keywords”\n\nInput some of the main keywords in your recurring messages\n\nUnder “Take this action,” select “Mark as” and “Move to spam”\n\nSave changes\n\nHope this helps! It has already saved me time this morning. (Thanks OP, if you’re reading this!!)\n\nFor X: Our team sunset our X account back in August, but I still monitor for brand conversations and see these spam posts pop up from time to time. I tend to ignore or report, but it is annoying. Maybe X has a way to automate as well? I’m not sure, but hopefully someone here can help.\n\nBest of luck!\n\nI’m having the same issue, I’m so glad that someone posted this!\n\nThank you @michaelajo20 ! That is so helpful!\n\n@michelle.reddick Of course! I couldn’t believe I had been living this long without Meta inbox automations, haha!\n\nHi! Here Flor from Argentina. We experienced in private messages (in Facebook) a lot of people making random questions about the brand, but when we answer, most of them say that they never sent the message. They ask questions like, can you tell me more about the business? Anyone experienced this?\n\nThank you!\n\nThe other place on Facebook I’ve started seeing these spam messages are bots leaving Recommendations/Reviews - which of course aren’t as easily removed as a tag or regular post.\n\n@Laura Porcincula is there a way to do a similar automation in Smart Inbox? To filter incoming messages to be marked as complete and labeled as spam?\n\n@reid.zura Ugh, this seems to be happening to so many of us!\n\nFor Facebook: I learned a lifechanging tip yesterday from someone in the #HigherEdSocial community on Facebook.

Has anybody else?\n\nGreat question @mary, advanced plan users can set up rules to hide the message on the native platforms. I shared the steps for those rules in this Sprout customer only thread if you need some more info.\n\nI knew this couldn’t just be happening to the accounts I manage! So glad to see that others are just as frustrated. (Not glad that we’re frustrated, just glad that I’m not alone.)\n\nIn one of the newsletters I got this morning, I found this solution. I promise that’s a link to a real blog and not a spam link Crossing my fingers it helps this weekend!\n\nHi @lisa.roughley - we also have now had these spam comments coming in as reviews! I have not found a fix for it but if I do I’ll post here. Please share with me if you find it first!\n\nCheers,\n\nStacy\n\nFor a number of our clients, we have turned off reviews for now. I’m guessing FB is working on this issue because we’ve noticed a huge drop in reviews overall and in, investigating, found that review access via mobile is cumbersome. That’s, at least what we’re guessing has created the big drop in real reviews.\n\n@reid.zura Ugh, this seems to be happening to so many of us!\n\nFor Facebook: I learned a lifechanging tip yesterday from someone in the #HigherEdSocial community on Facebook.

Many of these updates will be featured in Breaking Ground, Sprout’s quarterly showcase of the company’s latest product innovations.\n\nCustomer service is paramount for brands as poor customer experiences can cost businesses worldwide trillions of dollars every year1. Exceptional customer care starts with meeting customers where they are, and recent research shows that is increasingly social media. In fact, 80% of consumers use social media for customer care more now than they did a year ago and social is Gen Z’s primary channel for customer support2. However, with millions of interactions and data points to sift through, providing timely, personalized care on social is nearly impossible without the help of AI.\n\nThe latest enhancements to Social Customer Care by Sprout Social bring new capabilities and insights to marketers and care teams, helping them transform each customer interaction into a competitive advantage. Associated Messages, for example, give teams access to a full historical view of a case’s public and private messages so they can move accurately and efficiently, while AI-powered Message Intent Classification helps teams resolve the highest-priority messages first. Along with automated case management and upcoming AI capabilities within Salesforce Service Cloud, the updates will help take manual work off care teams’ plates so they can spend time focusing on what matters most: building lasting relationships with customers.\n\n“Social is not just another marketing channel; it’s now the number one non-traditional channel for customer service,” said Erika Trautman, Chief Product Officer, Sprout Social. “Social engagement is the cornerstone of the business-to-consumer relationship and cascades through every aspect of a business. We understand this potential and are continuing to invest in product enhancements that enable teams to work smarter and faster so they can capitalize on every opportunity to delight customers and get the maximum return on their social investments.”\n\nEmerging platforms like Threads, which now boasts over 130 million active users, provide vast opportunities for brands that have the right strategies and solutions in place. New updates to Sprout’s integration with Threads empowers brands to elevate their platform strategies by moderating and replying to Threads comments directly within Sprout’s platform, keeping them on the cutting edge of social and helping them engage their customers no matter where they are.\n\nIn addition to new capabilities and integrations that help marketers work smarter and faster, Sprout’s latest and upcoming product updates include several AI advancements that empower teams to showcase the impact of their work and accelerate data-driven decisions. Some noteworthy examples include:\n\nAnalyze by AI Assist: Offers executive summary insights for reporting widgets, reducing the time it takes to understand the performance of certain widgets while offering curated analysis with AI.\n\nConversation Breakdown Widget: Combines new data lenses like sentiment to give a powerful view of active conversations, making it easier to identify trends and insights faster.\n\nComment Sentiment in Reports: Helps marketers understand how audiences respond to certain content through new positive/negative/neutral comment counts. Gaining insight into the ‘why’ behind performance can help inform future strategy and track how certain campaigns or launches performed.\n\n“Analyze by AI Assist has been a game changer for how I approach content and campaign analysis,” said Erika Bufford, Social Listening and Reporting Assistant, Tesco. “What could previously take me hours of manual effort— such as identifying trends, measuring performance, and generating insights—can now be done in minutes. I couldn’t be happier with the difference it’s made!”\n\nLooking ahead, Sprout will launch LinkedIn integrations that allow brands to directly access LinkedIn DMs through Sprout’s platform and discover new listening data insights. These innovations will help solve critical engagement and reporting challenges facing B2B marketers on the top professional social network.\n\nLearn more about the latest advancements featured in Sprout’s Breaking Ground program here.\n\n1 Source: Qualtrics XM Institute Research from February 2024\n\n2 Source: Sprout Social Q1 2024 Consumer Pulse Survey\n\nAbout Sprout Social\n\nSprout Social is a global leader in social media management and analytics software.

These statements may relate to the success, performance, and effect on our business and customers of our product features, our market size and growth strategy, our estimated and projected costs, margins, revenue, expenditures and customer and financial growth rates, our plans and objectives for future operations, growth, initiatives or strategies. By their nature, these statements are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, including factors beyond our control, that could cause actual results, performance or achievement to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. These assumptions, uncertainties and risks include that, among others: we may not be able to sustain our revenue and customer growth rate in the future; price increases have and may continue to negatively impact demand for our products, customer acquisition and retention and reduce the total number of customers or customer additions; our business would be harmed by any significant interruptions, delays or outages in services from our platform, our API providers, or certain social media platforms; if we are unable to attract potential customers through unpaid channels, convert this traffic to free trials or convert free trials to paid subscriptions, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected; we may be unable to successfully enter new markets, manage our international expansion and comply with any applicable international laws and regulations; we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses or technologies successfully or achieve the expected benefits of such acquisitions and investments; unstable market and economic conditions, such as recession risks, effects of inflation, labor shortages, supply chain issues, high interest rates, and the impacts of current and potential future bank failures and impacts of ongoing overseas conflicts, could adversely impact our business and that of our existing and prospective customers, which may result in reduced demand for our products; we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness; covenants in our credit agreement may restrict our operations, and if we do not effectively manage our business to comply with these covenants, our financial condition could be adversely impacted; any cybersecurity-related attack, significant data breach or disruption of the information technology systems or networks on which we rely could negatively affect our business; and changing regulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we collect and use personal information and harm our brand. Additional risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements are included under the caption “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 23, 2024, as well as any future reports that we file with the SEC. Moreover, you should interpret many of the risks identified in those reports as being heightened as a result of the current instability in market and economic conditions. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made and are based on information available to Sprout Social at the time those statements are made and/or management's good faith belief as of that time with respect to future events.

These items are not within the Company’s control and may vary greatly between periods and could significantly impact future financial results.\n\nConference Call Information\n\nThe financial results and business highlights will be discussed on a conference call and webcast scheduled at 4:00 p.m. Central Time (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time) today, November 7, 2024.

In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “can,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “explore,” “intend,” “long-term model,” “may,” “medium to longer term goals,” “might” “outlook,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “strategy,” “target,” “will,” “would,” or the negative of these terms, and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements. However, not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. These statements may relate to our market size and growth strategy, our estimated and projected costs, margins, revenue, expenditures and customer and financial growth rates, our Q4 2024 and full year 2024 financial outlook, our plans and objectives for future operations, growth, initiatives or strategies. By their nature, these statements are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, including factors beyond our control, that could cause actual results, performance or achievement to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. These assumptions, uncertainties and risks include that, among others: we may not be able to sustain our revenue and customer growth rate in the future; price increases have and may continue to negatively impact demand for our products, customer acquisition and retention and reduce the total number of customers or customer additions; our business would be harmed by any significant interruptions, delays or outages in services from our platform, our API providers, or certain social media platforms; if we are unable to attract potential customers through unpaid channels, convert this traffic to free trials or convert free trials to paid subscriptions, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected; we may be unable to successfully enter new markets, manage our international expansion and comply with any applicable international laws and regulations; we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses or technologies successfully or achieve the expected benefits of such acquisitions and investments; unstable market and economic conditions, such as recession risks, effects of inflation, labor shortages, supply chain issues, high interest rates, and the impacts of current and potential future bank failures and impacts of ongoing overseas conflicts, have and could continue to adversely impact our business and that of our existing and prospective customers, which may result in reduced demand for our products; we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness; covenants in our credit agreement may restrict our operations, and if we do not effectively manage our business to comply with these covenants, our financial condition could be adversely impacted; any cybersecurity-related attack, significant data breach or disruption of the information technology systems or networks on which we rely could negatively affect our business; changing regulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we collect and use personal information and harm our brand; and risks related to ongoing legal proceedings. Additional risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements are included under the caption “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 23, 2024, as well as any future reports that we file with the SEC. Moreover, you should interpret many of the risks identified in those reports as being heightened as a result of the current instability in market and economic conditions. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made and are based on information available to Sprout Social at the time those statements are made and/or management's good faith belief as of that time with respect to future events. Sprout Social assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made, except as required by law.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nWe have provided in this press release certain financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believes that use of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with other companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of our historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review these reconciliations.\n\nNon-GAAP gross profit. We define non-GAAP gross profit as GAAP gross profit, excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization expense associated with the acquired developed technology from our acquisition of Tagger Media, Inc. (the “Tagger acquisition”). We believe non-GAAP gross profit provides our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as it eliminates the effect of stock-based compensation and amortization expense, which are often unrelated to overall operating performance. In 2023, we revised our definition of non-GAAP gross profit to exclude amortization expense associated with the acquired developed technology from the Tagger acquisition.\n\nNon-GAAP gross margin. We define non-GAAP gross margin as non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of revenue.\n\nNon-GAAP operating income (loss). We define non-GAAP operating income (loss) as GAAP loss from operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses and amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets from the Tagger acquisition. We believe non-GAAP operating income (loss) provides our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as it eliminates the effect of stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses and amortization expense, which are often unrelated to overall operating performance. In 2023, we revised our definition of non-GAAP operating income (loss) to exclude acquisition-related expenses in connection with the Tagger acquisition and amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets from the Tagger acquisition.\n\nNon-GAAP operating margin. We define non-GAAP operating margin as non-GAAP operating income (loss) as a percentage of revenue.\n\nNon-GAAP net income (loss). We define non-GAAP net income (loss) as GAAP net loss, excluding stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets from the Tagger acquisition and tax benefits due to changes in valuation allowances from business acquisitions. We believe non-GAAP net income (loss) provides our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as this non-GAAP financial measure eliminates the effect of stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses, amortization expense and tax benefits due to changes in valuation allowances from business acquisitions, which are often unrelated to overall operating performance. In 2023, we revised our definition of non-GAAP net income (loss) to exclude acquisition-related expenses in connection with the Tagger acquisition, amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets from the Tagger acquisition and tax benefits recognized from changes in the valuation allowance associated with our acquisition of Tagger.\n\nNon-GAAP net income (loss) per share. We define non-GAAP net income (loss) per share as GAAP net loss per share attributable to common shareholders, basic and diluted, excluding stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets from the Tagger acquisition and tax benefits due to changes in valuation allowances from business acquisitions. We believe non-GAAP net income (loss) per share provides our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as this non-GAAP financial measure eliminates the effect of stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses, amortization expense and tax benefits due to changes in valuation allowances from business acquisitions, which are often unrelated to overall operating performance. In 2023, we revised our definition of non-GAAP net income (loss) per share to exclude acquisition-related expenses in connection with the Tagger acquisition, amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets from the Tagger acquisition and tax benefits recognized from changes in the valuation allowance associated with our acquisition of Tagger.\n\nNon-GAAP free cash flow. We define non-GAAP free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less expenditures for property and equipment, acquisition-related costs and interest. Non-GAAP free cash flow does not reflect our future contractual obligations or represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for a given period. We believe non-GAAP free cash flow is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides information to management and investors about the amount of cash used in our core operations that, after expenditures for property and equipment, acquisition-related costs and interest, is not available for strategic initiatives. In 2023, we revised our definition of non-GAAP free cash flow to exclude payments related to acquisition-related costs associated with the Tagger acquisition (which are not applicable for the periods presented) and cash paid for interest on our revolving line of credit.\n\nNon-GAAP free cash flow margin. We define non-GAAP free cash flow margin as non-GAAP free cash flow as a percentage of revenue.\n\nNon-GAAP sales and marketing expenses, non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP general and administrative expenses. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses, non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP general and administrative expenses are defined as sales and marketing expenses, research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses, respectively, less stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide our management and investors with insight into day-to-day operating expenses given that these measures eliminate the effect of stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses. In 2023, we revised our definition of non-GAAP general and administrative expenses to exclude acquisition-related expenses in connection with the Tagger acquisition and amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets from the Tagger acquisition.\n\nKey Business Metrics\n\nAnnual recurring revenue (“ARR”). We define ARR as the annualized revenue run-rate of subscription agreements from all customers as of the last date of the specified period. We believe ARR is an indicator of the scale of our entire platform while mitigating fluctuations due to seasonality and contract term.\n\nRemaining performance obligations (“RPO”). RPO, or remaining performance obligations, represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, and includes deferred revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized in future periods.\n\nCurrent remaining performance obligations (“cRPO”). cRPO, or current RPO, represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, and includes deferred revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized in the next 12 months.\n\nNumber of customers. We define a customer as a unique account, multiple accounts containing a common non-personal email domain, or multiple accounts governed by a single agreement or entity. We believe that the number of customers using our platform is an indicator of our market penetration.\n\nNumber of customers contributing more than $10,000 in ARR. We define number of customers contributing more than $10,000 in ARR as those on a paid subscription plan that had more than $10,000 in ARR as of a period end. We view the number of customers that contribute more than $10,000 in ARR as a measure of our ability to scale with our customers and attract larger organizations. We define a customer as a unique account, multiple accounts containing a common non-personal email domain, or multiple accounts governed by a single agreement or entity. We believe this represents potential for future growth, including expanding within our current customer base.\n\nNumber of customers contributing more than $50,000 in ARR. We define number of customers contributing more than $50,000 in ARR as those on a paid subscription plan that had more than $50,000 in ARR as of a period end. We view the number of customers that contribute more than $50,000 in ARR as a measure of our ability to scale with large customers and attract sophisticated organizations. We define a customer as a unique account, multiple accounts containing a common non-personal email domain, or multiple accounts governed by a single agreement or entity. We believe this represents potential for future growth, including expanding within our current customer base.\n\nDollar-based net retention rate. We calculate dollar-based net retention rate by dividing the ARR from our customers as of December 31st in the reported year by the ARR from those same customers as of December 31st in the previous year. This calculation is net of upsells, contraction, cancellation or expansion during the period but excludes ARR from new customers. We use dollar-based net retention to evaluate the long-term value of our customer relationships, because we believe this metric reflects our ability to retain and expand subscription revenue generated from our existing customers.\n\nDollar-based net retention rate excluding SMB customers. We calculate dollar-based net retention rate excluding SMB customers by dividing the ARR from all customers excluding ARR from customers that we have identified or that self-identified as having less than 50 employees as of December 31st in the reported year by the ARR from those same customers as of December 31st of the previous year. This calculation is net of upsells, contraction, cancellation or expansion during the period but excludes ARR from new customers. We used dollar-based net retention excluding SMB customers to evaluate the long-term value of our larger customer relationships, because we believe this metric reflects our ability to retain and expand subscription revenue generated from our existing customers.\n\nWhile we no longer believe that ARR and number of customers are key performance indicators of Sprout Social’s business, these metrics are necessary for an understanding of how we define number of customers contributing over $10,000 in ARR and number of customers contributing over $50,000 in ARR. For this purpose, we define ARR as the annualized revenue run-rate of subscription agreements from all customers as of the last date of the specified period and we define a customer as a unique account, multiple accounts containing a common non-personal email domain, or multiple accounts governed by a single agreement or entity.\n\nAvailability of Information on Sprout Social’s Website and Social Media Profiles\n\nInvestors and others should note that Sprout Social routinely announces material information to investors and the marketplace using SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, webcasts and the Sprout Social Investors website.
