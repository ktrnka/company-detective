      "# [Sprout Social on 2024-02-26](https://sproutsocial.com/security/)\nA proven track-record\n\n99.99% uptime is a key performance indicator (KPI) for our Engineering group. At the time of writing, we had higher than 99.95% uptime over the prior 6 and 12 months.\n\nTransparency to customers\n\nTrust begins with open communication. We publicly share real-time system status and metrics on our Status Websites, https://www.sproutsocialstatus.com for Sprout Social and https://www.sproutadvocacystatus.com for Employee Advocacy. There we communicate incidents and planned maintenance, including any customer impact, and we display system health metrics sourced from independent third-party providers. Customers may subscribe to receive immediate SMS or email notifications of future incidents.\n\nSocial media feeds\n\nOur data ingest layer combines multiple connections to social network APIs. As partners, social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn provide us with higher levels of redundancy and access to their support teams.\n\nBackups\n\nBackups are taken frequently, encrypted in transit and at rest, and are tested regularly. Backups are kept \"off-site\" in Amazon S3 which stores files on multiple physical devices in multiple facilities offering 99.999999999% durability and 99.99% availability.\n\nTransparency to our teams\n\nInternally we practice multidisciplinary, blameless post-mortem analysis, and seek to grow our people, procedures, and systems in the aftermath of failure. Fear is the enemy of progress.\n\nIsolation\n\nOur highly distributed backend platform employs isolation design patterns to mitigate risks across components. Failures of one component rarely affect other components.\n\nRecovery point objectives (RPOs)\n\nRecovery strategies are designed to provide up-to-date RPOs at low Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs), with older data recovered against longer RTOs. This is consistent with customer expectations in Social Media, allowing customers to meet the immediate needs of their customers.\n\nDevOps best practices\n\nOur engineering team practices Infrastructure-as-code, providing correctness, consistency, testability, and speed to recovery. All 24/7/365 on-call team members are empowered to rebuild systems and topologies with full consistency. In the event of system loss, our Engineering team quickly recreates systems by executing the infrastructure code.\n\nMonitoring & on-call support\n\nWe monitor continuously from around the world, displaying, alerting, and reporting upon our entire technical environments in real-time. Supporting customers is a collaboration between our customer-facing support team and our engineering team. Specialized engineers are on call 24/7/365.\n\nWhen problems occur our teams are promptly notified, automatically provided with context, and are enabled with tools to help collaborate efficiently with peers. We employ a triage pager system to ensure alerts quickly and reliably reach engineers.\n\nEncryption at rest & in transit\n\nAll communications over public networks with Sprout Socialâs application and API utilize HTTPS with TLS 1.2 or higher enforced. All data is stored encrypted-at-rest with AES-256 or greater, including backups.\n\nSystem administration\n\nBest practices are utilized, such as least privilege, central configuration management, and stringent host and network firewall policies. Servers are patched automatically on a regular schedule, with high-priority patches applied manually out-of-cycle.\n\nThird party risk management\n\nSprout Social reviews the security posture of our critical third party product and service providers on a regular basis. Sprout Social's subprocessors are contractually required to adhere to an established set of security measures that align with industry best practices.\n\nInformation security policies & standards\n\nSprout Social has implemented a strong information security management system through a comprehensive set of policies and standards covering all aspects of security and privacy. All Employees must affirm their responsibilities in protecting customer data as part of their condition of employment.\n\nSecure support protocols\n\nOur world-class Support team follows phishing and threat-resistant protocols designed by our Security team, when conducting sensitive actions on customer accounts.\n\nOffices\n\nSprout Social offices are secured by keycard access. Office networks are segmented, centrally monitored, and protected by firewalls and Intrusion Prevention devices. Our products have no dependencies on our companyâs offices or other facilities we manage.\n\nDevices\n\nAll Sprout Social devices are inventoried with asset tags and managed with a central mobile device management (MDM) solution.\n\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA)\n\nAccount owners and administrators may require that their users leverage this additional security layer. Sprout Social supports apps like Google Authenticator and others that implement the Time-based One-time Password Algorithm (TOTP) or HMAC-based One-time Password Algorithm (HOTP) for generating passcodes.\n\nSecure credential storage\n\nAccount passwords are salted and hashed using the latest strong algorithms and approaches, which are routinely audited. No human, our staff included, can ever view them. If you lose your password, it can't be recovered and must be reset.\n\nBrute-force protections\n\nIn addition to computationally challenging hashing, our authentication services implement additional rate-limiting protections and ReCAPTCHA.\n\nApproval workflows\n\nAccount Owners and Administrators may restrict certain activities behind approval workflows. These allow for tasks to be divided amongst a team, with the peace of mind that central decision makers may review and control public-facing actions.\n\nIP restrictions\n\nSprout Social may be configured to restrict application and API access from specific IP ranges.\n\nSingle sign-on (SSO)\n\nSprout Social offers SAML 2.0 Single sign-on (SSO) for organizations that leverage this authentication service to give employees one set of login credentials to access multiple applications. Our engineering team works with customers to implement custom SSO integrations across both web and mobile.\n\nEmail signing\n\nSprout Social implements Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) to ensure emails we send are authenticated as coming from Sprout Social, helping to prevent spoofing and ensure authenticity.\n\nAccess permissions\n\nAccount Owners and Administrators may restrict access to profiles, features, actions (including read and write), and other data, by applying granular controls to users on their account.\n\nGlobal publishing pause\n\nIn times of crisis, your team has access to one button that temporarily disables any automated scheduled and queued messages from being sent by Sprout Social. This is accessible from our web and mobile applications.\n\nCustomer protection\n\nSprout Social wants to help you protect yourself from online security threats and have created resources designed to do that, including Security Best Practices and Protecting sensitive information.",

      "# [âSprout Social by Sprout Social, Inc on 2011-11-09](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sprout-social/id475307859)\nI love Sprout, I do. Iâve been using it for about 5 years and itâs a powerful tool. The app works great with an older iPhone, but if youâre using the app with an iPhone X, expect the keyboard to cover the area where you would be able to type a response. It doesnât happen all the time but when it does itâs really frustrating.\n\nI also wanted to share a Customer Care experience. Usually Sproutâs CC is amazing but we had a really weird experience yesterday. We had to reset our password like 5 times to be able to login (again, specific to the app). I donât know exactly what happened but the agent who was helping us continued to say there was nothing he could do to help, and that we were typing the password incorrectly.\n\nThere is nothing more patronizing and frustrating to receive CC that assumes you and your 4 different employees with phones are all typing the password incorrectly when the login/pass worked all all of our MacBooks. When we pushed to log a bug, the agent said âthere isnât a history of these complaints so there was nothing I could do.â\n\nAfter like 5 app uninstalls/reinstalls with all of us logged out, we finally got back into our account. I just wish that this agent would have tried to listen rather than assume we are all a bunch of idiots. Nothing worse than: âdid you try to turn it off and back on againâ when your whole team works in IT/tech.\n\nThereâs a ton of bugs within the latest update. Kicks you out if youâre not in it constantly, then doesnât open properly when youâre forced to log back in. Doesnât tag/@ properly on desktop or mobile - you have to select one platform, tag/@, duplicate and tag/@ again. Repeat the same process until all platforms are done. Their suggested scheduling times donât match the actual platforms suggested times, so youâre constantly wondering whoâs the best: the actual platform who has real time data, or a subscription based application that your company is paying $$$$$ for.\n\nThe reporting data doesnât give you any more information than what you get for free with your business accounts on your FREE platforms.\n\nYouâre paying money for a tiny bit of convenience. Thatâs it.",

      "# [What is a hashtag? on 2018-11-27](https://sproutsocial.com/glossary/hashtag/)\nA hashtag is a word or multi-word phrase which follows the # symbol.\n\nCommon hashtags include #TBT, or #PicOfTheDay.\n\nHashtags primarily support the categorization of content on social media channels, making it easier for users to search through millions of posts. With hashtags, it’s possible to track trending topics on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.\n\nHashtags are also common in marketing campaigns, as they support and optimize brand reach.\n\nThe history of the hashtag\n\nThe history of the hashtag for social media goes back to Chris Messina, former Google employee. Chris, a developer relations expert and designer suggested that Twitter should use the pound sign (#) to categorize posts for groups.\n\nMessina was the first person to use the hashtag on a social platform and users began to follow suit. It took a little while for the trend to catch on, but today, the hashtag has moved beyond Twitter to appear on every social channel.\n\nHow to use a hashtag\n\nHashtags are everywhere.\n\nOn the surface, using a hashtag is simple – all you need to do is add the “#” sign before a word or phrase. However, for a hashtag to be effective at supporting a brand’s marketing campaigns, it needs a specific strategy. The basic rules of hashtags include:\n\nHashtags must be accurate and relevant to the content of the post. Irrelevant hashtags look spammy and reduce the authority of the material.\n\nCombine branded and unbranded hashtags. The best social posts include trending tags and unique, shareable tags.\n\nDon’t be too clever or go too long. Hashtags need to be short and easy to understand. Make it easy for people to re-use your tags.\n\nUse hashtags wisely. Don’t put more hashtags than words in a single post.\n\nDo not use spaces in your hashtags. If you need to use multiple words, just connect them together like #ThrowBackThursday.\n\nIf you’re struggling to find current hashtags, examine trending topics and social influencer posts.\n\nWhy do people use hashtags?\n\nSocial media users haven’t always had hashtags to organize their posts.\n\nThe hashtag has become more popular over the years as more people have swarmed onto social platforms. With so much new content posted every day, a hashtag makes it easier to find and discuss the topics that are most important to you.\n\nHashtags:\n\nImprove the reach of your social media posts by ensuring you get in front of the right audiences and into the right searches.\n\nIncrease your chances of connecting with influencers: Using the same branded tags as social influencers forms initial connections with future partners.\n\nHashtags make it easier to track campaigns and branded mentions. With branded hashtags, you’ll see which people are talking about your company.\n\nHelp to build connections with your target audience: Hashtags are a way to resonate with the right people on social media.\n\nGive you new ways to engage on social media: With hashtags, companies often run social media contests, #Sweepstakes and more to delight their audience.\n\nThe key to a successful hashtag campaign is finding the right tags and committing to proper planning.",
      "# [What is EdgeRank? on 2019-12-17](https://sproutsocial.com/glossary/edgerank/)\nFacebook EdgeRank was another name for the old Facebook algorithm.\n\nThe Facebook algorithm determines how posts are presented to your potential customers and followers. EdgeRank and the newer algorithms use a multitude of mathematical variables and operations to measure the popularity and potential of the material you create for social media.\n\nAccording to Facebook, their algorithm delivers the content that customers most want to see. In recent years, this has lead to a reduced focus on promoted content, and a higher level of priority given to organic material on Facebook.\n\nHow did EdgeRank work?\n\nEdgerank was designed by Serkan Piantino to help organize the masses of material published to Facebook every day. In 2011, Facebook stopped using the EdgeRank system and started to use machine learning algorithms instead.\n\nThe adoption of machine learning means that the new Facebook algorithm is capable of becoming more intelligent and accurate over time. In 2013, the learning algorithm assessed more than 100,000 factors when ranking content. Since then, the level of data that goes into the Facebook algorithm has continued to grow.\n\nThe EdgeRank formula used three main factors to arrange material on your Facebook feed, including:\n\nThe freshness or recency of a post\n\nThe actions taken by users on the post (engagement such as likes, comments and shares)\n\nUser affinity – the relationship between the person viewing the post and the company or individual that published the material.\n\nWhat happened to EdgeRank?\n\nEdgerank was replaced by the machine learning algorithm that Facebook uses today, to ensure that the social channel could deliver the highest quality of content for users. In 2018, Facebook announced that it would be pushing back against branded content and giving audiences more of the authentic, valuable posts they were looking for on the channel.\n\nDespite this, Facebook continues to deliver one of the best ROIs for social media marketers, thanks to the size of the network’s user base.\n\nThe latest algorithm is very similar to Edgerank, as it still considers the “affinity” between people when determining where content should rank. The new algorithm also values genuine engagement too. This means that companies can achieve more considerable attention online by encouraging people to like and comment on their posts.\n\nWhenever the algorithm updates, it means that companies on Facebook need to come up with a new plan for interacting with followers online. In the case of the most recent update, some key tips include:",
      "# [What is crowdsourcing? on 2018-10-16](https://sproutsocial.com/glossary/crowdsourcing/)\nCrowdsourcing is the act of collecting services, ideas or content through the contributions of a large group of people. Typically, the “crowd” in crowdsourcing is a third-party unrelated to the business seeking results. You may crowdsource insights from customers and online communities, rather than employees or shareholders.\n\nThe term “crowdsourcing” first appeared in a Wired article by Jeff Howe in 2006. The word highlighted a new way of connecting with people willing to work collaboratively on a project.\n\nTypes of crowdsourcing\n\nCrowdsourcing is a rapidly growing industry with multiple subsections. The kind of crowdsourcing you choose will depend on the outcome you’re looking for:\n\nCrowdfunding: With crowdfunding, large groups of people come together to fund a project. Kickstarter is a popular example of a crowdfunding platform.\n\nCrowdwisdom: In Crowdwisdom, companies seek out the input and opinions of large groups of people. Sites like Yahoo Answers or InnoCentive allow people to share their thoughts on complex topics.\n\nMicrotasking: Microtasking breaks a massive project down into multiple small tasks ready to be assigned to a crowd. For instance, if you wanted a design for your new cup like Starbucks did in 2014, you might ask your customers to create compositions and vote on their favorites for you. That’s precisely what happened with the Starbucks white cup contest.\n\nThe benefits of crowdsourcing\n\nCrowdsourcing offers significant benefits to companies hoping to complete complex tasks on a budget. Additionally, asking for the wisdom and input of the crowd elevates customer engagement and improve brand reputation. Crowdsourcing:\n\nKeeps customers engaged: Crowdsourcing shows your audience that you value their opinion, leading to stronger brand connections. Additionally, customers are more likely to feel involved with campaign concepts, service ideas and products they helped to create.\n\nPromotes innovation & diversity: Accessing the thoughts of a broad group of diverse people allows for more out-of-the-box thinking. Crowdsourced concepts access the wisdom of groups to help companies innovate.\n\nSaves time and money: Connecting with dozens or even hundreds of professionals is typically expensive. However, bringing people together digitally reduces cost and widens the parameters for input.\n\nAttracts ambassadors: If crowdsourcing collects enough positive enthusiasm from your audience, participants evolve into brand ambassadors. Your new ambassadors may be an excellent source of word of mouth marketing.\n\nTips for better crowdsourcing\n\nCrowdsourcing is an excellent way to overcome challenges and simultaneously create buzz for your brand. However, like any company campaign, crowdsourcing requires careful planning and strategy. Make sure you:",

      "# [What is a microblog? on 2018-08-03](https://sproutsocial.com/glossary/microblog/)\nA microblog is a short piece of content designed for quick audience interactions.\n\nMicroblogging is a combination of instant messaging and content production. With a microblog, you share short messages with an online audience to improve engagement. Social channels like Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest offer popular platforms for microblogging.\n\nWhat Does a Microblog Look Like?\n\nMicroblogging makes it easier to communicate with audiences quickly. Rather than writing pages of text, a micro blog allows for quick, conversational connections with customers.\n\nShort microblogging messages appear in various content formats, including audio, video, images and text. The trend for microblogging began when social media emerged to provide quicker ways for companies to engage customers. Microblogging also keeps customers informed about the longer content on your website.\n\nTypes of Microblogging Platforms\n\nMost brands already use microblogging platforms in their content plans.\n\nAs more customers look to develop relationships with companies, short and frequent social posts are critical. Additionally, microblogging appeals to the mobile browsing community. Examples of microblogging platforms include:\n\nTwitter: One of the best-known channels in the microblogging world. Twitter is a quick and convenient way to share short posts, GIFs, article links, videos and more.\n\nPinterest: Companies on Pinterest link to products, articles and other useful information for audiences. Descriptions allow for quick content connections.\n\nInstagram: A visual form of microblogging, Instagram allows organizations to share stories and snaps as part of an online narrative.\n\nFacebook: One of the most popular social platforms, Facebook is an effective microblog channel. Users share text, live videos and more to connect with customers.\n\nTumblr: Tumblr is another highly popular microblogging platform. You can tag specific topics to attract attention from targeted audiences.\n\nBenefits of Microblogging\n\nMost companies are already microblogging without realizing it.\n\nA microblogging strategy is a critical part of building connections with modern audiences. Some of the benefits of a microblog include:\n\nFrequent posts: Consistency is key in content marketing. Microblogging allows companies to share shorter content faster. This creates more conversational connections with customers.\n\nLess time developing content: Some companies struggle to create lengthy article content regularly. Microblogs maintain relationships in between longer blog, video and infographic posts.\n\nReal-time sharing: In a fast-paced environment, microblogging allows companies to share time-sensitive information. A quick tweet tells an audience about a sale, breaking news and other crucial updates.\n\nMicroblogging for a Mobile Audience\n\n52.2% of website traffic worldwide was generated by mobile devices in 2018.\n\nAs audiences continue to turn to mobile solutions as an immediate source of information, microblogging is critical. Consumers find it difficult to interact with lengthy posts on mobile. However, microblogs offer instant access to updates and trending news. A microblog strengthens brand relationships in the mobile world.\n\nMany microblogging platforms also offer opportunity for two-way interactions. Microblogging channels like Twitter facilitate interactions through comments, retweets, liking and more. Used correctly, a microblog facilitates greater engagement than a traditional post.",

      "# [Customer satisfaction score (CSAT): What it is and how to measure it by Dorcas Adisa on 2023-09-20](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/csat/)\nCustomer satisfaction has become an indispensable factor in sustainable business growth.\n\nCustomers now wield more power than ever before and have endless product options. Competition has become increasingly stiff, and only brands focusing on building customer relationships and a loyal following are poised for long-term success. Our survey data shows that 58% of people buy from brands they trust, and 36% choose brands that genuinely understand their needs.\n\nIn this article, we answer everything you need to know about customer satisfaction score (CSAT). We’ll discuss its importance and how to calculate it. Further, we’ll also share strategies to help you improve your CSAT score.\n\nTable of contents:\n\nWhat is CSAT?\n\nHow to calculate CSAT\n\nAlternatives to using CSAT\n\nBenefits of using CSAT\n\nTips for improving CSAT\n\nWhat is CSAT?\n\nA customer satisfaction score, or CSAT, is a customer service metric designed to measure customers’ happiness and satisfaction with a company’s product or service. More than a customer service metric, a customer satisfaction score can be described as a tool that makes it possible for businesses to:\n\nMeasure the quality of customer experience delivered to their customers\n\nCollect user feedback on your brand, product or service\n\nPredict the likelihood of customers churning\n\nCollect data on customer expectations and develop features to meet such expectations.\n\nCSAT is measured individually, meaning the feedback is collected from individual customers at different stages of the customer survey. Companies use CSAT surveys to ask customers simple feedback questions such as “How satisfied are you with your experience?” or “How would you rate our product/service?”\n\nCSAT survey measures satisfaction level on a scale containing either binary response (yes/no), an emoticon scale (😁 or 😞) or on a 5-point or 7-point Likert scale (e.g. 1- Strongly disagree to 5- Strongly agree). You can place these surveys strategically through emails, in-app or online feedback to collect customer feedback.\n\nHow to calculate CSAT\n\nCalculating your CSAT score is quite straightforward. With a CSAT survey, you can ask customers to rate your products or services using a scaled-based response system.\n\nWhen the results are in, you simply divide the total number of happy responses (ratings from 8-10) by the total number of customers surveyed and then multiply by 10.\n\nLet’s assume you receive 150 positive responses from a pool of 250 respondents, your CSAT score would be 60%. Breaking it down,\n\nA CSAT score is calculated on a zero-to-one scale, with 100 percent being the highest score. For many companies, achieving 100% is the goal. However, that is not to say that any score exceeding 50% (ideally 60% or 70%) should not be viewed as positive.\n\nWhile achieving a 100% CSAT score is commendable, it’s also important to benchmark it against other metrics. Compare the total number of CSAT responses you’ve received to the total number of your customers. This way, you can tell if your CSAT score is truly an indicator of your overall customer satisfaction.\n\nFor example, if 100 of your 250 responses are positive, but you have a total of 1,000 customers, then your CSAT score is not a true representation of your customer satisfaction level.\n\nHow to calculate customer satisfaction using Sprout Social\n\nSprout Social users can use the customer feedback tool to build customer satisfaction surveys and collect customer feedback from social platforms. To create customer feedback in Sprout, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1. Log In to your Sprout Social account.\n\nStep 2. Next, access customer feedback configuration. Do this by navigating to “Account and Settings” section. Click on settings.\n\nStep 3. Under “Inbox and reviews,” select customer feedback. Choose the social profile for which you want to configure your CSAT survey.\n\nStep 4. Select the Enable feedback checkbox to configure your survey. Scroll down to the survey section. Here, you can set up CSAT surveys for Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.\n\nStep 5. To automatically send a request for feedback, select Automate.\n\nStep 6. Once you’re done, you can click “Save” to save your settings or “Reset Settings” to start over. You can also customize the appearance of your CSAT survey by selecting Customize under Appearance.\n\nOnce you’ve configured your CSAT survey, Sprout Social will automatically send a feedback request to customers after they interact with your brand on social media. You can view your CSAT results in the Customer Feedback Report. This report shows you the average CSAT score for each social media platform, as well as the percentage of customers who rated their satisfaction as “Very Satisfied.”\n\nAnalyze the results in the Customer Service Feedback Report to gain insights into your CSAT scores and make data-driven decisions to improve your customer experience.\n\nAlternatives to CSAT\n\nBusinesses use customer satisfaction metrics like customer satisfaction score (CSAT), Net Promoter Score (NPS) and Customer Effort Score (CES) depending on the goal they want to achieve. Let’s discuss two alternatives to CSAT.\n\nNet Promoter Score (NPS)\n\nNet Promoter Score (NPS) is a customer satisfaction metric that measures the possibility of users recommending your products to others on a scale of 0-10. It is measured to gauge customer sentiment and loyalty by asking one question: “How likely are you to recommend {product name} to a friend or colleague? ”\n\nNPS scores are good predictors of business growth; a high score indicates a healthy customer relationship, while lower scores say otherwise. With NPS surveys, you can track how certain interactions in the customer journey, for example, feature upgrades, affect customer loyalty over time.\n\nCustomer Effort Score (CES)\n\nThe Customer Effort Score Metric, or CES, is a metric used to evaluate the ease of a customer’s experience with a company. It measures how much effort customers put into interacting with a product to achieve their desired outcome, whether purchasing, resolving an issue or getting support.\n\nCES survey typically asks questions such as “On a scale of 1-5, how easy was it to {experience}?” The score is typically measured on a 5-point or 7-point scale, ranging from “very difficult to very easy.” By measuring CES scores, companies can pinpoint areas where customers are experiencing difficulty and where there’s a need for improvement to make the experience seamless for their customers.\n\n5 benefits of using CSAT\n\nNow that we’ve covered the definitions, let’s understand why you should start using CSAT.\n\n1. CSAT is intuitive and easy to use\n\nCSAT surveys are designed in a way that is easy to understand. They’re user-friendly, easy to understand and can be customized easily without much difficulty. CSAT survey often comes with one question that’s easy to understand and feels interactive to the respondent.\n\n2. Higher response rates\n\nBecause CSAT surveys are short and straight to the point, they usually have a higher response rate. They require minimal time and effort from the customer, and as long as they appear contextually, customers won’t mind sharing their opinions.\n\n3. CSAT allows for more versatile questions\n\nCSAT allows you to ask questions in various ways and based on various experiences, which makes it adaptable to different customer interactions. Its versatility can be valuable when collecting insights from multiple customer experiences and tailoring questions to suit the specific context and goals. For instance, you can tailor one CSAT survey to analyze your customer service and feature interactions.\n\n4. CSAT is better for specific experiences or features\n\nCSAT is suitable for evaluating specific experiences (e.g., onboarding) or product or service features. Every aspect of your product matters, and with CSAT, you can measure how satisfied customers are with that particular aspect of your product offering rather than the overall experience. Address areas with low CSAT scores and clear out friction points to improve the customer experience and satisfaction.\n\n5. Less customer churn\n\nA higher customer satisfaction score leads to higher customer retention and a lower churn rate. Customers come for the product but stay for the experience. A higher satisfaction score indicates that customers are satisfied and will remain loyal to your company.\n\n8 tips for improving CSAT\n\nAchieving a high CSAT score is the primary goal of every organization, but as lovely as that sounds it doesn’t happen overnight. You need to be consistent and apply the following best practices to consistently provide customers with the best experience.\n\n1. Ask the right questions\n\nThe success of a customer satisfaction survey depends on the questions you ask. Good questions should be easy to understand, be answered in a short time and remain relevant to their purpose. The right questions yield accurate responses, but poorly crafted ones can have adverse effects. They introduce survey bias, lower response rates and compromise data quality.\n\nIdentifying bad questions can be challenging, as they often hide in plain sight. So, here’s what you should watch out for:\n\nUsing biased language to prompt positive responses.\n\nQuestions with difficult wordings\n\nAsking vague, complex or ambiguous questions\n\nOverloading respondents with too many questions at once\n\nUsing double negative in your questions\n\nWhen building your survey, frame your questions carefully. Guide users to answer questions, without imposing any expectations on them.\n\n2. Send feedback contextually\n\nSending feedback contextually means your CSAT survey appears when it is relevant to a specific touchpoint in a customer’s journey. This could be after a customer completes a specific action you’re collecting feedback on or after they pass a new milestone. This real-time approach captures fresh, unfiltered customer opinions, providing more reliable data.\n\nAt Sprout, we use microsurveys at different customer touchpoints to collect feedback contextually. For instance, you’d typically find microsurveys placed after our customer support articles and as you use our product in-app.\n\nThis feedback is more effective and actionable because it directly relates to a specific experience, making it easier for our team to understand and act on it meaningfully.\n\n3. Set appropriate goals for your CSAT\n\nSince customer satisfaction (CSAT) is not as evident to stakeholders as customer acquisition, it’s often overlooked when it comes to setting goals. Creating CSAT goals is the first step to successful goal achievement. It gives your team a sense of direction and aligns your team’s actions with your business goals.\n\nA couple of goals you might consider setting include:\n\nIncreasing your CSAT score by a certain percentage by the end of the quarter\n\nReducing churn and increasing customer retention by a certain percentage by the end of the year\n\n4. Create a support omnichannel\n\nImplementing a seamless customer support system across various communication channels can significantly improve customer satisfaction. Customers expect a fast response from your support team regardless of the channel they contact for assistance.\n\nWant to create an Omnichannel support experience? Here’s what it involves:\n\nIntegrate multiple support channels like email, phone calls and social media chat to access customer data across all channels.\n\nUse customer data to personalize interactions and create an omnichannel customer experience\n\nImprove your issue resolution time by equipping your customer support agents with the right tools.\n\nClose the feedback loop by implementing feedback requests and updating the customers afterward.\n\nInvest in an advanced tool like Sprout Social to have a centralized view of your customer data.\n\n5. Use feedback to improve your product or service\n\nKnowing your CSAT score and collecting customer feedback will do no good if you don’t act on it. Feedback reveals what you’re doing right, product weaknesses and areas for improvement. This allows you to adjust your product expectations and fine-tune your customer experience strategy going forward.\n\nAfter gathering feedback, analyze it for insights. Look for patterns, trends, opportunities and gaps your team may have overlooked. Tools like Sprout’s customer feedback report are used to organize, filter and categorize feedback by user segments.\n\nPrioritize feedback that requires immediate action (e.g., bug fixes) and act on it. Categorize other feedback based on alignment with your current business goals, available resources and priorities. Include all these in a product roadmap for further research or validation in future development.\n\n6. Reduce response times\n\nSlow support response times can result in companies losing the trust and loyalty of their customers. Customers are highly impatient, and a slow response time comes with the consequence of a poor satisfaction score. In our 2022 Sprout Social Index, we discovered that customers expect quick responses: 40% within the first hour on social and 79% within the first 24 hours.\n\nTo speed up response time, offer self-service options like a resource center with FAQs, videos and chatbots. Brands use Sprout Social’s Bot Builder to automate their conversational workflow on social. Using Sprout’s Bot Builder for customer service, you can build a chatbot, preview it and then deploy it within minutes.\n\n7. Address negative feedback\n\nReceiving negative feedback is not easy for anyone. It can make us defensive, frustrated or angry. As a brand, receiving negative feedback is inevitable, no matter how hard you try to please your customers. These reviews can come from social media comments, review sites or even your CSAT surveys.\n\nWhen you receive a negative review, don’t get defensive; negative feedback is not a personal attack on you or your brand. Listen carefully to the customer’s complaint and understand what happened and why it happened. Then, reach out to the customer and take responsibility. This can be done through email or by handling your feedback through Sprout.\n\nSprout’s Smart Inbox brings together comments and messages from multiple social media platforms into a single dashboard so you can monitor, view and respond to customers. What’s more, you can also monitor your notifications and brand mentions to catch negative feedback.\n\n8. Measure your CSAT score regularly\n\nMeasuring your CSAT is not a one-time thing; it’s continuous. As you would measure and set financial goals for your brand, also set goals for improving your CSAT on a bi-monthly, quarterly or annual basis. Create a roadmap for the long run and set measures to:\n\nReview your CSAT and come up with better means for distribution (e.g., in-app, email, knowledgebase articles, etc.)\n\nCompare past and present CSAT scores to get an overview of current changes\n\nSet up one-on-one interviews with power users and churned users to find out your strengths and weaknesses.\n\nDocument previous actions and their effectiveness on your CSAT score (e.g. Did adding more support channels improve our CSAT score? )\n\nCreate a customer service report to document your process and results.\n\nUse CSAT to improve your customer satisfaction\n\nWhile exceeding customer satisfaction is the end-goal, sending out surveys, analyzing the results and finding patterns in your customer satisfaction score is extremely stressful, especially if you have a growing customer base. You need the right tool to automate this task so you can focus on achieving other important tasks in your business.",

      "# [What is a Regram? on 2018-10-16](https://sproutsocial.com/glossary/regram/)\nSharing and creating content is a crucial part of social media marketing. A Regram is an effective way to share content on Instagram. Regramming allows brands to distribute another user’s posts on their own feed, similar to retweeting. The main difference between Regramming and retweeting is that Instagram doesn’t have a dedicated button to support the Regram.\n\nBusinesses can Regram content either manually, or through third-party tools like Sprout Social. Instagram deliberately avoids giving companies a way to instantly share content because they want social material to be authentic and “in the moment.”\n\nRegram etiquette\n\nBrands Regram content to support their brand reputation or credibility. Regramming a post by a social influencer that shows that person wearing or using your product is a valuable form of social proof.\n\nRegramming comes with a series of unique concerns for companies to consider, however. Unlike with Facebook and Twitter, Regramming Instagram content means re-sharing someone’s photography. It’s essential for brands to ensure they’re not stealing the assets of another user. This means companies must:\n\nCredit the original user by tagging the content creator: The #Regram hashtag is a popular accessory to attribution.\n\nAsk the content creator for permission to repost and respect the decision that individual makes: Usually, permission to Regram will be dependent on how you plan to use the content.\n\nComply with any guidelines the original creator has: This means not editing or changing the content in any way and respecting the creator’s wishes.\n\nFlatter the content creator when Regramming: Let your audience know who created the piece and why you value it.\n\nGo beyond the Regram: Don’t rely entirely on Regrammed content for your Instagram profile. Remember to create and share unique posts too.\n\nHow to regram\n\nThere are various ways to Regram content. One of the most popular options is to Regram manually. To Regram manually, take a screenshot on your smartphone of the content you want to use and click on the camera button to upload the screenshot to Instagram. Be sure to crop the image, so you exclude everything but the original image. Instagram’s native tools make this simple.\n\nAlternatively, if you’d prefer a simpler way to Regram content, Sprout Social now allows users to repost quickly and easily.

      "# [What is Doomscrolling? on 2022-07-06](https://sproutsocial.com/glossary/doomscrolling/)\nThere are nearly 5 billion social media users around the world! Yes, you read that correctly. Social media has become one of the most influential methods of communication for people of all generations.\n\nWhile there are many benefits to social media, inevitable downsides have also emerged. One such negative is doomscrolling.\n\nWhat Is Doomscrolling?\n\nHave you found yourself consistently reading negative articles or posts on social networks? This is called doomscrolling.\n\nDoomscrolling is when one decides to read depressing content and does not even notice that they continue to read such content.\n\nThe term doomscrolling has been around for a while but has increased in popularity due to traumatic events like the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe psychological effects of doomscrolling\n\nDoomscrolling can cause people to compare themselves to others more than ever. This creates unobtainable, unfair and intimidating social standards.\n\nIn turn, social media users of all ages and backgrounds have begun to feel undeniable pressure. Younger people especially pre-teens, teenagers, and individuals in their 20s and 30s can become more depressed and lonely due to doomscrolling.\n\nWhy does doomscrolling occur?\n\nResearch has suggested that people doomscroll as a means of control. There is so much in this world that one cannot control, but when and why they acquire knowledge is one such thing that is controllable.\n\nPeople believe the more educated they are, the better prepared they will be for dire situations. What they do not recognize is that doomscrolling negatively affects their mental state. Consistent depressing news will of course result in negative emotions and feelings.\n\nEliminating your doomscrolling will improve your overall mental wellbeing. The good news is there are steps you can take to ween yourself off this unhealthy habit.\n\nHow to stop doomscrolling?\n\nOne of the first steps you can take to improve your doom surfing is to carefully select your sources. Chose a source you trust and a source that has a positive reputation.\n\nThe sources you use must be factual, but they also should not have a negative bias. Often, major sources write articles with a negative lens as a scare factor.\n\nWhen searching the web, limit your screen time. Allow yourself a specific amount of time to read the content you desire and then force yourself to move on to a different activity. This will take discipline, but it’s worth your while.\n\nWhen reviewing content on the web, place effort into selecting more upbeat content. You control what you view. Reading more positive articles or watching uplifting content can make a world of difference.\n\nCreate more responsible content\n\nSince doomscrolling can have such an effect on your mental state, it is imperative that you are proactive and take steps to limit or eliminate this behavior.\n\nCompanies can create engaging and positive content with Sprout Social. When businesses create meaningful content with good intentions, people can be exposed to healthier content.",
      "# [What is BeReal? on 2022-04-29](https://sproutsocial.com/glossary/bereal/)\nBeReal is a photo-sharing application that allows users to post one photo per day to show their followers what they are doing in real-time. The BeReal app focuses on authenticity and asks users to be real. Because the app allows everyone to post only once a day, users can avoid being on the application for multiple hours throughout the day, making the app stand out from social media platforms currently dominant in the space.\n\nWhat is BeReal?\n\nThe social media application available for download on Android and IOS devices was founded in December 2019 by Alexis Barreyat. The app encourages users to share who they are in the moment. The app is the latest trending social media application that is quickly growing in interest and downloads.\n\nHow does the BeReal app work?\n\nUsers receive a notification at a random time once a day saying ‘Time to BeReal’. This opens up a two-minute window for the user to post a picture of what they are currently doing. The purpose of this is to capture an authentic, unfiltered snapshot of a user’s life.\n\nIf users post outside of the two-minute window, they will be considered late and will not be able to see others’ photo until after they’ve posted. After posting, users will also gain access to the app’s Discover section.\n\nUsers can retake their photos, however, the app will show the number of times a user retakes an image. The app also reveals the number of times the user tried to capture their BeReal moment.\n\nWhile there is not a ‘like’ option available on the app, users can react to other posts by using their RealMoji, or an emoji featuring their selfie mimicking an emoji reaction. The app has no filters or edit buttons and does not allow videos to be posted. Follower count is also not displayed on the app and neither are ads.",

I’ve been using it for about 5 years and it’s a powerful tool. The app works great with an older iPhone, but if you’re using the app with an iPhone X, expect the keyboard to cover the area where you would be able to type a response. It doesn’t happen all the time but when it does it’s really frustrating.  \n\nI also wanted to share a Customer Care experience. Usually Sprout’s CC is amazing but we had a really weird experience yesterday. We had to reset our password like 5 times to be able to login (again, specific to the app). I don’t know exactly what happened but the agent who was helping us continued to say there was nothing he could do to help, and that we were typing the password incorrectly. \n\nThere is nothing more patronizing and frustrating to receive CC that assumes you and your 4 different employees with phones are all typing the password incorrectly when the login/pass worked all all of our MacBooks. When we pushed to log a bug, the agent said “there isn’t a history of these complaints so there was nothing I could do.” \n\nAfter like 5 app uninstalls/reinstalls with all of us logged out, we finally got back into our account. I just wish that this agent would have tried to listen rather than assume we are all a bunch of idiots. Nothing worse than: “did you try to turn it off and back on again” when your whole team works in IT/tech.",

It makes easier to manage multiple Twitter accounts, which is a feature I've been struggling with on every other Twitter app I've tried. One of my favorite features if the Tasks tab; I can see tasks that my team assigns to me, and vice versa. It also shows completed tasks, which is helpful. I like that it also lets you post to Facebook. I was surprised with the \"Where are you?\" feature that is very FourSquare-y; I haven't yet played with that but can see myself using it to give messages context. Again, this app is beautifully designed, which makes it even more enjoyable to use (for me)."

I’ve been using it for about 5 years and it’s a powerful tool. The app works great with an older iPhone, but if you’re using the app with an iPhone X, expect the keyboard to cover the area where you would be able to type a response. It doesn’t happen all the time but when it does it’s really frustrating.  \n\nI also wanted to share a Customer Care experience. Usually Sprout’s CC is amazing but we had a really weird experience yesterday. We had to reset our password like 5 times to be able to login (again, specific to the app). I don’t know exactly what happened but the agent who was helping us continued to say there was nothing he could do to help, and that we were typing the password incorrectly. \n\nThere is nothing more patronizing and frustrating to receive CC that assumes you and your 4 different employees with phones are all typing the password incorrectly when the login/pass worked all all of our MacBooks. When we pushed to log a bug, the agent said “there isn’t a history of these complaints so there was nothing I could do.” \n\nAfter like 5 app uninstalls/reinstalls with all of us logged out, we finally got back into our account. I just wish that this agent would have tried to listen rather than assume we are all a bunch of idiots.

One of my favorite features if the Tasks tab; I can see tasks that my team assigns to me, and vice versa. It also shows completed tasks, which is helpful. I like that it also lets you post to Facebook. I was surprised with the \"Where are you?\" feature that is very FourSquare-y; I haven't yet played with that but can see myself using it to give messages context. Again, this app is beautifully designed, which makes it even more enjoyable to use (for me).",

They introduced me to Sprout before they left. Since taking over I’ve noticed something odd. Sprout suggests our Instagram has a 0.0% ER which is virtually impossible. I dug into it and realized the problem was that when they calculated ER (per impression) they counted paid and organic impressions but only organic engagement so we have an obscene amount of impressions (mainly from ads) but a comparatively very small amount of engagement, which is why it registers as 0.0%. I brought it up to our account manager at Sprout and was basically told that they can’t separate the impressions. This seems like a massive oversight. Has anyone else experienced this? I don’t mind Sprout but I have to manually calculate our ER every time now and I find it hard to believe that no one else has ever brought this to their attention.\n\n\n\n## Comment ID i90pmdl with +2 score by [(ScarletBurn, Reddit, 2022-05-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/urya3h/does_anyone_use_sprout_social/i90pmdl/) (in reply to ID urya3h):\nA bit off topic (sorry) but I wasn't able to use Sprout Social because it was WAY too expensive for all of the Instagram accounts I run.

This is because you can't adjust the post to fit with different platform requirements. So you'd have to either create one post to all platforms and not have it adjusted for each platform (tags, hashtags, character limit etc). OR create the same post 3 or 4 times over for different platforms.\n\nWith other tools I've used you can individually tweak within the one post.

You'll pay less, and when you use a company that focuses on one thing, they'll typically be better at that thing then a company that tries to do everything.\n\n### Comment ID jvenhsy with +2 score by [(TheFoodieBoy, Reddit, 2023-08-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/15gb8zr/need_to_get_rid_of_sprout_social/jvenhsy/) (in reply to ID juo4zbu):\nBut isn't the whole idea to eliminate point solutions?\n\n#### Comment ID jvgnnpk with +1 score by [(jasonyormark, Reddit, 2023-08-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/15gb8zr/need_to_get_rid_of_sprout_social/jvgnnpk/) (in reply to ID jvenhsy):\nPoint solutions?\n\n## Comment ID l817xpm with +1 score by [(prostartme, Reddit, 2024-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/15gb8zr/need_to_get_rid_of_sprout_social/l817xpm/) (in reply to ID 15gb8zr):\nWe at RecurPost charge 4 bucks a month for each profile you manage.

You can also schedule your own posts within Instagram. Doing it all correctly is a lot of work though so consider that and the learning curve.

With it, you can add any public profiles for tracking (be it your own followers or those of competitors) and receive weekly reports on what hashtags and posts they like, their new followings and unfollowings, as well as general interests. This will allow you to better understand the media behavior of your target audience and adjust your strategy.

It is a huge pain and takes a lot of time I could spend doing something else. \n\nYou cannot filter posts by date. Say you want to see all content for one specific date, cannot do that. You can only filter by account and social. \n\nCalendar view is mostly useless. You can see the number of posts on any give day, but you cannot preview said posts. \n\nAnalytics is severely underdeveloped. Also, you cannot freely compare date rage. Say you want to compare April 2022 va April 2023, it is not something that you can do. You can only choose a date range and compare to the previous period, which is mostly useless for us. \n\nYou cannot schedule stories, reels, tiktok is not supported, Google business profile is not supported. \n\nIf you have a choice, don’t use HubSpot for your social media.

It's ironic for such a marketing driven company but they seem to think they are competing with CRMs and have almost nothing to offer for Social.  You can do more with the free version of Hootsuite.\n\n## Comment ID jxxs4wj with +2 score by [(TheFoodieBoy, Reddit, 2023-08-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/162ik7d/hubspot_vs_sprout_social_which_is_better_for/jxxs4wj/) (in reply to ID 162ik7d):\nIf you're a sml size company then there hubspot but if you're enterprise then sprinklr.is the top dog. 300$ a month and you get almost all the add ons that sprout charges extra for including listening. Also, never seen anyone use hubspot for social media management\n\n## Comment ID jxzfy0x with +2 score by [(xmasonx75, Reddit, 2023-08-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/162ik7d/hubspot_vs_sprout_social_which_is_better_for/jxzfy0x/) (in reply to ID 162ik7d):\nThey both suck tbh\n\n## Comment ID koxm8yr with +1 score by [(3ASYW1N, Reddit, 2024-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/162ik7d/hubspot_vs_sprout_social_which_is_better_for/koxm8yr/) (in reply to ID 162ik7d):\nIf you have not checked it out yet or committed to a service, I would suggest looking into Synup Social. We migrated over to them for social media management and engagement. It’s affordable and allows the integration of multiple accounts into a centralized location. Very user friendly and visually pleasing reports.",
      "# Post ID eytchi: Pushing WordPress posts to social via Sprout Social - possible? with +2 score by [(peet1188, Reddit, 2020-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/eytchi/pushing_wordpress_posts_to_social_via_sprout/)\nIs there a WordPress plug-in, etc. for pushing WordPress posts to social via Sprout Social? I noticed there's something available for HootSuite and wanted to know if Sprout can do the same.\n\n## Comment ID fgj749y with +1 score by [(David_M_Digital, Reddit, 2020-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/eytchi/pushing_wordpress_posts_to_social_via_sprout/fgj749y/) (in reply to ID eytchi):\nI actually just asked their support as I was curious about this myself. Thanks for prompting me! \n\nYour options according to sprout are:\n\n1. Their chrome extension\n2. A publish via RSS feed (but it's only capable of sending from twitter)\n3. Integrate feedly with sprout to send content to compose (uh)\n\nI just do it manually, i know it's a bit of extra work but you at least get the flexibility of sprouts publishing options. None of these other methods seem all that great TBH.\n\nHope this helps!\n\n### Comment ID fgkqxbk with +1 score by [(peet1188, Reddit, 2020-02-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/eytchi/pushing_wordpress_posts_to_social_via_sprout/fgkqxbk/) (in reply to ID fgj749y):\nVery informative - thanks!\n\n## Comment ID fglhwhf with +1 score by [(usamaejazch, Reddit, 2020-02-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/eytchi/pushing_wordpress_posts_to_social_via_sprout/fglhwhf/) (in reply to ID eytchi):\nCan you not publish from RSS feed?"

You may get a stock grant, but it's just a millstone to keep working for a company that doesn't care about you. \n\nAfter a change in Marketing leadership, a decline in employee engagement, and general attrition throughout the year, there were promises made that things would get better. That management would take employee feedback seriously and implement change. \n\nThe single change was an update to the career bands structure, which is actually worse than it was before. There's no longer a competency for bringing 'business value'. The emphasis is much more on communication and collaboration, which is incredibly challenging at a company with so much organizational debt that getting anything done requires moving mountains. With these new bands, any actual work that moved the company forward and drove revenue will slow as everyone ensures they don't step on anyone's toes and risk that promotion.\n\nThe only time where you can get any change in role and significant increase in salary is during the annual review (which is held each April, a solid 4 months after the year has ended). If you just come short, or if you get feedback you weren't expecting, prepare to wait 12 more months for any meaningful salary change.\n\nIt seems like they're doing as much as they can to not promote employees or give them additional compensation.

I appreciate the investment you’ve made in Sprout over the years, and I wanted you to know that I read your review and I hear you.\n\nWe value recognizing great work at Sprout. For that reason, all team members are evaluated at least once a year for merit increases, which are based on performance, market rate and time since last increase, as well as promotions, which are based on a combination of performance and business need. Quarterly Check-ins, which we just completed in July, are also dedicated time to discuss your performance and career development goals with your manager. \n\nThe refreshed Marketing career bands are designed to provide more clear and specific guidance based on industry and Sprout standards. Business impact is incorporated throughout the competencies, on which all team members were invited to provide feedback before they were finalized. Bands are just one part of career development, and we’re proud to have rolled out several new programs including Grow@Sprout professional development awards for conferences and courses, Marketing department-wide study groups on topics team members are most interested in, self-paced learning through our ANA sponsorship, and more.\n\nI encourage you to work with your manager on how the updated career bands apply to your role and the important business impact you make at Sprout. If those conversations aren’t feeling productive, please reach out to your People Business Partner—we’re invested in the growth of all Sprout employees and want to ensure you’re receiving regular feedback and coaching across the annual review, quarterly check-ins, and regular 1:1s.\n\nThanks again for taking the time to share your thoughts. I hope you’ll share this feedback with your manager or People Business Partner, so we have the chance to improve your experience at Sprout. I really do want you to see Sprout as a place where you can continue to grow your career.",

          "advice": "Clarify and Respect Roles: Ensure that each team member's role and responsibilities are clearly defined and respected. Avoid overloading the security team with tasks that fall outside their primary function. This will help maintain focus and improve efficiency.\n\nValue Operational Work: Recognize and reward the importance of day-to-day operational tasks in maintaining a secure environment. Balanced acknowledgment of both project and operational contributions can lead to a more motivated and satisfied team.\n\nImplement a Feasible Deadline Approach: Re-evaluate the approach to setting project deadlines to ensure they are realistic and achievable. This will not only improve work quality but also reduce undue stress and burnout among team members.\n\nRevise Compensation Strategies Company Wide: Consider reviewing and restructuring the compensation and benefits package company wide. Sprout can be an enjoyable place to work, but that is not a replacement for competitive pay. Whatever sources you're using to determine competitive pay are very inaccurate. Competitive salaries and meaningful raises are crucial in retaining talent and showing appreciation for your employees' hard work and dedication.\n\nFoster Open Communication: Encourage a culture where feedback from all levels is genuinely considered and acted upon. This will not only empower your employees but also provide valuable insights for better decision-making at the management level.\n\nPromote Career Development: Offer more opportunities for professional growth and development. This includes providing clear pathways for advancement, as well as opportunities for training and upskilling.",
          "adviceOriginal": null,
          "cons": "Cons:\n\n- Directionless Security Leadership: The leadership within the security team lacks clear direction and often relies heavily on individual contributors to drive change. However, paradoxically, these contributions and suggestions are frequently overruled or ignored, creating a frustrating cycle of expectation without empowerment.\n\n - Unrealistic Deadlines: Projects within the security team are often saddled with impractical timelines. This leads to increased pressure and missed deadlines, without any ownership from leadership over their own role in this.\n\n - Undervaluation of Operational Work: Day-to-day operational tasks are consistently undervalued, with an excessive focus on project work. This approach overlooks the importance of maintaining and improving regular security operations.\n\n - Inexperienced Leadership: The security leadership team lacks significant experience outside of Sprout Social. This sometimes contributes to a narrow perspective on how a typical security team should function, hindering the team's effectiveness and growth.\n\n - Role Confusion: Leadership often volunteers the security team for non-security related tasks, leading to role confusion and a dilution of the team's primary focus. There is a bizarre sense of what provides value and what doesn't, and actual security seems to be at the bottom of the list of what provides value.\n\n - Misaligned Roles: A noticeable portion of the security team functions more as system administrators rather than as dedicated security engineers, which could impact the overall security posture.\n\n - Compensation Concerns: The salary structure is disappointing. Pay increases, including those for promotions, are minimal and fail to match inflation rates, let alone provide a sense of real financial progression. This approach does not demonstrate a commitment to retaining talent.\n\n - Average Benefits: The benefits package is average, lacking standout features that might compensate for other shortcomings in the compensation and work environment.",

While I understand the need for adjustments, it's disheartening to see the lack of corresponding measures for employees. The absence of cost of living increases, bonuses, or annual raises has left many of us grappling with financial challenges. It's especially frustrating when juxtaposed with the fact that the C-suite receives annual raises. This raises the question: When will the company demonstrate, through tangible actions and financial considerations, that they genuinely prioritize the well-being of all employees? The company proudly claims to be \"people first,\" but the reality seems to lean more towards a \"C-suite leadership first\" approach. For a truly people-centric organization, it's essential that actions align with words. Addressing inflation on the employee's end, providing fair and timely increases, and ensuring that everyone feels the positive impact of the company's success would go a long way in fostering a culture of trust and support.",

Upper management promotes empathy, but only empathy for them, which is odd. My experience was that they did not care about the employee experience, just the experience of a few people. They do not have their thump on what is going on inside their own company. There are some really bad people here in senior management. You should steer clear of working here.",

There's so much that desperately makes me want to stay at Sprout but I can no longer tolerate how I'm being treated by my coworkers, the increasing red tape, and the low pay.

People are extremely entitled and more and more enabled to behave like corporate bullies. Even people I once considered friends are showing me sides of themselves that shock me. This probably is due to the fact that our leadership team feels very absent, so to make up for it, people really are trying to prove their place and pave the way for their own success, or they're so stressed they're taking it out on others. It's become a \"what's in it for me\" culture. The things that drew me to the company years ago are gone. I understand change is inevitable and I support change in general, but these issues are cracks in our very DNA, not just a byproduct of being a larger and more international team moving at quick speeds. There's no accountability and now it feels often like we're running in circles.\n\nPay is also extremely low. When I talk to peers outside Sprout, but in the exact same role, they're all getting at least 30% higher base pay, have better benefits, and earn cash bonuses. Leadership has been challenged on staying competitive with compensation again and again, and look the other way. RSUs that vest in a few years are not enough in this economy, especially when stock prices aren't guaranteed and are influenced by outside factors we have no control over. My bills continue to increase but I won't ever get a penny more in salary until I'm promoted, and even then it'll be a small bump. Overall, the company feels really cheap and like it's a pain to spend any money for needs the team has.",

Not only that, promotions and raises do not come easily even if you consistently exceed goals and metrics. It also felt like feedback fell on deaf ears, and whenever feedback was submitted, it didn't matter at all. My biggest feedback is that Support feels like the red-headed stepchild of the company. There's always this pressure to meet metrics and when you mention you feel burnt out, they tell you to have a \"growth mindset\". Whenever there are company events or R&amp;R days, you can't actually take advantage of that because someone has to be scheduled to work to meet these impossible goals/metrics. You're expected to be a team player and say yes to increasing tasks or schedule changes, even if your workload is heavy. This adds onto more pressure and if you try to set boundaries (like they encourage), you're given negative feedback. After some turnover of more tenured employees (which is telling), it felt like nothing was done to boost team morale and we were still held to an impossibly high standard. All in all, Sprout is probably a great company to work for but the Support team is not.",

Ultimately, it mirrors the typical experience at any other company I've worked for. Advancement hinges on the favor of a select few individuals whose opinions carry weight; regardless of your achievements, if they harbor reservations or prefer someone else, progress stalls. Often, these decision-makers are detached from your day-to-day reality. Consequently, your manager's feedback and peer evaluations hold little sway. The final decisions are conveyed with vague and subjective feedback, often at odds with the content of previous one-on-one discussions throughout the year.\n\n- pay directly linked to career progress -\nIf your career stalls, so does your salary. Coupled with prevalent favoritism, this dynamic means your earnings may not keep pace with inflation unless you cater to the whims of the influential few.\n\n- fragile egos -\nMany individuals in crucial decision-making roles have tenure rather than merit as the basis of their positions. Among them, there exists a prevalence of delicate egos, potentially stemming from imposter syndrome. Correcting or disagreeing with them—even failing to express sufficient enthusiasm for their ideas—can easily cause offense. In such instances, it's often best to seek opportunities elsewhere, as your career prospects within the organization may become limited.\n\nThese dynamics cast Sprouts' values in a dubious light, revealing them as mere illusions. When the facade of objectivity fades, morale inevitably declines. Consequently, employees tend to disengage, merely going through the motions, or they decide to leave the organization altogether.",

However, there's lots of ambiguity, a lack of team and individual coaching, extreme pressure to hit metrics, and monthly quotas, and 1 bad quarter will put you on a performance plan, with no remorse or consideration of previous success. Unfortunately, managers are not experienced in cold calling, and sales teams' morale is extremely low. Sprout sales teams' compensation is relatively low and since most are not hitting quota anymore, the base compensation is not as competitive either.",

It also felt like feedback fell on deaf ears, and whenever feedback was submitted, it didn't matter at all. My biggest feedback is that Support feels like the red-headed stepchild of the company. There's always this pressure to meet metrics and when you mention you feel burnt out, they tell you to have a \"growth mindset\". Whenever there are company events or R&amp;R days, you can't actually take advantage of that because someone has to be scheduled to work to meet these impossible goals/metrics. You're expected to be a team player and say yes to increasing tasks or schedule changes, even if your workload is heavy. This adds onto more pressure and if you try to set boundaries (like they encourage), you're given negative feedback. After some turnover of more tenured employees (which is telling), it felt like nothing was done to boost team morale and we were still held to an impossibly high standard.

Sprout has traditionally been unique because of the incredible inbound funnel for sales teams. Inbound has dried up and all teams are expected to outbound, which is normal across the market. However, there's lots of ambiguity, a lack of team and individual coaching, extreme pressure to hit metrics, and monthly quotas, and 1 bad quarter will put you on a performance plan, with no remorse or consideration of previous success. Unfortunately, managers are not experienced in cold calling, and sales teams' morale is extremely low. Sprout sales teams' compensation is relatively low and since most are not hitting quota anymore, the base compensation is not as competitive either.",

There's been so much growth in the past few years, that lots of people have had opportunities to advance their careers. Executive leadership has always been communicative, and it tends to trickle down to first-line leaders as well. Sprout's full of really genuine, supportive, ambitious, very talented people, and it's clear that the company is intentional with hiring.",

        "cons": "Leadership has implemented a 3.75% increase to our healthcare contributions, citing the rising cost of healthcare. While I understand the need for adjustments, it's disheartening to see the lack of corresponding measures for employees. The absence of cost of living increases, bonuses, or annual raises has left many of us grappling with financial challenges. It's especially frustrating when juxtaposed with the fact that the C-suite receives annual raises. This raises the question: When will the company demonstrate, through tangible actions and financial considerations, that they genuinely prioritize the well-being of all employees? The company proudly claims to be \"people first,\" but the reality seems to lean more towards a \"C-suite leadership first\" approach. For a truly people-centric organization, it's essential that actions align with words. Addressing inflation on the employee's end, providing fair and timely increases, and ensuring that everyone feels the positive impact of the company's success would go a long way in fostering a culture of trust and support.",

Balanced acknowledgment of both project and operational contributions can lead to a more motivated and satisfied team.\n\nImplement a Feasible Deadline Approach: Re-evaluate the approach to setting project deadlines to ensure they are realistic and achievable. This will not only improve work quality but also reduce undue stress and burnout among team members.\n\nRevise Compensation Strategies Company Wide: Consider reviewing and restructuring the compensation and benefits package company wide. Sprout can be an enjoyable place to work, but that is not a replacement for competitive pay. Whatever sources you're using to determine competitive pay are very inaccurate. Competitive salaries and meaningful raises are crucial in retaining talent and showing appreciation for your employees' hard work and dedication.\n\nFoster Open Communication: Encourage a culture where feedback from all levels is genuinely considered and acted upon.

This leads to increased pressure and missed deadlines, without any ownership from leadership over their own role in this.\n\n - Undervaluation of Operational Work: Day-to-day operational tasks are consistently undervalued, with an excessive focus on project work. This approach overlooks the importance of maintaining and improving regular security operations.\n\n - Inexperienced Leadership: The security leadership team lacks significant experience outside of Sprout Social. This sometimes contributes to a narrow perspective on how a typical security team should function, hindering the team's effectiveness and growth.\n\n - Role Confusion: Leadership often volunteers the security team for non-security related tasks, leading to role confusion and a dilution of the team's primary focus. There is a bizarre sense of what provides value and what doesn't, and actual security seems to be at the bottom of the list of what provides value.\n\n - Misaligned Roles: A noticeable portion of the security team functions more as system administrators rather than as dedicated security engineers, which could impact the overall security posture.\n\n - Compensation Concerns: The salary structure is disappointing. Pay increases, including those for promotions, are minimal and fail to match inflation rates, let alone provide a sense of real financial progression. This approach does not demonstrate a commitment to retaining talent.\n\n - Average Benefits: The benefits package is average, lacking standout features that might compensate for other shortcomings in the compensation and work environment.",

People are extremely entitled and more and more enabled to behave like corporate bullies. Even people I once considered friends are showing me sides of themselves that shock me. This probably is due to the fact that our leadership team feels very absent, so to make up for it, people really are trying to prove their place and pave the way for their own success, or they're so stressed they're taking it out on others. It's become a \"what's in it for me\" culture. The things that drew me to the company years ago are gone. I understand change is inevitable and I support change in general, but these issues are cracks in our very DNA, not just a byproduct of being a larger and more international team moving at quick speeds. There's no accountability and now it feels often like we're running in circles.\n\nPay is also extremely low. When I talk to peers outside Sprout, but in the exact same role, they're all getting at least 30% higher base pay, have better benefits, and earn cash bonuses. Leadership has been challenged on staying competitive with compensation again and again, and look the other way. RSUs that vest in a few years are not enough in this economy, especially when stock prices aren't guaranteed and are influenced by outside factors we have no control over. My bills continue to increase but I won't ever get a penny more in salary until I'm promoted, and even then it'll be a small bump.

        "advice": "Sprout holds potential as an excellent workplace. With the influx of new voices from outside and their placement in leadership roles, there's a growing acknowledgment of the flaws in the performance review system. However, a significant hurdle remains: these leaders lack the autonomy to make independent decisions. Instead, they must persuade uninformed yet supposedly pivotal decision-makers. It's time to abandon this excessive micromanagement and entrust the frontline leaders with the authority to determine who merits advancement and who does not.",
        "cons": "rank favoritism\nCareer progress documentation is abundant, but reviews are protracted affairs involving numerous meetings. Ultimately, it mirrors the typical experience at any other company I've worked for. Advancement hinges on the favor of a select few individuals whose opinions carry weight; regardless of your achievements, if they harbor reservations or prefer someone else, progress stalls. Often, these decision-makers are detached from your day-to-day reality. Consequently, your manager's feedback and peer evaluations hold little sway. The final decisions are conveyed with vague and subjective feedback, often at odds with the content of previous one-on-one discussions throughout the year.\n\n- pay directly linked to career progress -\nIf your career stalls, so does your salary. Coupled with prevalent favoritism, this dynamic means your earnings may not keep pace with inflation unless you cater to the whims of the influential few.\n\n- fragile egos -\nMany individuals in crucial decision-making roles have tenure rather than merit as the basis of their positions. Among them, there exists a prevalence of delicate egos, potentially stemming from imposter syndrome. Correcting or disagreeing with them—even failing to express sufficient enthusiasm for their ideas—can easily cause offense. In such instances, it's often best to seek opportunities elsewhere, as your career prospects within the organization may become limited.\n\nThese dynamics cast Sprouts' values in a dubious light, revealing them as mere illusions. When the facade of objectivity fades, morale inevitably declines. Consequently, employees tend to disengage, merely going through the motions, or they decide to leave the organization altogether.",

      "# [The 2024 Social Media Content Strategy Report on 2024-09-09](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/data/2024-social-content-strategy-report/)\nSocial media users have an insatiable appetite for content—even as the social ecosystem becomes more complex. Despite AI-generated content inundating feeds, emerging networks shaking up the landscape and algorithms transforming on a dime, consumers have never been more plugged in and eager to engage with their favorite brands on every channel.\n\nFor marketers, this is a call to action that’s getting harder to answer. Without the right insights and direction, social teams face creative fatigue trying to keep up with their audience’s heightened demands. We surveyed over 4,500 consumers to find out what users actually want from brands on social, and how their responses differ from network to network. These findings reveal what kind of content social teams with limited budgets and bandwidth should prioritize, and how to deliver the greatest return on investment from your social media efforts.",

A tactic that works today may no longer be as relevant a year down the line. This makes it crucial for marketers to stay up to date with the latest data points and statistics involving social media. To start with, you’ll need the latest social media demographics to update your strategy for 2024.\n\nWith more networks available than ever before, you need to spend your time and budget wisely.

It reveals where your target audience is and, in the process, which platforms are best for conducting market research.\n\nWant to know which apps are up-and-coming? Curious about new opportunities to cross-post your content? Worried that a network might be “dying?”\n\nWe’ve got you covered.\n\nBelow, we give you a platform-wise breakdown of must-know social media demographics for 2024 (and beyond). These numbers come from the latest research and social media statistics available at the time of writing. They highlight the facts about social media that could inform how you approach each platform.\n\nAnd as a bonus, we’ve also highlighted strategic takeaways for each network to guide your social marketing strategy.\n\nBefore we get started, here’s a quick summary of a few key insights.\n\nWhat is the most used social media platform?\n\nFacebook continues to be the most used social media platform.\n\nWhat is the most used social media by age?\n\nBelow is a breakdown of social media usage by age range:\n\n18-29 years – Snapchat (41%), TikTok (35%), Instagram (32%)\n\n30-39 years – LinkedIn (34%), X/Twitter (34%), Snapchat (33%), Instagram (32%)\n\n40-49 years – LinkedIn (25%), Facebook (22%), X/Twitter (21%)\n\n50-59 years – Facebook (29%), LinkedIn (24%), Pinterest (24%)\n\nSource: Statistia\n\nWhat age range is the most active demographic on social media?\n\nMillennials are the most active demographic on social media, with 68.8% of them estimated using social in 2024. In terms of daily time spent on social media, Gen Z tops the list with 35% using it more than two hours a day.\n\nSource: McKinsey\n\nWhat social media does Gen Z use the most?\n\nYouTube is the most used social media among Gen Z.\n\nFacebook demographics and usage\n\nNumber of monthly active users: 3.065 billion\n\nLargest age group: 25-34 (29.9%)\n\nGender distribution: 43.7% female, 56.3% male (no data on other genders)\n\nTime spent per day: 30.9 minutes\n\nTakeaways from Facebook demographics for 2024\n\nFacebook remains the most popular social media platform among consumers and marketers. For the first time, it hit the 3 billion monthly active users, making it the first social media platform to do so.\n\nTime spent on Facebook sees a slight increase from the previous year’s 30 minutes per day. However, a 9-second increase isn’t enough to suggest that people are spending significantly more time on Facebook daily.\n\nSimilar to the previous years, younger users continue to flock to TikTok and Snapchat. The platform’s usage among 13-17-year-olds stands at a sordid 4.8%, suggesting that it’s not the best place to target a younger audience.\n\nSource: Statista\n\nLearn more about other vital Facebook statistics to prepare your 2024 strategy.\n\nInstagram demographics and usage\n\nNumber of monthly active users: 2 billion\n\nLargest age group: 18-24 (30.8%)\n\nGender distribution: 48.2% female, 51.8% male (no data on other genders)\n\nTime spent per day: 33.1 minutes\n\nTakeaways from Instagram demographics for 2024\n\nThe platform’s growth remains steady in spite of a slowdown in recent years.\n\nAs far as social media age demographics go, Instagram maintains a firm hold on both Gen Z and millennials. These groups make up roughly two-thirds of their base.\n\nTime spent on the platform increased from the previous year’s 30.1 minutes. A 2-minute increase indicates that people are spending more time engaging with Instagram content.\n\nLearn more about other vital Instagram statistics to prepare your 2024 strategy.\n\nTikTok demographics and usage\n\nNumber of monthly active users: 1.7 billion\n\nLargest age group: 18-24 (36.2%)\n\nGender distribution: 49.2% female, 50.8% male (no data on other genders)\n\nTime spent per day: 53.8 minutes\n\nTakeaways from TikTok demographics for 2024\n\nTikTok hasn’t surpassed Facebook and Instagram in number of monthly active users. But its growing popularity and increased usage could soon change that.\n\nGen Z is driving this growth in popularity, with 78% of US Gen Z using it in 2023.\n\nNot only is TikTok’s user base booming but also its daily activity. TikTok boasts the highest average time spent per day of any network. Daily time spent on the platform grew by almost 10 minutes compared to the previous year’s 45.8 minutes.\n\nSource: Insider Intelligence\n\nThe fact that the platform’s gender demographics are leveling out is also notable. In fact, there are now more male users than female, but only with a slight difference. Last year, the split was 54% female and 46% male. This signals TikTok’s status as a staple social app among the population at large.\n\nLearn more about other vital TikTok statistics to prepare your 2024 strategy.\n\nX (formerly Twitter) demographics and usage\n\nNumber of monthly active users: 368 million\n\nLargest age group: 25-34 (38.5%)\n\nGender distribution: 37% female, 63% male (no data on other genders)\n\nTime spent per day: 34.1 minutes\n\nTakeaways from X demographics for 2024\n\nAfter rebranding to X, the platform saw a 13% decline in daily active users during the first year.\n\nSome reports note a spike in activity while others note a migration away from the app. eMarketer predicts that X’s user base will drop to 335.7 million in 2024.\n\nIn spite of this, people are still spending much more time on X than on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nThere’s a slight increase in the number of female users (from the previous year’s 34.1%). That said, X is still one of those platforms with an overwhelmingly large male user base.\n\nLearn more about other vital Twitter statistics to prepare your 2024 strategy.\n\nYouTube demographics and usage\n\nNumber of monthly active users: 2.491 billion\n\nLargest age group: 25-34 (21.2%)\n\nGender distribution: 45.6% female, 54.4% male (no data on other genders)\n\nTime spent per day: 48.7 minutes\n\nTakeaways from YouTube demographics for 2024\n\nYouTube’s popularity has grown among Gen Z users, particularly in the United States. It’s now the most frequented online platform among U.S. Gen Z adults.\n\nGender distribution on the platform started to level out in the previous year with 51.4% female and 48.6% male users. This has completely flipped in 2024. Now there are more male users than female users on the platform.\n\nPeople are also spending over 3 minutes more on the platform per day, highlighting the growing adoption of video content.\n\nStill, most users claim to use YouTube for entertainment rather than to find brands and products.

So far, the only actions we have taken is ignoring for Facebook and reporting as spam for Twitter via Sprout.\n\n@reid.zura Ugh, this seems to be happening to so many of us!\n\nFor Facebook: I learned a lifechanging tip yesterday from someone in the #HigherEdSocial community on Facebook. I’ll try to reiterate here, but I just asked the OP if I can share the video they created. They did a great step-by-step tutorial on this.\n\nSo, there’s a way to automate your Meta inbox and create a rule to exclude certain keywords coming in:\n\nGo to inbox\n\nClick on “Automations” - it’s the second button from the left at the top of the interface (screenshot below)\n\nClick “Create Automation” in the upper right corner\n\nClick “Start from scratch” to create a new automation\n\nName your rule\n\nUnder “When this happens,” select “New message received” to start automation\n\nClick “Add condition” and select “Keywords”\n\nInput some of the main keywords in your recurring messages\n\nUnder “Take this action,” select “Mark as” and “Move to spam”\n\nSave changes\n\nHope this helps! It has already saved me time this morning. (Thanks OP, if you’re reading this!!)\n\nFor X: Our team sunset our X account back in August, but I still monitor for brand conversations and see these spam posts pop up from time to time. I tend to ignore or report, but it is annoying. Maybe X has a way to automate as well? I’m not sure, but hopefully someone here can help.\n\nBest of luck!\n\nI’m having the same issue, I’m so glad that someone posted this!\n\nThank you @michaelajo20 ! That is so helpful!\n\n@michelle.reddick Of course! I couldn’t believe I had been living this long without Meta inbox automations, haha!\n\nHi! Here Flor from Argentina. We experienced in private messages (in Facebook) a lot of people making random questions about the brand, but when we answer, most of them say that they never sent the message. They ask questions like, can you tell me more about the business? Anyone experienced this?\n\nThank you!\n\nThe other place on Facebook I’ve started seeing these spam messages are bots leaving Recommendations/Reviews - which of course aren’t as easily removed as a tag or regular post.\n\n@Laura Porcincula is there a way to do a similar automation in Smart Inbox? To filter incoming messages to be marked as complete and labeled as spam?\n\n@reid.zura Ugh, this seems to be happening to so many of us!\n\nFor Facebook: I learned a lifechanging tip yesterday from someone in the #HigherEdSocial community on Facebook.

Has anybody else?\n\nGreat question @mary, advanced plan users can set up rules to hide the message on the native platforms. I shared the steps for those rules in this Sprout customer only thread if you need some more info.\n\nI knew this couldn’t just be happening to the accounts I manage! So glad to see that others are just as frustrated. (Not glad that we’re frustrated, just glad that I’m not alone.)\n\nIn one of the newsletters I got this morning, I found this solution. I promise that’s a link to a real blog and not a spam link Crossing my fingers it helps this weekend!\n\nHi @lisa.roughley - we also have now had these spam comments coming in as reviews! I have not found a fix for it but if I do I’ll post here. Please share with me if you find it first!\n\nCheers,\n\nStacy\n\nFor a number of our clients, we have turned off reviews for now. I’m guessing FB is working on this issue because we’ve noticed a huge drop in reviews overall and in, investigating, found that review access via mobile is cumbersome. That’s, at least what we’re guessing has created the big drop in real reviews.\n\n@reid.zura Ugh, this seems to be happening to so many of us!\n\nFor Facebook: I learned a lifechanging tip yesterday from someone in the #HigherEdSocial community on Facebook.

      "# [Best times to post on social media in 2024 by Mary Keutelian on 2024-04-10](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/best-times-to-post-on-social-media/)\nBest Times to Post on Social Media\n\nAccording to Sprout Social's analysis of nearly 2 billion engagements across 400,000 social profiles including Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest and TikTok, the best times to post on social media are:\n\nMondays from 11 a.m. to noon\n\nTuesdays from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 3 to 4 p.m.\n\nWednesdays from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.\n\nThursdays from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.\n\nFridays from 10 to 11 a.m.\n\nBest days to post on social media: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays\n\nWorst days to post on social media: Sundays\n\nEach social channel has its benefits depending on your goals, campaigns, content type and target audience. If you’re seeking to uncover changes to and improve your engagement, revisit your social media KPIs. Does your current social strategy align with meeting those KPIs? Of course, if increasing likes and comments are some of your KPIs, knowing which days get the most engagement helps you reach those goals as well.\n\nWhile interpreting the data for each social network individually, we consistently notice that the highest times of engagement are Tuesdays through Thursdays generally between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. Midweek mornings prove to be a successful time across most social platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and LinkedIn. Pinterest and TikTok see higher engagement in the afternoons.\n\nThere’s more to posting on social media than this quick stat, though. Each network sees varying ranges of engagement throughout the week and at remarkably different times. And when you isolate industries on each network, engagement varies even more. So even though Tuesdays through Thursdays between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. are generally the best times to post on social, consider other variables before you schedule any posts.\n\nBest time to post on social media in the UK\n\nOverall, the best times to post on social media in the UK are Tuesday and Thursday between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. Weekday mornings are a great time to post across many of the most popular social platforms in the UK including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and LinkedIn. If you target UK users of Tiktok or Pinterest, afternoon posts receive higher engagement. It is important to remember this data is collated and industry, content and goals will also play a role in the right time to post for your business but this is a useful starting point.\n\nBest Times to Post on Facebook\n\nMondays from 9 a.m. to noon\n\nTuesdays from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 5 p.m.\n\nWednesdays from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 5 p.m.\n\nThursdays from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 5 p.m.\n\nFridays from 9 to 11 a.m.\n\nBest days to post on Facebook: Mondays through Thursdays\n\nWorst days to post on Facebook: Sundays\n\nIt’s true: Facebook is still the most used platform by marketers worldwide at 89%, and by monthly active users at 3.05 billion (yes, billion). The impact Facebook has on our social media use as consumers and marketers is still ever present. Compared to last year, high engagement periods on Facebook are still within mid-mornings during weekdays and matching general business hours.\n\nOptimal send times for Facebook are Mondays through Fridays starting mostly at 9 a.m. until early afternoon, generally 2 p.m. What does this mean for marketers? Most users are taking a quick break in their routines for Facebook, making it the best time to schedule posts for target audiences to interact with.\n\nWith a solid Facebook marketing strategy, businesses connect with the right audiences with their content, whether it’s keeping audiences informed of products or sharing access to exclusive deals. Remember, engagement is a combination of how often you post on social media and what content types you post.\n\nBest Times to Post on Instagram\n\nMondays from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.\n\nTuesdays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n\nWednesdays from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n\nThursdays from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.\n\nFridays at 11 a.m.\n\nBest days to post on Instagram: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays\n\nWorst days to post on Instagram: Sundays\n\nWhere Facebook was the most-used platform by marketers worldwide, Instagram comes in second at 80%. Interestingly, Instagram ties with Facebook for the social media platforms that offer marketers the highest ROI at 29%. This is because social media continues to evolve with ecommerce and offering frictionless experiences to users. And even though the competition for short-form video between Instagram and TikTok continues to heat up, Reels still generate more likes and saves than static Instagram posts.\n\nThe best times to post on Instagram are weekdays generally between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., with Tuesdays and Wednesdays engagement times extending to 4 p.m. We recommend scheduling posts Tuesdays through Thursdays between 10 and and 3 p.m. for optimal engagement. It’s wise to test these benchmarks against your current metrics too.\n\nInstagram has grown a long way since its photo-only days. The app, which has 2 billion monthly active users, is a platform to share images, videos, Reels and live streams, just to name a few creative content types. It is also an avenue to collaborate and partner with other brands and provides a stream of revenue through its ecommerce capabilities.\n\nThe Instagram algorithm is unpredictable. To be successful on the platform is a balance of consistently posting high-quality content that will engage and entertain your audiences. That’s a lot to ask for with each piece of content published. But using that as a guiding post can help with your Instagram marketing strategy.\n\nBest Times to Post on LinkedIn\n\nBest times to post on LinkedIn Company Pages:\n\nTuesdays and Wednesdays from 10 a.m. to noon\n\nThursdays at 10 a.m.\n\nBest days to post on LinkedIn Company Pages: Tuesdays through Thursdays\n\nWorst days to post on LinkedIn Company Pages: Weekends\n\nUnsurprising for this professional-focused social platform, LinkedIn engagement times are consistent with general business hours. High engagement hours are more concentrated midday and don’t extend too far out past the workday hours. Businesses are less likely to get eyes on their LinkedIn marketing efforts on the weekend when engagement and usage drops.\n\nBecause LinkedIn content is centered around professional thought-leadership and career growth, it makes sense that a majority of audiences engage with this content throughout their working day. By midday, there’s buzz on the platform, and the best times to post on LinkedIn are Tuesdays and Wednesdays between 10 a.m. and noon and Thursdays at 10 a.m..\n\nYes, LinkedIn is a business and employment-focused platform, but it’s more than a job board and networking platform. LinkedIn provides a platform for professional storytelling and advocacy, from both employees and employers alike. Contributors of all levels can share their subject-matter expertise, create conversations that challenge business-as-usual, and uplift professional voices around the world.\n\nWith over 1 billion members in 200 countries and regions, LinkedIn is important for a wide range of business opportunities. Businesses on LinkedIn are finding new ways to generate leads, find co-marketing partners, highlight company culture and attract talent. Because of these additional business opportunities LinkedIn provides, it makes sense that posting and engagement match with the business hours.\n\nBest Times to Post on Pinterest\n\nTuesdays through Fridays at 1 a.m.\n\nThursdays at 3 a.m.\n\nBest days to post on Pinterest: Weekdays\n\nWorst days to post on Pinterest: Weekends\n\nWhile people may associate Pinterest as the visual search engine where users go to research and discover DIY projects and inspiration products, it also presents an opportunity to expand your community and brand awareness. While not all brands may be on the platform, those who use it know more of Pinterest’s benefits.\n\nThis is the second year we’re providing the best times to post on Pinterest. We’re seeing a significant shift in engagement hours this year compared to last. Whereas last year we saw a nearly universal spread across all hours of the day every day of the week, this year we’re seeing significant engagement at the early hours of the morning and lower moderate engagement midday during weekdays. Interestingly, Tuesdays through Fridays at 1 a.m. and Thursdays at 3 a.m. are peak time to post on Pinterest.\n\nIt may be a combination of when users are struck with inspiration and the Pinterest algorithm that affects engagement times, but that shouldn’t stop you from creating a social media calendar with posts scheduled at those hours.\n\nBest Times to Post on TikTok\n\nTuesdays from 4 to 6 p.m.\n\nWednesdays from 9 to 11 a.m., noon, and 2 to 6 p.m.\n\nThursdays from 9 to 11 a.m. and 2 to 6 p.m.\n\nFridays from 4 to 6 p.m.\n\nBest days to post on TikTok: Wednesdays and Thursdays\n\nWorst days to post on TikTok: Sundays\n\nAs the youngest digital platform on this list, TikTok has grown significantly and made waves in half as many years as the others on this list. With the app now amassing over 1.5 billion active global users who spend an average of 23 hours on the app every month, TikTok has competitive power against other platforms.\n\nThe best times to post on TikTok are Tuesdays and Fridays from 4 to 6 p.m., Wednesdays, Thursdays mornings from 9 to 11 a.m. and Thursdays from 2 to 6 p.m. Afternoons are when the highest engagements are on the platform; users are looking to fill their afternoon entertainment boost. However, generally, mid-morning through the afternoon (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.) on Tuesdays through Fridays see above average engagement on the app.\n\nWith TikTok trends changing quickly, it’s important to understand how trends start, evolve and influence. Once you understand how these forces, moments or signals work, you can create a better TikTok trend strategy to implement rather than participating reactively.\n\nBest Times to Post on X (FKA Twitter)\n\nMondays from 10 a.m. to noon\n\nTuesdays from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.\n\nWednesdays from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.\n\nThursdays from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.\n\nFridays 10 a.m. to noon\n\nBest days to post on X (Twitter): Tuesdays through Thursdays\n\nWorst days to post on X (Twitter): Sundays\n\nX (formerly known as Twitter) has consistently been the platform for up-to-the-minute conversations and breaking news. And that didn’t stop X from being part of the news itself on the network last year. Businesses and brands continuously look to X to participate in trending topics that align with their brand values in the process. However, due to global conflicts and vocal executives, some brands have limited their social strategies around X.\n\nDespite all this, X peak times for engagement extended slightly compared to last year, with hours extending further into the weekday afternoons. The best times to post on Twitter are Mondays through Fridays beginning at 9 a.m. and extending until nearly 3 p.m..\n\nThis extension of engagement on X could reflect an interest in developing news and updates as the day unfolds, as well as a desire for entertainment. There were also d several global events that kept users engaged on the app last year. Brands also use X as part of their customer service strategy, as an alternative to traditional customer support options.\n\nHow to find your own best times to post on social media\n\nSocial marketers can plan content more effectively when they’re armed with data. And as platforms evolve, how brands and consumers use social will evolve with them, or vice versa. Staying aware of new content formats and trends might help you reach your audience in unexpected ways, or even find new segments and personas you weren’t focusing on before.\n\nWhile you may be ready to jump in and post at these provided peak engagement times as part of your strategy, consider pairing this data with your own social media data analysis. You may discover that your specific target audience is active near the peak times we’ve outlined or hours earlier.\n\nA social media management tool like Sprout Social can help you drill into your analytics and develop tailored findings for your brand accounts across all networks, holistically and individually. Gain competitive insights by comparing your performance to your competitors, to find new opportunities for engagement.\n\nWith features like post tagging and cross-network reporting, you can separate different factors like post author or types of content, and drill down into how your posting time influenced your social success.\n\nSprout’s patented ViralPost® technology uses the same data we’ve used to look at all our customer accounts to determine the best time to post tailored for your account.

Once your account is provisioned, you must do one of the following to authenticate API requests:\n\nCreate an account-scoped access token\n\n(New) Create an OAuth access token using our OAuth 2.0 provider\n\nCreating an Account-Scoped Access Token\n\nAn account's owner can create new account-scoped access tokens via the API Tokens settings page. They can also view or invalidate existing tokens (i.e. prevent the tokens from being used for client requests).\n\nLog in to Sprout and navigate to the API Tokens settings page.\n\nAccept Sprout’s Analytics API Terms of Service if you haven’t already.\n\nClick Create API Token in the upper right corner of the Token Management section.\n\nEnter a name for your token.\n\nCopy the token for use. Be sure to store this securely.\n\nCreating an OAuth Access Token Using our OAuth 2.0 Provider\n\nSprout's OAuth provider follows OpenId Connect (OIDC) and OAuth 2.0 industry standard specifications to federate identity & authentication and grant short-lived user credentials (i.e. OAuth access tokens) that can be used to access the API.\n\nObtaining a Client ID and Secret\n\nTo interact with Sprout's OAuth provider, you must obtain a Client ID and Secret using the API Tokens settings page. An account's owner can create or manage a client via the API Tokens settings page.\n\nLog in to Sprout and navigate to the API Tokens settings page.\n\nAccept Sprout’s Analytics API Terms of Service if you haven’t already.\n\nClick Generate configuration in the upper right corner of the OAuth Client Management section.\n\nEnter a name for your client, a description, and a list of allowed redirect URIs.\n\nCopy the Client ID and Secret for use. Be sure to store these securely.\n\nObtaining an OAuth Access Token\n\nNow that you have a Client ID and Secret, you can use the Sprout OAuth provider to obtain an OAuth access token, which you will use to interact with the API.\n\nYour client is setup to use the Authorization Code Grant flow to obtain access tokens. You may use the OAuth/OIDC specifications to learn how to do this.\n\nX Data: X Content End User License Agreement\n\nNote: X has additional review and compliance requirements around exposing data through the API. You’re required to undergo a brief review and approval process before you can access X's data through the Sprout API.\n\nContact your Sprout Social account representative to initiate the review process with X. After X approves your use case, the Account Owner needs to accept the Analytics API X Content End User License Agreement. This appears at the top of the API Tokens settings page.\n\nSprout API Details\n\nAPI URL\n\nhttps://api.sproutsocial.com\n\nEndpoints Overview\n\nSprout API endpoints are grouped into three collections:\n\nCustomer Metadata Endpoints - Use these endpoints to obtain high-level information about your Sprout customer account and profiles you have access to; many of these endpoints provide data needed to make requests to other Sprout API endpoints.\n\nAnalytics Endpoints - These endpoints provide information about your Sprout profiles, and posts.\n\nListening Endpoints - These endpoints provide metrics and messages related to your Listening Topics.\n\nMessages Endpoint - This endpoint provides detailed data and metadata about your Sprout messages.\n\nPublishing Post Endpoints - These endpoints allow for creation and management of posts that will be published at a future time.\n\nMedia Endpoints - These endpoints are used to upload media for use within the API.\n\nCustomer Metadata Endpoints Description GET /v1/metadata/client Customer ID GET /v1/<customer ID>/metadata/customer Customer Profiles GET /v1/<customer ID>/metadata/customer/tags Customer Tags GET /v1/<customer ID>/metadata/customer/groups Customer Groups GET /v1/<customer ID>/metadata/customer/users Customer Users GET /v1/<customer ID>/metadata/customer/topics Customer Topics\n\nAnalytics Endpoints Description POST /v1/<customer ID>/analytics/profiles Owned Profile Analytics POST /v1/<customer ID>/analytics/posts Post Analytics\n\nListening Endpoints Description POST /v1/<customer ID>/listening/topics/<topic id>/messages Topic Messages POST /v1/<customer ID>/listening/topics/<topic id>/metrics Topic Metrics\n\nMessages Endpoint Description POST /v1/<customer ID>/messages Inbox Messages\n\nPublishing Post Endpoints Description POST /v1/<customer ID>/publishing/posts Create Publishing Post GET /v1/<customer ID>/publishing/posts/<publishing_post_id> Retrieve Publishing Post\n\nMedia Upload Endpoints Description POST /v1/<customer ID>/media/ Upload Media in a single request < 50MB POST /v1/<customer ID>/media/submission Start multipart media upload POST /v1/<customer ID>/media/submission/<submission_id>/part/<part_number> Continue multipart media upload GET /v1/<customer ID>/media/submission/<submission_id> Complete multipart media upload\n\nGeneral API Structure\n\nAll endpoints use the following naming structure:\n\n/<version>/<customer ID>/<endpoint path>\n\nWhere:\n\nversion is the API major version number\n\ncustomer ID is your Sprout customer ID\n\nVersioning\n\nThe Sprout API is versioned using a MAJOR.MINOR version format.\n\nYou can specify only the major number in requests, but the full version is included in responses.\n\nA major version represents a breaking change to the API, including updates to the syntax and semantics for making requests of the APIs and the syntax and semantics of the response of the API.\n\nA minor version represents a backwards compatible change to the API, such as adding new metrics, new endpoints, metric updates, etc. Minor versions are reflected in documentation, but not the API URL itself. Due to the backwards compatibility of minor versions, you only need to specify the major version in the URL path.\n\nRate Limits\n\nYou’re limited to the following number of requests:\n\n60 requests per minute\n\n250,000 requests per month\n\nEndpoints\n\nRequests\n\nAll requests have the following format:\n\nRequest Headers\n\nType Value Authorization Bearer <API access token> Accept application/json Content-Type application/json\n\nNote that the Authorization header accepts both account-scoped and OAuth access tokens.\n\nRequest Body\n\nThe content body for all requests are JSON objects. Details of the structure of that JSON object depend on the endpoint.\n\nResponses\n\nHTTP Status Codes\n\nThe following HTTP status codes returned with the response have the following meanings:\n\nCode Meaning Corrective Action 200 OK Request was processed successfully. None. You should be able to access the result of the request in the response body. 202 Ready Request was processed successfully but not ready for a proper answer. Retry the request.

[\"created_time:asc\"] timezone\n\n(optional) (Posts endpoint only)\n\nTime zone—from the ICANN time zone database. Timezone arguments only impact date/time-related filters, responses are not impacted and are always in UTC for posts. \"America/Chicago\" fields\n\n(optional) (Posts endpoint only)\n\nList of fields to return in results; if omitted, only the guid field is returned. Refer to the Message Fields section for full list of valid fields [\"content_category\", \"created_time\", \"from.name\"]\n\nResponses - Analytics Endpoints\n\nResponses follow the standard data API response format:\n\ndata\n\nThis array contains the analytics data requested. See specific endpoints for additional details.\n\npaging\n\nThis object specifies the state of paging for this response:\n\nKey Description Example Value current_page 1-indexed page number of the response 3 total_pages Total number of pages for the request 20\n\nA paging object is always returned, including when the response contains all data in one page. You can rely on checking for current_page = total_pages in order to know when you are at the end of the paging sequence.\n\nRequesting a page greater than total_pages will return a HTTP 400 Bad Request response with a message describing the error.\n\nLimitations\n\nNote the maximum response size is capped at 10,000 results. For example, if a request with 50 responses per page is made, you will get at most 200 total_pages back. Anything beyond this 10,000 limit will be truncated as a performance guardrail.\n\nTo request data for responses with more than 10,000 results, use a cursor-based pagination approach following these steps:\n\n1.) Prepare the API URL for the specific endpoint you want to retrieve data from.\n\n2.) Define the request body by specifying the necessary parameters like limit, timezone, filters, fields, and metrics criteria.\n\n3.) Set the appropriate headers, including any required authentication or session information.\n\n4.) Set the \"sort\" field to organize the response data by \"guid\" in ascending order\n\n5.) Send an initial request to the API endpoint to retrieve a batch of data, specifying a limit on the number of items to be returned per request (e.g. 100 items per request).\n\n6.) Process the sorted response data and extract the last \"guid\" value from the response. This \"guid\" will be used as the cursor for the next request.\n\n7.) Send a subsequent request to the API endpoint. We’ll filter for posts with a guid greater than the guid we saw in the previous step to fetch the next batch of data. This request should also specify the limit and any other necessary parameters. See below for an example request to see how this is done.\n\n8.) Repeat steps 2-7 until there are no more GUID's left in the response. Each time you receive a response, extract the last \"guid\" value, and use it to filter posts with greater guids for the following requests.\n\n9.) As you receive the paginated responses, you can store or process the data as needed.\n\nInitial Request:\n\n{ \"filters\": [ \"customer_profile_id.eq(123, 4567, 890)\" ], \"fields\": [ \"guid\" ], \"sort\": [ \"guid:asc\" ], \"limit\": 2 }\n\nInitial Response:\n\n{ \"data\": [ { \"guid\": \"101\" }, { \"guid\": \"102\" } ] }\n\nSubsequent Request:\n\n{ \"filters\": [ \"guid.gt(102)\", \"customer_profile_id.eq(123, 4567, 890)\" ], \"fields\": [ \"guid\" ], \"sort\": [ \"guid:asc\" ], \"limit\": 2 }\n\nNote that the last guid from the initial response (102) was used as a filter for the subsequent response ( \"guid.gt(102)\"). Each request thereafter should continue to filter on the last guid from the previous response until no more guids are returned.\n\nOwned Profile Analytics Endpoint\n\nPOST /v1/<customer ID>/analytics/profiles\n\nThe profiles endpoint is used to query profile-level metrics for a given set of profiles.\n\nRequest Body - Owned Profile Analytics Endpoint\n\nAn example request:\n\n{ \"filters\": [ \"customer_profile_id.eq(1234, 5678, 9012)\", \"reporting_period.in(2018-08-01...2018-10-01)\" ], \"metrics\": [ \"impressions\", \"reactions\" ], \"page\": 1 }\n\nResponse Data - Owned Profile Analytics Endpoint\n\nAn example response:\n\n{ \"data\" : [ { \"dimensions\": { \"reporting_period.by(day)\": \"2018-08-01\", \"customer_profile_id\": 1234 }, \"metrics\": { \"impressions\": 3400, \"reactions\": 12 } }, { \"dimensions\": { \"reporting_period.by(day)\": \"2018-08-01\", \"customer_profile_id\": 5678 }, \"metrics\": { \"impressions\": 23423, \"reactions\": 29 } }, ... ], \"paging\": { \"current_page\": 2, \"total_pages\": 3 } }\n\nProfile Request Limits & Pagination\n\ncustomer_profile_id (filters): maximum of 100 profiles per request\n\nreporting_period (filters): maximum of 1 year per request\n\nPagination of response: pagination is based on 1000 results per response\n\nProfile Time Zone\n\nProfile daily activity uses the time zone of the native network. These time zones are the same that are used by native networks when grouping profile level activity.\n\nNetwork Timezone X UTC Facebook PST/PDT Instagram PST/PDT LinkedIn UTC YouTube PST/PDT Pinterest UTC Tiktok UTC\n\nPost Analytics Endpoint\n\nPOST /v1/<customer ID>/analytics/posts\n\nThe posts content endpoint queries for individual sent posts based on a filter criteria.\n\nRequest Body - Post Analytics Endpoint\n\nAn example request:\n\n{ \"fields\": [ \"created_time\", \"perma_link\", \"text\", \"internal.tags.id\", \"internal.sent_by.id\", \"internal.sent_by.email\", \"internal.sent_by.first_name\", \"internal.sent_by.last_name\" ], \"filters\": [ \"customer_profile_id.eq(1234, 5678, 9012)\", \"created_time.in(2020-04-06T00:00:00..2020-04-19T23:59:59)\" ], \"metrics\": [ \"lifetime.impressions\", \"lifetime.reactions\" ], \"timezone\": \"America/Chicago\", \"page\": 1 }\n\nResponse Data - Post Analytics Endpoint\n\nAn example response:\n\n{ \"data\": [ { \"text\": \"Come by for a cold brew!\", \"perma_link\": \"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-pIo1GFqyl/\", \"metrics\": { \"lifetime.impressions\": 15, \"lifetime.reactions\": 0 }, \"created_time\": \"2020-04-06T14:27:03Z\", \"internal\": { \"tags\": [ {\"id\": 111111}, {\"id\": 111112}, {\"id\": 111113} ], \"sent_by\": { \"id\": 1155555, \"email\": \"sprout.user@sproutsocial.com\", \"first_name\": \"Sprout\", \"last_name\": \"User\" } }, ... ], \"paging\": { \"current_page\": 1, \"total_pages\": 3 } }\n\nPost Request Limits & Pagination\n\ncustomer_profile_id (filters): maximum of 100 profiles per request\n\nPagination of response: pagination is based on 50 messages per response\n\nMessages Endpoint\n\nPOST /v1/<customer ID>/messages\n\nThe messages endpoint provides detailed data and metadata about your Sprout messages.\n\nRequests - Messages Endpoint\n\nThe request body for a Messages request is a JSON object with the following name/values pairs:\n\nKey Description Example filters Refer to the Request Filters section below for details [\"group_id.eq(78910)\", \"customer_profile_id.eq(1234, 5678)\", \"created_time.in(2022-01-01..2022-02-01)\"] fields\n\n(optional) List of fields to return in results.

While you can specify the sort direction, you can only ever get the \"next\" page of data — you can't fetch the \"previous\" page\n\nA Request containing an invalid page_cursor will return a HTTP 400 Bad Request response with a message describing the error\n\nResponse Data - Messages Endpoint\n\nExample response:\n\n{ \"data\": [ { \"post_category\": \"POST\", \"post_type\": \"INSTAGRAM_MEDIA\", \"profile_guid\": \"placeholder\", \"text\": \"placeholder\", \"perma_link\": \"link here\", \"network\": \"INSTAGRAM\", \"internal\": { \"tags\": [ { \"id\": 1234 }, { \"id\": 5678 } ], \"sent_by\": { \"id\": 2066696, \"email\": \"___@sproutsocial.com\", \"first_name\": \"placeholder\", \"last_name\": \"placeholder\" } }, \"created_time\": \"2022-06-09T22:10:54Z\" }, ... ], \"paging\": { \"next_cursor\": \"456def==\" } }\n\nListening Endpoints\n\nListening endpoints are all HTTP POST endpoints. They provide access to your Listening Topic data, including:\n\nMessages - Enables you to query for messages within a given Topic.\n\nMetrics - Aggregates data across the Topic.\n\nOverview\n\nAll requests to and responses from Listening API endpoints have a similar structure.\n\nRequests - Listening Endpoints\n\nThe request body for a Listening API request is a JSON object with the following name/values pairs:\n\nKey Description Example Value filters Detailed filters used to filter the results by message created_time and network. To learn more about advanced filters for Topics see the Filters section. [\"created_time.in(2018-01-01...2018-02-01)\"] metrics List of metrics to return in results; refer to the metrics [\"impressions\", \"likes\"] fields List of fields to return in results; at least one field is required for Listening messages endpoint. Refer to the Listening Message Fields section for full list of valid fields [\"content_category\", \"created_time\", \"from.name\"] page\n\n(optional) In paginated results, which 1-indexed page to return in the response.\n\nPagination is based on default limits of 50 results 3 limit\n\n(optional) Specifies the max number of results per page in the response. Defaults to 50 results for the Listening endpoints. 100 sort\n\n(optional) Sets the sort order for results, specified as a list of fields and directions (asc or desc) in the format <field>:<direction>. [\"created_time:asc\"] timezone\n\n(optional) Time zone—from the ICANN time zone database. Timezone arguments only impact date/time-related filters, responses are not impacted and are always in UTC for posts. \"America/Chicago\" dimensions\n\n(optional) (Topic Metrics endpoints only)\n\nBreaks down metrics into discrete buckets. See Dimensions section to learn what fields work with dimensions. [\"created_time.by(day)\", \"sentiment\"]\n\nFilters - Listening Endpoints\n\nFiltering is a powerful query mechanism that allows you to isolate data within your Topics. You can combine most fields or metrics with the operators below to produce filter to specific data sets using the Topic Messages or Topic Metric endpoints.\n\nOperator Description Example Value gt Greater than likes.gt(10) gte Greater than or equal to engagement_total.gte(5) lt Less than replies.lt(5) lte Less than or equal to impressions.lte(1000) in Specifies a range. A helper that circumvents needed to use a filter with both gt and lt. Using .. is inclusive of the end value while ... is not. Dates and timestamps are accepted. Dates without timestamps are interpreted as midnight of that date, i.e. 2022-06-09 is treated as 2022-06-09T00:00:00. created_time.in(2023-05-01…2023-06-01T23:59:59) eq Equals a particular value. Can contain multiple comma separated values. If multiple values are provided, the filter returns data containing at least one value. network.eq(TWITTER,INSTAGRAM) neq The opposite of eq. network.neq(FACEBOOK) exists Either true or false. Filter finds (or not) messages that meet the criteria of having a value (or not). visual_media.exists(true) match Performs a text search query on a specified field. Multiple comma terms can be provided using spaces, wrap phrases or multiple words in quotes. Messages must match all provided terms. If you want a message that matches any single term, place an OR between terms (e.g. blue OR red). text.match(blue OR red)\n\ntext.match(“the blue car”)\n\ntext.match(blue red green)\n\nYou can apply multiple filters where data must meet all requirements by adding filters to the filters array. An example request using multiple filters:\n\n{ \"filters\": [ \"created_time.in(2022-11-28..2022-12-29T23:59:59)\", \"text.match(blue car)\", \"network.eq(INSTAGRAM,YOUTUBE,LINKEDIN,REDDIT,TUMBLR,WWW)\" ] }\n\nResponses - Listening Endpoints\n\nResponses follow the standard data API response format:\n\ndata\n\nThis array contains the Listening data requested. See specific endpoints for additional details.\n\npaging\n\nThis object specifies the state of paging for this response:\n\nKey Description Example Value current_page 1-indexed page number of the response 3 total_pages Total number of pages for the request 20\n\nA paging object is always returned, including when the response contains all data in one page. You can rely on checking for current_page = total_pages in order to know when you are at the end of the paging sequence.\n\nRequesting a page greater than total_pages will return a HTTP 400 Bad Request response with a message describing the error.\n\nDimensions - Listening Endpoints\n\nDimensions are a powerful tool that allow you to slice and bucket Topic metrics. The most common uses for dimensions would be generating metrics over time (e.g. a trend chart) or breaking down metrics by metadata such as sentiment score. The following Topic fields can be used as a dimension.\n\ncreated_time.by(day)\n\ncreated_time.by(month)\n\nvisual_media.media_type\n\ndistribution_type\n\nnetwork\n\nsentiment\n\nlanguage\n\nexplicit_label\n\nlocation.city\n\nlocation.province\n\nlocation.country\n\nHere is an example of multiple dimensions being used to create a trend chart of sentiment data over time:\n\n{ \"filters\": [ \"created_time.in(2022-11-28..2022-11-30)\", \"network.eq(INSTAGRAM,YOUTUBE,LINKEDIN,REDDIT,TUMBLR,WWW)\" ], \"metrics\": [ \"replies\", \"shares_count\", \"likes\" ], \"dimensions\": [ \"created_time.by(day)\", \"sentiment\" ], \"timezone\": \"America/Chicago\" }\n\nHere is a sample output of this query:\n\n{ \"data\": [ { \"dimensions\": { \"created_time\": \"2022-11-30T00:00:00-06:00\", \"sentiment\": \"positive\" }, \"metrics\": { \"replies\": 29.0, \"shares_count\": 5.0, \"likes\": 557.0 } }, { \"dimensions\": { \"created_time\": \"2022-11-30T00:00:00-06:00\", \"sentiment\": \"neutral\" }, \"metrics\": { \"replies\": 17.0, \"shares_count\": 5.0, \"likes\": 354.0 } }, { \"dimensions\": { \"created_time\": \"2022-11-30T00:00:00-06:00\", \"sentiment\": \"negative\" }, \"metrics\": { \"replies\": 49.0, \"shares_count\": 20.0, \"likes\": 4725.0 } } ], \"paging\": {} }\n\nTopic Messages Endpoint\n\nPOST /v1/<customer ID>/listening/topics/<topic id>/messages\n\nThe Topic messages endpoint enables you to query for messages within a given Topic. The returning data set is an array of matching messages and the requested metrics or fields for each. This endpoint is best used to extract raw messages for further processing or providing sample messages within dashboards.\n\nRequest Body - Topic Messages Endpoint\n\nAn example request:\n\n{ \"filters\": [ \"created_time.in(2022-11-28..2022-12-29T23:59:59)\", \"explicit_label.exists(false), explicit_label.eq(false)\", \"network.eq(INSTAGRAM,YOUTUBE,LINKEDIN,REDDIT,TUMBLR,WWW)\" ], \"fields\": [ \"content_category\", \"created_time\", \"hashtags\", \"language\", \"location.city\" ], \"metrics\": [ \"engagements\", \"from.followers_count\", \"likes\", \"replies\", \"shares_count\", \"authors_count\", \"positive_sentiments_count\", \"neutral_sentiments_count\", \"negative_sentiments_count\" ], \"sort\": [ \"created_time:desc\" ], \"timezone\": \"America/Chicago\", \"limit\": 50, \"page\": 1 }\n\nResponse Data - Topic Messages Endpoint\n\nAn example response:\n\n{ \"data\": [ { \"content_category\": \"PHOTO\", \"guid\": \"17920699361640551\", \"text\": \"Late post from Seattle trip \\nColder than a blizzard in Alaska\\n#seattle #seattlewashington #stevenspass #mtbakersnoqualmienationalforest #mtbaker #snoqualmiepass #snoqualmienationalforest #pikeplacemarket #pikeplace #seattlespaceneedle\", \"perma_link\": \"https://www.instagram.com/p/CmxucH6L7T1/\", \"network\": \"INSTAGRAM\", \"visual_media\": [ { \"media_url\": \"https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/323197452_926427338517295_6369335809654161527_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=y4k7DO4QBHAAX8M7OZ1&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&edm=APCawUEEAAAA&oh=00_AfCps_5bFDmdZE-YVPDwVn5WF3XFWK4PWhd4-uRNTU2iCg&oe=643BF019\", \"media_type\": \"PHOTO\" }, { \"media_url\": \"https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/322406676_8455452681195785_5328220517853332026_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=VpBu3GAXQqoAX_K5LU3&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&edm=APCawUEEAAAA&oh=00_AfD4SCutTw_J7hPbzUJNpAEyaoXd6kBmzHJM-MINZapJmg&oe=643CCB3C\", \"media_type\": \"PHOTO\" }, { \"media_url\": \"https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/322520040_494039015961334_6394396172311331958_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=t6xksNZv91kAX9rE5mL&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&edm=APCawUEEAAAA&oh=00_AfBgn_HEqLsn269mk4oAFXQmbSrbRbxzpbrfwXZLg2F2YQ&oe=643BA80B\", \"media_type\": \"PHOTO\" }, { \"media_url\": \"https://scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/322386857_955848772063194_984682163981872244_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=zIh0QFX3T50AX95k8wg&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com&edm=APCawUEEAAAA&oh=00_AfB7_8ChB-7nq4MXdOaIatp0sCw4ZXqEOoikh-cCoEUIGA&oe=643BE125\", \"media_type\": \"PHOTO\" }, { \"media_url\": \"https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/322393885_1262531494303623_5396853589364944362_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=uzwo3FqbohgAX_wtdqq&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&edm=APCawUEEAAAA&oh=00_AfAZmRdk8Va92UX3FmnjMJo_wf2rxwP5E_5ExT4-TWSSpA&oe=643BD1F1\", \"media_type\": \"PHOTO\" }, { \"media_url\": \"https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/322830314_217584514039146_7428674933900498885_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=m2PtitrP1A0AX8f6gso&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&edm=APCawUEEAAAA&oh=00_AfD6KYXBQVk_BNNQ0FUM8NihyH08v7QF_t61BY3mFdu7sA&oe=643B60F6\", \"media_type\": \"PHOTO\" }, { \"media_url\": \"https://scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/322294142_738549953871939_8482926741552785486_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=k8lcfSt9dhMAX_FZEyt&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com&edm=APCawUEEAAAA&oh=00_AfAQYi1Lx_i-c-SRkWt6tfuhptuuvFx2PlBN1b6fb7kFGA&oe=643CA58A\", \"media_type\": \"PHOTO\" }, { \"media_url\": \"https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/322601354_1215109445751814_6654433182308805760_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=XsbPztVyu-4AX8vsyjC&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&edm=APCawUEEAAAA&oh=00_AfBdQ9GECTdbNtQ-06ruuXQVsN5qPrwKnGsghbaj8uPjig&oe=643B6CDE\", \"media_type\": \"PHOTO\" } ], \"hashtags\": [ \"seattlespaceneedle\", \"snoqualmienationalforest\", \"seattle\", \"stevenspass\", \"pikeplace\", \"seattlewashington\", \"mtbakersnoqualmienationalforest\", \"mtbaker\", \"pikeplacemarket\", \"snoqualmiepass\" ], \"created_time\": \"2022-12-30T03:27:02Z\", \"listening_metadata\": { \"sentiment\": \"neutral\", \"explicit_label\": false, \"language\": \"en\" } } ], \"paging\": { \"current_page\": 1 } }\n\nListening Messages Request Limits and Pagination\n\nPagination of response is based on the following request params:\n\nlimit - number of messages returned per response (max: 100, default: 50)\n\nsort - sort order of messages in response; sorted by message created_time (default: desc)\n\nTopic Metrics Endpoint\n\nPOST /v1/<customer ID>/listening/topics/<topic id>/metrics\n\nThe Topic metrics endpoint aggregates data across the Topic.

Creating a Post via the API will create one or more posts on the Sprout Publishing Calendar.\n\nDraft Post Fan-out\n\nFor draft posts, the current behavior in Sprout and via the API will be to create one post on the calendar per profile on the post (this is referred to as “fan-out”). The unique publishing_post_id in the response will represent a single post on the Sprout Publishing Calendar.\n\nThe API response will not represent the single post on the Sprout Publishing Calendar but instead represent the posts as they would appear on social networks as they would be published in the future. For example, a post created with two profiles (one Facebook, one Instagram) will be represented by two objects in the response: one representing the future Instagram post and the other representing the future Facebook Post.\n\nAnother dimension is possible if the post is scheduled for multiple send times.\n\nFor example, if a post has two profiles (one Facebook, one Instagram) and two scheduled send times, the response will contain four objects: two Instagram posts and two Facebook posts, each containing the deliveries object with one of the scheduled delivery times.\n\nRequest Body - Create Publishing Post Endpoint\n\nAn example request:\n\n{ \"group_id\": 55667788, \"customer_profile_ids\": [ 2345, 5678 ], \"is_draft\": true, \"text\": \"A draft post\", \"delivery\": { \"scheduled_times\": [ \"2024-06-30T18:20:00Z\" ], \"type\": \"SCHEDULED\" }, \"media\": [ { \"media_id\": \"1234-abcd-7890\", \"media_type\": \"PHOTO\" } ] }\n\nResponse Data - Publishing Post Endpoints\n\nAn example response:\n\n{ \"data\": [ { \"post_category\": \"POST\", \"post_type\": \"FACEBOOK_POST\", \"customer_profile_id\": \"2345\", \"profile_guid\": \"fbpr:1112345\", \"internal\": { \"publishing\": { \"publishing_post_id\": 4567890, \"group_id\": 55667788, \"is_draft\": true, \"text\": \"A draft post\", \"perma_link\": \"https://app.sproutsocial.com/publishing/activity/1234/4567890\", \"deliveries\": [ { \"type\": \"SCHEDULED\", \"delivery_status\": \"PENDING\", \"scheduled_time\": \"2024-06-30T18:20:00Z\" } ], \"media\": [ { \"id\": \"6789-defg-5678\", \"media_type\": \"PHOTO\" } ], \"created_by\": { \"id\": 1155555, \"email\": \"sprout.user@sproutsocial.com\", \"first_name\": \"Sprout\", \"last_name\": \"User\" }, \"updated_by\": { \"id\": 1155555, \"email\": \"sprout.user@sproutsocial.com\", \"first_name\": \"Sprout\", \"last_name\": \"User\" }, \"created_time\": \"2024-06-24T19:44:32Z\", \"updated_time\": \"2024-06-24T19:44:32Z\" } } }, { \"post_category\": \"POST\", \"post_type\": \"INSTAGRAM_MEDIA\", \"customer_profile_id\": \"5678\", \"profile_guid\": \"ibpr:5556789\", \"internal\": { \"publishing\": { \"publishing_post_id\": 4567891, \"group_id\": 55667788, \"is_draft\": true, \"text\": \"A draft post\", \"perma_link\": \"https://app.sproutsocial.com/publishing/activity/1234/4567891\", \"deliveries\": [ { \"type\": \"SCHEDULED\", \"delivery_status\": \"PENDING\", \"scheduled_time\": \"2024-06-30T18:20:00Z\" } ], \"media\": [ { \"id\": \"6789-defg-5678\", \"media_type\": \"PHOTO\" } ], \"created_by\": { \"id\": 1155555, \"email\": \"sprout.user@sproutsocial.com\", \"first_name\": \"Sprout\", \"last_name\": \"User\" }, \"updated_by\": { \"id\": 1155555, \"email\": \"sprout.user@sproutsocial.com\", \"first_name\": \"Sprout\", \"last_name\": \"User\" }, \"created_time\": \"2024-06-24T19:44:32Z\", \"updated_time\": \"2024-06-24T19:44:32Z\" } } } ] }\n\nRetrieve Publishing Post Endpoint\n\nGET /v1/<customer ID>/publishing/posts/<publishing_post_id>\n\nRetrieve a Publishing Post by its publishing_post_id.

This media upload system supports three different means to send content to sprout:\n\nSimple Media Upload\n\nMedia files are limited to 50MiB in size\n\nMultipart Media Upload\n\nThis scheme relies on uploading a media file 5MiB at a time\n\nDownload from a Link\n\nThis scheme relies on a publicly available internet reachable file on http/https hosted URLs\n\nThis scheme is built into the single upload or multipart upload paths, and can be treated as either depending on\n\nwhat makes sense for the media file in question. See the individual API endpoint definitions below for the caveats of using one over the other.\n\nLimitations\n\nMedia sent to Sprout via this API are normally retained for 24 hours before is it removed unless used by other API operations\n\nCurrently, the only applicable use of uploaded media is to be used alongside post submissions.\n\nUploaded media must be identified as one of the specified supported media types:\n\nContent Type Common Extension image/png png image/gif gif image/webp webp image/jpeg jpg image/heic heic image/avif avif video/x-msvideo avi video/quicktime mov video/mp4 mp4 video/mpeg mpg image/heic-sequence heifs video/hevc hevc video/avc avc video/av1 av1 image/x-heif-jpeg jpeg image/heif heif video/webm webm video/x-matroska mkv application/x-matroska mkv application/x-subrip srt\n\n** Note: Although this API supports these content types, the target social networks have their own rules on media files which need to be honored. Sprout will not transcode these files into network compatible versions when used with posts. There are some built-in validation rules we enforce when a media file is used with pending posts, but these limitations may not catch every case where a social network rejects a given media file. See this help center page for details on known social network media limitations.\n\nThis endpoint supports uploading a media file in a single request or to request a link download for a media file existing on the internet.\n\nThe request format of this endpoint is multipart/form-data. The request must contain one of two request part names to be provided in each request:\n\nmedia - (Single File Upload) The media file contents in bytes\n\nThe part may contain an optional content disposition which specifies the original content type and file name of the media. Sending this information may help to identify the source content, but it is not mandatory\n\nmedia_url - (Link Download via Single File Upload) A UTF-8 text part containing the HTTP/HTTPS URL of a media file on the internet\n\nResponse\n\nA response code of 200 indicates that the part was submitted successfully. Any other status should be accompanied by a descriptive error for why it failed. Generally, requests in the 4xx code range are fatal errors that require a new media request, whereas 5xx failures are temporary and can be retried with an exponential back-off retry policy.\n\nOn a successful transfer, the resulting payload will be a JSON document containing a media_id text field which can then be used by other API calls when associating said media with post creation activities. The response also contains an expiration_time which shows how long the media will be available for use in a pending post. Any requests associating with this expiration time will fail.\n\nLimitations\n\nMedia sent directly larger than 50 MiB will be rejected\n\nMedia content that is not identified as a know media type will be rejected\n\nFor link download requests, the network request will remain open and not respond until the link download request has been authorized and fully downloaded.\n\nThis transaction trades the convenience of a single request/response with the limitation that the link download needs to complete before a network timeout in order to succeed. If you see consistent sets of timeouts when submitting link download requests on this endpoint, it's advisable to switch to the multipart upload API for link downloads.\n\nExample Request (Simple File Upload)\n\ncurl -s -X POST \\ --form \"media=@$MEDIA_DIR/$MEDIA_FILE;type=image/gif\" \\ https://api.sproutsocial.com/v1/$CUSTOMER/media/ \\ -H \"authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data\"\n\nResponse:\n\n{ \"data\": [ { \"media_id\": \"565fc90f-dd98-4c84-ab17-6f051fb536ce\", \"expiration_time\": \"2023-10-12T11:20:16Z\" } ] }\n\nExample Request (Link Download via Simple File Upload)\n\ncurl -s -X POST \\ --form \"media_url=https://my.public.media.com/my_file.jpg\" \\ https://api.sproutsocial.com/v1/$CUSTOMER/media/ \\ -H \"authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data\"\n\nResponse:\n\n{ \"data\": [ { \"media_id\": \"565fc90f-dd98-4c84-ab17-6f051fb536ce\", \"expiration_time\": \"2023-10-12T11:20:16Z\" } ] }\n\nMultipart Media Upload\n\nMultipart uploads become necessary when managing files larger than 50 MiB, or when media content is expected to take longer to download via link downloading. This benefit is traded with needing to perform multiple requests to the API in order to achieve similar objectives.\n\nProcessing Steps\n\nInitiate a new request for a Multipart upload using the Start multipart media upload steps below.\n\nA successful response here will return a JSON submission_id which will be needed in each subsequent step\n\nThe multipart media request must be completed and used within 24 hours of this initial request\n\nUpload all other parts of the media file using the Continue multipart media upload steps below.\n\nEach file part must be a sequential whole number. The initial upload is considered part 1, so each subsequent part must be 2, 3, 4, etc. until the file is entirely uploaded.\n\nThis can be done sequentially, or in parallel\n\nOnce all parts have been uploaded, finish the upload processing by using the Complete multipart media upload steps below.\n\nLimitations\n\nAll media parts uploaded must be exactly 5MiB (5,242,880 bytes) except for the last upload part, which can be any size > 0 bytes\n\nFor files < 5 MiB send via this API, the \"Start multipart media upload\" step can receive a file under 5 MiB as long as no subsequent parts are sent.\n\nMedia content that is not identified as a know media type will be rejected. This content ID will only occur on the first 5 MiB part of the media, so a failed identification within that file chunk will cause the request to fail\n\nStart multipart media upload\n\nPOST /v1/<customer ID>/media/submission\n\nThis endpoint supports uploading a media file in a single request or to request a link download for a media file existing on the internet.\n\nThe request format of this endpoint is multipart/form-data. The request must contain one of two request part names to be provided in each request:\n\nmedia - The media file part contents in bytes\n\nThe part may contain an optional content disposition which specifies the original content type and file name of the media. Sending this information may help to identify the source content, but it is not mandatory\n\nmedia_url - (Link Download) A UTF-8 text part containing the HTTP/HTTPS URL of a media file on the internet.\n\nWhen if successful, skip to Complete multipart media upload to await the completion of the link download requested.\n\nResponse\n\nA response code of 200 indicates that the part was submitted successfully. Any other status should be accompanied by a descriptive error for why it failed. Generally, requests in the 4xx code range are fatal errors that require a new media request, whereas 5xx failures are temporary and can be retried with an exponential back-off retry policy.\n\nOn a successful request, the resulting payload will be a JSON document containing a submission_id text field. This field is needed for the follow-up Continue multipart media upload and Complete multipart media upload steps.\n\nExample Request\n\ncurl -s -X POST \\ --form \"media=@$MEDIA_DIR/$MEDIA_FILE_PART_1;type=image/gif\" \\ https://api.sproutsocial.com/v1/$CUSTOMER/media/submission \\ -H \"authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data\"\n\nResponse:\n\n{ \"data\": [ { \"submission_id\": \"565fc90f-dd98-4c84-ab17-6f051fb536ce\" } ] }\n\nExample Request (Link Download)\n\ncurl -s -X POST \\ --form \"media_url=https://my.public.media.com/my_file.jpg\" \\ https://api.sproutsocial.com/v1/$CUSTOMER/media/submission \\ -H \"authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data\"\n\nResponse:\n\n{ \"data\": [ { \"submission_id\": \"565fc90f-dd98-4c84-ab17-6f051fb536ce\" } ] }\n\nContinue multipart media upload\n\nPOST /v1/<customer ID>/media/submission/<submission_id>/part/<part_number>\n\nIf the media file part uploaded in Start multipart media upload was 5 MiB, and there are still more bytes to upload, the continue multipart media endpoint needs to be called continually with each part of the media file until its entirely uploaded. It uses the same multipart/form-data structure as the initial submission URL, but this one is slightly different.\n\nThe URL contains a part number. It must represent a whole number starting at 2. This continues ascending (3,4,5,etc...) until you've upload all the data bytes of the source media.\n\nThe form's media disposition is not needed and will be ignored. The content type of this data is implicitly application/octet-stream\n\nThere are no requirements about executing these upload parts in parallel if desired. If any part submission fails, they can be uploaded again as long as the 24-hour expiration hasn't lapsed on the original upload request and as long as the final completion step hasn't been executed.\n\nResponse\n\nA response code of 200 indicates that the part was submitted successfully. Any other status should be accompanied by a descriptive error for why it failed. Generally, requests in the 4xx code range are fatal errors that require a new media request, whereas 5xx failures are temporary and can be retried with an exponential back-off retry policy.\n\nThis API endpoint has no payload response when it succeeds.\n\nExample Request(s)\n\ncurl -s -X POST \\ --form \"media=@$MEDIA_DIR/$MEDIA_FILE_PART_2\" \\ https://api.sproutsocial.com/v1/$CUSTOMER/media/submission/$SUBMISSIONID/part/2 \\ -H \"authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data\"\n\ncurl -s -X POST \\ --form \"media=@$MEDIA_DIR/$MEDIA_FILE_PART_3\" \\ https://api.sproutsocial.com/v1/$CUSTOMER/media/submission/$SUBMISSIONID/part/3 \\ -H \"authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data\"\n\nResponse:\n\nA response code of 200 indicates that the part was submitted successfully. Any other status should be accompanied by a descriptive error for why it failed.\n\n(no body response)\n\nComplete multipart media upload\n\nGET /v1/<customer ID>/media/submission/<submission_id>\n\nResponse\n\nA response code of 200 or 202 indicates that the request was good. Any other status should be accompanied by a descriptive error for why it failed. Generally, requests in the 4xx code range are fatal errors that require a new media request, whereas 5xx failures are temporary and can be retried with an exponential back-off retry policy.\n\nExample Request (Not ready)\n\ncurl -s -X GET \\ https://api.sproutsocial.com/v1/$CUSTOMER/media/submission/$SUBMISSIONID \\ -H \"authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\"\n\nResponse:\n\nHTTP Status 202 indicates that the request is good, but the media is not ready to be served yet. This process can take seconds to minutes depending on the size of the content and if it was a link download or direct upload. If you receive this response, please defer retrying the request until the wait_until time has lapsed. If a high number of calls occur in a short duration, the requests could be rate limited and further complicate the processing of this request.\n\n{ \"data\": [ { \"submission_id\": \"febca520-f44e-4b7c-b451-04a911c53f0f\", \"wait_until\": \"2024-04-22T17:03:21.600802351Z\" } ] }\n\nExample Request (ready)\n\nHTTP Status 200 indicates that the request succeeded and that the media_id returned in the response body is now good to use in other subsequent API requests.\n\nResponse:\n\n{ \"data\": [ { \"media_id\": \"565fc90f-dd98-4c84-ab17-6f051fb536ce\", \"expiration_time\": \"2023-10-12T11:20:16Z\" } ] }\n\nMetrics and Fields\n\nMessage Metadata\n\nMessage Fields\n\nKey Type Network Availability Notes content_category STRING Unified categorization of the content.

      "# [Social media marketing: What it is and how to build your strategy by Jamia Kenan on 2024-08-22](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-marketing-strategy/)\nLooking to fine-tune your social media marketing strategy? Now’s the perfect time to make it happen. In a landscape with more competition, content and networks than ever, a succinct strategy gives you the focus needed to say “no” to efforts that don’t serve your goals.\n\nThat’s why we put together a comprehensive guide to creating a social media marketing plan from scratch. Whether you’re totally new to social or want to double-check your priorities in 2024, this guide has you covered.\n\nWhat is social media marketing?\n\nSocial media marketing means using social media platforms like Instagram, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Facebook to promote your brand and sell your product or service.\n\nIf your business comes out with a new item and you plan to promote the launch on social media, that’s social media marketing. If you interact with your customers via comments, that’s social media marketing. And if you create engaging content that showcases your brand’s values and story, that’s social media marketing too.\n\nThis form of marketing requires you to use social media management skills and tools. Just as you prepare other aspects of your marketing strategy, you need to have a plan for your social media marketing.\n\nWhat is a social media marketing strategy?\n\nA social media marketing strategy is a comprehensive plan that integrates your social media efforts with your team’s goals and the broader business objectives. This alignment ensures that your activities are not only optimized for performance but also deliver measurable results that contribute to your overall marketing success.\n\nA well-defined social media marketing strategy also sets clear boundaries around your team’s time and expertise. Social media is a unique channel, and while nearly everyone uses it, this widespread usage often leads people to overestimate their expertise.\n\nEvery social media manager has faced requests to share content that isn’t formatted correctly or doesn’t align with the overarching campaign. Having a robust social media marketing strategy empowers you to confidently say “no” when necessary, ensuring that your efforts remain focused and effective.\n\nWhat are the benefits of a social media strategy?\n\nThis question can feel like a bit of a no-brainer to marketers that live and breathe social. That said, being able to clearly articulate the advantages of a cohesive social media strategy is crucial for securing buy-in from other stakeholders. Here’s how a well-defined social media strategy benefits your brand and business:\n\nIt increases brand awareness and engagement\n\nAccording to The Sprout Social Index™ 2023, more than half (53%) of consumers say their social media usage has increased over the last two years. Amid a fractured cultural landscape, social media has emerged to fill a seemingly endless need for content.\n\nWhen brands commit to a cohesive social media marketing strategy, they develop the consistency needed to form a brand identity that cuts through the noise to resonate with a target audience. Case in point: Figo Pet Insurance.\n\nIn 2022, the Figo team committed to sharing four to five TikTok videos per week. Over time, they were able to pinpoint what messages appeal to their audience. These efforts led to audience growth and multiple viral videos.\n\nAs you refine your strategy over time, you too can craft more precise messaging that not only attracts more fans but also drives greater engagement.\n\nIt promotes brand trust\n\nSocial’s impact on brand trust is palpable, particularly for younger consumers.\n\nAccording to a Q2 2024 Sprout Pulse Survey, 78% of consumers surveyed strongly/somewhat agree that—compared to a year ago—a brand’s social media presence has a larger impact on whether or not they trust that brand. That number goes up to 88% for Gen Z. What influences that trust the most? The content you post on social.\n\nIn the 2010s, a poorly designed website might deter consumers due to concerns about fraud. Today, the same principle applies to social media. If consumers get to your profiles and see irregular updates, inconsistent messaging or content that doesn’t align with where it’s been posted, it’s going to raise red flags and undermine trust.\n\nIt supports performance measurement\n\nYour social media marketing strategy creates the infrastructure needed to prove the ROI of your efforts. Without one, you may be able to report on social media KPIs, but it'll be much harder to showcase how they align with strategic objectives.\n\nFor example, say you work with an automotive brand and one of your top business objectives is to increase market share with parents of young children. With that in mind, you can develop a strategic content pillar around this specific audience, and report on the performance of those posts over time.\n\nWith a social listening tool, you can even measure how your brand’’s share of voice stacks up against key competitors. This is a highly effective way to gauge your brand’s visibility and market share within your industry.\n\nLearn more about social listening tools\n\nIt drives revenue\n\nOur Q2 2024 Pulse Survey also found that social media is the top channel for product discovery, with 81% of consumers surveyed using the channel to shop around for their next purchase.\n\nAs social commerce adoption continues to skyrocket in the US and abroad, social media now supports a full-funnel experience. Even B2B brands are using social media to enhance lead generation and drive pipeline growth.\n\nFor example, when Simpli.fi, an advertising success platform, integrated employee advocacy into their social media strategy, the company realized $90,000 in earned media value in three months.\n\nHow to create a social media marketing strategy\n\nNow that we’ve defined social media marketing and its benefits, let’s walk through how to create a plan.\n\nHere’s our six-step process for developing a social media marketing strategy that drives results.\n\nStep 1: Set goals and establish KPIs\n\nSocial media strategy planning starts with your goals. Whether you want to expand your team, build a larger following or a more active community, taking the time to define your social goals is the first step to reaching them.\n\nThe goals you set will inform the key performance indicators (KPIs) you track, and how much time and energy you’ll need to dedicate to your campaigns.\n\nExample social media goals for 2024 and beyond\n\nWhat really matters is that you set realistic social media goals. We recommend tackling smaller objectives that allow you to scale your social efforts in a way that’s both reasonable and affordable.\n\nBelow are some example social media marketing goals that businesses of all shapes and sizes can pursue.\n\nGoal example 1: Increase brand awareness\n\nBrand awareness means getting your name out there. Some 68% of consumers say the primary reason they follow a brand on social media is to stay informed about new products or services, according to The Sprout Social Index™.\n\nTry to avoid solely publishing promotional messages and strike a good balance with authentic content that emphasizes your brand’s voice and story. The Sprout Social Index™ found that consumers don’t see enough authentic, non-promotional content from brands on social.\n\nFor example, in this TikTok video, Sani, a family-owned apparel company features a day in the life of the brand’s founders while visiting India for business.\n\nIf you want to increase brand awareness, here are the social media metrics you’ll want to focus on:\n\nReach: Post reach is the number of unique users who saw your post. How much of your content actually reaches users’ feeds?\n\nImpressions: At the post level, impressions are how many times a post is displayed to someone. Impressions are a good indicator of how popular a piece of content is, and that people may be viewing a post multiple times.\n\nHashtag performance: What were your most-used hashtags? Which hashtags were most associated with your brand? Having these answers can help shape the focus of your content going forward.\n\nVideo views: This may come off as a vanity metric. But on certain channels, like TikTok, views count as impressions, and are therefore important to monitor.\n\nGoal example 2: Generate leads and sales\n\nWhether online, in-store or directly through your social profiles, followers don’t make purchases by accident. For example, are you alerting customers about new products and promos? Are you integrating your product catalog into your social profiles? Are you running exclusive deals for followers? Social media gives you an avenue to generate revenue.\n\nHere are the metrics you’ll want to track if you’re focused on lead generation and sales:\n\nConversions: A conversion is when someone takes a desired action, like purchasing something from your site or signing up for an upcoming event.\n\nConversion rate: Conversion rate measures how well your social ad or campaign is convincing people to take a desired action.\n\nGoal example 3: Grow your brand’s audience\n\nBringing new followers into the fold means finding ways to introduce your brand to folks who haven’t heard of you before. Growing your audience also means discovering conversations around your business and industry that matter the most.\n\nDigging through your social channels is nearly impossible without monitoring or listening for specific keywords, phrases or hashtags. Having a pulse on these conversations helps you expand your core audience (and reach adjacent audiences) much faster.\n\nImportant audience growth metrics include:\n\nFollower growth: Your follower growth measures the net new followers you gained in a specific time period.\n\nFollower growth rate: The percentage that shows you how quickly your audience is actually growing—or slowing—within a certain time period.\n\nGoal example 4: Provide holistic customer care\n\nThe Index shows over half of consumers believe the most memorable thing a brand can do on social media is respond to customers.\n\nAlthough 76% of consumers value quick responses, providing quality customer care isn’t just responding rapidly. Consumer expectations have evolved. Some 70% of consumers expect brands to provide a holistic experience with personalized responses that fit their unique customer service needs.\n\nThis means companies need to experiment with messaging and content when approaching customer care. For example, does your team have a protocol for handling @-mentions and comments? Do you have templated responses to FAQs? Does your brand promote user-generated content and hashtags? Your customers can be your best cheerleaders, but only if you give them a reason to grab the megaphone.\n\nIf you want to improve your business’ approach to social customer care, here are the customer service metrics you need to track:\n\nAverage first reply time: The time it takes for your team to send out the first reply to an inbound customer message within business hours.\n\nReply or response rate: The rate that brands respond to messages or comments that they receive on a daily basis.\n\nResolution rate: The percentage of customer inquiries that are fully resolved. This metric can reveal how equipped your entire company is to address customer inquiries.\n\nGoal example 5: Drive traffic to your site to illustrate ROI of social efforts\n\nThe Sprout Social Index™ shows 46% of marketers plan to calculate the return on investment (ROI) of advertising spend to connect the value of social to business goals in 2024.\n\nSimple enough. If you’re laser-focused on generating leads or traffic to your website, social media can make it happen. Whether through organic promotional posts or social ads, keeping an eye on the following metrics can help you better determine your ROI from social media:\n\nWebsite traffic: Monitoring website traffic can help you properly attribute increases to specific campaigns or viral posts.\n\nSocial media referral traffic: This describes people who visit your website directly from social media pages and posts.\n\nAny combination of these goals is fair game and can help you better understand which networks to tackle, too. When in doubt, keep your social media marketing strategy simple rather than complicating it with too many objectives that might distract you. Pick one or two and rally your team around them.\n\nBonus resource: A great deck can bridge the gap between raw social data and direct business value.

Both leaders and practitioners can disprove assumptions from the valuable insights social data provides. With the right tool, marketers can quickly research their audience. No formal market research or data science chops necessary.\n\nWhat you need to know about your audience to influence your social media marketing strategy is already available. You just have to know where to look.\n\nRemember: different platforms attract different audiences. Social media demographics and benchmark statistics are great for understanding where your target audience lives, but it's also important to understand the nuances of each social network so you can decide where your business needs to be.\n\nFor the sake of narrowing down where you should spend your time, below is a quick overview of each of the major social platforms:\n\nX\n\nSimple and straightforward, X is a solid starting point for most businesses. Requiring minimal setup and providing a place to go back and forth with followers directly, there's a reason why X remains one of the go-to platforms for customer service. If you’re trying to master the social media marketing basics of hashtags, tagging, brand voice and social media etiquette, look no further.\n\nFacebook\n\nFacebook is a must-have for brick-and-mortar businesses looking to target local customers. Allowing check-ins and reviews, it’s a prime place to grow a dedicated local following. Plus, they have an incredible chatbot functionality that can take your customer service strategy and marketing campaigns to the next level.\n\nLike many social algorithm changes, the platform’s algorithm change in late 2022 posed a challenge to some businesses looking to grow their Pages and stay in touch with fans consistently. The earliest algorithm prioritized Likes, but today’s is much more sophisticated and focuses on showing users the most relevant, meaningful content based on inventory, signals, relevancy scoring and other factors. That said, Facebook’s ad platform is the gold standard for social media ads because it can help businesses cut through the noise and lessen the impact of algorithm changes.\n\nInstagram\n\nAt its core, Instagram is a network centered around visual content. A major hub for brick-and-mortar businesses, e-commerce shops and influencers alike, the platform encourages brands to get creative. From eye-popping photos to clever captions, it’s all about finding unique ways to show off what you’re selling.\n\nThreads\n\nWhen Meta released Threads on July 5, 2023, the social network received over 100 million registrations less than a week after its launch, making it the most rapidly downloaded app ever. The launch of Threads sparked conversations about its role in the fediverse, or decentralized social media.\n\nBut, for now, Threads is a text-based social network that users can sign up for through their current Instagram account. Users can post on mobile, but Threads is also available on desktop. Threads are great for brands who already have Instagram accounts because the sign-up process is pretty seamless.\n\nLinkedIn\n\nLinkedIn is a network laser-focused on business trends and networking. LinkedIn is a goldmine, especially for anyone networking in the B2B space. Looking to get in touch with an influencer, marketing manager or CEO? Chances are you can find them here.\n\nThere are so many benefits of using LinkedIn marketing beyond networking, including content distribution and lead generation. We also have a guide for LinkedIn best practices so you can get full advantage of those benefits.\n\nPinterest\n\nPinterest marketing is insanely popular, especially among Gen Z and Millennials. Over 465 million people use this visual pinning platform every month to find inspiration and their next purchase. Pinterest is noted to be one of the best networks for social selling. Like Instagram, Pinterest thrives on imagery and inspirational content where products serve as the proverbial centerpiece.\n\nTikTok\n\nTikTok reached 1 billion users in September 2021 and remains one of the most popular apps in the world. Along with its viral trends and niche communities, the short-form video app is known for its hyper-personalized algorithm that keeps users scrolling for hours. TikTok marketing has changed the game for brands, allowing them to connect with customers in an entirely new way.\n\nYouTube\n\nAlthough some might not regard YouTube as a traditional social network, the platform’s active and engaged community speaks for itself. Considering that video represents the top-performing type of content across nearly every social network, YouTube is a great place to house your videos if you’re already producing them.\n\nPicking networks for your social media marketing strategy\n\nThere are more than 15 social media platforms your brand can use, but don’t spread yourself too thin. Rather than try to dominate them all, you should consider which platforms make the most sense based on your industry and target audience.\n\nDo your homework on your existing social media audience and focus on networks where your core audience is already active. You need to do further analysis before you can determine what your real-world social customers actually look like.\n\nThat’s why many brands use a social media marketing dashboard that provides an overview of who’s following you and how they interact with you on each channel.\n\nFor example, Sprout’s analytics dashboard puts your audience demographics front and center. It highlights which social networks see the most activity, helping you ensure you spend your time on the right network.\n\nYou can also use analytics to determine if you should create a new social media account. With Sprout, you can view X, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube and Pinterest data side-by-side in a customizable format that’s exportable by date range and profile.\n\nThere are plenty of other sources of valuable audience data to supplement your social media insights. This includes your Google and email analytics, your CRM, your customer service platform or even your best-selling products.\n\nAll of the above will ultimately influence everything from your marketing messaging to how you’ll approach customer service or social commerce.\n\nStep 3: Create (and curate) timely & engaging social content\n\nNo surprises here. Your social media marketing strategy hinges on your content. At this point, you should have a pretty good idea of what to publish based on your goals, audience and brand identity. You probably feel confident in which networks to cover, too.\n\nBut what about your content strategy? Below are some tips, ideas and inspiration that can help.\n\nDefining your content strategy\n\nComing up with a content strategy might seem like a lot of legwork, but it all really boils down to your goals.\n\nLooking to educate your audience in the B2B space? Publish blogs, news and opinions relevant to your industry.\n\nTrying to push e-commerce products? Post action shots of your products and photos of others showing off your swag.\n\nFocused on customer service? Tips, shout-outs and company updates are fair game.\n\nRegardless of what you might post, coming up with a hashtag to couple with your content is a brilliant branding move.\n\nHashtags can be used to get your attention and encourage people to share their photos interacting with your brand.\n\nFind your brand voice\n\nOne of the best ways to stand out on social media is to define your distinct brand voice. Chances are you’ve seen a post from a particular brand that just feels like, well, theirs.\n\nThe quippy, casual tone that makes Discord’s X presence beloved by casual users and moderators alike is a great example.\n\nOf course, not every company will benefit from the same sort of tone. The key is to present yourself as a human rather than a robot. Adopt a consistent brand voice and style that’s appropriate for your business.\n\nBake timeliness into your strategy\n\nTimeliness is arguably more important than ever for marketers. Not only are you expected to put out fresh content regularly, but also to always be “on” for your followers. But you can’t always expect customers to operate on your clock. And timeliness is a tall order when you’re strapped for resources or are part of a small team.\n\nAs evidenced by our best times to post on social, brands have a lot of ground to cover in terms of frequency and how much content to push. It’s important to pay attention to the optimal times for engagement so you can automate the most tedious aspects of your social presence without having to worry about posting in real time.\n\nBut, quick question: When is your brand available to engage and interact with customers?\n\nYou might see some recommended times to post late in the evening, for example. But if your team isn’t there to communicate, what’s the point of posting at the “preferred” time?\n\nWhen you’re able to do so, ensure your social media or community managers are available and ready to answer any product questions or concerns when you post. Take time to review the best times to post on social media, but remember that it’s just as critical to engage after posting\n\nYou should also consider taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and automation so you can serve and engage with customers when your team is offline, which leads us to our next point.\n\nTake advantage of short-form video\n\nThanks to the rise of TikTok and Instagram Reels, social video is booming. Short-form productions continue to dominate the social space across all platforms due to their high engagement rate.\n\nSprout Social’s 2022 Index data shows that consumers find short-form videos 2.5x more engaging than long-form ones. Some 66% of consumers report paying the most attention to short-form content as well.\n\nThanks to advancements in DIY and remote video production, you don’t need massive budgets to be successful. All you need is a laptop or smartphone and a few tricks of the trade, like video length best practices and editing tools.\n\nShare posts that show off your brand’s uniqueness and human side\n\nBoth personal and personable content should be a cornerstone of your social media marketing strategy. Don’t be afraid to remind followers of the humans behind your posts. Remember that over a third of consumers are looking for authentic, original content from brands.\n\nFor example, Zoom has excellent original content on their Instagram and TikTok accounts, like this Reel that explores the different signs in the workplace:\n\nStep 4: Collaborate with influencers\n\nIf you haven’t already, it’s time to tap into the power of influencer marketing. Social partnerships are very effective when executed correctly: they can help drive traffic to your website, produce compelling content and inspire purchase decisions.\n\nBut consumers care about creators’ qualifications, so choose wisely. The two most important qualifications of content creators working with brands is their experience with the product/service and their authenticity.\n\nIdentify creators who align with your brand and consider how they can help you craft stand-out content for your audience.\n\nWhat consumers want from influencer-brand collaborations\n\nAccording to the 2024 Influencer Marketing Report, consumers overall look to engage with influencers who align with their personal values (53%) and seem authentic (47%), even when posting sponsored content and taking part in brand campaigns.\n\nAcross ages and genders, honest and unbiased content stops audiences mid-scroll, while aspirational content is least likely to catch their attention.\n\nHowever, the report also found that authenticity is losing its appeal among younger generations. While trust in influencers remains strong—and is even growing among younger consumers—only 35% of Gen Z value authenticity, compared to nearly half of Millennials, Gen X‌ and Baby Boomers.\n\nThis indicates that younger generations are more aware of the influencer-brand relationship and how it influences their buying decisions, but they’re comfortable with it. Instead, they prioritize other indicators of trustworthiness, such as follower count, posting frequency‌ and community loyalty.\n\nStep 5: Bring other departments into the mix\n\nSocial media teams have a unique advantage when it comes to understanding customer sentiment. You’re the eyes and ears for your brand online. Those insights can do more than just inform marketing strategy.\n\nThey can transform your business. Stand-out social media teams will approach cross-department collaboration with enthusiasm and intention.\n\nWhich departments can benefit from social data?\n\nThe short answer? All of them. Index data shows 76% of social marketers say their team’s insights inform other departments.\n\nHowever, don’t bite off more than you can chew. Instead, start where you think you can make the most impact. Here are a few ideas to jumpstart your strategy.\n\nHuman Resources\n\nCollaborating with human resources on social-first employer brand initiatives can do more than just fill open roles quickly. It can attract stronger, more qualified candidates as well. Many companies have embraced social recruiting strategies, such as publishing creative “we’re hiring” posts on LinkedIn to attract top talent.\n\nSales\n\nData from The 2023 Sprout Social Index™ notes marketers plan to track conversations and sales directly resulting from social efforts in 2024 to better connect the value of social to business goals. Sharing social insights with your sales organization can empower reps to work smarter in the context of increasingly digital customer journeys. Consider learning more about social selling to leverage the power of online networks even further.\n\nProduct and merchandising\n\nYou’ve probably received quite a few feature or product requests while managing your brand’s social inbox.\n\nWith a social media management tool, you can distill those messages into actionable insights for your product or merchandising teams. These insights can complement existing roadmap research, creating a customer-focused plan that delights.\n\nCustomer care\n\nMonitoring customer service metrics like average reply time, average wait time and response volume can help your social customer care team identify what is working well and spot opportunities for improvement. Marketers are using social media customer service software to elevate their support strategies and get the most out of their tech stack.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate and improve your social media strategy\n\nBy now you should have a big-picture understanding of your social media strategy. However, it’s important to adapt your strategy throughout the year.\n\nWithout continuously analyzing your efforts, you’ll never know how one campaign did over another. Having a bird’s eye view of your social media activity helps put things into perspective. This means looking at your top-performing content and adjusting your campaigns when your content stalls.\n\nThere’s no denying that a lot of social media is a matter of trial-and-error. Monitoring the metrics behind your campaigns in real time allows you to make small tweaks to your social media marketing strategy rather than sweeping, time-consuming changes.\n\nDoing social media marketing right starts by being diligent about your data. You can be reactive in the short term to get the most out of your running campaigns, and then proactively use these takeaways to inform your next strategy overhaul.\n\nTo guarantee that you get in front of as many customers as possible, monitoring your growth is a major must-do. With Sprout, social reports can clue you in on everything from your top-performing content to how engaged your audience is. These reports are crucial for accountability and guaranteeing your numbers continue to tick upward.\n\nReporting on data is also important for the sake of sharing valuable insights from social with your coworkers and colleagues. Remember that 60% of organizations use social data daily—be one of the brands that embrace it.\n\nSharing this information in regular reports not only holds you accountable for your efforts but also highlights the impact and bottom-line results your social strategy produces.\n\nBased on your data, you can better assess whether your KPIs truly ladder up to your overarching company goals or whether they need to change.\n\nAnd with that, we wrap up your social media strategy guide for 2024 and beyond!\n\nIs your social media marketing strategy future proof?\n\nThis guide highlights plenty of moving pieces to maintain a modern social presence. That said, putting together yours doesn’t have to be a drag.\n\nIf you set actionable goals and address each of the steps above, you’ll already be way ahead of the curve when it comes to your social media marketing strategy.",

This data helps you tailor your marketing strategies to boost engagement and ROI.\n\nStats can also help you benchmark your own performance within your industry and even uncover new opportunities.\n\nUse the social media marketing statistics below to guide your presence in 2024 and beyond.\n\nSocial media usage statistics\n\nIt’s no secret that we’re all glued to social media (my screen time data supports this). To get a better idea of how glued users are, let's look at some social media usage statistics.\n\nBelow is a quick snapshot of how social media demographics and usage are changing, which networks are winning and how hooked consumers are on social.\n\nIn 2024, there are estimated to be 5.17 billion total social media users worldwide.\n\nThe average person uses 6.7 different social networks per month.\n\nThe amount of time internet users spend on social media declined slightly to 143 minutes per day.\n\nTikTok is the fastest-growing platform with a staggering 100% user growth rate between 2020 and 2022. And between Q3 2022 and Q3 2023, TikTok's monthly active users grew 13%.\n\nThe number of social media users worldwide grew by 320 million people from January 2023 to January 2024.\n\nGrowth may seem slow, but that's due to the sheer number of people who already use social media. This means social media presents a huge opportunity for marketers and advertisers.\n\nHowever, with users spread across several platforms, it’s more important than ever for brands to take a multi-channel approach. Don't forget to leverage emerging platforms like TikTok to reach new audiences and stand out from the competition.\n\nSocial media advertising statistics\n\nAs organic reach decreases on nearly every platform, paid social media advertising becomes a must-use strategy for reaching your target audience. Learn more about social advertising stats to inform your strategy.\n\nTotal spend on social media advertising is projected to reach $219.8 billion in 2024.\n\nIt's now projected that $255.8 billion of total social media ad spending will be generated through mobile by 2028.\n\nTotal ad spend growth is anticipated at 6.1% in 2024.\n\nSocial media ads account for 28.8% of all digital advertising spend.\n\nBusinesses put around 8.7% of their total revenue towards their ads budget.\n\nSocial media ad spend is growing at a steady rate. With more marketers investing in ads, brands should get ready to allocate bigger budgets to paid marketing strategies to compete.\n\nFacebook statistics\n\nFacebook remains an advertising powerhouse. Whether or not brands should focus on Facebook is a tough question that really depends on your individual Facebook metrics. The following Facebook statistics can clue you in further.\n\nFacebook is the most-used platform by marketers worldwide (89%). Instagram sits in second place (80%).\n\nAs of Q3 2023, Facebook is the largest online social network in the world with roughly 3.05 billion monthly active users.\n\nThe average American spends about 31 minutes per day on Facebook.\n\n56.3% of Facebook users are male and 43.7% are female (based on available gender data).\n\nAlmost a quarter of Facebook users in the US are between the ages 25-34.\n\nFacebook remains a favorite among marketers. That’s not surprising, considering the massive reach offered by the platform. Plus, the increasing average age means more users are in high-level, decision-making positions in their careers.\n\nInstagram statistics\n\nInstagram boasts 2 billion actively monthly users and yet brands are still scrambling to get more Instagram followers. Below are the top social media statistics for Instagram.\n\nInstagram ties with Facebook for the social media platform with the highest ROI.\n\n27.4% of US Instagram users are between 25 and 34 years old.\n\n61.1% of total Instagram users worldwide are between the ages 18-34, and mostly identify as male.\n\nInstagram Reels generate more likes and saves, but fewer comments than regular posts.\n\nInstagram’s engagement rates are four times higher than Facebook (0.60% to 0.15%), but engagement has become more competitive each year.\n\nIn 2023, 43% of marketers plan to increase their investment in Instagram.\n\nOnce the go-to social platform for influencers, Instagram is facing competition from TikTok.\n\nStill, relatively high engagement rates, fresh ecommerce features and big ad spending signal that the future is still bright for Instagram.\n\nLinkedIn statistics\n\nLinkedIn has done a brilliant job of carving out its niche as the go-to professional network. The platform is a potential goldmine for B2B brands and the rapid growth of their ad platform speaks for itself. Here are some LinkedIn statistics you should know.\n\nThere are more than more than 1 billion members across 200 countries on LinkedIn.\n\nThe United States has the highest user rate in the world on LinkedIn with an audience reach of over 214 million users.\n\nThere are over 67 million company profiles on LinkedIn.\n\n60% of worldwide users are between ages 25 and 34 years old, far exceeding any other age group.\n\nSpurred by the widespread career changes over the past two years, the platform doesn’t look to slow down any time soon. Hint: now’s the time to level up your LinkedIn marketing if you’re in B2B.\n\nPinterest statistics\n\nPinterest often doesn’t get its due when it comes to social platforms. The platform’s diverse, big-spending audience is among the most dedicated and engaged of any network. Here are some top Pinterest statistics to look out for.\n\n482 million people use Pinterest every month.\n\n76.2% of Pinterest users are women, 17.2% are men and 6.6% are unspecified.\n\nIn December 2023 alone, nearly 1.2 billion visits were measured to Pinterest.com, from desktop and mobile.\n\n76.2% of worldwide Pinterest users identify as female.\n\nPinterest is the third-most visited social media website in the US.\n\n80% of weekly users have found a new brand or product on the platform.\n\nThe power of Pinterest advertising is well-documented and the platform is the perfect place to uncover new products. Also, marketers targeting a US audience would do well to include Pinterest in their marketing efforts.\n\nTikTok statistics\n\nTikTok has totally transformed itself to a must-have digital platform for brands. The platform’s rabid fanbase, rapid growth and sky-high usage spell great news for early adopters. Below are some interesting TikTok statistics to know about.\n\nTikTok is expected to reach over 2 billion users in 2024.\n\nTikTok is the most frequently used app worldwide, with Android phone users spending an average of 34 hours per month on the platform.\n\nTikTok’s user base skews female, with 48% of users identifying as women (based on available gender data.)\n\n36.7% of TikTok users are 18-24 years old and account for the largest share of TikTok’s advertising audience.\n\nTikTok is the second-most used video entertainment app by monthly active users.\n\nYounger consumers and smaller influencers dominate the platform right now, but that may change in the very near future. If you’re already on the platform, make sure to watch your TikTok analytics and how to reach your audience ASAP.\n\nX (formerly Twitter) statistics\n\nX, formerly Twitter, has cemented itself as the hub of political discussions, memes and a prime place to go back and forth with brands. Take a look at the Twitter statistics below to understand more about marketing on the platform.\n\nX boasts about 619 million monthly active users in total worldwide.\n\n53% of X users use the platform to get the latest news.\n\nMore than half (63%) of X users are men (based on available gender data).\n\n33% of users plan to spend less time on X in 2024.\n\nUS adults spend an average of 34.1 minutes daily on X.\n\nEven with the uncertainty of Z's future because of its last year, the platform appears to be growing, so marketers may not want to count it out yet.\n\nYouTube statistics\n\nTo compete with emerging platforms like TikTok, the second-largest search engine in the world is making some big changes. Here are the top YouTube statistics to know about.\n\nAs of January 2023, YouTube has nearly 2.5 billion users worldwide.\n\nYouTube Shorts has 2 billion monthly active users.\n\nYouTube's biggest gender segments are males aged between 25-34 (12.2%), and males aged between 35-44 (9.6%) (based on available gender data).\n\nYouTube users spend an average of 28 hours, 5 minutes on the Android app each month.\n\nNearly 90% of all visits to YouTube come from a mobile device.\n\nDespite the platforms in the market, YouTube is still users’ go-to video-sharing and video-consumption platform. With more people accessing the app on mobile, marketers would benefit from posting more short-form, vertical content (i.e. Shorts) on the platform.\n\nSocial media video statistics\n\nVideo continues to be an all-time favorite content type. It’s versatile, engaging and offers excellent ROI to marketers worldwide. Let’s look at some recent social media video statistics.\n\n44% of people prefer to learn about a new product or service via short video content.\n\n87% of marketers say video marketing has directly increased sales.\n\nShort-form video offers marketers the highest ROI of any social media marketing strategy, with 30-60 videos seeing the most success.\n\nUS video advertising is expected to increase from $76.97 billion in 2023 to $84.61 billion in 2024.\n\nVideo is making its way into all types of marketing strategies in virtually every industry. However, it’s evolving in its shape and form. Brands can expect to see better results from short-form video content that’s primarily entertaining and/or funny.\n\nInfluencer marketing statistics\n\nWorking with influencers is one of the best inbound marketing strategies being used today. Here are some influencer marketing statistics about which platforms marketers are leveraging, what they’re hoping to achieve and how they plan to execute influencer marketing in the future.\n\n50.1% of marketers believe TikTok offers the highest ROI to influencer marketers for short-form video content, followed by 29.9% of marketers saying Instagram Reels and 12% saying YouTube Shorts.\n\n69% of marketers use TikTok for influencer marketing, making it the most popular influencer marketing channel.\n\nGenerating more engagement, reaching new audiences and strengthening community are the top three marketing goals for working with creators.\n\n60% of marketers plan to spend more on influencer marketing campaigns in 2024.\n\n63% of marketers plan to use AI in launching their influencer campaigns. And 55% of these brands will use AI for identifying influencers.\n\nMore marketers are realizing the potential of influencer marketing. If influencers are not already part of your marketing efforts, it’s time to switch your focus. The key is to pick the best platforms and influencers for your brand, both of which can be automated using the right tools.\n\nConsumer behavior statistics\n\nThe concept of buying something you saw on social media is nothing new. From product recommendations to first impressions from brands, the impact of social media on consumers is well-documented. Learn more from these consumer behavior statistics.\n\n56.1% of internet users purchase a product online at least once a week.\n\n29.9% of internet users purchase a product using their mobile devices at least once a week.\n\n51.2% of people research brands online before making a purchase.\n\nThe biggest online purchase drivers across all ages are free shipping, coupons and discounts, or an easy return policy.\n\nThe recent growth of direct social sales is notable. Consumers likewise crave authenticity and ads that don’t feel like ads. But the key to selling on social is to know your customer, which platforms they prefer and how their unique buying behavior works.\n\nSocial Media Statistics FAQ\n\nWhat is the most used social media platform?\n\nThe most-used social media platform is Facebook with over 3 billion users. Facebook is followed by YouTube (2.94 billion users), WhatsApp and Instagram (tied at 2 billion users).\n\nIs social media use increasing?\n\nSocial media use is increasing year-over-year, albeit slowly. However, due to the saturation of use, this slow growth isn’t surprising.\n\nIs social media marketing still effective?\n\nYes! There are over 5 billion social media user identities, meaning 62.3% of the population has created at least one social media account. That’s a massive potential reach. As long as you create the right strategy and target the right people, you should see success with social media marketing.\n\nAdditional resources for Social Media Statistics\n\nCategories\n\nWebinar\n\nFrom Pins to Leads: How Pictures Turn into Profit\n\nCategories\n\nSocial Media Analytics\n\nSocial Media Strategy\n\n40 Twitter (X) stats to know in marketing in 2024\n\nPublished on May 22, 2024 • Reading time 9 minutes\n\nCategories\n\nPinterest\n\nSocial Media Publishing\n\n24 must-know Pinterest stats for marketers in 2024\n\nPublished on March 27, 2024 • Reading time 7 minutes\n\nCategories\n\nSocial Media Content\n\nVideo\n\n50+ Social Media Video Marketing Statistics for 2024\n\nPublished on March 26, 2024 • Reading time 8 minutes\n\nCategories\n\nSocial Media Trends\n\nYouTube\n\n25 YouTube stats marketers should know in 2024 [Updated]\n\nPublished on March 20, 2024 • Reading time 7 minutes\n\nCategories\n\nFacebook\n\nSocial Media Trends\n\n24 Facebook statistics marketers should know in 2024\n\nPublished on March 19, 2024 • Reading time 8 minutes\n\nCategories\n\nSocial Media Strategy\n\nSocial Media Trends\n\n27 TikTok statistics marketers need to know in 2024\n\nPublished on February 20, 2024 • Reading time 7 minutes\n\nCategories\n\nSocial Media Trends\n\n50+ Must-know social media marketing statistics for 2024\n\nPublished on February 8, 2024 • Reading time 8 minutes\n\nCategories\n\nLinkedIn\n\nSocial Media Trends\n\nLinkedIn statistics for marketers in 2024\n\nPublished on February 28, 2023 • Reading time 10 minutes\n\nCategories\n\nSocial Media Strategy\n\n5 stats brands need to know to engage Irish & UK consumers\n\nPublished on July 18, 2019 • Reading time 4 minutes\n\nCategories\n\nData Report\n\nLeveling Up\n\nFrom conversation to connection: how brands can turn Likes into action\n\nCategories\n\nSocial Media Engagement\n\nSocial Media Strategy\n\n9 stats social media marketers need to show their bosses ASAP\n\nPublished on May 7, 2019 • Reading time 8 minutes",
      "# [11 social media trends you need to know in 2024 by Carly Hill on 2024-02-01](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-trends/)\nYou don’t need to be a fortune teller to guess which social media trends are poised to take off in 2024. All you need is data.\n\nCombining performance and consumer preference data can create a vivid picture of the year ahead. We’re not talking about which TikTok sounds will blow up in a few months. We’re talking about what’s driving audience behavioral patterns and where your brand fits in the mix.\n\nIn this article, learn about current trends in social media driving the future of social, based on input from social media experts and the data behind the social space.\n\nVideo is king…but with a long-form twist\n\nPlayful content is the new “brand personality”\n\nThe expansion of social commerce remains a trend to watch—and use\n\nSEO is important for social channels too—not just your site\n\nBehind-the-scenes content and reimagined transparency\n\nAuthentic content resonates across platforms\n\nThe evolution of social teams and titles\n\nThe boom of the creator and influencer economy\n\nPersonalized customer care is a consumer preference\n\nMarketing and customer care teams use AI regularly…and monitor it closely\n\nSocial data is key—beyond the marketing team\n\nTrend 1: Video is king…but with a long-form twist\n\nThe popularity of video, specifically short-form video, is bound to end up on a social media trends list every year.\n\nWe already know short-form video is one of the best ways to connect with your audience and reach new followers. In fact, most consumers say it’s the most engaging type of in-feed content.\n\nBut, plot twist: long-form video has seen a resurgence worth noting.\n\nTikTok has been pushing longer videos—starting with one-minute videos, then 10 and most recently, it started testing 30-minute uploads. It’s even starting to push horizontal videos a la YouTube.\n\nAnd with the platform reporting that users spend over half of their time on TikTok watching videos that are a minute or longer, these long-form tests have reason behind them.\n\nBrand takeaway: You still need short-form video as part of your day-to-day social media strategy. But think about how you can bring long-form storytelling into your content.\n\nTrend 2: Playful content is the new “brand personality”\n\nThe “edgy” brand voice is taking a back seat to a new brand trend: experimenting with playful content.\n\nBrands have consistently found creative ways to tap into meme culture and the voice of the Internet in a way that fits their voice. And we’ve seen more brands experimenting with their voice and visual content to do so.\n\nTake LinkedIn’s Threads, which have a human voice and cover topics that range from relatable and hilarious, to inspirational and endearing.\n\nAnd we love the way Auntie Anne’s pretzels has create a strategic, branded social media meme strategy. They create content that riffs on Internet culture, memes and trends while still staying true to their brand colors, tone and image.\n\nBrand takeaway: Think about how your brand can get playful on social media. You don’t have to do this in a way that breaks your brand’s voice and tone. What trends and meme formats could you adapt to fit your brand’s content?\n\nTrend 3: The expansion of social commerce remains a trend to watch—and use\n\nWe’ve all seen the #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt trend…or bought something after seeing it on TikTok or another social platform ourselves.\n\nBut this is more than a fleeting trend—social commerce is a continuing trend to watch and consider for your strategy. And platforms like TikTok are pushing for it. TikTok Shop officially launched in the US in late 2023. And they’re already testing ways to make that in-app shopping even easier.\n\nWe talked to Social Strategy Director at Mekanism, Jeff MacDonald, about current social trends to watch. And this is one that he flagged. As he puts it, live streaming and interactive shopping experiences are only expected to expand, so this trend is likely here to stay. “Live shopping events, combining entertainment with instant purchasing options, offer an engaging way for brands to connect with consumers. This year will be a test to see if North American audiences will adopt live commerce streams like other audiences have.”\n\nBrand takeaway: If you haven’t experimented with selling on social, now is a great time to test this out. There’s an eager, ready-to-buy audience on social. Give them another way to buy—look into whether opening up shop on TikTok, Facebook or Instagram is right for your brand.\n\nTrend 4: SEO is important for social channels too—not just your site\n\nRecently, I did research on a few places I want to travel and hike this coming summer. I didn’t turn to Google—I searched location hashtags on Instagram.\n\nDon’t underestimate the power of social media platforms as search engines. In 2022, nearly 40% of Gen Z preferred TikTok over Google for searching for information.\n\nThis makes optimizing your content for discoverability—both in feed and via search—more important than ever before.\n\nBrand takeaway: Just as you would optimize an article on your blog or a page on your site for SEO, take an optimized approach to your social content. Optimize your posts and profile for maximum discoverability by using the right keywords in your caption, the right hashtags and relevant keywords within your alt text, too.\n\nTrend 5: Behind-the-scenes content and reimagined transparency\n\nThe rising audience desire for authentic content lends itself to the need for brands to be more transparent about their business practices on social.\n\nBut there’s been an interesting shift. A few years ago, we couldn’t talk about trends in social media without covering the importance of brands speaking up—or getting called out. But in 2023, only a quarter of consumers polled in the Index said the most memorable brands on social spoke out about causes and news aligned with their values.\n\nThe Index also found the second biggest thing consumers don’t see enough of from brands on social media is transparency about business practices and values.\n\nI take this to mean that while brands speaking out used to set them apart, now it’s a regular expectation that brands demonstrate transparency and their values as a regular practice. We talked to Paula Perez, Social Engagement & Community Growth Specialist at Oatly, about current social trends. And as Perez puts it, “Consumers are more interested than ever in labor practices, diversity, investor relations, supply chain, company leadership, and environmental responsibility.”\n\nFor example, shoe brand Nisolo regularly creates and posts sustainability “report cards” for their products.\n\nBrand takeaway: Look for opportunities to provide more transparency about your business, products and practices. You can start as simple as creating behind-the-scenes content of your office, products being made, the people behind your products and your sustainability values. Make sure you have action or proof to back up your statements.\n\nAnd if questions do arise that your brand should address, use the right tools to stay proactive. Social listening will help you identify rising conversation topics early, enabling you to understand and get ahead of an issue, and identify the changes you need to make.\n\nTrend 6: Authentic content resonates across platforms\n\nAuthentic, non-promotional content is the number one thing consumers say they don’t see enough of from brands on social, according to The Sprout Social Index™. We’ve seen the way creator culture has skyrocketed in popularity—and brands featuring authentic voices, from creators to employees, shine against those that don’t.\n\nAnd it’s crucial for brands to recognize that this trend is here to stay—it’s the new era of social media.\n\nWe talked to Flywire Social Media Manager Sam Mackowitz, who believes AI is only driving this desire for more authenticity. “I think people will be yearning for authentic experiences on social media. Don’t get me wrong, AI is fantastic and can help us get places faster, but…that personal aspect is so important and will continue to be in 2024.”\n\nBrand takeaway: Besides tapping into creators, create more authentic owned content, too. As Mackowitz explains, “At Flywire, the content that performs the best for us is always when it’s showcasing our employees. We’ve had great success showcasing the people behind the payments! Authenticity will soar in 2024.”\n\nThink: playful posts and featuring fellow employees in video content who aren’t camera shy, or a “meet the team” series. Get creative!\n\nAn employee advocacy strategy is a stellar way to promote your brand authentically. Using a platform like Employee Advocacy by Sprout Social makes it easier for your employees to discover content and copy suggestions you curate for them to share.\n\nTrend 7: The evolution of social teams and titles\n\nIs your social team structure based on networks? Then you’re not alone—according to the Index, 64% of social teams are aligned to specific social platforms or networks.\n\nBut the reality is, your team structure is constantly running the risk of becoming outdated. As social media evolves, so do the teams and the skills needed to run it successfully. And the emergence of new platforms, like Threads, always brings back the same question: whose responsibility is a new platform when you’re divided by network?\n\nNew social media jobs and titles are emerging and evolving rapidly. We talked to Gabby Grahek, Strategic Services Consultant at Sprout and a social media thought leader, about current social trends. “I’m hoping and praying for social specialties on social teams. With organizations continuing to experiment with social, build a budget for these teams and elevate their maturity levels when you can.”\n\nBrand takeaway: Gabby thinks “we’ll see niche social professions develop on corporate teams.” Evaluate your current team structure and identify gaps. This is a great opportunity to take additional ownership over your career path and pitch a new role that fits your skillset. Or, make the case to your manager that you need more headcount to accommodate a new role.\n\nTrend 8: The boom of the creator and influencer economy\n\nToday, it’s the creator and influencer’s world—we’re just posting in it.\n\nIn the era of authenticity, creators and influencers lend an authentic, human voice and experience to the social scroll. And their place on brand accounts is only going to become more important to connecting with audiences. In fact, in a Q3 Sprout Pulse Survey of 307 US-based marketers, 8 in 10 social marketers describe influencer marketing as essential to their social strategies.\n\nAs Jeff MacDonald mentioned, “The continued dominance of TikTok underscores the shift towards more authentic, unfiltered content. This trend is likely to grow, with users gravitating towards content that feels genuine and relatable. Brands will increasingly leverage creators and influencers who can craft compelling stories and connect with audiences on a personal level.”\n\nBrand takeaway: The rise of creators and influencers and the authentic voice they provide will likely remain on the list of social media trends for years to come. So now is the time to kick off your creator and influencer marketing partnerships and program, if you haven’t already.\n\nAs Jeff put it, “Authenticity in content not only enhances engagement but also fosters trust and loyalty among consumers. This trend is very much in line with the human-centric approach to social media, where human creativity and connection are pivotal in crafting brand messages.”\n\nConsider adopting a dedicated creator and influencer management platform, which over half of brands have done according to a Q3 Sprout Pulse Survey. Platforms like Tagger by Sprout Social make managing your influencer partnerships and their impact easier.\n\nTrend 9: Personalized customer care is a consumer preference\n\nThe expectations for social media customer service have only gone up. Consumers no longer just want fast responses—70% of them expect personalized responses to their customer service needs, according to the Index.\n\nAnd 76% of consumers notice and appreciate when companies prioritize customer support—so companies who don’t do so inevitably fall behind.\n\nBrand takeaway: Stay up to date with customer service trends. Analyze your role in social customer care: how responsive are you being, and what can you do to scale your efforts?\n\nSome 75% of businesses in the Index say that social customer care will be shared to some degree by marketing and customer service teams. If this is also the case for you, remember that solid customer care is about empowering all teams involved to collaborate and communicate. Ensure that both teams are aligned on social voice and tone, response best practices, canned response use, chat bot updates and more.\n\nFeatures like Sprout’s Case Management enable teams to seamlessly work together to resolve customer issues, while integrations with platforms like Zendesk and Salesforce enable agents and social team members alike to get more context behind customer interactions, making personalization much easier.\n\nTrend 10: Marketing and customer care teams use AI regularly…and monitor it closely\n\nThe use of AI to streamline workflows remains one of the current social media trends that will stretch into this year—and beyond.\n\nAccording to The 2023 Social Index™, over 80% of marketers have already seen the positive impact of AI on their work. You yourself may be in that group. And beyond scaling content creation and customer care responses, AI will likely play an even larger role as a marketing and customer care tool.\n\nAs Jeff MacDonald tells us, “In 2024, we can expect a deeper integration of AI in personalizing user experiences. AI can analyze user data to provide highly tailored content recommendations, enhance customer service with more responsive chatbots, and drive more effective targeted advertising. This trend aligns with the increasing efficiency in content production, as AI tools become more adept at understanding and replicating human-like interactions and creativity.”\n\nBut this year, we forecast that this trend will look a little different. While there’s been a sustained use in AI, we’ve also seen a trend of increased conversations around AI ethics and using it safely.\n\nAs Gabby Grahek puts it, “Now that the shock of AI availability is wearing off, I expect companies that have been hesitant to adopt AI tools will develop (strict) adherence and governance policies to start taking advantage of the efficiencies available from the use of AI.”\n\nBrand takeaway: Join the marketers who are using AI to scale their content creation and customer care efforts. But always use it carefully and ethically—create an AI use policy to safeguard your brand and team.\n\nTrend 11: Social data is key—beyond the marketing team\n\nOne of the biggest social media myths is that social data is only relevant to social or marketing. On the contrary—social media data has the power to inform every area and team of your organization and improve your entire business, from product, to customer support to PR.\n\nAccording to the Index, 76% of marketers agree that their team’s social insights inform other departments. And this trend is here to stay. Companies that don’t use social to inform their wider business will undoubtedly fall behind.\n\nNot to mention, getting deep into the data is one of the best ways to identify trends in social media in your owned content.\n\nAs social teams become more sophisticated, so will their use of data beyond their team…as long as social teams know how to communicate that data with other departments.\n\nBrand takeaway: You already know how valuable social data is—this year, demonstrate this to other teams. Download our 2024 Social Media Toolkit for six resources that will help you streamline your strategy and share its impact.\n\nUse these social media trends to keep your strategy one step ahead\n\nWe can’t always know when a new platform, content format or trending TikTok sound will bubble up. In fact, they usually surprise us in a drop-everything-and-film-this-content way.\n\nBut we can look at the larger social media marketing trends now and use them to build a stronger strategy that sets us up for success. And that creates a solid foundation that not even the advent of a new platform can shake. (Well, maybe a little.)",
      "# [Report Highlights the Best Times to Post to Social Platforms in 2024 by Andrew Hutchinson on 2024-05-21](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/report-highlights-best-times-post-social-platforms-in-2024/716801/)\nOkay, first, a point of clarification: There are no universal best times to post on social media for every single brand and every business.\n\nEach brand’s audience is different, their behaviors and interests are not the same, and as such, there’s no one-size-fits-all, prescriptive approach that’ll ensure that you get the best results every time that you post.\n\nThat said, “best times to post” guides can be helpful, in both highlighting broader trends in engagement, and prompting you to think about when you might want to start your experiments, in order to find your ideal posting cadence.\n\nYou might be posting at 4pm, when 7am would be better, and reports like this can get you thinking about why that might be, what your audience is seeking, and how your approach could be cut to fit.\n\nSo, yes, I know, before you reply and comment, that these reports are not 100% correct. I know, and Sprout Social knows too, but there are still benefits to this data, which could help in your planning.\n\nSprout’s latest best times to post overview looks at the times where each social app is seeing the most engagement, based on overall trends.\n\nHere’s a look at the latest data, as it relates to the top social apps, starting with Facebook.\n\nAccording to Sprout’s data, the best times to post on Facebook are weekdays between 9am and midday, while Sundays are the worst days to post.\n\nAs you can see in the above chart, weekday mornings see more activity, with the 5pm to 6pm period, when people are making their way home, seeing another surge.\n\nThat’s pretty much the same as what Sprout Social found last year for FB, and while it may seem counterintuitive to be posting early in the workday, that, seemingly, is when more people are logging on and interacting.\n\nAlso worth noting Sprout’s specific description of its methodology here:\n\n“We worked closely with Sprout’s Data Science team to review findings and trends in social media usage over the past year from Sprout Social’s more than 34,000 customers and understand when their content was most and least frequently engaged with, broken out by platform and industry.”\n\nSo it’s based on engagement with posts that came via Sprout Social, not on posting times.\n\nOn Instagram, Sprout says that weekdays between 9am and 2pm are best, with less engagement on Friday and weekends.\n\nFor LinkedIn, meanwhile, company pages see the most engagement on Tuesdays and Wednesdays between 10am and 12pm.\n\nPinterest is also included, with the best time to Pin being Tuesdays to Fridays at 1am.\n\nYes, 1am. Why so early?\n\nAccording to Sprout:\n\n“It may be a combination of when users are struck with inspiration and the Pinterest algorithm that affects engagement times.”\n\nIn other words, it’s not really clear, but more engagement appears to be happening in the early hours in the app.\n\nPosting on TikTok works best in the afternoon, from 2pm to 6pm on weekdays.\n\nAs you can see, there are also strong engagement trends between 9am and 11am on Wednesday and Thursday, with other days seeing less engagement.\n\nFinally, on X, weekdays between 9am and 3pm are best.\n\nAgain, these are just guides, and while they are based on actual engagement rates, individual results will vary. You can use overviews like this to help in your experiments, as you look for the best times to post for your business and audience, and they may help to get you thinking about your strategy, and what could be worth trying out.",
      "# [Everything You Need to Know About Social Media Algorithms by Dorcas Adisa on 2023-10-30](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-algorithms/)\nSocial media algorithms can be a powerful ally in growing one’s online audience. Think of it as a virtual matchmaker designed to match users with content that suits their interests. Just as matchmakers strive to make meaningful connections, algorithms analyze user behavior, interactions and interests to understand their content preferences and deliver personalized content.\n\nAs algorithms continuously evolve and become more complex, social media marketers must embrace change, adapt swiftly and navigate these algorithmic shifts. The best strategy is to stay updated on trends and optimize your social strategy to maximize engagement.\n\nThis guide covers everything about social media algorithms, including important factors to watch out for and how to adapt your social media marketing strategies accordingly.\n\nWhat is a social media algorithm?\n\nWhy are social media algorithms important?\n\nUnderstanding how social media algorithms work\n\nSocial media algorithms by platform\n\n10 Tips for staying ahead of the algorithm and optimizing your content\n\nAI’s role in social media algorithms\n\nStart mastering the algorithm\n\nSocial Media Algorithm FAQs\n\nWhat is a social media algorithm?\n\nAn algorithm is a series of instructions designed to solve specific problems, perform tasks or make decisions. In computer programming, algorithms direct the computer’s actions, such as sorting elements, locating data or identifying objects.\n\nIn social media, algorithms are rules, signals and data that govern the platform’s operation. These algorithms determine how content is filtered, ranked, selected and recommended to users. In some ways, algorithms influence our choices and what we see on social media.\n\nWhy are social media algorithms important?\n\nEvery social media platform comprises a mix of users with different preferences. Without a filtering system, users must navigate through a flood of posts, which can be overwhelming.\n\nThis is where algorithms come into play. Social media platforms employ sophisticated algorithms as intelligent guides, carefully sorting and matching content to audiences with similar preferences. Understanding the ins and outs of algorithms and why they are important is essential for any social media marketing strategy:\n\nFilter out the content noise\n\nWhen a new TikTok video or a Facebook post is published, it joins millions of other content pieces online. Algorithms function as librarians, sorting and connecting users with their preferences. This prevents overwhelming users with endless content and helps them find what they like faster. Algorithms enable users to uncover valuable posts, connect with like-minded individuals and explore their interests.\n\nShow users more of what they’re interested in\n\nSocial media platforms use sophisticated algorithms to prolong user engagement. These algorithms control content visibility, sequence and recommendations based on user data like actions, behaviors and interests. For instance, if you interact with gadget-related posts, you’ll see more of such content. This personalization improves user engagement and in turn, creates a positive user experience.\n\nPersonalize user experience\n\nToday, users have greater control over their content experience. Algorithms leverage data to personalize content recommendations. On platforms like Instagram, you can customize your feed by hiding posts, filtering comments, or selecting “Not interested” to curate your content.\n\nMaximize organic reach\n\nUnderstanding social media algorithms can boost your online social presence. As more users find your content, the algorithm becomes better at targeting users with similar interests. Creators and marketers can optimize their content for algorithms to leverage its distribution potential. When a post gains high engagement, the algorithm promotes it to a wider audience.\n\nUnderstanding how social media algorithms work\n\nUnderstanding how social media algorithms work is like unraveling the intricate threads that govern the digital tapestry of user experiences. These algorithms, like invisible guides, determine the content on our feeds. Let’s explore how social media algorithms function and how social teams can take advantage of it.\n\nAlgorithms search for relevant and valuable content\n\nAlgorithmic-driven content curation systems such as the Facebook News Feed and Instagram Feed monitor user behavior, interests and actions to recommend relevant content. For instance, if you engage with basketball content, you’ll likely see more of it.\n\nThese algorithms aim to refine content suggestions by adapting and learning from user interactions, ensuring content remains relevant.\n\nSignals and important factors social algorithms consider\n\nAlgorithms collect user signals to match them with relevant content. Key signals include:\n\nUser engagement: Likes, shares and comments indicate that users find the content interesting and relevant.\n\nRelevance: Keywords and hashtags give content context and improve its visibility.\n\nTiming and frequency: Posting consistently and at the right time when your audience is active can boost visibility.\n\nRecency: Newer posts are prioritized over older ones.\n\nUser interactions: Accounts followed, interactions and click-through rates on links signals relevance and content quality.\n\nProfile authority: Follower count, consistency and engagement impact organic reach.\n\nLocation: Algorithms take into account the location and demographics of users when curating content. Content may be promoted to users in similar locations.\n\nContent type: Different content types, like videos, images and text, are treated based on user interaction. Many platforms favor videos because they’re more engaging.\n\nVirality: Content gaining popularity and shares signals relevance to the algorithm.\n\nWatch time: This is the duration users spends watching videos (IG Reel, YouTube Shorts)\n\nSocial media algorithm example\n\nIf you use any social media platforms, there’s a huge chance that you’ve come in contact with the algorithm in play. Here are some examples you might have missed.\n\nTwitter shows content based on the keywords users follow. For example, I follow the “SEO” keyword, and X (formerly known as Twitter) recommends posts with the keyword on my Explore page.\n\nLinkedIn’s algorithm shows content that my 1st-degree connections are engaging with. In this post, for example, over 313 of my 1st-degree connections follow this account, so LinkedIn prioritizes the sponsored post on my Feed.\n\nLinkedIn suggests content for users with similar keywords. I love reading about social media and content marketing on LinkedIn, so it’s no surprise they push this content type my way.\n\nTwitter suggests accounts to follow based on the content they post and what you’ve liked.\n\nSocial media algorithms by platform\n\nEvery social media platform has its unique algorithm for content curation and display. These platforms look for specific ranking signals to discern user preferences. Let’s explore some social media platforms and their platform-specific rank signals to keep in mind.\n\nTwitter algorithm\n\nThe Twitter algorithm is an AI-powered algorithm designed to curate content based on the user’s interests, preferences and past interactions rather than chronologically. According to Twitter, their algorithm looks through about 500 million daily Tweets to display only relevant ones on your timeline.\n\nIn 2023, the updated Twitter algorithm considers:\n\nLocation and language: Twitter shows you content based on your location, especially in their “Trends for You” section.\n\nUser interactions: Content is recommended based on your activity, including who you follow and interact with.\n\nEngagement level: Tweet popularity is determined by user engagement metrics such as likes, Retweets and replies.\n\nRelevancy: The relevance of a Tweet is based on the keywords used, the user’s interests and previous interactions.\n\nRecency: Recent Tweets hold importance, especially in the “Trending Topics” and “What’s Happening” sections.\n\nProfile Reputation Score: Active profiles engaging with others gain higher visibility; Twitter also uses TweetCred, a PageRank algorithm, to rate a profile’s credibility based on its followers, past activities, safety status and device usage.\n\nSimilar accounts: Profiles are categorized based on the niche or topic discussed.\n\nFacebook algorithm\n\nWith over 2 billion active users, Facebook is the largest social media platform yet. To moderate content on the platform, Facebook employs several algorithms to determine what content users will find interesting. The updated algorithm considers:\n\nTiming: Facebook’s algorithm prioritizes timing as a key signal for ranking content in user’s feeds.\n\nDemographics: The user’s location, language and gender can help predict their content preferences.\n\nAccount credibility: The algorithm ranks accounts with credibility, a strong following, and engaging content.\n\nContent type: Facebook’s algorithm prioritizes the type of posts users engage with most. So, users who watch more videos will get more video content.\n\nRelevance: Posts with similar keywords or hashtags are recommended to users with shared interests.\n\nEngagement levels: High engagement, including comments, shares and likes, indicates quality content and since Facebook is all about creating meaningful posts, it ranks it higher.\n\nFacebook connections: Content from the accounts you follow is prioritized over those you don’t follow.\n\nFacebook’s algorithm combines these signals to give the post a relevancy score, which predicts how likely a user is to interact with a post.\n\nInstagram algorithm\n\nInstagram’s algorithm is one of the most diverse social media platforms. According to Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri, Instagram is divided into 5 sections: Feed, Stories, Explore, Reels, Search. Each section uses algorithms, classifiers and processes to tailor content recommendations based on user behavior.\n\nInstagram Feed\n\nYour Instagram feed is a mix of content from accounts you follow, similar profiles you’re likely to enjoy and personalized ads. In the feed, posts are ranked based on several signals:\n\nPost recency: Recent posts from accounts take priority, appearing before older ones.\n\nPeople you follow: Posts from those you follow appear organically on your feed. For creators, this means having more followers increases your visibility.\n\nUser activity: Posts you’ve liked, shared, saved or commented on convey your content preferences.\n\nContent type: Users who prefer photos will see more photos. The same goes for videos and carousels.\n\n[IMAGE]\n\nPost information: Posts with many likes, shares, comments and saves signal relevance to users with similar interests or locations.\n\nInteraction history: Your interactions with an account’s posts and frequency influence the appearance of their content in your feed.\n\nInstagram Stories\n\nStories is an in-app feature that allows users to post photos or videos that disappear after 24 hours. Here’s what it looks like:\n\nThe ranking factors for stories are quite similar to those of the IG Feed. Stories use engagement signals such as:\n\nViewing history: Frequently viewing an account’s stories would result in its prioritization.\n\nEngagement history: Liking or responding to stories is an engagement metric that impacts story rankings.\n\nCloseness: The algorithm considers your relationship with the story’s creator, including mutual follows, shared locations, and DM interactions.\n\nInstagram Explore\n\nExplore simplifies the discovery of new posts without needing active search. Here’s what it looks like on Instagram:\n\nThe grid comprises content recommendations from accounts you don’t follow but Instagram believes you might enjoy. Signals Instagram considers include:\n\nUser’s past interaction: Content is ranked based on previous engagements with posts.\n\nPost popularity: The number of likes, comments, shares, and saves influences visibility.\n\nUser’s explore activity: history of a user’s interaction on the Explore page, including liked posts and similar content.\n\nAccount information: the frequency of interaction with the account in the past few weeks.\n\nInstagram Reels\n\nReels are designed for users to explore new content from accounts they don’t follow, similar to Explore. Key signals for Reels content include:\n\nUser’s activity: Recent interactions with Reels, such as likes, saves, shares, comments, and engagement.\n\nInteraction history: Your interaction history with accounts, even if you don’t follow them.\n\nRelevance: The content’s relevance is determined by popularity signals like likes, saves, and comments.\n\nAccount information: An account’s popularity, including follower count and engagement level, informs content recommendation.\n\nTikTok algorithm\n\nTikTok’s algorithm is a recommendation system designed to curate the For You Feed for each user considering the following signals:\n\nUser interactions: Your likes, views, shares, comments, searches, and interactions with accounts shape your feed.\n\nAccounts you follow or suggested for you\n\nLocation: Recent and popular content in your region impacts your feed.\n\nVideo details: TikTok uses video quality, captions, sounds or hashtags to recommend content.\n\nDevice and account settings: This includes the language, device type and country.\n\nWatch time: The number of replays and completed videos influences your feed.\n\nYouTube algorithm\n\nYouTube’s algorithm considers many signals to rank videos on its homepage, including:\n\nVideo performance: YouTube video performance is measured in terms of engagement metrics such as likes, shares and comments.\n\nClick-through rate: YouTube’s algorithm assesses the likelihood of user interaction with a video to recommend it to other users.\n\nWatch time and retention: Videos with longer watch time indicate quality content that retains viewer attention.\n\nRecency: Newer videos are promoted to subscribers who interact with the channel.\n\nUser watch history and actions: Video watch time and post-interaction actions, like liking and commenting, signal relevance to the algorithm.\n\nSearch history: What has the user searched for? Is it a recurring search?\n\nDemographics and location: Videos uploaded by creators in a particular location are pushed to local viewers before broader promotion.\n\nLinkedIn algorithm\n\nLinkedIn’s algorithm uses several ranking signals that contribute to the success of a post on the platform. Here are some to watch out for:\n\nQuality over quantity: LinkedIn’s algorithm filters posts into three categories: spam, low-quality and high-quality.\n\nRelevance: The algorithm assesses post relevance based on keywords, hashtags, and comments.\n\nEngagement probability: LinkedIn uses machine learning models to predict post engagement, especially within the first hour.\n\nPersonal connections: LinkedIn’s algorithm prioritizes posts from your 1st-degree connections and those you engage with.\n\nConsistency: The algorithm rewards pages that post regularly with increased visibility.\n\nCredibility: Author expertise, insightful content and meaningful comments enhance post ranking.\n\nRecency: Recent posts hold significance for LinkedIn’s algorithm.\n\nContent type: The algorithm loves short-form videos and well-structured long-form content.\n\nPinterest algorithm\n\nThe Pinterest algorithm ranks content using key ranking signals such as:\n\nTopic relevance: Keywords, hashtags, and user interactions determine content relevance to users.\n\nPin quality: Your pin’s level of engagement, such as likes, saves and comments defines pin quality.\n\nDomain quality: Website safety and visitor engagement impact Pinterest rankings. If visitors feel safe on your website, Pinterest ranks your content highly.\n\nAccount quality: Pinterest assesses your account credibility and posting consistency as a ranking signal. If you’re considering Pinterest marketing, then ensure your account is on the good side.\n\nRecency: The algorithm considers how recently a pin was published and how recently it was updated.\n\nReddit algorithm\n\nReddit’s algorithm is designed to rank content based on what’s Hot and Best, guided by key signals like:\n\nThe number of upvotes, downvotes and total votes it gets. Reddit uses votes as a signal to determine post relevance.\n\nRecent posts gain more traction and visibility. If you’re marketing on Reddit, ensure you consistently post valuable content.\n\nThe types of comments it gets. For example, a comment with nine up-votes and two down-votes will rank higher than a comment with one-up votes and no-down votes.\n\nTumblr algorithm\n\nIf you use Tumblr for marketing, here are some signals to watch out for:\n\nUser interaction: Tumblr considers likes, reblogs, comments and follows to expand content reach to a broader audience.\n\nPost content: The algorithm uses tags, text, images and multimedia to understand the post context and make recommendations.\n\nPost timing: Newer posts receive higher visibility and are prioritized over older ones.\n\nUser preference: Past user interactions, content engagement and followed blogs influence content recommendations.\n\n10 tips for staying ahead of the algorithm and optimizing your content\n\nTo stay ahead of the algorithm and leverage its potential for business growth, you must understand how it works and its governing rules. Through trial and error, we’ve learned several ever-green principles to help you stay ahead of the algorithm.\n\n1. Ask questions and encourage comments from your audience\n\nSocial media algorithms favor highly engaging content with tons of comments, shares and likes. More engagement equals better chances of going viral. To encourage comments, ask questions that resonate with your audience. Ask their take on trending topics or go bold with thought-provoking inquiries to spark conversations.\n\nWhile a question-based CTA is great for encouraging conversations, doing it right is what matters. Avoid controversial or offensive questions to foster positive discussion.\n\n2. Tag other accounts in your posts\n\nTagging on social media involves mentioning someone by their username (or handle) in a post, comment or image, creating a clickable link to their profile. For example, a fashion curation account on Instagram may post several looks and tag the content creators or designers.\n\nTagging accounts in your posts boosts collaboration, brand exposure and visibility. On platforms like Instagram, tagging someone in a picture gets it featured in their “Photos of You” section, expanding your reach to their followers.\n\nIt’s good practice to reach out to accounts you tag and explain why before doing so. Ensure you have an established relationship with the account and, more importantly, that the post is relevant to the audience.\n\n3. Tack on the right hashtags and keywords\n\nHashtags categorize posts and boost post discoverability to a wider audience.\n\nUse hashtags strategically; don’t go overboard. Stick to 3-5 hashtags to avoid overwhelming your audience and hurting visibility. Also, skip overly saturated hashtags and opt for focused ones. For example, rather than using hashtags like #InteriorDesign with 175M posts on Instagram, substitute for a smaller hashtag like #InteriorDesignTrends with 484,000 posts.\n\nTo find hashtags, use the autocomplete function on the social media platform you’re posting on. A better way is to use a social media management tool like Sprout Social. With Sprout, you can use social listening to monitor trending hashtags and select the best ones for your brand based on performance, sentiment and demographics.\n\n4. Optimize your post timing to encourage engagement\n\nWhen you post matters as much as what you post. Timing is a key ranking signal for many algorithms to rank a post. This means that a high-quality post, created for a defined audience, can underperform if posted at the wrong time.\n\nThe best posting times vary based on your audience, industry and platform, but generally, aim to post when your audience is online for maximum visibility and interaction. In our research, we found that the best time to post on social media generally is between 9 a.m. to noon.\n\nUsing Sprout’s ViralPost® takes out the guesswork about the best time to post for your industry. ViralPost analyzes your individual audience data and suggests optimal timing for each social platform you use.\n\n5. Figure out your publishing frequency\n\nThere’s no universal answer to how often you should post on social media. It depends on several factors, but one thing is certain: Growing on social media requires consistency. Instagram’s algorithm, for example, prioritizes the recency of a post as a key signal for ranking content.\n\nA personal philosophy is to post only when the content is relevant to avoid overwhelming your followers. Use a social media calendar to plan your content and schedule your posts to stay organized. Sprout Social gives you the flexibility of planning and streamlining your workflow without much hassle.\n\n6. Publish more video content across all networks\n\nVideo outperforms text-based content on social media platforms because it’s easier to understand, conveys messages quickly and adds a personal touch.\n\nWhen creating a social media video marketing strategy, creativity is key. Share behind-the-footage of your product, create how-to videos or share an office tour with your audience—find your best mix of content. Make it exciting and engaging to watch, so your audience has a reason to stay.\n\nOptimize schedule, and promote your video using a management tool like Sprout. For example, Sprout’s YouTube publishing options let you fine-tune categories, playlists, privacy settings and thumbnails. Manage and schedule your posts conveniently from your social media calendar for optimal timing.\n\n7. Craft relevant and engaging captions\n\nOne principle that stands the test of algorithmic changes is creating content that’s highly relevant to your audience. Social media platforms prioritize engaging, high-quality content that elicits positive reactions.\n\nCreating engaging captions depends on your audience and the platform, which guides posting times and content choices. For example, while long-form captions work for LinkedIn’s professional audience, shorter captions work best on Instagram. It’s best to test and learn.\n\nStart your post with a strong hook. Aim to educate, entertain, promote or interact with your audience. Be concise, provide value and avoid unnecessary jargon. Conclude with a call-to-action (CTA) encouraging reader interaction.\n\nTest multiple content types—videos, text or images—to determine what resonates with your audience and track the social metrics (think: impressions, clicks and views) to identify top-performing posts.\n\n8. Experiment with different types of content (template)\n\nIf there’s one thing for certain, it’s that there is no absolute when it comes to what is successful on social media; it all depends on what works for your audience. Experiment with different types of content, like videos, photos or live streams, to see what resonates with your audience. In our recent Content Benchmark Report, we found that consumers found short-form videos the most engaging.\n\nRun A/B tests on your content types at different times and track the analytics for engagement using Sprout analytic and reporting tools. Once you find the right combination, replicate its success. Stay creative and remain open to exploring other content types.\n\n9. Measure performance\n\nDon’t forget to monitor your content’s performance. Define clear goals and KPIs aligned with your business objectives. Ensure your goals are specific, measurable, achievable and relevant to your business’s objectives.\n\nTrack common metrics like reach, impressions, engagements, likes, shares and mentions. Use Sprout’s analytics feature to track metrics in real-time and generate reports.\n\n10. Embrace new features\n\nEmbrace newly released features to showcase your creativity and adaptability. Platforms reward creators who experiment with their new features. They want more people to use these new features, so early adopters are often rewarded with higher visibility.\n\nAI’s role in social media algorithms\n\nThe fact is, without AI, social media wouldn’t exist in the first place. AI has played a significant role in developing and curating algorithms to learn about users and make deliberate decisions based on the collected data.\n\nHere are some ways AI plays a role in social media algorithms:\n\n1. Flagging of misinformation and fake news\n\nSocial media platforms use AI to detect fake news and filter out offensive, harmful and disrespectful content. For instance, Twitter uses machine-learning models, AI-driven algorithms, user reporting and human moderation teams to identify and flag misinformation. The algorithm analyzes the tweet content and account history to fact-check the accuracy of the information shared.\n\n2. Moderate content for user safety\n\nIt’s fair to say that social media can be unpleasant due to trolls who engage in offensive behavior, such as making hateful comments and, in worse situations, harassment.\n\nTo maintain quality discussions, platforms employ content moderation tools to identify suspicious posts and comments. For instance, Reddit uses machine learning models to spot suspicious comments, which are further reviewed by human moderators. Likewise, Facebook uses an AI tool to detect abuse and fraud in posts, images and videos, with human reviewers stepping in when needed.\n\n3. Personalize content delivery\n\nAI-driven algorithms segment users based on explicit (follows and likes) and implicit (video-watching time) details to personalize content recommendations. Users can select preferred keywords, follow hashtags or hide inappropriate words in their Feeds and DMs.\n\nUser data, including feedback, actions and behavior informs content recommendations and suggests related posts with similar keywords.\n\n4. Provide real-time analytics\n\nAI algorithms have the capacity to collect, process and analyze data as soon as it is generated. Platforms like Facebook, which records billions of daily users, use generative AI for rapid predictions, understanding user relationships and addressing security issues in real time.\n\nWhen users log into Facebook, the AI algorithm immediately tracks their in-app behavior, including user engagement, content performance and trending topics, to offer personalized recommendations.\n\nStart mastering the algorithms\n\nThe key to winning with algorithms is understanding how they work. Understand the best practices for satisfying the algorithm and you’ll be on your way to increasing your engagement and growing your audience base.\n\nIf you want to learn more about how businesses are harnessing social media for growth, read our report on The 2023 State of Social Media: AI & Data Take Center Stage.\n\nSocial Media Algorithm Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat are the downsides to social media algorithms?\n\nSocial media algorithms often favor big accounts with huge followings. As a result, smaller accounts may experience reduced organic reach.\n\nWhat is a social media algorithm?\n\nA social media algorithm is a set of rules, signals and data that governs how content is filtered, ranked and recommended to users on the platform.\n\nHow do you find the newest algorithm changes in social media?\n\nCheck official blogs, social channels and newsrooms of social channels. You should also follow industry experts and influencers for insights on new algorithm changes.\n\nWhat are the most common signals used by social media algorithms?\n\nThe most common signals are user engagement metrics, post frequency and timing, content quality, content relevance and other platform-specific criteria.",

As a Luminary, we must be extraordinary. To inspire our audience to look at their situation in a new way. To see social differently. We do that through taking risks, surprising and delighting, and stepping outside the norms of our industry when it comes to the way we deliver a message.\n\nWhat we don't mean by unexpected\n\nWe don't mean abrupt or unplanned. Our choices are never reckless or accidental. Everything we do is done with intention—always weighing the risks and possibilities.

Our breadth of experience is what gives us the unique position to be relatable and aspirational at once, and we should make the most of that.\n\nWe’re the authority that can speak to every level of professional. When we communicate, our audience feels like we’re a brand who “just gets it.” We connect with our readers through personal stories and industry specific examples. We make our readers feel seen by speaking directly to them with words that they use everyday.\n\nExamples\n\nTips for writing with relatability\n\nBe conversational\n\nUse familiar language and points to make a message memorable to users\n\nEvoke emotion\n\nGet deep into the wants and needs of customers. Talk about pain points, talk about motivations.\n\nAsk questions\n\nValidate customers’ point of view by asking questions and keeping them engaged\n\nWhat to avoid\n\nToo much self-deprecation undercuts your authority (see mastery)\n\nDon’t use conversational writing to drag a point on.

There aren’t specific content types where intentionality is a leading tone, it comes through in the confidence and the polish of everything we’ll create.",
      "# [What is influencer marketing: An influencer strategy guide for 2024 by Annette Chacko on 2024-06-06](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/influencer-marketing/)\nInfluencers are here to stay. According to a Q3 2023 Sprout Pulse Survey, more than 80% of marketers agree that influencers are essential to their overall social media strategy.\n\nBut the world of influencer marketing is constantly evolving.\n\nA decade ago, the influencer marketing arena was limited only to celebrities and a few dedicated bloggers, whereas now, social media influencers are abound across all social networks. Their followings may vary in size, but these influencers pack a punch. Their tight-knit communities foster authentic connections and influence purchase behaviors, leading to higher brand engagement and ultimately, sales.\n\nHowever, working with digital creators and influencers needs a well-planned and strategic approach. And this guide aims to help you navigate it. Read on for tips on how to build an effective influencer marketing strategy, what mistakes to avoid and how to find the right influencers for your brand.\n\nDownload the 2024 Influencer Marketing Benchmarks Report\n\nMeasure your campaigns against other industry players, set meaningful ROI expectations and craft influencer content audiences want.\n\nPublished on\n\nWhat is influencer marketing?\n\nInfluencer marketing is a social media marketing approach that uses endorsements and product mentions from influencers. These individuals have a dedicated social following and are viewed as experts within their niche.\n\nInfluencer marketing works because of the high trust social influencers have built with their following over time. Recommendations from these influencers serve as a form of social proof to your brand’s potential customers.\n\nTypes of influencers: By size and reach\n\nPartnering with an influencer with millions of followers might sound like a dream come true but they may not be the best fit for your brand.\n\nSome social media influencers have large, broad audiences spanning across several demographics. Others boast smaller but more targeted and engaged communities.\n\nKnowing what each type of influencer can offer you in terms of reach, range, cost and engagement is key to choosing the right ones for your brand.\n\nLet’s take a deeper look at the various types of influencers out there:\n\nMega or celebrity influencers\n\nThese influencers have a massive following of over 1 million and often include famous actors, musicians, athletes and other public figures. Their celebrity status allows them to captivate a diverse audience, making them ideal for large-scale brand awareness campaigns. Think: Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nMega influencers can give your brand unparalleled exposure, but partnering with them can be incredibly expensive. Plus, since their audience is often broad, their engagement rates may not be as high as influencers with smaller, more niche followings.\n\nHere are some businesses that might benefit from working with mega influencers:\n\nLarge enterprise corporations that have the budget and resources\n\nBrands targeting a broad audience with varying characteristics\n\nLuxury or high-end brands that want to create a sense of exclusivity\n\nMacro-influencers\n\nWith a following that typically ranges from 100,000 to 1 million, macro-influencers are established personalities within their respective niches.\n\nThese influencers have earned their reputation through consistent content creation and engagement over time, and are now thought leaders in their niche.\n\nMacro-influencers offer a more targeted approach compared to celebrities, as their followers usually share common interests. Collaborating with macro-influencers can provide your brand with substantial reach, but it may still be relatively costly depending on your budget.\n\nHere are some examples of brands that might work with macro-influencers:\n\nStartups seeking rapid exposure, growth and credibility (e.g., Canva)\n\nNonprofit organizations looking to raise funds and awareness\n\nHotels and airlines targeting a specific but large audience\n\nMicro-influencers\n\nWith 10,000 to 100,000 highly engaged followers, micro-influencers are the rising stars of influencer marketing. These influencers typically have a strong presence on specific platforms, like Instagram, YouTube and TikTok.\n\nMarketers love working with micro-influencers as they captivate a niche, passionate audience with their creative content, relatable recommendations and genuine interactions. They’re also more affordable than larger influencers.\n\nNano-influencers\n\nNano-influencers have between 1,000 to 10,000 followers. These influencers often have a strong connection with their audience, thanks to the close-knit community they’ve built and their personable content.\n\nWhile they offer a smaller reach, nano-influencers can be excellent partners for businesses who want to target specific communities and demographics without breaking the bank. In fact, per the latest Influencer Marketing Hub data, 44% of brands prefer to partner with nano influencers in 2024, compared to 39% in 2023.\n\nThere are many reasons for this, namely, since nano-influencers work on a small scale, they dedicate more time and effort to individual partnerships. This means more tailored content for your brand and personal relationships within niche communities. They are perfect for businesses such as:\n\nLocal businesses targeting specific communities, cities or regions\n\nSmall businesses with limited budgets that want to run cost-effective campaigns\n\nArtisan, home-based or speciality food businesses reaching a niche audience interested in their one-of-a-kind products\n\nWhy use influencer marketing?\n\nInfluencer marketing can be an incredibly powerful marketing tool for you, and brands are already using it to their advantage, as these influencer marketing examples show.\n\nAccording to The 2024 Influencer Marketing Report, almost half of all consumers (49%) make purchases at least once a month because of influencer posts; and almost all consumers (86%) make a purchase inspired by an influencer at least once a year. Not surprisingly, the influencer marketing industry is expected to grow to $24 billion in 2024 as indicated by the Influencer Marketing Hub's latest research.\n\nHere are more reasons why you should add influencers to your marketing mix.\n\nIncreased brand awareness\n\nCollaborating with an influencer draws a wider audience to your brand. By featuring your brand in their content, influencers introduce it to new audiences who may not have been familiar with it. Also, the trust influencers hold with their followers enhances your brand's reputation and credibility and boosts market awareness.\n\nPrecise audience targeting\n\nInfluencer marketing helps brands with precise audience targeting by connecting brands to influencers whose followers align with the brand's target demographic. This ensures their message reaches the right audience and is delivered from a perspective that resonates with the audience, making the campaign more effective.\n\nHigher conversions\n\nSocial proof is a powerful factor in the likelihood of making a purchase after seeing an influencer campaign, because it helps sway undecided consumers in your favor. Similarly, influencers often share interactive content such as giveaways, challenges and live sessions that drive engagement and prompt actions like making purchases or signing up for deals. They also share exclusive discount codes or special offers making it easy to track conversions directly linked to their promotion.\n\nBuilding trust and authenticity with your audience\n\nInfluencers build trust with their followers by sharing personal experiences and opinions that resonate with their audience, making them more relatable. They further increase their credibility by being open about brand partnerships and only promoting products they genuinely support.\n\nPlus, their seemingly unscripted content contrasts with traditional advertisements, making it sound authentic and spontaneous, which fosters personal connection with followers. This trust is further reinforced by how they respond to comments, making their audiences feel valued and heard, thus strengthening the bond. All this combined, helps influencers drive higher conversion rates for brands.\n\nHow to create an influencer marketing strategy in 5 steps\n\nWhile Instagram influencer marketing is a well-known strategy, other platforms like TikTok, Facebook, YouTube and Snapchat resonate increasingly well with different demographics.\n\nLike any marketing tactic, an influencer program takes thoughtful planning. Here are key factors to consider while developing your influencer marketing strategy.\n\n1. Find influencers and understand their payment structure\n\nFinding the right influencer for your brand is the first step to building a successful influencer marketing strategy. You must invest time in market research to understand your audience’s preferences and choose the right platform to engage them with an influencer collaboration.\n\nThis is especially important because each network caters to a specific audience. For example, beauty and fashion brands shine on Instagram and YouTube, while the video game industry dominates Twitch.\n\nHere are some factors to consider when searching for influencers:\n\nDoes the influencer already post about similar topics related to your service?\n\nAre they legit? Scroll through their feed and click through on posts. A poor engagement ratio to follower count and spam-like comments are signs of a fake account or fake followers.\n\nHave they worked with similar brands before? Depending on what type of influencer you’re looking for, a seasoned one will be able to show you a press kit that contains a portfolio of their work.\n\nSocial listening can assist you in identifying where people are discussing your industry and brand, and to find influential voices within your industry on each platform.\n\nSimilarly, focus on the type of influencers you want, and plan for their pricing. Whether it’s celebrities with massive followings or micro-influencers with less than 2,000 followers, do your due diligence because that will determine your budget.\n\nCompensation varies based on platform, influencer types and types of influencer collaborations, so think about the expected ROI of your social influencer marketing campaign. How will you measure the impact of influencer posts on your overall marketing goals? For instance, compare how you would budget for a video production firm creating an ad versus an influencer creating a video. Resources like this Instagram influencer rate map can help you estimate influencer costs based on audience size and industry.\n\n2. Set a budget and management strategy\n\nThe next step is to create an influencer marketing budget.\n\nUse an influencer marketing budgeting template to manage your expenses and strategically allocate resources to high-value partnerships. Be sure to account for the time needed to plan, execute and review your influencer program because, unlike automated ad strategies, influencers often juggle multiple partnerships, requiring a more hands-on approach from you.\n\nIf your budget allows, consider establishing an ambassador program to diversify and enrich your content. Similar to Fujifilm, which uses ambassadors for new product launches and to highlight new product features.\n\nWhether you engage an influencer marketing agency or not, investing in an all-in-one influencer marketing software is a good idea, helping you sift through suitable influencers, manage pricing negotiations and review and approve content.\n\n3. Decide on campaign goals and messaging\n\nTo ensure your influencer strategy succeeds, focus on your campaign's goals and needs. Determine whether you want to reach a new demographic, introduce a new product or highlight your brand values through influencers. Also, explore influencer trends to see what’s resonating in your industry.\n\nYour message is as crucial as your goal. And since influencers target specific audiences, refining your campaign messaging is important for effective content.\n\nInfluencer content is typically more conversational and personal, which helps differentiate it from brand-driven or sales-oriented posts. But while it’s important to preserve an influencer’s creativity and uniqueness, ensure their content aligns with your brand values.\n\n4. Establish influencer outreach: How to contact influencers\n\nYour outreach will depend on the type of influencer you’ve chosen. For example, celebrities and macro influencers often work through agencies, so you might have to connect with an agency to reach them. Some may also list their contact information for business inquiries in their bio and have a website that denotes brand partnerships.\n\nFor example, Summer Rayne Oakes has a multi-channel presence, which is a perk for her brand partners.\n\nFor micro-influencers, you could reach out directly in a private message via their social platform.\n\n5. Review and refine your strategy\n\nIt’s important to refine and review your strategy so you’ll be more successful with each campaign going forward. Having predetermined milestones where you’ll measure progress can prove very helpful in this.\n\nWhile these tips serve as a guide to help you craft a well-planned strategy, it's crucial to be aware of common mistakes to avoid in influencer marketing. We’ll dive into those, next.\n\nTo explore how AI tools can optimize your influencer marketings campaigns, read our detailed guide on AI influencer marketing: Enhancing your campaigns with AI tools.\n\nInfluencer marketing mistakes to avoid\n\nInfluencer marketing can be highly rewarding — if done right. Sidestep these potential pitfalls to ensure smooth influencer collaborations and successful campaign outcomes.\n\nFailing to define clear goals and KPIs\n\nFirst things first, know why you’re doing this in the first place. Partnering with an influencer is a big deal — you need to be clear about the purpose and goals of your campaign.\n\nHere are a few ways setting goals in advance can help you:\n\nChoose the right influencers: Defining goals helps you identify the specific characteristics and qualities you need in an influencer to achieve those outcomes. For example, if your goal is to increase brand awareness, you can find influencers who have a strong presence and reach within your niche.\n\nDefine and measure success: What does success mean to you? Is it the number of impressions, post engagement or the amount of traffic coming to your website? Define which KPIs and metrics to track both during and after the campaign to assess how well your influencer campaign is performing.\n\nKeep everyone on track: Setting clear goals ensures that both the brand and the influencer are working towards a common purpose. This facilitates effective communication and constructive feedback, saving everyone’s valuable time.\n\nHold influencers accountable: Establishing clear expectations and performance benchmarks makes influencers feel responsible. They know the results they need to provide and will focus on creating content that aligns with those goals.\n\nPrioritizing follower count over engagement\n\nA large following doesn't always mean high engagement. It’s entirely possible an influencer has millions of passive followers but very low engagement.\n\nInstead, partner with influencers with an engaged and loyal audience. A handful of people who trust the influencer are more valuable to your brand than thousands of indifferent followers unlikely to convert.\n\nLook at the influencer’s engagement metrics, comments and interactions, as well as past results for other brands to gauge their level of influence and likeability.\n\nNeglecting to research the influencer\n\nChoosing the wrong influencers, including fake influencers, can cost your business valuable time and money. But this hasn’t deterred marketers, with 60% of marketers intending to increase their influencer marketing budget over 2024, the Influencer Marketing Hub states.\n\nAn easy fix is to properly research the influencer of your choice, before signing a partnership. Vet influencers and evaluate their influencer media kit to ensure they share your vision and complement your brand’s personality.\n\nHere are some key areas to look into when researching influencers for your brand:\n\nAudience demographics: Study the influencer's followers to ensure your campaign reaches the right audience. Analyze factors like age, gender, location and interests (e.g., Millennials who identify as women) to determine if they are likely to become your customers.\n\nInteractions, voice and content: Look at the influencer’s engagement rate, the tone of voice they use and the type of content they create. For example, if your brand has a playful, casual image, partnering with an influencer known for their formal, business-oriented content might not be the best fit.\n\nAuthenticity and influence: Forced partnerships can appear insincere and hurt both your campaign and brand image. Collaborate with influencers who genuinely love your brand and products. Their followers trust them for a reason and you don't want your brand to get in the way of their (and your) credibility.\n\nExperience with branded content: Has the influencer worked with other brands in the past? Have they ever worked with your competitors? Carefully scrutinize their content to spot any red flags and gauge the value they can provide.\n\nWriting poorly constructed briefs\n\nCrafting well-structured briefs is key to maximizing your influencer marketing campaigns. A good social media campaign brief equips influencers with the details and resources they need to represent your brand effectively, without being overly restrictive.\n\nHere’s a quick rundown on what to include in your brief:\n\nWhat is the main goal of your campaign? What are you hoping to achieve?\n\nWhat is your company’s background? What is your brand and what product/s are you selling?\n\nWhat are your product’s key benefits, features and differentiators?\n\nWho is your target audience? Include an audience persona if you have one.\n\nWhat does your budget look like for this campaign?\n\nDo you have a timeline in mind?\n\nDo you want the influencer to use your brand assets? Provide them with your logo, colors and fonts if necessary.\n\nDon’t forget to inform influencers of any words or ideas to avoid in their content. For example, if you’re an eco-friendly brand, let the influencer know that sustainability is a core value and they should avoid using plastic and other such products in their content.\n\nRestricting the influencer's creative freedom\n\nWhile comprehensive briefs are important, there’s such a thing as too much information.\n\nAvoid going overboard with your guidelines. You don’t need to dictate the influencer’s exact words or actions. Doing so can stifle the influencer's creative freedom, resulting in content that looks scripted and inauthentic.\n\nSome brands also make the mistake of micro-managing every aspect of the content creation process. For example, you don’t need to vet multiple drafts just before they go live.\n\nRemember, influencers are the experts in creating content their audience loves and trusts. Your brand just needs to support them with resources they need to create great content for effective influencer marketing.\n\nNot setting expectations upfront\n\nEstablishing clear expectations beforehand enables a smooth, productive collaboration. The result? A successful campaign aligned with your goals.\n\nMake sure you agree on the following items in advance:\n\nTimeline and deliverables: Clearly outline the campaign timeline, including start and end dates, as well as any deadlines for content submission and publication. Also, specify the required deliverables, such as the number of posts, stories or videos the influencer needs to create.\n\nPayment and terms: Agree on the payment structure, whether it's a one-time fee, ongoing retainer or performance-based compensation. Discuss the payment schedule and any additional terms, such as bonuses for exceptional performance or penalties for missed deadlines.\n\nFocusing on the wrong metrics\n\nInfluencer marketing can offer more benefits to your business than merely boosting sales. Fixating only on conversions and revenue data can mislead brands into thinking their campaigns are not working.\n\nHere are some other metrics to consider when measuring the impact of your campaigns:\n\nEngagement metrics: Evaluate likes, comments, and shares to understand content resonance and audience interaction.\n\nBrand awareness metrics: Measure views, clicks and website traffic to gauge campaign reach and audience interest.\n\nFollower growth: Track new followers to determine influencer impact on brand visibility and audience expansion.\n\nInbound leads: Track the number of inquiries and messages your brand gets to analyze the campaign’s impact on inbound lead generation.\n\nHow to track influencer marketing campaigns\n\nThere are a few ways of measuring the success of your campaign.\n\nIf you want to keep a pulse on the content your influencers are creating and interacting with, you can create a specific branded hashtag, like #SproutPartner. The Sprout Social Smart Inbox makes it easy to see what’s being talked about with specific hashtags, or to watch for mentions of specific keywords.\n\nUse Sprout’s reporting feature to tag and track campaign-related posts. You can also compare how each post is performing and view metrics such as post engagements, clicks and impressions.\n\nSimilarly, if you’re aiming for more sales, giving out affiliate codes or tracking links will help you measure the revenue generated from influencers.\n\nCreate a successful influencer marketing strategy for your brand\n\nIt’s clear—influencers are the new wave in marketing. However, the influencer marketing world is constantly evolving, and in five years may be drastically different from today.\n\nWhile working with influencers has unique considerations, setting up a campaign is the same as most marketing campaigns: research, set a budget, determine goals, find your influencers, and review and revise. Once you’ve got a hold of the rhythm, creating different influencer marketing campaigns to meet your brand’s various needs will become second nature.\n\nIf you need more resources for your team on running influencer campaigns, check out our ultimate guide for running successful social media campaigns.\n\nInfluencer Marketing FAQs\n\nWhat are the 3 R’s of influencer marketing?\n\nThe three R’s in influencer marketing strategy are relevance, reach and resonance.\n\nReach alludes to the number of followers the influencer has and the people they can potentially reach with their content.\n\nRelevance is how well the influencer’s content aligns with your brand voice, target audience and marketing goals.\n\nResonance is the level of meaningful interactions and connections the influencer’s content creates with their followers, which translates to greater audience loyalty.\n\nWhat is the best strategy for influencer marketing?\n\nAn influencer marketing strategy needs meticulous planning. Here are five things you need to keep in mind to ace it.\n\nFind influencers and understand their payment structure\n\nSet a budget and management strategy\n\nDecide on campaign goals and messaging\n\nEstablish influencer outreach process\n\nReview and refine your strategy",

See “Customer Metrics” below for how Sprout Social defines number of customers contributing over $10,000 in ARR and number of customers contributing over $50,000 in ARR.\n\nCustomer Metrics\n\nGrew number of customers contributing over $10,000 in ARR to 8,966 customers as of June 30, 2024, up 21% compared to June 30, 2023.\n\nGrew number of customers contributing over $50,000 in ARR to 1,545 customers as of June 30, 2024, up 38% compared to June 30, 2023.\n\nRecent Customer Highlights\n\nDuring the second quarter, we had the opportunity to expand with great existing customers like: Salesforce, Honda, Applied Materials, Church and Dwight, Carharrt, Cummins, Netgear, Cintas, Porter Airlines Canada, Heidrick & Struggles International, Bausch & Lomb Americas, Auto Trader, Alterra Mountain, SentinelOne, Oliver Wyman, MasTec, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, Fareway Stores, and Allianz Partners.\n\nDuring the second quarter, we had the opportunity to land with great new customers like: Metropolitan Transportation Authority, American Outdoor Brands, GreenState Credit Union, Elanco Animal Health, Washington State University, University of Oklahoma, and Amentum.\n\nRecent Business Highlights\n\nSprout Social recently:\n\nRecognized by G2’s 2024 Summer Reports as a leader across 200 categories, adding to its recognition as the #1 Best Software Product (here)\n\nLaunched a series of AI-powered product enhancements alongside 20 new capabilities across its platform as part of a new quarterly product showcase (here)\n\nNamed Erika Trautman as Chief Product Officer to oversee Sprout’s global product organization (here)\n\nDemonstrated continued Chicago leadership by being named to the 2024 Fortune Best Workplaces in Chicago™ List, the Crain’s Fast 50 List and a Best Company to Work for: Midwest by U.S. News & World Report (here)\n\nThird Quarter and 2024 Financial Outlook\n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, the Company currently expects:\n\nTotal revenue between $101.9 million and $102.1 million, or growth of greater than 19%.\n\nNon-GAAP operating income to be between $6.5 million and $7.5 million.\n\nNon-GAAP net income per share of between $0.12 and $0.13 based on approximately 57.1 million weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding.\n\n“Our competitive advantages are standing out as we further define industry leadership,” said Joe Del Preto, CFO. “Although the software buying environment remains relatively subdued, we’re executing well and planning for a stronger second half of the year.”\n\nFor the full year 2024, the Company currently expects:\n\nTotal revenue to be between $405.0 million and $406.0 million. This assumes >20% organic Sprout revenue growth and accelerated Tagger subscription revenue growth.\n\nNon-GAAP operating income between $28.0 million and $29.0 million, including an estimated benefit from the deferred commission accounting change which will affect all future periods. Excluding this change, the Company expects Non-GAAP operating income between $15.0 million and $16.0 million.\n\nThis implies year-over-year Non-GAAP operating margin improvement of roughly 560bps. Excluding the accounting change this implies year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin improvement of roughly 240bps.\n\nNon-GAAP net income per share between $0.45 and $0.46 based on approximately 57.1 million weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding.\n\nThe Company’s third quarter and 2024 financial outlook is based on a number of assumptions that are subject to change and many of which are outside the Company’s control. If actual results vary from these assumptions, the Company’s expectations may change. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve these results.\n\nThe Company does not provide guidance for operating loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure to non-GAAP operating income, net loss per share, the most directly comparable GAAP measure to non-GAAP net income per share, or operating margin, the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Non-GAAP operating margin, and similarly cannot provide a reconciliation between its forecasted non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income per share and non-GAAP operating margin and these comparable GAAP measures without unreasonable effort due to the unavailability of reliable estimates for certain items. These items are not within the Company’s control and may vary greatly between periods and could significantly impact future financial results.\n\nConference Call Information\n\nThe financial results and business highlights will be discussed on a conference call and webcast scheduled at 4:00 p.m. Central Time (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time) today, August 1, 2024. Online registration for this event conference call can be found at https://conferencingportals.com/event/LOdFIxuX.

In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “can,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “explore,” “intend,” “long-term model,” “may,” “might” “outlook,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “strategy,” “target,” “will,” “would,” or the negative of these terms, and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements. However, not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. These statements may relate to our market size and growth strategy, our estimated and projected costs, margins, revenue, expenditures and customer and financial growth rates, our Q3 2024 and full year 2024 financial outlook, our plans and objectives for future operations, growth, initiatives or strategies. By their nature, these statements are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, including factors beyond our control, that could cause actual results, performance or achievement to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. These assumptions, uncertainties and risks include that, among others: we may not be able to sustain our revenue and customer growth rate in the future; price increases have and may continue to negatively impact demand for our products, customer acquisition and retention and reduce the total number of customers or customer additions; our business would be harmed by any significant interruptions, delays or outages in services from our platform, our API providers, or certain social media platforms; if we are unable to attract potential customers through unpaid channels, convert this traffic to free trials or convert free trials to paid subscriptions, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected; we may be unable to successfully enter new markets, manage our international expansion and comply with any applicable international laws and regulations; we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses or technologies successfully or achieve the expected benefits of such acquisitions and investments; unstable market and economic conditions, such as recession risks, effects of inflation, labor shortages, supply chain issues, high interest rates, and the impacts of current and potential future bank failures and impacts of ongoing overseas conflicts, could adversely impact our business and that of our existing and prospective customers, which may result in reduced demand for our products; we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness; covenants in our credit agreement may restrict our operations, and if we do not effectively manage our business to comply with these covenants, our financial condition could be adversely impacted; any cybersecurity-related attack, significant data breach or disruption of the information technology systems or networks on which we rely could negatively affect our business; changing regulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we collect and use personal information and harm our brand; and risks related to ongoing legal proceedings. Additional risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements are included under the caption “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 23, 2024, as well as any future reports that we file with the SEC. Moreover, you should interpret many of the risks identified in those reports as being heightened as a result of the current instability in market and economic conditions. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made and are based on information available to Sprout Social at the time those statements are made and/or management's good faith belief as of that time with respect to future events. Sprout Social assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made, except as required by law.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nWe have provided in this press release certain financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believes that use of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with other companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of our historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review these reconciliations.\n\nNon-GAAP gross profit. We define non-GAAP gross profit as GAAP gross profit, excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization expense associated with the acquired developed technology from our acquisition of Tagger Media, Inc. (the “Tagger acquisition”). We believe non-GAAP gross profit provides our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as it eliminates the effect of stock-based compensation and amortization expense, which are often unrelated to overall operating performance. In 2023, we revised our definition of non-GAAP gross profit to exclude amortization expense associated with the acquired developed technology from the Tagger acquisition.\n\nNon-GAAP gross margin. We define non-GAAP gross margin as non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of revenue.\n\nNon-GAAP operating income (loss). We define non-GAAP operating income (loss) as GAAP loss from operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses and amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets from the Tagger acquisition. We believe non-GAAP operating income (loss) provides our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as it eliminates the effect of stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses and amortization expense, which are often unrelated to overall operating performance. In 2023, we revised our definition of non-GAAP operating income (loss) to exclude acquisition-related expenses in connection with the Tagger acquisition and amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets from the Tagger acquisition.\n\nNon-GAAP operating margin. We define non-GAAP operating margin as non-GAAP operating income (loss) as a percentage of revenue.\n\nNon-GAAP net income (loss). We define non-GAAP net income (loss) as GAAP net loss, excluding stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, and amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets from the Tagger acquisition. We believe non-GAAP net income (loss) provides our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as this non-GAAP financial measure eliminates the effect of stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses and amortization expense, which are often unrelated to overall operating performance. In 2023, we revised our definition of non-GAAP net income (loss) to exclude acquisition-related expenses in connection with the Tagger acquisition and amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets from the Tagger acquisition.\n\nNon-GAAP net income (loss) per share. We define non-GAAP net income (loss) per share as GAAP net loss per share attributable to common shareholders, basic and diluted, excluding stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses and amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets from the Tagger acquisition. We believe non-GAAP net income (loss) per share provides our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as this non-GAAP financial measure eliminates the effect of stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses and amortization expense, which are often unrelated to overall operating performance. In 2023, we revised our definition of non-GAAP net income (loss) per share to exclude acquisition-related expenses in connection with the Tagger acquisition and amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets from the Tagger acquisition.\n\nNon-GAAP free cash flow. We define non-GAAP free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less expenditures for property and equipment, acquisition-related costs and interest. Non-GAAP free cash flow does not reflect our future contractual obligations or represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for a given period. We believe non-GAAP free cash flow is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides information to management and investors about the amount of cash used in our core operations that, after expenditures for property and equipment, acquisition-related costs and interest, is not available for strategic initiatives. In 2023, we revised our definition of non-GAAP free cash flow to exclude payments related to acquisition-related costs associated with the Tagger acquisition (which are not applicable for the periods presented) and cash paid for interest on our revolving line of credit.\n\nNon-GAAP free cash flow margin. We define non-GAAP free cash flow margin as non-GAAP free cash flow as a percentage of revenue.\n\nNon-GAAP sales and marketing expenses, non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP general and administrative expenses. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses, non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP general and administrative expenses are defined as sales and marketing expenses, research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses, respectively, less stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide our management and investors with insight into day-to-day operating expenses given that these measures eliminate the effect of stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses. In 2023, we revised our definition of non-GAAP general and administrative expenses to exclude acquisition-related expenses in connection with the Tagger acquisition and amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets from the Tagger acquisition.\n\nKey Business Metrics\n\nAnnual recurring revenue (“ARR”). We define ARR as the annualized revenue run-rate of subscription agreements from all customers as of the last date of the specified period. We believe ARR is an indicator of the scale of our entire platform while mitigating fluctuations due to seasonality and contract term.\n\nRemaining performance obligations (“RPO”). RPO, or remaining performance obligations, represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, and includes deferred revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized in future periods.\n\nCurrent remaining performance obligations (“cRPO”). cRPO, or current RPO, represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, and includes deferred revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized in the next 12 months.\n\nNumber of customers. We define a customer as a unique account, multiple accounts containing a common non-personal email domain, or multiple accounts governed by a single agreement or entity. We believe that the number of customers using our platform is an indicator of our market penetration.\n\nNumber of customers contributing more than $10,000 in ARR. We define number of customers contributing more than $10,000 in ARR as those on a paid subscription plan that had more than $10,000 in ARR as of a period end. We view the number of customers that contribute more than $10,000 in ARR as a measure of our ability to scale with our customers and attract larger organizations. We define a customer as a unique account, multiple accounts containing a common non-personal email domain, or multiple accounts governed by a single agreement or entity. We believe this represents potential for future growth, including expanding within our current customer base.\n\nNumber of customers contributing more than $50,000 in ARR. We define number of customers contributing more than $50,000 in ARR as those on a paid subscription plan that had more than $50,000 in ARR as of a period end. We view the number of customers that contribute more than $50,000 in ARR as a measure of our ability to scale with large customers and attract sophisticated organizations. We define a customer as a unique account, multiple accounts containing a common non-personal email domain, or multiple accounts governed by a single agreement or entity. We believe this represents potential for future growth, including expanding within our current customer base.\n\nDollar-based net retention rate. We calculate dollar-based net retention rate by dividing the ARR from our customers as of December 31st in the reported year by the ARR from those same customers as of December 31st in the previous year. This calculation is net of upsells, contraction, cancellation or expansion during the period but excludes ARR from new customers. We use dollar-based net retention to evaluate the long-term value of our customer relationships, because we believe this metric reflects our ability to retain and expand subscription revenue generated from our existing customers.\n\nDollar-based net retention rate excluding SMB customers. We calculate dollar-based net retention rate excluding SMB customers by dividing the ARR from all customers excluding ARR from customers that we have identified or that self-identified as having less than 50 employees as of December 31st in the reported year by the ARR from those same customers as of December 31st of the previous year. This calculation is net of upsells, contraction, cancellation or expansion during the period but excludes ARR from new customers. We used dollar-based net retention excluding SMB customers to evaluate the long-term value of our larger customer relationships, because we believe this metric reflects our ability to retain and expand subscription revenue generated from our existing customers.\n\nWhile we no longer believe that ARR and number of customers are key performance indicators of Sprout Social’s business, these metrics are necessary for an understanding of how we define number of customers contributing over $10,000 in ARR and number of customers contributing over $50,000 in ARR. For this purpose, we define ARR as the annualized revenue run-rate of subscription agreements from all customers as of the last date of the specified period and we define a customer as a unique account, multiple accounts containing a common non-personal email domain, or multiple accounts governed by a single agreement or entity.\n\nAvailability of Information on Sprout Social’s Website and Social Media Profiles\n\nInvestors and others should note that Sprout Social routinely announces material information to investors and the marketplace using SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, webcasts and the Sprout Social Investors website.

      "# [Always Up-to-Date Guide to Social Media Video Specs [Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, X, YouTube, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Snapchat] by Mary Keutelian on 2024-08-27](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-video-specs-guide/)\nLast Updated: August 27, 2024\n\nStaying relevant and capturing your audience’s attention is a constant challenge for marketers. And now that brands rely on video content more than ever, it’s critical to use the correct social media video specs and advertising video sizes.\n\nTo simplify marketers’ efforts, we created a complete guide of every single social media video spec and advertising video dimension.\n\nBefore we start, here are some additional resources that keep the information in one place:\n\nEasily reference our social media video specs in our always up-to-date Google Doc.\n\nCheck out our social media image sizes guide for help on static images.\n\nWant to get better results with video? Download our social media video content workbook.\n\nFind more information about Sprout-supported files and sizes in our Help Center.\n\nSocial Media Video Specs & Ad Sizes By Network\n\nWe’ve gathered data on each social network’s specific video sizes and specs. Simply click the links below to jump to your desired network:\n\nFacebook\n\nInstagram\n\nTikTok\n\nTwitter\n\nYouTube\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nSnapchat\n\nStart your free trial\n\nFacebook Video Specs\n\nFacebook video is consumed at higher rates each year, so it’s no wonder why so many marketers search for the correct Facebook video specs.\n\nThere are simply so many types of videos you can share on Facebook and the platform updates its design frequently. Each video format has different dimensions and specs, which can make it confusing to know whether or not you’re uploading the correct format for organic or paid posts. Follow the specs below to optimize your posts.\n\nIn-Feed Shared Post Video (Landscape & Portrait)\n\nThe most common type of video on Facebook comes from shared posts. This type of video lives in your Facebook Feed, and can be shared by brands or your friends. While it’s not as easy to get organic reach on Facebook, it’s still a viable way to share video.\n\nYou can choose between two video orientations: Landscape and Portrait. Here’s a look at the video specs for both.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nResolution: 1280×720, 720×1280\n\nMinimum width: 1200 pixels\n\nAspect ratio: 16:9, 9:16\n\nMax file size: 10GB\n\nRecommended video formats: MP4, MOV\n\nVideo length: 1 second to 240 minutes\n\nBitrate: 256kbps\n\nFrame rate: 30fps\n\nSprout Guidelines\n\nSame as above, except:\n\nMax file size: 3GB max in Sprout\n\nVideo length: 45 minutes max, if uploading in Sprout\n\nSupported file types: MP4, MOV, AVI\n\nFacebook Reels\n\nThe convenience of cross-posting your Instagram Reels to Facebook expands the reach of your videos. This format appears organically in feeds but often gets priority on Facebook feeds.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nResolution: 1080p\n\nAspect ratio: 9:16\n\nMax file size: No file size limit\n\nRecommended video formats: MP4\n\nVideo length: 3 seconds to 90 seconds\n\nFrame rate: 24fps – 60fps\n\nSprout Guidelines\n\nSame as above, except:\n\nVideo length: 60 seconds max\n\nSupported file types: MP4, MOV, AVI\n\nFrame rate: 30fps recommended in Sprout\n\nFacebook Stories\n\nSimilar to Instagram Stories, you can post Facebook Stories to extend the reach of your posts. Users who may not follow you on Instagram will be able to view and interact with your Stories.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nResolution: 1080p\n\nMinimum width: 500 pixels\n\nAspect ratio: 9:16 and 4:5 to 1.91:1\n\nMax file size: 4GB\n\nRecommended video formats: MP4 or MOV\n\nVideo length: 1 second to 60 seconds\n\nFacebook Video Ad Specs\n\nThere are more than 10 million advertisers now on Facebook and having the right specs for your ads can be tricky. Each type of Facebook video ad is different, so let’s break down the specs for each type of video you can produce.\n\nIn-Feed Video Ads\n\nThese Facebook video ads are the sponsored equivalent of in-feed posts, and they follow similar guidelines to in-feed video posts.\n\nVideo guidelines\n\nResolution: 1080×1080 minimum\n\nMinimum width: 120 pixels\n\nMinimum height: 120 pixels\n\nAspect ratio: 1:1 (for desktop or mobile) or 4:5 (for mobile only)\n\nMax file size: 4GB\n\nRecommended video formats: MP4, MOV or GIF\n\nVideo length: 1 seconds to 240 minutes\n\nFrame rate: 30fps\n\nCharacter limits\n\nPrimary text: 125 characters\n\nHeadline: 27 characters\n\nDescription: 27 characters\n\nCarousel Video Ads\n\nFacebook Carousel Video ads allow brands to showcase multiple videos (or images) and a landing page link within a user’s Facebook feed. It has grown in popularity because its unique scrolling feature allows users to see more content before clicking. In fact, Digiday estimated Carousel Ads to be 10x more effective than standard social media ads.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nResolution: 1080×1080 minimum\n\nAspect ratio: 1:1\n\nMax file size: 4GB\n\nRecommended video formats: MP4, MOV or GIF\n\nVideo length: 1 seconds to 240 minutes\n\nFrame rate: 30fps\n\nCharacter limits\n\nPrimary text: 125 characters\n\nHeadline: 32 characters\n\nDescription: 18 characters\n\nLanding Page URL: Required\n\nCollection Video Ads (Mobile)\n\nThe Facebook Collection ads showcase multiple images and a main video above it. This is perfect for displaying multiple products (or various colors of a single product) plus a video. The ad type has been popular so far with retailers and clothing companies as an instant storefront or lookbook.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nResolution: 1080×1080 minimum\n\nAspect ratio: 1:1\n\nMax file size: 4GB\n\nRecommended video formats: MP4, MOV or GIF\n\nVideo length: 1 seconds to 240 minutes\n\nFrame rate: 30fps\n\nCharacter Limits\n\nPrimary text: 125 characters\n\nHeadline max: 40 characters\n\nLanding Page URL: Required\n\nInstant Experience Video Ads\n\nFacebook Instant Experience ads open up a full-screen experience after the first click, which can be further customized with a variety of interactive features. This can include multiple video experiences, including features to auto-play on loop.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nMinimum width: 720 pixels\n\nMax file size: 4GB\n\nRecommended video formats: MP4, MOV\n\nVideo length: Up to 2 minutes\n\nFrame rate: 30fps\n\nSlideshow Video Ad\n\nFacebook’s Slideshow videos were built for advertisers wanting to reach audiences with slower internet connections. Instead of a regular video, slideshows are just that–a slideshow of images or video in an ad display.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nResolution: 1080×1080\n\nAspect ratio: 16:9 or 1:1\n\nRecommended video formats: MP4 or MPV\n\nSlideshow duration length: 15 seconds\n\nFacebook Stories Ads\n\nFacebook added the Stories feature – photo or short video posts that are only available for 24 hours. In addition to user-generated organic posts, Stories ads are available to run between sets of posted Stories. While most users will be sharing immediate and organic updates from their phone’s camera, the guidelines for this format are similar for both paid and organic ad posts.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nResolution: 1080×1080\n\nMinimum width: 500 pixels\n\nAspect ratio: 9:16\n\nMax file size: 4GB\n\nRecommended video formats: MP4, MPV and GIF\n\nVideo length: 1 second to 2 minutes\n\nFrame rate: 30fps\n\nCharacter Limits\n\nPrimary text: 125 characters\n\nHeadline: 40 characters\n\nFor more information on the video specs for Facebook, visit the Facebook Help Center.\n\nInstagram Video Specs\n\nInstagram launched video capabilities in 2013 and quickly saw enough success to start advertising on the platform in 2015. Since then, video only continues to grow as an engaging social format. Needless to say, Instagram videos are absolutely worth the investment.\n\nCarousel Video\n\nSince 2015, Instagram crafted its video formats to allow three different styles: landscape, square and vertical. However, like the app, Instagram and how video is presented has evolve. Gone are the days of IGTV and Instagram Video. Video can be natively included as a post or carousel post, or they can be uploaded as Reels, but more on Reels later.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nResolution: 1080×1080, 1080×1350\n\nAspect ratio: 9:16\n\nMax file size: 4GB\n\nRecommended video formats: MP4, MOV\n\nVideo length: 3 seconds to 60 minutes\n\nFrame rate: 23-60 fps\n\nSprout Guidelines\n\nSame as above, except:\n\nMax file size: 100MB in Sprout\n\nVideo length: 60 seconds max\n\nInstagram Reels\n\nIntroduced in 2020, Instagram Reels are another option for your video strategy on Instagram. These short-form, easily digestible videos are becoming the preferred type of content in Instagram feeds.\n\nFortunately for social content creators looking to easily generate a lot of content for Instagram, most of the video specs for Instagram Reels are fairly similar to other formats on the platform.\n\nAs Instagram has started to add separate tabs for different content types, thumbnails will be cropped differently on each view. If the viewer is on the first tab that has all content types, the thumbnail will be cropped to the traditional square post size of 1:1–center your subjects and plan to avoid undesirable vertical cropping.\n\nVideo Guidelines:\n\nResolution: 720p minimum\n\nAspect ratio: 0.01:1 to 10:1; 9:16 recommended\n\nMax file size: 4GB max\n\nRecommended video formats: MP4 or MOV\n\nVideo length: 3 seconds to 15 minutes\n\nRecording in-app is limited to 90 seconds; users can upload videos up to 15 minutes\n\nFrame rate: 23-60 fps\n\nSprout Guidelines\n\nSame as above, except:\n\nMax file size: 1GB in Sprout\n\nVideo length: 60 seconds max\n\nCover Photo Size:\n\nSize: 420p x 654p\n\nAspect ratio: 1:1.55\n\nInstagram Stories\n\nInstagram Stories are short-form videos that display for 24-hours on your profile. Followers and users can access your Stories directly from your profile; followers have the luxury of accessing your Stories directly from their feed, where Stories for accounts they follow display directly at the top of their screen.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nResolution: 1080×1080\n\nMinimum width: 500 pixels\n\nAspect ratio: 9:16\n\nMax file size: 4GB\n\nRecommended video formats: MP4, MOV or GIF\n\nVideo length: 1 second to 90 seconds\n\nFrame rate: 23-60 fps\n\nCharacter Limits\n\nPrimary text: 125 characters\n\nConsider leaving roughly 250 pixels of the top of the video free from text to avoid covering them with the profile icon.\n\nInstagram Video Ad Specs\n\nInstagram’s advertising revenue has significantly increased over the last year. In fact, Instagram reportedly earned $43.2 billion in ad revenue in 2022. The push for Instagram advertising is real and marketers have to be ready to take advantage with engaging videos.\n\nCarousel Video Ad\n\nMuch like Facebook’s Carousel Ads, Instagram offers a similar feature. Carousel ads allow users to see more of a product or feature than a single image or video. With Instagram, your carousel video ads can have 2-10 cards with a full-width call to action below the ad.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nResolution: 1080×1080\n\nAspect ratio: 1:1\n\nMax file size: 4GB (video) 30MB (image)\n\nRecommended video formats: MP4, MOV or GIF\n\nVideo length: 1 second to 2 minutes\n\nNumber of Carousel cards: 2 (minimum) to 10 (maximum)\n\nFrame rate: 23-60 fps\n\nInstagram Stories Ads\n\nIt didn’t take long for Instagram Stories to feature ads within users’ story feeds. Brands can seamlessly integrate their video content between other Instagram users’ Stories.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nResolution: 1080×1080\n\nMinimum width: 500 pixels\n\nAspect ratio: 9:16\n\nMax file size: 4GB\n\nRecommended video formats: MP4, MOV or GIF\n\nVideo length: 1 second to 60 minutes\n\nFrame rate: 23-60 fps\n\nCharacter Limits\n\nPrimary text: 125 characters\n\nConsider leaving roughly 250 pixels of the top of the video free from text to avoid covering them with the profile icon\n\nIf you’re looking for further information including images, check out our complete guide to all the Instagram ad sizes.\n\nFor more information on the video specs for Instagram, visit the Facebook Help Center.\n\nFind more information about Sprout-supported files and sizes in our Help Center.\n\nTikTok Video Specs\n\nTikTok has quickly gained attention in the social space. Fortunately, TikTok’s focus on easy to create and share videos means it’s not hard to start producing video content for the platform, and there are plenty of trends to inspire TikTok content creation.\n\nTikTok In-Feed Videos\n\nTikTok videos are all about the ease of creation, editing and sharing, so it makes sense that specs are more or less oriented around typical mobile phone dimensions. One key trait to keep in mind if you’re trying to repurpose video content across platforms is that videos uploaded from another file source, rather than recorded on the app, can be longer than 60 seconds.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nResolution: 1080×1920\n\nAspect ratio: 9:16\n\nMax file size: 72MB (Android users) and 278.6MB (iOS users)\n\nRecommended video formats: MP4 or MOV\n\nVideo length: Up to 3 minutes recorded in-app or 10 minutes when uploaded from another source\n\nFrame rate: 23-60fps\n\nSprout Guidelines\n\nSame as above, except:\n\nMax file size: 1GB max in Sprout\n\nVideo length: 10 minutes max, if uploading in Sprout\n\nSupported file types: MP4, MOV, WEBM\n\nTikTok Feed Ads\n\nTikTok ads are a rapidly evolving opportunity for brands. The in-feed option for paid TikTok content is fairly similar to the formatting for existing organic content. To fine-tune paid content for the best performance, be sure to consult TikTok’s business center for the latest tips.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nResolution: 540×960, 640×640 or 960×540\n\nAspect ratio: 9:16, 1:1 or 16:9\n\nMax file size: Up to 500MB\n\nRecommended video formats: MP4, MOV, MPEG, 3PG or AVI\n\nVideo length: 5 seconds to 60 seconds\n\nBitrate: 516 kbps minimum\n\nFrame rate: 23-60fps\n\nCharacter Limits\n\nAd description: 1-100 Latin alphabet letters and 1-50 Asian characters\n\nTwitter Video Specs\n\nX (formerly Twitter) is a popular space to share and interact with different social media videos. For marketers, it’s all about keeping a user’s attention with enthralling and click-worthy video content. In the sports and entertainment industry, Twitter is often the go-to for sharing video content, so it’s critical to learn the correct Twitter video specs.\n\nTwitter Landscape & Portrait Videos\n\nTwitter provides two formats of in-feed video content to share with your followers: landscape and portrait. These specific formats are only available for uploading video directly to Twitter, rather than sharing YouTube or other links.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nResolution: 1280×720 (landscape), 720×1280 (portrait), 720×720 (square)\n\nAspect ratio: 16:9 (landscape or portrait), 1:1 (square)\n\nMax file size: 512MB*\n\nVideo length: 0.5 seconds to 140 seconds*\n\nFrame rate: 30fps or 60fps\n\n*Twitter Pro Media users can upload files up to 1GB and videos up to 10 minutes.\n\nSprout Guidelines\n\nSame as above, except:\n\nMax file size: 512MB max in Sprout\n\nVideo length: 140 seconds max, if uploading in Sprout\n\nSupported file types: MP4, MOV\n\nCharacter Limits\n\nMaximum count: 280 characters.\n\nTwitter Videos Ad Specs\n\nLooking to promote your video through paid ads on Twitter? Luckily, you can use the same exact formats from Twitter organic videos. Stick to the same specs for both organic and paid video to ensure maximum visibility.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nResolution: 1280×720 (landscape), 720×1280 (portrait), 720×720 (square)\n\nAspect ratio: 16:9 (landscape or portrait), 1:1 (square)\n\nMax file size: 512MB\n\nVideo length: 0.5 seconds to 140 seconds\n\nFrame rate: 30fps or 60fps\n\nCharacter Limits\n\nMaximum count: 280 characters.\n\nFor more information on the video specs for Twitter, visit the Twitter Help Center.\n\nYouTube Video Specs\n\nAs the second-largest search engine behind Google, YouTube is an essential network for video content. For marketers, YouTube is a great space to promote, educate and share video content around your brand.\n\nAs YouTube continues to grow as a destination for video content, it hosts everything from short-form promotional videos to full-length movies and TV. This means users are streaming content on all sorts of devices, which could have different levels of zoom or overscan.\n\nWhile there’s no hard and fast rules from the platform on how to approach the video editing concept of “title safe” areas where text like titles and subtitles aren’t cut off, you do want to avoid placing these types of visual elements right at the edges of your video area. Read on for more specifics on each format available on YouTube.\n\nVideo Player (Standard YouTube Video)\n\nWhile YouTube allows users to upload various types of media formats and use plenty of different dimensions, organically, there’s truly only one format for the video player. Organic videos should all follow a 16:9 ratio, but can be uploaded 4:3. However, the smaller ratio will automatically pillarbox the sides to still make it fit in the player.\n\nYouTube has seven recommended dimensions and ratios for standard YouTube videos:\n\nVideo Guidelines for Non-Verified Accounts\n\nResolution:\n\n4320p (8k): 7680×4320\n\n2160p (4K): 3840×2160\n\n1440p (2k): 2560×1440\n\n1080p (HD): 1920×1080\n\n720p (HD): 1280×720\n\n480p (SD): 854×480\n\n360p (SD): 640×360\n\n240p (SD): 426×240\n\nAspect ratio: 16:9 default\n\nMax file size: 5GB max in Sprout\n\nRecommended video formats: MOV, MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG4, MP4, MPG, AVI, WMV, MPEGPS, FLV, 3GPP, WebM, DNxHR, ProRes, CineForm, HEVC (h265)\n\nVideo length: Up to 15 minutes\n\nFrame rate: 24, 25 or 30fps\n\nSprout Guidelines\n\nSame as above, except:\n\nMax file size: 5GB max in Sprout\n\nVideo length: 15 minutes max, if uploading in Sprout\n\nSupported file types: MP4, MOV\n\nVideo Guidelines for Verified Accounts\n\nResolution:\n\n4320p (8k): 7680×4320\n\n2160p (4K): 3840×2160\n\n1440p (2k): 2560×1440\n\n1080p (HD): 1920×1080\n\n720p (HD): 1280×720\n\n480p (SD): 854×480\n\n360p (SD): 640×360\n\n240p (SD): 426×240\n\nAspect ratio: 16:9 default\n\nMax file size: 256GB or 12 hours, whichever is less\n\nRecommended video formats: MOV, MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG4, MP4, MPG, AVI, WMV, MPEGPS, FLV, 3GPP, WebM, DNxHR, ProRes, CineForm, HEVC (h265)\n\nVideo length: Up to 12 hours, dependent on file size\n\nFrame rate: 24, 25 or 30fps\n\nSprout Guidelines\n\nSame as above, except:\n\nMax file size: 128GB max in Sprout\n\nVideo length: 12 hours max, if uploading in Sprout\n\nSupported file types: MP4, MOV\n\nYouTube Shorts\n\nIntroduced late 2020, YouTube Shorts have recently made its debut as another short-form video feature. These videos are a new way to watch, create and discover short-form content. Because people are watching more short-form videos globally, using Shorts is a new way to reach wider audiences to entertain or educate.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nResolution:\n\n4320p (8k): 4320×7680\n\n2160p (4K): 2160×3840\n\n1440p (2k): 1440×2560\n\n1080p (HD): 1080×1920\n\n720p (HD): 720×1280\n\n480p (SD): 480×854\n\n360p (SD): 360×640\n\n240p (SD): 240×426\n\nAspect ratio: 9:16 or 1:1\n\nRecommended video formats: MOV, MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG4, MP4, MPG, AVI, WMV, MPEGPS, FLV, 3GPP, WebM, DNxHR, ProRes, CineForm, HEVC (h265)\n\nVideo length: Up to 60 seconds\n\nFor more information on the video specs for YouTube, visit the Google Help Center.\n\nYouTube Video Ad Specs\n\nStandard YouTube videos are pretty straightforward, but there are a few video ad formats to learn if you want to advertise on the network. According to data from Google, brands advertising on YouTube with Discovery ads see incremental conversions.\n\nSkippable, Non-Skippable, Mid-Roll, Bumper Video, In-Feed Display Ads\n\nWe’ve put these five YouTube video ads specs together because in the end, they all play through the standard YouTube video player. That means all of these ad types follow the same dimensions as the non-ad videos, but only differ in video length. Let’s look at each ad type:\n\nSkippable Video Ad: This YouTube ad type is played before, during or after the content and becomes skippable after 5 seconds. This ad format is the only one allowing advertisers to monetize views from any viewing device.\n\nNon-Skippable Video Ad: This YouTube ad type is played before the content and users must watch the full 15 seconds maximum ad (can also be added during or after video).\n\nMid-roll Video Ad: This YouTube ad type is played mid-view (like TV commercials) and is only available for videos 8 minutes or longer. Ads are added either manually or automatically. Mid-rolls can be skippable, but users must watch 30 seconds or the entire ad (whichever is shorter).\n\nBumper Video Ads: This YouTube ad type is played before the content. This short 6-second max video cannot be skipped and is usually optimized for mobile views.\n\nDisplay Ads: These ads are shown in users’ search queries and sometimes appear in the right video column when watching a video. These ads are static, which means they don’t automatically play. However, once the video is clicked, the type of content displayed can simply follow the standard video player guidelines.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nResolution: 1920 x 1080 (horizontal), 1080 x 1920 (vertical), 1080 x 1080 (square)\n\nAspect ratio: 16:9 (horizontal), 9:16 (vertical), 1:1 (square)\n\nMax file size: 256GB\n\nRecommended video formats: MPG\n\nVideo length:\n\nSkippable Video Ad: No maximum, but recommended 15 – 20 seconds for awareness, 2 – 3 minutes for consideration, and 15 – 20 seconds for action.\n\nNon-Skippable Video Ad: 15 or 20 seconds, depending on marketing\n\nMid-roll Video Ad: 30 seconds minimum\n\nBumper Video Ad: 6 seconds maximum\n\nIn-Feed (Display) Video Ad: 15-20 seconds for awareness, 2-3 minutes for consideration\n\nFor more information on the video specs for YouTube, visit the Google Help Center.\n\nLinkedIn Video Specs\n\nWith 66% of consumers finding short-form video the most engaging type of in-feed social content, LinkedIn adopted the use of video on the platform. If you’re looking to incorporate video into your LinkedIn marketing strategy, then it’s important to do it with the right specs. While some technical requirements may match other networks, there are some specs that are specific to LinkedIn.\n\nLinkedIn In-Feed Video\n\nWhile before the only video format you were able to upload was a shared video, LinkedIn has expanded its capabilities to upload your own videos into the platform.\n\nLinkedIn video sizes\n\nResolution: 256×144 (min) and 4096×2304 (max)\n\nAspect ratio: 1:2.4, 2.4:1\n\nMax file size: 5GB\n\nRecommended video formats: AAC, ASF, FLV, MP3, MP4, MPEG-1, MPEG-4, MKV, WebM, H264/AVC, Vorbis, VP8, VP9, WMV2, WMV3\n\nVideo length: Up to 10 minutes\n\nFrame rate: 60fps\n\nBitrate: Up to 30mbps\n\nSprout Guidelines\n\nSame as above, except:\n\nMax file size: 5GB max in Sprout for Company and Personal Pages\n\nVideo length: 10 minutes max, if uploading in Sprout\n\nSupported file types: ASF, AVI, MP4, FLV, MKV, WEBM, Quicktime\n\nFor more information on the video specs for LinkedIn, visit the LinkedIn Help Center.\n\nLinkedIn Video Ads\n\nAs of 2018, LinkedIn now offers video ads. The requirements are a little bit different than in-feed video, so be sure to consider them when developing ads for your paid campaign.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nRecommended dimensions and resolutions:\n\nVertical (4:5): Min 360 x 450 pixels, Max 1536 x 1920 pixels\n\nVertical (9:16): Min 360 x 640 pixels, Max 1080 x 1920 pixels\n\nLandscape (16:9): Min 640 x 360 pixels, Max 1920 x 1080 pixels\n\nSquare (1:1): Min 360 x 360 pixels, Max 1920 x 1920 pixels\n\nAspect ratio:\n\nVertical: 4:5, 9:16\n\nLandscape: 16:9\n\nSquare: 1:1\n\nMax file size: 200MB\n\nRecommended video formats: MP4\n\nVideo length: 3 seconds to 30 minutes\n\nFrame rate: 30fps\n\nCharacter Limits\n\nAd name: 255 characters\n\nHeadline: 70 characters recommended; 200 characters maximum\n\nIntroductory text: 150 characters recommended; 600 characters maximum\n\nFor more information on the video specs for LinkedIn ads, visit LinkedIn Marketing Solutions Help.\n\nPinterest Promoted Video Specs\n\nPinterest allows video upload for business accounts only, so they have specs designed for brands to get the most out of the highly visual and inspirational lifestyle content frequently shared on the platform.\n\nShared Video Pins and Standard Width Video Ads\n\nIn addition to ads, Pinterest Business Accounts can upload organic video content. There are two formats: standard and max width video. Below are the dimensions for standard width video ads and standard Pins.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nAspect ratio: 1:1, 2:3, 4:5, 9:16\n\nMax file size: 2GB\n\nRecommended video formats: MP4, MOV or M4V\n\nVideo length: 4 seconds to 15 minutes\n\nCharacter Limits\n\nTitle: Up to 100 characters\n\nDescription: Up to 500 characters\n\nMax Width Video Ads\n\nPinterest allows you to publish standard width and maximum width video ads. Maximum width videos expand across mobile users’ entire screens. These specs apply only to maximum width video ads; standard video ad specs can be found above. Note that maximum width video ads are only paid ads.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nAspect ratio: 1:1\n\nMax file size: 2GB\n\nRecommended video formats: MP4, MOV or M4V\n\nVideo length: 4 seconds to 15 minutes\n\nCharacter Limits\n\nTitle: Up to 100 characters\n\nDescription: Up to 500 characters\n\nFor more information on the video specs for Pinterest ads, visit Pinterest Business Help.\n\nSnapchat Video Specs\n\nSnapchat is still an active network for younger generations to share video content. Whether it’s through FOMO-inducing filters, Snapchat is a hotbed for video sharing.\n\nSingle Videos and Single Video Ad\n\nThis video format is the most common across the channel and is the main way users communicate back and forth through the app. However, your business can post videos to its story so others can see what your business is up to. Just follow these specs:\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nResolution: 1080×1920\n\nAspect ratio: 9:16\n\nMax file size: 1GB\n\nRecommended video formats: MP4 or MOV\n\nVideo length: 3 seconds to 180 seconds\n\nCharacter Limits\n\nBrand: 25 characters\n\nHeadline: 34 characters\n\nLong-Form Story Video Ad\n\nSnapchat currently offers one main video format for ads, which is known as the Story Ad.
