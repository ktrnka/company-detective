      "# [Sprout Social on 2024-02-26](https://sproutsocial.com/security/)\nA proven track-record\n\n99.99% uptime is a key performance indicator (KPI) for our Engineering group. At the time of writing, we had higher than 99.95% uptime over the prior 6 and 12 months.\n\nTransparency to customers\n\nTrust begins with open communication. We publicly share real-time system status and metrics on our Status Websites, https://www.sproutsocialstatus.com for Sprout Social and https://www.sproutadvocacystatus.com for Employee Advocacy. There we communicate incidents and planned maintenance, including any customer impact, and we display system health metrics sourced from independent third-party providers. Customers may subscribe to receive immediate SMS or email notifications of future incidents.\n\nSocial media feeds\n\nOur data ingest layer combines multiple connections to social network APIs. As partners, social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn provide us with higher levels of redundancy and access to their support teams.\n\nBackups\n\nBackups are taken frequently, encrypted in transit and at rest, and are tested regularly. Backups are kept \"off-site\" in Amazon S3 which stores files on multiple physical devices in multiple facilities offering 99.999999999% durability and 99.99% availability.\n\nTransparency to our teams\n\nInternally we practice multidisciplinary, blameless post-mortem analysis, and seek to grow our people, procedures, and systems in the aftermath of failure. Fear is the enemy of progress.\n\nIsolation\n\nOur highly distributed backend platform employs isolation design patterns to mitigate risks across components. Failures of one component rarely affect other components.\n\nRecovery point objectives (RPOs)\n\nRecovery strategies are designed to provide up-to-date RPOs at low Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs), with older data recovered against longer RTOs. This is consistent with customer expectations in Social Media, allowing customers to meet the immediate needs of their customers.\n\nDevOps best practices\n\nOur engineering team practices Infrastructure-as-code, providing correctness, consistency, testability, and speed to recovery. All 24/7/365 on-call team members are empowered to rebuild systems and topologies with full consistency. In the event of system loss, our Engineering team quickly recreates systems by executing the infrastructure code.\n\nMonitoring & on-call support\n\nWe monitor continuously from around the world, displaying, alerting, and reporting upon our entire technical environments in real-time. Supporting customers is a collaboration between our customer-facing support team and our engineering team. Specialized engineers are on call 24/7/365.\n\nWhen problems occur our teams are promptly notified, automatically provided with context, and are enabled with tools to help collaborate efficiently with peers. We employ a triage pager system to ensure alerts quickly and reliably reach engineers.\n\nEncryption at rest & in transit\n\nAll communications over public networks with Sprout Socialâs application and API utilize HTTPS with TLS 1.2 or higher enforced. All data is stored encrypted-at-rest with AES-256 or greater, including backups.\n\nSystem administration\n\nBest practices are utilized, such as least privilege, central configuration management, and stringent host and network firewall policies. Servers are patched automatically on a regular schedule, with high-priority patches applied manually out-of-cycle.\n\nThird party risk management\n\nSprout Social reviews the security posture of our critical third party product and service providers on a regular basis. Sprout Social's subprocessors are contractually required to adhere to an established set of security measures that align with industry best practices.\n\nInformation security policies & standards\n\nSprout Social has implemented a strong information security management system through a comprehensive set of policies and standards covering all aspects of security and privacy. All Employees must affirm their responsibilities in protecting customer data as part of their condition of employment.\n\nSecure support protocols\n\nOur world-class Support team follows phishing and threat-resistant protocols designed by our Security team, when conducting sensitive actions on customer accounts.\n\nOffices\n\nSprout Social offices are secured by keycard access. Office networks are segmented, centrally monitored, and protected by firewalls and Intrusion Prevention devices. Our products have no dependencies on our companyâs offices or other facilities we manage.\n\nDevices\n\nAll Sprout Social devices are inventoried with asset tags and managed with a central mobile device management (MDM) solution.\n\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA)\n\nAccount owners and administrators may require that their users leverage this additional security layer. Sprout Social supports apps like Google Authenticator and others that implement the Time-based One-time Password Algorithm (TOTP) or HMAC-based One-time Password Algorithm (HOTP) for generating passcodes.\n\nSecure credential storage\n\nAccount passwords are salted and hashed using the latest strong algorithms and approaches, which are routinely audited. No human, our staff included, can ever view them. If you lose your password, it can't be recovered and must be reset.\n\nBrute-force protections\n\nIn addition to computationally challenging hashing, our authentication services implement additional rate-limiting protections and ReCAPTCHA.\n\nApproval workflows\n\nAccount Owners and Administrators may restrict certain activities behind approval workflows. These allow for tasks to be divided amongst a team, with the peace of mind that central decision makers may review and control public-facing actions.\n\nIP restrictions\n\nSprout Social may be configured to restrict application and API access from specific IP ranges.\n\nSingle sign-on (SSO)\n\nSprout Social offers SAML 2.0 Single sign-on (SSO) for organizations that leverage this authentication service to give employees one set of login credentials to access multiple applications. Our engineering team works with customers to implement custom SSO integrations across both web and mobile.\n\nEmail signing\n\nSprout Social implements Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) to ensure emails we send are authenticated as coming from Sprout Social, helping to prevent spoofing and ensure authenticity.\n\nAccess permissions\n\nAccount Owners and Administrators may restrict access to profiles, features, actions (including read and write), and other data, by applying granular controls to users on their account.\n\nGlobal publishing pause\n\nIn times of crisis, your team has access to one button that temporarily disables any automated scheduled and queued messages from being sent by Sprout Social. This is accessible from our web and mobile applications.\n\nCustomer protection\n\nSprout Social wants to help you protect yourself from online security threats and have created resources designed to do that, including Security Best Practices and Protecting sensitive information.",

      "# [âSprout Social by Sprout Social, Inc on 2011-11-09](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sprout-social/id475307859)\nI love Sprout, I do. Iâve been using it for about 5 years and itâs a powerful tool. The app works great with an older iPhone, but if youâre using the app with an iPhone X, expect the keyboard to cover the area where you would be able to type a response. It doesnât happen all the time but when it does itâs really frustrating.\n\nI also wanted to share a Customer Care experience. Usually Sproutâs CC is amazing but we had a really weird experience yesterday. We had to reset our password like 5 times to be able to login (again, specific to the app). I donât know exactly what happened but the agent who was helping us continued to say there was nothing he could do to help, and that we were typing the password incorrectly.\n\nThere is nothing more patronizing and frustrating to receive CC that assumes you and your 4 different employees with phones are all typing the password incorrectly when the login/pass worked all all of our MacBooks. When we pushed to log a bug, the agent said âthere isnât a history of these complaints so there was nothing I could do.â\n\nAfter like 5 app uninstalls/reinstalls with all of us logged out, we finally got back into our account. I just wish that this agent would have tried to listen rather than assume we are all a bunch of idiots. Nothing worse than: âdid you try to turn it off and back on againâ when your whole team works in IT/tech.\n\nThereâs a ton of bugs within the latest update. Kicks you out if youâre not in it constantly, then doesnât open properly when youâre forced to log back in. Doesnât tag/@ properly on desktop or mobile - you have to select one platform, tag/@, duplicate and tag/@ again. Repeat the same process until all platforms are done. Their suggested scheduling times donât match the actual platforms suggested times, so youâre constantly wondering whoâs the best: the actual platform who has real time data, or a subscription based application that your company is paying $$$$$ for.\n\nThe reporting data doesnât give you any more information than what you get for free with your business accounts on your FREE platforms.\n\nYouâre paying money for a tiny bit of convenience.

      "# [What is a hashtag? on 2018-11-27](https://sproutsocial.com/glossary/hashtag/)\nA hashtag is a word or multi-word phrase which follows the # symbol.\n\nCommon hashtags include #TBT, or #PicOfTheDay.\n\nHashtags primarily support the categorization of content on social media channels, making it easier for users to search through millions of posts. With hashtags, it’s possible to track trending topics on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.\n\nHashtags are also common in marketing campaigns, as they support and optimize brand reach.\n\nThe history of the hashtag\n\nThe history of the hashtag for social media goes back to Chris Messina, former Google employee. Chris, a developer relations expert and designer suggested that Twitter should use the pound sign (#) to categorize posts for groups.\n\nMessina was the first person to use the hashtag on a social platform and users began to follow suit. It took a little while for the trend to catch on, but today, the hashtag has moved beyond Twitter to appear on every social channel.\n\nHow to use a hashtag\n\nHashtags are everywhere.\n\nOn the surface, using a hashtag is simple – all you need to do is add the “#” sign before a word or phrase. However, for a hashtag to be effective at supporting a brand’s marketing campaigns, it needs a specific strategy. The basic rules of hashtags include:\n\nHashtags must be accurate and relevant to the content of the post. Irrelevant hashtags look spammy and reduce the authority of the material.\n\nCombine branded and unbranded hashtags. The best social posts include trending tags and unique, shareable tags.\n\nDon’t be too clever or go too long. Hashtags need to be short and easy to understand. Make it easy for people to re-use your tags.\n\nUse hashtags wisely. Don’t put more hashtags than words in a single post.\n\nDo not use spaces in your hashtags. If you need to use multiple words, just connect them together like #ThrowBackThursday.\n\nIf you’re struggling to find current hashtags, examine trending topics and social influencer posts.\n\nWhy do people use hashtags?\n\nSocial media users haven’t always had hashtags to organize their posts.\n\nThe hashtag has become more popular over the years as more people have swarmed onto social platforms. With so much new content posted every day, a hashtag makes it easier to find and discuss the topics that are most important to you.\n\nHashtags:\n\nImprove the reach of your social media posts by ensuring you get in front of the right audiences and into the right searches.\n\nIncrease your chances of connecting with influencers: Using the same branded tags as social influencers forms initial connections with future partners.\n\nHashtags make it easier to track campaigns and branded mentions. With branded hashtags, you’ll see which people are talking about your company.\n\nHelp to build connections with your target audience: Hashtags are a way to resonate with the right people on social media.\n\nGive you new ways to engage on social media: With hashtags, companies often run social media contests, #Sweepstakes and more to delight their audience.\n\nThe key to a successful hashtag campaign is finding the right tags and committing to proper planning.",
      "# [What is EdgeRank? on 2019-12-17](https://sproutsocial.com/glossary/edgerank/)\nFacebook EdgeRank was another name for the old Facebook algorithm.\n\nThe Facebook algorithm determines how posts are presented to your potential customers and followers. EdgeRank and the newer algorithms use a multitude of mathematical variables and operations to measure the popularity and potential of the material you create for social media.\n\nAccording to Facebook, their algorithm delivers the content that customers most want to see. In recent years, this has lead to a reduced focus on promoted content, and a higher level of priority given to organic material on Facebook.\n\nHow did EdgeRank work?\n\nEdgerank was designed by Serkan Piantino to help organize the masses of material published to Facebook every day. In 2011, Facebook stopped using the EdgeRank system and started to use machine learning algorithms instead.\n\nThe adoption of machine learning means that the new Facebook algorithm is capable of becoming more intelligent and accurate over time. In 2013, the learning algorithm assessed more than 100,000 factors when ranking content. Since then, the level of data that goes into the Facebook algorithm has continued to grow.\n\nThe EdgeRank formula used three main factors to arrange material on your Facebook feed, including:\n\nThe freshness or recency of a post\n\nThe actions taken by users on the post (engagement such as likes, comments and shares)\n\nUser affinity – the relationship between the person viewing the post and the company or individual that published the material.\n\nWhat happened to EdgeRank?\n\nEdgerank was replaced by the machine learning algorithm that Facebook uses today, to ensure that the social channel could deliver the highest quality of content for users. In 2018, Facebook announced that it would be pushing back against branded content and giving audiences more of the authentic, valuable posts they were looking for on the channel.\n\nDespite this, Facebook continues to deliver one of the best ROIs for social media marketers, thanks to the size of the network’s user base.\n\nThe latest algorithm is very similar to Edgerank, as it still considers the “affinity” between people when determining where content should rank. The new algorithm also values genuine engagement too. This means that companies can achieve more considerable attention online by encouraging people to like and comment on their posts.\n\nWhenever the algorithm updates, it means that companies on Facebook need to come up with a new plan for interacting with followers online. In the case of the most recent update, some key tips include:",
      "# [What is crowdsourcing? on 2018-10-16](https://sproutsocial.com/glossary/crowdsourcing/)\nCrowdsourcing is the act of collecting services, ideas or content through the contributions of a large group of people. Typically, the “crowd” in crowdsourcing is a third-party unrelated to the business seeking results. You may crowdsource insights from customers and online communities, rather than employees or shareholders.\n\nThe term “crowdsourcing” first appeared in a Wired article by Jeff Howe in 2006. The word highlighted a new way of connecting with people willing to work collaboratively on a project.\n\nTypes of crowdsourcing\n\nCrowdsourcing is a rapidly growing industry with multiple subsections. The kind of crowdsourcing you choose will depend on the outcome you’re looking for:\n\nCrowdfunding: With crowdfunding, large groups of people come together to fund a project. Kickstarter is a popular example of a crowdfunding platform.\n\nCrowdwisdom: In Crowdwisdom, companies seek out the input and opinions of large groups of people. Sites like Yahoo Answers or InnoCentive allow people to share their thoughts on complex topics.\n\nMicrotasking: Microtasking breaks a massive project down into multiple small tasks ready to be assigned to a crowd. For instance, if you wanted a design for your new cup like Starbucks did in 2014, you might ask your customers to create compositions and vote on their favorites for you. That’s precisely what happened with the Starbucks white cup contest.\n\nThe benefits of crowdsourcing\n\nCrowdsourcing offers significant benefits to companies hoping to complete complex tasks on a budget. Additionally, asking for the wisdom and input of the crowd elevates customer engagement and improve brand reputation. Crowdsourcing:\n\nKeeps customers engaged: Crowdsourcing shows your audience that you value their opinion, leading to stronger brand connections. Additionally, customers are more likely to feel involved with campaign concepts, service ideas and products they helped to create.\n\nPromotes innovation & diversity: Accessing the thoughts of a broad group of diverse people allows for more out-of-the-box thinking. Crowdsourced concepts access the wisdom of groups to help companies innovate.\n\nSaves time and money: Connecting with dozens or even hundreds of professionals is typically expensive. However, bringing people together digitally reduces cost and widens the parameters for input.\n\nAttracts ambassadors: If crowdsourcing collects enough positive enthusiasm from your audience, participants evolve into brand ambassadors. Your new ambassadors may be an excellent source of word of mouth marketing.\n\nTips for better crowdsourcing\n\nCrowdsourcing is an excellent way to overcome challenges and simultaneously create buzz for your brand. However, like any company campaign, crowdsourcing requires careful planning and strategy. Make sure you:",

      "# [What is a microblog? on 2018-08-03](https://sproutsocial.com/glossary/microblog/)\nA microblog is a short piece of content designed for quick audience interactions.\n\nMicroblogging is a combination of instant messaging and content production. With a microblog, you share short messages with an online audience to improve engagement. Social channels like Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest offer popular platforms for microblogging.\n\nWhat Does a Microblog Look Like?\n\nMicroblogging makes it easier to communicate with audiences quickly. Rather than writing pages of text, a micro blog allows for quick, conversational connections with customers.\n\nShort microblogging messages appear in various content formats, including audio, video, images and text. The trend for microblogging began when social media emerged to provide quicker ways for companies to engage customers. Microblogging also keeps customers informed about the longer content on your website.\n\nTypes of Microblogging Platforms\n\nMost brands already use microblogging platforms in their content plans.\n\nAs more customers look to develop relationships with companies, short and frequent social posts are critical. Additionally, microblogging appeals to the mobile browsing community. Examples of microblogging platforms include:\n\nTwitter: One of the best-known channels in the microblogging world. Twitter is a quick and convenient way to share short posts, GIFs, article links, videos and more.\n\nPinterest: Companies on Pinterest link to products, articles and other useful information for audiences. Descriptions allow for quick content connections.\n\nInstagram: A visual form of microblogging, Instagram allows organizations to share stories and snaps as part of an online narrative.\n\nFacebook: One of the most popular social platforms, Facebook is an effective microblog channel. Users share text, live videos and more to connect with customers.\n\nTumblr: Tumblr is another highly popular microblogging platform. You can tag specific topics to attract attention from targeted audiences.\n\nBenefits of Microblogging\n\nMost companies are already microblogging without realizing it.\n\nA microblogging strategy is a critical part of building connections with modern audiences. Some of the benefits of a microblog include:\n\nFrequent posts: Consistency is key in content marketing. Microblogging allows companies to share shorter content faster. This creates more conversational connections with customers.\n\nLess time developing content: Some companies struggle to create lengthy article content regularly. Microblogs maintain relationships in between longer blog, video and infographic posts.\n\nReal-time sharing: In a fast-paced environment, microblogging allows companies to share time-sensitive information. A quick tweet tells an audience about a sale, breaking news and other crucial updates.\n\nMicroblogging for a Mobile Audience\n\n52.2% of website traffic worldwide was generated by mobile devices in 2018.\n\nAs audiences continue to turn to mobile solutions as an immediate source of information, microblogging is critical. Consumers find it difficult to interact with lengthy posts on mobile. However, microblogs offer instant access to updates and trending news. A microblog strengthens brand relationships in the mobile world.\n\nMany microblogging platforms also offer opportunity for two-way interactions. Microblogging channels like Twitter facilitate interactions through comments, retweets, liking and more. Used correctly, a microblog facilitates greater engagement than a traditional post.",
      "# [What is Doomscrolling? on 2022-07-06](https://sproutsocial.com/glossary/doomscrolling/)\nThere are nearly 5 billion social media users around the world! Yes, you read that correctly. Social media has become one of the most influential methods of communication for people of all generations.\n\nWhile there are many benefits to social media, inevitable downsides have also emerged. One such negative is doomscrolling.\n\nWhat Is Doomscrolling?\n\nHave you found yourself consistently reading negative articles or posts on social networks? This is called doomscrolling.\n\nDoomscrolling is when one decides to read depressing content and does not even notice that they continue to read such content.\n\nThe term doomscrolling has been around for a while but has increased in popularity due to traumatic events like the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe psychological effects of doomscrolling\n\nDoomscrolling can cause people to compare themselves to others more than ever. This creates unobtainable, unfair and intimidating social standards.\n\nIn turn, social media users of all ages and backgrounds have begun to feel undeniable pressure. Younger people especially pre-teens, teenagers, and individuals in their 20s and 30s can become more depressed and lonely due to doomscrolling.\n\nWhy does doomscrolling occur?\n\nResearch has suggested that people doomscroll as a means of control. There is so much in this world that one cannot control, but when and why they acquire knowledge is one such thing that is controllable.\n\nPeople believe the more educated they are, the better prepared they will be for dire situations. What they do not recognize is that doomscrolling negatively affects their mental state. Consistent depressing news will of course result in negative emotions and feelings.\n\nEliminating your doomscrolling will improve your overall mental wellbeing. The good news is there are steps you can take to ween yourself off this unhealthy habit.\n\nHow to stop doomscrolling?\n\nOne of the first steps you can take to improve your doom surfing is to carefully select your sources. Chose a source you trust and a source that has a positive reputation.\n\nThe sources you use must be factual, but they also should not have a negative bias. Often, major sources write articles with a negative lens as a scare factor.\n\nWhen searching the web, limit your screen time. Allow yourself a specific amount of time to read the content you desire and then force yourself to move on to a different activity. This will take discipline, but it’s worth your while.\n\nWhen reviewing content on the web, place effort into selecting more upbeat content. You control what you view. Reading more positive articles or watching uplifting content can make a world of difference.\n\nCreate more responsible content\n\nSince doomscrolling can have such an effect on your mental state, it is imperative that you are proactive and take steps to limit or eliminate this behavior.\n\nCompanies can create engaging and positive content with Sprout Social. When businesses create meaningful content with good intentions, people can be exposed to healthier content.",
      "# [What is BeReal? on 2022-04-29](https://sproutsocial.com/glossary/bereal/)\nBeReal is a photo-sharing application that allows users to post one photo per day to show their followers what they are doing in real-time. The BeReal app focuses on authenticity and asks users to be real. Because the app allows everyone to post only once a day, users can avoid being on the application for multiple hours throughout the day, making the app stand out from social media platforms currently dominant in the space.\n\nWhat is BeReal?\n\nThe social media application available for download on Android and IOS devices was founded in December 2019 by Alexis Barreyat. The app encourages users to share who they are in the moment. The app is the latest trending social media application that is quickly growing in interest and downloads.\n\nHow does the BeReal app work?\n\nUsers receive a notification at a random time once a day saying ‘Time to BeReal’. This opens up a two-minute window for the user to post a picture of what they are currently doing. The purpose of this is to capture an authentic, unfiltered snapshot of a user’s life.\n\nIf users post outside of the two-minute window, they will be considered late and will not be able to see others’ photo until after they’ve posted. After posting, users will also gain access to the app’s Discover section.\n\nUsers can retake their photos, however, the app will show the number of times a user retakes an image. The app also reveals the number of times the user tried to capture their BeReal moment.\n\nWhile there is not a ‘like’ option available on the app, users can react to other posts by using their RealMoji, or an emoji featuring their selfie mimicking an emoji reaction. The app has no filters or edit buttons and does not allow videos to be posted. Follower count is also not displayed on the app and neither are ads.",

      "# [What is a meme? on 2018-10-15](https://sproutsocial.com/glossary/meme/)\nMemes and social media are perfect for each other.\n\nBoth concepts are about connecting with people online. While social media is a platform for communication, memes are a way of expressing a culturally-relevant idea. A meme is an image or video that represents the thoughts and feelings of a specific audience.\n\nMost memes are captioned photos intended to elicit humor. However, there are many viral video memes too.\n\nMemes are a worldwide social phenomenon, and an increasingly important aspect of viral marketing and social engagement. Memes often relate to existing cultures or subcultures. Often, memes spread rapidly through social media, email, and forum boards.\n\nWhere Does the Word “Meme” Come From?\n\nThe term “meme” was coined by Richard Dawkins, a biologist. Dawkins believed that cultural ideas are like genes. He thought that our concepts as a society spread from brain to brain, multiplying and mutating as they went. The resulting trends were his definition of a “meme.”\n\nMost modern “memes” are cultural inside jokes. They’re a way of connecting with people across the internet through unique photos that become instantly recognizable. Memes collect emotions, ideas and actions into an easy-to-translate format. Memes are ideal for the digital age.\n\nThe Benefits of Memes for Brands\n\nThough memes are popular in the consumer world, they’re also powerful for companies too. Companies use memes to:\n\nShare information in a fun and memorable format.\n\nHumanize your brand through a demonstration of personality.\n\nShowcase complicated concepts like company culture uniquely.\n\nObtain higher engagement with their audience.\n\nWhy Marketers are Using Memes\n\nMost internet users spend around 100 minutes a day on social media. Most of our conversations today are informed by the jokes and references made online. Whether it’s a picture from a social influencer or a video from a brand, memes are affecting the language that customers speak online. This means that brands need to learn how to translate their advertising for this new world.\n\nMemes elicit better reactions from audiences because they’re tailored for social media. People naturally share memes as part of their online experience, so they’re a great way to improve engagement.\n\nHow to Use Memes on Social Media\n\nBrands using memes on social media need a strategy.\n\nLike any other social marketing plan, posting memes must be a measured and audience-specific process.

It doesn’t happen all the time but when it does it’s really frustrating.  \n\nI also wanted to share a Customer Care experience. Usually Sprout’s CC is amazing but we had a really weird experience yesterday. We had to reset our password like 5 times to be able to login (again, specific to the app). I don’t know exactly what happened but the agent who was helping us continued to say there was nothing he could do to help, and that we were typing the password incorrectly. \n\nThere is nothing more patronizing and frustrating to receive CC that assumes you and your 4 different employees with phones are all typing the password incorrectly when the login/pass worked all all of our MacBooks. When we pushed to log a bug, the agent said “there isn’t a history of these complaints so there was nothing I could do.” \n\nAfter like 5 app uninstalls/reinstalls with all of us logged out, we finally got back into our account. I just wish that this agent would have tried to listen rather than assume we are all a bunch of idiots. Nothing worse than: “did you try to turn it off and back on again” when your whole team works in IT/tech.",

It makes easier to manage multiple Twitter accounts, which is a feature I've been struggling with on every other Twitter app I've tried. One of my favorite features if the Tasks tab; I can see tasks that my team assigns to me, and vice versa. It also shows completed tasks, which is helpful. I like that it also lets you post to Facebook. I was surprised with the \"Where are you?\" feature that is very FourSquare-y; I haven't yet played with that but can see myself using it to give messages context. Again, this app is beautifully designed, which makes it even more enjoyable to use (for me)."

I’d like a suite of reminders. I’d like to set it as a bonafide alarm, send me a text and then give me a call if I’m 15 minutes late. Of course I’d like to be in control of them but this needs to be more robust. It’s really hard to remember to post at random times of the day.

      "# Decent, save for a few issues, 3 stars [(Bethelly, Apple App Store, 2018-07-14)](https://apple/2907857878)\nI love Sprout, I do. I’ve been using it for about 5 years and it’s a powerful tool. The app works great with an older iPhone, but if you’re using the app with an iPhone X, expect the keyboard to cover the area where you would be able to type a response. It doesn’t happen all the time but when it does it’s really frustrating.  \n\nI also wanted to share a Customer Care experience. Usually Sprout’s CC is amazing but we had a really weird experience yesterday. We had to reset our password like 5 times to be able to login (again, specific to the app). I don’t know exactly what happened but the agent who was helping us continued to say there was nothing he could do to help, and that we were typing the password incorrectly. \n\nThere is nothing more patronizing and frustrating to receive CC that assumes you and your 4 different employees with phones are all typing the password incorrectly when the login/pass worked all all of our MacBooks. When we pushed to log a bug, the agent said “there isn’t a history of these complaints so there was nothing I could do.” \n\nAfter like 5 app uninstalls/reinstalls with all of us logged out, we finally got back into our account. I just wish that this agent would have tried to listen rather than assume we are all a bunch of idiots.

It makes easier to manage multiple Twitter accounts, which is a feature I've been struggling with on every other Twitter app I've tried. One of my favorite features if the Tasks tab; I can see tasks that my team assigns to me, and vice versa. It also shows completed tasks, which is helpful. I like that it also lets you post to Facebook.

This is because you can't adjust the post to fit with different platform requirements. So you'd have to either create one post to all platforms and not have it adjusted for each platform (tags, hashtags, character limit etc).

They charge $25 for every additional social channel we add for clients. It is racking up very quickly. \n\nWe have used Zoho Social, Hootsuite, and now Sprout. I am tired of moving. \n\nOur workflow is that we enter their calendar into Sprout and then send the preview link to the client for approval. \n\nWe have to be able to send the preview link. This is the primary reason we went with them was to eliminate duplicate entry. \n\nI also used one once that had an embed we could add to one of our web pages that allowed clients to connect their own social channels.

SocialBee offers a comprehensive set of features that align well with your workflow and client approval needs.  \nSocialBee not only supports multiple social media platforms, helping you avoid the additional charges you faced with Sprout Social, but it also offers integrated design tools, AI-generated content, and customizable scheduling. The ability to send preview links for client approval is a feature you're seeking, and SocialBee's capabilities in this regard could simplify your process and reduce the need for duplicate entries.  \nFurthermore, SocialBee's focus on workflow optimization and collaboration, along with the potential to embed a solution into your website for clients to connect their own social channels, could be a game-changer for your agency. While Loomly might be an option, it's important to consider how well its features align with your specific needs.  \nTaking all these factors into account, SocialBee emerges as a strong contender and potentially the best choice to streamline your workflow, enhance client collaboration, and alleviate the challenges you've faced with previous tools.\n\n## Comment ID kg3ui5q with +1 score by [(yami-zoonee, Reddit, 2024-01-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/vh1v22/sprout_social_alternatives/kg3ui5q/) (in reply to ID vh1v22):\nI think Statusbrew would be a good fit.\n\nThey recently launched a shareable calendar, and approval workflows are there.

Are you an individual looking to manage a few accounts yourself, or do you need a solution for collaborating with a team? Do you need robust analytics and reporting, or is basic scheduling and publishing sufficient? Answering these types of questions will help narrow down the best fit.  \nA few tools that I've used personally and would recommend based on different scenarios include:  \n1. For individuals or solopreneurs on a budget, Buffer is a great free option that allows scheduling posts in advance to multiple networks. It has all the essential features one needs without a steep learning curve.  \n2. SocialPilot provides a good balance of features and affordability for small businesses looking for more functionality. Things like content curation, analytics, and team collaboration are included in their pricing plans.  \n3. Hootsuite would serve larger companies that need enterprise-level support well. They offer high-volume account management, advanced analytics, and 24/7 support to meet the needs of large marketing teams.  \nNo matter which tool you choose, take advantage of free trials to test the features for yourself before committing. And remember, consistent posting, engaging content, and listening to your audience - those human elements are just as crucial for success on social media as any tool.\n\n### Comment ID l424pxw with +1 score by [(Apprehensive_Salad47, Reddit, 2024-05-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialMediaMarketing/comments/16h0qx6/what_social_management_tool_do_you_use_and/l424pxw/) (in reply to ID k0efmk0):\n\\^\\^\\^ we can all plug stuff into AI text generators ourselves but thanks anyway!\n\n## Comment ID k0fdtt3 with +1 score by [(makedas, Reddit, 2023-09-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialMediaMarketing/comments/16h0qx6/what_social_management_tool_do_you_use_and/k0fdtt3/) (in reply to ID 16h0qx6):\nI’ve used Later & SproutSocial for jobs but have just switched to Pallyy for client work because it’s really affordable!

It's great for scheduling but their insights are VERY basic. It's been something I've pushed them on for years but it hasn't improved much.\n\nIf you're cool managing the analytics part through other tools and looking for pure ease of use then Buffer is the way to go. If you want a single product that'll do both scheduling and reporting, with a bit of extra work, I'd go the Sprout route.\n\n## Comment ID d43dvpq with +2 score by [(Xandaline, Reddit, 2016-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/4ncqdc/buffer_v_sprout_social/d43dvpq/) (in reply to ID 4ncqdc):\nI used SproutSocial for my agency for about 6 months and left for Buffer.  The primary reason for switching is that when it comes to posting content, it's unbeatable.\n\nBuffer is a product that is great if your team is OK with using multiple tools to service a client's social media marketing needs.  The API and integrations make this an excellent tool if you've got some tech skills to use the data they collect to create reports yourself.  Of course there are product like DashThis that fill that gap if you aren't a coder.\n\nIf you want a one size fits all tool to manage posting,  social mentions, etc.. in one interface,  Sprout is your solution.  In fact I greatly miss the Inbox that would collect all the social mentions into one place.  I have yet to find a replacement for that feature.\n\nIf you want a rock solid posting tool and a way to manage your evergreen content for near automated re-promotion, go with Buffer.  \n\nAnd, yes; the price is a factor.  I asked Sprout for 5 more profiles and they quoted me a laughable amount.  Not figuratively, literally laughably expensive.\n\nIf you do go with Buffer,  augment it with something like Mention.net and DashThis.\n\n## Comment ID d42t065 with +4 score by [(melissadingmon, Reddit, 2016-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/4ncqdc/buffer_v_sprout_social/d42t065/) (in reply to ID 4ncqdc):\n\"Hootsuite is garbage\" = upvote.\n\n## Comment ID d42w60z with +2 score by [(SproutRachael, Reddit, 2016-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/4ncqdc/buffer_v_sprout_social/d42w60z/) (in reply to ID 4ncqdc):\nHey, Megan. My name is Rachael. I love this post, great questions. Full disclosure: I work for Sprout. However, like you i've been using the platform for years. Long before I ever started working here. I've been an independent social media manager for a variety of businesses for over 6 years, but was always a team of one. I never understood how important all the team capabilities and functions were in sprout until i actually got here and became part of a larger team. For what it's worth, i highly recommend you take a good look at all the team functionality. IMHO there is very little out there that compares. Feel free to reach out to me if you'd rather. I know that didn't answer your question about buffer in entirety, but I thought I had some relevant insight. Anywho, happy to help with anything Sprout and good luck.

I think a lot of this depends on how you use social media. If social activity has to show a solid ROI then you need a tool that does the analytics and tagging well, if it's a publisher then speed and ease of use will be a big factor, if it's for customer service then you need something that can integrate with CRM and also allow assignment to team members. Currently I'm working on large in-house social accounts so not sure how relevant this would be but we use Socialbakers builder platform which looks a bit hootsuite-ish and does some pretty neat reporting, listening and analysis as well allowing team collaboration.\n\n## Comment ID d42xto1 with +1 score by [(b00mtown, Reddit, 2016-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/4ncqdc/buffer_v_sprout_social/d42xto1/) (in reply to ID 4ncqdc):\nSprout is the best.

Sprinklr beats all those options hands down. It offers power years beyond what any of them will be able to develop in the next 5.\n\nSprout looks nice and has pretty reports but it's nowhere in the same realm as Sprinklr when it comes to offering for large enterprise.\n\nWe have more than 1200 company accounts and over 10k employees managing their social presences through Sprinkler. You simply can't do that with Buffer, HootSuite, or Sprout.\n\nWhile I use Buffer constantly each day for managing a couple dozen personal and business accounts and have a Sprout account they provide for me which I use from time to time, there's no question which route I'd go if I was managing a large social project. Though if you're just a small agency with a couple clients and small social programs, I can see how Sprinklr may be too much. It's for enterprise social while the others aren't. Really an apples to oranges.\n\n#### Comment ID d43y72z with +1 score by [(b00mtown, Reddit, 2016-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/4ncqdc/buffer_v_sprout_social/d43y72z/) (in reply to ID d434zhk):\nI am at a medium creative agency with international clients. As a one person social department you have totally hit the nail on the head. Sprinklr represents the hopes and dreams of my client, which has thousands of locations worldwide that they someday hope to have all connected through the platform. In the very long meantime I am stuck running a motocross race in a dump truck. \n\nI am impressed with Sprinklr in a lot of ways, but running point on engagement makes the terrible UI stand out. Once the client realizes they need an internal team to start managing some of their social, it will get better and I will probably enjoy using Sprinklr more. \n\nThat being said, I have run very large scale social projects with Sprinklr in the past (another agency, tool dictated by clients) and Sprinklr has absolutely shit the bed on me. Reps promised what they couldn't deliver and in the 11th hour I had to rely on other tools. \n\nSprinklr is a great tool for client side social depts. I think agencies who really want to build out social should rely on a constellation of tools to get the best product. All tools promise a one-stop shop and all tools are awful at at least 1 thing (if not more). Sprinklr is no exception. \n\nEDIT: I should add that this is how I feel. This is my opinion. People can second guess my agency's roster, experience, my inability to learn/use the tool etc. but at the end of the day when I log in to the desktop or app, I am not impressed with how the tool functions or the choices Sprinklr has made.\n\n### Comment ID d435wtq with +1 score by [(PotatoFirelord, Reddit, 2016-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/4ncqdc/buffer_v_sprout_social/d435wtq/) (in reply to ID d42xto1):\nI'm also curious to know what you dont like about Sprinklr.

There is no magic solution for massive follower growth other than really engaging content, viral posts etc. Things that you likely already knew of.\n\nWith companies like this, it's nearly always bot followers, and that will tank your engagement and profile growth long term. It's just not worth it. \n\nSome of you mentioned Sprout Social, a different company to these scammers. They are social scheduling tool (allowing you to schedule posts, get reports and the like). They are actually currently the best on the market imo, so it's no wonder these scammers are trying to piggy back on their brand, like others have mentioned I'd be surprised if this lasts long. \n\nSprout Social aren't cheap if anyone was considering it, however for something less doom and gloom they do have a free resource and blog section on their site which has loads of helpful guides and templates that may well help with your social growth! (I'm not sponsored by them I promise!)\n\nFinally, the last thing I wanted to say is that while we all would love 100,000+ followers, please do not stress too hard about it. Follower growth is a great goal to have but doesn't necessarily do anything for your business on its own. I always recommend focusing on the followers / community you already have to get them to really engage with your content. Do that, and the growth will come, I promise! \n\nI'm sure all of your businesses are awesome. You don't need these scammers!\n\nPeace out\n\n### Comment ID ktf0guj with +1 score by [(Dillbert90, Reddit, 2024-03-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/159abm1/anyone_heard_of_sprouty_social/ktf0guj/) (in reply to ID kie9cg6):\nThanks for sharing!

ChatGPT recommended Sprout Social, HootSuite, and Buffer so I'm looking into those first. Prefer free options, but may consider a paid service. I'd like to avoid as much manual entry as possible, need it to connect/update automatically. The platforms and categories tracked will include Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, Amazon book sales, Podcast downloads, and opt-in emails from ads and website. I may not get them all in one, but the less manual entry the better. I'd like to stay away from building anything on my own in Google Sheets, I need this going quickly and don't want to spend time setting up automation.

My org and team is moving back to Sprout Social for social media moderation. I am curious on anyone’s experience using their Chatbot feature and workflows/processes you have. I am planning on utilizing it for our own accounts and it seems pretty useful. But, my business usually co-markets for workforce development programs and I am still working through potential use cases. My current plan is to turn on a program specific chatbot when those programs are actively being advertised on our partner’s Facebook pages. The chatbot will link them to our tech issue form/ticketing system, program FAQ page, and allow them to connect with a Human. I am a little confused how I would implement with the partners other needs in mind. For example, we work with hospital systems and I don’t want to hinder other normal content DMs.\n\nI appreciate any insight on your experience, uses, and my current idea.

Not really great at receiving criticism. \n\nNot a horrible place to work but definitely not a place you should trust your career long term.

Avoid overloading the security team with tasks that fall outside their primary function. This will help maintain focus and improve efficiency.\n\nValue Operational Work: Recognize and reward the importance of day-to-day operational tasks in maintaining a secure environment. Balanced acknowledgment of both project and operational contributions can lead to a more motivated and satisfied team.\n\nImplement a Feasible Deadline Approach: Re-evaluate the approach to setting project deadlines to ensure they are realistic and achievable. This will not only improve work quality but also reduce undue stress and burnout among team members.\n\nRevise Compensation Strategies Company Wide: Consider reviewing and restructuring the compensation and benefits package company wide. Sprout can be an enjoyable place to work, but that is not a replacement for competitive pay. Whatever sources you're using to determine competitive pay are very inaccurate. Competitive salaries and meaningful raises are crucial in retaining talent and showing appreciation for your employees' hard work and dedication.\n\nFoster Open Communication: Encourage a culture where feedback from all levels is genuinely considered and acted upon. This will not only empower your employees but also provide valuable insights for better decision-making at the management level.\n\nPromote Career Development: Offer more opportunities for professional growth and development. This includes providing clear pathways for advancement, as well as opportunities for training and upskilling.",

However, paradoxically, these contributions and suggestions are frequently overruled or ignored, creating a frustrating cycle of expectation without empowerment.\n\n - Unrealistic Deadlines: Projects within the security team are often saddled with impractical timelines. This leads to increased pressure and missed deadlines, without any ownership from leadership over their own role in this.\n\n - Undervaluation of Operational Work: Day-to-day operational tasks are consistently undervalued, with an excessive focus on project work. This approach overlooks the importance of maintaining and improving regular security operations.\n\n - Inexperienced Leadership: The security leadership team lacks significant experience outside of Sprout Social. This sometimes contributes to a narrow perspective on how a typical security team should function, hindering the team's effectiveness and growth.\n\n - Role Confusion: Leadership often volunteers the security team for non-security related tasks, leading to role confusion and a dilution of the team's primary focus. There is a bizarre sense of what provides value and what doesn't, and actual security seems to be at the bottom of the list of what provides value.\n\n - Misaligned Roles: A noticeable portion of the security team functions more as system administrators rather than as dedicated security engineers, which could impact the overall security posture.\n\n - Compensation Concerns: The salary structure is disappointing. Pay increases, including those for promotions, are minimal and fail to match inflation rates, let alone provide a sense of real financial progression. This approach does not demonstrate a commitment to retaining talent.\n\n - Average Benefits: The benefits package is average, lacking standout features that might compensate for other shortcomings in the compensation and work environment.",

Upper management promotes empathy, but only empathy for them, which is odd. My experience was that they did not care about the employee experience, just the experience of a few people.

Sprout has traditionally been unique because of the incredible inbound funnel for sales teams. Inbound has dried up and all teams are expected to outbound, which is normal across the market. However, there's lots of ambiguity, a lack of team and individual coaching, extreme pressure to hit metrics, and monthly quotas, and 1 bad quarter will put you on a performance plan, with no remorse or consideration of previous success. Unfortunately, managers are not experienced in cold calling, and sales teams' morale is extremely low. Sprout sales teams' compensation is relatively low and since most are not hitting quota anymore, the base compensation is not as competitive either.",

While I understand the need for adjustments, it's disheartening to see the lack of corresponding measures for employees. The absence of cost of living increases, bonuses, or annual raises has left many of us grappling with financial challenges. It's especially frustrating when juxtaposed with the fact that the C-suite receives annual raises. This raises the question: When will the company demonstrate, through tangible actions and financial considerations, that they genuinely prioritize the well-being of all employees? The company proudly claims to be \"people first,\" but the reality seems to lean more towards a \"C-suite leadership first\" approach. For a truly people-centric organization, it's essential that actions align with words. Addressing inflation on the employee's end, providing fair and timely increases, and ensuring that everyone feels the positive impact of the company's success would go a long way in fostering a culture of trust and support.",

You may get a stock grant, but it's just a millstone to keep working for a company that doesn't care about you. \n\nAfter a change in Marketing leadership, a decline in employee engagement, and general attrition throughout the year, there were promises made that things would get better. That management would take employee feedback seriously and implement change. \n\nThe single change was an update to the career bands structure, which is actually worse than it was before. There's no longer a competency for bringing 'business value'. The emphasis is much more on communication and collaboration, which is incredibly challenging at a company with so much organizational debt that getting anything done requires moving mountains. With these new bands, any actual work that moved the company forward and drove revenue will slow as everyone ensures they don't step on anyone's toes and risk that promotion.\n\nThe only time where you can get any change in role and significant increase in salary is during the annual review (which is held each April, a solid 4 months after the year has ended). If you just come short, or if you get feedback you weren't expecting, prepare to wait 12 more months for any meaningful salary change.\n\nIt seems like they're doing as much as they can to not promote employees or give them additional compensation. Strange, coming from a company whose Core Values include \"Caring Deeply\".",

I appreciate the investment you’ve made in Sprout over the years, and I wanted you to know that I read your review and I hear you.\n\nWe value recognizing great work at Sprout. For that reason, all team members are evaluated at least once a year for merit increases, which are based on performance, market rate and time since last increase, as well as promotions, which are based on a combination of performance and business need. Quarterly Check-ins, which we just completed in July, are also dedicated time to discuss your performance and career development goals with your manager. \n\nThe refreshed Marketing career bands are designed to provide more clear and specific guidance based on industry and Sprout standards. Business impact is incorporated throughout the competencies, on which all team members were invited to provide feedback before they were finalized. Bands are just one part of career development, and we’re proud to have rolled out several new programs including Grow@Sprout professional development awards for conferences and courses, Marketing department-wide study groups on topics team members are most interested in, self-paced learning through our ANA sponsorship, and more.\n\nI encourage you to work with your manager on how the updated career bands apply to your role and the important business impact you make at Sprout. If those conversations aren’t feeling productive, please reach out to your People Business Partner—we’re invested in the growth of all Sprout employees and want to ensure you’re receiving regular feedback and coaching across the annual review, quarterly check-ins, and regular 1:1s.\n\nThanks again for taking the time to share your thoughts. I hope you’ll share this feedback with your manager or People Business Partner, so we have the chance to improve your experience at Sprout. I really do want you to see Sprout as a place where you can continue to grow your career.",

There's so much that desperately makes me want to stay at Sprout but I can no longer tolerate how I'm being treated by my coworkers, the increasing red tape, and the low pay.

          "cons": "Sprout no longer feels like we're all in this together or we're one team working toward one goal. People are extremely entitled and more and more enabled to behave like corporate bullies. Even people I once considered friends are showing me sides of themselves that shock me. This probably is due to the fact that our leadership team feels very absent, so to make up for it, people really are trying to prove their place and pave the way for their own success, or they're so stressed they're taking it out on others. It's become a \"what's in it for me\" culture. The things that drew me to the company years ago are gone. I understand change is inevitable and I support change in general, but these issues are cracks in our very DNA, not just a byproduct of being a larger and more international team moving at quick speeds. There's no accountability and now it feels often like we're running in circles.\n\nPay is also extremely low. When I talk to peers outside Sprout, but in the exact same role, they're all getting at least 30% higher base pay, have better benefits, and earn cash bonuses. Leadership has been challenged on staying competitive with compensation again and again, and look the other way. RSUs that vest in a few years are not enough in this economy, especially when stock prices aren't guaranteed and are influenced by outside factors we have no control over. My bills continue to increase but I won't ever get a penny more in salary until I'm promoted, and even then it'll be a small bump. Overall, the company feels really cheap and like it's a pain to spend any money for needs the team has.",

It also felt like feedback fell on deaf ears, and whenever feedback was submitted, it didn't matter at all. My biggest feedback is that Support feels like the red-headed stepchild of the company. There's always this pressure to meet metrics and when you mention you feel burnt out, they tell you to have a \"growth mindset\". Whenever there are company events or R&amp;R days, you can't actually take advantage of that because someone has to be scheduled to work to meet these impossible goals/metrics. You're expected to be a team player and say yes to increasing tasks or schedule changes, even if your workload is heavy. This adds onto more pressure and if you try to set boundaries (like they encourage), you're given negative feedback. After some turnover of more tenured employees (which is telling), it felt like nothing was done to boost team morale and we were still held to an impossibly high standard.

Ultimately, it mirrors the typical experience at any other company I've worked for. Advancement hinges on the favor of a select few individuals whose opinions carry weight; regardless of your achievements, if they harbor reservations or prefer someone else, progress stalls. Often, these decision-makers are detached from your day-to-day reality. Consequently, your manager's feedback and peer evaluations hold little sway. The final decisions are conveyed with vague and subjective feedback, often at odds with the content of previous one-on-one discussions throughout the year.\n\n- pay directly linked to career progress -\nIf your career stalls, so does your salary. Coupled with prevalent favoritism, this dynamic means your earnings may not keep pace with inflation unless you cater to the whims of the influential few.\n\n- fragile egos -\nMany individuals in crucial decision-making roles have tenure rather than merit as the basis of their positions. Among them, there exists a prevalence of delicate egos, potentially stemming from imposter syndrome. Correcting or disagreeing with them—even failing to express sufficient enthusiasm for their ideas—can easily cause offense. In such instances, it's often best to seek opportunities elsewhere, as your career prospects within the organization may become limited.\n\nThese dynamics cast Sprouts' values in a dubious light, revealing them as mere illusions. When the facade of objectivity fades, morale inevitably declines. Consequently, employees tend to disengage, merely going through the motions, or they decide to leave the organization altogether.",

It also felt like feedback fell on deaf ears, and whenever feedback was submitted, it didn't matter at all. My biggest feedback is that Support feels like the red-headed stepchild of the company. There's always this pressure to meet metrics and when you mention you feel burnt out, they tell you to have a \"growth mindset\". Whenever there are company events or R&amp;R days, you can't actually take advantage of that because someone has to be scheduled to work to meet these impossible goals/metrics. You're expected to be a team player and say yes to increasing tasks or schedule changes, even if your workload is heavy. This adds onto more pressure and if you try to set boundaries (like they encourage), you're given negative feedback. After some turnover of more tenured employees (which is telling), it felt like nothing was done to boost team morale and we were still held to an impossibly high standard.

Upper management promotes empathy, but only empathy for them, which is odd. My experience was that they did not care about the employee experience, just the experience of a few people.

While I understand the need for adjustments, it's disheartening to see the lack of corresponding measures for employees. The absence of cost of living increases, bonuses, or annual raises has left many of us grappling with financial challenges. It's especially frustrating when juxtaposed with the fact that the C-suite receives annual raises. This raises the question: When will the company demonstrate, through tangible actions and financial considerations, that they genuinely prioritize the well-being of all employees? The company proudly claims to be \"people first,\" but the reality seems to lean more towards a \"C-suite leadership first\" approach. For a truly people-centric organization, it's essential that actions align with words.

This will not only improve work quality but also reduce undue stress and burnout among team members.\n\nRevise Compensation Strategies Company Wide: Consider reviewing and restructuring the compensation and benefits package company wide.

Competitive salaries and meaningful raises are crucial in retaining talent and showing appreciation for your employees' hard work and dedication.\n\nFoster Open Communication: Encourage a culture where feedback from all levels is genuinely considered and acted upon.

This leads to increased pressure and missed deadlines, without any ownership from leadership over their own role in this.\n\n - Undervaluation of Operational Work: Day-to-day operational tasks are consistently undervalued, with an excessive focus on project work. This approach overlooks the importance of maintaining and improving regular security operations.\n\n - Inexperienced Leadership: The security leadership team lacks significant experience outside of Sprout Social. This sometimes contributes to a narrow perspective on how a typical security team should function, hindering the team's effectiveness and growth.\n\n - Role Confusion: Leadership often volunteers the security team for non-security related tasks, leading to role confusion and a dilution of the team's primary focus. There is a bizarre sense of what provides value and what doesn't, and actual security seems to be at the bottom of the list of what provides value.\n\n - Misaligned Roles: A noticeable portion of the security team functions more as system administrators rather than as dedicated security engineers, which could impact the overall security posture.\n\n - Compensation Concerns: The salary structure is disappointing. Pay increases, including those for promotions, are minimal and fail to match inflation rates, let alone provide a sense of real financial progression. This approach does not demonstrate a commitment to retaining talent.\n\n - Average Benefits: The benefits package is average, lacking standout features that might compensate for other shortcomings in the compensation and work environment.",

People are extremely entitled and more and more enabled to behave like corporate bullies. Even people I once considered friends are showing me sides of themselves that shock me. This probably is due to the fact that our leadership team feels very absent, so to make up for it, people really are trying to prove their place and pave the way for their own success, or they're so stressed they're taking it out on others. It's become a \"what's in it for me\" culture. The things that drew me to the company years ago are gone. I understand change is inevitable and I support change in general, but these issues are cracks in our very DNA, not just a byproduct of being a larger and more international team moving at quick speeds. There's no accountability and now it feels often like we're running in circles.\n\nPay is also extremely low. When I talk to peers outside Sprout, but in the exact same role, they're all getting at least 30% higher base pay, have better benefits, and earn cash bonuses. Leadership has been challenged on staying competitive with compensation again and again, and look the other way. RSUs that vest in a few years are not enough in this economy, especially when stock prices aren't guaranteed and are influenced by outside factors we have no control over. My bills continue to increase but I won't ever get a penny more in salary until I'm promoted, and even then it'll be a small bump.

Ultimately, it mirrors the typical experience at any other company I've worked for.

Often, these decision-makers are detached from your day-to-day reality. Consequently, your manager's feedback and peer evaluations hold little sway. The final decisions are conveyed with vague and subjective feedback, often at odds with the content of previous one-on-one discussions throughout the year.\n\n- pay directly linked to career progress -\nIf your career stalls, so does your salary. Coupled with prevalent favoritism, this dynamic means your earnings may not keep pace with inflation unless you cater to the whims of the influential few.\n\n- fragile egos -\nMany individuals in crucial decision-making roles have tenure rather than merit as the basis of their positions. Among them, there exists a prevalence of delicate egos, potentially stemming from imposter syndrome. Correcting or disagreeing with them—even failing to express sufficient enthusiasm for their ideas—can easily cause offense. In such instances, it's often best to seek opportunities elsewhere, as your career prospects within the organization may become limited.\n\nThese dynamics cast Sprouts' values in a dubious light, revealing them as mere illusions.

You may get a stock grant, but it's just a millstone to keep working for a company that doesn't care about you. \n\nAfter a change in Marketing leadership, a decline in employee engagement, and general attrition throughout the year, there were promises made that things would get better. That management would take employee feedback seriously and implement change. \n\nThe single change was an update to the career bands structure, which is actually worse than it was before. There's no longer a competency for bringing 'business value'. The emphasis is much more on communication and collaboration, which is incredibly challenging at a company with so much organizational debt that getting anything done requires moving mountains. With these new bands, any actual work that moved the company forward and drove revenue will slow as everyone ensures they don't step on anyone's toes and risk that promotion.\n\nThe only time where you can get any change in role and significant increase in salary is during the annual review (which is held each April, a solid 4 months after the year has ended). If you just come short, or if you get feedback you weren't expecting, prepare to wait 12 more months for any meaningful salary change.\n\nIt seems like they're doing as much as they can to not promote employees or give them additional compensation.

      "# [The 2024 Social Media Content Strategy Report on 2024-09-09](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/data/2024-social-content-strategy-report/)\nSocial media users have an insatiable appetite for content—even as the social ecosystem becomes more complex. Despite AI-generated content inundating feeds, emerging networks shaking up the landscape and algorithms transforming on a dime, consumers have never been more plugged in and eager to engage with their favorite brands on every channel.\n\nFor marketers, this is a call to action that’s getting harder to answer. Without the right insights and direction, social teams face creative fatigue trying to keep up with their audience’s heightened demands. We surveyed over 4,500 consumers to find out what users actually want from brands on social, and how their responses differ from network to network. These findings reveal what kind of content social teams with limited budgets and bandwidth should prioritize, and how to deliver the greatest return on investment from your social media efforts.",
      "# [Best times to post on social media in 2024 by Mary Keutelian on 2024-04-10](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/best-times-to-post-on-social-media/)\nBest Times to Post on Social Media\n\nAccording to Sprout Social's analysis of nearly 2 billion engagements across 400,000 social profiles including Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest and TikTok, the best times to post on social media are:\n\nMondays from 11 a.m. to noon\n\nTuesdays from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 3 to 4 p.m.\n\nWednesdays from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.\n\nThursdays from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.\n\nFridays from 10 to 11 a.m.\n\nBest days to post on social media: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays\n\nWorst days to post on social media: Sundays\n\nEach social channel has its benefits depending on your goals, campaigns, content type and target audience. If you’re seeking to uncover changes to and improve your engagement, revisit your social media KPIs. Does your current social strategy align with meeting those KPIs? Of course, if increasing likes and comments are some of your KPIs, knowing which days get the most engagement helps you reach those goals as well.\n\nWhile interpreting the data for each social network individually, we consistently notice that the highest times of engagement are Tuesdays through Thursdays generally between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. Midweek mornings prove to be a successful time across most social platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and LinkedIn. Pinterest and TikTok see higher engagement in the afternoons.\n\nThere’s more to posting on social media than this quick stat, though. Each network sees varying ranges of engagement throughout the week and at remarkably different times. And when you isolate industries on each network, engagement varies even more. So even though Tuesdays through Thursdays between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. are generally the best times to post on social, consider other variables before you schedule any posts.\n\nBest time to post on social media in the UK\n\nOverall, the best times to post on social media in the UK are Tuesday and Thursday between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. Weekday mornings are a great time to post across many of the most popular social platforms in the UK including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and LinkedIn. If you target UK users of Tiktok or Pinterest, afternoon posts receive higher engagement. It is important to remember this data is collated and industry, content and goals will also play a role in the right time to post for your business but this is a useful starting point.\n\nBest Times to Post on Facebook\n\nMondays from 9 a.m. to noon\n\nTuesdays from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 5 p.m.\n\nWednesdays from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 5 p.m.\n\nThursdays from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 5 p.m.\n\nFridays from 9 to 11 a.m.\n\nBest days to post on Facebook: Mondays through Thursdays\n\nWorst days to post on Facebook: Sundays\n\nIt’s true: Facebook is still the most used platform by marketers worldwide at 89%, and by monthly active users at 3.05 billion (yes, billion). The impact Facebook has on our social media use as consumers and marketers is still ever present. Compared to last year, high engagement periods on Facebook are still within mid-mornings during weekdays and matching general business hours.\n\nOptimal send times for Facebook are Mondays through Fridays starting mostly at 9 a.m. until early afternoon, generally 2 p.m. What does this mean for marketers? Most users are taking a quick break in their routines for Facebook, making it the best time to schedule posts for target audiences to interact with.\n\nWith a solid Facebook marketing strategy, businesses connect with the right audiences with their content, whether it’s keeping audiences informed of products or sharing access to exclusive deals. Remember, engagement is a combination of how often you post on social media and what content types you post.\n\nBest Times to Post on Instagram\n\nMondays from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.\n\nTuesdays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n\nWednesdays from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n\nThursdays from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.\n\nFridays at 11 a.m.\n\nBest days to post on Instagram: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays\n\nWorst days to post on Instagram: Sundays\n\nWhere Facebook was the most-used platform by marketers worldwide, Instagram comes in second at 80%. Interestingly, Instagram ties with Facebook for the social media platforms that offer marketers the highest ROI at 29%. This is because social media continues to evolve with ecommerce and offering frictionless experiences to users. And even though the competition for short-form video between Instagram and TikTok continues to heat up, Reels still generate more likes and saves than static Instagram posts.\n\nThe best times to post on Instagram are weekdays generally between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., with Tuesdays and Wednesdays engagement times extending to 4 p.m. We recommend scheduling posts Tuesdays through Thursdays between 10 and and 3 p.m. for optimal engagement. It’s wise to test these benchmarks against your current metrics too.\n\nInstagram has grown a long way since its photo-only days. The app, which has 2 billion monthly active users, is a platform to share images, videos, Reels and live streams, just to name a few creative content types. It is also an avenue to collaborate and partner with other brands and provides a stream of revenue through its ecommerce capabilities.\n\nThe Instagram algorithm is unpredictable. To be successful on the platform is a balance of consistently posting high-quality content that will engage and entertain your audiences. That’s a lot to ask for with each piece of content published. But using that as a guiding post can help with your Instagram marketing strategy.\n\nBest Times to Post on LinkedIn\n\nBest times to post on LinkedIn Company Pages:\n\nTuesdays and Wednesdays from 10 a.m. to noon\n\nThursdays at 10 a.m.\n\nBest days to post on LinkedIn Company Pages: Tuesdays through Thursdays\n\nWorst days to post on LinkedIn Company Pages: Weekends\n\nUnsurprising for this professional-focused social platform, LinkedIn engagement times are consistent with general business hours. High engagement hours are more concentrated midday and don’t extend too far out past the workday hours. Businesses are less likely to get eyes on their LinkedIn marketing efforts on the weekend when engagement and usage drops.\n\nBecause LinkedIn content is centered around professional thought-leadership and career growth, it makes sense that a majority of audiences engage with this content throughout their working day. By midday, there’s buzz on the platform, and the best times to post on LinkedIn are Tuesdays and Wednesdays between 10 a.m. and noon and Thursdays at 10 a.m..\n\nYes, LinkedIn is a business and employment-focused platform, but it’s more than a job board and networking platform. LinkedIn provides a platform for professional storytelling and advocacy, from both employees and employers alike. Contributors of all levels can share their subject-matter expertise, create conversations that challenge business-as-usual, and uplift professional voices around the world.\n\nWith over 1 billion members in 200 countries and regions, LinkedIn is important for a wide range of business opportunities. Businesses on LinkedIn are finding new ways to generate leads, find co-marketing partners, highlight company culture and attract talent. Because of these additional business opportunities LinkedIn provides, it makes sense that posting and engagement match with the business hours.\n\nBest Times to Post on Pinterest\n\nTuesdays through Fridays at 1 a.m.\n\nThursdays at 3 a.m.\n\nBest days to post on Pinterest: Weekdays\n\nWorst days to post on Pinterest: Weekends\n\nWhile people may associate Pinterest as the visual search engine where users go to research and discover DIY projects and inspiration products, it also presents an opportunity to expand your community and brand awareness. While not all brands may be on the platform, those who use it know more of Pinterest’s benefits.\n\nThis is the second year we’re providing the best times to post on Pinterest. We’re seeing a significant shift in engagement hours this year compared to last. Whereas last year we saw a nearly universal spread across all hours of the day every day of the week, this year we’re seeing significant engagement at the early hours of the morning and lower moderate engagement midday during weekdays. Interestingly, Tuesdays through Fridays at 1 a.m. and Thursdays at 3 a.m. are peak time to post on Pinterest.\n\nIt may be a combination of when users are struck with inspiration and the Pinterest algorithm that affects engagement times, but that shouldn’t stop you from creating a social media calendar with posts scheduled at those hours.\n\nBest Times to Post on TikTok\n\nTuesdays from 4 to 6 p.m.\n\nWednesdays from 9 to 11 a.m., noon, and 2 to 6 p.m.\n\nThursdays from 9 to 11 a.m. and 2 to 6 p.m.\n\nFridays from 4 to 6 p.m.\n\nBest days to post on TikTok: Wednesdays and Thursdays\n\nWorst days to post on TikTok: Sundays\n\nAs the youngest digital platform on this list, TikTok has grown significantly and made waves in half as many years as the others on this list. With the app now amassing over 1.5 billion active global users who spend an average of 23 hours on the app every month, TikTok has competitive power against other platforms.\n\nThe best times to post on TikTok are Tuesdays and Fridays from 4 to 6 p.m., Wednesdays, Thursdays mornings from 9 to 11 a.m. and Thursdays from 2 to 6 p.m. Afternoons are when the highest engagements are on the platform; users are looking to fill their afternoon entertainment boost. However, generally, mid-morning through the afternoon (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.) on Tuesdays through Fridays see above average engagement on the app.\n\nWith TikTok trends changing quickly, it’s important to understand how trends start, evolve and influence. Once you understand how these forces, moments or signals work, you can create a better TikTok trend strategy to implement rather than participating reactively.\n\nBest Times to Post on X (FKA Twitter)\n\nMondays from 10 a.m. to noon\n\nTuesdays from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.\n\nWednesdays from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.\n\nThursdays from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.\n\nFridays 10 a.m. to noon\n\nBest days to post on X (Twitter): Tuesdays through Thursdays\n\nWorst days to post on X (Twitter): Sundays\n\nX (formerly known as Twitter) has consistently been the platform for up-to-the-minute conversations and breaking news. And that didn’t stop X from being part of the news itself on the network last year. Businesses and brands continuously look to X to participate in trending topics that align with their brand values in the process. However, due to global conflicts and vocal executives, some brands have limited their social strategies around X.\n\nDespite all this, X peak times for engagement extended slightly compared to last year, with hours extending further into the weekday afternoons. The best times to post on Twitter are Mondays through Fridays beginning at 9 a.m. and extending until nearly 3 p.m..\n\nThis extension of engagement on X could reflect an interest in developing news and updates as the day unfolds, as well as a desire for entertainment. There were also d several global events that kept users engaged on the app last year. Brands also use X as part of their customer service strategy, as an alternative to traditional customer support options.\n\nHow to find your own best times to post on social media\n\nSocial marketers can plan content more effectively when they’re armed with data. And as platforms evolve, how brands and consumers use social will evolve with them, or vice versa. Staying aware of new content formats and trends might help you reach your audience in unexpected ways, or even find new segments and personas you weren’t focusing on before.\n\nWhile you may be ready to jump in and post at these provided peak engagement times as part of your strategy, consider pairing this data with your own social media data analysis. You may discover that your specific target audience is active near the peak times we’ve outlined or hours earlier.\n\nA social media management tool like Sprout Social can help you drill into your analytics and develop tailored findings for your brand accounts across all networks, holistically and individually. Gain competitive insights by comparing your performance to your competitors, to find new opportunities for engagement.\n\nWith features like post tagging and cross-network reporting, you can separate different factors like post author or types of content, and drill down into how your posting time influenced your social success.\n\nSprout’s patented ViralPost® technology uses the same data we’ve used to look at all our customer accounts to determine the best time to post tailored for your account. ViralPost® algorithmically determines the results for our Optimal Send Times feature, a publishing option available in all plans.

So far, the only actions we have taken is ignoring for Facebook and reporting as spam for Twitter via Sprout.\n\n@reid.zura Ugh, this seems to be happening to so many of us!\n\nFor Facebook: I learned a lifechanging tip yesterday from someone in the #HigherEdSocial community on Facebook. I’ll try to reiterate here, but I just asked the OP if I can share the video they created. They did a great step-by-step tutorial on this.\n\nSo, there’s a way to automate your Meta inbox and create a rule to exclude certain keywords coming in:\n\nGo to inbox\n\nClick on “Automations” - it’s the second button from the left at the top of the interface (screenshot below)\n\nClick “Create Automation” in the upper right corner\n\nClick “Start from scratch” to create a new automation\n\nName your rule\n\nUnder “When this happens,” select “New message received” to start automation\n\nClick “Add condition” and select “Keywords”\n\nInput some of the main keywords in your recurring messages\n\nUnder “Take this action,” select “Mark as” and “Move to spam”\n\nSave changes\n\nHope this helps! It has already saved me time this morning. (Thanks OP, if you’re reading this!!)\n\nFor X: Our team sunset our X account back in August, but I still monitor for brand conversations and see these spam posts pop up from time to time. I tend to ignore or report, but it is annoying. Maybe X has a way to automate as well? I’m not sure, but hopefully someone here can help.\n\nBest of luck!\n\nI’m having the same issue, I’m so glad that someone posted this!\n\nThank you @michaelajo20 ! That is so helpful!\n\n@michelle.reddick Of course! I couldn’t believe I had been living this long without Meta inbox automations, haha!\n\nHi! Here Flor from Argentina. We experienced in private messages (in Facebook) a lot of people making random questions about the brand, but when we answer, most of them say that they never sent the message. They ask questions like, can you tell me more about the business? Anyone experienced this?\n\nThank you!\n\nThe other place on Facebook I’ve started seeing these spam messages are bots leaving Recommendations/Reviews - which of course aren’t as easily removed as a tag or regular post.\n\n@Laura Porcincula is there a way to do a similar automation in Smart Inbox? To filter incoming messages to be marked as complete and labeled as spam?\n\n@reid.zura Ugh, this seems to be happening to so many of us!\n\nFor Facebook: I learned a lifechanging tip yesterday from someone in the #HigherEdSocial community on Facebook. I’ll try to reiterate here, but I just asked the OP if I can share the video they created. They did a great step-by-step tutorial on this.\n\nSo, there’s a way to automate your Meta inbox and create a rule to exclude certain keywords coming in:\n\nGo to inbox\n\nClick on “Automations” - it’s the second button from the left at the top of the interface (screenshot below)\n\nClick “Create Automation” in the upper right corner\n\nClick “Start from scratch” to create a new automation\n\nName your rule\n\nUnder “When this happens,” select “New message received” to start automation\n\nClick “Add condition” and select “Keywords”\n\nInput some of the main keywords in your recurring messages\n\nUnder “Take this action,” select “Mark as” and “Move to spam”\n\nSave changes\n\nHope this helps! It has already saved me time this morning. (Thanks OP, if you’re reading this!!)\n\nFor X: Our team sunset our X account back in August, but I still monitor for brand conversations and see these spam posts pop up from time to time. I tend to ignore or report, but it is annoying. Maybe X has a way to automate as well? I’m not sure, but hopefully someone here can help.\n\nBest of luck!\n\nWe’re having the same issue with the spam messages appearing on reviews/recommendations and we’ve also seen a huge decline in reviews, in general, for our clients. Has anybody else?\n\nGreat question @mary, advanced plan users can set up rules to hide the message on the native platforms. I shared the steps for those rules in this Sprout customer only thread if you need some more info.\n\nI knew this couldn’t just be happening to the accounts I manage! So glad to see that others are just as frustrated. (Not glad that we’re frustrated, just glad that I’m not alone.)\n\nIn one of the newsletters I got this morning, I found this solution. I promise that’s a link to a real blog and not a spam link Crossing my fingers it helps this weekend!\n\nHi @lisa.roughley - we also have now had these spam comments coming in as reviews! I have not found a fix for it but if I do I’ll post here. Please share with me if you find it first!\n\nCheers,\n\nStacy\n\nFor a number of our clients, we have turned off reviews for now. I’m guessing FB is working on this issue because we’ve noticed a huge drop in reviews overall and in, investigating, found that review access via mobile is cumbersome. That’s, at least what we’re guessing has created the big drop in real reviews.\n\n@reid.zura Ugh, this seems to be happening to so many of us!\n\nFor Facebook: I learned a lifechanging tip yesterday from someone in the #HigherEdSocial community on Facebook.

      "# [Sprout API](https://api.sproutsocial.com/docs/)\nSprout API Overview\n\nThe Sprout API provides an externally accessible API for you to access your owned social profile data so you can use that data to power dashboards and automate your reporting.\n\nBy developing or accessing these endpoints, you are acknowledging that you have read and agreed to the developer terms. If you are interested in being a tech partner with Sprout, please fill out this form so we can get in touch.\n\nAvailable Data Overview\n\n✅ The Sprout API includes:\n\n✅ Owned Profile Data - This matches the data available in Sprout’s Profile Performance, X Profiles, Facebook Pages, Instagram Business Profiles, LinkedIn Pages, Pinterest Profiles, TikTok Profiles and YouTube Videos Report.\n\n✅ Post Data - This matches the data available in Sprout’s Post Performance Report.\n\n✅ Owned demographic data - View the data available in Sprout’s Facebook Pages, Instagram Business Profiles, LinkedIn Pages, and TikTok Profiles Report\n\n✅ Message Data - Get detailed information, including metadata, about your messages. This includes messages received by and replied to from your profiles.\n\n✅ Publishing Posts - Create Publishing Posts within Sprout.\n\n✅ Media Upload - Upload Media for use with Publishing Posts.\n\n✅ Direct Tableau Connector - Easily analyze Sprout API data directly in Tableau. For more details reference the Tableau Connector section of this doc.\n\n✅ Listening Topics - Retrieve earned media related metrics and messages found within your Listening Topics. For more details reference sections regarding Topics within this doc.\n\nFor specific data and metrics, reference the Metrics and Fields sections of this doc.\n\n🚫 The Sprout API does not currently include:\n\n🚫 Paid (Ad Account) data\n\n🚫 Listening data from X\n\nTerminology\n\nPost: A post refers to a message that was published by an owned profile. A Publishing Post exists in Sprout and is intended to be published at a future time.\n\nMessage: A message refers to any message that was published by or received by an owned profile or Topic. All posts are messages, but not all messages are posts.\n\nProfile: A profile refers to an account, page, handle, etc. on a native social network, like X or Instagram.\n\nAccess Requirements & Authentication\n\nBefore accessing the API, your account must be provisioned for API use by your Sprout account representative. Once your account is provisioned, you must do one of the following to authenticate API requests:\n\nCreate an account-scoped access token\n\n(New) Create an OAuth access token using our OAuth 2.0 provider\n\nCreating an Account-Scoped Access Token\n\nAn account's owner can create new account-scoped access tokens via the API Tokens settings page. They can also view or invalidate existing tokens (i.e. prevent the tokens from being used for client requests).\n\nLog in to Sprout and navigate to the API Tokens settings page.\n\nAccept Sprout’s Analytics API Terms of Service if you haven’t already.\n\nClick Create API Token in the upper right corner of the Token Management section.\n\nEnter a name for your token.\n\nCopy the token for use. Be sure to store this securely.\n\nCreating an OAuth Access Token Using our OAuth 2.0 Provider\n\nSprout's OAuth provider follows OpenId Connect (OIDC) and OAuth 2.0 industry standard specifications to federate identity & authentication and grant short-lived user credentials (i.e. OAuth access tokens) that can be used to access the API.\n\nObtaining a Client ID and Secret\n\nTo interact with Sprout's OAuth provider, you must obtain a Client ID and Secret using the API Tokens settings page. An account's owner can create or manage a client via the API Tokens settings page.\n\nLog in to Sprout and navigate to the API Tokens settings page.\n\nAccept Sprout’s Analytics API Terms of Service if you haven’t already.\n\nClick Generate configuration in the upper right corner of the OAuth Client Management section.\n\nEnter a name for your client, a description, and a list of allowed redirect URIs.\n\nCopy the Client ID and Secret for use. Be sure to store these securely.\n\nObtaining an OAuth Access Token\n\nNow that you have a Client ID and Secret, you can use the Sprout OAuth provider to obtain an OAuth access token, which you will use to interact with the API.\n\nYour client is setup to use the Authorization Code Grant flow to obtain access tokens. You may use the OAuth/OIDC specifications to learn how to do this.\n\nX Data: X Content End User License Agreement\n\nNote: X has additional review and compliance requirements around exposing data through the API. You’re required to undergo a brief review and approval process before you can access X's data through the Sprout API.\n\nContact your Sprout Social account representative to initiate the review process with X. After X approves your use case, the Account Owner needs to accept the Analytics API X Content End User License Agreement. This appears at the top of the API Tokens settings page.\n\nSprout API Details\n\nAPI URL\n\nhttps://api.sproutsocial.com\n\nEndpoints Overview\n\nSprout API endpoints are grouped into three collections:\n\nCustomer Metadata Endpoints - Use these endpoints to obtain high-level information about your Sprout customer account and profiles you have access to; many of these endpoints provide data needed to make requests to other Sprout API endpoints.\n\nAnalytics Endpoints - These endpoints provide information about your Sprout profiles, and posts.\n\nListening Endpoints - These endpoints provide metrics and messages related to your Listening Topics.\n\nMessages Endpoint - This endpoint provides detailed data and metadata about your Sprout messages.\n\nPublishing Post Endpoints - These endpoints allow for creation and management of posts that will be published at a future time.\n\nMedia Endpoints - These endpoints are used to upload media for use within the API.\n\nCustomer Metadata Endpoints Description GET /v1/metadata/client Customer ID GET /v1/<customer ID>/metadata/customer Customer Profiles GET /v1/<customer ID>/metadata/customer/tags Customer Tags GET /v1/<customer ID>/metadata/customer/groups Customer Groups GET /v1/<customer ID>/metadata/customer/users Customer Users GET /v1/<customer ID>/metadata/customer/topics Customer Topics\n\nAnalytics Endpoints Description POST /v1/<customer ID>/analytics/profiles Owned Profile Analytics POST /v1/<customer ID>/analytics/posts Post Analytics\n\nListening Endpoints Description POST /v1/<customer ID>/listening/topics/<topic id>/messages Topic Messages POST /v1/<customer ID>/listening/topics/<topic id>/metrics Topic Metrics\n\nMessages Endpoint Description POST /v1/<customer ID>/messages Inbox Messages\n\nPublishing Post Endpoints Description POST /v1/<customer ID>/publishing/posts Create Publishing Post GET /v1/<customer ID>/publishing/posts/<publishing_post_id> Retrieve Publishing Post\n\nMedia Upload Endpoints Description POST /v1/<customer ID>/media/ Upload Media in a single request < 50MB POST /v1/<customer ID>/media/submission Start multipart media upload POST /v1/<customer ID>/media/submission/<submission_id>/part/<part_number> Continue multipart media upload GET /v1/<customer ID>/media/submission/<submission_id> Complete multipart media upload\n\nGeneral API Structure\n\nAll endpoints use the following naming structure:\n\n/<version>/<customer ID>/<endpoint path>\n\nWhere:\n\nversion is the API major version number\n\ncustomer ID is your Sprout customer ID\n\nVersioning\n\nThe Sprout API is versioned using a MAJOR.MINOR version format.\n\nYou can specify only the major number in requests, but the full version is included in responses.\n\nA major version represents a breaking change to the API, including updates to the syntax and semantics for making requests of the APIs and the syntax and semantics of the response of the API.\n\nA minor version represents a backwards compatible change to the API, such as adding new metrics, new endpoints, metric updates, etc. Minor versions are reflected in documentation, but not the API URL itself.

You can rely on checking for current_page = total_pages in order to know when you are at the end of the paging sequence.\n\nRequesting a page greater than total_pages will return a HTTP 400 Bad Request response with a message describing the error.\n\nLimitations\n\nNote the maximum response size is capped at 10,000 results. For example, if a request with 50 responses per page is made, you will get at most 200 total_pages back. Anything beyond this 10,000 limit will be truncated as a performance guardrail.\n\nTo request data for responses with more than 10,000 results, use a cursor-based pagination approach following these steps:\n\n1.) Prepare the API URL for the specific endpoint you want to retrieve data from.\n\n2.) Define the request body by specifying the necessary parameters like limit, timezone, filters, fields, and metrics criteria.\n\n3.) Set the appropriate headers, including any required authentication or session information.\n\n4.) Set the \"sort\" field to organize the response data by \"guid\" in ascending order\n\n5.) Send an initial request to the API endpoint to retrieve a batch of data, specifying a limit on the number of items to be returned per request (e.g. 100 items per request).\n\n6.) Process the sorted response data and extract the last \"guid\" value from the response. This \"guid\" will be used as the cursor for the next request.\n\n7.) Send a subsequent request to the API endpoint. We’ll filter for posts with a guid greater than the guid we saw in the previous step to fetch the next batch of data. This request should also specify the limit and any other necessary parameters. See below for an example request to see how this is done.\n\n8.) Repeat steps 2-7 until there are no more GUID's left in the response. Each time you receive a response, extract the last \"guid\" value, and use it to filter posts with greater guids for the following requests.\n\n9.) As you receive the paginated responses, you can store or process the data as needed.\n\nInitial Request:\n\n{ \"filters\": [ \"customer_profile_id.eq(123, 4567, 890)\" ], \"fields\": [ \"guid\" ], \"sort\": [ \"guid:asc\" ], \"limit\": 2 }\n\nInitial Response:\n\n{ \"data\": [ { \"guid\": \"101\" }, { \"guid\": \"102\" } ] }\n\nSubsequent Request:\n\n{ \"filters\": [ \"guid.gt(102)\", \"customer_profile_id.eq(123, 4567, 890)\" ], \"fields\": [ \"guid\" ], \"sort\": [ \"guid:asc\" ], \"limit\": 2 }\n\nNote that the last guid from the initial response (102) was used as a filter for the subsequent response ( \"guid.gt(102)\"). Each request thereafter should continue to filter on the last guid from the previous response until no more guids are returned.\n\nOwned Profile Analytics Endpoint\n\nPOST /v1/<customer ID>/analytics/profiles\n\nThe profiles endpoint is used to query profile-level metrics for a given set of profiles.\n\nRequest Body - Owned Profile Analytics Endpoint\n\nAn example request:\n\n{ \"filters\": [ \"customer_profile_id.eq(1234, 5678, 9012)\", \"reporting_period.in(2018-08-01...2018-10-01)\" ], \"metrics\": [ \"impressions\", \"reactions\" ], \"page\": 1 }\n\nResponse Data - Owned Profile Analytics Endpoint\n\nAn example response:\n\n{ \"data\" : [ { \"dimensions\": { \"reporting_period.by(day)\": \"2018-08-01\", \"customer_profile_id\": 1234 }, \"metrics\": { \"impressions\": 3400, \"reactions\": 12 } }, { \"dimensions\": { \"reporting_period.by(day)\": \"2018-08-01\", \"customer_profile_id\": 5678 }, \"metrics\": { \"impressions\": 23423, \"reactions\": 29 } }, ... ], \"paging\": { \"current_page\": 2, \"total_pages\": 3 } }\n\nProfile Request Limits & Pagination\n\ncustomer_profile_id (filters): maximum of 100 profiles per request\n\nreporting_period (filters): maximum of 1 year per request\n\nPagination of response: pagination is based on 1000 results per response\n\nProfile Time Zone\n\nProfile daily activity uses the time zone of the native network. These time zones are the same that are used by native networks when grouping profile level activity.\n\nNetwork Timezone X UTC Facebook PST/PDT Instagram PST/PDT LinkedIn UTC YouTube PST/PDT Pinterest UTC Tiktok UTC\n\nPost Analytics Endpoint\n\nPOST /v1/<customer ID>/analytics/posts\n\nThe posts content endpoint queries for individual sent posts based on a filter criteria.\n\nRequest Body - Post Analytics Endpoint\n\nAn example request:\n\n{ \"fields\": [ \"created_time\", \"perma_link\", \"text\", \"internal.tags.id\", \"internal.sent_by.id\", \"internal.sent_by.email\", \"internal.sent_by.first_name\", \"internal.sent_by.last_name\" ], \"filters\": [ \"customer_profile_id.eq(1234, 5678, 9012)\", \"created_time.in(2020-04-06T00:00:00..2020-04-19T23:59:59)\" ], \"metrics\": [ \"lifetime.impressions\", \"lifetime.reactions\" ], \"timezone\": \"America/Chicago\", \"page\": 1 }\n\nResponse Data - Post Analytics Endpoint\n\nAn example response:\n\n{ \"data\": [ { \"text\": \"Come by for a cold brew!\", \"perma_link\": \"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-pIo1GFqyl/\", \"metrics\": { \"lifetime.impressions\": 15, \"lifetime.reactions\": 0 }, \"created_time\": \"2020-04-06T14:27:03Z\", \"internal\": { \"tags\": [ {\"id\": 111111}, {\"id\": 111112}, {\"id\": 111113} ], \"sent_by\": { \"id\": 1155555, \"email\": \"sprout.user@sproutsocial.com\", \"first_name\": \"Sprout\", \"last_name\": \"User\" } }, ... ], \"paging\": { \"current_page\": 1, \"total_pages\": 3 } }\n\nPost Request Limits & Pagination\n\ncustomer_profile_id (filters): maximum of 100 profiles per request\n\nPagination of response: pagination is based on 50 messages per response\n\nMessages Endpoint\n\nPOST /v1/<customer ID>/messages\n\nThe messages endpoint provides detailed data and metadata about your Sprout messages.\n\nRequests - Messages Endpoint\n\nThe request body for a Messages request is a JSON object with the following name/values pairs:\n\nKey Description Example filters Refer to the Request Filters section below for details [\"group_id.eq(78910)\", \"customer_profile_id.eq(1234, 5678)\", \"created_time.in(2022-01-01..2022-02-01)\"] fields\n\n(optional) List of fields to return in results. If omitted, only the guid field is returned. Refer to the Message Fields section for full list of valid fields [\"post_type\", \"created_time\", \"from.name\", \"text\"] limit\n\n(optional) Specifies the max number of results per page in the response\n\nDefault: 50, Max: 100 10 timezone\n\n(optional) Time zone — from the ICANN time zone database — used for period values \"America/Chicago\" page_cursor\n\n(optional) In paginated results, specifies the next page of data to return. Pagination for the messages endpoint only supports fetching the 'next' page of data. See Messages Request Limits & Pagination section for details \"page_cursor\": \"abc123==\" sort\n\n(optional) Return results sorted by message created_time\n\nDefault: descending [\"created_time:asc\"]\n\nRequest Filters - Messages Endpoint\n\nAll requests to the Messages Endpoint require a filter parameter; the following table details the available filter options, which includes both required and optional filters:\n\nFilter Name Description Example Values group_id Exactly one Group Id to retrieve messages for \"group_id.eq(78910)\" customer_profile_id One or more Profile ids to retrieve messages for; these profiles must all belong to the requested group_id \"customer_profile_id.eq(1234, 5678)\" created_time Only return messages having a created_time within the provided date range; accepts either dates or datetimes. Dates without timestamps are interpreted as midnight of that date, i.e. 2022-06-09 is treated as 2022-06-09T00:00:00 \"created_time.in(2022-01-01...2022-02-01)\" action_last_update_time\n\n(optional) Only return messages which have a Sprout action (Reply, Tag, Like or Complete) having an action_time within the provided date range; accepts either dates or datetimes. Dates without timestamps are interpreted as midnight of that date, i.e. 2022-06-09 is treated as 2022-06-09T00:00:00.

Refer to the Post Types table for full list of valid post_types available for filtering \"post_type.eq(TWITTER_DIRECT_MESSAGE, INSTAGRAM_MEDIA)\" tag_id\n\n(optional) If provided, only return messages with the specified tag_ids \"tag_id.eq(123, 456, 789)\" language_code\n\n(optional) If provided, only return messages with the specified language_codes \"language_code.eq(en, es, fr)\"\n\nRequest Body - Messages Endpoint\n\nExample request:\n\n{ \"filters\": [ \"group_id.eq(12345)\", \"customer_profile_id.eq(1234, 5678, 9012)\", \"created_time.in(2020-04-06T00:00:00..2020-04-19T23:59:59)\", \"action_last_update_time.in(2020-08-06T00:00:00..2021-02-28T23:59:59)\", \"post_type.eq(TWEET,FACEBOOK_POST,INSTAGRAM_DIRECT_MESSAGE)\" ], \"fields\": [ \"network\", \"activity_metadata.first_like.time_elapsed\", \"created_time\", \"post_category\", \"post_type\", \"perma_link\", \"text\", \"from\", \"profile_guid\", \"internal.tags.id\", \"internal.sent_by.id\", \"internal.sent_by.email\" ], \"sort\": [\"created_time:desc\"], \"limit\": 50, \"timezone\": \"America/Chicago\", \"page_cursor\": \"123abc==\" }\n\nResponses - Messages Endpoint\n\nResponses follow the standard Sprout API response format:\n\ndata\n\nThis array contains the message's data requested in JSON format.\n\npaging (optional)\n\nThis object, if present, indicates there are still more pages of data to be fetched, and provides a cursor pointing to the next page of data:\n\nKey Description Example Value next_cursor String of alphanumeric characters representing the next page of data, sorted by message created_time \"abcd1234==\"\n\nMessages Request Limits & Pagination\n\nPagination of response is based on the following request params:\n\nlimit - number of messages returned per response (max: 100, default: 50)\n\nsort - sort order of messages in response; sorted by message created_time (default: desc)\n\nTo paginate results: continuously fetch the \"next\" page of data, by updating the page_cursor parameter, until a response without a paging object is returned\n\nNote: Unlike some other Sprout API Endpoints, index-based paging (e.g. page: 4) is not supported by the Messages Endpoint. While you can specify the sort direction, you can only ever get the \"next\" page of data — you can't fetch the \"previous\" page\n\nA Request containing an invalid page_cursor will return a HTTP 400 Bad Request response with a message describing the error\n\nResponse Data - Messages Endpoint\n\nExample response:\n\n{ \"data\": [ { \"post_category\": \"POST\", \"post_type\": \"INSTAGRAM_MEDIA\", \"profile_guid\": \"placeholder\", \"text\": \"placeholder\", \"perma_link\": \"link here\", \"network\": \"INSTAGRAM\", \"internal\": { \"tags\": [ { \"id\": 1234 }, { \"id\": 5678 } ], \"sent_by\": { \"id\": 2066696, \"email\": \"___@sproutsocial.com\", \"first_name\": \"placeholder\", \"last_name\": \"placeholder\" } }, \"created_time\": \"2022-06-09T22:10:54Z\" }, ... ], \"paging\": { \"next_cursor\": \"456def==\" } }\n\nListening Endpoints\n\nListening endpoints are all HTTP POST endpoints. They provide access to your Listening Topic data, including:\n\nMessages - Enables you to query for messages within a given Topic.\n\nMetrics - Aggregates data across the Topic.\n\nOverview\n\nAll requests to and responses from Listening API endpoints have a similar structure.\n\nRequests - Listening Endpoints\n\nThe request body for a Listening API request is a JSON object with the following name/values pairs:\n\nKey Description Example Value filters Detailed filters used to filter the results by message created_time and network. To learn more about advanced filters for Topics see the Filters section. [\"created_time.in(2018-01-01...2018-02-01)\"] metrics List of metrics to return in results; refer to the metrics [\"impressions\", \"likes\"] fields List of fields to return in results; at least one field is required for Listening messages endpoint. Refer to the Listening Message Fields section for full list of valid fields [\"content_category\", \"created_time\", \"from.name\"] page\n\n(optional) In paginated results, which 1-indexed page to return in the response.\n\nPagination is based on default limits of 50 results 3 limit\n\n(optional) Specifies the max number of results per page in the response. Defaults to 50 results for the Listening endpoints. 100 sort\n\n(optional) Sets the sort order for results, specified as a list of fields and directions (asc or desc) in the format <field>:<direction>. [\"created_time:asc\"] timezone\n\n(optional) Time zone—from the ICANN time zone database. Timezone arguments only impact date/time-related filters, responses are not impacted and are always in UTC for posts. \"America/Chicago\" dimensions\n\n(optional) (Topic Metrics endpoints only)\n\nBreaks down metrics into discrete buckets. See Dimensions section to learn what fields work with dimensions. [\"created_time.by(day)\", \"sentiment\"]\n\nFilters - Listening Endpoints\n\nFiltering is a powerful query mechanism that allows you to isolate data within your Topics. You can combine most fields or metrics with the operators below to produce filter to specific data sets using the Topic Messages or Topic Metric endpoints.\n\nOperator Description Example Value gt Greater than likes.gt(10) gte Greater than or equal to engagement_total.gte(5) lt Less than replies.lt(5) lte Less than or equal to impressions.lte(1000) in Specifies a range. A helper that circumvents needed to use a filter with both gt and lt. Using .. is inclusive of the end value while ... is not. Dates and timestamps are accepted. Dates without timestamps are interpreted as midnight of that date, i.e. 2022-06-09 is treated as 2022-06-09T00:00:00. created_time.in(2023-05-01…2023-06-01T23:59:59) eq Equals a particular value. Can contain multiple comma separated values. If multiple values are provided, the filter returns data containing at least one value. network.eq(TWITTER,INSTAGRAM) neq The opposite of eq. network.neq(FACEBOOK) exists Either true or false. Filter finds (or not) messages that meet the criteria of having a value (or not). visual_media.exists(true) match Performs a text search query on a specified field. Multiple comma terms can be provided using spaces, wrap phrases or multiple words in quotes. Messages must match all provided terms. If you want a message that matches any single term, place an OR between terms (e.g. blue OR red). text.match(blue OR red)\n\ntext.match(“the blue car”)\n\ntext.match(blue red green)\n\nYou can apply multiple filters where data must meet all requirements by adding filters to the filters array. An example request using multiple filters:\n\n{ \"filters\": [ \"created_time.in(2022-11-28..2022-12-29T23:59:59)\", \"text.match(blue car)\", \"network.eq(INSTAGRAM,YOUTUBE,LINKEDIN,REDDIT,TUMBLR,WWW)\" ] }\n\nResponses - Listening Endpoints\n\nResponses follow the standard data API response format:\n\ndata\n\nThis array contains the Listening data requested. See specific endpoints for additional details.\n\npaging\n\nThis object specifies the state of paging for this response:\n\nKey Description Example Value current_page 1-indexed page number of the response 3 total_pages Total number of pages for the request 20\n\nA paging object is always returned, including when the response contains all data in one page. You can rely on checking for current_page = total_pages in order to know when you are at the end of the paging sequence.\n\nRequesting a page greater than total_pages will return a HTTP 400 Bad Request response with a message describing the error.\n\nDimensions - Listening Endpoints\n\nDimensions are a powerful tool that allow you to slice and bucket Topic metrics. The most common uses for dimensions would be generating metrics over time (e.g. a trend chart) or breaking down metrics by metadata such as sentiment score. The following Topic fields can be used as a dimension.\n\ncreated_time.by(day)\n\ncreated_time.by(month)\n\nvisual_media.media_type\n\ndistribution_type\n\nnetwork\n\nsentiment\n\nlanguage\n\nexplicit_label\n\nlocation.city\n\nlocation.province\n\nlocation.country\n\nHere is an example of multiple dimensions being used to create a trend chart of sentiment data over time:\n\n{ \"filters\": [ \"created_time.in(2022-11-28..2022-11-30)\", \"network.eq(INSTAGRAM,YOUTUBE,LINKEDIN,REDDIT,TUMBLR,WWW)\" ], \"metrics\": [ \"replies\", \"shares_count\", \"likes\" ], \"dimensions\": [ \"created_time.by(day)\", \"sentiment\" ], \"timezone\": \"America/Chicago\" }\n\nHere is a sample output of this query:\n\n{ \"data\": [ { \"dimensions\": { \"created_time\": \"2022-11-30T00:00:00-06:00\", \"sentiment\": \"positive\" }, \"metrics\": { \"replies\": 29.0, \"shares_count\": 5.0, \"likes\": 557.0 } }, { \"dimensions\": { \"created_time\": \"2022-11-30T00:00:00-06:00\", \"sentiment\": \"neutral\" }, \"metrics\": { \"replies\": 17.0, \"shares_count\": 5.0, \"likes\": 354.0 } }, { \"dimensions\": { \"created_time\": \"2022-11-30T00:00:00-06:00\", \"sentiment\": \"negative\" }, \"metrics\": { \"replies\": 49.0, \"shares_count\": 20.0, \"likes\": 4725.0 } } ], \"paging\": {} }\n\nTopic Messages Endpoint\n\nPOST /v1/<customer ID>/listening/topics/<topic id>/messages\n\nThe Topic messages endpoint enables you to query for messages within a given Topic. The returning data set is an array of matching messages and the requested metrics or fields for each.

Creating a Post via the API will create one or more posts on the Sprout Publishing Calendar.\n\nDraft Post Fan-out\n\nFor draft posts, the current behavior in Sprout and via the API will be to create one post on the calendar per profile on the post (this is referred to as “fan-out”). The unique publishing_post_id in the response will represent a single post on the Sprout Publishing Calendar.\n\nThe API response will not represent the single post on the Sprout Publishing Calendar but instead represent the posts as they would appear on social networks as they would be published in the future. For example, a post created with two profiles (one Facebook, one Instagram) will be represented by two objects in the response: one representing the future Instagram post and the other representing the future Facebook Post.\n\nAnother dimension is possible if the post is scheduled for multiple send times.\n\nFor example, if a post has two profiles (one Facebook, one Instagram) and two scheduled send times, the response will contain four objects: two Instagram posts and two Facebook posts, each containing the deliveries object with one of the scheduled delivery times.\n\nRequest Body - Create Publishing Post Endpoint\n\nAn example request:\n\n{ \"group_id\": 55667788, \"customer_profile_ids\": [ 2345, 5678 ], \"is_draft\": true, \"text\": \"A draft post\", \"delivery\": { \"scheduled_times\": [ \"2024-06-30T18:20:00Z\" ], \"type\": \"SCHEDULED\" }, \"media\": [ { \"media_id\": \"1234-abcd-7890\", \"media_type\": \"PHOTO\" } ] }\n\nResponse Data - Publishing Post Endpoints\n\nAn example response:\n\n{ \"data\": [ { \"post_category\": \"POST\", \"post_type\": \"FACEBOOK_POST\", \"customer_profile_id\": \"2345\", \"profile_guid\": \"fbpr:1112345\", \"internal\": { \"publishing\": { \"publishing_post_id\": 4567890, \"group_id\": 55667788, \"is_draft\": true, \"text\": \"A draft post\", \"perma_link\": \"https://app.sproutsocial.com/publishing/activity/1234/4567890\", \"deliveries\": [ { \"type\": \"SCHEDULED\", \"delivery_status\": \"PENDING\", \"scheduled_time\": \"2024-06-30T18:20:00Z\" } ], \"media\": [ { \"id\": \"6789-defg-5678\", \"media_type\": \"PHOTO\" } ], \"created_by\": { \"id\": 1155555, \"email\": \"sprout.user@sproutsocial.com\", \"first_name\": \"Sprout\", \"last_name\": \"User\" }, \"updated_by\": { \"id\": 1155555, \"email\": \"sprout.user@sproutsocial.com\", \"first_name\": \"Sprout\", \"last_name\": \"User\" }, \"created_time\": \"2024-06-24T19:44:32Z\", \"updated_time\": \"2024-06-24T19:44:32Z\" } } }, { \"post_category\": \"POST\", \"post_type\": \"INSTAGRAM_MEDIA\", \"customer_profile_id\": \"5678\", \"profile_guid\": \"ibpr:5556789\", \"internal\": { \"publishing\": { \"publishing_post_id\": 4567891, \"group_id\": 55667788, \"is_draft\": true, \"text\": \"A draft post\", \"perma_link\": \"https://app.sproutsocial.com/publishing/activity/1234/4567891\", \"deliveries\": [ { \"type\": \"SCHEDULED\", \"delivery_status\": \"PENDING\", \"scheduled_time\": \"2024-06-30T18:20:00Z\" } ], \"media\": [ { \"id\": \"6789-defg-5678\", \"media_type\": \"PHOTO\" } ], \"created_by\": { \"id\": 1155555, \"email\": \"sprout.user@sproutsocial.com\", \"first_name\": \"Sprout\", \"last_name\": \"User\" }, \"updated_by\": { \"id\": 1155555, \"email\": \"sprout.user@sproutsocial.com\", \"first_name\": \"Sprout\", \"last_name\": \"User\" }, \"created_time\": \"2024-06-24T19:44:32Z\", \"updated_time\": \"2024-06-24T19:44:32Z\" } } } ] }\n\nRetrieve Publishing Post Endpoint\n\nGET /v1/<customer ID>/publishing/posts/<publishing_post_id>\n\nRetrieve a Publishing Post by its publishing_post_id.

This media upload system supports three different means to send content to sprout:\n\nSimple Media Upload\n\nMedia files are limited to 50MiB in size\n\nMultipart Media Upload\n\nThis scheme relies on uploading a media file 5MiB at a time\n\nDownload from a Link\n\nThis scheme relies on a publicly available internet reachable file on http/https hosted URLs\n\nThis scheme is built into the single upload or multipart upload paths, and can be treated as either depending on\n\nwhat makes sense for the media file in question. See the individual API endpoint definitions below for the caveats of using one over the other.\n\nLimitations\n\nMedia sent to Sprout via this API are normally retained for 24 hours before is it removed unless used by other API operations\n\nCurrently, the only applicable use of uploaded media is to be used alongside post submissions.\n\nUploaded media must be identified as one of the specified supported media types:\n\nContent Type Common Extension image/png png image/gif gif image/webp webp image/jpeg jpg image/heic heic image/avif avif video/x-msvideo avi video/quicktime mov video/mp4 mp4 video/mpeg mpg image/heic-sequence heifs video/hevc hevc video/avc avc video/av1 av1 image/x-heif-jpeg jpeg image/heif heif video/webm webm video/x-matroska mkv application/x-matroska mkv application/x-subrip srt\n\n** Note: Although this API supports these content types, the target social networks have their own rules on media files which need to be honored. Sprout will not transcode these files into network compatible versions when used with posts. There are some built-in validation rules we enforce when a media file is used with pending posts, but these limitations may not catch every case where a social network rejects a given media file. See this help center page for details on known social network media limitations.\n\nThis endpoint supports uploading a media file in a single request or to request a link download for a media file existing on the internet.\n\nThe request format of this endpoint is multipart/form-data. The request must contain one of two request part names to be provided in each request:\n\nmedia - (Single File Upload) The media file contents in bytes\n\nThe part may contain an optional content disposition which specifies the original content type and file name of the media. Sending this information may help to identify the source content, but it is not mandatory\n\nmedia_url - (Link Download via Single File Upload) A UTF-8 text part containing the HTTP/HTTPS URL of a media file on the internet\n\nResponse\n\nA response code of 200 indicates that the part was submitted successfully. Any other status should be accompanied by a descriptive error for why it failed. Generally, requests in the 4xx code range are fatal errors that require a new media request, whereas 5xx failures are temporary and can be retried with an exponential back-off retry policy.\n\nOn a successful transfer, the resulting payload will be a JSON document containing a media_id text field which can then be used by other API calls when associating said media with post creation activities. The response also contains an expiration_time which shows how long the media will be available for use in a pending post. Any requests associating with this expiration time will fail.\n\nLimitations\n\nMedia sent directly larger than 50 MiB will be rejected\n\nMedia content that is not identified as a know media type will be rejected\n\nFor link download requests, the network request will remain open and not respond until the link download request has been authorized and fully downloaded.\n\nThis transaction trades the convenience of a single request/response with the limitation that the link download needs to complete before a network timeout in order to succeed. If you see consistent sets of timeouts when submitting link download requests on this endpoint, it's advisable to switch to the multipart upload API for link downloads.\n\nExample Request (Simple File Upload)\n\ncurl -s -X POST \\ --form \"media=@$MEDIA_DIR/$MEDIA_FILE;type=image/gif\" \\ https://api.sproutsocial.com/v1/$CUSTOMER/media/ \\ -H \"authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data\"\n\nResponse:\n\n{ \"data\": [ { \"media_id\": \"565fc90f-dd98-4c84-ab17-6f051fb536ce\", \"expiration_time\": \"2023-10-12T11:20:16Z\" } ] }\n\nExample Request (Link Download via Simple File Upload)\n\ncurl -s -X POST \\ --form \"media_url=https://my.public.media.com/my_file.jpg\" \\ https://api.sproutsocial.com/v1/$CUSTOMER/media/ \\ -H \"authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data\"\n\nResponse:\n\n{ \"data\": [ { \"media_id\": \"565fc90f-dd98-4c84-ab17-6f051fb536ce\", \"expiration_time\": \"2023-10-12T11:20:16Z\" } ] }\n\nMultipart Media Upload\n\nMultipart uploads become necessary when managing files larger than 50 MiB, or when media content is expected to take longer to download via link downloading. This benefit is traded with needing to perform multiple requests to the API in order to achieve similar objectives.\n\nProcessing Steps\n\nInitiate a new request for a Multipart upload using the Start multipart media upload steps below.\n\nA successful response here will return a JSON submission_id which will be needed in each subsequent step\n\nThe multipart media request must be completed and used within 24 hours of this initial request\n\nUpload all other parts of the media file using the Continue multipart media upload steps below.\n\nEach file part must be a sequential whole number. The initial upload is considered part 1, so each subsequent part must be 2, 3, 4, etc. until the file is entirely uploaded.\n\nThis can be done sequentially, or in parallel\n\nOnce all parts have been uploaded, finish the upload processing by using the Complete multipart media upload steps below.\n\nLimitations\n\nAll media parts uploaded must be exactly 5MiB (5,242,880 bytes) except for the last upload part, which can be any size > 0 bytes\n\nFor files < 5 MiB send via this API, the \"Start multipart media upload\" step can receive a file under 5 MiB as long as no subsequent parts are sent.\n\nMedia content that is not identified as a know media type will be rejected. This content ID will only occur on the first 5 MiB part of the media, so a failed identification within that file chunk will cause the request to fail\n\nStart multipart media upload\n\nPOST /v1/<customer ID>/media/submission\n\nThis endpoint supports uploading a media file in a single request or to request a link download for a media file existing on the internet.\n\nThe request format of this endpoint is multipart/form-data. The request must contain one of two request part names to be provided in each request:\n\nmedia - The media file part contents in bytes\n\nThe part may contain an optional content disposition which specifies the original content type and file name of the media. Sending this information may help to identify the source content, but it is not mandatory\n\nmedia_url - (Link Download) A UTF-8 text part containing the HTTP/HTTPS URL of a media file on the internet.\n\nWhen if successful, skip to Complete multipart media upload to await the completion of the link download requested.\n\nResponse\n\nA response code of 200 indicates that the part was submitted successfully. Any other status should be accompanied by a descriptive error for why it failed. Generally, requests in the 4xx code range are fatal errors that require a new media request, whereas 5xx failures are temporary and can be retried with an exponential back-off retry policy.\n\nOn a successful request, the resulting payload will be a JSON document containing a submission_id text field. This field is needed for the follow-up Continue multipart media upload and Complete multipart media upload steps.\n\nExample Request\n\ncurl -s -X POST \\ --form \"media=@$MEDIA_DIR/$MEDIA_FILE_PART_1;type=image/gif\" \\ https://api.sproutsocial.com/v1/$CUSTOMER/media/submission \\ -H \"authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data\"\n\nResponse:\n\n{ \"data\": [ { \"submission_id\": \"565fc90f-dd98-4c84-ab17-6f051fb536ce\" } ] }\n\nExample Request (Link Download)\n\ncurl -s -X POST \\ --form \"media_url=https://my.public.media.com/my_file.jpg\" \\ https://api.sproutsocial.com/v1/$CUSTOMER/media/submission \\ -H \"authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data\"\n\nResponse:\n\n{ \"data\": [ { \"submission_id\": \"565fc90f-dd98-4c84-ab17-6f051fb536ce\" } ] }\n\nContinue multipart media upload\n\nPOST /v1/<customer ID>/media/submission/<submission_id>/part/<part_number>\n\nIf the media file part uploaded in Start multipart media upload was 5 MiB, and there are still more bytes to upload, the continue multipart media endpoint needs to be called continually with each part of the media file until its entirely uploaded. It uses the same multipart/form-data structure as the initial submission URL, but this one is slightly different.\n\nThe URL contains a part number. It must represent a whole number starting at 2. This continues ascending (3,4,5,etc...) until you've upload all the data bytes of the source media.\n\nThe form's media disposition is not needed and will be ignored. The content type of this data is implicitly application/octet-stream\n\nThere are no requirements about executing these upload parts in parallel if desired. If any part submission fails, they can be uploaded again as long as the 24-hour expiration hasn't lapsed on the original upload request and as long as the final completion step hasn't been executed.\n\nResponse\n\nA response code of 200 indicates that the part was submitted successfully. Any other status should be accompanied by a descriptive error for why it failed. Generally, requests in the 4xx code range are fatal errors that require a new media request, whereas 5xx failures are temporary and can be retried with an exponential back-off retry policy.\n\nThis API endpoint has no payload response when it succeeds.\n\nExample Request(s)\n\ncurl -s -X POST \\ --form \"media=@$MEDIA_DIR/$MEDIA_FILE_PART_2\" \\ https://api.sproutsocial.com/v1/$CUSTOMER/media/submission/$SUBMISSIONID/part/2 \\ -H \"authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data\"\n\ncurl -s -X POST \\ --form \"media=@$MEDIA_DIR/$MEDIA_FILE_PART_3\" \\ https://api.sproutsocial.com/v1/$CUSTOMER/media/submission/$SUBMISSIONID/part/3 \\ -H \"authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data\"\n\nResponse:\n\nA response code of 200 indicates that the part was submitted successfully.

      "# [Report Highlights the Best Times to Post to Social Platforms in 2024 by Andrew Hutchinson on 2024-05-21](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/report-highlights-best-times-post-social-platforms-in-2024/716801/)\nOkay, first, a point of clarification: There are no universal best times to post on social media for every single brand and every business.\n\nEach brand’s audience is different, their behaviors and interests are not the same, and as such, there’s no one-size-fits-all, prescriptive approach that’ll ensure that you get the best results every time that you post.\n\nThat said, “best times to post” guides can be helpful, in both highlighting broader trends in engagement, and prompting you to think about when you might want to start your experiments, in order to find your ideal posting cadence.\n\nYou might be posting at 4pm, when 7am would be better, and reports like this can get you thinking about why that might be, what your audience is seeking, and how your approach could be cut to fit.\n\nSo, yes, I know, before you reply and comment, that these reports are not 100% correct. I know, and Sprout Social knows too, but there are still benefits to this data, which could help in your planning.\n\nSprout’s latest best times to post overview looks at the times where each social app is seeing the most engagement, based on overall trends.\n\nHere’s a look at the latest data, as it relates to the top social apps, starting with Facebook.\n\nAccording to Sprout’s data, the best times to post on Facebook are weekdays between 9am and midday, while Sundays are the worst days to post.\n\nAs you can see in the above chart, weekday mornings see more activity, with the 5pm to 6pm period, when people are making their way home, seeing another surge.\n\nThat’s pretty much the same as what Sprout Social found last year for FB, and while it may seem counterintuitive to be posting early in the workday, that, seemingly, is when more people are logging on and interacting.\n\nAlso worth noting Sprout’s specific description of its methodology here:\n\n“We worked closely with Sprout’s Data Science team to review findings and trends in social media usage over the past year from Sprout Social’s more than 34,000 customers and understand when their content was most and least frequently engaged with, broken out by platform and industry.”\n\nSo it’s based on engagement with posts that came via Sprout Social, not on posting times.\n\nOn Instagram, Sprout says that weekdays between 9am and 2pm are best, with less engagement on Friday and weekends.\n\nFor LinkedIn, meanwhile, company pages see the most engagement on Tuesdays and Wednesdays between 10am and 12pm.\n\nPinterest is also included, with the best time to Pin being Tuesdays to Fridays at 1am.\n\nYes, 1am. Why so early?\n\nAccording to Sprout:\n\n“It may be a combination of when users are struck with inspiration and the Pinterest algorithm that affects engagement times.”\n\nIn other words, it’s not really clear, but more engagement appears to be happening in the early hours in the app.\n\nPosting on TikTok works best in the afternoon, from 2pm to 6pm on weekdays.\n\nAs you can see, there are also strong engagement trends between 9am and 11am on Wednesday and Thursday, with other days seeing less engagement.\n\nFinally, on X, weekdays between 9am and 3pm are best.\n\nAgain, these are just guides, and while they are based on actual engagement rates, individual results will vary. You can use overviews like this to help in your experiments, as you look for the best times to post for your business and audience, and they may help to get you thinking about your strategy, and what could be worth trying out.",
      "# [Voice and tone](https://seeds.sproutsocial.com/writing/voice-and-tone/)\nOur brand tenets further inform our voice and how we communicate.\n\nUnexpected\n\nWhat we mean by unexpected\n\nSprout's experience means we've been around long enough to have grown beyond the typical. As a Luminary, we must be extraordinary. To inspire our audience to look at their situation in a new way. To see social differently. We do that through taking risks, surprising and delighting, and stepping outside the norms of our industry when it comes to the way we deliver a message.\n\nWhat we don't mean by unexpected\n\nWe don't mean abrupt or unplanned. Our choices are never reckless or accidental. Everything we do is done with intention—always weighing the risks and possibilities. We avoid statements that violate social norms, recklessly push boundaries or revolve around gimmicks, schemes or tricks. We do not want to be known as infamous or shameless.\n\nExamples\n\nTips for unexpected writing\n\nBe transparent and upfront\n\nShare thoughts you think your audience would appreciate because they 're not shared often enough, even if they're less conventional ways to communicate in our space.\n\nAvoid jargon\n\nOverused language often goes unheard. Focus on the value of the point you're trying to make.\n\nExplore synonyms for typical words.\n\nBreak the fourth wall\n\nFind ways to connect with people directly when they may not expect it.\n\nWhat to avoid\n\nMaking claims without proof\n\nNO: Enterprise brands love Sprout more than competitors.\n\nYES: 7 out of 10 enterprise brands choose Sprout over competing platforms.\n\nDirectly attacking competitors\n\nDo not belittle other solutions or users who choose alternative solutions.\n\nMaking statements for the sake of being trendy or to be shocking\n\nWhere to lead with unexpected\n\nEmail\n\nAds\n\nSocial media\n\nLanding pages\n\nSpeaking engagements\n\nExecutive communications and thought leadership\n\nMastery\n\nWhat we mean by mastery\n\nAt Sprout, we showcase mastery in both our product and brand. This presents as a deep comprehension of our product, industry and customers.\n\nWhen displaying mastery, we find the balance between knowledge and superiority. We never want to come off as patronizing or pompous. We know that our users and readers are also masters of their field, so we avoid hand-holding or being preachy.\n\nExamples\n\nTips for writing with mastery\n\nKnow when to be humble\n\nDon't purport to know everything\n\nFocus more on our broader customers/industry than our product/brand\n\nAsk questions to confirm our assumptions\n\nEx: Is your team struggling to use your social media management software?\n\nEx: Do you need a faster way to gather listening insights?\n\nAssume intelligence, but not knowledge\n\nExplain product and industry jargon, abbreviations and acronyms\n\nUse active voice and lead with active verbs as often as possible\n\nBe direct and confident\n\nAvoid hedge words like “maybe,” “possibly,” “potentially,” “can,” etc.\n\nDon't say: Sprout can help you __.\n\nInstead say: Sprout helps you __.\n\nBe concise (see intentional)\n\nOmit needless words. Don't say in ten words what you can say in two.\n\nWhat to avoid\n\nCondescending words/phrases like “actually,” “Everyone knows,” “just,” “never,” “always,” etc.\n\nLong and or complex words and sentences\n\nMultiple words with the same meaning\n\nUnnecessary modifiers\n\nClunky common expressions or clichés\n\nWhere to lead with mastery\n\nBlog articles\n\nCase studies\n\nProduct announcements\n\nProduct education\n\nGuides\n\nPress releases\n\nWeb copy\n\nProduct video scripts\n\nRelatable\n\nWhat we mean by Relatable\n\nWe’re relatable because we’ve been where our audience is and where they’re going. Our breadth of experience is what gives us the unique position to be relatable and aspirational at once, and we should make the most of that.\n\nWe’re the authority that can speak to every level of professional. When we communicate, our audience feels like we’re a brand who “just gets it.” We connect with our readers through personal stories and industry specific examples. We make our readers feel seen by speaking directly to them with words that they use everyday.\n\nExamples\n\nTips for writing with relatability\n\nBe conversational\n\nUse familiar language and points to make a message memorable to users\n\nEvoke emotion\n\nGet deep into the wants and needs of customers. Talk about pain points, talk about motivations.\n\nAsk questions\n\nValidate customers’ point of view by asking questions and keeping them engaged\n\nWhat to avoid\n\nToo much self-deprecation undercuts your authority (see mastery)\n\nDon’t use conversational writing to drag a point on. Make a message resonate with users without centering yourself or Sprout (see intentional)\n\nWhere to lead with relatability\n\nSocial content\n\nEmployer brand content\n\nProduct education\n\nEditorial, thought leadership blog articles (balance with mastery)\n\nSpeaking engagements\n\nIntentional\n\nWhat we mean by intentional\n\nIntention is the balance to our tenets. Intentionality when paired with unexpected or mastery means we are a business that knows what risks are worth taking. We’re concise, focused and thoughtful—we care about how every word is perceived by our audience.\n\nTips for writing intentionally\n\nBe honest\n\nSay what you mean, how you would say it in a real conversation\n\nKeep it concise\n\nFew words, big feels. Focus on the value of your message, rather than how you think it should be said.\n\nKnow the rules to break the rules\n\nBe consistent. We can stray from ground rules, but we always do it with purpose.\n\nWhat to avoid\n\nAvoid jargon and marketing cliches, consider what you really mean to say.\n\nOmit needless words. Don’t say in ten words what you can say in two.\n\nEliminate -ly words from statements, they water down your message (actually, really, simply, etc)\n\nWhere to lead with intentionality\n\nIntentionality is what balances all of our brand tenets. There aren’t specific content types where intentionality is a leading tone, it comes through in the confidence and the polish of everything we’ll create.",

I really like the look of the Hootsuite integration for creating a streamlined process for social media management. However, my team uses Sprout Social, which we love.\n\nCurrently, I created a board that has my plan that I use to create and get approval, but would like that to be able to integrate into sprout to schedule posts and see scheduled posts in Sprout so I’m not updating two apps with the same information.\n\nTo integrate Sprout Social similarly to Hootsuite, we’ll set up an automated workflow that connects your current planning board to Sprout Social. This involves using Make.com (Integromat) to sync tasks and schedules directly between the two platforms. By leveraging Sprout Social’s API, we’ll ensure that posts approved on your board are automatically scheduled in Sprout Social, and updates are reflected across both tools.\n\nKey steps:\n\nConnect the planning board with Sprout Social using their respective APIs.\n\nAutomate the transfer of scheduled posts from the board to Sprout Social.\n\nEnsure real-time synchronization to maintain consistency between platforms.",
