      "# [Sprout Social by Melissa Flowers on 2018-09-21](https://sproutsocial.com/security/)\nReliability & availability\n\nSprout Social strives to minimize service impacts and downtime. We design our systems for fault tolerance, and our teams are trained for rapid incident recovery. It is in our ethos to avoid downtime at all costs, unplanned or planned. We never impose maintenance downtime if it is avoidable—because it usually is. Elements of business continuity and disaster recovery are woven into our practices and our systems. They are not an afterthought, or a task relegated to a single team.\n\nA proven track-record\n\n99.99% uptime is a key performance indicator (KPI) for our Engineering group. At the time of writing, we had higher than 99.95% uptime over the prior 6 and 12 months.\n\nTransparency to customers\n\nTrust begins with open communication. We publicly share real-time system status and metrics on our Status Websites, https://www.sproutsocialstatus.com for Sprout Social and https://www.sproutadvocacystatus.com for Employee Advocacy. There we communicate incidents and planned maintenance, including any customer impact, and we display system health metrics sourced from independent third-party providers. Customers may subscribe to receive immediate SMS or email notifications of future incidents.\n\nSocial media feeds\n\nOur data ingest layer combines multiple connections to social network APIs. As partners, social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn provide us with higher levels of redundancy and access to their support teams.\n\nBackups\n\nBackups are taken frequently, encrypted in transit and at rest, and are tested regularly. Backups are kept \"off-site\" in Amazon S3 which stores files on multiple physical devices in multiple facilities offering 99.999999999% durability and 99.99% availability.\n\nTransparency to our teams\n\nInternally we practice multidisciplinary, blameless post-mortem analysis, and seek to grow our people, procedures, and systems in the aftermath of failure. Fear is the enemy of progress.\n\nIsolation\n\nOur highly distributed backend platform employs isolation design patterns to mitigate risks across components. Failures of one component rarely affect other components.\n\nRecovery point objectives (RPOs)\n\nRecovery strategies are designed to provide up-to-date RPOs at low Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs), with older data recovered against longer RTOs. This is consistent with customer expectations in Social Media, allowing customers to meet the immediate needs of their customers.\n\nDevOps best practices\n\nOur engineering team practices Infrastructure-as-code, providing correctness, consistency, testability, and speed to recovery. All 24/7/365 on-call team members are empowered to rebuild systems and topologies with full consistency. In the event of system loss, our Engineering team quickly recreates systems by executing the infrastructure code.\n\nMonitoring & on-call support\n\nWe monitor continuously from around the world, displaying, alerting, and reporting upon our entire technical environments in real-time. Supporting customers is a collaboration between our customer-facing support team and our engineering team. Specialized engineers are on call 24/7/365.\n\nWhen problems occur our teams are promptly notified, automatically provided with context, and are enabled with tools to help collaborate efficiently with peers. We employ a triage pager system to ensure alerts quickly and reliably reach engineers.\n\nEncryption at rest & in transit\n\nAll communications over public networks with Sprout Social’s application and API utilize HTTPS with TLS 1.2 or higher enforced. All data is stored encrypted-at-rest with AES-256 or greater, including backups.\n\nSystem administration\n\nBest practices are utilized, such as least privilege, central configuration management, and stringent host and network firewall policies. Servers are patched automatically on a regular schedule, with high-priority patches applied manually out-of-cycle.\n\nThird party risk management\n\nSprout Social reviews the security posture of our critical third party product and service providers on a regular basis. Sprout Social's subprocessors are contractually required to adhere to an established set of security measures that align with industry best practices.\n\nInformation security policies & standards\n\nSprout Social has implemented a strong information security management system through a comprehensive set of policies and standards covering all aspects of security and privacy. All Employees must affirm their responsibilities in protecting customer data as part of their condition of employment.\n\nSecure support protocols\n\nOur world-class Support team follows phishing and threat-resistant protocols designed by our Security team, when conducting sensitive actions on customer accounts.\n\nOffices\n\nSprout Social offices are secured by keycard access. Office networks are segmented, centrally monitored, and protected by firewalls and Intrusion Prevention devices. Our products have no dependencies on our company’s offices or other facilities we manage.\n\nDevices\n\nAll Sprout Social devices are inventoried with asset tags and managed with a central mobile device management (MDM) solution.\n\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA)\n\nAccount owners and administrators may require that their users leverage this additional security layer. Sprout Social supports apps like Google Authenticator and others that implement the Time-based One-time Password Algorithm (TOTP) or HMAC-based One-time Password Algorithm (HOTP) for generating passcodes.\n\nSecure credential storage\n\nAccount passwords are salted and hashed using the latest strong algorithms and approaches, which are routinely audited. No human, our staff included, can ever view them. If you lose your password, it can't be recovered and must be reset.\n\nBrute-force protections\n\nIn addition to computationally challenging hashing, our authentication services implement additional rate-limiting protections and ReCAPTCHA.\n\nApproval workflows\n\nAccount Owners and Administrators may restrict certain activities behind approval workflows. These allow for tasks to be divided amongst a team, with the peace of mind that central decision makers may review and control public-facing actions.\n\nIP restrictions\n\nSprout Social may be configured to restrict application and API access from specific IP ranges.\n\nSingle sign-on (SSO)\n\nSprout Social offers SAML 2.0 Single sign-on (SSO) for organizations that leverage this authentication service to give employees one set of login credentials to access multiple applications. Our engineering team works with customers to implement custom SSO integrations across both web and mobile.\n\nEmail signing\n\nSprout Social implements Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) to ensure emails we send are authenticated as coming from Sprout Social, helping to prevent spoofing and ensure authenticity.\n\nAccess permissions\n\nAccount Owners and Administrators may restrict access to profiles, features, actions (including read and write), and other data, by applying granular controls to users on their account.\n\nGlobal publishing pause\n\nIn times of crisis, your team has access to one button that temporarily disables any automated scheduled and queued messages from being sent by Sprout Social. This is accessible from our web and mobile applications.\n\nCustomer protection\n\nSprout Social wants to help you protect yourself from online security threats and have created resources designed to do that, including Security Best Practices and Protecting sensitive information.",

      "# [What is EdgeRank? on 2019-12-17](https://sproutsocial.com/glossary/edgerank/)\nFacebook EdgeRank was another name for the old Facebook algorithm.\n\nThe Facebook algorithm determines how posts are presented to your potential customers and followers. EdgeRank and the newer algorithms use a multitude of mathematical variables and operations to measure the popularity and potential of the material you create for social media.\n\nAccording to Facebook, their algorithm delivers the content that customers most want to see. In recent years, this has lead to a reduced focus on promoted content, and a higher level of priority given to organic material on Facebook.\n\nHow did EdgeRank work?\n\nEdgerank was designed by Serkan Piantino to help organize the masses of material published to Facebook every day. In 2011, Facebook stopped using the EdgeRank system and started to use machine learning algorithms instead.\n\nThe adoption of machine learning means that the new Facebook algorithm is capable of becoming more intelligent and accurate over time. In 2013, the learning algorithm assessed more than 100,000 factors when ranking content. Since then, the level of data that goes into the Facebook algorithm has continued to grow.\n\nThe EdgeRank formula used three main factors to arrange material on your Facebook feed, including:\n\nThe freshness or recency of a post\n\nThe actions taken by users on the post (engagement such as likes, comments and shares)\n\nUser affinity – the relationship between the person viewing the post and the company or individual that published the material.\n\nWhat happened to EdgeRank?\n\nEdgerank was replaced by the machine learning algorithm that Facebook uses today, to ensure that the social channel could deliver the highest quality of content for users. In 2018, Facebook announced that it would be pushing back against branded content and giving audiences more of the authentic, valuable posts they were looking for on the channel.\n\nDespite this, Facebook continues to deliver one of the best ROIs for social media marketers, thanks to the size of the network’s user base.\n\nThe latest algorithm is very similar to Edgerank, as it still considers the “affinity” between people when determining where content should rank. The new algorithm also values genuine engagement too. This means that companies can achieve more considerable attention online by encouraging people to like and comment on their posts.\n\nWhenever the algorithm updates, it means that companies on Facebook need to come up with a new plan for interacting with followers online. In the case of the most recent update, some key tips include:",

      "# Post ID 15h37qg: Looking for alternatives for Sprout Social with +5 score by [(mr_meeseks97, Reddit, 2023-08-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/digital_marketing/comments/15h37qg/looking_for_alternatives_for_sprout_social/)\nI've been using Sprout Social at work to have one place where all the Social mentions, messages and also keyword mentions come in so I can see everything connected to the brand AND can also schedule & post content from one place.  \n\n\nNow Sprout is increasing the price and I've been asked to look out for better and cheaper alternatives. Which tools are you using? Are there any good alternatives or is Sprout the best in the field?\n\n## Comment ID jurkfla with +3 score by [(jmcorey27, Reddit, 2023-08-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/digital_marketing/comments/15h37qg/looking_for_alternatives_for_sprout_social/jurkfla/) (in reply to ID 15h37qg):\nSocialBee 🐝\n\n### Comment ID jusozmn with +1 score by [(mr_meeseks97, Reddit, 2023-08-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/digital_marketing/comments/15h37qg/looking_for_alternatives_for_sprout_social/jusozmn/) (in reply to ID jurkfla):\nAre you happy with it?

I think it's very similar to sprout though, just a bit cheaper. However I do work for a massive global company with big brands so we're probably getting a good deal.

It also shows benchmarking and has a good Instagram competitor benchmarking (although I wish they had this for all platforms!) \n\nI don't like the main post crafting section compared to sprout social or loomly. This is because you can't adjust the post to fit with different platform requirements. So you'd have to either create one post to all platforms and not have it adjusted for each platform (tags, hashtags, character limit etc). OR create the same post 3 or 4 times over for different platforms.\n\nWith other tools I've used you can individually tweak within the one post. I hope that makes sense?\n\n## Comment ID jx6ftdi with +2 score by [(ShivamGun, Reddit, 2023-08-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/digital_marketing/comments/15h37qg/looking_for_alternatives_for_sprout_social/jx6ftdi/) (in reply to ID 15h37qg):\nSprout is an exhaustive tool so regular scheduling platforms would fall short.

I’ve got a comparison chart already made but I want to hear from other social media professionals on what service you’re using and what you like/dislike about it. \n\nI’ve been using brandwatch (falcon) for the last several years and can’t justify the costs anymore with so many new providers coming out.

It’s such a bummer. I’ve asked this a couple times too. Most of the answers if you search the thread are dated. \n\nI also have a comparison chart, and I’m lukewarm on all the things I’ve tried. IMO none are all encompassing with the things I need and also affordable. It’s the tiny things that really irritate me about the management tools, like not being able to schedule a story or tag a photo. I do realize Meta (ugh) locks some of this down as well. \n\nI find that Hootsuite, Sprout, Buffer are all basically the same so it just comes down to preference and price.\n\n### Comment ID k0b1n6x with +3 score by [(beansauer, Reddit, 2023-09-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialMediaMarketing/comments/16h0qx6/what_social_management_tool_do_you_use_and/k0b1n6x/) (in reply to ID k0azsu6):\nI appreciate the feedback and hear you on the similarity point.

I’m liking it a lot so far. I did some comparison “shopping,” but I’m pretty sure I’m gonna stick with it. Their basic plan (which does most of what I need) is free. Their next level up (which I will probably switch to in a few months) is very affordable. Especially compared to the other products I looked at which were like 3-5x more expensive.

Are you an individual looking to manage a few accounts yourself, or do you need a solution for collaborating with a team? Do you need robust analytics and reporting, or is basic scheduling and publishing sufficient? Answering these types of questions will help narrow down the best fit.  \nA few tools that I've used personally and would recommend based on different scenarios include:  \n1. For individuals or solopreneurs on a budget, Buffer is a great free option that allows scheduling posts in advance to multiple networks. It has all the essential features one needs without a steep learning curve.  \n2. SocialPilot provides a good balance of features and affordability for small businesses looking for more functionality. Things like content curation, analytics, and team collaboration are included in their pricing plans.  \n3. Hootsuite would serve larger companies that need enterprise-level support well. They offer high-volume account management, advanced analytics, and 24/7 support to meet the needs of large marketing teams.  \nNo matter which tool you choose, take advantage of free trials to test the features for yourself before committing. And remember, consistent posting, engaging content, and listening to your audience - those human elements are just as crucial for success on social media as any tool.\n\n### Comment ID l424pxw with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-05-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialMediaMarketing/comments/16h0qx6/what_social_management_tool_do_you_use_and/l424pxw/) (in reply to ID k0efmk0):\n\\^\\^\\^ we can all plug stuff into AI text generators ourselves but thanks anyway!\n\n## Comment ID k0fdtt3 with +1 score by [(makedas, Reddit, 2023-09-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialMediaMarketing/comments/16h0qx6/what_social_management_tool_do_you_use_and/k0fdtt3/) (in reply to ID 16h0qx6):\nI’ve used Later & SproutSocial for jobs but have just switched to Pallyy for client work because it’s really affordable!

It's been something I've pushed them on for years but it hasn't improved much.\n\nIf you're cool managing the analytics part through other tools and looking for pure ease of use then Buffer is the way to go.

The primary reason for switching is that when it comes to posting content, it's unbeatable.\n\nBuffer is a product that is great if your team is OK with using multiple tools to service a client's social media marketing needs.  The API and integrations make this an excellent tool if you've got some tech skills to use the data they collect to create reports yourself.  Of course there are product like DashThis that fill that gap if you aren't a coder.\n\nIf you want a one size fits all tool to manage posting,  social mentions, etc.. in one interface,  Sprout is your solution.  In fact I greatly miss the Inbox that would collect all the social mentions into one place.  I have yet to find a replacement for that feature.\n\nIf you want a rock solid posting tool and a way to manage your evergreen content for near automated re-promotion, go with Buffer.  \n\nAnd, yes; the price is a factor.  I asked Sprout for 5 more profiles and they quoted me a laughable amount.  Not figuratively, literally laughably expensive.\n\nIf you do go with Buffer,  augment it with something like Mention.net and DashThis.\n\n## Comment ID d42t065 with +3 score by [(melissadingmon, Reddit, 2016-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/4ncqdc/buffer_v_sprout_social/d42t065/) (in reply to ID 4ncqdc):\n\"Hootsuite is garbage\" = upvote.\n\n## Comment ID d42w60z with +2 score by [(SproutRachael, Reddit, 2016-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/4ncqdc/buffer_v_sprout_social/d42w60z/) (in reply to ID 4ncqdc):\nHey, Megan.

I never understood how important all the team capabilities and functions were in sprout until i actually got here and became part of a larger team.

I think a lot of this depends on how you use social media. If social activity has to show a solid ROI then you need a tool that does the analytics and tagging well, if it's a publisher then speed and ease of use will be a big factor, if it's for customer service then you need something that can integrate with CRM and also allow assignment to team members.

Sprinklr beats all those options hands down. It offers power years beyond what any of them will be able to develop in the next 5.\n\nSprout looks nice and has pretty reports but it's nowhere in the same realm as Sprinklr when it comes to offering for large enterprise.\n\nWe have more than 1200 company accounts and over 10k employees managing their social presences through Sprinkler. You simply can't do that with Buffer, HootSuite, or Sprout.\n\nWhile I use Buffer constantly each day for managing a couple dozen personal and business accounts and have a Sprout account they provide for me which I use from time to time, there's no question which route I'd go if I was managing a large social project. Though if you're just a small agency with a couple clients and small social programs, I can see how Sprinklr may be too much. It's for enterprise social while the others aren't. Really an apples to oranges.\n\n#### Comment ID d43y72z with +1 score by [(b00mtown, Reddit, 2016-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/4ncqdc/buffer_v_sprout_social/d43y72z/) (in reply to ID d434zhk):\nI am at a medium creative agency with international clients. As a one person social department you have totally hit the nail on the head. Sprinklr represents the hopes and dreams of my client, which has thousands of locations worldwide that they someday hope to have all connected through the platform. In the very long meantime I am stuck running a motocross race in a dump truck. \n\nI am impressed with Sprinklr in a lot of ways, but running point on engagement makes the terrible UI stand out. Once the client realizes they need an internal team to start managing some of their social, it will get better and I will probably enjoy using Sprinklr more. \n\nThat being said, I have run very large scale social projects with Sprinklr in the past (another agency, tool dictated by clients) and Sprinklr has absolutely shit the bed on me. Reps promised what they couldn't deliver and in the 11th hour I had to rely on other tools. \n\nSprinklr is a great tool for client side social depts. I think agencies who really want to build out social should rely on a constellation of tools to get the best product. All tools promise a one-stop shop and all tools are awful at at least 1 thing (if not more). Sprinklr is no exception. \n\nEDIT: I should add that this is how I feel. This is my opinion. People can second guess my agency's roster, experience, my inability to learn/use the tool etc. but at the end of the day when I log in to the desktop or app, I am not impressed with how the tool functions or the choices Sprinklr has made.\n\n### Comment ID d435wtq with +1 score by [(PotatoFirelord, Reddit, 2016-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/4ncqdc/buffer_v_sprout_social/d435wtq/) (in reply to ID d42xto1):\nI'm also curious to know what you dont like about Sprinklr.

Maybe you've solved the issue? Posting regularly from a verified account until two weeks ago, and now we are \"restricted\" but not according to Meta or Instagram in their apps or Meta Business. If you solved this issue, please let me know how you did it.\n\n## Comment ID kbao14r with +2 score by [(Bubbiedunited, Reddit, 2023-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialMediaMarketing/comments/186c0ef/rejected_sprout_posts_on_instagram/kbao14r/) (in reply to ID 186c0ef):\nLove and hate relationship here with Sprout lol. Best I can say is to occasionally disconnect and reconnect the profiles (as long as you don’t have TONS scheduled since it will remove those posts once disconnected.) Also, Meta tends to flag third party scheduling platforms which is SO annoying. Just a couple of weeks ago we had to wait a week to get access to several client accounts because they had been deactivated. All Meta had to say was “be careful using third party software.” 🤦\n\n### Comment ID kbbj0zx with +1 score by [(Due-Candidate, Reddit, 2023-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialMediaMarketing/comments/186c0ef/rejected_sprout_posts_on_instagram/kbbj0zx/) (in reply to ID kbao14r):\nThanks for replying. We had several Sprout initiated reconnects with no result, and then a long stretch of replies promising to \"keep us updated\" while they worked with Meta. After over 2 weeks of nothing, including a weird interaction with Meta support where the ticket came back as \"This post was removed, and this issue is resolved.\" with no post referenced, I went into Meta Business and disconnected and reconnected the Instagram account there. It changed nothing display-wise, but our posting started working again. And Sprout reminded us about their no refunds policy regarding API issues.   \n\n\nTwo weeks ago, someone could have suggested what I did this morning. The layers on Meta Business or deep - I wouldn't have tried it without digging in desperation, but I would have tried it immediately with the simple suggestion from the support team. A little disappointing. And now I have added the hate side to my previous love relationship with Sprout. lol.\n\n### Comment ID kbc87jq with +1 score by [(Bubbiedunited, Reddit, 2023-11-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialMediaMarketing/comments/186c0ef/rejected_sprout_posts_on_instagram/kbc87jq/) (in reply to ID kbao14r):\nYes, I’m always paranoid now and double and triple check that everything I schedule actually did go live because posts will fail for no reason whatsoever",

Later is fantastic, easy to use interface and very reasonably priced.\n\n## Comment ID jo8cdoj with +1 score by [(StraightUpScotch, Reddit, 2023-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/148sq4f/what_social_media_management_app_are_you_using/jo8cdoj/) (in reply to ID 148sq4f):\nI use Buffer to schedule things for LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook. But like many of these tools, it has its limitations. \n\n- You cannot schedule LinkedIn carousels. (I use LinkedIn's scheduler for this.)\n- Formatting Twitter threads is really difficult. I use Typefully to format these as it's much easier.\n\n## Comment ID jo8zfab with +1 score by [(I_talk_insurance, Reddit, 2023-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/148sq4f/what_social_media_management_app_are_you_using/jo8zfab/) (in reply to ID 148sq4f):\nI am using Buffer for mine. It's pretty simple to use. Got the analytics. You can schedule Insta stories as well.\n\n### Comment ID josw0mm with +1 score by [(OhcmonMama, Reddit, 2023-06-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/148sq4f/what_social_media_management_app_are_you_using/josw0mm/) (in reply to ID jo8zfab):\nWow there has been a lot of recommendations for Buffer\n\n## Comment ID jpej7n6 with +1 score by [(sokratus, Reddit, 2023-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/148sq4f/what_social_media_management_app_are_you_using/jpej7n6/) (in reply to ID 148sq4f):\nWhy do all these recommended apps look like they were built in the late 2000s? I think Tailwindapp is one of the decent ones, but it's not robust for sure.\n\n## Comment ID k13utv7 with +1 score by [(RevolutionaryTea3920, Reddit, 2023-09-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/148sq4f/what_social_media_management_app_are_you_using/k13utv7/) (in reply to ID 148sq4f):\nSay goodbye to the hassle of managing multiple accounts on different devices. SocialSmartly can help you manage all your accounts on one device.\n\n## Comment ID k3qok2n with +1 score by [(serbalhakau, Reddit, 2023-10-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/148sq4f/what_social_media_management_app_are_you_using/k3qok2n/) (in reply to ID 148sq4f):\nJust started using Synup Social this month on a free trial, and I'm definitely taking the plunge\n\nI've used Hootsuite, Buffer, and Sprout and they just don't compare\n\n## Comment ID kgfvvxi with +1 score by [(3ASYW1N, Reddit, 2024-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/148sq4f/what_social_media_management_app_are_you_using/kgfvvxi/) (in reply to ID 148sq4f):\nNot sure if you’ve found something or not yet. I was in a similar boat and wasting a ton of time manually doing this process. I tried out several on the market and settled with Synup Social as it had the best user interface. Easy to use and it saved me a ton of of time for scheduling posts and provided engagement insights.\n\n## Comment ID kr9lg4e with +1 score by [(its_umar_khann, Reddit, 2024-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/148sq4f/what_social_media_management_app_are_you_using/kr9lg4e/) (in reply to ID 148sq4f):\nGive SocialBu a try. It supports FB, Insta, X, LinkedIn, GMB, Mastodon, TikTok, YouTube and Reddit. \n\nI am co-creator of this tool. Happy to answer any questions :)"

The current CEO is in over his head, constantly has to course correct because he forgets that he's not just talking to sales people (\"win every deal\" morphing into \"win every customer\") to be honest, just gives off too much sales bro vibes compared to our previous CEO who I think was much more down to earth. \n\nStop hiring new senior leadership bringing ideas that only work for companies 10x our size with 10x the number of people in R&amp;D. We're just too small to introduce these really elaborate ways of working like stacked ranked priorities, workstreams, phase gates, etc. This is going to create a more political environment and encourage turf building in those who have been hired from companies like Amazon where that is encouraged. \n\nThere is no way you are going to be able to hire all of these new VPs of product management in any reasonable amount of time to fill all of these new positions you created after decimating the existing product management org. Bring back the senior PMs and let them grow into the roles you need. \n\nThe cynical side of me says the difficulty filling these positions and the promised new platform engineer positions is a feature, not a bug to not spend any more money but make it look like we're doing okay as a company with all of these open positions. This is the classic definition of \"ghost job\".",

          "cons": "- Sprout values and culture are more of a vibe than \"this is how we work\". This is an effort ongoing to relaunch the values next year but I am suspicious that this is going to be a \"rules for thee, not for me\" especially after how the 10% R&amp;D layoffs were handled (laying people off by email is pretty low). \n- Most leadership have not had much experience outside of Sprout, let alone a company as large as Sprout so there is a lot of on the job training going on which explains how the transition to focusing on enterprise customers was botched so badly. We tried to warn leadership that selling to enterprise customers is more elaborate than just \"hands on keyboards\" but any questions about the approach were dismissed during all-hands. There is a certain level of rose colored glasses in everything that happens at Sprout. We had layoffs but you'd would think that Sprout had their best year ever from the comments made during all-hands meetings. \n- Calibrations and promotions in R&amp;D are not objective. Get on the bad side of a principle engineer and they will tank your career at Sprout. If your manager doesn't fight for you, you won't get a promotion and won't get calibrated properly which affects your salary since Sprout doesn't do cost of living adjustments and very rarely does market adjustments. \n- \"Staff Software Engineer\" is a terminal career band at Sprout. Nobody gets promoted from Staff to anything above it unless you've been an engineering manager or director previously and you are stepping away from a manager role back to an IC role. This wouldn't be so bad but the salary band is narrow, not allowing for growth in the band still assuming that you'd grow out of that band to be able to get a raise. \n- Speaking of raises, we thought compensation was going to improve with annual equity refreshes taking the place of cost of living adjustments but they've already started to walk back the annual equity grants. I would not be surprised after our 2024 performance that there aren't any annual equity grants in 2025, they already tried to tamp down expectations in 2024.\n- We're constantly asked to do more with less. We're not back filling attrition unless we can \"back fill\" that position with an ASE. We're having to beg to get budget to be able to just have proper logging in our services to be able to debug properly. We'd rather have a senior engineer spend weeks trying to squeeze out performance from a service than just spend the few hundred dollars extra a month for horizontal scaling.",

Not only that, promotions and raises do not come easily even if you consistently exceed goals and metrics. It also felt like feedback fell on deaf ears, and whenever feedback was submitted, it didn't matter at all. My biggest feedback is that Support feels like the red-headed stepchild of the company. There's always this pressure to meet metrics and when you mention you feel burnt out, they tell you to have a \"growth mindset\". Whenever there are company events or R&amp;R days, you can't actually take advantage of that because someone has to be scheduled to work to meet these impossible goals/metrics. You're expected to be a team player and say yes to increasing tasks or schedule changes, even if your workload is heavy. This adds onto more pressure and if you try to set boundaries (like they encourage), you're given negative feedback. After some turnover of more tenured employees (which is telling), it felt like nothing was done to boost team morale and we were still held to an impossibly high standard. All in all, Sprout is probably a great company to work for but the Support team is not.",

People are extremely entitled and more and more enabled to behave like corporate bullies. Even people I once considered friends are showing me sides of themselves that shock me. This probably is due to the fact that our leadership team feels very absent, so to make up for it, people really are trying to prove their place and pave the way for their own success, or they're so stressed they're taking it out on others. It's become a \"what's in it for me\" culture. The things that drew me to the company years ago are gone. I understand change is inevitable and I support change in general, but these issues are cracks in our very DNA, not just a byproduct of being a larger and more international team moving at quick speeds. There's no accountability and now it feels often like we're running in circles.\n\nPay is also extremely low. When I talk to peers outside Sprout, but in the exact same role, they're all getting at least 30% higher base pay, have better benefits, and earn cash bonuses. Leadership has been challenged on staying competitive with compensation again and again, and look the other way. RSUs that vest in a few years are not enough in this economy, especially when stock prices aren't guaranteed and are influenced by outside factors we have no control over. My bills continue to increase but I won't ever get a penny more in salary until I'm promoted, and even then it'll be a small bump. Overall, the company feels really cheap and like it's a pain to spend any money for needs the team has.",

Often, these decision-makers are detached from your day-to-day reality. Consequently, your manager's feedback and peer evaluations hold little sway. The final decisions are conveyed with vague and subjective feedback, often at odds with the content of previous one-on-one discussions throughout the year.\n\n- pay directly linked to career progress -\nIf your career stalls, so does your salary. Coupled with prevalent favoritism, this dynamic means your earnings may not keep pace with inflation unless you cater to the whims of the influential few.\n\n- fragile egos -\nMany individuals in crucial decision-making roles have tenure rather than merit as the basis of their positions. Among them, there exists a prevalence of delicate egos, potentially stemming from imposter syndrome. Correcting or disagreeing with them—even failing to express sufficient enthusiasm for their ideas—can easily cause offense. In such instances, it's often best to seek opportunities elsewhere, as your career prospects within the organization may become limited.\n\nThese dynamics cast Sprouts' values in a dubious light, revealing them as mere illusions. When the facade of objectivity fades, morale inevitably declines. Consequently, employees tend to disengage, merely going through the motions, or they decide to leave the organization altogether.",

Sprout has traditionally been unique because of the incredible inbound funnel for sales teams. Inbound has dried up and all teams are expected to outbound, which is normal across the market. However, there's lots of ambiguity, a lack of team and individual coaching, extreme pressure to hit metrics, and monthly quotas, and 1 bad quarter will put you on a performance plan, with no remorse or consideration of previous success. Unfortunately, managers are not experienced in cold calling, and sales teams' morale is extremely low. Sprout sales teams' compensation is relatively low and since most are not hitting quota anymore, the base compensation is not as competitive either.",

You may get a stock grant, but it's just a millstone to keep working for a company that doesn't care about you. \n\nAfter a change in Marketing leadership, a decline in employee engagement, and general attrition throughout the year, there were promises made that things would get better. That management would take employee feedback seriously and implement change. \n\nThe single change was an update to the career bands structure, which is actually worse than it was before. There's no longer a competency for bringing 'business value'. The emphasis is much more on communication and collaboration, which is incredibly challenging at a company with so much organizational debt that getting anything done requires moving mountains. With these new bands, any actual work that moved the company forward and drove revenue will slow as everyone ensures they don't step on anyone's toes and risk that promotion.\n\nThe only time where you can get any change in role and significant increase in salary is during the annual review (which is held each April, a solid 4 months after the year has ended). If you just come short, or if you get feedback you weren't expecting, prepare to wait 12 more months for any meaningful salary change.\n\nIt seems like they're doing as much as they can to not promote employees or give them additional compensation.

I appreciate the investment you’ve made in Sprout over the years, and I wanted you to know that I read your review and I hear you.\n\nWe value recognizing great work at Sprout. For that reason, all team members are evaluated at least once a year for merit increases, which are based on performance, market rate and time since last increase, as well as promotions, which are based on a combination of performance and business need. Quarterly Check-ins, which we just completed in July, are also dedicated time to discuss your performance and career development goals with your manager. \n\nThe refreshed Marketing career bands are designed to provide more clear and specific guidance based on industry and Sprout standards. Business impact is incorporated throughout the competencies, on which all team members were invited to provide feedback before they were finalized. Bands are just one part of career development, and we’re proud to have rolled out several new programs including Grow@Sprout professional development awards for conferences and courses, Marketing department-wide study groups on topics team members are most interested in, self-paced learning through our ANA sponsorship, and more.\n\nI encourage you to work with your manager on how the updated career bands apply to your role and the important business impact you make at Sprout. If those conversations aren’t feeling productive, please reach out to your People Business Partner—we’re invested in the growth of all Sprout employees and want to ensure you’re receiving regular feedback and coaching across the annual review, quarterly check-ins, and regular 1:1s.\n\nThanks again for taking the time to share your thoughts. I hope you’ll share this feedback with your manager or People Business Partner, so we have the chance to improve your experience at Sprout. I really do want you to see Sprout as a place where you can continue to grow your career.",

Not only that, promotions and raises do not come easily even if you consistently exceed goals and metrics. It also felt like feedback fell on deaf ears, and whenever feedback was submitted, it didn't matter at all. My biggest feedback is that Support feels like the red-headed stepchild of the company. There's always this pressure to meet metrics and when you mention you feel burnt out, they tell you to have a \"growth mindset\". Whenever there are company events or R&amp;R days, you can't actually take advantage of that because someone has to be scheduled to work to meet these impossible goals/metrics. You're expected to be a team player and say yes to increasing tasks or schedule changes, even if your workload is heavy. This adds onto more pressure and if you try to set boundaries (like they encourage), you're given negative feedback. After some turnover of more tenured employees (which is telling), it felt like nothing was done to boost team morale and we were still held to an impossibly high standard. All in all, Sprout is probably a great company to work for but the Support team is not.",

However, there's lots of ambiguity, a lack of team and individual coaching, extreme pressure to hit metrics, and monthly quotas, and 1 bad quarter will put you on a performance plan, with no remorse or consideration of previous success. Unfortunately, managers are not experienced in cold calling, and sales teams' morale is extremely low.

        "cons": "Sprout no longer feels like we're all in this together or we're one team working toward one goal. People are extremely entitled and more and more enabled to behave like corporate bullies. Even people I once considered friends are showing me sides of themselves that shock me. This probably is due to the fact that our leadership team feels very absent, so to make up for it, people really are trying to prove their place and pave the way for their own success, or they're so stressed they're taking it out on others. It's become a \"what's in it for me\" culture. The things that drew me to the company years ago are gone. I understand change is inevitable and I support change in general, but these issues are cracks in our very DNA, not just a byproduct of being a larger and more international team moving at quick speeds. There's no accountability and now it feels often like we're running in circles.\n\nPay is also extremely low. When I talk to peers outside Sprout, but in the exact same role, they're all getting at least 30% higher base pay, have better benefits, and earn cash bonuses. Leadership has been challenged on staying competitive with compensation again and again, and look the other way. RSUs that vest in a few years are not enough in this economy, especially when stock prices aren't guaranteed and are influenced by outside factors we have no control over. My bills continue to increase but I won't ever get a penny more in salary until I'm promoted, and even then it'll be a small bump. Overall, the company feels really cheap and like it's a pain to spend any money for needs the team has.",

Ultimately, it mirrors the typical experience at any other company I've worked for. Advancement hinges on the favor of a select few individuals whose opinions carry weight; regardless of your achievements, if they harbor reservations or prefer someone else, progress stalls. Often, these decision-makers are detached from your day-to-day reality. Consequently, your manager's feedback and peer evaluations hold little sway. The final decisions are conveyed with vague and subjective feedback, often at odds with the content of previous one-on-one discussions throughout the year.\n\n- pay directly linked to career progress -\nIf your career stalls, so does your salary. Coupled with prevalent favoritism, this dynamic means your earnings may not keep pace with inflation unless you cater to the whims of the influential few.\n\n- fragile egos -\nMany individuals in crucial decision-making roles have tenure rather than merit as the basis of their positions. Among them, there exists a prevalence of delicate egos, potentially stemming from imposter syndrome. Correcting or disagreeing with them—even failing to express sufficient enthusiasm for their ideas—can easily cause offense. In such instances, it's often best to seek opportunities elsewhere, as your career prospects within the organization may become limited.\n\nThese dynamics cast Sprouts' values in a dubious light, revealing them as mere illusions.

        "cons": "There's no recognition for doing your job well or going above and beyond unless you overtly promote yourself internally, which has lead to a culture of toxic positivity. \n\nIt's incredibly challenging to get promoted, which is the only time your compensation will increase (no bonus structure, no yearly adjustments, etc...). You may get a stock grant, but it's just a millstone to keep working for a company that doesn't care about you. \n\nAfter a change in Marketing leadership, a decline in employee engagement, and general attrition throughout the year, there were promises made that things would get better. That management would take employee feedback seriously and implement change. \n\nThe single change was an update to the career bands structure, which is actually worse than it was before. There's no longer a competency for bringing 'business value'. The emphasis is much more on communication and collaboration, which is incredibly challenging at a company with so much organizational debt that getting anything done requires moving mountains. With these new bands, any actual work that moved the company forward and drove revenue will slow as everyone ensures they don't step on anyone's toes and risk that promotion.\n\nThe only time where you can get any change in role and significant increase in salary is during the annual review (which is held each April, a solid 4 months after the year has ended). If you just come short, or if you get feedback you weren't expecting, prepare to wait 12 more months for any meaningful salary change.\n\nIt seems like they're doing as much as they can to not promote employees or give them additional compensation. Strange, coming from a company whose Core Values include \"Caring Deeply\".",

The current CEO is in over his head, constantly has to course correct because he forgets that he's not just talking to sales people (\"win every deal\" morphing into \"win every customer\") to be honest, just gives off too much sales bro vibes compared to our previous CEO who I think was much more down to earth. \n\nStop hiring new senior leadership bringing ideas that only work for companies 10x our size with 10x the number of people in R&amp;D. We're just too small to introduce these really elaborate ways of working like stacked ranked priorities, workstreams, phase gates, etc. This is going to create a more political environment and encourage turf building in those who have been hired from companies like Amazon where that is encouraged. \n\nThere is no way you are going to be able to hire all of these new VPs of product management in any reasonable amount of time to fill all of these new positions you created after decimating the existing product management org. Bring back the senior PMs and let them grow into the roles you need. \n\nThe cynical side of me says the difficulty filling these positions and the promised new platform engineer positions is a feature, not a bug to not spend any more money but make it look like we're doing okay as a company with all of these open positions. This is the classic definition of \"ghost job\".",
        "cons": "- Sprout values and culture are more of a vibe than \"this is how we work\". This is an effort ongoing to relaunch the values next year but I am suspicious that this is going to be a \"rules for thee, not for me\" especially after how the 10% R&amp;D layoffs were handled (laying people off by email is pretty low). \n- Most leadership have not had much experience outside of Sprout, let alone a company as large as Sprout so there is a lot of on the job training going on which explains how the transition to focusing on enterprise customers was botched so badly. We tried to warn leadership that selling to enterprise customers is more elaborate than just \"hands on keyboards\" but any questions about the approach were dismissed during all-hands. There is a certain level of rose colored glasses in everything that happens at Sprout. We had layoffs but you'd would think that Sprout had their best year ever from the comments made during all-hands meetings. \n- Calibrations and promotions in R&amp;D are not objective. Get on the bad side of a principle engineer and they will tank your career at Sprout. If your manager doesn't fight for you, you won't get a promotion and won't get calibrated properly which affects your salary since Sprout doesn't do cost of living adjustments and very rarely does market adjustments. \n- \"Staff Software Engineer\" is a terminal career band at Sprout. Nobody gets promoted from Staff to anything above it unless you've been an engineering manager or director previously and you are stepping away from a manager role back to an IC role. This wouldn't be so bad but the salary band is narrow, not allowing for growth in the band still assuming that you'd grow out of that band to be able to get a raise. \n- Speaking of raises, we thought compensation was going to improve with annual equity refreshes taking the place of cost of living adjustments but they've already started to walk back the annual equity grants.

To get a better idea of how glued users are, let's look at some social media usage statistics.\n\nBelow is a quick snapshot of how social media demographics and usage are changing, which networks are winning and how hooked consumers are on social.\n\nIn 2024, there are estimated to be 5.17 billion total social media users worldwide.\n\nThe average person uses 6.7 different social networks per month.\n\nThe amount of time internet users spend on social media declined slightly to 143 minutes per day.\n\nTikTok is the fastest-growing platform with a staggering 100% user growth rate between 2020 and 2022. And between Q3 2022 and Q3 2023, TikTok's monthly active users grew 13%.\n\nThe number of social media users worldwide grew by 320 million people from January 2023 to January 2024.\n\nGrowth may seem slow, but that's due to the sheer number of people who already use social media. This means social media presents a huge opportunity for marketers and advertisers.\n\nHowever, with users spread across several platforms, it’s more important than ever for brands to take a multi-channel approach. Don't forget to leverage emerging platforms like TikTok to reach new audiences and stand out from the competition.\n\nSocial media advertising statistics\n\nAs organic reach decreases on nearly every platform, paid social media advertising becomes a must-use strategy for reaching your target audience. Learn more about social advertising stats to inform your strategy.\n\nTotal spend on social media advertising is projected to reach $219.8 billion in 2024.\n\nIt's now projected that $255.8 billion of total social media ad spending will be generated through mobile by 2028.\n\nTotal ad spend growth is anticipated at 6.1% in 2024.\n\nSocial media ads account for 28.8% of all digital advertising spend.\n\nBusinesses put around 8.7% of their total revenue towards their ads budget.\n\nSocial media ad spend is growing at a steady rate.

Whether or not brands should focus on Facebook is a tough question that really depends on your individual Facebook metrics. The following Facebook statistics can clue you in further.\n\nFacebook is the most-used platform by marketers worldwide (89%). Instagram sits in second place (80%).\n\nAs of Q3 2023, Facebook is the largest online social network in the world with roughly 3.05 billion monthly active users.\n\nThe average American spends about 31 minutes per day on Facebook.\n\n56.3% of Facebook users are male and 43.7% are female (based on available gender data).\n\nAlmost a quarter of Facebook users in the US are between the ages 25-34.\n\nFacebook remains a favorite among marketers. That’s not surprising, considering the massive reach offered by the platform. Plus, the increasing average age means more users are in high-level, decision-making positions in their careers.\n\nInstagram statistics\n\nInstagram boasts 2 billion actively monthly users and yet brands are still scrambling to get more Instagram followers.

Hint: now’s the time to level up your LinkedIn marketing if you’re in B2B.\n\nPinterest statistics\n\nPinterest often doesn’t get its due when it comes to social platforms. The platform’s diverse, big-spending audience is among the most dedicated and engaged of any network.

The platform’s rabid fanbase, rapid growth and sky-high usage spell great news for early adopters.

With more people accessing the app on mobile, marketers would benefit from posting more short-form, vertical content (i.e. Shorts) on the platform.\n\nSocial media video statistics\n\nVideo continues to be an all-time favorite content type.

Let’s look at some recent social media video statistics.\n\n44% of people prefer to learn about a new product or service via short video content.\n\n87% of marketers say video marketing has directly increased sales.\n\nShort-form video offers marketers the highest ROI of any social media marketing strategy, with 30-60 videos seeing the most success.\n\nUS video advertising is expected to increase from $76.97 billion in 2023 to $84.61 billion in 2024.\n\nVideo is making its way into all types of marketing strategies in virtually every industry.

If influencers are not already part of your marketing efforts, it’s time to switch your focus. The key is to pick the best platforms and influencers for your brand, both of which can be automated using the right tools.\n\nConsumer behavior statistics\n\nThe concept of buying something you saw on social media is nothing new.

Understanding statistics around its usage, demographics, marketing uses and more can help inform your marketing strategy.\n\nSo without further ado, let’s dig in.\n\nTop 3 Facebook stats every marketer should know\n\nFacebook usage statistics\n\nFacebook user statistics\n\nFacebook audience and demographics statistics\n\nFacebook advertising and marketing statistics\n\nFacebook engagement statistics\n\nFacebook video statistics\n\nFacebook feature stats (Reels, Stories, Messenger)\n\nFacebook consumer behavior statistics\n\nTop 3 Facebook stats every marketer should know\n\nFacebook is the third most visited website following Google and YouTube, respectively. This puts it ahead of other leading platforms like Twitter and Instagram.\n\nThe platform boasts 3.065 billion active users on a monthly basis. This makes it the most used social media platform worldwide.\n\nIn 2023, Facebook’s total ad revenue amounted to $135 billion, up from $116 billion the previous year.\n\nFacebook usage statistics\n\nOver the years, Facebook has become almost synonymous with social media. It continues to be the biggest social media platform and is widely popular on a global scale. Here are some of the key Facebook usage statistics to understand its popularity and inform your Facebook marketing strategy:\n\n1. Facebook hit 3 billion monthly active users in 2023\n\nBy Q4 of 2023, monthly active users on the platform had grown to 3.065 billion after reaching the 3 billion user milestone in Q2 of 2023. Although adoption has slowed down, monthly usage is still seeing an upward trend. If your marketing efforts are also feeling stagnant, download our Facebook marketing template to reinvigorate your strategy.\n\n2. Americans spend about 30.9 minutes on the platform daily\n\nOn average, American users spend about 30.9 minutes on Facebook daily. This puts it ahead of other leading platforms such as X, Instagram and even TikTok. These numbers suggest that the platform is still seeing a high level of engagement from its user base.\n\nFacebook user statistics\n\nFacebook may have billions of users, but how are these people using the platform? Let’s look at a few vital Facebook user statistics to find out:\n\n3. Over two-third of all monthly users are active daily\n\nOut of the 3.065 billion monthly active users, 2.1 billion people use the platform daily. That’s 68.6% of users who spend at least some amount of time daily on the platform.\n\nIn other words, there are billions of people your brand could potentially reach every single day. The key is to get ahead of the Facebook algorithm so you can get more organic visibility.\n\n4. Facebook is the most popular site for people to get their news\n\nOut of U.S. adults who regularly look to social media for their news, 30% of them head to Facebook. This is ahead of YouTube (26%), Instagram (16%), TikTok (14%) and X (12%).\n\n5. Messaging friends and family is still the top activity on Facebook\n\nOver 72% of users say they use Facebook to message friends and family. This suggests that the platform’s “social” factor is still alive and kicking. Other popular activities on the platform are posting/sharing photos and videos (63.5%) and keeping up to date with news and events (58.7%).\n\nA significant number of users (54.3%) follow and research brands and products on Facebook. So although it’s mostly for social, your brand can still use the platform to build authentic connections.\n\n6. 59% of Facebook users have reached out to a brand on the platform\n\nSocial media is also commonly used for customer support requests. One survey found that 59% of Facebook users have reached out to a brand on the platform. Forty-six percent of those messages have been specifically in regards to customer care issues.\n\nEven though Facebook is a social network, it can still be a great outlet for providing customer support and improving experiences with your brand. In fact, 76% of consumers notice and appreciate when companies prioritize customer support, regardless of network.\n\nFacebook audience and demographics statistics\n\nWondering if you’re reaching the right audience on Facebook? What if your target demographic isn’t even on the platform? Here are a few Facebook stats highlighting the platform’s audience and demographics:\n\n7. Users ages 25-34 years represent Facebook’s largest audience\n\nDespite the platform’s reputation as a seemingly “older” network, 24.4% of Facebook users in the United States are between the ages of 25 and 34. Moreover, the platform sees higher usage among people below the age of 44.\n\n8. Usage among teens has dropped sharply\n\nThat said, the platform’s popularity among teens has seen a significant drop. Only 33% of teens were using Facebook as of 2023. This is a sharp decline compared to the 71% who were using the platform between 2014 and 2015.\n\n9. Facebook has more male-identifying users than female\n\nFacebook currently limits its reporting to male and female. And based on the data, the platform has a higher percentage of male users (56.3%) than female users (43.7%).\n\n10. India has the largest Facebook audience size\n\nWhile Facebook sees significant usage across various countries, India has the greatest number of users. Latest reports show that there are 314.6 million Facebook users in India. The United States comes next, with 175 million users.\n\nFacebook advertising and marketing statistics\n\nIs Facebook marketing still worth it? And are you getting the most out of your Facebook advertising strategy? Check out these Facebook ads statistics to understand advertising impact on the platform.\n\n11. Facebook ads see an average click-through rate (CTR) of 2.50%\n\nAccording to a WordStream study, Facebook ads get an average CTR of 2.50% across all industries for lead gen ads. That said, click-throughs vary for industries, with arts & entertainment, physicians & surgeons, real estate and sports & recreation sectors seeing a CTR of at least 3% and the travel industry hitting a CTR of over 6%.\n\nFacebook traffic ads and campaigns see a lower CTR, with the average rate being 1.51% across all industries. Arts & entertainment, real estate, restaurants & food and travel all see a CTR above 2%.\n\n12. Advertising for traffic campaigns on Facebook costs $0.83 per click\n\nThe same study found that the average cost per click (CPC) is $0.83 across all industries for traffic ads and $1.92 for lead gen ads. However, you can expect to pay much more in certain industries or campaign ads. For example, lead gen ads have a CPC of over $5 for attorneys and nearly $4 for dentists and physicians.\n\n13. The average conversion rate is 8.25% across industries\n\nFacebook sees a fairly high conversion rate for ads on the platform. On average, you can expect a conversion rate of about 8.25% for your Facebook ad. However, the specifics may vary depending on your industry. Arts & entertainment, dental services, industrial & commercial and real estate sectors see a significantly higher conversion rate.\n\n14. Facebook generates the highest ROI\n\nNeedless to say, with such high conversion rates and low CPC, marketing on Facebook yields high returns. In fact, Facebook generates the highest return on investment among all other social media platforms, tied only with Instagram at 29%.\n\nFacebook engagement statistics\n\nWith organic visibility on Facebook on the decline, it’s only natural to see a drop in engagement levels as well. But does this put Facebook at a disadvantage over other social media platforms? Here’s a quick look at some vital stats to understand where Facebook engagement:\n\n15. The median engagement rate on Facebook is 0.063%\n\nAccording to a RivalIQ study, brands see a median Facebook engagement rate of 0.063% across all industries. This puts Facebook as one of the less engaging social media platforms, beating only X/Twitter’s 0.029% engagement rate.\n\n16. Photo posts and status posts have the highest engagement\n\nThe power of visuals is still evident on Facebook, with photo posts getting the highest engagement at 0.10%. Video posts come next with an average engagement rate of 0.08%. Status posts perform fairly well with an average engagement rate of 0.06%. Link posts, on the other hand, are the worst for driving engagement. They see an average engagement rate of only 0.03%.\n\n17. Frequent posting doesn’t result in higher engagement\n\nContrary to popular belief, posting frequently doesn’t necessarily result in higher engagement. As the RivalIQ study points out, influencers and higher education industry see the greatest engagement compared to their posting frequency.\n\nInfluencers and higher education pages publish fewer than 10 posts per week. Meanwhile, media companies publish over 60 posts a week and only see an average engagement rate of 0.04%.\n\nRather than post frequency, post publishing should be a factor in your strategy. Know the best time to post on Facebook so you stand a better chance of driving engagement.\n\nFacebook video statistics\n\nAs video marketing continues to gain popularity, it’s important to be aware of how video performs on Facebook. Here are some key Facebook video statistics to inform your strategy:\n\n18. 50% of the time users spend on Facebook is spent watching videos\n\nAccording to Facebook’s own data, about half the time spent on Facebook (and Instagram) is watching video content. This means your audience likely watches video content on the app, and creating more video can help you reach more people. We’re created a quick guide on creating a successful social media video strategy, if you need a refresher.\n\n19. Vertical video with audio sees a 35% higher click-through rate\n\nFacebook Reels have been popular on the app since they were created and integrated into the app from Instagram. Facebook discovered that vertical video (Reels) with audio see a 35% higher CTR than other types of video content on the platform.\n\nFacebook feature stats (Reels, Stories, Messenger)\n\nSo, what sort of content should you post? What features are growing and what’s stagnant? Let’s review some Facebook stats that break down some of the platform’s key features, like Facebook Stories, Reels and Messenger:\n\n20. More than 500 million people use Stories every day\n\nAccording to internal Facebook data, half a billion people use Facebook Stories each day and more than 1 billion Stories shared every day across the Meta apps. This speaks to the popularity of the platform’s feature, making it a useful tool for brands to engage their audience.\n\n21. Facebook Messenger has nearly 1 billion users\n\nMeanwhile, there are nearly 1 billion people using Facebook Messenger. That’s almost a billion people you could potentially reach through ads on Messenger.\n\n22. Reels hit 200 billion views per day across Facebook apps\n\nThe popularity of Reels isn’t dying out anytime soon. In fact, Reels see about 200 billion views on a daily basis across the Facebook family of apps.\n\nWith algorithms further pushing this format, Reels could help you gain visibility and engagement. In short, brands can’t afford to put this short-form video format on the back burner.\n\nFacebook consumer behavior statistics\n\nFinally, are people even shopping on Facebook? Here are some stats on how consumers are behaving on the platform:\n\n23. Facebook has the highest number of social commerce buyers\n\nAccording to eMarketer, US adults were more likely to make a purchase directly on Facebook in Q1 2023. However, when compared to Gen Z buyers, it’s in fourth place behind TikTok, Instagram and YouTube.\n\n24. Facebook commerce is expected to hit 64.6 million shoppers in 2024\n\nAs the most popular social media platform for commerce, there are tens of millions of shoppers on the platform.

As such, you can use these to guide your strategy and understand what to prioritize. To advance your strategy even further, take advantage of different Facebook marketing tools.\n\nFacebook statistics FAQs\n\nHow do I find my Facebook stats?\n\nYou can find your Facebook Page’s unique Facebook stats by logging into your business page and heading to your Facebook Insights.\n\nWhat are statistics for Facebook Reels?\n\nFacebook Reels have been popular on the app since integrated from Instagram. Facebook Reels with audio see a 35% higher CTR than other types of video content on the platform. And across Facebook and Instagram, Reels see about 200 billion views daily.\n\nIs Facebook still growing?\n\nFacebook adoption is seeing slow growth and still hit 3 billion monthly active users by the end of Q4 2023.

But think about how you can bring long-form storytelling into your content.\n\nTrend 2: Playful content is the new “brand personality”\n\nThe “edgy” brand voice is taking a back seat to a new brand trend: experimenting with playful content.\n\nBrands have consistently found creative ways to tap into meme culture and the voice of the Internet in a way that fits their voice. And we’ve seen more brands experimenting with their voice and visual content to do so.\n\nTake LinkedIn’s Threads, which have a human voice and cover topics that range from relatable and hilarious, to inspirational and endearing.\n\nAnd we love the way Auntie Anne’s pretzels has create a strategic, branded social media meme strategy. They create content that riffs on Internet culture, memes and trends while still staying true to their brand colors, tone and image.\n\nBrand takeaway: Think about how your brand can get playful on social media. You don’t have to do this in a way that breaks your brand’s voice and tone. What trends and meme formats could you adapt to fit your brand’s content?\n\nTrend 3: The expansion of social commerce remains a trend to watch—and use\n\nWe’ve all seen the #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt trend…or bought something after seeing it on TikTok or another social platform ourselves.\n\nBut this is more than a fleeting trend—social commerce is a continuing trend to watch and consider for your strategy. And platforms like TikTok are pushing for it. TikTok Shop officially launched in the US in late 2023. And they’re already testing ways to make that in-app shopping even easier.\n\nWe talked to Social Strategy Director at Mekanism, Jeff MacDonald, about current social trends to watch. And this is one that he flagged. As he puts it, live streaming and interactive shopping experiences are only expected to expand, so this trend is likely here to stay. “Live shopping events, combining entertainment with instant purchasing options, offer an engaging way for brands to connect with consumers. This year will be a test to see if North American audiences will adopt live commerce streams like other audiences have.”\n\nBrand takeaway: If you haven’t experimented with selling on social, now is a great time to test this out. There’s an eager, ready-to-buy audience on social. Give them another way to buy—look into whether opening up shop on TikTok, Facebook or Instagram is right for your brand.\n\nTrend 4: SEO is important for social channels too—not just your site\n\nRecently, I did research on a few places I want to travel and hike this coming summer. I didn’t turn to Google—I searched location hashtags on Instagram.\n\nDon’t underestimate the power of social media platforms as search engines. In 2022, nearly 40% of Gen Z preferred TikTok over Google for searching for information.\n\nThis makes optimizing your content for discoverability—both in feed and via search—more important than ever before.\n\nBrand takeaway: Just as you would optimize an article on your blog or a page on your site for SEO, take an optimized approach to your social content. Optimize your posts and profile for maximum discoverability by using the right keywords in your caption, the right hashtags and relevant keywords within your alt text, too.\n\nTrend 5: Behind-the-scenes content and reimagined transparency\n\nThe rising audience desire for authentic content lends itself to the need for brands to be more transparent about their business practices on social.\n\nBut there’s been an interesting shift. A few years ago, we couldn’t talk about trends in social media without covering the importance of brands speaking up—or getting called out. But in 2023, only a quarter of consumers polled in the Index said the most memorable brands on social spoke out about causes and news aligned with their values.\n\nThe Index also found the second biggest thing consumers don’t see enough of from brands on social media is transparency about business practices and values.\n\nI take this to mean that while brands speaking out used to set them apart, now it’s a regular expectation that brands demonstrate transparency and their values as a regular practice. We talked to Paula Perez, Social Engagement & Community Growth Specialist at Oatly, about current social trends. And as Perez puts it, “Consumers are more interested than ever in labor practices, diversity, investor relations, supply chain, company leadership, and environmental responsibility.”\n\nFor example, shoe brand Nisolo regularly creates and posts sustainability “report cards” for their products.\n\nBrand takeaway: Look for opportunities to provide more transparency about your business, products and practices. You can start as simple as creating behind-the-scenes content of your office, products being made, the people behind your products and your sustainability values. Make sure you have action or proof to back up your statements.\n\nAnd if questions do arise that your brand should address, use the right tools to stay proactive. Social listening will help you identify rising conversation topics early, enabling you to understand and get ahead of an issue, and identify the changes you need to make.\n\nTrend 6: Authentic content resonates across platforms\n\nAuthentic, non-promotional content is the number one thing consumers say they don’t see enough of from brands on social, according to The Sprout Social Index™. We’ve seen the way creator culture has skyrocketed in popularity—and brands featuring authentic voices, from creators to employees, shine against those that don’t.\n\nAnd it’s crucial for brands to recognize that this trend is here to stay—it’s the new era of social media.\n\nWe talked to Flywire Social Media Manager Sam Mackowitz, who believes AI is only driving this desire for more authenticity. “I think people will be yearning for authentic experiences on social media. Don’t get me wrong, AI is fantastic and can help us get places faster, but…that personal aspect is so important and will continue to be in 2024.”\n\nBrand takeaway: Besides tapping into creators, create more authentic owned content, too. As Mackowitz explains, “At Flywire, the content that performs the best for us is always when it’s showcasing our employees. We’ve had great success showcasing the people behind the payments! Authenticity will soar in 2024.”\n\nThink: playful posts and featuring fellow employees in video content who aren’t camera shy, or a “meet the team” series. Get creative!\n\nAn employee advocacy strategy is a stellar way to promote your brand authentically. Using a platform like Employee Advocacy by Sprout Social makes it easier for your employees to discover content and copy suggestions you curate for them to share.\n\nTrend 7: The evolution of social teams and titles\n\nIs your social team structure based on networks? Then you’re not alone—according to the Index, 64% of social teams are aligned to specific social platforms or networks.\n\nBut the reality is, your team structure is constantly running the risk of becoming outdated. As social media evolves, so do the teams and the skills needed to run it successfully. And the emergence of new platforms, like Threads, always brings back the same question: whose responsibility is a new platform when you’re divided by network?\n\nNew social media jobs and titles are emerging and evolving rapidly. We talked to Gabby Grahek, Strategic Services Consultant at Sprout and a social media thought leader, about current social trends. “I’m hoping and praying for social specialties on social teams. With organizations continuing to experiment with social, build a budget for these teams and elevate their maturity levels when you can.”\n\nBrand takeaway: Gabby thinks “we’ll see niche social professions develop on corporate teams.” Evaluate your current team structure and identify gaps. This is a great opportunity to take additional ownership over your career path and pitch a new role that fits your skillset. Or, make the case to your manager that you need more headcount to accommodate a new role.\n\nTrend 8: The boom of the creator and influencer economy\n\nToday, it’s the creator and influencer’s world—we’re just posting in it.\n\nIn the era of authenticity, creators and influencers lend an authentic, human voice and experience to the social scroll. And their place on brand accounts is only going to become more important to connecting with audiences. In fact, in a Q3 Sprout Pulse Survey of 307 US-based marketers, 8 in 10 social marketers describe influencer marketing as essential to their social strategies.\n\nAs Jeff MacDonald mentioned, “The continued dominance of TikTok underscores the shift towards more authentic, unfiltered content. This trend is likely to grow, with users gravitating towards content that feels genuine and relatable. Brands will increasingly leverage creators and influencers who can craft compelling stories and connect with audiences on a personal level.”\n\nBrand takeaway: The rise of creators and influencers and the authentic voice they provide will likely remain on the list of social media trends for years to come. So now is the time to kick off your creator and influencer marketing partnerships and program, if you haven’t already.\n\nAs Jeff put it, “Authenticity in content not only enhances engagement but also fosters trust and loyalty among consumers. This trend is very much in line with the human-centric approach to social media, where human creativity and connection are pivotal in crafting brand messages.”\n\nConsider adopting a dedicated creator and influencer management platform, which over half of brands have done according to a Q3 Sprout Pulse Survey. Platforms like Sprout Social Influencer Marketing (formerly Tagger) make managing your influencer partnerships and their impact easier.\n\nTrend 9: Personalized customer care is a consumer preference\n\nThe expectations for social media customer service have only gone up. Consumers no longer just want fast responses—70% of them expect personalized responses to their customer service needs, according to the Index.\n\nAnd 76% of consumers notice and appreciate when companies prioritize customer support—so companies who don’t do so inevitably fall behind.\n\nBrand takeaway: Stay up to date with customer service trends. Analyze your role in social customer care: how responsive are you being, and what can you do to scale your efforts?\n\nSome 75% of businesses in the Index say that social customer care will be shared to some degree by marketing and customer service teams. If this is also the case for you, remember that solid customer care is about empowering all teams involved to collaborate and communicate. Ensure that both teams are aligned on social voice and tone, response best practices, canned response use, chat bot updates and more.\n\nFeatures like Sprout’s Case Management enable teams to seamlessly work together to resolve customer issues, while integrations with platforms like Zendesk and Salesforce enable agents and social team members alike to get more context behind customer interactions, making personalization much easier.\n\nTrend 10: Marketing and customer care teams use AI regularly…and monitor it closely\n\nThe use of AI to streamline workflows remains one of the current social media trends that will stretch into this year—and beyond.\n\nAccording to The 2023 Social Index™, over 80% of marketers have already seen the positive impact of AI on their work. You yourself may be in that group. And beyond scaling content creation and customer care responses, AI will likely play an even larger role as a marketing and customer care tool.\n\nAs Jeff MacDonald tells us, “In 2024, we can expect a deeper integration of AI in personalizing user experiences. AI can analyze user data to provide highly tailored content recommendations, enhance customer service with more responsive chatbots, and drive more effective targeted advertising. This trend aligns with the increasing efficiency in content production, as AI tools become more adept at understanding and replicating human-like interactions and creativity.”\n\nBut this year, we forecast that this trend will look a little different. While there’s been a sustained use in AI, we’ve also seen a trend of increased conversations around AI ethics and using it safely.\n\nAs Gabby Grahek puts it, “Now that the shock of AI availability is wearing off, I expect companies that have been hesitant to adopt AI tools will develop (strict) adherence and governance policies to start taking advantage of the efficiencies available from the use of AI.”\n\nBrand takeaway: Join the marketers who are using AI to scale their content creation and customer care efforts. But always use it carefully and ethically—create an AI use policy to safeguard your brand and team.\n\nTrend 11: Social data is key—beyond the marketing team\n\nOne of the biggest social media myths is that social data is only relevant to social or marketing. On the contrary—social media data has the power to inform every area and team of your organization and improve your entire business, from product, to customer support to PR.\n\nAccording to the Index, 76% of marketers agree that their team’s social insights inform other departments. And this trend is here to stay. Companies that don’t use social to inform their wider business will undoubtedly fall behind.\n\nNot to mention, getting deep into the data is one of the best ways to identify trends in social media in your owned content.\n\nAs social teams become more sophisticated, so will their use of data beyond their team…as long as social teams know how to communicate that data with other departments.\n\nBrand takeaway: You already know how valuable social data is—this year, demonstrate this to other teams. Download our 2024 Social Media Toolkit for six resources that will help you streamline your strategy and share its impact.\n\nUse these social media trends to keep your strategy one step ahead\n\nWe can’t always know when a new platform, content format or trending TikTok sound will bubble up. In fact, they usually surprise us in a drop-everything-and-film-this-content way.\n\nBut we can look at the larger social media marketing trends now and use them to build a stronger strategy that sets us up for success. And that creates a solid foundation that not even the advent of a new platform can shake. (Well, maybe a little.)",

Many of these updates will be featured in Breaking Ground, Sprout’s quarterly showcase of the company’s latest product innovations.\n\nCustomer service is paramount for brands as poor customer experiences can cost businesses worldwide trillions of dollars every year1. Exceptional customer care starts with meeting customers where they are, and recent research shows that is increasingly social media. In fact, 80% of consumers use social media for customer care more now than they did a year ago and social is Gen Z’s primary channel for customer support2. However, with millions of interactions and data points to sift through, providing timely, personalized care on social is nearly impossible without the help of AI.\n\nThe latest enhancements to Social Customer Care by Sprout Social bring new capabilities and insights to marketers and care teams, helping them transform each customer interaction into a competitive advantage. Associated Messages, for example, give teams access to a full historical view of a case’s public and private messages so they can move accurately and efficiently, while AI-powered Message Intent Classification helps teams resolve the highest-priority messages first. Along with automated case management and upcoming AI capabilities within Salesforce Service Cloud, the updates will help take manual work off care teams’ plates so they can spend time focusing on what matters most: building lasting relationships with customers.\n\n“Social is not just another marketing channel; it’s now the number one non-traditional channel for customer service,” said Erika Trautman, Chief Product Officer, Sprout Social. “Social engagement is the cornerstone of the business-to-consumer relationship and cascades through every aspect of a business. We understand this potential and are continuing to invest in product enhancements that enable teams to work smarter and faster so they can capitalize on every opportunity to delight customers and get the maximum return on their social investments.”\n\nEmerging platforms like Threads, which now boasts over 130 million active users, provide vast opportunities for brands that have the right strategies and solutions in place. New updates to Sprout’s integration with Threads empowers brands to elevate their platform strategies by moderating and replying to Threads comments directly within Sprout’s platform, keeping them on the cutting edge of social and helping them engage their customers no matter where they are.\n\nIn addition to new capabilities and integrations that help marketers work smarter and faster, Sprout’s latest and upcoming product updates include several AI advancements that empower teams to showcase the impact of their work and accelerate data-driven decisions. Some noteworthy examples include:\n\nAnalyze by AI Assist: Offers executive summary insights for reporting widgets, reducing the time it takes to understand the performance of certain widgets while offering curated analysis with AI.\n\nConversation Breakdown Widget: Combines new data lenses like sentiment to give a powerful view of active conversations, making it easier to identify trends and insights faster.\n\nComment Sentiment in Reports: Helps marketers understand how audiences respond to certain content through new positive/negative/neutral comment counts. Gaining insight into the ‘why’ behind performance can help inform future strategy and track how certain campaigns or launches performed.\n\n“Analyze by AI Assist has been a game changer for how I approach content and campaign analysis,” said Erika Bufford, Social Listening and Reporting Assistant, Tesco. “What could previously take me hours of manual effort— such as identifying trends, measuring performance, and generating insights—can now be done in minutes. I couldn’t be happier with the difference it’s made!”\n\nLooking ahead, Sprout will launch LinkedIn integrations that allow brands to directly access LinkedIn DMs through Sprout’s platform and discover new listening data insights. These innovations will help solve critical engagement and reporting challenges facing B2B marketers on the top professional social network.\n\nLearn more about the latest advancements featured in Sprout’s Breaking Ground program here.\n\n1 Source: Qualtrics XM Institute Research from February 2024\n\n2 Source: Sprout Social Q1 2024 Consumer Pulse Survey\n\nAbout Sprout Social\n\nSprout Social is a global leader in social media management and analytics software.
