      "# [Sprout Social by Melissa Flowers on 2018-09-21](https://sproutsocial.com/security/)\nReliability & availability\n\nSprout Social strives to minimize service impacts and downtime. We design our systems for fault tolerance, and our teams are trained for rapid incident recovery. It is in our ethos to avoid downtime at all costs, unplanned or planned. We never impose maintenance downtime if it is avoidable—because it usually is. Elements of business continuity and disaster recovery are woven into our practices and our systems. They are not an afterthought, or a task relegated to a single team.\n\nA proven track-record\n\n99.99% uptime is a key performance indicator (KPI) for our Engineering group. At the time of writing, we had higher than 99.95% uptime over the prior 6 and 12 months.\n\nTransparency to customers\n\nTrust begins with open communication. We publicly share real-time system status and metrics on our Status Websites, https://www.sproutsocialstatus.com for Sprout Social and https://www.sproutadvocacystatus.com for Employee Advocacy. There we communicate incidents and planned maintenance, including any customer impact, and we display system health metrics sourced from independent third-party providers. Customers may subscribe to receive immediate SMS or email notifications of future incidents.\n\nSocial media feeds\n\nOur data ingest layer combines multiple connections to social network APIs. As partners, social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn provide us with higher levels of redundancy and access to their support teams.\n\nBackups\n\nBackups are taken frequently, encrypted in transit and at rest, and are tested regularly. Backups are kept \"off-site\" in Amazon S3 which stores files on multiple physical devices in multiple facilities offering 99.999999999% durability and 99.99% availability.\n\nTransparency to our teams\n\nInternally we practice multidisciplinary, blameless post-mortem analysis, and seek to grow our people, procedures, and systems in the aftermath of failure. Fear is the enemy of progress.\n\nIsolation\n\nOur highly distributed backend platform employs isolation design patterns to mitigate risks across components. Failures of one component rarely affect other components.\n\nRecovery point objectives (RPOs)\n\nRecovery strategies are designed to provide up-to-date RPOs at low Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs), with older data recovered against longer RTOs. This is consistent with customer expectations in Social Media, allowing customers to meet the immediate needs of their customers.\n\nDevOps best practices\n\nOur engineering team practices Infrastructure-as-code, providing correctness, consistency, testability, and speed to recovery. All 24/7/365 on-call team members are empowered to rebuild systems and topologies with full consistency. In the event of system loss, our Engineering team quickly recreates systems by executing the infrastructure code.\n\nMonitoring & on-call support\n\nWe monitor continuously from around the world, displaying, alerting, and reporting upon our entire technical environments in real-time. Supporting customers is a collaboration between our customer-facing support team and our engineering team. Specialized engineers are on call 24/7/365.\n\nWhen problems occur our teams are promptly notified, automatically provided with context, and are enabled with tools to help collaborate efficiently with peers. We employ a triage pager system to ensure alerts quickly and reliably reach engineers.\n\nEncryption at rest & in transit\n\nAll communications over public networks with Sprout Social’s application and API utilize HTTPS with TLS 1.2 or higher enforced. All data is stored encrypted-at-rest with AES-256 or greater, including backups.\n\nSystem administration\n\nBest practices are utilized, such as least privilege, central configuration management, and stringent host and network firewall policies. Servers are patched automatically on a regular schedule, with high-priority patches applied manually out-of-cycle.\n\nThird party risk management\n\nSprout Social reviews the security posture of our critical third party product and service providers on a regular basis. Sprout Social's subprocessors are contractually required to adhere to an established set of security measures that align with industry best practices.\n\nInformation security policies & standards\n\nSprout Social has implemented a strong information security management system through a comprehensive set of policies and standards covering all aspects of security and privacy. All Employees must affirm their responsibilities in protecting customer data as part of their condition of employment.\n\nSecure support protocols\n\nOur world-class Support team follows phishing and threat-resistant protocols designed by our Security team, when conducting sensitive actions on customer accounts.\n\nOffices\n\nSprout Social offices are secured by keycard access. Office networks are segmented, centrally monitored, and protected by firewalls and Intrusion Prevention devices. Our products have no dependencies on our company’s offices or other facilities we manage.\n\nDevices\n\nAll Sprout Social devices are inventoried with asset tags and managed with a central mobile device management (MDM) solution.\n\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA)\n\nAccount owners and administrators may require that their users leverage this additional security layer. Sprout Social supports apps like Google Authenticator and others that implement the Time-based One-time Password Algorithm (TOTP) or HMAC-based One-time Password Algorithm (HOTP) for generating passcodes.\n\nSecure credential storage\n\nAccount passwords are salted and hashed using the latest strong algorithms and approaches, which are routinely audited. No human, our staff included, can ever view them. If you lose your password, it can't be recovered and must be reset.\n\nBrute-force protections\n\nIn addition to computationally challenging hashing, our authentication services implement additional rate-limiting protections and ReCAPTCHA.\n\nApproval workflows\n\nAccount Owners and Administrators may restrict certain activities behind approval workflows. These allow for tasks to be divided amongst a team, with the peace of mind that central decision makers may review and control public-facing actions.\n\nIP restrictions\n\nSprout Social may be configured to restrict application and API access from specific IP ranges.\n\nSingle sign-on (SSO)\n\nSprout Social offers SAML 2.0 Single sign-on (SSO) for organizations that leverage this authentication service to give employees one set of login credentials to access multiple applications. Our engineering team works with customers to implement custom SSO integrations across both web and mobile.\n\nEmail signing\n\nSprout Social implements Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) to ensure emails we send are authenticated as coming from Sprout Social, helping to prevent spoofing and ensure authenticity.\n\nAccess permissions\n\nAccount Owners and Administrators may restrict access to profiles, features, actions (including read and write), and other data, by applying granular controls to users on their account.\n\nGlobal publishing pause\n\nIn times of crisis, your team has access to one button that temporarily disables any automated scheduled and queued messages from being sent by Sprout Social. This is accessible from our web and mobile applications.\n\nCustomer protection\n\nSprout Social wants to help you protect yourself from online security threats and have created resources designed to do that, including Security Best Practices and Protecting sensitive information.",

It also shows benchmarking and has a good Instagram competitor benchmarking (although I wish they had this for all platforms!) \n\nI don't like the main post crafting section compared to sprout social or loomly. This is because you can't adjust the post to fit with different platform requirements. So you'd have to either create one post to all platforms and not have it adjusted for each platform (tags, hashtags, character limit etc). OR create the same post 3 or 4 times over for different platforms.\n\nWith other tools I've used you can individually tweak within the one post.

Are you an individual looking to manage a few accounts yourself, or do you need a solution for collaborating with a team? Do you need robust analytics and reporting, or is basic scheduling and publishing sufficient? Answering these types of questions will help narrow down the best fit.  \nA few tools that I've used personally and would recommend based on different scenarios include:  \n1. For individuals or solopreneurs on a budget, Buffer is a great free option that allows scheduling posts in advance to multiple networks. It has all the essential features one needs without a steep learning curve.  \n2. SocialPilot provides a good balance of features and affordability for small businesses looking for more functionality.

There is no magic solution for massive follower growth other than really engaging content, viral posts etc. Things that you likely already knew of.\n\nWith companies like this, it's nearly always bot followers, and that will tank your engagement and profile growth long term. It's just not worth it. \n\nSome of you mentioned Sprout Social, a different company to these scammers. They are social scheduling tool (allowing you to schedule posts, get reports and the like). They are actually currently the best on the market imo, so it's no wonder these scammers are trying to piggy back on their brand, like others have mentioned I'd be surprised if this lasts long. \n\nSprout Social aren't cheap if anyone was considering it, however for something less doom and gloom they do have a free resource and blog section on their site which has loads of helpful guides and templates that may well help with your social growth! (I'm not sponsored by them I promise!)\n\nFinally, the last thing I wanted to say is that while we all would love 100,000+ followers, please do not stress too hard about it. Follower growth is a great goal to have but doesn't necessarily do anything for your business on its own. I always recommend focusing on the followers / community you already have to get them to really engage with your content. Do that, and the growth will come, I promise! \n\nI'm sure all of your businesses are awesome. You don't need these scammers!\n\nPeace out\n\n### Comment ID ktf0guj with +1 score by [(Dillbert90, Reddit, 2024-03-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/159abm1/anyone_heard_of_sprouty_social/ktf0guj/) (in reply to ID kie9cg6):\nThanks for sharing!

It's great for scheduling but their insights are VERY basic. It's been something I've pushed them on for years but it hasn't improved much.\n\nIf you're cool managing the analytics part through other tools and looking for pure ease of use then Buffer is the way to go. If you want a single product that'll do both scheduling and reporting, with a bit of extra work, I'd go the Sprout route.\n\n## Comment ID d43dvpq with +2 score by [(Xandaline, Reddit, 2016-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/4ncqdc/buffer_v_sprout_social/d43dvpq/) (in reply to ID 4ncqdc):\nI used SproutSocial for my agency for about 6 months and left for Buffer.  The primary reason for switching is that when it comes to posting content, it's unbeatable.\n\nBuffer is a product that is great if your team is OK with using multiple tools to service a client's social media marketing needs.  The API and integrations make this an excellent tool if you've got some tech skills to use the data they collect to create reports yourself.  Of course there are product like DashThis that fill that gap if you aren't a coder.\n\nIf you want a one size fits all tool to manage posting,  social mentions, etc.. in one interface,  Sprout is your solution.  In fact I greatly miss the Inbox that would collect all the social mentions into one place.  I have yet to find a replacement for that feature.\n\nIf you want a rock solid posting tool and a way to manage your evergreen content for near automated re-promotion, go with Buffer.  \n\nAnd, yes; the price is a factor.  I asked Sprout for 5 more profiles and they quoted me a laughable amount.  Not figuratively, literally laughably expensive.\n\nIf you do go with Buffer,  augment it with something like Mention.net and DashThis.\n\n## Comment ID d42t065 with +2 score by [(melissadingmon, Reddit, 2016-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/4ncqdc/buffer_v_sprout_social/d42t065/) (in reply to ID 4ncqdc):\n\"Hootsuite is garbage\" = upvote.\n\n## Comment ID d42w60z with +2 score by [(SproutRachael, Reddit, 2016-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/4ncqdc/buffer_v_sprout_social/d42w60z/) (in reply to ID 4ncqdc):\nHey, Megan. My name is Rachael. I love this post, great questions. Full disclosure: I work for Sprout. However, like you i've been using the platform for years. Long before I ever started working here. I've been an independent social media manager for a variety of businesses for over 6 years, but was always a team of one. I never understood how important all the team capabilities and functions were in sprout until i actually got here and became part of a larger team. For what it's worth, i highly recommend you take a good look at all the team functionality. IMHO there is very little out there that compares. Feel free to reach out to me if you'd rather. I know that didn't answer your question about buffer in entirety, but I thought I had some relevant insight. Anywho, happy to help with anything Sprout and good luck.

I think a lot of this depends on how you use social media. If social activity has to show a solid ROI then you need a tool that does the analytics and tagging well, if it's a publisher then speed and ease of use will be a big factor, if it's for customer service then you need something that can integrate with CRM and also allow assignment to team members. Currently I'm working on large in-house social accounts so not sure how relevant this would be but we use Socialbakers builder platform which looks a bit hootsuite-ish and does some pretty neat reporting, listening and analysis as well allowing team collaboration.\n\n## Comment ID d42xto1 with +1 score by [(b00mtown, Reddit, 2016-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/4ncqdc/buffer_v_sprout_social/d42xto1/) (in reply to ID 4ncqdc):\nSprout is the best.

Sprinklr beats all those options hands down. It offers power years beyond what any of them will be able to develop in the next 5.\n\nSprout looks nice and has pretty reports but it's nowhere in the same realm as Sprinklr when it comes to offering for large enterprise.\n\nWe have more than 1200 company accounts and over 10k employees managing their social presences through Sprinkler. You simply can't do that with Buffer, HootSuite, or Sprout.\n\nWhile I use Buffer constantly each day for managing a couple dozen personal and business accounts and have a Sprout account they provide for me which I use from time to time, there's no question which route I'd go if I was managing a large social project. Though if you're just a small agency with a couple clients and small social programs, I can see how Sprinklr may be too much. It's for enterprise social while the others aren't. Really an apples to oranges.\n\n#### Comment ID d43y72z with +1 score by [(b00mtown, Reddit, 2016-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/4ncqdc/buffer_v_sprout_social/d43y72z/) (in reply to ID d434zhk):\nI am at a medium creative agency with international clients. As a one person social department you have totally hit the nail on the head. Sprinklr represents the hopes and dreams of my client, which has thousands of locations worldwide that they someday hope to have all connected through the platform. In the very long meantime I am stuck running a motocross race in a dump truck. \n\nI am impressed with Sprinklr in a lot of ways, but running point on engagement makes the terrible UI stand out. Once the client realizes they need an internal team to start managing some of their social, it will get better and I will probably enjoy using Sprinklr more. \n\nThat being said, I have run very large scale social projects with Sprinklr in the past (another agency, tool dictated by clients) and Sprinklr has absolutely shit the bed on me. Reps promised what they couldn't deliver and in the 11th hour I had to rely on other tools. \n\nSprinklr is a great tool for client side social depts. I think agencies who really want to build out social should rely on a constellation of tools to get the best product. All tools promise a one-stop shop and all tools are awful at at least 1 thing (if not more). Sprinklr is no exception. \n\nEDIT: I should add that this is how I feel. This is my opinion. People can second guess my agency's roster, experience, my inability to learn/use the tool etc. but at the end of the day when I log in to the desktop or app, I am not impressed with how the tool functions or the choices Sprinklr has made.\n\n### Comment ID d435wtq with +1 score by [(PotatoFirelord, Reddit, 2016-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/4ncqdc/buffer_v_sprout_social/d435wtq/) (in reply to ID d42xto1):\nI'm also curious to know what you dont like about Sprinklr.

We've been on Metricool for a few months. Criminally under-rated. Great pricing too.

We're just too small to introduce these really elaborate ways of working like stacked ranked priorities, workstreams, phase gates, etc. This is going to create a more political environment and encourage turf building in those who have been hired from companies like Amazon where that is encouraged. \n\nThere is no way you are going to be able to hire all of these new VPs of product management in any reasonable amount of time to fill all of these new positions you created after decimating the existing product management org. Bring back the senior PMs and let them grow into the roles you need. \n\nThe cynical side of me says the difficulty filling these positions and the promised new platform engineer positions is a feature, not a bug to not spend any more money but make it look like we're doing okay as a company with all of these open positions. This is the classic definition of \"ghost job\".",

          "cons": "- Sprout values and culture are more of a vibe than \"this is how we work\". This is an effort ongoing to relaunch the values next year but I am suspicious that this is going to be a \"rules for thee, not for me\" especially after how the 10% R&amp;D layoffs were handled (laying people off by email is pretty low). \n- Most leadership have not had much experience outside of Sprout, let alone a company as large as Sprout so there is a lot of on the job training going on which explains how the transition to focusing on enterprise customers was botched so badly. We tried to warn leadership that selling to enterprise customers is more elaborate than just \"hands on keyboards\" but any questions about the approach were dismissed during all-hands. There is a certain level of rose colored glasses in everything that happens at Sprout. We had layoffs but you'd would think that Sprout had their best year ever from the comments made during all-hands meetings. \n- Calibrations and promotions in R&amp;D are not objective. Get on the bad side of a principle engineer and they will tank your career at Sprout. If your manager doesn't fight for you, you won't get a promotion and won't get calibrated properly which affects your salary since Sprout doesn't do cost of living adjustments and very rarely does market adjustments. \n- \"Staff Software Engineer\" is a terminal career band at Sprout. Nobody gets promoted from Staff to anything above it unless you've been an engineering manager or director previously and you are stepping away from a manager role back to an IC role. This wouldn't be so bad but the salary band is narrow, not allowing for growth in the band still assuming that you'd grow out of that band to be able to get a raise. \n- Speaking of raises, we thought compensation was going to improve with annual equity refreshes taking the place of cost of living adjustments but they've already started to walk back the annual equity grants. I would not be surprised after our 2024 performance that there aren't any annual equity grants in 2025, they already tried to tamp down expectations in 2024.\n- We're constantly asked to do more with less. We're not back filling attrition unless we can \"back fill\" that position with an ASE. We're having to beg to get budget to be able to just have proper logging in our services to be able to debug properly. We'd rather have a senior engineer spend weeks trying to squeeze out performance from a service than just spend the few hundred dollars extra a month for horizontal scaling.",

While I understand the need for adjustments, it's disheartening to see the lack of corresponding measures for employees. The absence of cost of living increases, bonuses, or annual raises has left many of us grappling with financial challenges. It's especially frustrating when juxtaposed with the fact that the C-suite receives annual raises. This raises the question: When will the company demonstrate, through tangible actions and financial considerations, that they genuinely prioritize the well-being of all employees? The company proudly claims to be \"people first,\" but the reality seems to lean more towards a \"C-suite leadership first\" approach. For a truly people-centric organization, it's essential that actions align with words. Addressing inflation on the employee's end, providing fair and timely increases, and ensuring that everyone feels the positive impact of the company's success would go a long way in fostering a culture of trust and support.",

You can avoid this by just communicating better and clearly stating organizational goals and personal goals. Stop worrying about how the truth sounds and start telling it to folks. Listen to people and get feedback. Don't launch projects without consulting people who do those jobs",

Most people here do not work very hard and they take pride in this as a company promotes this work ethic. It is frustrating to work with people who don't do their end. Upper management promotes empathy, but only empathy for them, which is odd. My experience was that they did not care about the employee experience, just the experience of a few people. They do not have their thump on what is going on inside their own company. There are some really bad people here in senior management. You should steer clear of working here.",

It also felt like feedback fell on deaf ears, and whenever feedback was submitted, it didn't matter at all. My biggest feedback is that Support feels like the red-headed stepchild of the company. There's always this pressure to meet metrics and when you mention you feel burnt out, they tell you to have a \"growth mindset\". Whenever there are company events or R&amp;R days, you can't actually take advantage of that because someone has to be scheduled to work to meet these impossible goals/metrics. You're expected to be a team player and say yes to increasing tasks or schedule changes, even if your workload is heavy. This adds onto more pressure and if you try to set boundaries (like they encourage), you're given negative feedback. After some turnover of more tenured employees (which is telling), it felt like nothing was done to boost team morale and we were still held to an impossibly high standard. All in all, Sprout is probably a great company to work for but the Support team is not.",

People are extremely entitled and more and more enabled to behave like corporate bullies. Even people I once considered friends are showing me sides of themselves that shock me. This probably is due to the fact that our leadership team feels very absent, so to make up for it, people really are trying to prove their place and pave the way for their own success, or they're so stressed they're taking it out on others. It's become a \"what's in it for me\" culture. The things that drew me to the company years ago are gone. I understand change is inevitable and I support change in general, but these issues are cracks in our very DNA, not just a byproduct of being a larger and more international team moving at quick speeds. There's no accountability and now it feels often like we're running in circles.\n\nPay is also extremely low. When I talk to peers outside Sprout, but in the exact same role, they're all getting at least 30% higher base pay, have better benefits, and earn cash bonuses. Leadership has been challenged on staying competitive with compensation again and again, and look the other way. RSUs that vest in a few years are not enough in this economy, especially when stock prices aren't guaranteed and are influenced by outside factors we have no control over. My bills continue to increase but I won't ever get a penny more in salary until I'm promoted, and even then it'll be a small bump. Overall, the company feels really cheap and like it's a pain to spend any money for needs the team has.",

Sprout has traditionally been unique because of the incredible inbound funnel for sales teams. Inbound has dried up and all teams are expected to outbound, which is normal across the market. However, there's lots of ambiguity, a lack of team and individual coaching, extreme pressure to hit metrics, and monthly quotas, and 1 bad quarter will put you on a performance plan, with no remorse or consideration of previous success. Unfortunately, managers are not experienced in cold calling, and sales teams' morale is extremely low. Sprout sales teams' compensation is relatively low and since most are not hitting quota anymore, the base compensation is not as competitive either.",

Ultimately, it mirrors the typical experience at any other company I've worked for. Advancement hinges on the favor of a select few individuals whose opinions carry weight; regardless of your achievements, if they harbor reservations or prefer someone else, progress stalls. Often, these decision-makers are detached from your day-to-day reality. Consequently, your manager's feedback and peer evaluations hold little sway. The final decisions are conveyed with vague and subjective feedback, often at odds with the content of previous one-on-one discussions throughout the year.\n\n- pay directly linked to career progress -\nIf your career stalls, so does your salary. Coupled with prevalent favoritism, this dynamic means your earnings may not keep pace with inflation unless you cater to the whims of the influential few.\n\n- fragile egos -\nMany individuals in crucial decision-making roles have tenure rather than merit as the basis of their positions. Among them, there exists a prevalence of delicate egos, potentially stemming from imposter syndrome. Correcting or disagreeing with them—even failing to express sufficient enthusiasm for their ideas—can easily cause offense. In such instances, it's often best to seek opportunities elsewhere, as your career prospects within the organization may become limited.\n\nThese dynamics cast Sprouts' values in a dubious light, revealing them as mere illusions. When the facade of objectivity fades, morale inevitably declines. Consequently, employees tend to disengage, merely going through the motions, or they decide to leave the organization altogether.",

It also felt like feedback fell on deaf ears, and whenever feedback was submitted, it didn't matter at all. My biggest feedback is that Support feels like the red-headed stepchild of the company. There's always this pressure to meet metrics and when you mention you feel burnt out, they tell you to have a \"growth mindset\". Whenever there are company events or R&amp;R days, you can't actually take advantage of that because someone has to be scheduled to work to meet these impossible goals/metrics. You're expected to be a team player and say yes to increasing tasks or schedule changes, even if your workload is heavy. This adds onto more pressure and if you try to set boundaries (like they encourage), you're given negative feedback. After some turnover of more tenured employees (which is telling), it felt like nothing was done to boost team morale and we were still held to an impossibly high standard.

Upper management promotes empathy, but only empathy for them, which is odd. My experience was that they did not care about the employee experience, just the experience of a few people.

While I understand the need for adjustments, it's disheartening to see the lack of corresponding measures for employees. The absence of cost of living increases, bonuses, or annual raises has left many of us grappling with financial challenges. It's especially frustrating when juxtaposed with the fact that the C-suite receives annual raises. This raises the question: When will the company demonstrate, through tangible actions and financial considerations, that they genuinely prioritize the well-being of all employees? The company proudly claims to be \"people first,\" but the reality seems to lean more towards a \"C-suite leadership first\" approach. For a truly people-centric organization, it's essential that actions align with words. Addressing inflation on the employee's end, providing fair and timely increases, and ensuring that everyone feels the positive impact of the company's success would go a long way in fostering a culture of trust and support.",

        "cons": "Sprout no longer feels like we're all in this together or we're one team working toward one goal. People are extremely entitled and more and more enabled to behave like corporate bullies. Even people I once considered friends are showing me sides of themselves that shock me. This probably is due to the fact that our leadership team feels very absent, so to make up for it, people really are trying to prove their place and pave the way for their own success, or they're so stressed they're taking it out on others. It's become a \"what's in it for me\" culture. The things that drew me to the company years ago are gone. I understand change is inevitable and I support change in general, but these issues are cracks in our very DNA, not just a byproduct of being a larger and more international team moving at quick speeds. There's no accountability and now it feels often like we're running in circles.\n\nPay is also extremely low. When I talk to peers outside Sprout, but in the exact same role, they're all getting at least 30% higher base pay, have better benefits, and earn cash bonuses. Leadership has been challenged on staying competitive with compensation again and again, and look the other way. RSUs that vest in a few years are not enough in this economy, especially when stock prices aren't guaranteed and are influenced by outside factors we have no control over. My bills continue to increase but I won't ever get a penny more in salary until I'm promoted, and even then it'll be a small bump.

With the influx of new voices from outside and their placement in leadership roles, there's a growing acknowledgment of the flaws in the performance review system. However, a significant hurdle remains: these leaders lack the autonomy to make independent decisions. Instead, they must persuade uninformed yet supposedly pivotal decision-makers. It's time to abandon this excessive micromanagement and entrust the frontline leaders with the authority to determine who merits advancement and who does not.",
        "cons": "rank favoritism\nCareer progress documentation is abundant, but reviews are protracted affairs involving numerous meetings. Ultimately, it mirrors the typical experience at any other company I've worked for. Advancement hinges on the favor of a select few individuals whose opinions carry weight; regardless of your achievements, if they harbor reservations or prefer someone else, progress stalls. Often, these decision-makers are detached from your day-to-day reality. Consequently, your manager's feedback and peer evaluations hold little sway. The final decisions are conveyed with vague and subjective feedback, often at odds with the content of previous one-on-one discussions throughout the year.\n\n- pay directly linked to career progress -\nIf your career stalls, so does your salary. Coupled with prevalent favoritism, this dynamic means your earnings may not keep pace with inflation unless you cater to the whims of the influential few.\n\n- fragile egos -\nMany individuals in crucial decision-making roles have tenure rather than merit as the basis of their positions. Among them, there exists a prevalence of delicate egos, potentially stemming from imposter syndrome. Correcting or disagreeing with them—even failing to express sufficient enthusiasm for their ideas—can easily cause offense. In such instances, it's often best to seek opportunities elsewhere, as your career prospects within the organization may become limited.\n\nThese dynamics cast Sprouts' values in a dubious light, revealing them as mere illusions. When the facade of objectivity fades, morale inevitably declines. Consequently, employees tend to disengage, merely going through the motions, or they decide to leave the organization altogether.",

We're just too small to introduce these really elaborate ways of working like stacked ranked priorities, workstreams, phase gates, etc. This is going to create a more political environment and encourage turf building in those who have been hired from companies like Amazon where that is encouraged. \n\nThere is no way you are going to be able to hire all of these new VPs of product management in any reasonable amount of time to fill all of these new positions you created after decimating the existing product management org. Bring back the senior PMs and let them grow into the roles you need. \n\nThe cynical side of me says the difficulty filling these positions and the promised new platform engineer positions is a feature, not a bug to not spend any more money but make it look like we're doing okay as a company with all of these open positions.

        "cons": "- Sprout values and culture are more of a vibe than \"this is how we work\". This is an effort ongoing to relaunch the values next year but I am suspicious that this is going to be a \"rules for thee, not for me\" especially after how the 10% R&amp;D layoffs were handled (laying people off by email is pretty low). \n- Most leadership have not had much experience outside of Sprout, let alone a company as large as Sprout so there is a lot of on the job training going on which explains how the transition to focusing on enterprise customers was botched so badly. We tried to warn leadership that selling to enterprise customers is more elaborate than just \"hands on keyboards\" but any questions about the approach were dismissed during all-hands. There is a certain level of rose colored glasses in everything that happens at Sprout. We had layoffs but you'd would think that Sprout had their best year ever from the comments made during all-hands meetings. \n- Calibrations and promotions in R&amp;D are not objective. Get on the bad side of a principle engineer and they will tank your career at Sprout. If your manager doesn't fight for you, you won't get a promotion and won't get calibrated properly which affects your salary since Sprout doesn't do cost of living adjustments and very rarely does market adjustments. \n- \"Staff Software Engineer\" is a terminal career band at Sprout. Nobody gets promoted from Staff to anything above it unless you've been an engineering manager or director previously and you are stepping away from a manager role back to an IC role. This wouldn't be so bad but the salary band is narrow, not allowing for growth in the band still assuming that you'd grow out of that band to be able to get a raise. \n- Speaking of raises, we thought compensation was going to improve with annual equity refreshes taking the place of cost of living adjustments but they've already started to walk back the annual equity grants. I would not be surprised after our 2024 performance that there aren't any annual equity grants in 2025, they already tried to tamp down expectations in 2024.\n- We're constantly asked to do more with less. We're not back filling attrition unless we can \"back fill\" that position with an ASE. We're having to beg to get budget to be able to just have proper logging in our services to be able to debug properly. We'd rather have a senior engineer spend weeks trying to squeeze out performance from a service than just spend the few hundred dollars extra a month for horizontal scaling.",

      "# [50+ Must-know social media marketing statistics for 2024 by Chloe West on 2024-02-08](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-statistics/)\nDiscover the latest social media statistics to refine your strategy, uncover new opportunities and stay ahead in 2024.\n\nReading time 8 minutes\n\nPublished on February 8, 2024\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSummary\n\nIn 2024, there are estimated to be 5.17 billion total social media users worldwide, with an average person using 6.7 different social networks per month.\n\nSocial media advertising spend is projected to reach $219.8 billion in 2024, with mobile generating $255.8 billion of this total by 2028.\n\nVideo content continues to be popular, with 44% of people preferring to learn about new products through short video content and 87% of marketers reporting increased sales from video marketing.\n\nIf you’re trying to improve your social media marketing strategy, understanding key industry statistics is the perfect starting point.\n\nSocial media statistics give you valuable insight into who your audience is, their interests and habits, as well as the state of the industry as a whole. This data helps you tailor your marketing strategies to boost engagement and ROI.\n\nStats can also help you benchmark your own performance within your industry and even uncover new opportunities.\n\nUse the social media marketing statistics below to guide your presence in 2024 and beyond.\n\nSocial media usage statistics\n\nIt’s no secret that we’re all glued to social media (my screen time data supports this). To get a better idea of how glued users are, let's look at some social media usage statistics.\n\nBelow is a quick snapshot of how social media demographics and usage are changing, which networks are winning and how hooked consumers are on social.\n\nIn 2024, there are estimated to be 5.17 billion total social media users worldwide.\n\nThe average person uses 6.7 different social networks per month.\n\nThe amount of time internet users spend on social media declined slightly to 143 minutes per day.\n\nTikTok is the fastest-growing platform with a staggering 100% user growth rate between 2020 and 2022. And between Q3 2022 and Q3 2023, TikTok's monthly active users grew 13%.\n\nThe number of social media users worldwide grew by 320 million people from January 2023 to January 2024.\n\nGrowth may seem slow, but that's due to the sheer number of people who already use social media. This means social media presents a huge opportunity for marketers and advertisers.\n\nHowever, with users spread across several platforms, it’s more important than ever for brands to take a multi-channel approach. Don't forget to leverage emerging platforms like TikTok to reach new audiences and stand out from the competition.\n\nSocial media advertising statistics\n\nAs organic reach decreases on nearly every platform, paid social media advertising becomes a must-use strategy for reaching your target audience. Learn more about social advertising stats to inform your strategy.\n\nTotal spend on social media advertising is projected to reach $219.8 billion in 2024.\n\nIt's now projected that $255.8 billion of total social media ad spending will be generated through mobile by 2028.\n\nTotal ad spend growth is anticipated at 6.1% in 2024.\n\nSocial media ads account for 28.8% of all digital advertising spend.\n\nBusinesses put around 8.7% of their total revenue towards their ads budget.\n\nSocial media ad spend is growing at a steady rate. With more marketers investing in ads, brands should get ready to allocate bigger budgets to paid marketing strategies to compete.\n\nFacebook statistics\n\nFacebook remains an advertising powerhouse. Whether or not brands should focus on Facebook is a tough question that really depends on your individual Facebook metrics. The following Facebook statistics can clue you in further.\n\nFacebook is the most-used platform by marketers worldwide (89%). Instagram sits in second place (80%).\n\nAs of Q3 2023, Facebook is the largest online social network in the world with roughly 3.05 billion monthly active users.\n\nThe average American spends about 31 minutes per day on Facebook.\n\n56.3% of Facebook users are male and 43.7% are female (based on available gender data).\n\nAlmost a quarter of Facebook users in the US are between the ages 25-34.\n\nFacebook remains a favorite among marketers. That’s not surprising, considering the massive reach offered by the platform. Plus, the increasing average age means more users are in high-level, decision-making positions in their careers.\n\nInstagram statistics\n\nInstagram boasts 2 billion actively monthly users and yet brands are still scrambling to get more Instagram followers. Below are the top social media statistics for Instagram.\n\nInstagram ties with Facebook for the social media platform with the highest ROI.\n\n27.4% of US Instagram users are between 25 and 34 years old.\n\n61.1% of total Instagram users worldwide are between the ages 18-34, and mostly identify as male.\n\nInstagram Reels generate more likes and saves, but fewer comments than regular posts.\n\nInstagram’s engagement rates are four times higher than Facebook (0.60% to 0.15%), but engagement has become more competitive each year.\n\nIn 2023, 43% of marketers plan to increase their investment in Instagram.\n\nOnce the go-to social platform for influencers, Instagram is facing competition from TikTok.\n\nStill, relatively high engagement rates, fresh ecommerce features and big ad spending signal that the future is still bright for Instagram.\n\nLinkedIn statistics\n\nLinkedIn has done a brilliant job of carving out its niche as the go-to professional network. The platform is a potential goldmine for B2B brands and the rapid growth of their ad platform speaks for itself. Here are some LinkedIn statistics you should know.\n\nThere are more than more than 1 billion members across 200 countries on LinkedIn.\n\nThe United States has the highest user rate in the world on LinkedIn with an audience reach of over 214 million users.\n\nThere are over 67 million company profiles on LinkedIn.\n\n60% of worldwide users are between ages 25 and 34 years old, far exceeding any other age group.\n\nSpurred by the widespread career changes over the past two years, the platform doesn’t look to slow down any time soon. Hint: now’s the time to level up your LinkedIn marketing if you’re in B2B.\n\nPinterest statistics\n\nPinterest often doesn’t get its due when it comes to social platforms. The platform’s diverse, big-spending audience is among the most dedicated and engaged of any network. Here are some top Pinterest statistics to look out for.\n\n482 million people use Pinterest every month.\n\n76.2% of Pinterest users are women, 17.2% are men and 6.6% are unspecified.\n\nIn December 2023 alone, nearly 1.2 billion visits were measured to Pinterest.com, from desktop and mobile.\n\n76.2% of worldwide Pinterest users identify as female.\n\nPinterest is the third-most visited social media website in the US.\n\n80% of weekly users have found a new brand or product on the platform.\n\nThe power of Pinterest advertising is well-documented and the platform is the perfect place to uncover new products. Also, marketers targeting a US audience would do well to include Pinterest in their marketing efforts.\n\nTikTok statistics\n\nTikTok has totally transformed itself to a must-have digital platform for brands. The platform’s rabid fanbase, rapid growth and sky-high usage spell great news for early adopters. Below are some interesting TikTok statistics to know about.\n\nTikTok is expected to reach over 2 billion users in 2024.\n\nTikTok is the most frequently used app worldwide, with Android phone users spending an average of 34 hours per month on the platform.\n\nTikTok’s user base skews female, with 48% of users identifying as women (based on available gender data.)\n\n36.7% of TikTok users are 18-24 years old and account for the largest share of TikTok’s advertising audience.\n\nTikTok is the second-most used video entertainment app by monthly active users.\n\nYounger consumers and smaller influencers dominate the platform right now, but that may change in the very near future. If you’re already on the platform, make sure to watch your TikTok analytics and how to reach your audience ASAP.\n\nX (formerly Twitter) statistics\n\nX, formerly Twitter, has cemented itself as the hub of political discussions, memes and a prime place to go back and forth with brands. Take a look at the Twitter statistics below to understand more about marketing on the platform.\n\nX boasts about 619 million monthly active users in total worldwide.\n\n53% of X users use the platform to get the latest news.\n\nMore than half (63%) of X users are men (based on available gender data).\n\n33% of users plan to spend less time on X in 2024.\n\nUS adults spend an average of 34.1 minutes daily on X.\n\nEven with the uncertainty of Z's future because of its last year, the platform appears to be growing, so marketers may not want to count it out yet.\n\nYouTube statistics\n\nTo compete with emerging platforms like TikTok, the second-largest search engine in the world is making some big changes. Here are the top YouTube statistics to know about.\n\nAs of January 2023, YouTube has nearly 2.5 billion users worldwide.\n\nYouTube Shorts has 2 billion monthly active users.\n\nYouTube's biggest gender segments are males aged between 25-34 (12.2%), and males aged between 35-44 (9.6%) (based on available gender data).\n\nYouTube users spend an average of 28 hours, 5 minutes on the Android app each month.\n\nNearly 90% of all visits to YouTube come from a mobile device.\n\nDespite the platforms in the market, YouTube is still users’ go-to video-sharing and video-consumption platform. With more people accessing the app on mobile, marketers would benefit from posting more short-form, vertical content (i.e. Shorts) on the platform.\n\nSocial media video statistics\n\nVideo continues to be an all-time favorite content type. It’s versatile, engaging and offers excellent ROI to marketers worldwide. Let’s look at some recent social media video statistics.\n\n44% of people prefer to learn about a new product or service via short video content.\n\n87% of marketers say video marketing has directly increased sales.\n\nShort-form video offers marketers the highest ROI of any social media marketing strategy, with 30-60 videos seeing the most success.\n\nUS video advertising is expected to increase from $76.97 billion in 2023 to $84.61 billion in 2024.\n\nVideo is making its way into all types of marketing strategies in virtually every industry. However, it’s evolving in its shape and form. Brands can expect to see better results from short-form video content that’s primarily entertaining and/or funny.\n\nInfluencer marketing statistics\n\nWorking with influencers is one of the best inbound marketing strategies being used today. Here are some influencer marketing statistics about which platforms marketers are leveraging, what they’re hoping to achieve and how they plan to execute influencer marketing in the future.\n\n50.1% of marketers believe TikTok offers the highest ROI to influencer marketers for short-form video content, followed by 29.9% of marketers saying Instagram Reels and 12% saying YouTube Shorts.\n\n69% of marketers use TikTok for influencer marketing, making it the most popular influencer marketing channel.\n\nGenerating more engagement, reaching new audiences and strengthening community are the top three marketing goals for working with creators.\n\n60% of marketers plan to spend more on influencer marketing campaigns in 2024.\n\n63% of marketers plan to use AI in launching their influencer campaigns. And 55% of these brands will use AI for identifying influencers.\n\nMore marketers are realizing the potential of influencer marketing. If influencers are not already part of your marketing efforts, it’s time to switch your focus. The key is to pick the best platforms and influencers for your brand, both of which can be automated using the right tools.\n\nConsumer behavior statistics\n\nThe concept of buying something you saw on social media is nothing new. From product recommendations to first impressions from brands, the impact of social media on consumers is well-documented. Learn more from these consumer behavior statistics.\n\n56.1% of internet users purchase a product online at least once a week.\n\n29.9% of internet users purchase a product using their mobile devices at least once a week.\n\n51.2% of people research brands online before making a purchase.\n\nThe biggest online purchase drivers across all ages are free shipping, coupons and discounts, or an easy return policy.\n\nThe recent growth of direct social sales is notable. Consumers likewise crave authenticity and ads that don’t feel like ads. But the key to selling on social is to know your customer, which platforms they prefer and how their unique buying behavior works.\n\nSocial Media Statistics FAQ\n\nWhat is the most used social media platform?\n\nThe most-used social media platform is Facebook with over 3 billion users. Facebook is followed by YouTube (2.94 billion users), WhatsApp and Instagram (tied at 2 billion users).\n\nIs social media use increasing?\n\nSocial media use is increasing year-over-year, albeit slowly. However, due to the saturation of use, this slow growth isn’t surprising.\n\nIs social media marketing still effective?\n\nYes! There are over 5 billion social media user identities, meaning 62.3% of the population has created at least one social media account. That’s a massive potential reach. As long as you create the right strategy and target the right people, you should see success with social media marketing.\n\nAdditional resources for Social Media Statistics\n\nCategories\n\nWebinar\n\nFrom Pins to Leads: How Pictures Turn into Profit\n\nCategories\n\nSocial Media Analytics\n\nSocial Media Strategy\n\n40 Twitter (X) stats to know in marketing in 2024\n\nPublished on May 22, 2024 • Reading time 9 minutes\n\nCategories\n\nPinterest\n\nSocial Media Publishing\n\n24 must-know Pinterest stats for marketers in 2024\n\nPublished on March 27, 2024 • Reading time 7 minutes\n\nCategories\n\nSocial Media Content\n\nVideo\n\n50+ Social Media Video Marketing Statistics for 2024\n\nPublished on March 26, 2024 • Reading time 8 minutes\n\nCategories\n\nSocial Media Trends\n\nYouTube\n\n25 YouTube stats marketers should know in 2024 [Updated]\n\nPublished on March 20, 2024 • Reading time 7 minutes\n\nCategories\n\nFacebook\n\nSocial Media Trends\n\n24 Facebook statistics marketers should know in 2024\n\nPublished on March 19, 2024 • Reading time 8 minutes\n\nCategories\n\nSocial Media Strategy\n\nSocial Media Trends\n\n27 TikTok statistics marketers need to know in 2024\n\nPublished on February 20, 2024 • Reading time 7 minutes\n\nCategories\n\nSocial Media Trends\n\n50+ Must-know social media marketing statistics for 2024\n\nPublished on February 8, 2024 • Reading time 8 minutes\n\nCategories\n\nLinkedIn\n\nSocial Media Trends\n\nLinkedIn statistics for marketers in 2024\n\nPublished on February 28, 2023 • Reading time 10 minutes\n\nCategories\n\nSocial Media Strategy\n\n5 stats brands need to know to engage Irish & UK consumers\n\nPublished on July 18, 2019 • Reading time 4 minutes\n\nCategories\n\nData Report\n\nLeveling Up\n\nFrom conversation to connection: how brands can turn Likes into action\n\nCategories\n\nSocial Media Engagement\n\nSocial Media Strategy\n\n9 stats social media marketers need to show their bosses ASAP\n\nPublished on May 7, 2019 • Reading time 8 minutes",
      "# [24 Facebook statistics marketers should know in 2024 by Chloe West on 2024-03-19](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/facebook-stats-for-marketers/)\nKnow whether your target audience is still on Facebook? Or if you should keep investing in Facebook ads? Staying on top of the latest Facebook statistics will give you the insights you need to update your Facebook marketing strategy.\n\nEven after all this time, Facebook continues to be the most popular social media platform with the largest user base across all platforms. Understanding statistics around its usage, demographics, marketing uses and more can help inform your marketing strategy.\n\nSo without further ado, let’s dig in.\n\nTop 3 Facebook stats every marketer should know\n\nFacebook usage statistics\n\nFacebook user statistics\n\nFacebook audience and demographics statistics\n\nFacebook advertising and marketing statistics\n\nFacebook engagement statistics\n\nFacebook video statistics\n\nFacebook feature stats (Reels, Stories, Messenger)\n\nFacebook consumer behavior statistics\n\nTop 3 Facebook stats every marketer should know\n\nFacebook is the third most visited website following Google and YouTube, respectively. This puts it ahead of other leading platforms like Twitter and Instagram.\n\nThe platform boasts 3.065 billion active users on a monthly basis. This makes it the most used social media platform worldwide.\n\nIn 2023, Facebook’s total ad revenue amounted to $135 billion, up from $116 billion the previous year.\n\nFacebook usage statistics\n\nOver the years, Facebook has become almost synonymous with social media. It continues to be the biggest social media platform and is widely popular on a global scale. Here are some of the key Facebook usage statistics to understand its popularity and inform your Facebook marketing strategy:\n\n1. Facebook hit 3 billion monthly active users in 2023\n\nBy Q4 of 2023, monthly active users on the platform had grown to 3.065 billion after reaching the 3 billion user milestone in Q2 of 2023. Although adoption has slowed down, monthly usage is still seeing an upward trend. If your marketing efforts are also feeling stagnant, download our Facebook marketing template to reinvigorate your strategy.\n\n2. Americans spend about 30.9 minutes on the platform daily\n\nOn average, American users spend about 30.9 minutes on Facebook daily. This puts it ahead of other leading platforms such as X, Instagram and even TikTok. These numbers suggest that the platform is still seeing a high level of engagement from its user base.\n\nFacebook user statistics\n\nFacebook may have billions of users, but how are these people using the platform? Let’s look at a few vital Facebook user statistics to find out:\n\n3. Over two-third of all monthly users are active daily\n\nOut of the 3.065 billion monthly active users, 2.1 billion people use the platform daily. That’s 68.6% of users who spend at least some amount of time daily on the platform.\n\nIn other words, there are billions of people your brand could potentially reach every single day. The key is to get ahead of the Facebook algorithm so you can get more organic visibility.\n\n4. Facebook is the most popular site for people to get their news\n\nOut of U.S. adults who regularly look to social media for their news, 30% of them head to Facebook. This is ahead of YouTube (26%), Instagram (16%), TikTok (14%) and X (12%).\n\n5. Messaging friends and family is still the top activity on Facebook\n\nOver 72% of users say they use Facebook to message friends and family. This suggests that the platform’s “social” factor is still alive and kicking. Other popular activities on the platform are posting/sharing photos and videos (63.5%) and keeping up to date with news and events (58.7%).\n\nA significant number of users (54.3%) follow and research brands and products on Facebook. So although it’s mostly for social, your brand can still use the platform to build authentic connections.\n\n6. 59% of Facebook users have reached out to a brand on the platform\n\nSocial media is also commonly used for customer support requests. One survey found that 59% of Facebook users have reached out to a brand on the platform. Forty-six percent of those messages have been specifically in regards to customer care issues.\n\nEven though Facebook is a social network, it can still be a great outlet for providing customer support and improving experiences with your brand. In fact, 76% of consumers notice and appreciate when companies prioritize customer support, regardless of network.\n\nFacebook audience and demographics statistics\n\nWondering if you’re reaching the right audience on Facebook? What if your target demographic isn’t even on the platform? Here are a few Facebook stats highlighting the platform’s audience and demographics:\n\n7. Users ages 25-34 years represent Facebook’s largest audience\n\nDespite the platform’s reputation as a seemingly “older” network, 24.4% of Facebook users in the United States are between the ages of 25 and 34. Moreover, the platform sees higher usage among people below the age of 44.\n\n8. Usage among teens has dropped sharply\n\nThat said, the platform’s popularity among teens has seen a significant drop. Only 33% of teens were using Facebook as of 2023. This is a sharp decline compared to the 71% who were using the platform between 2014 and 2015.\n\n9. Facebook has more male-identifying users than female\n\nFacebook currently limits its reporting to male and female. And based on the data, the platform has a higher percentage of male users (56.3%) than female users (43.7%).\n\n10. India has the largest Facebook audience size\n\nWhile Facebook sees significant usage across various countries, India has the greatest number of users. Latest reports show that there are 314.6 million Facebook users in India. The United States comes next, with 175 million users.\n\nFacebook advertising and marketing statistics\n\nIs Facebook marketing still worth it? And are you getting the most out of your Facebook advertising strategy? Check out these Facebook ads statistics to understand advertising impact on the platform.\n\n11. Facebook ads see an average click-through rate (CTR) of 2.50%\n\nAccording to a WordStream study, Facebook ads get an average CTR of 2.50% across all industries for lead gen ads. That said, click-throughs vary for industries, with arts & entertainment, physicians & surgeons, real estate and sports & recreation sectors seeing a CTR of at least 3% and the travel industry hitting a CTR of over 6%.\n\nFacebook traffic ads and campaigns see a lower CTR, with the average rate being 1.51% across all industries. Arts & entertainment, real estate, restaurants & food and travel all see a CTR above 2%.\n\n12. Advertising for traffic campaigns on Facebook costs $0.83 per click\n\nThe same study found that the average cost per click (CPC) is $0.83 across all industries for traffic ads and $1.92 for lead gen ads. However, you can expect to pay much more in certain industries or campaign ads. For example, lead gen ads have a CPC of over $5 for attorneys and nearly $4 for dentists and physicians.\n\n13. The average conversion rate is 8.25% across industries\n\nFacebook sees a fairly high conversion rate for ads on the platform. On average, you can expect a conversion rate of about 8.25% for your Facebook ad. However, the specifics may vary depending on your industry. Arts & entertainment, dental services, industrial & commercial and real estate sectors see a significantly higher conversion rate.\n\n14. Facebook generates the highest ROI\n\nNeedless to say, with such high conversion rates and low CPC, marketing on Facebook yields high returns. In fact, Facebook generates the highest return on investment among all other social media platforms, tied only with Instagram at 29%.\n\nFacebook engagement statistics\n\nWith organic visibility on Facebook on the decline, it’s only natural to see a drop in engagement levels as well. But does this put Facebook at a disadvantage over other social media platforms? Here’s a quick look at some vital stats to understand where Facebook engagement:\n\n15. The median engagement rate on Facebook is 0.063%\n\nAccording to a RivalIQ study, brands see a median Facebook engagement rate of 0.063% across all industries. This puts Facebook as one of the less engaging social media platforms, beating only X/Twitter’s 0.029% engagement rate.\n\n16. Photo posts and status posts have the highest engagement\n\nThe power of visuals is still evident on Facebook, with photo posts getting the highest engagement at 0.10%. Video posts come next with an average engagement rate of 0.08%. Status posts perform fairly well with an average engagement rate of 0.06%. Link posts, on the other hand, are the worst for driving engagement. They see an average engagement rate of only 0.03%.\n\n17. Frequent posting doesn’t result in higher engagement\n\nContrary to popular belief, posting frequently doesn’t necessarily result in higher engagement. As the RivalIQ study points out, influencers and higher education industry see the greatest engagement compared to their posting frequency.\n\nInfluencers and higher education pages publish fewer than 10 posts per week. Meanwhile, media companies publish over 60 posts a week and only see an average engagement rate of 0.04%.\n\nRather than post frequency, post publishing should be a factor in your strategy. Know the best time to post on Facebook so you stand a better chance of driving engagement.\n\nFacebook video statistics\n\nAs video marketing continues to gain popularity, it’s important to be aware of how video performs on Facebook. Here are some key Facebook video statistics to inform your strategy:\n\n18. 50% of the time users spend on Facebook is spent watching videos\n\nAccording to Facebook’s own data, about half the time spent on Facebook (and Instagram) is watching video content. This means your audience likely watches video content on the app, and creating more video can help you reach more people. We’re created a quick guide on creating a successful social media video strategy, if you need a refresher.\n\n19. Vertical video with audio sees a 35% higher click-through rate\n\nFacebook Reels have been popular on the app since they were created and integrated into the app from Instagram. Facebook discovered that vertical video (Reels) with audio see a 35% higher CTR than other types of video content on the platform.\n\nFacebook feature stats (Reels, Stories, Messenger)\n\nSo, what sort of content should you post? What features are growing and what’s stagnant? Let’s review some Facebook stats that break down some of the platform’s key features, like Facebook Stories, Reels and Messenger:\n\n20. More than 500 million people use Stories every day\n\nAccording to internal Facebook data, half a billion people use Facebook Stories each day and more than 1 billion Stories shared every day across the Meta apps. This speaks to the popularity of the platform’s feature, making it a useful tool for brands to engage their audience.\n\n21. Facebook Messenger has nearly 1 billion users\n\nMeanwhile, there are nearly 1 billion people using Facebook Messenger. That’s almost a billion people you could potentially reach through ads on Messenger.\n\n22. Reels hit 200 billion views per day across Facebook apps\n\nThe popularity of Reels isn’t dying out anytime soon. In fact, Reels see about 200 billion views on a daily basis across the Facebook family of apps.\n\nWith algorithms further pushing this format, Reels could help you gain visibility and engagement. In short, brands can’t afford to put this short-form video format on the back burner.\n\nFacebook consumer behavior statistics\n\nFinally, are people even shopping on Facebook? Here are some stats on how consumers are behaving on the platform:\n\n23. Facebook has the highest number of social commerce buyers\n\nAccording to eMarketer, US adults were more likely to make a purchase directly on Facebook in Q1 2023.

      "# [10 social media trends you need to know in 2025 by Jamia Kenan on 2025-01-14](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-trends/)\nData is the best fortune teller.\n\nCombining performance and consumer preference data paints a vivid picture of the future of social media trends—one that’s so bright we need sunglasses. Data shows you what’s driving audience behavior and where your brand fits in the mix.\n\nThat’s why for the 20th edition of The Sprout Social Index™, we surveyed over 4,000 consumers, 900 social practitioners and 300 marketing leaders across the US, UK, Canada and Australia. We also formed the Index Council, a cohort of experts and thought leaders who helped us interpret the data and shared their advice for social marketers.\n\nLearn about the top 10 social media trends driving our industry’s future, based on data from the report and the Index Council.\n\nDownload The Sprout Social Index™\n\nTrend 1: Video is still king\n\nOf course, video is the first social media trend on our list. TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts and other emerging video formats on LinkedIn and Threads have created feature parity, making video content a priority across networks. And although TikTok’s future in the US is uncertain, it’ll remain a mainstay in international markets.\n\nWe already know short-form video is one of the best ways to connect with your audience and reach new followers. But long-form video is resurging. TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn and YouTube have all offered longer lengths over the past few years. For example, as of October 2024, YouTub Shorts can now be up to three minutes long. And, The 2025 Index found that YouTube is one of the top three platforms where people have social media profiles.\n\nInstagram Reels range from 15 to 90 seconds. TikTok videos are three seconds to 10 minutes long.\n\nFor instance, Cheekbone Beauty uses video content across their social profiles. The makeup brand repurposes video content, but they also create videos tailored to the platform. For example, their LinkedIn focuses on highlighting media placements, brand storytelling and messages from their founder Jenn Harper.\n\nThey use YouTube, TikTok and Instagram for short-form videos, but they incorporate videos longer than a minute as well.\n\nBrand takeaway: Since video is available almost everywhere, consider investing more in video where it makes sense for your brand and audience. While video may require a bigger investment, you can get the most out of your budget by repurposing, adapting and cross-posting video content across networks. For instance, if you have a podcast on YouTube, consider promoting your longer form videos with short-form videos on Threads, Reels or TikTok. Make sure to cater to each platform’s unique audience, culture and characteristics.\n\nTrend 2: Cultural fluency is must for brands\n\nSocial media is the epicenter of culture. Today’s consumers are flocking to screens to learn about the latest happenings—gone are the days of traditional media. The Index found consumers definitively agree: Across generations, 90% of consumers use social media to keep up with trends and cultural moments, even more than TV and streaming services, talking to friends and family and other digital media.\n\nOnline culture is layered, complex, niche and ever-changing, so being culturally competent is a must for brands. Some 93% consumers agree it’s important for brands to keep up with online culture. And nearly all (98%) of social media practitioners agree that social content has to keep up with online trends and culture.\n\nWant a masterclass in understanding online culture? Take a deep look into Marc Jacobs’ TikTok. The fashion house references niche trends, memes and communities on the platform, often working with celebrities, creators and influencers who embody the brand.\n\nAnd you’ll often see the comments section giving the brand praise for truly understanding internet culture. For example, viewers applauded Marc Jacobs when the brand featured Khadi Rhad, a creator-influencer known for his dark, edgy aesthetics and eclectic dances.\n\nHowever, consumers are split on whether it’s embarrassing for brands to participate in trends. And more than a quarter say jumping on viral social media trends is only effective one or two days after the trend emerges. But this expectation is nearly impossible to meet for social teams with long approval processes.\n\nBrand takeaway: Aim to be fluent in the online zeitgeist, but understand there’s a fine line between culture and trends. Trends are just one aspect of online culture. Understand the viral images and videos, celebrity memes, rising influencers and emerging content formats, but avoid participating in every trend. Be intentional and selective with the trends your brand participates in. Consider how it’s relevant to your audience and how you’ll add your own spin. Don’t try to be like everyone else—your brand should be the trendsetter who sets waves and begins conversations.\n\nTrend 3: Strong brand storytelling and engagement are audience must-haves\n\nSocial media saturation forces marketers to find ways to stand out from the crowd so they can resonate with target audiences. Creating original content is one way brands are differentiating themselves from others on the timeline. When consumers rank the most and least important traits of brand content, they rank authenticity, relatability and entertainment first. On the other hand, polished, product-centric and off-the-cuff are ranked as the least important.\n\nConsumers are flocking to brands who know their identity and embrace it. Some 49% of consumers say the originality of content makes their favorite brands stand out on social. Consumers are also paying attention to how brands interact—36% say how they engage with their followers makes brands stand out.\n\nA member of the Arboretum, Sprout’s community for social media professionals, said their company is seeing a shift to raw, first-person content outperforming more curated content, showing how authenticity continues to win.\n\nBrand takeaway: Think about how you can use social media to support your unique brand story and voice. Be intentional with your content and how you interact with your audience and followers. Growing and retaining audiences means being authentic to your brand and marketing your product in a way that goes beyond the limits of “salesy, corporate” jargon.\n\nTrend 4: The creator economy grows\n\nThis social media trend is unsurprising. Creators and influencers are integral to the ecosystem of social media and marketing. The creator economy will continue to evolve as there is a diverse array of creators and influencers that can address various niches and industries. Brands aren’t solely looking to people with massive followings because there’s value in working with smaller creators and influencers. For example, user-generated content creators—who don’t need large followings or recognizable personal brands—will remain important contributors for brands seeking content that looks and feels organic.\n\nMeanwhile, B2B creators are rising on LinkedIn, using the platform to share industry insights, thought leadership and valuable content that helps businesses build professional networks and drive growth. For example, LG, also known as the Brandfluencer, gives advice to influencers, user-generated content creators and brands on LinkedIn. In the sponsored post below, he shares an inspirational quote he’s been thinking about during the new year and uses it set the stage to encourage people to learn about National University’s Year of You scholarship and other programs.\n\nBrand takeaway: The creator economy shaping the future of social media. Consider the versatility of the creator economy and think about how your brand can take advantage of it. Take your collaborations a step further and work with creators and influencers beyond content creation—how can you create long-term partnerships? How can creators and influencers help you improve your product and services?\n\nTrend 5: Artificial intelligence (AI) is a solution to creative burnout\n\nMarketing departments across all industries and sectors have invested in using AI to help them become more efficient. In the year ahead, AI’s influence will continue to grow. Half of marketing leaders say they’ll spend 2025 maximizing the AI tools they’ve already purchased and 48% want to invest in more.\n\nSocial practitioners are using AI tools to automate timely tasks and reporting, streamline workflows and most notably, brainstorm new ideas. Social marketers must maintain a steady stream of content. But when you’re constantly producing for multiple audiences and networks, creative burnout becomes a risk.\n\nAlmost half of social practitioners report the same amount of creative fatigue as a year ago, while over one-third feel even more. However, on the bright side, 93% of social practitioners believe AI is a tool that can help reduce creative fatigue if used correctly. And it’s worth noting that AI can also help with creative execution. For example, Andy Orsow, video marketer at Framer, used AI to place a flag on a Salesforce tower in San Francisco.\n\nBrand takeaway: Continue learning and experimenting with AI tools and use cases. Understand AI should never be used verbatim to create content or replace the work of a human. Think of AI as a sparring partner to help you be more efficient or remove writer’s block so you can ideate something new. For example, you might share a prompt to help get your creative juices flowing, but once you’re warmed up, you can refine and tailor according to your brand guidelines. It’s also an efficiency tool you can use to remove the mental bandwidth and manual effort of performing intensive, time consuming tasks like data analysis. We’ve put together a list of real-world examples of AI in social media to inspire your teams of where to streamline efforts.\n\nTrend 6: Social search is a top priority\n\nNetworks like YouTube and TikTok have asserted themselves as major search engines, emphasizing the importance of optimizing for social media search. Consumers are flocking to the search bar to find answers, but they’re also using features like Instagram and TikTok’s searchable map features. And as more networks introduce AI-driven search features, discovery is continuing to evolve.\n\nSimilar to Google’s AI Overview, AI social search results provide content summaries to give direct, scannable answers to user queries. The next generation of marketers are using social engine optimization and learning how to master artificial intelligence optimization (AIO).\n\nBrand takeaway: The next generation of marketers are using social engine optimization and learning how to master artificial intelligence optimization (AIO). Consider how you can optimize your content for social search across networks and pay attention to how SEOs approach AIO so you can incorporate rising tactics into your own strategy where appropriate.\n\nTrend 7: Niche communities go IRL\n\nWe’ve talked about how social media is a hub for culture, but it’s also the foundation for subcultures to thrive as well. Niche communities will continue to grow in 2025 in many ways. For one, brands, creators and influencers alike are leaning into private communities and subscription-based models to share exclusive content and connection opportunities. Think Instagram subscriptions and broadcast channels, invite-only LinkedIn groups and social networks, like Lapse, that focus on friendship over followers.\n\nWe’ll also see niche communities extend past the screen, as Tameka Bazile, Social and Content Strategist, mentioned in Sprout’s 2024’s Top Trends: Your 2025 Strategy webinar, “Brands and creators are taking to real live events that are extensions of the communities they create online…these communities are steeped in culture.”\n\nOne great example of this is 222, which provides curated experiences in real life.\n\nBrand takeaway: Consumers are looking for their community online. Consider how your social team can invest in specialized trends or niche interests that align with your audience to create meaningful brand activations. Pay attention to subcultures across networks and consider what creators and influencers you can collaborate with to foster community engagement.\n\nTrend 8: Quality in product, commerce and customer care trumps all\n\nThere’s only one thing that surpasses original content and engagement: quality product and services. Some 63% of consumers say their favorite brands on social media have quality products or services.\n\nEven the most creative social posts can’t compensate for a poor quality product or customer experience. From native search bars to direct messages and user-generated content, social media innately encompasses so much of the customer journey.\n\nThe buyer journey exists on social media and goes beyond posts, carousels and short-form videos—brands are shaping holistic customer experiences. In the year ahead, social will have an even larger impact in commerce and customer care. Customer care teams are familiar with high-volume inboxes and dealing with social inquiries across networks. Responding quickly is a must as 73% of social users agree if a brand doesn’t respond on social, they’ll buy from a competitor.\n\nNearly three-quarters of consumers expect a response within 24 hours or sooner. This is consistent with Index reporting in 2022 and 2023, too. Users are doubling down on their customer care standards and they’re seeking premier experiences on social media. Consumers say companies should make personalized customer service their #1 social media priority in 2025.\n\nBrand takeaway: Don’t leave your customers on read. Aim to address their customer service concerns promptly. Share the insights you learn on social media with your research and development teams to improve your products and services. Engage with your audience and listen to their feedback to shape holistic customer experiences.\n\nTrend 9: Emerging networks offer opportunities to experiment\n\nLongstanding social networks are changing. Newer platforms are evolving, creating their own communities and cultures while attracting diverse user bases. These emerging networks are becoming testing grounds for innovative content and engagement strategies, allowing creators and brands to experiment with fresh ideas. Threads, for instance, is gaining traction with its focus on short, threaded conversations, providing a more nuanced and interactive experience. As more social media networks emerge, brands will have to be more intentional about where they spend their time.\n\nBrand takeaway: Give newer platforms time to develop. You don’t have to immediately dive into creating content on a new platform for the sake of it. If you want to try new networks, give yourself time to learn and experiment.\n\nTrend 10: Social data remains key\n\nOur last social media trend on our list is one of the most important: marketers will be more data-driven than ever. Proving the value of social media is a common challenge for marketers, and leading with data can show the impact behind their efforts to secure more buy-in and resources. The Sprout Social Index™ found 65% of marketing leaders say demonstrating how social media campaigns are tied to business goals is crucial for securing social investment, followed by quantifying cost savings using social (52%). Sharing social data via dashboards or data visualizations are two other priorities.\n\nSocial teams will evolve how they measure success. Although overall engagement will remain important, social teams will also consider other factors such as production efficiency and the volume of positive feedback from leadership. Measuring the number of teams using social data to inform their work or share content is also important.\n\nBrand takeaway: Use robust data storytelling to demonstrate the ROI of social media efforts. Consider how you can use AI to help automate data visualization to help contextualize impact in a digestible way. Think about how you may need to evolve your success metrics to accurately measure your social campaigns. Adopting comprehensive measurement strategies can help you better justify social investments and drive strategic growth.\n\nLearn more about social media trends in 2025",
      "# [Social media marketing: What it is and how to build your strategy by Jamia Kenan on 2024-08-22](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-marketing-strategy/)\nLooking to fine-tune your social media marketing strategy? Now’s the perfect time to make it happen. In a landscape with more competition, content and networks than ever, a succinct strategy gives you the focus needed to say “no” to efforts that don’t serve your goals.\n\nThat’s why we put together a comprehensive guide to creating a social media marketing plan from scratch. Whether you’re totally new to social or want to double-check your priorities in 2024, this guide has you covered.\n\nWhat is social media marketing?\n\nSocial media marketing means using social media platforms like Instagram, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Facebook to promote your brand and sell your product or service.\n\nIf your business comes out with a new item and you plan to promote the launch on social media, that’s social media marketing. If you interact with your customers via comments, that’s social media marketing. And if you create engaging content that showcases your brand’s values and story, that’s social media marketing too.\n\nThis form of marketing requires you to use social media management skills and tools. Just as you prepare other aspects of your marketing strategy, you need to have a plan for your social media marketing.\n\nWhat is a social media marketing strategy?\n\nA social media marketing strategy is a comprehensive plan that integrates your social media efforts with your team’s goals and the broader business objectives. This alignment ensures that your activities are not only optimized for performance but also deliver measurable results that contribute to your overall marketing success.\n\nA well-defined social media marketing strategy also sets clear boundaries around your team’s time and expertise. Social media is a unique channel, and while nearly everyone uses it, this widespread usage often leads people to overestimate their expertise.\n\nEvery social media manager has faced requests to share content that isn’t formatted correctly or doesn’t align with the overarching campaign. Having a robust social media marketing strategy empowers you to confidently say “no” when necessary, ensuring that your efforts remain focused and effective.\n\nWhat are the benefits of a social media strategy?\n\nThis question can feel like a bit of a no-brainer to marketers that live and breathe social. That said, being able to clearly articulate the advantages of a cohesive social media strategy is crucial for securing buy-in from other stakeholders. Here’s how a well-defined social media strategy benefits your brand and business:\n\nIt increases brand awareness and engagement\n\nAccording to The Sprout Social Index™, 90% of consumers use social media to keep up with trends and cultural moments. Amid a fractured cultural landscape, social media has emerged to fill a seemingly endless need for content.\n\nWhen brands commit to a cohesive social media marketing strategy, they develop the consistency needed to form a brand identity that cuts through the noise to resonate with a target audience. Case in point: Figo Pet Insurance.\n\nIn 2022, the Figo team committed to sharing four to five TikTok videos per week. Over time, they were able to pinpoint what messages appeal to their audience. These efforts led to audience growth and multiple viral videos.\n\nAs you refine your strategy over time, you too can craft more precise messaging that not only attracts more fans but also drives greater engagement.\n\nIt promotes brand trust\n\nSocial’s impact on brand trust is palpable, particularly for younger consumers.\n\nAccording to a Q2 2024 Sprout Pulse Survey, 78% of consumers surveyed strongly/somewhat agree that—compared to a year ago—a brand’s social media presence has a larger impact on whether or not they trust that brand. That number goes up to 88% for Gen Z. What influences that trust the most? The content you post on social.\n\nIn the 2010s, a poorly designed website might deter consumers due to concerns about fraud. Today, the same principle applies to social media. If consumers get to your profiles and see irregular updates, inconsistent messaging or content that doesn’t align with where it’s been posted, it’s going to raise red flags and undermine trust.\n\nIt supports performance measurement\n\nYour social media marketing strategy creates the infrastructure needed to prove the ROI of your efforts. Without one, you may be able to report on social media KPIs, but it'll be much harder to showcase how they align with strategic objectives.\n\nFor example, say you work with an automotive brand and one of your top business objectives is to increase market share with parents of young children. With that in mind, you can develop a strategic content pillar around this specific audience, and report on the performance of those posts over time.\n\nWith a social listening tool, you can even measure how your brand’’s share of voice stacks up against key competitors. This is a highly effective way to gauge your brand’s visibility and market share within your industry.\n\nLearn more about social listening tools\n\nIt drives revenue\n\nOur Q2 2024 Pulse Survey also found that social media is the top channel for product discovery, with 81% of consumers surveyed using the channel to shop around for their next purchase.\n\nAs social commerce adoption continues to skyrocket in the US and abroad, social media now supports a full-funnel experience. Even B2B brands are using social media to enhance lead generation and drive pipeline growth.\n\nFor example, when Simpli.fi, an advertising success platform, integrated employee advocacy into their social media strategy, the company realized $90,000 in earned media value in three months.\n\nHow to create a social media marketing strategy\n\nNow that we’ve defined social media marketing and its benefits, let’s walk through how to create a plan.\n\nHere’s our six-step process for developing a social media marketing strategy that drives results.\n\nStep 1: Set goals and establish KPIs\n\nSocial media strategy planning starts with your goals. Whether you want to expand your team, build a larger following or a more active community, taking the time to define your social goals is the first step to reaching them.\n\nThe goals you set will inform the key performance indicators (KPIs) you track, and how much time and energy you’ll need to dedicate to your campaigns.\n\nExample social media goals for 2024 and beyond\n\nWhat really matters is that you set realistic social media goals. We recommend tackling smaller objectives that allow you to scale your social efforts in a way that’s both reasonable and affordable.\n\nBelow are some example social media marketing goals that businesses of all shapes and sizes can pursue.\n\nGoal example 1: Increase brand awareness\n\nBrand awareness means getting your name out there. According to the Index, 93% of consumers agree it's important for brands to keep up with online culture.\n\nTry to avoid solely publishing promotional messages and strike a good balance with authentic content that emphasizes your brand’s voice and story. The Index further found consumers favor brands that post original content and interact regularly with their audience.\n\nFor example, in this TikTok video, Sani, a family-owned apparel company features a day in the life of the brand’s founders while visiting India for business.\n\nIf you want to increase brand awareness, here are the social media metrics you’ll want to focus on:\n\nReach: Post reach is the number of unique users who saw your post. How much of your content actually reaches users’ feeds?\n\nImpressions: At the post level, impressions are how many times a post is displayed to someone. Impressions are a good indicator of how popular a piece of content is, and that people may be viewing a post multiple times.\n\nHashtag performance: What were your most-used hashtags? Which hashtags were most associated with your brand? Having these answers can help shape the focus of your content going forward.\n\nVideo views: This may come off as a vanity metric. But on certain channels, like TikTok, views count as impressions, and are therefore important to monitor.\n\nGoal example 2: Generate leads and sales\n\nWhether online, in-store or directly through your social profiles, followers don’t make purchases by accident. For example, are you alerting customers about new products and promos? Are you integrating your product catalog into your social profiles? Are you running exclusive deals for followers? Social media gives you an avenue to generate revenue.\n\nHere are the metrics you’ll want to track if you’re focused on lead generation and sales:\n\nConversions: A conversion is when someone takes a desired action, like purchasing something from your site or signing up for an upcoming event.\n\nConversion rate: Conversion rate measures how well your social ad or campaign is convincing people to take a desired action.\n\nGoal example 3: Grow your brand’s audience\n\nBringing new followers into the fold means finding ways to introduce your brand to folks who haven’t heard of you before. Growing your audience also means discovering conversations around your business and industry that matter the most.\n\nDigging through your social channels is nearly impossible without monitoring or listening for specific keywords, phrases or hashtags. Having a pulse on these conversations helps you expand your core audience (and reach adjacent audiences) much faster.\n\nImportant audience growth metrics include:\n\nFollower growth: Your follower growth measures the net new followers you gained in a specific time period.\n\nFollower growth rate: The percentage that shows you how quickly your audience is actually growing—or slowing—within a certain time period.\n\nGoal example 4: Provide holistic customer care\n\nThe Index shows most consumers believe the most memorable thing a brand can do on social media is respond to customers.\n\nThis means companies need to experiment with messaging and content when approaching customer care. For example, does your team have a protocol for handling @-mentions and comments? Do you have templated responses to FAQs? Does your brand promote user-generated content and hashtags? Your customers can be your best cheerleaders, but only if you give them a reason to grab the megaphone.\n\nIf you want to improve your business’ approach to social customer care, here are the customer service metrics you need to track:\n\nAverage first reply time: The time it takes for your team to send out the first reply to an inbound customer message within business hours.\n\nReply or response rate: The rate that brands respond to messages or comments that they receive on a daily basis.\n\nResolution rate: The percentage of customer inquiries that are fully resolved. This metric can reveal how equipped your entire company is to address customer inquiries.\n\nGoal example 5: Drive traffic to your site to illustrate ROI of social efforts\n\nThe Index shows that marketing leaders plan to measure social media success with overall engagement, audience growth, social interactions, web visitors and share of voice.\n\nSimple enough. If you’re laser-focused on generating leads or traffic to your website, social media can make it happen. Whether through organic promotional posts or social ads, keeping an eye on the following metrics can help you better determine your ROI from social media:\n\nWebsite traffic: Monitoring website traffic can help you properly attribute increases to specific campaigns or viral posts.\n\nSocial media referral traffic: This describes people who visit your website directly from social media pages and posts.\n\nAny combination of these goals is fair game and can help you better understand which networks to tackle, too. When in doubt, keep your social media marketing strategy simple rather than complicating it with too many objectives that might distract you. Pick one or two and rally your team around them.\n\nBonus resource: A great deck can bridge the gap between raw social data and direct business value. Use this presentation template to pitch a compelling vision for your next campaign, initiative or annual strategy\n\nGet the deck template\n\nStep 2: Research your target audience and select your networks\n\nMaking assumptions is bad news for marketers. Both leaders and practitioners can disprove assumptions from the valuable insights social data provides. With the right tool, marketers can quickly research their audience. No formal market research or data science chops necessary.\n\nWhat you need to know about your audience to influence your social media marketing strategy is already available. You just have to know where to look.\n\nRemember: different platforms attract different audiences. Social media demographics and benchmark statistics are great for understanding where your target audience lives, but it's also important to understand the nuances of each social network so you can decide where your business needs to be.\n\nFor the sake of narrowing down where you should spend your time, below is a quick overview of each of the major social platforms:\n\nX\n\nSimple and straightforward, X is a solid starting point for most businesses. Requiring minimal setup and providing a place to go back and forth with followers directly, there's a reason why X remains one of the go-to platforms for customer service. If you’re trying to master the social media marketing basics of hashtags, tagging, brand voice and social media etiquette, look no further.\n\nFacebook\n\nFacebook is a must-have for brick-and-mortar businesses looking to target local customers. Allowing check-ins and reviews, it’s a prime place to grow a dedicated local following. Plus, they have an incredible chatbot functionality that can take your customer service strategy and marketing campaigns to the next level.\n\nLike many social algorithm changes, the platform’s algorithm change in late 2022 posed a challenge to some businesses looking to grow their Pages and stay in touch with fans consistently. The earliest algorithm prioritized Likes, but today’s is much more sophisticated and focuses on showing users the most relevant, meaningful content based on inventory, signals, relevancy scoring and other factors. That said, Facebook’s ad platform is the gold standard for social media ads because it can help businesses cut through the noise and lessen the impact of algorithm changes.\n\nInstagram\n\nAt its core, Instagram is a network centered around visual content. A major hub for brick-and-mortar businesses, e-commerce shops and influencers alike, the platform encourages brands to get creative. From eye-popping photos to clever captions, it’s all about finding unique ways to show off what you’re selling.\n\nThreads\n\nWhen Meta released Threads on July 5, 2023, the social network received over 100 million registrations less than a week after its launch, making it the most rapidly downloaded app ever. The launch of Threads sparked conversations about its role in the fediverse, or decentralized social media.\n\nBut, for now, Threads is a text-based social network that users can sign up for through their current Instagram account. Users can post on mobile, but Threads is also available on desktop. Threads are great for brands who already have Instagram accounts because the sign-up process is pretty seamless.\n\nLinkedIn\n\nLinkedIn is a network laser-focused on business trends and networking. LinkedIn is a goldmine, especially for anyone networking in the B2B space. Looking to get in touch with an influencer, marketing manager or CEO? Chances are you can find them here.\n\nThere are so many benefits of using LinkedIn marketing beyond networking, including content distribution and lead generation. We also have a guide for LinkedIn best practices so you can get full advantage of those benefits.\n\nPinterest\n\nPinterest marketing is insanely popular, especially among Gen Z and Millennials. Over 465 million people use this visual pinning platform every month to find inspiration and their next purchase. Pinterest is noted to be one of the best networks for social selling. Like Instagram, Pinterest thrives on imagery and inspirational content where products serve as the proverbial centerpiece.\n\nTikTok\n\nTikTok reached 1 billion users in September 2021 and remains one of the most popular apps in the world. Along with its viral trends and niche communities, the short-form video app is known for its hyper-personalized algorithm that keeps users scrolling for hours. TikTok marketing has changed the game for brands, allowing them to connect with customers in an entirely new way.\n\nYouTube\n\nAlthough some might not regard YouTube as a traditional social network, the platform’s active and engaged community speaks for itself. Considering that video represents the top-performing type of content across nearly every social network, YouTube is a great place to house your videos if you’re already producing them.\n\nPicking networks for your social media marketing strategy\n\nThere are more than 15 social media platforms your brand can use, but don’t spread yourself too thin. Rather than try to dominate them all, you should consider which platforms make the most sense based on your industry and target audience.\n\nDo your homework on your existing social media audience and focus on networks where your core audience is already active. You need to do further analysis before you can determine what your real-world social customers actually look like.\n\nThat’s why many brands use a social media marketing dashboard that provides an overview of who’s following you and how they interact with you on each channel.\n\nFor example, Sprout’s analytics dashboard puts your audience demographics front and center. It highlights which social networks see the most activity, helping you ensure you spend your time on the right network.\n\nYou can also use analytics to determine if you should create a new social media account. With Sprout, you can view X, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube and Pinterest data side-by-side in a customizable format that’s exportable by date range and profile.\n\nThere are plenty of other sources of valuable audience data to supplement your social media insights. This includes your Google and email analytics, your CRM, your customer service platform or even your best-selling products.\n\nAll of the above will ultimately influence everything from your marketing messaging to how you’ll approach customer service or social commerce.\n\nStep 3: Create (and curate) timely & engaging social content\n\nNo surprises here. Your social media marketing strategy hinges on your content. At this point, you should have a pretty good idea of what to publish based on your goals, audience and brand identity. You probably feel confident in which networks to cover, too.\n\nBut what about your content strategy? Below are some tips, ideas and inspiration that can help.\n\nDefining your content strategy\n\nComing up with a content strategy might seem like a lot of legwork, but it all really boils down to your goals.\n\nLooking to educate your audience in the B2B space? Publish blogs, news and opinions relevant to your industry.\n\nTrying to push e-commerce products? Post action shots of your products and photos of others showing off your swag.\n\nFocused on customer service? Tips, shout-outs and company updates are fair game.\n\nRegardless of what you might post, coming up with a hashtag to couple with your content is a brilliant branding move.\n\nHashtags can be used to get your attention and encourage people to share their photos interacting with your brand.\n\nFind your brand voice\n\nOne of the best ways to stand out on social media is to define your distinct brand voice. Chances are you’ve seen a post from a particular brand that just feels like, well, theirs.\n\nThe quippy, casual tone that makes Discord’s X presence beloved by casual users and moderators alike is a great example.\n\nOf course, not every company will benefit from the same sort of tone. The key is to present yourself as a human rather than a robot. Adopt a consistent brand voice and style that’s appropriate for your business.\n\nBake timeliness into your strategy\n\nTimeliness is arguably more important than ever for marketers. Not only are you expected to put out fresh content regularly, but also to always be “on” for your followers. But you can’t always expect customers to operate on your clock. And timeliness is a tall order when you’re strapped for resources or are part of a small team.\n\nAs evidenced by our best times to post on social, brands have a lot of ground to cover in terms of frequency and how much content to push. It’s important to pay attention to the optimal times for engagement so you can automate the most tedious aspects of your social presence without having to worry about posting in real time.\n\nBut, quick question: When is your brand available to engage and interact with customers?\n\nYou might see some recommended times to post late in the evening, for example. But if your team isn’t there to communicate, what’s the point of posting at the “preferred” time?\n\nWhen you’re able to do so, ensure your social media or community managers are available and ready to answer any product questions or concerns when you post. Take time to review the best times to post on social media, but remember that it’s just as critical to engage after posting\n\nYou should also consider taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and automation so you can serve and engage with customers when your team is offline, which leads us to our next point.\n\nTake advantage of short-form video\n\nThanks to the rise of TikTok and Instagram Reels, social video is booming. Short-form productions continue to dominate the social space across all platforms due to their high engagement rate.\n\nThe 2022 Sprout Social Index™ data shows that consumers find short-form videos 2.5x more engaging than long-form ones. Some 66% of consumers report paying the most attention to short-form content as well.\n\nThanks to advancements in DIY and remote video production, you don’t need massive budgets to be successful. All you need is a laptop or smartphone and a few tricks of the trade, like video length best practices and editing tools.\n\nShare posts that show off your brand’s uniqueness and human side\n\nBoth personal and personable content should be a cornerstone of your social media marketing strategy. Don’t be afraid to remind followers of the humans behind your posts. Remember that over a third of consumers are looking for authentic, original content from brands.\n\nFor example, Zoom has excellent original content on their Instagram and TikTok accounts, like this Reel that explores the different signs in the workplace:\n\nStep 4: Collaborate with influencers\n\nIf you haven’t already, it’s time to tap into the power of influencer marketing. Social partnerships are very effective when executed correctly: they can help drive traffic to your website, produce compelling content and inspire purchase decisions.\n\nBut consumers care about creators’ qualifications, so choose wisely. The two most important qualifications of content creators working with brands is their experience with the product/service and their authenticity.\n\nIdentify creators who align with your brand and consider how they can help you craft stand-out content for your audience.\n\nWhat consumers want from influencer-brand collaborations\n\nAccording to the 2024 Influencer Marketing Report, consumers overall look to engage with influencers who align with their personal values (53%) and seem authentic (47%), even when posting sponsored content and taking part in brand campaigns.\n\nAcross ages and genders, honest and unbiased content stops audiences mid-scroll, while aspirational content is least likely to catch their attention.\n\nHowever, the report also found that authenticity is losing its appeal among younger generations. While trust in influencers remains strong—and is even growing among younger consumers—only 35% of Gen Z value authenticity, compared to nearly half of Millennials, Gen X‌ and Baby Boomers.\n\nThis indicates that younger generations are more aware of the influencer-brand relationship and how it influences their buying decisions, but they’re comfortable with it. Instead, they prioritize other indicators of trustworthiness, such as follower count, posting frequency‌ and community loyalty.\n\nStep 5: Bring other departments into the mix\n\nSocial media teams have a unique advantage when it comes to understanding customer sentiment. You’re the eyes and ears for your brand online. Those insights can do more than just inform marketing strategy.\n\nThey can transform your business. Stand-out social media teams will approach cross-department collaboration with enthusiasm and intention.\n\nWhich departments can benefit from social data?\n\nThe short answer? All of them. Index data shows around three-quarters of marketing leaders already say organic and paid social marketing are top priorities for the organization.\n\nHowever, don’t bite off more than you can chew. Instead, start where you think you can make the most impact. Here are a few ideas to jumpstart your strategy.\n\nHuman Resources\n\nCollaborating with human resources on social-first employer brand initiatives can do more than just fill open roles quickly. It can attract stronger, more qualified candidates as well. Many companies have embraced social recruiting strategies, such as publishing creative “we’re hiring” posts on LinkedIn to attract top talent.\n\nSales\n\nData from The 2023 Sprout Social Index™ notes marketers planned to track conversations and sales directly resulting from social efforts in 2024 to better connect the value of social to business goals. Sharing social insights with your sales organization can empower reps to work smarter in the context of increasingly digital customer journeys. Consider learning more about social selling to leverage the power of online networks even further.\n\nProduct and merchandising\n\nYou’ve probably received quite a few feature or product requests while managing your brand’s social inbox.\n\nWith a social media management tool, you can distill those messages into actionable insights for your product or merchandising teams. These insights can complement existing roadmap research, creating a customer-focused plan that delights.\n\nCustomer care\n\nMonitoring customer service metrics like average reply time, average wait time and response volume can help your social customer care team identify what is working well and spot opportunities for improvement. Marketers are using social media customer service software to elevate their support strategies and get the most out of their tech stack.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate and improve your social media strategy\n\nBy now you should have a big-picture understanding of your social media strategy. However, it’s important to adapt your strategy throughout the year.\n\nWithout continuously analyzing your efforts, you’ll never know how one campaign did over another. Having a bird’s eye view of your social media activity helps put things into perspective. This means looking at your top-performing content and adjusting your campaigns when your content stalls.\n\nThere’s no denying that a lot of social media is a matter of trial-and-error. Monitoring the metrics behind your campaigns in real time allows you to make small tweaks to your social media marketing strategy rather than sweeping, time-consuming changes.\n\nDoing social media marketing right starts by being diligent about your data. You can be reactive in the short term to get the most out of your running campaigns, and then proactively use these takeaways to inform your next strategy overhaul.\n\nTo guarantee that you get in front of as many customers as possible, monitoring your growth is a major must-do. With Sprout, social reports can clue you in on everything from your top-performing content to how engaged your audience is. These reports are crucial for accountability and guaranteeing your numbers continue to tick upward.\n\nReporting on data is also important for the sake of sharing valuable insights from social with your coworkers and colleagues. Remember that 60% of organizations use social data daily—be one of the brands that embrace it.\n\nSharing this information in regular reports not only holds you accountable for your efforts but also highlights the impact and bottom-line results your social strategy produces.\n\nBased on your data, you can better assess whether your KPIs truly ladder up to your overarching company goals or whether they need to change.\n\nAnd with that, we wrap up your social media strategy guide for 2024 and beyond!\n\nIs your social media marketing strategy future proof?\n\nThis guide highlights plenty of moving pieces to maintain a modern social presence. That said, putting together yours doesn’t have to be a drag.\n\nIf you set actionable goals and address each of the steps above, you’ll already be way ahead of the curve when it comes to your social media marketing strategy.",
      "# [Meta Shops \"Upgraded\" Checkout (ie, 2.9% processing fee)](https://community.sproutsocial.com/social-data-68/meta-shops-upgraded-checkout-ie-2-9-processing-fee-1644)\nHi guys,\n\nOk, I need some help pulling some data. Basically, our team is trying to decide if it’s worth it to eat the processing fee (2.9% for us) that Meta will begin requiring in order to operate a facebook/instagram shop on April 24th. I have been tasked with researching the value of keeping our Facebook/Instagram shops, and I’m trying to pull some data on how many times our “tagged products” from posts were actually clicked on. This is proving difficult because Meta has recently disabled the product tagging feature to anyone who hasn’t “upgraded” their shops. Does anyone know how to get this metric?\n\nAdditionally, curious to know if anyone else is in the same situation. If so, what type of business do you work for/own and how did you make your decision to keep or to close your Facebook/IG shop?",

I am trying to grow my nonprofit’s Instagram account, and recently realized our Stories are not sharable on Instagram. Our posts, however, are sharable.\n\nI’ve looked at our Stories from multiple other accounts and indeed they cannot be shared on Instagram. Several of my colleagues have asked me to fix this so they can share our company posts - which I really would love them to do!\n\nI’ve been through all our settings and everything looks good - all content is sharable, we are public, we have a business account….\n\nHas anyone had this happen and figured out how to fix it?? I submitted a request for help via Instagram but I’m not optimistic about hearing back...\n\nDo you mean you’ve posted a story to your organization’s account and someone wants to share that story to their stories?\n\nTo do that, you have to tag the person or account. You can either tag them right away (@their.account). If you forget to do this, you can hit the little three buttons (more) in the lower left corner and “add mentions” and add them that way.\n\nah - I thought any account can share the IG Story of another account unless sharing is turned off?? Is that not the case??\n\nBasically - In settings I’ve enabled sharing for the nonprofit’s account, but then when I am logged into my personal account, indeed I cannot share the Story from the nonprofit’s account.\n\nCorrect, it isn’t the case. A story can be shared to others as a DM, but not to other’s stories unless the person is tagged.\n\nTry tagging yourself in the organization’s story, then you will be able to share to your stories.",
