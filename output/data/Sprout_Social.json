      "# [Sprout Social by Melissa Flowers on 2018-09-21](https://sproutsocial.com/security/)\nReliability & availability\n\nSprout Social strives to minimize service impacts and downtime. We design our systems for fault tolerance, and our teams are trained for rapid incident recovery. It is in our ethos to avoid downtime at all costs, unplanned or planned. We never impose maintenance downtime if it is avoidable—because it usually is. Elements of business continuity and disaster recovery are woven into our practices and our systems. They are not an afterthought, or a task relegated to a single team.\n\nA proven track-record\n\n99.99% uptime is a key performance indicator (KPI) for our Engineering group. At the time of writing, we had higher than 99.95% uptime over the prior 6 and 12 months.\n\nTransparency to customers\n\nTrust begins with open communication. We publicly share real-time system status and metrics on our Status Websites, https://www.sproutsocialstatus.com for Sprout Social and https://www.sproutadvocacystatus.com for Employee Advocacy. There we communicate incidents and planned maintenance, including any customer impact, and we display system health metrics sourced from independent third-party providers. Customers may subscribe to receive immediate SMS or email notifications of future incidents.\n\nSocial media feeds\n\nOur data ingest layer combines multiple connections to social network APIs. As partners, social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn provide us with higher levels of redundancy and access to their support teams.\n\nBackups\n\nBackups are taken frequently, encrypted in transit and at rest, and are tested regularly. Backups are kept \"off-site\" in Amazon S3 which stores files on multiple physical devices in multiple facilities offering 99.999999999% durability and 99.99% availability.\n\nTransparency to our teams\n\nInternally we practice multidisciplinary, blameless post-mortem analysis, and seek to grow our people, procedures, and systems in the aftermath of failure. Fear is the enemy of progress.\n\nIsolation\n\nOur highly distributed backend platform employs isolation design patterns to mitigate risks across components. Failures of one component rarely affect other components.\n\nRecovery point objectives (RPOs)\n\nRecovery strategies are designed to provide up-to-date RPOs at low Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs), with older data recovered against longer RTOs. This is consistent with customer expectations in Social Media, allowing customers to meet the immediate needs of their customers.\n\nDevOps best practices\n\nOur engineering team practices Infrastructure-as-code, providing correctness, consistency, testability, and speed to recovery. All 24/7/365 on-call team members are empowered to rebuild systems and topologies with full consistency. In the event of system loss, our Engineering team quickly recreates systems by executing the infrastructure code.\n\nMonitoring & on-call support\n\nWe monitor continuously from around the world, displaying, alerting, and reporting upon our entire technical environments in real-time. Supporting customers is a collaboration between our customer-facing support team and our engineering team. Specialized engineers are on call 24/7/365.\n\nWhen problems occur our teams are promptly notified, automatically provided with context, and are enabled with tools to help collaborate efficiently with peers. We employ a triage pager system to ensure alerts quickly and reliably reach engineers.\n\nEncryption at rest & in transit\n\nAll communications over public networks with Sprout Social’s application and API utilize HTTPS with TLS 1.2 or higher enforced. All data is stored encrypted-at-rest with AES-256 or greater, including backups.\n\nSystem administration\n\nBest practices are utilized, such as least privilege, central configuration management, and stringent host and network firewall policies. Servers are patched automatically on a regular schedule, with high-priority patches applied manually out-of-cycle.\n\nThird party risk management\n\nSprout Social reviews the security posture of our critical third party product and service providers on a regular basis. Sprout Social's subprocessors are contractually required to adhere to an established set of security measures that align with industry best practices.\n\nInformation security policies & standards\n\nSprout Social has implemented a strong information security management system through a comprehensive set of policies and standards covering all aspects of security and privacy. All Employees must affirm their responsibilities in protecting customer data as part of their condition of employment.\n\nSecure support protocols\n\nOur world-class Support team follows phishing and threat-resistant protocols designed by our Security team, when conducting sensitive actions on customer accounts.\n\nOffices\n\nSprout Social offices are secured by keycard access. Office networks are segmented, centrally monitored, and protected by firewalls and Intrusion Prevention devices. Our products have no dependencies on our company’s offices or other facilities we manage.\n\nDevices\n\nAll Sprout Social devices are inventoried with asset tags and managed with a central mobile device management (MDM) solution.\n\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA)\n\nAccount owners and administrators may require that their users leverage this additional security layer. Sprout Social supports apps like Google Authenticator and others that implement the Time-based One-time Password Algorithm (TOTP) or HMAC-based One-time Password Algorithm (HOTP) for generating passcodes.\n\nSecure credential storage\n\nAccount passwords are salted and hashed using the latest strong algorithms and approaches, which are routinely audited. No human, our staff included, can ever view them. If you lose your password, it can't be recovered and must be reset.\n\nBrute-force protections\n\nIn addition to computationally challenging hashing, our authentication services implement additional rate-limiting protections and ReCAPTCHA.\n\nApproval workflows\n\nAccount Owners and Administrators may restrict certain activities behind approval workflows. These allow for tasks to be divided amongst a team, with the peace of mind that central decision makers may review and control public-facing actions.\n\nIP restrictions\n\nSprout Social may be configured to restrict application and API access from specific IP ranges.\n\nSingle sign-on (SSO)\n\nSprout Social offers SAML 2.0 Single sign-on (SSO) for organizations that leverage this authentication service to give employees one set of login credentials to access multiple applications. Our engineering team works with customers to implement custom SSO integrations across both web and mobile.\n\nEmail signing\n\nSprout Social implements Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) to ensure emails we send are authenticated as coming from Sprout Social, helping to prevent spoofing and ensure authenticity.\n\nAccess permissions\n\nAccount Owners and Administrators may restrict access to profiles, features, actions (including read and write), and other data, by applying granular controls to users on their account.\n\nGlobal publishing pause\n\nIn times of crisis, your team has access to one button that temporarily disables any automated scheduled and queued messages from being sent by Sprout Social. This is accessible from our web and mobile applications.\n\nCustomer protection\n\nSprout Social wants to help you protect yourself from online security threats and have created resources designed to do that, including Security Best Practices and Protecting sensitive information.",

      "# [What is EdgeRank? on 2019-12-17](https://sproutsocial.com/glossary/edgerank/)\nFacebook EdgeRank was another name for the old Facebook algorithm.\n\nThe Facebook algorithm determines how posts are presented to your potential customers and followers. EdgeRank and the newer algorithms use a multitude of mathematical variables and operations to measure the popularity and potential of the material you create for social media.\n\nAccording to Facebook, their algorithm delivers the content that customers most want to see. In recent years, this has lead to a reduced focus on promoted content, and a higher level of priority given to organic material on Facebook.\n\nHow did EdgeRank work?\n\nEdgerank was designed by Serkan Piantino to help organize the masses of material published to Facebook every day. In 2011, Facebook stopped using the EdgeRank system and started to use machine learning algorithms instead.\n\nThe adoption of machine learning means that the new Facebook algorithm is capable of becoming more intelligent and accurate over time. In 2013, the learning algorithm assessed more than 100,000 factors when ranking content. Since then, the level of data that goes into the Facebook algorithm has continued to grow.\n\nThe EdgeRank formula used three main factors to arrange material on your Facebook feed, including:\n\nThe freshness or recency of a post\n\nThe actions taken by users on the post (engagement such as likes, comments and shares)\n\nUser affinity – the relationship between the person viewing the post and the company or individual that published the material.\n\nWhat happened to EdgeRank?\n\nEdgerank was replaced by the machine learning algorithm that Facebook uses today, to ensure that the social channel could deliver the highest quality of content for users. In 2018, Facebook announced that it would be pushing back against branded content and giving audiences more of the authentic, valuable posts they were looking for on the channel.\n\nDespite this, Facebook continues to deliver one of the best ROIs for social media marketers, thanks to the size of the network’s user base.\n\nThe latest algorithm is very similar to Edgerank, as it still considers the “affinity” between people when determining where content should rank. The new algorithm also values genuine engagement too. This means that companies can achieve more considerable attention online by encouraging people to like and comment on their posts.\n\nWhenever the algorithm updates, it means that companies on Facebook need to come up with a new plan for interacting with followers online. In the case of the most recent update, some key tips include:",

It’s such a bummer. I’ve asked this a couple times too. Most of the answers if you search the thread are dated. \n\nI also have a comparison chart, and I’m lukewarm on all the things I’ve tried. IMO none are all encompassing with the things I need and also affordable. It’s the tiny things that really irritate me about the management tools, like not being able to schedule a story or tag a photo. I do realize Meta (ugh) locks some of this down as well. \n\nI find that Hootsuite, Sprout, Buffer are all basically the same so it just comes down to preference and price.\n\n### Comment ID k0b1n6x with +5 score by [(beansauer, Reddit, 2023-09-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialMediaMarketing/comments/16h0qx6/what_social_management_tool_do_you_use_and/k0b1n6x/) (in reply to ID k0azsu6):\nI appreciate the feedback and hear you on the similarity point.

Are you an individual looking to manage a few accounts yourself, or do you need a solution for collaborating with a team? Do you need robust analytics and reporting, or is basic scheduling and publishing sufficient? Answering these types of questions will help narrow down the best fit.  \nA few tools that I've used personally and would recommend based on different scenarios include:  \n1. For individuals or solopreneurs on a budget, Buffer is a great free option that allows scheduling posts in advance to multiple networks. It has all the essential features one needs without a steep learning curve.  \n2. SocialPilot provides a good balance of features and affordability for small businesses looking for more functionality. Things like content curation, analytics, and team collaboration are included in their pricing plans.  \n3. Hootsuite would serve larger companies that need enterprise-level support well. They offer high-volume account management, advanced analytics, and 24/7 support to meet the needs of large marketing teams.  \nNo matter which tool you choose, take advantage of free trials to test the features for yourself before committing. And remember, consistent posting, engaging content, and listening to your audience - those human elements are just as crucial for success on social media as any tool.\n\n### Comment ID l424pxw with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-05-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialMediaMarketing/comments/16h0qx6/what_social_management_tool_do_you_use_and/l424pxw/) (in reply to ID k0efmk0):\n\\^\\^\\^ we can all plug stuff into AI text generators ourselves but thanks anyway!\n\n## Comment ID k0fdtt3 with +1 score by [(makedas, Reddit, 2023-09-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialMediaMarketing/comments/16h0qx6/what_social_management_tool_do_you_use_and/k0fdtt3/) (in reply to ID 16h0qx6):\nI’ve used Later & SproutSocial for jobs but have just switched to Pallyy for client work because it’s really affordable!

It also shows benchmarking and has a good Instagram competitor benchmarking (although I wish they had this for all platforms!) \n\nI don't like the main post crafting section compared to sprout social or loomly. This is because you can't adjust the post to fit with different platform requirements. So you'd have to either create one post to all platforms and not have it adjusted for each platform (tags, hashtags, character limit etc). OR create the same post 3 or 4 times over for different platforms.\n\nWith other tools I've used you can individually tweak within the one post.

The way their platform is setup makes it really easy to schedule social posts quickly. I especially love the way it integrates with our blog which is hosted on WordPress. They release updates pretty regularly to keep up with updates of social platforms.

HootSuite lets you manage social media channels and you can use it to delegate tasks to other users.

Funny enough I guess we were onboard early enough that we basically got the royal treatment for what we were paying. We had bi monthly meetings with our account rep for planning but unfortunately my manager was never prepared and never followed through with what we spoke about. They were spoon feeding us and we couldn’t even get it together for that. Total waste for how lucky we were. \n\nANYWAY long story short I think that if you get those meetings with their reps they really are a wealth of info. I agree its super expensive and I believe the majority of people probably aren’t getting their bang for their buck. You have to already know what to do with the info or get the Cadillac 1 on 1 plan. \n\nIf you care about lead gen and customer info it’s great but I found their social aspect to be nothing special. \n\nTheir inbound is 10/10 as far as conferences go, though.\n\n#### Comment ID ds6hgxw with +1 score by [(Imindless, Reddit, 2018-01-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/7nvxah/sprout_social_hootsuite_hubspot_what_software/ds6hgxw/) (in reply to ID ds5rert):\nSay social is out, but lead gen/CRM is in. \n\nHow does it differ from another platform and why is lead gen so good with HubSpot? \n\nI ask because we are also looking into a lead gen platform.

I think most smaller businesses really only need that. Decent email marketing/automation software and a CRM for their sales/marketing needs. \n\nWhat you already have will take you quite far as well. All these software companies promise many things. But those promises are for \"best case scenario\" customers - most customers aren't that. Heck, I'd say 90% of customers aren't that. A company like MailChimp creates a version of their product for every tier of customer, plus automation is free now, so it's still the way to go.\n\nOne thing I would add is to forgo a social media publishing tool. Posting natively will get you perfectly good results and exceptional data. The time you \"save\" by bulk scheduling or whatever, is moot for the intentions of \"social\" media. Right now we bulk schedule with HubSpot's tool and one of my goals for 2018 is to complete abandon it.

The primary reason for switching is that when it comes to posting content, it's unbeatable.\n\nBuffer is a product that is great if your team is OK with using multiple tools to service a client's social media marketing needs.  The API and integrations make this an excellent tool if you've got some tech skills to use the data they collect to create reports yourself.  Of course there are product like DashThis that fill that gap if you aren't a coder.\n\nIf you want a one size fits all tool to manage posting,  social mentions, etc.. in one interface,  Sprout is your solution.  In fact I greatly miss the Inbox that would collect all the social mentions into one place.  I have yet to find a replacement for that feature.\n\nIf you want a rock solid posting tool and a way to manage your evergreen content for near automated re-promotion, go with Buffer.  \n\nAnd, yes; the price is a factor.  I asked Sprout for 5 more profiles and they quoted me a laughable amount.  Not figuratively, literally laughably expensive.\n\nIf you do go with Buffer,  augment it with something like Mention.net and DashThis.\n\n## Comment ID d42t065 with +3 score by [(melissadingmon, Reddit, 2016-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/4ncqdc/buffer_v_sprout_social/d42t065/) (in reply to ID 4ncqdc):\n\"Hootsuite is garbage\" = upvote.\n\n## Comment ID d42w60z with +2 score by [(SproutRachael, Reddit, 2016-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/4ncqdc/buffer_v_sprout_social/d42w60z/) (in reply to ID 4ncqdc):\nHey, Megan. My name is Rachael. I love this post, great questions. Full disclosure: I work for Sprout. However, like you i've been using the platform for years. Long before I ever started working here. I've been an independent social media manager for a variety of businesses for over 6 years, but was always a team of one. I never understood how important all the team capabilities and functions were in sprout until i actually got here and became part of a larger team. For what it's worth, i highly recommend you take a good look at all the team functionality. IMHO there is very little out there that compares. Feel free to reach out to me if you'd rather. I know that didn't answer your question about buffer in entirety, but I thought I had some relevant insight. Anywho, happy to help with anything Sprout and good luck. I hope you get some really valuable feedback.\n\n\nRachael :)\n\n## Comment ID d42vh33 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2016-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/4ncqdc/buffer_v_sprout_social/d42vh33/) (in reply to ID 4ncqdc):\nPM me if you want another recommendation!

I think a lot of this depends on how you use social media. If social activity has to show a solid ROI then you need a tool that does the analytics and tagging well, if it's a publisher then speed and ease of use will be a big factor, if it's for customer service then you need something that can integrate with CRM and also allow assignment to team members. Currently I'm working on large in-house social accounts so not sure how relevant this would be but we use Socialbakers builder platform which looks a bit hootsuite-ish and does some pretty neat reporting, listening and analysis as well allowing team collaboration.\n\n## Comment ID d42xto1 with +1 score by [(b00mtown, Reddit, 2016-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/4ncqdc/buffer_v_sprout_social/d42xto1/) (in reply to ID 4ncqdc):\nSprout is the best.

Sprinklr beats all those options hands down. It offers power years beyond what any of them will be able to develop in the next 5.\n\nSprout looks nice and has pretty reports but it's nowhere in the same realm as Sprinklr when it comes to offering for large enterprise.\n\nWe have more than 1200 company accounts and over 10k employees managing their social presences through Sprinkler. You simply can't do that with Buffer, HootSuite, or Sprout.\n\nWhile I use Buffer constantly each day for managing a couple dozen personal and business accounts and have a Sprout account they provide for me which I use from time to time, there's no question which route I'd go if I was managing a large social project. Though if you're just a small agency with a couple clients and small social programs, I can see how Sprinklr may be too much. It's for enterprise social while the others aren't. Really an apples to oranges.\n\n#### Comment ID d43y72z with +1 score by [(b00mtown, Reddit, 2016-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/4ncqdc/buffer_v_sprout_social/d43y72z/) (in reply to ID d434zhk):\nI am at a medium creative agency with international clients. As a one person social department you have totally hit the nail on the head. Sprinklr represents the hopes and dreams of my client, which has thousands of locations worldwide that they someday hope to have all connected through the platform. In the very long meantime I am stuck running a motocross race in a dump truck. \n\nI am impressed with Sprinklr in a lot of ways, but running point on engagement makes the terrible UI stand out. Once the client realizes they need an internal team to start managing some of their social, it will get better and I will probably enjoy using Sprinklr more. \n\nThat being said, I have run very large scale social projects with Sprinklr in the past (another agency, tool dictated by clients) and Sprinklr has absolutely shit the bed on me. Reps promised what they couldn't deliver and in the 11th hour I had to rely on other tools. \n\nSprinklr is a great tool for client side social depts. I think agencies who really want to build out social should rely on a constellation of tools to get the best product. All tools promise a one-stop shop and all tools are awful at at least 1 thing (if not more). Sprinklr is no exception. \n\nEDIT: I should add that this is how I feel. This is my opinion. People can second guess my agency's roster, experience, my inability to learn/use the tool etc. but at the end of the day when I log in to the desktop or app, I am not impressed with how the tool functions or the choices Sprinklr has made.\n\n### Comment ID d435wtq with +1 score by [(PotatoFirelord, Reddit, 2016-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/4ncqdc/buffer_v_sprout_social/d435wtq/) (in reply to ID d42xto1):\nI'm also curious to know what you dont like about Sprinklr.

Get it right from the hose.\n\n## Comment ID lnv2bjd with +1 score by [(kulsoomawan, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialMediaMarketing/comments/1dfygy3/sprout_social/lnv2bjd/) (in reply to ID 1dfygy3):\nSprout is good but i found Social Champ to be more reasonable and decent\n\n## Comment ID m0byhfq with +1 score by [(Sahni_4721, Reddit, 2024-12-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialMediaMarketing/comments/1dfygy3/sprout_social/m0byhfq/) (in reply to ID 1dfygy3):\nThis is sad because they charge a lot. Sprout Social is considered super expensive and not for small teams. Did you try Sprout Social alternatives that require a lower investment, like Statusbrew and Agorapulse? Do they have the same issue? let me know\n\n## Comment ID mbh8xrd with +1 score by [(Copy_physio_123, Reddit, 2025-02-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialMediaMarketing/comments/1dfygy3/sprout_social/mbh8xrd/) (in reply to ID 1dfygy3):\nYeah, I’ve noticed discrepancies with Sprout too. Sometimes third-party tools estimate metrics differently than native platforms. If you need more accurate reporting, Planable, might be worth a try, they pull data straight from IG/FB without as much mismatch.\n\n## Comment ID miibhn3 with +1 score by [(thijsgh, Reddit, 2025-03-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialMediaMarketing/comments/1dfygy3/sprout_social/miibhn3/) (in reply to ID 1dfygy3):\nSocialRails is good if you just need a simple social media scheduler",
      "# Post ID bke5cl: Sprout Social - Issues posting videos to Instagram? with +1 score by [(kittkat03, Reddit, 2019-05-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialMediaMarketing/comments/bke5cl/sprout_social_issues_posting_videos_to_instagram/)\nThere's a lot that I like about Sprout (namely the first comment scheduler), but I keep running into a snafu. \n\nHas anyone else had MASSIVE failure rates on Instagram video posts? I've talked to them about it, and they say there's a bug with Instagram's API integration with **videos**, but it's not an image issue. Probably 60-80% of my scheduled video posts fail. And since over 90% of our posts are videos, and we post 4-6 times a day... I'm getting tired of not feeling like it's reliable. It's almost worse to do it manually but reliably than think you have things all scheduled and off your plate only to find out you have to do it manually anyways.\n\nAnyone else having issues with this? Can't tell if it's a significant issue clients are having or if they're BSing me and swatting the fly away.\n\n## Comment ID emg47ow with +1 score by [(neuro_beats, Reddit, 2019-05-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialMediaMarketing/comments/bke5cl/sprout_social_issues_posting_videos_to_instagram/emg47ow/) (in reply to ID bke5cl):\nMy account straight up told me I couldn’t schedule multiple pics or vids.\n\n### Comment ID emg8kto with +1 score by [(kittkat03, Reddit, 2019-05-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialMediaMarketing/comments/bke5cl/sprout_social_issues_posting_videos_to_instagram/emg8kto/) (in reply to ID emg47ow):\nThat's always been a limitation - you can only add one media per post.

Is this is a bad deal? It seems like a lot. \n\nWe only use FB, X, IG, is there any other place we can try that has good listening and detailed .csv reports for maybe 20 accounts?\n\n\n\n\n## Comment ID mci4ou7 with +5 score by [(Sahni_4721, Reddit, 2025-02-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialMediaMarketing/comments/1io8mae/sprout_social_quote/mci4ou7/) (in reply to ID 1io8mae):\nIs listening the priority?

You can try Hootsuite, Brandwatch, or Meltwater for listening (Social + Web)\n\nThe problem with these big tools is that their prices keep increasing, and you realize one day that you are only using a few features and paying for all the other useless features as well.\n\nFor social media management at fair cost, Statusbrew, Agora, Planable can help.\n\nStatusbrew has social listening for X, Instagram, and Reddit.\n\n## Comment ID mcipuus with +3 score by [(ShivamGun, Reddit, 2025-02-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialMediaMarketing/comments/1io8mae/sprout_social_quote/mcipuus/) (in reply to ID 1io8mae):\nThis seems way too high for your scale!\n\nDo demos with Statusbrew and Agorapulse!

Yikes, that’s a lot of dough! 😅 I mean, unless they’re sending you a private jet with that deal, you might want to look elsewhere.\n\nI've been using Keyhole and Mentionlytics for a while now, both are absolute game-changers—and at a fraction of that price. You get amazing social listening across FB, X, IG, and beyond, with detailed .csv reports that will blow your mind. Plus, you won’t need to remortgage your house to afford them.

The once-unique culture, has been replaced by a typical tech company environment focused on growth and profit, complete with political bureaucracy. \nIf you're accustomed to the structure and bureaucracy of a large tech company, you may find Sprout's current environment familiar. However, if you're seeking a departure from that type of culture, Sprout may no longer offer the change you desire.",

It also felt like feedback fell on deaf ears, and whenever feedback was submitted, it didn't matter at all. My biggest feedback is that Support feels like the red-headed stepchild of the company. There's always this pressure to meet metrics and when you mention you feel burnt out, they tell you to have a \"growth mindset\". Whenever there are company events or R&amp;R days, you can't actually take advantage of that because someone has to be scheduled to work to meet these impossible goals/metrics. You're expected to be a team player and say yes to increasing tasks or schedule changes, even if your workload is heavy. This adds onto more pressure and if you try to set boundaries (like they encourage), you're given negative feedback. After some turnover of more tenured employees (which is telling), it felt like nothing was done to boost team morale and we were still held to an impossibly high standard. All in all, Sprout is probably a great company to work for but the Support team is not.",

Not only that, promotions and raises do not come easily even if you consistently exceed goals and metrics. It also felt like feedback fell on deaf ears, and whenever feedback was submitted, it didn't matter at all. My biggest feedback is that Support feels like the red-headed stepchild of the company. There's always this pressure to meet metrics and when you mention you feel burnt out, they tell you to have a \"growth mindset\". Whenever there are company events or R&amp;R days, you can't actually take advantage of that because someone has to be scheduled to work to meet these impossible goals/metrics. You're expected to be a team player and say yes to increasing tasks or schedule changes, even if your workload is heavy. This adds onto more pressure and if you try to set boundaries (like they encourage), you're given negative feedback. After some turnover of more tenured employees (which is telling), it felt like nothing was done to boost team morale and we were still held to an impossibly high standard.

The once-unique culture, has been replaced by a typical tech company environment focused on growth and profit, complete with political bureaucracy. \nIf you're accustomed to the structure and bureaucracy of a large tech company, you may find Sprout's current environment familiar.

      "# [80+ Must-know social media marketing statistics for 2025 by Mahnoor Sheikh on 2025-02-20](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-statistics/)\nDiscover the latest social media statistics to refine your strategy, uncover new opportunities and stay ahead in 2025.\n\nReading time 10 minutes\n\nPublished on February 20, 2025\n\nTable of Contents\n\nShare\n\nEmail\n\nShare Resource\n\nSummary\n\nIn 2025, there are estimated to be 5.42 billion total social media users worldwide, with an average person using 6.83 different social networks per month.\n\nSocial media advertising spend is projected to reach $276.7 billion in 2025, with 83% of that ad spend total generated on mobile by 2030.\n\nVideo content continues to be popular, with 78% of people preferring to learn about new products through short video content and 93% of marketers reporting they'll spend more time on social marketing in 2025.\n\nSocial media went through a monumental shift in 2024.\n\nAI-generated content flooded feeds, engagement became harder to earn and algorithms started favoring interactions over reach.\n\nIn 2025, the shift will be even bigger.\n\nAudiences will demand more authenticity. Platforms will double down on real conversations. And brands that fail to adapt will struggle to scale their engagement and growth. The marketers who win won’t be the ones posting the most, but the ones making data-driven decisions.\n\nKnowing platform-specific demographics and usage patterns as well as the overall state of the industry can help you tailor your social media marketing strategy to boost engagement and ROI.\n\nLet’s look at the top social media statistics to guide your presence in 2025.\n\nSocial media usage statistics\n\nWe all know social media is ingrained in daily life, but how people use it is changing. While growth may seem slow, that’s only because most of the world is already online.\n\nHere’s a quick snapshot of the top social media demographics and usage stats.\n\nIn 2025, there are estimated to be 5.42 billion total social media users worldwide.\n\nThe average person uses 6.83 different social networks per month.\n\nNearly half (48%) of consumers said they interact with brands more often on social media than six months ago.\n\nNinety percent of consumers rely on social media to keep up with trends and cultural moments.\n\nThe amount of time internet users spend on social media declined slightly to 141 minutes per day.\n\nWith users juggling nearly seven platforms a month, brands can’t afford a single-channel approach. A tailored presence on multiple social networks is key to maximizing reach and engagement across the board. While much of the following content is globally applicable, delving into our UK social media statistics can provide valuable insights if you're targeting that market, thanks to unique cultural nuances.\n\nSocial media advertising statistics and ROI\n\nSocial media advertising is no longer a backup plan – it’s crucial for visibility. Paid ads now dominate social feeds, driving brand awareness, sales and engagement.\n\nLearn more about social advertising and ROI stats to inform your strategy.\n\nTotal spend on social media advertising is projected to reach $276.7 billion in 2025.\n\nIt's now projected that 83% of total social media ad spending will be generated through mobile by 2030.\n\nSocial media ads are the leading source of brand awareness among internet users aged 16 to 34.\n\nAd spending on social media is expected to grow by 9.37% each year from 2025 to 2030.\n\nSocial media ads account for 3 in every 10 dollars spent on digital advertising.\n\nMarketers spend an average of $46.47 per user to reach social audiences.\n\nAs more businesses invest in ads, competition is increasing. Brands that want strong ROI will need to work harder. Prioritizing audience targeting, creativity and strategic budgeting will separate winners from those just burning through ad dollars.\n\nFacebook statistics\n\nWhether or not brands should focus on Facebook is a tough question that really depends on your individual Facebook metrics. But the platform’s near-universal adoption, strong marketing appeal and ability to drive direct purchases remains unmatched.\n\nThe following Facebook statistics can clue you in further.\n\nNinety percent of consumers maintain a profile on Facebook.\n\nFacebook is the largest social network in the world with roughly 3.065 billion monthly active users.\n\nFacebook is the most-used platform by marketers worldwide (86%). Instagram sits in second place (79%).\n\nFacebook’s biggest user group is males aged 25–34, accounting for 18.4% of its global audience, with males aged 18–24 ranking second (13.5%). Female audiences aged 25–34 are the third largest demographic using Facebook.\n\nFacebook is the top platform for direct purchases, with 39% of consumers turning to it when they’re ready to buy. TikTok (36%) and Instagram (29%) follow closely behind.\n\nThe average American spends about 32 minutes per day on Facebook.\n\nThe platform’s aging demographic means marketers targeting decision-makers and high-income consumers should take full advantage. A mix of paid advertising, groups and community-driven content is the best way to stay relevant on Facebook.\n\nInstagram statistics\n\nWhile Instagram remains a top destination for product discovery, its overall engagement rate has dropped. At the same time, younger users increasingly rely on Instagram for customer service interactions, showing a shift toward more functional use.\n\nBelow are the top social media statistics for Instagram.\n\nInstagram has 2 billion monthly active users.\n\nAbout 82% of social users have profiles on Instagram, second only to Facebook (90%).\n\nAs of January 2025, 28.3% of US Instagram users are between 25 and 34 years old.\n\nGlobally, Instagram users mostly identify as male.\n\nUS adults spend an average of 32 minutes per day on Instagram.\n\nInstagram offers a total potential ad reach of 1.74 billion users.\n\nSixty-nine percent of social users say they see the most engaging brand content on Instagram, and 44% wish brands used Instagram more often..\n\nInstagram is the top channel for product discovery, with 61% using it to find their next purchase.\n\nSeventy-two percent of Gen Z users prefer Instagram for customer care over any other channel.\n\nInstagram’s engagement rate dropped by 28% YoY to 0.50% (from 0.70%), which is still more than three times higher than Facebook (0.15%).\n\nBrands on Instagram should focus more on ecommerce features, quick-response messaging and interactive formats like Stories and Reels. Engagement might be dipping, but those who adapt their Instagram strategy can still tap into its high-value audience.\n\nLinkedIn statistics\n\nLinkedIn continues to grow as the go-to platform for professionals and B2B marketing. With a high concentration of decision-makers and business leaders, it remains an ideal space for thought leadership and lead generation.\n\nHere are some LinkedIn statistics you should know.\n\nThere are more than more than 1 billion members across 200 countries on LinkedIn.\n\nForty-three percent of all social users have a LinkedIn profile.\n\nThe United States has the highest user rate in the world on LinkedIn with an audience reach of over 234 million users.\n\nThere are over 67 million company profiles on LinkedIn.\n\n50.6% of worldwide users are between ages 25 and 34 years old, far exceeding any other age group.\n\nA quarter of LinkedIn users engage with brand content daily (or more).\n\nText posts and static images drive the most engagement on LinkedIn.\n\nSpurred by the widespread career changes over the past few years, the platform doesn’t look to slow down any time soon. Brands targeting young professionals should prioritize high-quality content, industry insights and personal branding in their LinkedIn marketing.\n\nPinterest statistics\n\nPinterest is often underestimated, yet it consistently delivers diverse, high-intent users who are actively searching for products and brands.\n\nHere are some top Pinterest statistics to look out for.\n\nPinterest has around 553 million monthly active users.\n\nAround 69.4% of Pinterest users identify as female, while 22.6% identify as male and 8% are of unspecified gender.\n\nIn March 2024, Pinterest.com received around 1.3 billion visits, making it one of the most-visited websites on the internet.\n\nPinterest is the second-most visited social media website in the US.\n\nAbout 80% of weekly users have found a new brand or product on the platform.\n\nA quarter (25%) of all social media users wish more brands used Pinterest, with this number rising to 31% among Gen Z.\n\nConsumers want to see more brand content on Pinterest, which means there’s a huge opportunity for marketers to invest in SEO-driven Pins, Pinterest advertising to capture an engaged audience ready to buy.\n\nReddit statistics\n\nReddit’s growth trajectory and increasing ad revenue marks its value as a niche marketing goldmine. Let’s look at the top Reddit statistics marketers need to know.\n\nThere are estimated to be 49 million Reddit users in 2025, with this number expected to grow to 556.59 million in 2028.\n\nAs of Q3 2024, 59.8% of Reddit users identify as male, while users who identify as women make up approximately 39.1%.\n\nReddit generated $315 million USD in advertising revenue in Q3 2024, marking a 56% increase from the previous year.\n\nIn January 2025 alone, Reddit was visited 3.8 billion times from desktop and mobile.\n\nMore than 50% of Reddit’s website traffic comes from the United States.\n\nAs of February 2024, r/funny was Reddit’s largest community with 56.6 million subscribers, followed by r/AskReddit with 45 million members.\n\nThe platform’s users demand authenticity and real conversations rather than promotional content. Brands must practice Reddit social listening, contribute meaningfully to discussions and avoid anything that feels like a hard sell.\n\nThreads statistics\n\nThreads is still finding its place, but its growth proves that users are interested in a new kind of text-based social experience. Here are some Threads statistics to be aware of.\n\nBy Q4 2024, Threads reached 275 million monthly active users, rising from 200 million in the third quarter.\n\nUsers spend an average of 3 minutes and 51 seconds on the website per visit.\n\nMore than half of Threads users are male, while the dominating age group on the site is 25-34 year olds.\n\nMeta’s newest platform is attracting users who engage in short, casual discussions rather than algorithm-driven content. Brands that experiment with Threads now can carve out a strong presence before competition intensifies.\n\nTikTok statistics\n\nTikTok isn’t slowing down. Even with bans and regulatory hurdles, people are still spending hours on the platform. Beyond watching entertaining videos, TikTok users are actively searching for, shopping and interacting with brands more than ever.\n\nHere are some useful TikTok statistics to keep in mind.\n\nAs of January 2025, TikTok receives around 2.65 billion monthly visits.\n\nTikTok offers a potential advertising reach of 1.59 billion users.\n\nAround 56% of social users have a TikTok profile, rising to 82% for Gen Z.\n\nAndroid phone users worldwide spend an average of 35 hours per month watching TikTok videos.\n\nAs of February 2025, TikTok’s global user base skews male, with 55.7% of users identifying as men (based on available gender data.)\n\nAs of February 2025, 35.3% of TikTok users are 25-34 years old, the largest age group on the platform, followed by users aged 18-24 years old (30.7%).\n\nTikTok is the top platform for product discovery among Gen Z.\n\nOver half (54%) of TikTok users engage with brand content daily on the platform.\n\nTikTok isn’t just for “young people” anymore. Gen Z is getting older and still using the platform in full force, even as a search engine. The brands winning here aren’t overthinking it. They’re jumping on trends, creating content that feels real and letting creators take the lead.\n\nIf you’re already on the platform, make sure to watch your TikTok analytics and how to reach your audience.\n\nX (formerly Twitter) statistics\n\nX, previously known as Twitter, remains a go-to platform for real-time discussions, news, memes and customer service. While some advertisers have pulled back, user activity remains strong, particularly for those seeking updates and fast-paced interactions.\n\nTake a look at the Twitter statistics below to understand more about marketing on the platform.\n\nX has about 611 million monthly active users in total worldwide.\n\nHalf of all social users have a profile on X.\n\nIn 2024, X recorded around 364 billion total user active seconds and 8.3 billion video views on a daily basis.\n\nMore than half (60.3%) of X users are men (based on available gender data).\n\nIn 2024, 59% of X users used the platform to get the latest news.\n\nEven as user preferences shift, the platform appears to be growing, so marketers may not want to count it out yet. The brands that thrive here are actively engaging in trending topics, responding quickly and maintaining a strong brand voice.\n\nYouTube statistics\n\nYouTube is still the top platform for video content, outpacing competitors in watch time and engagement. Here are the top YouTube statistics to know about.\n\nAs of April 2024, YouTube has nearly 2.5 billion users worldwide.\n\nAround 78% of all social users own a YouTube account.\n\nAs of February 2025, YouTube's biggest gender segments are males aged between 25-34 (12%), and males aged between 35-44 (10.1%). Audiences who identify as female in the same age groups are around 9.7% and 8.4%, respectfully.\n\nMore people spend time on YouTube than on any other social platform. In fact, users spend almost twice as much time on YouTube than on its next nearest rival, TikTok.\n\nAbout 70.29% of all visits to YouTube come from a mobile device.\n\nOver half of YouTube users prefer long-form brand videos, while 31-60 second videos are their second choice.\n\nWhile short-form videos are growing, long-form content still holds strong on YouTube, showing that users want both quick entertainment and in-depth insights. Use both formats as part of your YouTube marketing strategy to maximize audience retention and discoverability.\n\nSocial media video statistics\n\nVideo continues to be an all-time favorite content type. It’s versatile, engaging and offers excellent ROI to marketers worldwide. Let’s look at some recent social media video statistics.\n\nOver 80% of consumers wanted brands to focus on short-form video (< 30 secs) in 2024.\n\nAround 78% of people prefer to learn about a new product or service via short video content.\n\nAround 93% of marketers plan to spend the same or more on video marketing in 2025.\n\nMarketers say video has helped them improve user understanding of products or services (99%), increase brand awareness (96%), generate leads (88%) and boost website traffic (82%).\n\nThe global digital video advertising market is expected to grow from $104.65 billion in 2024 to $140.18 billion in 2025.\n\nMarketers need to focus on snackable, mobile-friendly video formats like Reels, TikTok and YouTube Shorts. More importantly, brands need to find ways to create videos that entertain, educate or inspire in under 30 seconds.\n\nInfluencer marketing statistics\n\nWorking with influencers is one of the best inbound marketing strategies being used today. More than ever, consumers are making purchase decisions based on influencer content.\n\nHere are some influencer marketing statistics about which platforms marketers are leveraging, what they’re hoping to achieve and how they plan to execute influencer marketing in the future.\n\nThe total influencer marketing market size is expected to grow to $32.55 billion in 2025, up from $24 billion in 2024.\n\nInstagram is the most preferred influencer marketing channel, with 57.1% of marketers using it to partner with creators. TikTok (51.6%) follows closely behind.\n\nNearly half of all consumers (49%) make purchases at least once a month because of influencer content.\n\nAbout 66.4% of marketers found that using AI improved the performance of their influencer marketing campaigns.\n\nAround 93% of influencers say the quality of a brand's existing social content affects their decision to collaborate.\n\nTo maximize impact, brands should prioritize creators who align with their values and have strong connections with their audience rather than wide reach.\n\nThe key is to pick the best platforms and influencers for your brand, both of which can be automated using the right influencer marketing tools.\n\nConsumer behavior statistics\n\nThe concept of buying something you saw on social media is not new. From product recommendations to first impressions from brands, the impact of social media on consumers is well-documented. Learn more from these consumer behavior statistics.\n\nFacebook (40%) and YouTube (32%) are the top social media platforms consumers use for reading reviews.\n\nNearly 56% of online adults make online purchases on a weekly basis.\n\nRoughly 81% of consumers say social media compels them to make spontaneous purchases multiple times per year or more, with 28% making impulse purchases once a month.\n\nAround 73% of social users agree if a brand doesn’t respond on social, they’ll buy from a competitor.\n\nNearly three-quarters of consumers expect a response within 24 hours or sooner, which is consistent with our data collected in 2022 and 2023.\n\nTrust plays a huge role in buying decisions.

Brands that engage, respond quickly and create genuine, user-generated content will earn loyalty.\n\nUse social media statistics to guide your strategy\n\nKeeping up with the latest social media marketing statistics helps you refine your strategy and set smarter goals.\n\nAre there emerging platforms worth exploring?

      "# [Best times to post on social media in 2025 by Mary Keutelian on 2025-03-26](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/best-times-to-post-on-social-media/)\nIn social media, timing is everything. Whether you want to join a trend or cultural moment or make the most of your social campaigns, when to post is just as important as what to post. Posting your content at the right time can determine the success of your social campaigns or leave you struggling to align social strategies to business goals.\n\nAs social networks evolve to further engage audiences in new ways, you need to nail your social media game and stay on top of these changes. This guide will walk you through the latest insights on the optimal posting times for major networks like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube. Once you understand how peak engagement periods affect your social strategy, you can tailor your efforts to sync with your audience’s habits.\n\nWe worked closely with Sprout’s Data Science team to uncover how users have been engaging with social media. We reviewed data from Sprout Social’s over 30,000 customers to understand when their content was most and least frequently engaged with, broken out by platform and industry.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nData from Sprout Social include users from various plan types, industries and locations. All times are recorded globally (not by US Central Time). We recommend testing with your own accounts to find the most optimal send times.\n\nIf you’re looking to dive deeper into platform-specific optimal engagement times, including industry posting times, review our guides on the following:\n\nBest times to post on Facebook in 2025\n\nBest times to post on Instagram in 2025\n\nBest times to post on LinkedIn in 2025\n\nBest times to post on TikTok in 2025\n\nBest times to post on X (FKA Twitter) in 2025\n\nWe’ve also uncovered the best posting times on social media for international audiences:\n\nBest times to post on social media in the UK in 2025\n\nBest times to post on social media in Australia in 2025\n\nUse the data from this article to help inform your publishing calendar. Still, the best way to identify your brand’s best times to post across each network is to start a free trial of Sprout Social and test our ViralPost® feature with your social profiles.\n\nStart a free Sprout Social trial\n\nBest times to post on social media\n\nWe analyzed nearly 2.5 billion engagements across 600,000 social profiles, including Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest, TikTok and YouTube. Our analysis uncovered some unique findings based on the data of our customers and their profile engagements.\n\nWhen deciding which social media network to prioritize for your brand, it all starts with determining your goals, campaigns, content types and target audience. Each channel has its own benefits and use cases, and with data-driven insights you can confidently make the decision about what to post and where.\n\nAccording to the 2025 Sprout Social Index™, social media is how consumers keep up with trends and cultural moments. Brands who understand their consumers and their behaviors on social media thrive and create authentic connections.\n\nAs we reviewed Optimal Send Times data for each social network, we consistently noticed the highest engagement times are between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. Midmornings through very early afternoons proved to be successful posting times across most social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok and X. YouTube and Pinterest saw higher engagement predominantly in the early afternoons.\n\nThere’s more to posting on social media than this quick stat, though. Remember, each network is unique and sees varying engagement throughout the week and at different times. And when you separate industries on each network, engagement varies even more. So even though 9 a.m. or 10 a.m. on weekdays are generally the best times to post on social, consider other variables before you schedule any posts, such as network, audience, algorithms, content quality and captions.\n\nBest times to post on Facebook\n\nIt’s true: Facebook is still the largest social media network in the world with 3.065 billion monthly active users. And our research has uncovered that 90% of consumers maintain a profile on Facebook. The impact Facebook has on social media for consumers and marketers is still ever present. High engagement periods on Facebook are consistently in the mornings every single day of the week.\n\nOptimal send times for Facebook are Mondays through Sundays starting either at 8 or 9 a.m., with time extending to noon on a handful of days. What does this mean for marketers? Start the morning strong and post content early. Consumers are checking their apps first thing in the morning to engage with your content, making it the best time to schedule posts for target audiences to interact with.\n\nWith a good Facebook marketing strategy, businesses connect with the right audiences, whether it's to share product announcements or announce special deals. Remember, engagement is a combination of how often you post on social media, the content you post and when you post.\n\nBest times to post on Instagram\n\nOur research found that most consumers maintain a Facebook profile, but not too far behind is Instagram at 82% of consumers. Like Facebook, 51% of network consumers use Instagram to keep up with cultural moments and trends. Participating in these conversations and knowing when trends are emerging is important–if your audience is there.\n\nThe best times to post on Instagram are generally Mondays through Thursdays between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. We recommend scheduling Instagram posts these weekdays midmornings for optimal engagement. It’s wise to benchmark these times against your current metrics too.\n\nInstagram has grown a long way since its photo-only days. The app, which has 2 billion monthly active users, is a platform to share images, videos, Reels and live streams, just to name a few creative content types.\n\nTo be successful on Instagram, brands need to balance posting high-quality content, consistently, and engaging and entertaining their audiences. Understanding these foundational efforts can help guide your Instagram marketing strategy.\n\nBest times to post on LinkedIn\n\nUnsurprising for this professional-focused social platform, LinkedIn engagement times are consistent with general business hours. High engagement hours are more concentrated to midday on weekdays. Businesses are more likely to succeed in their LinkedIn marketing during these times when users are more active on the platform.\n\nBecause LinkedIn’s content is centered around professional thought-leadership and growing your network, it makes sense that most people use the app during the week. By midday, there’s buzz on the platform, and the best times to post on LinkedIn for Company Pages are Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays starting at 10 a.m. and extending for one to three hours, respectively. Weekends see light engagement, which is why we encourage new content to be posted during the week.\n\nWhile LinkedIn may have started as a job board and networking platform, it’s evolved into a global professional networking hub. It’s a space for professional storytelling and employee advocacy. Businesses on LinkedIn are finding new ways to generate leads, find co-marketing partners, highlight company culture and attract talent, so it makes sense that posting and engagement match with the business hours. Understanding how to reach a wider audience through thoughtful content planning, scheduling and advocacy differentiates your LinkedIn strategy from the next business.\n\nBest times to post on Pinterest\n\nMany users view Pinterest as the visual search engine where users go to research products and discover DIY projects. It also presents an opportunity to expand your reach and create brand awareness. While it might not make sense for all brands to be on the platform, those who use it know Pinterest’s benefits to business goals.\n\nEach year we’re seeing a significant shift in engagement hours this year compared to the year before. Last year, we saw a uniquely high engagement time during the very early hours of the day. Now, we’re seeing high Pinterest engagement hit mid-day across every day of the week. Conclusively, the best times to post on Pinterest are 1 p.m. on any given day of the week. Weekdays see higher engagement times than weekends.\n\nIt may be a combination of when users are searching for inspiration and the Pinterest algorithm that affects engagement times. That shouldn’t stop you from creating a social media calendar with posts scheduled at those hours.\n\nBest Times to Post on TikTok\n\nBeyond viral trends, TikTok's advanced algorithms and precise targeting capabilities have made it an indispensable platform for data-driven marketers. With over 2.65 billion monthly visits globally, understanding optimal posting times on TikTok is essential for maximizing reach for any brand on the app.\n\nThe best times to post on TikTok are Wednesdays between 2 and 5 p.m., as those hours experience higher engagement than the rest of the week. Our data suggests that posting Mondays through Thursdays beginning at noon through 5 p.m. also sees above-average engagement on the app.\n\nWith TikTok trends changing quickly, it’s important to understand trend lifecycles and how they influence consumer behavior and expectations. Once you understand how trends evolve and how consumers use the network to keep up with cultural moments, you can create a proactive TikTok strategy rather than participate reactively.\n\nBest Times to Post on X (Twitter)\n\nX (formerly known as Twitter) has consistently been the platform for up-to-the-minute conversations and breaking news. While some businesses may have shifted their social strategies around X to better align with their brand values, that hasn’t stopped conversations or engagement on the app. Our research has found that 50% of network consumers have a profile on X.\n\nX peak times for engagement match similarly to last year, with hours extending into the weekday afternoons and early evenings. The best times to post on X (Twitter) are Tuesdays through Thursdays from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.\n\nThis engagement on X could reflect an interest in developing news as the day unfolds. There were also several global events that kept users engaged on the app last year, including the recent U.S. Presidential Election. Brands also use X as part of their customer service strategy, as an alternative to traditional customer support options.\n\nBest Times to Post on YouTube\n\nFor marketers using YouTube, consistent scheduling is key to maximizing audience reach and engagement. Understanding optimal posting times can significantly impact video performance.\n\nOur data suggests that the best time to post on YouTube is consistently 1 p.m. on any given day of the week. Thursdays on YouTube have two high-engagement hours at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m., which suggests more flexibility.\n\nWhile consistency is valued throughout the week, it's worth noting that engagement tends to be strongest from Mondays through Fridays. Saturdays and Sundays tend to see lower engagement periods than the rest of the week, due to shifts in viewer behavior and weekend activities. Maintaining a regular YouTube posting schedule, particularly during high-engagement hours, can help you build a loyal audience and maximize video reach.\n\nHow to find your own best times to post on social media\n\nSocial marketers can plan content more effectively when they’re armed with data. As social media continues to evolve, brands and consumers will need to evolve with it. Staying aware of new content formats and trends might help you reach your audience in unexpected ways and build more authentic connections.\n\nYou may be ready to post content at these provided best engagement times as part of your strategy, but consider pairing this data with your own social media data analysis. You may discover that your specific target audience is active near the peak times we’ve outlined or slightly different hours. Remember industry, network and audience as major factors.\n\nA social media management tool like Sprout Social can help you drill into your analytics and develop tailored findings for your brand accounts across all networks, holistically and individually. Gain competitive insights by comparing your performance to your competitors, to find new opportunities for engagement.\n\nHow to find your own best times to post with Sprout Social\n\nSprout’s patented ViralPost® technology uses the same data we used to look at all our customer accounts to find the best time to post, based on your account.

That’s why we want to be clear about the data we pulled and how we got here.\n\nSprout Social’s Data Science team gathers this information by analyzing nearly 2.5 billion engagements across 600,000 social profiles across Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest, TikTok and YouTube. We synthesize this information in collaboration with our Data Science team to provide you with this article.\n\nUnfortunately, we don’t have engagement data for Threads, yet.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nData from Sprout Social include users from various plan types, industries and locations. All times are recorded globally (not by US Central Time). This means you should be able to publish with the times provided in any time zone and see positive engagement results. Number of engagements represents total engagements a brand received on the specific channel during that hour time frame. Industry-specific data includes mid- to high-level engagement times. We recommend testing with your own accounts to find the most optimal send times.\n\nTake the guesswork out of posting times with Sprout\n\nThe best times to post on social media vary by platform and industry, but generally, Mondays through Thursdays between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. on weekdays see the highest engagement. Each network sees different levels of engagement throughout the week and at different times. This all depends on the target audiences or demographic using each network. When you separate industries on each network, engagement varies even more.",

There are a few exceptions though.\n\nWe post on certain holidays (relevant to our organizations) and we always post those early in the morning - and they always perform great, no matter if the suggested time on that day is later.\n\nWhen launching a new account, I wouldn’t pay much attention to the suggestions, because there are not enough followers/engagements to really have that insight.\n\nIf you boost the content after it’s published and you’re targeting the right audience, the times aren’t as important.\n\nGreat question, ​@Marlina Yates!\n\nThe same as ​@judith.edwards mentioned, if it’s a holiday or special event, posting early in the morning is usually the best and what drives the most engagement for us.\n\nFor other posts, I recommend using the suggested times as a starting point, but it’s important to test and find what works best for your audience. Try posting similar content at different times—morning, afternoon, and late afternoon—and track the engagement to see what resonates most.\n\nThis approach not only helps you make informed decisions but also gives you a data-driven answer if your supervisor or leadership asks about your posting strategy.\n\nHope that helps!\n\nOverall, it seems to work for us. There are a few exceptions though.\n\nWe post on certain holidays (relevant to our organizations) and we always post those early in the morning - and they always perform great, no matter if the suggested time on that day is later.\n\nWhen launching a new account, I wouldn’t pay much attention to the suggestions, because there are not enough followers/engagements to really have that insight.\n\nIf you boost the content after it’s published and you’re targeting the right audience, the times aren’t as important.\n\nGreat advice, Judith. This is what I have found and also do the same thing on holidays and those always have great engagement.\n\nI have found that it has been pretty accurate yes.\n\nFor me I do feel like Sprout’s recommended best times is pretty accurate. I have tested out posting a couple of our posts at the most active times that the platform I am posting to suggests as well, but found that Sprout’s best times were more successful when comparing engagements.\n\nOverall, I find the suggested posting times to be relevant for our audience engagement. However, I agree with previous commenters that once you start boosting, the timing becomes less critical.\n\nIn my experience as the manager of a Global Social Team for a large B2B SaaS brand based in the U.S. with locations all over Europe, APAC, and India - you know the best times of day to release content based on the engagement that you see coming in the door. No tool - even something that uses AI, etc. is better than your eyes in terms of really seeing what’s working.\n\nIf you have regions - partner with the Social team members/agency who does Social for that region to determine the best time of day for the release of posts - for example, 8:30 a.m. ET works well for us in the United States, but 6 a.m. ET works well for our European content. We stick to IST best times to post for our India LinkedIn page.\n\nWe’ve been experimenting with this tool since switching to Sprout a few months ago, and I think it helps, but ultimately it is not nearly as powerful or effective as posting content that provides value and catches your audience’s attention. If we post a reel on a topic we know resonates with our audience, I’ve noticed that regardless of what time it’s posted, it gets traction over time and out performs content that may have been posted at an optimal time but isn’t as valuable to viewers. For context though, we are not a global or national brand, so we don’t have to consider optimal times outside of our time zone.",

By their nature, these statements are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, including factors beyond our control, that could cause actual results, performance or achievement to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. These assumptions, uncertainties and risks include that, among others: we may not be able to sustain our revenue and customer growth rate in the future; price increases have and may continue to negatively impact demand for our products, customer acquisition and retention and reduce the total number of customers or customer additions; our business would be harmed by any significant interruptions, delays or outages in services from our platform, our API providers, or certain social media platforms; if we are unable to attract potential customers through unpaid channels, convert this traffic to free trials or convert free trials to paid subscriptions, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected; we may be unable to successfully enter new markets, manage our international expansion and comply with any applicable international laws and regulations; we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses or technologies successfully or achieve the expected benefits of such acquisitions and investments; unstable market and economic conditions, such as recession risks, effects of inflation, labor shortages, supply chain issues, high interest rates, and the impacts of current and potential future bank failures and impacts of ongoing overseas conflicts, could adversely impact our business and that of our existing and prospective customers, which may result in reduced demand for our products; we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness; covenants in our credit agreement may restrict our operations, and if we do not effectively manage our business to comply with these covenants, our financial condition could be adversely impacted; any cybersecurity-related attack, significant data breach or disruption of the information technology systems or networks on which we rely could negatively affect our business; and changing regulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we collect and use personal information and harm our brand.

However, not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. These statements may relate to our market size and growth strategy, our estimated and projected costs, margins, revenue, expenditures and customer and financial growth rates, our Q1 2025 and full year 2025 financial outlook, our plans and objectives for future operations, growth, initiatives or strategies. By their nature, these statements are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, including factors beyond our control, that could cause actual results, performance or achievement to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. These assumptions, uncertainties and risks include that, among others: we may not be able to sustain our revenue and customer growth rate in the future, including due to risks associated with our strategic focus on enterprise customers; price increases have and may continue to negatively impact demand for our products, customer acquisition and retention and reduce the total number of customers or customer additions; our business would be harmed by any significant interruptions, delays or outages in services from our platform, our API providers, or certain social media platforms; if we are unable to attract potential customers through unpaid channels, convert this traffic to free trials or convert free trials to paid subscriptions, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected; we may be unable to successfully enter new markets, manage our international expansion and comply with any applicable international laws and regulations; we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses or technologies successfully or achieve the expected benefits of such acquisitions and investments; unstable market and economic conditions, such as recession risks, effects of inflation, labor shortages, supply chain issues, high interest rates, and the impacts of current and potential future bank failures and impacts of ongoing overseas conflicts, have and could continue to adversely impact our business and that of our existing and prospective customers, which may result in reduced demand for our products; we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness; covenants in our credit agreement may restrict our operations, and if we do not effectively manage our business to comply with these covenants, our financial condition could be adversely impacted; any cybersecurity-related attack, significant data breach or disruption of the information technology systems or networks on which we rely could negatively affect our business; changing regulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we collect and use personal information and harm our brand; and risks related to ongoing legal proceedings. Additional risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements are included under the caption “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 23, 2024 and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, to be filed with the SEC as well as any future reports that we file with the SEC.

Sprout Social assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made, except as required by law.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nWe have provided in this press release certain financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believes that use of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with other companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of our historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review these reconciliations.\n\nNon-GAAP gross profit. We define non-GAAP gross profit as GAAP gross profit, excluding stock-based compensation expense, amortization expense associated with the acquired developed technology from our acquisition of Tagger Media, Inc. (the “Tagger acquisition”) and restructuring charges. We believe non-GAAP gross profit provides our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as it eliminates the effect of stock-based compensation, amortization expense and restructuring charges which are often unrelated to overall operating performance. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we revised our definition of non-GAAP gross profit to exclude restructuring charges associated with a workforce reorganization, consisting primarily of severance and other personnel-related costs.\n\nNon-GAAP gross margin. We define non-GAAP gross margin as non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of revenue.\n\nNon-GAAP operating income (loss). We define non-GAAP operating income (loss) as GAAP loss from operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses and amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets from the Tagger acquisition, restructuring charges and non-cash gains from lease modifications. We believe non-GAAP operating income (loss) provides our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as it eliminates the effect of stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses, amortization expense, restructuring charges and non-cash gains from lease modifications, which are often unrelated to overall operating performance. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we revised our definition of non-GAAP operating income (loss) to exclude restructuring charges associated with a workforce reorganization, consisting primarily of severance and other personnel-related costs, and non-cash gain related to an office lease modification.\n\nNon-GAAP operating margin. We define non-GAAP operating margin as non-GAAP operating income (loss) as a percentage of revenue.\n\nNon-GAAP net income (loss). We define non-GAAP net income (loss) as GAAP net loss, excluding stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets from the Tagger acquisition, tax expense due to changes in valuation allowances from business acquisitions, restructuring charges and non-cash gains from lease modifications. We believe non-GAAP net income (loss) provides our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as this non-GAAP financial measure eliminates the effect of stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses, amortization expense and tax expense due to changes in valuation allowances from business acquisitions, restructuring charges and non-cash gains from lease modifications, which are often unrelated to overall operating performance. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we revised our definition of non-GAAP net income (loss) to exclude restructuring charges associated with a workforce reorganization, consisting primarily of severance and other personnel-related costs, and non-cash gain related to an office lease modification.\n\nNon-GAAP net income (loss) per share. We define non-GAAP net income (loss) per share as GAAP net loss per share attributable to common shareholders, basic and diluted, excluding stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets from the Tagger acquisition, tax expense due to changes in valuation allowances from business acquisitions, restructuring charges and non-cash gains from lease modifications. We believe non-GAAP net income (loss) per share provides our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as this non-GAAP financial measure eliminates the effect of stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses, amortization expense, tax expense due to changes in valuation allowances from business acquisitions, restructuring charges and non-cash gains from lease modifications, which are often unrelated to overall operating performance. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we revised our definition of non-GAAP net income (loss) per share to exclude restructuring charges associated with a workforce reorganization, consisting primarily of severance and other personnel-related costs, and non-cash gain related to an office lease modification.\n\nNon-GAAP free cash flow. We define non-GAAP free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less expenditures for property and equipment, acquisition-related costs, interest and payments related to restructuring charges. Non-GAAP free cash flow does not reflect our future contractual obligations or represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for a given period. We believe non-GAAP free cash flow is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides information to management and investors about the amount of cash used in our core operations that, after expenditures for property and equipment, acquisition-related costs, interest and payments related to restructuring charges, is not available for strategic initiatives. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we revised our definition of non-GAAP free cash flow to exclude payments related to restructuring charges associated with a workforce reorganization.\n\nNon-GAAP free cash flow margin. We define non-GAAP free cash flow margin as non-GAAP free cash flow as a percentage of revenue.\n\nNon-GAAP sales and marketing expenses, non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP general and administrative expenses. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses, non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP general and administrative expenses are defined as sales and marketing expenses, research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses, respectively, less stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, restructuring charges and non-cash gains from lease modifications. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide our management and investors with insight into day-to-day operating expenses given that these measures eliminate the effect of stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses, restructuring charges and non-cash gains from lease modifications. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we revised our definition of non-GAAP general and administrative expenses to exclude restructuring charges associated with a workforce reorganization, consisting primarily of severance and other personnel-related costs, and non-cash gain related to an office lease modification.\n\nKey Business Metrics\n\nRemaining performance obligations (“RPO”). RPO, or remaining performance obligations, represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, and includes deferred revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized in future periods.\n\nCurrent remaining performance obligations (“cRPO”). cRPO, or current RPO, represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, and includes deferred revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized in the next 12 months.\n\nNumber of customers contributing more than $10,000 in ARR. We define number of customers contributing more than $10,000 in ARR as those on a paid subscription plan that had more than $10,000 in ARR as of a period end. We view the number of customers that contribute more than $10,000 in ARR as a measure of our ability to scale with our customers and attract larger organizations. We believe this represents potential for future growth, including expanding within our current customer base.\n\nNumber of customers contributing more than $50,000 in ARR. We define number of customers contributing more than $50,000 in ARR as those on a paid subscription plan that had more than $50,000 in ARR as of a period end. We view the number of customers that contribute more than $50,000 in ARR as a measure of our ability to scale with large customers and attract sophisticated organizations. We believe this represents potential for future growth, including expanding within our current customer base.\n\nDollar-based net retention rate. We calculate dollar-based net retention rate by dividing the ARR from our customers as of December 31st in the reported year by the ARR from those same customers as of December 31st in the previous year. This calculation is net of upsells, contraction, cancellation or expansion during the period but excludes ARR from new customers. We use dollar-based net retention to evaluate the long-term value of our customer relationships, because we believe this metric reflects our ability to retain and expand subscription revenue generated from our existing customers.\n\nDollar-based net retention rate excluding SMB customers. We calculate dollar-based net retention rate excluding SMB customers by dividing the ARR from all customers excluding ARR from customers that we have identified or that self-identified as having less than 50 employees as of December 31st in the reported year by the ARR from those same customers as of December 31st of the previous year. This calculation is net of upsells, contraction, cancellation or expansion during the period but excludes ARR from new customers. We used dollar-based net retention excluding SMB customers to evaluate the long-term value of our larger customer relationships, because we believe this metric reflects our ability to retain and expand subscription revenue generated from our existing customers.\n\nWhile we no longer believe that ARR and number of customers are key performance indicators of Sprout Social’s business, these metrics are necessary for an understanding of how we define number of customers contributing over $10,000 in ARR and number of customers contributing over $50,000 in ARR. For this purpose, we define ARR as the annualized revenue run-rate of subscription agreements from all customers as of the last date of the specified period and we define a customer as a unique account, multiple accounts containing a common non-personal email domain, or multiple accounts governed by a single agreement or entity.\n\nAvailability of Information on Sprout Social’s Website and Social Media Profiles\n\nInvestors and others should note that Sprout Social routinely announces material information to investors and the marketplace using SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, webcasts and the Sprout Social Investors website.
