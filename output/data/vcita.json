It’s almost useless unless you do it on a computer. The invoices cannot take deposits or partial payments which means you cannot use the converted estimate as an invoice if you accept a partial payment. Then you have to create a new invoice. Customer service (live) isn’t all that easy to reach either. The client  ecard is great and the ability to create tags and categories is nice. The rest just needs work.

      "# A must have tool for small businesses!, 5 stars [(SteveM11209, Apple App Store, 2020-10-13)](https://apple/6531209690)\nTo grow a small business you have to have time to work on the business instead of in it, vCita makes it much easier to handle daily tasks so you can focus on growing your business. I know, because I have built a few businesses from the ground up and vCita has been my go to tool for a long time. \n\nIs it perfect, no, but from experience I can say that no tool is. What makes this product shine is the ease of use, for you the owner and for clients. It’s also extremely flexible with the ability to customize everything. With a little help from a seasoned pro, this tool can do anything from scheduling, reminders, payments and my favorite is the ability to integrate with Zapier - that’s when the real fun starts since you can share information between vCita and apps like QuickBooks, ship-station and so on. Ohh, the client portal is a sweet new bonus feature! \n\nvCita is well worth the expense, in my professional opinion. \n\nThank you. \n\nSteve Madar - CEO\n@ Get Better Clicks\nAds | Automation | Consultations",

A booking requires payment before the booking goes through, and I only accept payments through PayPal.\n\nA client booked a consultation and then immediately sent me a message saying they wanted to cancel.  I refunded their payment.\n\nThey have since kept contacting me saying they didn't receive the refund.  I sent them a screenshot from PayPal showing the refund.  The person contacting me is identifying themselves as an \"Administrator\" and is someone different than the person who booked the call.\n\nThey said they paid through Venmo--I'm not even sure if that's possible with Vcita and/or PayPal, but whatever, on my end it's a PayPal payment and I refunded it, so I'm done.\n\nThere is absolutely zero chance that I send them money any other way, so their scam won't succeed.\n\nBut it seems like about the stupidest scam ever.  They actually sent me money through PayPal--I don't think there's a way for them to book without sending me money.  So the scam would have the risk that some people don't refund their original payment.\n\nThis is my first one of these in about 6 years of booking consultations this way.\n\nThoughts?\n\n## Comment ID ijmxllo with +19 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-08-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/taxpros/comments/wkbna1/weird_potential_scam/ijmxllo/) (in reply to ID wkbna1):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID ijmzwqr with +8 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-08-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/taxpros/comments/wkbna1/weird_potential_scam/ijmzwqr/) (in reply to ID ijmxllo):\n>They probably paid with stolen PayPal credentials or with a stolen credit card via PayPal.\n\nAh, makes sense, that explains it.\n\n## Comment ID ijohjuh with +2 score by [(attosec, Reddit, 2022-08-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/taxpros/comments/wkbna1/weird_potential_scam/ijohjuh/) (in reply to ID wkbna1):\nYou wrote “I refunded their payment”.

Drake: This was originally my first choice. Lowest cost at $1,970 for unlimited returns.\n2. ProConnect: Some experience with it based on graduate class tax return projects. The integration with QBO is a plus. I would buy 10 1040's and 10 others at a cost of $1,157 and then PPR if I scale up.\n3. Ultratax: I have experience with Onesource based on my industry job (I know it's a different software but I'm hoping there are some similarities between the two). 100 total returns (up to 25 business) with 10 unique states for $2,785\n\nThis would be something I do on the side (my new job is non-accounting related and have 3-4 days off a week). I'm not expecting more than 10 clients my first year as I test the waters. If the client's require bookkeeping, I would want to do that as well so I have more control over the overall product. I don't think this will ever replace my full-time job because I really enjoy my current gig but I do see myself investing about 20-25 hours a week into it.\n\nI wouldn't say cost is no object but it's not the biggest factor in my decision. I'm looking for something that I could grow with in case this is something that really take's off and starts to question my current FT job.\n\nI'm based in NV but expect some CA clients.\n\nI'm leaning towards ProConnect based on the scalability and integrations with QBO but wanted to hear other's thoughts on what they would do if they were in my position. Ideally looking for individuals who currently use Drake, started with Drake and then moved to something else, or just jumped straight into ProConnect or Ultratax.\n\nThank you all in advance!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Comment ID jr2ri74 with +7 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-07-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/taxpros/comments/14tibgs/narrowing_down_tax_software/jr2ri74/) (in reply to ID 14tibgs):\nIf your clients are simple then Drake or Proconnect would work.

I started with the PPR package & bought additional returns as I needed. Eventually: once the cost of that surpassed the all-inclusive Unlimited package, I switched so that my volume wouldn’t be limited. Drake’s customer service is unmatched, even after they were acquired by a private equity company.

It's super easy to set up and integrate into an existing site (just add a link). The benefit over other booking systems is it integrates with payments out of the box and supports cancellation fees. When a customer books via the flow, you can require them to put down a 50 cent credit card hold and it saves their card on Stripe so you can charge a cancellation fee later.\n\nSo it's perfect for service businesses such as auto detail or hair salons that don't want random people to occupy booking slots and not show up. There are also some demo stores with fake data you can get to from the landing page if you want to check it out.\n\n* Optionally save payment information during bookings and charge cancellation fees for no-shows later on\n* Very easy integration into your website - no coding required\n* Send email and SMS appointment confirmations/reminders\n* Multiple Calendar/service customizations and reservation booking flow for customers. Opening hours, vacation days, open/closed days, etc.\n* Has a dashboard, CRM features, and can manage customers through it and process payments too",

But with a $300 price tag it seems very very high, when I can use a lawn care crm for free and then outsource the rest. I just like the all in one set up of thryv.

The price looks high on paper but if you hire a SEO/Marketing firm, you're likely to pay a lot more in a monthly retainer. So you're likely to get a standard service like managing your Google My Business listing, which they'll do with equal care for anyone else on their platform including your competitors.\n\nYou can get CRM functionality for way less than $300 so the real question is whether the marketing features pay for themselves or not.

Moreover, they are unwilling to waive the next month's optimization fee and subscription fee, even though they have not carried out any activity or optimization for my business.

You have a nice website, a good GMB presence, good customer service, and make it as easy as possible for customers to give you their information and contact you.\n\n>Essentially that's all there is to it. You make a \"funnel\" where it's fast and easy for customers to give you their information, and then you drive traffic to the funnel. Whether or not that's through Facebook ads, SEO, or flyers, the premise is the same.\n\n>I follow the /r/marketing subreddit to stay up to date with industry changes, and I'm a regular at various conferences, they're webinars in this covid world.

And those types of leads are a lot easier to close because you’ve been referred. But a business should not rely on just word of mouth only. The most valuable business that build value and make it easy to sell have a proven lead generating strategy. A business that has a website and other digital assets that has a consistent flow of leads through multiple lead streams will sell for a lot more money than one that just relies on word of mouth. We also help businesses build value and prepare owners that might one day pass on the business to children, their employees or sell out to retire. \nOwners that pass their business to children or employees often find themselves financing part of the business by taking a portion of the business’s profits every year.

My business google page: Get reviews from all your customers. This builds up over time. \n2. Add images and posts to my google business page. It helps with SEO.\n3. Have a Facebook page for your business.\n4. Get active in local Facebook groups. Make a generic poster for the kind of services you provide along with contact information. Post it bi-weekly in all the local Facebook groups.\n5. If you have a budget, Get a website and do local SEO. I would strongly advise, using voice searches term. Also, If there is any other language your core customers use, consider SEO of those terms as well. \n6. If you have a budget, Run Facebook ads and google ads. High-quality leads can come from there.\n\nThat is on top of my mind. You can do in more details with a specific niche. \n\nTrust this helps.

Then focus on building a following. \n\nGet word of mouth referrals from FB, NextDoor, Insta, etc. Capture emails and just making quality regular posts or a giveaway that show community involvement are like gold, locals don't forget and when a need for the service arrives someone \"knows a guy\". Ad costs go down as you grow your email lists and following.\n\nMovers should ensure accurate google listing so you show up on a search with a pin on a map. Get in some lists from big companies that rank on first page results like uhaul and angies list, etc pay the fee to get listed. Make an offer to put on your ad, like \"use this coupon code to recieve 10% off for our Fall Moving Special\". Or free ____ if you book now (not sure about movers, so maybe cost of boxes, storage, packing material etc).\n\nIf you have a local page that advertises and ranks on google the service you provide, put an ad in with them. Or get one made using important keywords for example \"best ft. Lauderdale movers dot com or affordable east tennesee movers .net\" put your biz at the top on that and do SEO. \n\nNow someone types best mover in ft lauderdale into google, low and behold that hot lead sees your site,  your funnels, your social proof, and a 10% off coupon?

But mostly I use my content feed to tease projects and create content for my clients to use to build their respective client bases, benefitting me in the long run. \n\nFor example, I posted some detail shots of a project I’m about to complete, tagged the materials vendor and my client. My client was able to share the pics with her client as a fun status update, and I received 2 inquiries off her feed from other designers I’ve been wanting to work with for years. On another pic of a recently completed project, I had 3-4 of my client’s clients engage with the post, which in turn gave my clients the opportunity to sell this particular type of project to the end user that they otherwise wouldn’t have had. Other posts are used to educate the consumer base: time lapse videos of construction, demos of the equipment we use to make our products, etc. Consumers are very uneducated about custom manufacturing, so putting a human face and demonstrating the time and labor it takes to make our products goes a long way to minimize the sticker shock of our quotes. \n\nI know I’m approaching social media in a very strange way, but I gotta say it’s working for me.\n\n### Comment ID kgz6987 with +1 score by [(Local-Growth-Experts, Reddit, 2024-01-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/jicl2v/how_does_a_local_service_business_generate_leads/kgz6987/) (in reply to ID ga63exn):\nWhat type of business?

It's far too 'culty' for me.  The demand for X referrals or you slip down the weekly published leader board never sat well.\n\nWhen they took me into a separate side room after my second trial breakfast with them to ask about my intentions, I thought they were about to start handing out robes and requiring a blood sacrifice.  \n\nThe two guys that took me aside were apparently sales coaches, but clearly not good ones.  They used the most obvious hard pressure tactics in the book, the sort that no actually successful business has used since the 90s.  Looking into their backgrounds and client lists (publicly available via their shitty websites that hadn't been updated in 10 years), they were average salesmen at best during their careers and now strongarm businesses in dying industries run by fucking idiots into buying their \"5/7/9/15 step programme to sales success\" \n\nI was a member for about 6 months but refused to turn up again after one local business owner kept getting shit for not referring enough businesses, despite using another BNI member to build a £600k oak framed building.  Yes, it was one referral, but it eclipsed the other referral values combined for the rest of the year.  Apparently, that didn't matter.\n\nI actually lost a client over it (he was one of the grandmasters or whatever they call themselves), but the time I gained by not coming up with bullshit referrals and pushing people I shouldn't into rubbish meetings more than made up for the loss.

What words do they use to describe that problem? What questions are they asking about that problem? \n\nWhere are they looking for info on solving that problem? \n\nGenerically, you'll need to have a web presence so people searching for your kind of services can find you. Google my business is free and easy. Facebook is too. Websites cost a couple hundred bucks these days. Yelp is fucking bullshit. \n\nPaid search works if you know how to work it. There's a lot of PPC snake oil salesmen out there but also good ones and there's a bunch of articles on how to tell the difference. I'd have an expert do it rather than try it and not perform well. \n\nMany service companies will partner with lead generation companies: they're great at getting phone calls that they can pass to you but aren't electricians or whatever. It's nice to use them because it's one less thing you need to worry about but they do take a piece of the pie and you don't have as much control over how you're presented or what calls you get, and have no opportunity to build a brand. \n\nThere's other methods that work. If you work on their property and do work that is visible, see if you can put up $10 yards signs so their neighbors can call you. Someone gave out $500 in lotto scratchers and got $14,000 in work from it. I gave out $50 gift cards to people that referred clients and got 2-3 more usually. \n\nMost importantly though: whenever you get a new customer ask them 1) how did you hear about us 2) what made you choose us. Your strongest marketing channels and value proposition are going to be things that you discover, not that you create.\n\n## Comment ID l9yh6of with +1 score by [(CreatorCrux, Reddit, 2024-06-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/jicl2v/how_does_a_local_service_business_generate_leads/l9yh6of/) (in reply to ID jicl2v):\nGenerating leads for a local service business in the digital space can greatly complement word-of-mouth referrals.

Google My Business (GMB)\n\n* **Set Up and Optimize**: Make sure your GMB profile is fully set up with all your business details, operating hours, and high-quality photos.\n* **Regular Updates**: Post updates, photos, and special offers regularly to keep your profile active.\n* **Encourage Reviews**: Ask satisfied customers to leave positive reviews, which can significantly boost your visibility and credibility.\n\n# 2. Local SEO\n\n* **Optimize Your Website**: Make sure your website is optimized for local searches. Include local keywords and create content around them.\n* **Create Location-Specific Pages**: If you serve multiple areas, create dedicated pages for each location with relevant keywords.\n* **Backlinks**: Get listed on local directories and engage in local community activities to earn backlinks.\n\n# 3. Social Media\n\n* **Engage with the Community**: Join local groups on Facebook, Nextdoor, and other platforms to engage with potential customers.\n* **Share Valuable Content**: Post regularly about your services, share tips related to your industry, and showcase customer testimonials.\n* **Run Local Ads**: Facebook and Instagram ads targeted to your local area can be very effective.\n\n# 4. Content Marketing\n\n* **Blog Posts**: Write blog posts that address common questions and issues related to your services. This can help attract organic traffic.\n* **Videos**: Create videos showcasing your work, customer testimonials, and behind-the-scenes looks at your business.\n\n# 5. Lead Scraping with Google Maps\n\n* **Find Leads**: Use Google Maps to search for businesses \"Near Me\" and collect their details.\n* **Gather Information**: Note down contact numbers, email addresses, and website links.\n* **Analyze and Target**: Identify high-value targets and assess their online presence to see where you can offer value.\n\nIf you'd like to watch a detailed YouTube video on how I scrape leads using Google Maps and other strategies, DM me and I'll send you the link.\n\n## Comment ID lk4zror with +1 score by [(TotalPeachCase, Reddit, 2024-08-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/jicl2v/how_does_a_local_service_business_generate_leads/lk4zror/) (in reply to ID jicl2v):\nwww.market-monster.com helps roofers and contractors… well any service based business.

Like, I need the tile behind by bathroom tub redone because I was scammed by a Craigslist tile guy who got called to another job and got his 'friend' who never did tile before to totally fuck my shit up. I was out of town, and now I have to pay double to get it redone. \n\nSo, how does one overcome the fear people have hiring the 'right person' for the job? \n\nThe thing I want to see is photos of completed jobs that look almost exactly like mine. I want to see even tile, straight lines, nice cut tile that is symmetrical and not chipped, crooked, or janky. Photos that are high quality, but here is the thing. They can't be stock-photo quality, but can't be piss poor flash in the image quality. Also, having a person holding a sign, or a sign in the shot that isn't photoshopped in with the company name on it, means it is most likely real photos. So that shows they are experienced.\n\nThe next thing is, if I am about to spend $1k-$5k, what kind of testimonials are there? Are they fake or real? A real one would have both a negative and a positive, with the negative being not so bad. Fake ones are like those crazy over the top with words like 'perfect' 'amazing' 'wonderful' and stuff that is clearly orgasmic with the verbiage. It sounds like an Amazon review for a Chinese product because it can do everything like cure cancer from having tile put in. Yea, skip that guy. Look for real reviews.\n\nWhat other fears are out there? What does the owner look like? Is there a photo of him? Does he look like Mr. Burns from the Simpsons, or does he look like George Clooney? I feel more trustful from George than Mr. Burns with that shady eye evil grin. I also want to speak to the owner and get at least a verbal guarantee that the job will be done right and not half assed. \n\nLastly, and this is a big one: respect of my home, and clean up. Will they wear booties? Will they be gentile in my open areas with tools and not scuff my hall walls coming down it with a bucket of grout? Will they wear booties, and not stink like booze? Are their hoodies clean or are they pit-stained like they came from a homeless shelter? \n\nI think when you market ANY service, you have to overcome the fears that people have and their objections and also sound at least, reasonable. Most of us don't mind paying a 'fair price' for a 'good job' but when you have the 'new guy' doing your job wrong, the owner has two choices: fix it, or lie and scam. So making sure your advertising is reflective of overcoming 'no' and the fears, means your campaign is going to hit better when it lands in my inbox or in a flyer.\n\n## Comment ID ga9a1nu with +1 score by [(mrmetis, Reddit, 2020-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/jicl2v/how_does_a_local_service_business_generate_leads/ga9a1nu/) (in reply to ID jicl2v):\nit has variations but we can say inbound and outbound. I suggest inbound where customers look for you. so you create local address included content related to your products, where people can continue asking or researching your service. in there they will be giving out their information from your landing page. \n\n\n\nafter they become leads you can categorize them waiting, contacted once, rejected, agreed etc. cold calls email but critical virtue is ''follow up''. if you pay for ads it can help but it should be designed different.\n\n\n\nI would also suggest creating a blog for long term exposure and creating an ''authority image'' in the industry but since I dont know what you exactly do, I dont know if this is a good option for you.\n\n\ngood luck.\n\n## Comment ID ga9ynsg with +1 score by [(Unemployed20, Reddit, 2020-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/jicl2v/how_does_a_local_service_business_generate_leads/ga9ynsg/) (in reply to ID jicl2v):\nHey man,\n\nWill avoid any woo-woo MLM psychology shit here (ABC, etc.) and will go straight to the nitty gritty of low-cost/highly effective lead gen.\n\nA bit about myself, I run a B2B Lead Gen team and several growth hacking communities across Whatsapp & Facebook.\n\nSo we will start of with email:\n\nIf you're servicing other businesses (hence B2B), you can simply scrape facebook's business page directory ([www.facebook.com/pages/category](http://www.facebook(.)com/pages/category)) for the exact business category you're scraping and go further down by location.\n\nI show how to do this right here: [https://youtu.be/KxF7yWDoqvM](https://youtu.be/KxF7yWDoqvM)\n\nLinkedin:\n\nLinkedin can also serve as an awesome B2B lead generation channel, especially locally, considering that you're able to run a search based on exact location & industry. This works best for white-collar businesses but can also yield results for the lesser complex service lines.\n\nFacebook:\n\nFor the B2C aspect of things, hence, finding houses to paint, cars to fix, etc. I'd strongly recommend Facebook or Instagram Ads. Test with small budgets and then double down budget wise on the ad sets that work best. Make sure to use Facebook's Ad Library to actually spy on your competition and get a good idea on which ads are performing well and which ads are not. Use Facebook to reach an older demographic, and use Instagram to reach your location's younger demographic.\n\nAdditionally note that from a B2B perspective, you can also scrape local small business owner groups within your region, save the profile URLs and then use a tool like Texau to outreach to 30 of them automatically per day. (More grey hat but super do-able)\n\nContent:\n\nSEO is super competitive, especially with keywords like \"Plumber near me\" or \"Mechanic near me\", but Youtube's SEO is much much more easier to dominate. This is exactly why I always recommend that \"long-sighted\" businesses actually take the time to create service-related content as it can drastically improve your deal flow in the long run. Much less of an upfront $$$ investment, but more of a time investment with crazy results.\n\nHope this helped.\n\nThose are my ideas from the top of my head, without looking at your site/url.\n\nIf you have more questions, DM.\n\n## Comment ID k8z6vjv with +1 score by [(Proof_Title116, Reddit, 2023-11-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/jicl2v/how_does_a_local_service_business_generate_leads/k8z6vjv/) (in reply to ID jicl2v):\nVery old thread, but I wanted to chime in on the topic. \n\nYou would not believe how many established companies don’t market to their email lists. \n\nNo matter what business you’re in - physical location, web-based, service, B2B/c - your email list should be top of mind and integrated properly into every single marketing effort (ppc, mailers, tv, web and print).\n\nI be happy to answer questions (if there are any) related to email marketing.\n\n## Comment ID kcypl8v with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-12-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/jicl2v/how_does_a_local_service_business_generate_leads/kcypl8v/) (in reply to ID jicl2v):\nRelevant? https://101databroker.com/generating-leads-for-small-businesses/\n\n## Comment ID kgz4i75 with +1 score by [(Local-Growth-Experts, Reddit, 2024-01-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/jicl2v/how_does_a_local_service_business_generate_leads/kgz4i75/) (in reply to ID jicl2v):\nThe most successful way to get local leads as a small local business is first get a website. It’s important when building a website that it’s built with getting local traffic in mind. Then build a GOOGLE Business Profile, and have it optimized for attracting local customers as well. Be sure to include optimized images in your website as well. It’s very important to make sure all of your business information NAP (Name, Address & Phone) are exactly the same as well as your hours of operation on both your GBP and your website. \n\nGoogle likes consistent information. Having the same information also builds trust and GOOGLE rewards websites it considers trustworthy. You should then Build citations (other mini type profiles that mainly consist of your NAP, brief description of your business and a few photos as well as your hours of business. \n\nThis and some other strategies can get even a new website to rank on the first page of Google within 30-90 days depending on location, niche (business type) and competition. Once your on the first page of Google other strategies are employed to maintain the position. There are only 10 organic spots available on a Google page. Statistics from a recent poll say that the first page of Google gets 87-95% of all website clicks for any given niche in any particular location. The second page drops drastically to less than 6%. So as the old saying goes…if you’re not First your last & this truly applies to being on google. \nOr you can also run Google campaigns for paid ads, facebook and instagram advertising. But when running paid advertising campaigns these should be well thought out campaigns as well. GOOD campaigns not only get you a ton of local business leads but the better your campaigns the cheaper your ad spend. \nA business should have a good strategy for getting a consistent flow of quality local leads in order to stay busy and grow its business. Stay away from lead generation sites that sell leads to multiple business at the same time. These leads are typically a waste of time and can really eat into profits. \nReach out for more local lead getting strategies!\nHope this helps some local small businesses!"

The scheduler is connected to my personal calendar which allows me to work when / how I want to and live, too! I've been a customer for over two years and I will not leave. There are bells and whistles I still haven't tapped into and the customer service is great. I've only needed help with customer service once and it was resolved quickly.  The app is easy to manage, customize, and integrate with social media and my payment system. I absolutely love the appointment reminders my clients receive and how easy it is for them to reschedule. vCITA solves a huge administrative problem for me and keeps me sane as I juggle all of my roles and workload while providing excellent care to my clients.",

I know, because I have built a few businesses from the ground up and vCita has been my go to tool for a long time. \n\nIs it perfect, no, but from experience I can say that no tool is. What makes this product shine is the ease of use, for you the owner and for clients. It’s also extremely flexible with the ability to customize everything. With a little help from a seasoned pro, this tool can do anything from scheduling, reminders, payments and my favorite is the ability to integrate with Zapier - that’s when the real fun starts since you can share information between vCita and apps like QuickBooks, ship-station and so on. Ohh, the client portal is a sweet new bonus feature! \n\nvCita is well worth the expense, in my professional opinion. \n\nThank you. \n\nSteve Madar - CEO\n@ Get Better Clicks\nAds | Automation | Consultations",

The invoices cannot take deposits or partial payments which means you cannot use the converted estimate as an invoice if you accept a partial payment. Then you have to create a new invoice. Customer service (live) isn’t all that easy to reach either. The client  ecard is great and the ability to create tags and categories is nice. The rest just needs work.

      "# [Popular payment methods for small business owners by Bryan Simmons, Content on 2024-09-16](https://www.vcita.com/blog/payments/payment-methods-for-small-business)\nYou’re a small business owner looking to get paid quickly and without fuss. You want to make it as easy as possible for your customers to pay you, and keep payment fees to a minimum. But which payment methods should you offer, and how can you stop processing fees from mounting up?\n\nThe good news is that there are plenty of options. Accepting credit cards used to mean a clunky merchant account and heavy transaction fees, but not anymore. Mobile payments, online payment gateways, and popular third-party processors now offer small business owners like you affordable payment solutions to accept credit cards and manage cash flow.\n\nThis overview of payment options helps you make smart decisions about receiving payments and avoiding excessive transaction fees.\n\nAccepting credit and debit cards for your small business\n\nThe key benefits\n\nOffering credit and debit card payments is a must for small businesses today. Not only does it provide convenience for customers, but it can also boost your cash flow and increase sales. With mobile payment solutions and online payment gateways, accepting popular payment methods like credit cards has never been easier.\n\nGetting set up\n\nTo start accepting credit and debit cards, you’ll need a merchant account from a bank or payment processor. This allows you to receive electronic funds from customer’s bank accounts when they pay with cards. You’ll also need a payment gateway – software that securely transmits card data between you, the customer, and your merchant account provider. Many providers bundle the merchant account and payment gateway together as an all-in-one credit card processing solution.\n\nChoosing the right option\n\nThere are various ways to actually accept the card payments in person or online. For in-store purchases, you can use a simple card reader that connects to your mobile device or POS system. For ecommerce or invoicing, an online payment method integrated with your website or software is ideal. Popular options include Stripe, Square, PayPal, and services like vcita that bundle it all together. Just watch out for transaction fees that can eat into your profits.\n\nThe payoff\n\nWhile there are some upfront and ongoing costs, the ability to accept credit and debit card payments is worth it. Customers expect the convenience and flexibility of using their preferred type of payment method. Offering it can help you stand out, increase sales from impulse buys, and maintain a healthy cash flow.\n\nSetting up a merchant account and payment gateway\n\nOpen your merchant account\n\nTo accept credit and debit card payments, you’ll need a merchant account. Setting one up is pretty straightforward. You’ll apply to a merchant account provider, sharing details about your business. Once approved, you can start accepting popular payment types like Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover.\n\nChoose an online payment gateway\n\nAn online payment gateway is the virtual terminal that securely processes credit card payments for your business. It encrypts customer’s bank account info and connects with your merchant account to move funds. Many merchant account providers offer their own integrated payment gateways. Or you can opt for third-party solutions like PayPal, Stripe, or Square. They integrate seamlessly with e-commerce platforms and charge around 2.9% + $0.30 per online transaction. Just be sure any gateway you use is PCI compliant to protect customer data.\n\nConsider mobile payments\n\nLots of small business owners now accept mobile payments using smartphone card readers and apps. Solutions like Square, PayPal, and Clover allow you to securely accept chip or contactless payments like Apple Pay on the go.\n\nMind the fees\n\nOf course, all these online payment methods for small businesses come with transaction fees. Merchant account fees can range from a few cents plus a percentage for each sale. Same for mobile payment processors. Factori those credit card processing costs into your pricing to keep cash flow healthy.\n\nMobile and online payment options for small businesses\n\nConvenient payment solutions\n\nThese days, customers expect a seamless payment experience – whether shopping online or in person. As a small business owner, offering mobile and online payment options is crucial. It allows you to meet customer expectations and boost sales.\n\nAccept credit cards on-the-go\n\nA mobile credit card reader turns your smartphone or tablet into a virtual payment terminal. This pocket-sized device lets you accept credit and debit card payments anywhere – at events, markets, or customer locations. Just plug it into your device’s audio jack or connect via Bluetooth.\n\nPopular options like Square, PayPal Here, and Intuit GoPayment make it easy to start accepting plastic on your mobile. The fees are low, with rates around 2.7% per swiped transaction.\n\nStay flexible with virtual terminals\n\nVirtual terminals allow you to manually key in card details and accept payments over the phone, by mail, or in your office. Popular options include PayPal Virtual Terminal, Dharma, and Square Virtual Terminal. The fees are similar to online gateways.\n\nUnified payment solutions\n\nAll-in-one platforms like vcita consolidate mobile payments, online gateways, virtual terminals and more into one easy solution. This provides a centralized way to accept all major payment types – simplifying operations and cash flow tracking.\n\nPCI compliance: what small business owners need to know\n\nPCI compliance is crucial when accepting credit and debit card payments. It helps protect your customers’ sensitive data and builds trust. Failing to comply can lead to hefty fines, lawsuits, and damage to your reputation.\n\nWhat is PCI compliance?\n\nPCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) is a set of security standards for businesses that handle, store or transmit credit card data. It ensures that you have robust measures in place to safeguard cardholder information from theft or misuse.\n\nWhy it matters\n\nData breaches and fraud are on the rise. Customers want assurance their card details are safe with you. Being PCI compliant shows you take security seriously and value their privacy. It can give you an edge over competitors.\n\nKey requirements\n\nThe key compliance areas for PCI include:\n\nUsing PCI-approved payment gateways and card readers\n\nEncrypting transmission of cardholder data\n\nRestricting data access to employees who need it\n\nMaintaining secure systems and applications\n\nRegularly monitoring and testing networks\n\nEnsuring PCI compliance\n\nFor small merchants, PCI compliance starts with your payment processor or gateway provider. They’ll have a program and self-assessment questionnaires tailored to your needs. Work closely with them to implement best practices specific to your business.\n\nThe path to full PCI DSS compliance has some upfront costs. But it’s an investment that pays dividends through increased customer trust and avoiding costly data breaches down the road.\n\nChoosing the right payment processing solutions for your small business needs\n\nOffering the most popular payment methods\n\nAs a small business owner, offering convenient payment options is crucial for keeping your customers happy and your cash flow healthy. You want to make sure to offer the payment methods that your customers prefer.\n\nAccepting credit and debit cards is a must these days, as most customers prefer the convenience of plastic over cash. You’ll need a merchant account and payment gateway to process these transactions. Mobile payments like Apple Pay and Google Pay are also becoming increasingly popular, especially among younger customers.\n\nFinding the right fit\n\nNow that you know the options, it’s time to figure out which ones make sense for your business. Consider factors like the type of goods or services you offer, your average transaction amount, and how often you get paid.\n\nFor example, if you’re a mobile service provider like a plumber or landscaper, a card reader that accepts contactless payments on-the-go could be a game-changer. But if you run an online store, an e-commerce platform with a built-in payment gateway might be a better choice.\n\nKeeping it secure and affordable\n\nOf course, security and affordability are also key concerns. Look for PCI-compliant solutions that protect your customers’ data and don’t nickel-and-dime you with hidden fees. Many providers charge a flat monthly rate plus reasonable transaction fees, which can help you budget better.\n\nTools like vcita’s all-in-one business management software can streamline your payment process while meeting security standards. With options for online payments, invoicing, and accepting credit cards, it’s a versatile solution worth considering.\n\nThe right payment methods can boost sales",

      "# [Time blocking: the secret to productivity by Amy Wilder, Community Manager on 2024-09-30](https://www.vcita.com/blog/time-management/time-blocking)\nEver feel like you’re drowning in a sea of daily tasks? Time blocking might just be your productivity life raft.\n\nThis powerful time management technique helps you tackle important tasks and achieve deep work by creating specific blocks of time for each activity. The benefits of time blocking are huge for small business owners juggling multiple priorities, helping you to boost focus, reduce stress, and accomplish more high-priority work.\n\nLet’s explore how to craft a time blocked schedule that works for you.\n\nWhat is time blocking and why is it important?\n\nTime blocking is a powerful time management technique that can revolutionize your productivity. It’s all about creating specific blocks of time in your schedule for important tasks and deep work. Instead of tackling your to-do list haphazardly, you deliberately plan out your day, assigning each task its own time slot.\n\nThe power of structure\n\nWhen you create time blocks, you’re essentially giving structure to your day. This structure helps you focus on high-priority tasks without getting sidetracked by less important ones. By dedicating specific blocks of time to tasks like responding to emails or working on a project, you’re more likely to stay focused.\n\nBoosting productivity and focus\n\nOne of the key benefits of time blocking is its ability to enhance your productivity. When you know you have a set amount of time for a specific task, you’re more likely to dive in and give it your full attention. This can help you complete tasks faster and lead to higher quality work.\n\nFlexibility and balance\n\nDon’t worry – time blocking isn’t about rigidly sticking to a schedule. You can adjust your time blocks as needed, accounting for unexpected tasks or shifting priorities. And don’t forget to block out time for breaks, lunch, and self-care. A well-balanced time blocked schedule can help you manage your energy levels throughout the day.\n\nThe benefits of time blocking for productivity\n\nBy creating specific blocks of time for your daily tasks, you’ll find yourself accomplishing more than ever before. Let’s dive into why this method is so effective for small business owners like you.\n\nLaser-focused work sessions\n\nWhen you time block your work, you’re giving yourself permission to focus solely on one specific task. This leads to periods of deep work, where you can tackle those high-priority projects without distractions.\n\nImproved task prioritization\n\nCreating a time blocked schedule forces you to prioritize your important tasks. You’ll quickly realize which activities deserve prime spots in your day and which can be batched or delegated. This clarity helps you make the most of your limited time as a busy entrepreneur.\n\nReduced decision fatigue\n\nWith a time-blocked work day, you’ve already decided what to focus on and when. This eliminates the mental energy spent on constantly choosing your next task, leaving you with more brain power for actual work. Plus, you’ll find it easier to say “no” to non-essential interruptions.\n\nBetter work-life balance\n\nBy allocating specific blocks for responding to emails, lunch breaks, and personal time, you’re creating a more balanced day. vcita’s all-in-one small business management software can help you stick to your schedule, ensuring you don’t neglect self-care or family time.\n\nHow to create an effective time-blocked schedule\n\nCreating a time blocked schedule might seem daunting at first, but with a few simple steps, you’ll be on your way to mastering this powerful time management technique. Let’s dive in!\n\nStart with your high-priority tasks\n\nBegin by identifying your most important tasks. These are usually the ones that contribute most to your business goals. Allocate specific blocks of time for these high-priority items when you’re at your most productive. For many small business owners, this might be early in the morning or right after lunch.\n\nIncorporate deep work sessions\n\nSet aside longer blocks for deep work – those tasks that require intense focus and concentration. This might include strategic planning, content creation, or financial analysis. Try to schedule these during times when you’re least likely to be interrupted.\n\nDon’t forget the small stuff\n\nWhile it’s tempting to focus solely on big projects, don’t neglect daily tasks like responding to emails or making quick phone calls. Use task batching to group similar activities together, creating efficient time blocks for these smaller but necessary jobs.\n\nBe realistic and flexible\n\nRemember, the goal is progress, not perfection. Be realistic about how long tasks take and don’t forget to include breaks. Use tools like Google Calendar to easily adjust your time blocks as needed. With practice, you’ll get better at estimating and allocating your time effectively.\n\nTime blocking methods and tools you can use\n\nYou’re on board with time blocking as a powerful time management technique, but how do you actually implement it? Let’s dive into some practical methods and tools to get you started.\n\nDigital tools for time blocking\n\nIn our digital age, your smartphone or computer can be your best friend when it comes to time blocking. Google Calendar is a popular choice, allowing you to create specific blocks of time for each task. You can color-code your blocks, set reminders, and even share your schedule with team members.\n\nFor the tech-savvy small business owner, vcita’s all-in-one business management software can take time blocking to the next level. It not only helps you create time blocks, but also integrates with your other business processes, making it easier to stick to your time blocked schedule.\n\nAnalog methods\n\nIf you prefer a more tactile approach, don’t underestimate the power of pen and paper. A simple notebook or planner can be just as effective for time blocking. Try using different colored pens to categorize your tasks – blue for client work, red for high priority tasks, green for breaks.\n\nCommon mistakes to avoid with time blocking\n\nTime blocking can be a game-changer for your productivity, but it’s easy to fall into some common traps. Let’s explore these pitfalls so you can make the most of this powerful time management technique.\n\nOverestimating your capacity\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes is trying to cram too many tasks into your time blocks. Be realistic about how much you can accomplish in a given period. It’s better to complete fewer tasks thoroughly than to rush through a long list.\n\nNeglecting flexibility\n\nWhile structure is key, rigidity can be your downfall. Life happens, and unexpected tasks pop up. Don’t beat yourself up if you need to adjust your time blocks. The beauty of time blocking is its adaptability, so use it to your advantage.\n\nForgetting to schedule breaks\n\nIn your quest for productivity, don’t forget to pencil in those lunch breaks and moments of rest. Taking regular breathers actually boosts your efficiency during deep work sessions.\n\nIgnoring low-priority tasks\n\nIt’s tempting to focus solely on high-priority items, but don’t let the small stuff pile up. Allocate specific blocks of time for responding to emails or handling administrative tasks.\n\nTime blocking can rejuvenate your productivity\n\nIf you’re struggling to get through your to-do list, time blocking could be your secret key to productivity. By creating specific blocks of time for important tasks, you’ll crush your daily tasks and make room for deep work. Remember, the benefits of time blocking are numerous, but it may take some practice to perfect. Don’t be afraid to adjust your time blocks as you learn what works best for you and your business. You’ll soon reap the benefits of time blocking, boosting your productivity and reducing stress.",

      "# [Identifying customer pain points to improve your business by Laura McArthur, Content on 2024-07-29](https://www.vcita.com/blog/small-business-tips/customer-pain-points)\nYou start every day full of energy, hyped up to serve your customers. But what if you’re not seeing many customers or clients, and your work hours tick by without much to do?\n\nYour potential customers might be experiencing pain points in your business, which put them off from buying your products or booking your services. Identifying these customer pain points can totally change your marketing strategy.\n\nEven if you’re usually busy responding to customers and clients every day, it’s vital for you to review your business for customer pain points that could be holding you back from growth. Read on to learn how to conduct qualitative research to uncover what types of pain your customers face, and what to do to address those paint points.\n\nWhat are customer pain points?\n\nAs a small business owner, the key to growth is identifying your customers’ pain points. These are the problems or frustrations your customers experience with your product or service. Understanding these pains is crucial to improving your business and marketing strategy.\n\nPain points occur when customers struggle with parts of the customer journey that should be seamless. They may face process pain points with inefficient internal processes, support pain points in getting help, or financial pain points regarding pricing or payment.\n\nWhen you reduce pain points, you’ll likely see higher customer satisfaction, increased loyalty, and more referrals. Your staff will be more productive without spending time handling complaints or confusion, and as customers have an easier experience with your company at every touchpoint, your sales numbers should grow over time.\n\nCommon types of customer pain points\n\nConducting qualitative research, like surveys and interviews, helps you understand the types of pains your customers face. There are several types of customer pain points to look out for:\n\nProcess pain points\n\nProcess pain points occur when customers struggle with your internal processes or customer journey. Maybe your checkout process is confusing, the wait time to order is too long, or your return policies aren’t clear.\n\nLook for ways to simplify and streamline operations. For example, a restaurant might introduce online ordering, a plumbing company might add a booking widget to its website, and an ecommerce business might revise its return policies.\n\nSupport pain points\n\nSupport pain points refer to any issues with customer service. Maybe it takes a long time for your customers to get through on the phone, or to get a reply from your email customer service desk. If customers can’t get help when they need it or feel unsupported, it damages the customer experience.\n\nTake steps to improve the level of customer support you provide, whether that’s through staff training or adding customer support tools.\n\nFinancial pain points\n\nFinancial pains relate to the cost of a product or service. If potential customers feel something is overpriced or they can’t afford it, they won’t buy it. Perhaps your prices are much higher than the competition, or you’re not successfully communicating the value that your product or service provides.\n\nThe solution doesn’t always require lowering your prices. Sometimes it’s just a matter of adjusting your product and service descriptions, so that customers understand what they are paying for.\n\nProduct pain points\n\nThese pains happen when customers face issues with your actual product or service. Maybe your offering lacks certain features or options that customers want. Or perhaps there are consistent quality or functionality problems.\n\nIt can be difficult to identify exactly what aspects of your product or service aren’t meeting your customers’ expectations, but once you know where the issues lie, you can adapt your offering to overcome this pain point.\n\nHow to identify your customers’ pain points\n\nYou can’t address customer pain points unless you know what they are. The first step to enhancing your customer experience and marketing strategy is always to identify customer pain points. Here are practical steps to take to discover them.\n\nConduct qualitative research\n\nThe best way to uncover pain points is to conduct qualitative research. Monitor social media discussions about your business, read reviews on sites like Yelp or Google, and interview customers to survey them about their experiences. Ask open-ended questions to find out where their frustrations lie.\n\nPinpoint leading customer pain points\n\nLook for common themes in customer responses to identify the biggest pain points. These are the issues that you want to address first. For example, maybe customers complain about long wait times, confusing billing, or difficulty getting questions answered.\n\nLook for different types of pain\n\nRemember that customers can face different types of pain, including process pain points, support pain points, financial pain points, and product pain points. Keeping these different types of pain points in mind helps you to spot them as you review customer responses.\n\nStrategies for addressing customer pain points\n\nOnce you’re aware of customer pain points and you’ve put in the work to identify them, you’re ready to address them. You want to change those aspects of your business that are causing customers pain, so that they’ll be more satisfied and keep coming back.\n\nAddress customer pains strategically\n\nThe exact steps you take will depend on which type of pain points you identify. For example, you might:\n\nReview your internal systems and workflows to simplify the customer experience. You may need to redesign parts of your website or app\n\nRetrain employees or implement new tools and systems, like live chatbots or knowledge bases, to respond faster or more effectively\n\nRevisit how you explain charges and processes, or rewrite your policies and protocols\n\nConsider adjusting your pricing or product features to better meet customer needs\n\nRun promotions and discounts, and make payment plans available for high-cost items\n\nWhatever changes you make, be sure to promote them as part of your marketing strategy.\n\nTurn pains into opportunities\n\nDon’t see customer pain points as negatives—view them as opportunities to strengthen your messaging. Create content on your website, blog, newsletter, and social media that teaches customers how to overcome their pains, or announces how you’ve improved your product and processes. This builds goodwill and turns dissatisfied customers into loyal advocates.\n\nContinuously monitor the customer journey\n\nCustomer pain points can change over time. Regularly monitor social media, survey customers, and evaluate feedback to identify new or recurring frustrations. Then make addressing these pains a priority by creating a plan of action and delegating changes to the appropriate teams. Your sales, customer service, product development, and marketing teams should all work together to improve the customer experience.\n\nReducing customer pain points improves your business\n\nBy identifying and addressing customer pain points, you can turn frustrations into opportunities. Continually listening to your customers, evaluating how their needs change, and refining your processes will give you valuable insights to drive improvements, strengthen your customer experience, and boost your success. When you consistently meet customers’ needs, they’ll become loyal fans,and your small business will thrive.",
      "# [Vodafone Business boosts digital productivity for smaller businesses in partnership with vcita](https://www.vodafone.com/news/technology/vodafone-business-boosts-digital-productivity-for-smaller-businesses-in-partnership-with-vcita)\nVodafone Business is helping small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) effectively compete with their larger competitors by offering a secure and affordable productivity app in partnership with leading business management software provider vcita. SMEs are the driving force behind economic development, contributing 55% to the EU’s Gross Domestic Product, and the app will give them the same productivity advantages that large companies already enjoy.\n\nCalled Vodafone Business Management tool with vcita, the app replaces many time-consuming and costly manual tasks with new automated and digital services, enabling SMEs to boost productivity, improve customer relations, and increase revenue. It is part of Vodafone’s expanding portfolio of software and bundled connectivity products specifically aimed at helping SMEs with their own digital transformations.\n\nThe app has been launched initially in Italy (at an affordable cost of €45 per month for the CRM starter or a more advanced version at €75 per month) and will be progressively rolled out in other European markets. According to research, around 84% of SMEs still rely on manual processes to fulfil daily tasks, like invoicing, which on average equates to around 120 working hours per annum for every business. The app is especially designed to help small businesses with limited resources cost-effectively digitalise key tasks whilst managing and growing their customer base.\n\nGiorgio Migliarina, Interim CEO of Vodafone Business, said: “Vodafone Business’ goal is to become the trusted partner for all companies, both small and large, on their digital journey.

We’re proud to be the technology provider powering this solution and we look forward to our continued partnership.”\n\nNote to Editors\n\nVodafone Business SME focus\n\nVodafone provides a variety of SaaS (Software as a Service) applications for businesses of all sizes to help them improve their productivity, collaboration, sales, and marketing. Some of the most popular SaaS apps include offerings from Microsoft and Google, as well as digital presence applications delivered directly by Vodafone. The Apps are available through the Vodafone Business Marketplace, which provides customers with a single cloud-based platform to use and manage business applications securely.\n\nIn addition to Vodafone Business Marketplace, Vodafone Business is offering SME’s a free digital advisory service called V-Hub, which has more than five million users from Vodafone Business.

The report adds that financial services or fintech firms often find it difficult to serve the diversified SME market’s wide-ranging needs.\n\nMastercard announced this week that it is out to overhaul small and midsize businesses’ access to the business management tools they need. Noting that it recently met its goal of bringing 50 million micro, small and midsized businesses into the digital economy through online payment acceptance, Mastercard says it’s offering its new Biz360 application suite as a “comprehensive digital solution” designed to let fintech providers equip their small and midsized business customers “with a simplified way to manage the most critical aspects of running and growing a business.”\n\n“We’re committed to empowering small businesses for the digital future by providing the innovative technologies they need to succeed,” says Jane Prokop, executive vice president and global head of small and medium enterprises.\n\nMastercard says SMEs find friction in using digital tools\n\nIn a study report it released last year, Mastercard noted that 75% of small businesses use digital tools in their daily operations, and that two-thirds of them listed “a seamless, digital experience as critical to their business.”\n\nBut it added, “The experience is far from frictionless with 25% of small business owners burdened by using more than six different platforms.”\n\nIn a separate Foundry report released in June, Mastercard noted that “small businesses revealed that they are using up to four different tools to manage their invoicing alone.”\n\nMastercard’s Biz360 digital features\n\nBiz360’s and capabilities include:\n\n⦁ A client portal where small business owners can “manage and cultivate customer relationships, boost loyalty through personalized email and marketing campaigns, and enhance their digital presence with website creation capabilities.\n\n⦁ Personalized business performance reports, “allowing business owners to unlock valuable insights that help guide more informed decision making.\n\n⦁ Automating administrative tasks and integrating business management tools into a single platform, allowing entrepreneurs to “focus on strategic, revenue-generating activities.”\n\n⦁ The ability to consolidate digital operational tools, subscriptions and payment gateways into single digital experience instead of relying on siloed technologies.\n\nProkop says Biz360 “is designed to support small businesses at every stage of growth, allowing a small business owner to select the subscription tier best fit for their needs. The platform subscription cost is determined by the distribution partner.”\n\nMastercard adds that deploying and integrating the Biz360 suite “requires minimal effort from both [fintech] providers and their small business customers.”\n\nMastercard rolls out Biz360 with Hello Alice\n\nTo initially roll out Biz360, Mastercard will collaborate with Hello Alice, a small business fintech platform. Hello Alice describes its operation as an online platform that guides business owners “through every step of their entrepreneurial journey by providing knowledge, funding, networks and peer-to-peer connections with more than 1 million small business owners.” Its website includes links to business services, including an application for a Hello Alice Small Business Mastercard.\n\n“We’re committed to empowering Main Street by equipping American small business owners with the tools they need to succeed in today’s fast-paced, digitally-driven economy,” says Elizabeth Gore, co-founder and president at Hello Alice.\n\nMastercard is also collaborating with vcita, a digital technology platform designed for organizations that serve the small businesses in such areas as customer engagement, payment collection and time management.\n\n“Our collaboration with Mastercard facilitates the digitization of operations, helping small businesses maximize growth and customer satisfaction,” says Itzik Levy, vcita’s founder and CEO.\n\nGoing forward, Mastercard says it “aims to broaden Biz360’s reach across additional markets in 2025 and expand the platform’s capabilities to address the evolving needs of small business owners.”\n\nPaul Demery is a Digital Commerce 360 contributing editor covering B2B digital commerce technology and strategy.
