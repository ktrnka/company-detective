The app runs like it was developed in 2008 and never updated since. I have to force quit the app every time I want to reopen it otherwise nothing will load. Start up time is sometimes over 20 seconds before anything displaces on the screen and the interface is extremely laggy when it’s actually running. The whole thing needs to be fixed. Just awful.",
      "# Extremely glitchy, 1 stars [(Alan261237, Apple App Store, 2024-01-19)](https://apple/10841242124)\nVcita is probably the most glitchy “professional” software I have ever used. I spend more time tracking down bugs than any other software I have ever used in my 23 year career. It’s if they do it on purpose to make you frustrated. Support is responsive 75 percent of time which is pretty decent the problem is the sheet number if glitches never allows you to use the product with at least 3 open tickets with support. Very disappointing.",

All my clients pay thru the CRM, so no more cashapp and Venmo. All of my important docs are stored in my CRM. I can send estimates with E-sign feature through my CRM. All clients get receipts for all of their payments through my CRM. My clients contact me through my CRM, so no more texting, FB messenger and iG DMs. I can even market to all my clients with the Marketing feature. This CRM will literally do everything that you need it to do. \n\nAnd btw they offer partnership opportunities where if you have a business like I do (marketing agency) you can white-label the software and resell it to your own clients!",

What makes this product shine is the ease of use, for you the owner and for clients. It’s also extremely flexible with the ability to customize everything. With a little help from a seasoned pro, this tool can do anything from scheduling, reminders, payments and my favorite is the ability to integrate with Zapier - that’s when the real fun starts since you can share information between vCita and apps like QuickBooks, ship-station and so on.

A booking requires payment before the booking goes through, and I only accept payments through PayPal.\n\nA client booked a consultation and then immediately sent me a message saying they wanted to cancel.  I refunded their payment.\n\nThey have since kept contacting me saying they didn't receive the refund.  I sent them a screenshot from PayPal showing the refund.  The person contacting me is identifying themselves as an \"Administrator\" and is someone different than the person who booked the call.\n\nThey said they paid through Venmo--I'm not even sure if that's possible with Vcita and/or PayPal, but whatever, on my end it's a PayPal payment and I refunded it, so I'm done.\n\nThere is absolutely zero chance that I send them money any other way, so their scam won't succeed.\n\nBut it seems like about the stupidest scam ever.  They actually sent me money through PayPal--I don't think there's a way for them to book without sending me money.  So the scam would have the risk that some people don't refund their original payment.\n\nThis is my first one of these in about 6 years of booking consultations this way.\n\nThoughts?\n\n## Comment ID ijmxllo with +18 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-08-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/taxpros/comments/wkbna1/weird_potential_scam/ijmxllo/) (in reply to ID wkbna1):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID ijmzwqr with +8 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-08-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/taxpros/comments/wkbna1/weird_potential_scam/ijmzwqr/) (in reply to ID ijmxllo):\n>They probably paid with stolen PayPal credentials or with a stolen credit card via PayPal.\n\nAh, makes sense, that explains it.\n\n## Comment ID ijohjuh with +2 score by [(attosec, Reddit, 2022-08-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/taxpros/comments/wkbna1/weird_potential_scam/ijohjuh/) (in reply to ID wkbna1):\nYou wrote “I refunded their payment”.

Not doing enough stuff.\n2. Doing too much of the wrong stuff.\n\nIf your problem is the former then I recommend you try reading Deep Work by Cal Newport which talks about ways to shut out distraction and be more effective and then start timeboxing in order to be more efficient.\n\nIf your problem is the latter than I can suggest The One Thing by Gary Keller which discusses prioritisation and related matters.\n\n## Comment ID h0o0yn6 with +2 score by [(SunchokePuree, Reddit, 2021-06-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/nsiu7a/do_any_freelancerssoloentrepreneurs_have_time/h0o0yn6/) (in reply to ID nsiu7a):\nTime management is everything for entrepreneurs, and yet it is an art form that is never fully perfected. All efforts to learn to do it better are worth the time and energy! \n\nI personally do a lot of just article-reading on Time Management Strategies via Google and read whatever catches my eye based on what I’m feeling like I need. \n\nGoogle The Pomodoro technique - it is fantastic and has been a great foundational system for people with huge blocks of time or are in charge of their own schedules to stay productive but not overdo it. \n\nTracking your time and using a timer are essential  because often we don’t even realize exactly how that time is being used. It’s a great exercise that can be pretty enlightening. \n\nDon’t be surprised if what works one day starts to not work anymore. Things change and I’ve noticed that staying committed to the art of time management itself (versus, say, committing to a specific technique and never varying) is the key. Stay flexible, stay agile and don’t be afraid to drop a technique if it ISN’T working. Try something else instead. \n\nGood luck! \n\nIt’s a juggling act, but at a certain point it’s also like riding a bike, you start to get the hang of the balance of motion and can maneuver it around just like you would a bicycle.\n\n## Comment ID h0plyh2 with +2 score by [(BearRootCrusher, Reddit, 2021-06-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/nsiu7a/do_any_freelancerssoloentrepreneurs_have_time/h0plyh2/) (in reply to ID nsiu7a):\nThere is a simple system called COD(collect, organize, do) a modified version of Getting Things Done that is amazing.

There's a learning curve, and you're in the right place to learn about resources and techniques to improve. There are many different ways that someone can have poor time management.

Because of this pain point, I, together with my friends, have decided to address it by building a SaaS solution called [Teemly](https://www.teemly.io).  \n\nWe help freelancers just like you and I to manage several meetings. By using the booking links in our app, you can share your links to your clients and customers on which time you could accommodate them (so that you can have time for deep work and personal time) but on another note,  you can create your private workspace with the team you are working with where you can see easily the common free time you have.\n\n  \nWe designed Teemly in this way because we want to help people with time management issues like you to be able to own their time but as well as respect other people's time. I believe building this culture is definitely a need in this fast changing world.   \n\n\nHope you can check us out and maybe sign up now at [www.teemly.io/signup](https://www.teemly.io/signup).",

I was also really bad with my personal finances. It was a long difficult process, but now I can confidently say I can answer all of these questions and then some. \n\nIf you're struggling understanding business finances, I'd recommend reading [Financial Intelligence for Entrepreneurs](https://www.amazon.com/Financial-Intelligence-Entrepreneurs-Really-Numbers-dp-1422119157) \\- it's an excellent book for entrepreneurs with little or no financial background. I also read a few articles and books about bookkeeping so I could understand the process of double-entry accounting and better understand where the financial reports come from. \n\nOnce your business is growing and you have a few employees I'd absolutely recommend applying to the [Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses](https://www.10ksbapply.com/) program. They have cohorts at several different colleges around the country but if there's not one close to you there's also the national cohort (which is what I went through). It's kind of like an intense, condensed MBA program but instead of working on case studies or fictitious businesses, all the exercises are about your own business. The culmination of the program is a 5-year strategic growth plan for your business. The modules on money & metrics and growth through financing were especially insightful. I used to be a \"no debt\" kind of guy (after getting out of lots of debt when I was young and stupid) but I learned that debt can be a really effective way to grow your business and can enable you to grow a business much faster than by reinvesting profits alone. It was really eye-opening.\n\nIt's also a scholarshipped program meaning if you are accepted, it's completely free. Since I was in the national cohort I did have to pay for some travel expenses but they were minimal.\n\n### Comment ID i3u6iny with +1 score by [(alexyslang, Reddit, 2022-04-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sweatystartup/comments/ty4p24/as_a_small_business_owner_how_financially/i3u6iny/) (in reply to ID i3rsl5t):\nI am in the same position you were 20 years ago pal, I don't know how to answer these but I'll check I guess and give it a try, lol\n\n## Comment ID i3r7nv0 with +2 score by [(LittleMsSavoirFaire, Reddit, 2022-04-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sweatystartup/comments/ty4p24/as_a_small_business_owner_how_financially/i3r7nv0/) (in reply to ID ty4p24):\nI removed most of my Reddit contents in protest of the API changes commencing from July 1st, 2023.

We had so many write-offs, it was glorious.

Drake: This was originally my first choice. Lowest cost at $1,970 for unlimited returns.\n2. ProConnect: Some experience with it based on graduate class tax return projects. The integration with QBO is a plus. I would buy 10 1040's and 10 others at a cost of $1,157 and then PPR if I scale up.\n3. Ultratax: I have experience with Onesource based on my industry job (I know it's a different software but I'm hoping there are some similarities between the two). 100 total returns (up to 25 business) with 10 unique states for $2,785\n\nThis would be something I do on the side (my new job is non-accounting related and have 3-4 days off a week). I'm not expecting more than 10 clients my first year as I test the waters. If the client's require bookkeeping, I would want to do that as well so I have more control over the overall product. I don't think this will ever replace my full-time job because I really enjoy my current gig but I do see myself investing about 20-25 hours a week into it.\n\nI wouldn't say cost is no object but it's not the biggest factor in my decision. I'm looking for something that I could grow with in case this is something that really take's off and starts to question my current FT job.\n\nI'm based in NV but expect some CA clients.\n\nI'm leaning towards ProConnect based on the scalability and integrations with QBO but wanted to hear other's thoughts on what they would do if they were in my position.

I have the Ultratax pay per return package, I pay about $375 for a federal license then pay per return. I pay too much, but it's the best professional grade software available to a small office. I use to do a few dozen, but now it's just friends and family. I pay too much in exchange for having access to a top level software.  I'm too old and set in my ways to teach myself Drake, but I have heard people like it.  It reminds me of DOS, just looking at the input.

Are there any good resources?\n\n\n\n## Comment ID h17w17d with +45 score by [(Dependent_Advisor, Reddit, 2021-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/nw5wzu/how_do_you_manage_your_time_as_a_solopreneur/h17w17d/) (in reply to ID nw5wzu):\nI have some tips for you, having dealt with this in the past.\n\nCreate a To-Do list for all areas of your life. Put on paper all the tasks that need to be done. It will help you stay on top of it and will prevent procrastination. Do this for business and personal tasks.\n\nGoogle \"flow states\" and discover how to build focus and increase productivity. Deep concentration on a single task leads to greater efficiency and productivity in your work. There are numerous ways of training the brain to improve its ability to focus. If you google \"flow states\", you'll find numerous articles on the subject, and you can also train your mind to achieve flow states through various exercises, such as meditation, visualization, or journaling.\n\nConsume media that is relevant to your goals/objectives. That could be podcasts, books or webinars, there's a webinar from vCita on how to master time management that appears to align with your current objective: https://landing.vcita.com/time-management\n\nPlan your time ahead of time. I know exactly what I want to get done in a given day, week and month. This structure makes sure that I am spending time on the right things. I use google calendar to do this.\n\n### Comment ID h18rav1 with +8 score by [(retard_4725, Reddit, 2021-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/nw5wzu/how_do_you_manage_your_time_as_a_solopreneur/h18rav1/) (in reply to ID h17w17d):\nUnderrated comment. \n\nIf you read this thank you so much\n\n#### Comment ID h198gzc with +3 score by [(Dependent_Advisor, Reddit, 2021-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/nw5wzu/how_do_you_manage_your_time_as_a_solopreneur/h198gzc/) (in reply to ID h18rav1):\nYou are welcome!\n\n### Comment ID h19xzjo with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/nw5wzu/how_do_you_manage_your_time_as_a_solopreneur/h19xzjo/) (in reply to ID h17w17d):\nJust to touch on this great advice, my productivity shot up when I stopped giving myself generalized goals \"Need to get new leads\" and instead used much more focused verbage and timetables \"Need to reach out to 5 restaurant distributors by Wednesday\". That gives me much more direction and a harsher deadline. \n\nOne other thing I've done is learned to avoid what I call Schrodingers Task. In my case they're usually clients or projects that exist in limbo. Or realities that exist in limbo. I'll have a client for example who has a project that I'm not sure if they are serious about or not. Instead of just opening the box and seeing if it's real or not, I let it exist in a half way state for weeks or months because of the fear that it might not actually be anything at all. I used to do this as well with tasks that I feared were worse than they might be. Instead of tackling them to see what they were, I let them exist in a limbo state which made them either turn out to be nothing at all, or something that has now festered into something much much worse.\n\n### Comment ID h19j33q with +1 score by [(BlackJeanInvestor, Reddit, 2021-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/nw5wzu/how_do_you_manage_your_time_as_a_solopreneur/h19j33q/) (in reply to ID h17w17d):\nGood advice and I back it because I too follow similar schedule based structure which is in alignment to my long term goals in Health, Mind, Wealth, Emotion and Spiritual dimensions. aka domino stacking.

You put off doing something because it gives you anxiety. You have to find somebody to do that part of the business if it causes you that much stress.\n\n(Edit) My personal example: I didn't like doing billing. I have this self-doubt about my prices, \"is it really worth that much?\" So I always procrastinated and sometimes my customers get mad that they didn't get a bill for weeks. It's a weird psychological thing. Now I have a bookeeper who does it.

The more you schedule, the less you have to juggle. One way to start a routine is to identify and schedule any recurring tasks. What things do you do every day, week, etc.? These tend to be the business maintenance tasks. Schedule them so you don't think about them. Then plan the rest of your on-demand tasks of the day around that set schedule. Do you email clients every morning? Schedule it. Do you pay bills once a week? Set aside dedicated \"pay bills\" time on a specific day.\n\nThere are many time tracking and monitoring apps available. While I wouldn't recommend using monitoring apps for employees (either trust them or drop them), putting one on yourself will give you a real picture of how you're spending your time. Seeing how your day actually goes, instead of how you think it goes can be very eye-opening.\n\n## Comment ID h18buu1 with +1 score by [(Fatherof10, Reddit, 2021-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/nw5wzu/how_do_you_manage_your_time_as_a_solopreneur/h18buu1/) (in reply to ID nw5wzu):\nI have been doing this for a few years now and have built our company fairly large in that time all by myself.\n\n\nKinda like juggling the Urgent vs important \n\nPower list.\nhttps://andyfrisella.com/blogs/mfceo-project-podcast/kill-it-every-day-maximizing-productivity-with-andy-frisella-mfceo09\n\n## Comment ID h19eeax with +1 score by [(WeronikaBujnowska_, Reddit, 2021-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/nw5wzu/how_do_you_manage_your_time_as_a_solopreneur/h19eeax/) (in reply to ID nw5wzu):\nWhat works for me are lists and checklists!

      "# [Vodafone Business boosts digital productivity for smaller businesses in partnership with vcita](https://www.vodafone.com/news/technology/vodafone-business-boosts-digital-productivity-for-smaller-businesses-in-partnership-with-vcita)\nVodafone Business is helping small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) effectively compete with their larger competitors by offering a secure and affordable productivity app in partnership with leading business management software provider vcita. SMEs are the driving force behind economic development, contributing 55% to the EU’s Gross Domestic Product, and the app will give them the same productivity advantages that large companies already enjoy.\n\nCalled Vodafone Business Management tool with vcita, the app replaces many time-consuming and costly manual tasks with new automated and digital services, enabling SMEs to boost productivity, improve customer relations, and increase revenue. It is part of Vodafone’s expanding portfolio of software and bundled connectivity products specifically aimed at helping SMEs with their own digital transformations.\n\nThe app has been launched initially in Italy (at an affordable cost of €45 per month for the CRM starter or a more advanced version at €75 per month) and will be progressively rolled out in other European markets. According to research, around 84% of SMEs still rely on manual processes to fulfil daily tasks, like invoicing, which on average equates to around 120 working hours per annum for every business. The app is especially designed to help small businesses with limited resources cost-effectively digitalise key tasks whilst managing and growing their customer base.\n\nGiorgio Migliarina, Interim CEO of Vodafone Business, said: “Vodafone Business’ goal is to become the trusted partner for all companies, both small and large, on their digital journey. Our partnership with vcita is part of our investment in the development of software, cloud, and cyber security products specifically for SMEs who are key to the future prosperity of our economies.”\n\n“We are thrilled to be partnering with Vodafone on a global level,” said Itzik Levy, CEO and Founder of vcita. “With Vodafone Business Management tool with vcita, Vodafone goes beyond the traditional role of a telecommunications provider and offers SMEs the ultimate digital business management solution that is critical to their success. We’re proud to be the technology provider powering this solution and we look forward to our continued partnership.”\n\nNote to Editors\n\nVodafone Business SME focus\n\nVodafone provides a variety of SaaS (Software as a Service) applications for businesses of all sizes to help them improve their productivity, collaboration, sales, and marketing. Some of the most popular SaaS apps include offerings from Microsoft and Google, as well as digital presence applications delivered directly by Vodafone. The Apps are available through the Vodafone Business Marketplace, which provides customers with a single cloud-based platform to use and manage business applications securely.\n\nIn addition to Vodafone Business Marketplace, Vodafone Business is offering SME’s a free digital advisory service called V-Hub, which has more than five million users from Vodafone Business. V-Hub helps SMEs and small-office, home-offices (SOHOs) increase their understanding of the complexities of the evolving digital landscape by providing them with personal advice and exclusive content on how they can navigate their own digital transformation.\n\nvcita secure platform\n\nHosted on vcita’s secure platform, which was developed alongside small businesses and partners over the past 12 years, Vodafone Business Management tool with vcita provides customers with many features needed to thrive in today’s digital economy which often come at a premium from other providers.

      "# [Top 3 Appointment Scheduling Software: Comparison of Acuity Scheduling, vCita Online Scheduling and SimplyBook.me by Adam Goldberg on 2019-11-29](https://financesonline.com/top-3-appointment-scheduling-software/)\nWhat is the best appointment scheduling software?\n\nThe best appointment scheduling software is Acuity Scheduling. It has a flexible availability manager, which lets you block time slots or days on your calendar. With it, you can accept appointments around the clock. It also helps you increase bookings by integrating with Facebook, Instagram, as well as website building and hosting services.\n\nHave you ever lost a customer because you could not agree on an appointment time? Have you had days when you only had a few bookings? Perhaps you have encountered clients who opted not to show up to a meeting at the last minute?\n\nIf you answered ‘yes’ to any or all of those questions, there’s a good chance you may already be on the lookout for an appointment scheduling software. The only problem is you’re still undecided as to which one to subscribe to. That is understandable — there are numerous options, each with its unique set of features and tools.\n\nSo, to help you out, we prepared this article discussing the top 3 appointment scheduling software — Acuity Scheduling, vCita Online Scheduling, and SimplyBook.me. With this, you will get in-depth insights into the similarities and differences between these products in terms of features and pricing. After this, you should be able to decide which one ticks all the boxes for you.\n\nThe use of appointment scheduling tools is on the rise. In 2018 alone, the market was valued at $199.67 million. By 2026, experts predict that the global appointment scheduling market will hit $518.91 million.\n\nBusinesses, regardless of size, are increasingly relying on this kind of solution. One of the main reasons is convenience. For example, a customer can choose to set an appointment with a clinic for the following day, even after office hours. Meanwhile, an establishment can regularly fill its schedule book because it can accept appointments online at any given hour.\n\nAppointment scheduling software are also becoming popular because of their integration with social platforms. To put this into perspective, Facebook is now the biggest social network with 2.45 billion active users. The company also reports that 2.8 billion people use Facebook, Inc.’s core services every month. That includes Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger.\n\nThat said, for a business to attract bookings as well as nurture leads to increase sales, social media visibility is essential. However, integrating with other applications is just one capability an online appointment scheduler offers. There are others that are worthy of noting that can reduce no-shows and increase recurring visits, which we will discuss further below.\n\n1. Acuity Scheduling\n\nAcuity Scheduling serves to create a platform that works around the clock for you as an online scheduling assistant. It ensures that you take advantage of every appointment opportunity from a potential or existing client.\n\nTo that end, the appointment scheduling software empowers customers to self-schedule. Moreover, if they need to modify their selected time frame, they can do so. In fact, Acuity Scheduling enables them to change their appointments repeatedly. That is until they have settled on the best time.\n\nIn relation to this, clients can see your availability in real-time. So, whenever you make changes to your appointment book, they can see it immediately. As such, they can adjust their schedules accordingly. By doing so, you can give your clientele a heads up when you are available to serve them.\n\nKey features of Acuity Scheduling\n\nReal-time Appointment Availability\n\nClient Intake Forms\n\nCustom Appointment Confirmations and Reminders\n\nIntegration with Third-party Tools\n\n2. vCita Online Scheduling\n\nvCita Online Scheduling frees your time for other tasks with its online scheduling capabilities. Even when you are busy, you can continue booking appointments and managing them. This is because the appointment scheduling software is accessible to clients through the service portal.\n\nThere are other options for scheduling, too, such as through Facebook or your website. Whichever you opt to use, you can expect every appointment to appear in your calendar. It is not just any calendar, though, it is color-coded, enabling you to distinguish between services. Because of this, you have an idea of how your day would be like at a single glance.\n\nFurthermore, you can rest assured that you can check your schedule at any time. This is possible as vCita Online Scheduling can synchronize with your favorite calendar tool.\n\nIf you want to investigate the features closely you can easily do so when you sign up for vCita Online Scheduling free trial here.\n\nKey features of vCita Online Scheduling\n\nOn-the-Go Appointment Scheduling\n\nClient Portal\n\nColor-Coded Calendar\n\nAutomatic Schedule Confirmation\n\n3. SimplyBook.me\n\nSimplyBook.me reviews tell us that this is a simple online booking platform. Nevertheless, it offers robust features, beginning with its mobile-optimized booking website. You can make available services, service providers, and packages there.\n\nOn the same note, you can inform customers how much they need to pay. It is at this point that you can direct them to the page where they can pay for their bookings online. However, if that does not work for them, they can pay for services on-site through your POS.\n\nThen, you can entice them to come back and continue patronizing your business with automated “come back soon” messages.\n\nIf you want to know more about the features it has to offer, you can easily sign up for SimplyBook.me free trial here.\n\nKey features of SimplyBook.me\n\nMobile-Adaptable Booking Website\n\nSMS and Email Appointment Reminders\n\nBusiness Analytics\n\nIntegration and API\n\nComparison of Key Features\n\nScheduling tools\n\nAcuity Scheduling, vCita Online Scheduling, and SimplyBook.me all double as your always-online assistant. Through them, clients can book their appointments at any time. As a result, you can say goodbye to long email threads, text exchanges, and phone calls.\n\nHowever, when it comes to controlling your availability, Acuity Scheduling offers the most flexibility. It allows you to block specific time slots and even add personal tasks to your calendar. Of course, it still lets you control which sections of your calendar you want your customers to see.\n\nCompare that with vCita Online scheduling, which limits what you can do with your availability. It does let you set regular business hours and specific times on particular dates. However, when blocking off time, you have to do so manually.\n\nWhen it comes to appointment rescheduling, both Acuity Scheduling and vCita Online Scheduling gives your clients free rein. Despite that, you can set certain limitations to protect your business. For example, you can prevent rescheduling a day or two before the appointment.\n\nIn this regard, SimplyBook.me differs because it does not have a rescheduling or editing option. Instead, it allows customers to cancel the booking to make another one.\n\nVerdict: Both Acuity Scheduling and vCita Online Scheduling are a notch above SimplyBook.me when it comes to scheduling flexibility. Still, Acuity Scheduling wins this round because it has more configurations for scheduling control. You can see this in the time/date blocking, especially.\n\nClient management\n\nIn a nutshell, all top 3 appointment scheduling software have client management interfaces. And yet, each one has its own unique approach to the task.\n\nFor example, SimplyBook.me has simple client management tools. It lets you edit the client’s name, email, and phone number on one tab. You can also modify their SMS and email subscriptions on that page, too. On another, it shows the complete address.\n\nOn the other hand, Acuity Scheduling has a more comprehensive set of client management features. It shows the customer’s name, email, and contact number, together with notes and intake forms. The application enables you to manage appointments with the customer on their client page, as well. Additionally, you have the right to ban a person and explain to them why.\n\nLastly, vCita Online Scheduling has similar features, but with the addition of payments, documents, and conversations. The latter is especially helpful in having two-way exchanges with clients. You can use this as you would use a live chat software creatively for marketing.\n\nVerdict: vCita Scheduling has more tools on its client management window. But if you want to be able to ban a client without facing them, Acuity Scheduling is for you.\n\nSocial and web integration\n\nIntegrations are an essential aspect of any software, as it allows users to connect their favorite tools. With this, they can extend the functionalities of any platform. Acuity Scheduling, SimplyBook.me, and vCita Online Scheduling are no different.\n\nAcuity Scheduling can connect with Facebook and Instagram; two of the most used social platforms on the planet. Because of this, your target audience can set an appointment with you without leaving their favorite social sites.\n\nAdditionally, you can add your online scheduler to your website. The solution supports WordPress, Wix, Weebly, and Squarespace. Other platforms you can integrate your widget with are GoDaddy, Joomla!, Drupal, Webs, and Zenfolio.\n\nSimplyBook.me has a similar approach; it can integrate with Facebook but not with Instagram. Instead, it can connect with Line, a messaging app whose focus market is Asia. This is beneficial if you have clients in the region who prefer to use the app. In addition, you can add their booking widgets to your website.\n\nWith vCita Online Scheduling, you have a Facebook Pages integration as well as a website widget. Additionally, it helps you connect with a Google service called Reserve with Google. Through this, potential customers can book your services from Google Search, Google Maps, and Reserve with Google.\n\nVerdict: If you are looking to integrate with as many channels as possible, Acuity Scheduling is a strong choice. Its basic integrations already include Facebook and Instagram, as well as several platforms for website building and website hosting solutions. Should you need more, you can always connect with your Zapier account. Through this, you can interface with other messaging platforms like Telegram and WhatsApp.\n\nMarketing options\n\nThe volume of your appointments is directly related to your marketing efforts. The three online scheduling vendors we’re investigating here seem to understand this. This is evident in how they include marketing tools.\n\nWith vCita Online Scheduling, it is easy to find the marketing toolbox. It has ready-to-go automated campaigns, among which are birthday emails. Plus, you can add your own custom automated campaigns and use these email marketing trends for 2020 together with those. Furthermore, the application helps you promote your business with announcements. You can even schedule the delivery if you are just planning ahead.\n\nOn the other hand, the Acuity Scheduling and SimplyBook.me marketing tools are not as obvious. What they have are selections for coupons, subscriptions, and gift certificates. However, like vCita Online Scheduling, these two also offer support for email and SMS reminders, which also serve as marketing vehicles.\n\nVerdict: vCita Online Scheduling has the most focused collection of marketing tools. Moreover, just like Acuity Scheduling and SimplyBook.me, it has email and SMS reminders too.\n\nPricing\n\nAcuity Scheduling and SimplyBook.me both offer a free plan. One main difference between the two is the reminder messages. The former does not provide the feature while the latter does.\n\nAnother thing is customization. Acuity Scheduling gives you a simple, no-nonsense scheduling page while SimplyBook.me has an array of theming options. These are available when you are beginning to configure your booking site. And in case you change your mind later, you can also select another theme.\n\nRegarding pricing subscriptions, all three are scalable. But among them, SimplyBook.me has the most affordable basic package. On the other hand, Acuity Scheduling has more advanced features for its first-tier option. Meanwhile, vCita Online Scheduling has the priciest packages.\n\nVerdict: SimplyBook.me has a better free plan. In addition, it has a more affordable first-tier subscription package. However, Acuity Scheduling’s upper-tier tariffs are the least expensive.\n\nFind the Right Online Booking Software for You\n\nMore businesses today are adopting online booking. Specifically, hospitals and clinics are investing in these apps to meet the millennial market’s demand for convenience. Even restaurants are embracing the technology so they can better manage issues related to staffing.\n\nYou may even be experiencing a need for an online booking platform in your field. The top 3 appointment scheduling software we discussed are designed to meet the requirements of businesses in different industries. They have the important availability management features and have value-added tools that make them worth your investment.\n\nAmong the three, we believe Acuity Scheduling has the best value-for-money proposition. It has a free plan that is good for freelancers, small teams, and startups. Its pricing scheme is also the most advantageous — if you have a tight budget but want a comprehensive set of features, it would not disappoint.",
