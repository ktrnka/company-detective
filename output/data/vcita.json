      "# [Download and manage your leads! on 2023-10-31](https://www.vcita.com/templates/crm)\nUse your CRM template to map your client’s sales journey\n\nThink about your customers’ journey from discovering your business to booking with you, and what steps you take to communicate with them. Your sales funnel is a good place to start. Picture all your potential customers at the top of the funnel, and what steps they take as they move down the four stages: awareness, interest, decision, and action.\n\n1. Awareness stage\n\nAt the top of your sales funnel are customers that know about you, usually called the “awareness” stage—maybe they’ve just done a Google search and found your website, or discovered you on social media. These are usually cold leads.\n\nHow your customers find you are your lead sources. For example, you might get customers through referrals, Facebook, lead pages, directories, or paid ads.\n\nIf you use a CRM template to track lead sources, over time you’ll be able to figure out what ones are getting you clients and what ones aren’t.Interest stage: a smaller subset of your customers might start reading your blog, looking through your website, or comparing you to some of your competitors—the “interest” stage. These are warm leads; they’ve shown interest in your service, but haven’t committed yet.\n\nThis is the stage when you might collect some of their info—for example, if someone signs up for your email list or downloads an ebook on your website. Take note of any specialized info you gather, so you can add it to your sales lead template.\n\nThink about how you nurture leads in this stage of the process. When do you reach out to them? How often?\n\n2. Decision stage\n\nA client might book a consultation or appointment in the “decision” stage. These are hot leads; they’ve made an active decision towards making a purchase.\n\nKeep in mind that your lead isn’t a customer until you get paid. It’s all too common for people to book an appointment and cancel before they go, so it’s still important to nurture leads in this stage.\n\nAfter the decision stage, give some thought to actions like follow up emails and appointment reminders that will give your clients that extra push to commit. Don’t let forgetfulness be the reason why you lose clients!\n\n3. Action stage"

A booking requires payment before the booking goes through, and I only accept payments through PayPal.\n\nA client booked a consultation and then immediately sent me a message saying they wanted to cancel.

The person contacting me is identifying themselves as an \"Administrator\" and is someone different than the person who booked the call.\n\nThey said they paid through Venmo--I'm not even sure if that's possible with Vcita and/or PayPal, but whatever, on my end it's a PayPal payment and I refunded it, so I'm done.\n\nThere is absolutely zero chance that I send them money any other way, so their scam won't succeed.\n\nBut it seems like about the stupidest scam ever.

Any other platforms you would recommend or dis-recommend as a tutor?\n\n## Comment ID i1jlfgr with +12 score by [(axiom_tutor, Reddit, 2022-03-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/tutor/comments/tjebc1/is_wyzant_a_good_platform_for_tutors_what_are/i1jlfgr/) (in reply to ID tjebc1):\nWyzAnt takes an absolutely gigantic cut of your pay (25%).  So to make the rate you're hoping to, you have to set your rate very high.  \n\nWyzAnt also says that they have an online platform for meetings, with a whiteboard and shared text editor.  But the whiteboard is buggy as hell and none of its solutions is better than the alternatives for online meetings.  I use Vibe and screen sharing through Zoom or whatever, even when I connect with students on WyzAnt.  \n\nThe thing that WyzAnt offers is a secured rating system, a payment system, and advertising.  WyzAnt comes up first in most searches for online tutoring, so you're going to get your \"cold contacts\" (i.e. people not referred to you through other connections) that way.  Also you can be sure you won't get someone who refuses to pay for the meeting because you can bill them.  Also, and this really important, nobody can rate you who hasn't met with you.  In any other system where someone can rate you without hiring you, there will always be some tutor who is competing with you and will negatively rate you so that they relatively advance in the rating system.  \n\nSo WyzAnt kinda sucks but you're missing out if you don't list yourself there.  It's the way of the world right now.  \n\nThe bonus is that it's free to put a profile on there, and the background check is cheap, so why not just do it?\n\nI would say likewise, just throw a profile on every other free site.  Why not?  But as far as I know there is no \"good\" online tutoring platform.  If they put any money into being highly placed in Google search returns, they don't pay you hardly anything.\n\n### Comment ID ikr3hxr with +8 score by [(AppointmentFun7525, Reddit, 2022-08-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/tutor/comments/tjebc1/is_wyzant_a_good_platform_for_tutors_what_are/ikr3hxr/) (in reply to ID i1jlfgr):\n25% cut is nothing, especially with the nationwide marketing and access to clientele you get through WyzAnt. I’m curious to know which companies let you keep 80% or more? \nMost local tutoring companies take half or more. I get $40-50/ hour for $80-$100 sessions with small local companies.  Princeton Review paid me $23/hour for private tutoring while pocketing $114. You can absolutely keep more percentage by going out on your own, but you need to have enough traffic on your site to make it worth it.\nPersonally, I’m happy to pay the 25% for marketing, scheduling, posting testimonials and ratings, allowing me to charge for last minute cancellations, and saving me the time to “convince” each and every new client that I’m worth the money. \nWyzAnt also keeps excellent track of lessons and finances which is a huge help for taxes and loan applications. It’s like paying an office assistant to do all that for me, and I’m okay with that. \nAgain, I would like to know which companies are letting you keep more than $80 because I will gladly switch if the services are comparable!\n\n#### Comment ID iky1l5z with +1 score by [(axiom_tutor, Reddit, 2022-08-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/tutor/comments/tjebc1/is_wyzant_a_good_platform_for_tutors_what_are/iky1l5z/) (in reply to ID ikr3hxr):\n25% is definitely something.  Sure, there is a justification for taking a percentage, and getting top placement in search results isn't easy.  But 25% is pretty borderline insane, and I would not at all characterize my attitude toward it as happy.  10-15% would make me happy--I'd believe that that much is necessary for SEO, a webdev team, and management overhead.  But there is definitely some point at which I believe this is just them getting away with an outsized rate because they know they can get away with it, and 25% is in the neighborhood for me.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, I still do it, and just post an insanely inflated rate that relatively few people are willing to pay so that I get a reasonable rate.  And I sometimes get work that way.  But I also certainly look for ways around the trap too.\n\n### Comment ID i1jpmt7 with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-03-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/tutor/comments/tjebc1/is_wyzant_a_good_platform_for_tutors_what_are/i1jpmt7/) (in reply to ID i1jlfgr):\nThanks!

It does have some advantages (some marketing for you, you set your own rates, and they do all the collections).

The integration with QBO is a plus. I would buy 10 1040's and 10 others at a cost of $1,157 and then PPR if I scale up.\n3.

I'm not expecting more than 10 clients my first year as I test the waters. If the client's require bookkeeping, I would want to do that as well so I have more control over the overall product.

It's super easy to set up and integrate into an existing site (just add a link). The benefit over other booking systems is it integrates with payments out of the box and supports cancellation fees. When a customer books via the flow, you can require them to put down a 50 cent credit card hold and it saves their card on Stripe so you can charge a cancellation fee later.\n\nSo it's perfect for service businesses such as auto detail or hair salons that don't want random people to occupy booking slots and not show up. There are also some demo stores with fake data you can get to from the landing page if you want to check it out.\n\n* Optionally save payment information during bookings and charge cancellation fees for no-shows later on\n* Very easy integration into your website - no coding required\n* Send email and SMS appointment confirmations/reminders\n* Multiple Calendar/service customizations and reservation booking flow for customers. Opening hours, vacation days, open/closed days, etc.\n* Has a dashboard, CRM features, and can manage customers through it and process payments too",

You have a nice website, a good GMB presence, good customer service, and make it as easy as possible for customers to give you their information and contact you.\n\n>Essentially that's all there is to it. You make a \"funnel\" where it's fast and easy for customers to give you their information, and then you drive traffic to the funnel. Whether or not that's through Facebook ads, SEO, or flyers, the premise is the same.\n\n>I follow the /r/marketing subreddit to stay up to date with industry changes, and I'm a regular at various conferences, they're webinars in this covid world.

And those types of leads are a lot easier to close because you’ve been referred. But a business should not rely on just word of mouth only. The most valuable business that build value and make it easy to sell have a proven lead generating strategy. A business that has a website and other digital assets that has a consistent flow of leads through multiple lead streams will sell for a lot more money than one that just relies on word of mouth. We also help businesses build value and prepare owners that might one day pass on the business to children, their employees or sell out to retire. \nOwners that pass their business to children or employees often find themselves financing part of the business by taking a portion of the business’s profits every year.

My business google page: Get reviews from all your customers. This builds up over time. \n2. Add images and posts to my google business page. It helps with SEO.\n3. Have a Facebook page for your business.\n4. Get active in local Facebook groups. Make a generic poster for the kind of services you provide along with contact information. Post it bi-weekly in all the local Facebook groups.\n5. If you have a budget, Get a website and do local SEO. I would strongly advise, using voice searches term. Also, If there is any other language your core customers use, consider SEO of those terms as well. \n6. If you have a budget, Run Facebook ads and google ads.

Then focus on building a following. \n\nGet word of mouth referrals from FB, NextDoor, Insta, etc. Capture emails and just making quality regular posts or a giveaway that show community involvement are like gold, locals don't forget and when a need for the service arrives someone \"knows a guy\". Ad costs go down as you grow your email lists and following.\n\nMovers should ensure accurate google listing so you show up on a search with a pin on a map. Get in some lists from big companies that rank on first page results like uhaul and angies list, etc pay the fee to get listed. Make an offer to put on your ad, like \"use this coupon code to recieve 10% off for our Fall Moving Special\". Or free ____ if you book now (not sure about movers, so maybe cost of boxes, storage, packing material etc).\n\nIf you have a local page that advertises and ranks on google the service you provide, put an ad in with them. Or get one made using important keywords for example \"best ft. Lauderdale movers dot com or affordable east tennesee movers .net\" put your biz at the top on that and do SEO. \n\nNow someone types best mover in ft lauderdale into google, low and behold that hot lead sees your site,  your funnels, your social proof, and a 10% off coupon?

But mostly I use my content feed to tease projects and create content for my clients to use to build their respective client bases, benefitting me in the long run. \n\nFor example, I posted some detail shots of a project I’m about to complete, tagged the materials vendor and my client. My client was able to share the pics with her client as a fun status update, and I received 2 inquiries off her feed from other designers I’ve been wanting to work with for years. On another pic of a recently completed project, I had 3-4 of my client’s clients engage with the post, which in turn gave my clients the opportunity to sell this particular type of project to the end user that they otherwise wouldn’t have had. Other posts are used to educate the consumer base: time lapse videos of construction, demos of the equipment we use to make our products, etc. Consumers are very uneducated about custom manufacturing, so putting a human face and demonstrating the time and labor it takes to make our products goes a long way to minimize the sticker shock of our quotes. \n\nI know I’m approaching social media in a very strange way, but I gotta say it’s working for me.\n\n### Comment ID kgz6987 with +1 score by [(Local-Growth-Experts, Reddit, 2024-01-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/jicl2v/how_does_a_local_service_business_generate_leads/kgz6987/) (in reply to ID ga63exn):\nWhat type of business?

It's far too 'culty' for me.  The demand for X referrals or you slip down the weekly published leader board never sat well.\n\nWhen they took me into a separate side room after my second trial breakfast with them to ask about my intentions, I thought they were about to start handing out robes and requiring a blood sacrifice.  \n\nThe two guys that took me aside were apparently sales coaches, but clearly not good ones.  They used the most obvious hard pressure tactics in the book, the sort that no actually successful business has used since the 90s.  Looking into their backgrounds and client lists (publicly available via their shitty websites that hadn't been updated in 10 years), they were average salesmen at best during their careers and now strongarm businesses in dying industries run by fucking idiots into buying their \"5/7/9/15 step programme to sales success\" \n\nI was a member for about 6 months but refused to turn up again after one local business owner kept getting shit for not referring enough businesses, despite using another BNI member to build a £600k oak framed building.  Yes, it was one referral, but it eclipsed the other referral values combined for the rest of the year.  Apparently, that didn't matter.\n\nI actually lost a client over it (he was one of the grandmasters or whatever they call themselves), but the time I gained by not coming up with bullshit referrals and pushing people I shouldn't into rubbish meetings more than made up for the loss.

What words do they use to describe that problem?

Google my business is free and easy. Facebook is too. Websites cost a couple hundred bucks these days. Yelp is fucking bullshit. \n\nPaid search works if you know how to work it. There's a lot of PPC snake oil salesmen out there but also good ones and there's a bunch of articles on how to tell the difference. I'd have an expert do it rather than try it and not perform well. \n\nMany service companies will partner with lead generation companies: they're great at getting phone calls that they can pass to you but aren't electricians or whatever. It's nice to use them because it's one less thing you need to worry about but they do take a piece of the pie and you don't have as much control over how you're presented or what calls you get, and have no opportunity to build a brand. \n\nThere's other methods that work. If you work on their property and do work that is visible, see if you can put up $10 yards signs so their neighbors can call you. Someone gave out $500 in lotto scratchers and got $14,000 in work from it. I gave out $50 gift cards to people that referred clients and got 2-3 more usually. \n\nMost importantly though: whenever you get a new customer ask them 1) how did you hear about us 2) what made you choose us. Your strongest marketing channels and value proposition are going to be things that you discover, not that you create.\n\n## Comment ID l9yh6of with +1 score by [(CreatorCrux, Reddit, 2024-06-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/jicl2v/how_does_a_local_service_business_generate_leads/l9yh6of/) (in reply to ID jicl2v):\nGenerating leads for a local service business in the digital space can greatly complement word-of-mouth referrals.

Google My Business (GMB)\n\n* **Set Up and Optimize**: Make sure your GMB profile is fully set up with all your business details, operating hours, and high-quality photos.\n* **Regular Updates**: Post updates, photos, and special offers regularly to keep your profile active.\n* **Encourage Reviews**: Ask satisfied customers to leave positive reviews, which can significantly boost your visibility and credibility.\n\n# 2. Local SEO\n\n* **Optimize Your Website**: Make sure your website is optimized for local searches. Include local keywords and create content around them.\n* **Create Location-Specific Pages**: If you serve multiple areas, create dedicated pages for each location with relevant keywords.\n* **Backlinks**: Get listed on local directories and engage in local community activities to earn backlinks.\n\n# 3. Social Media\n\n* **Engage with the Community**: Join local groups on Facebook, Nextdoor, and other platforms to engage with potential customers.\n* **Share Valuable Content**: Post regularly about your services, share tips related to your industry, and showcase customer testimonials.\n* **Run Local Ads**: Facebook and Instagram ads targeted to your local area can be very effective.\n\n# 4. Content Marketing\n\n* **Blog Posts**: Write blog posts that address common questions and issues related to your services. This can help attract organic traffic.\n* **Videos**: Create videos showcasing your work, customer testimonials, and behind-the-scenes looks at your business.\n\n# 5. Lead Scraping with Google Maps\n\n* **Find Leads**: Use Google Maps to search for businesses \"Near Me\" and collect their details.\n* **Gather Information**: Note down contact numbers, email addresses, and website links.\n* **Analyze and Target**: Identify high-value targets and assess their online presence to see where you can offer value.\n\nIf you'd like to watch a detailed YouTube video on how I scrape leads using Google Maps and other strategies, DM me and I'll send you the link.\n\n## Comment ID lk4zror with +1 score by [(TotalPeachCase, Reddit, 2024-08-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/jicl2v/how_does_a_local_service_business_generate_leads/lk4zror/) (in reply to ID jicl2v):\nwww.market-monster.com helps roofers and contractors… well any service based business.

Like, I need the tile behind by bathroom tub redone because I was scammed by a Craigslist tile guy who got called to another job and got his 'friend' who never did tile before to totally fuck my shit up. I was out of town, and now I have to pay double to get it redone. \n\nSo, how does one overcome the fear people have hiring the 'right person' for the job? \n\nThe thing I want to see is photos of completed jobs that look almost exactly like mine. I want to see even tile, straight lines, nice cut tile that is symmetrical and not chipped, crooked, or janky. Photos that are high quality, but here is the thing. They can't be stock-photo quality, but can't be piss poor flash in the image quality. Also, having a person holding a sign, or a sign in the shot that isn't photoshopped in with the company name on it, means it is most likely real photos. So that shows they are experienced.\n\nThe next thing is, if I am about to spend $1k-$5k, what kind of testimonials are there? Are they fake or real? A real one would have both a negative and a positive, with the negative being not so bad. Fake ones are like those crazy over the top with words like 'perfect' 'amazing' 'wonderful' and stuff that is clearly orgasmic with the verbiage. It sounds like an Amazon review for a Chinese product because it can do everything like cure cancer from having tile put in. Yea, skip that guy. Look for real reviews.\n\nWhat other fears are out there? What does the owner look like? Is there a photo of him? Does he look like Mr. Burns from the Simpsons, or does he look like George Clooney? I feel more trustful from George than Mr. Burns with that shady eye evil grin. I also want to speak to the owner and get at least a verbal guarantee that the job will be done right and not half assed. \n\nLastly, and this is a big one: respect of my home, and clean up. Will they wear booties? Will they be gentile in my open areas with tools and not scuff my hall walls coming down it with a bucket of grout? Will they wear booties, and not stink like booze? Are their hoodies clean or are they pit-stained like they came from a homeless shelter? \n\nI think when you market ANY service, you have to overcome the fears that people have and their objections and also sound at least, reasonable. Most of us don't mind paying a 'fair price' for a 'good job' but when you have the 'new guy' doing your job wrong, the owner has two choices: fix it, or lie and scam. So making sure your advertising is reflective of overcoming 'no' and the fears, means your campaign is going to hit better when it lands in my inbox or in a flyer.\n\n## Comment ID ga9a1nu with +1 score by [(mrmetis, Reddit, 2020-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/jicl2v/how_does_a_local_service_business_generate_leads/ga9a1nu/) (in reply to ID jicl2v):\nit has variations but we can say inbound and outbound. I suggest inbound where customers look for you. so you create local address included content related to your products, where people can continue asking or researching your service. in there they will be giving out their information from your landing page. \n\n\n\nafter they become leads you can categorize them waiting, contacted once, rejected, agreed etc. cold calls email but critical virtue is ''follow up''. if you pay for ads it can help but it should be designed different.\n\n\n\nI would also suggest creating a blog for long term exposure and creating an ''authority image'' in the industry but since I dont know what you exactly do, I dont know if this is a good option for you.\n\n\ngood luck.\n\n## Comment ID ga9ynsg with +1 score by [(Unemployed20, Reddit, 2020-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/jicl2v/how_does_a_local_service_business_generate_leads/ga9ynsg/) (in reply to ID jicl2v):\nHey man,\n\nWill avoid any woo-woo MLM psychology shit here (ABC, etc.) and will go straight to the nitty gritty of low-cost/highly effective lead gen.\n\nA bit about myself, I run a B2B Lead Gen team and several growth hacking communities across Whatsapp & Facebook.\n\nSo we will start of with email:\n\nIf you're servicing other businesses (hence B2B), you can simply scrape facebook's business page directory ([www.facebook.com/pages/category](http://www.facebook(.)com/pages/category)) for the exact business category you're scraping and go further down by location.\n\nI show how to do this right here: [https://youtu.be/KxF7yWDoqvM](https://youtu.be/KxF7yWDoqvM)\n\nLinkedin:\n\nLinkedin can also serve as an awesome B2B lead generation channel, especially locally, considering that you're able to run a search based on exact location & industry. This works best for white-collar businesses but can also yield results for the lesser complex service lines.\n\nFacebook:\n\nFor the B2C aspect of things, hence, finding houses to paint, cars to fix, etc. I'd strongly recommend Facebook or Instagram Ads. Test with small budgets and then double down budget wise on the ad sets that work best. Make sure to use Facebook's Ad Library to actually spy on your competition and get a good idea on which ads are performing well and which ads are not. Use Facebook to reach an older demographic, and use Instagram to reach your location's younger demographic.\n\nAdditionally note that from a B2B perspective, you can also scrape local small business owner groups within your region, save the profile URLs and then use a tool like Texau to outreach to 30 of them automatically per day. (More grey hat but super do-able)\n\nContent:\n\nSEO is super competitive, especially with keywords like \"Plumber near me\" or \"Mechanic near me\", but Youtube's SEO is much much more easier to dominate. This is exactly why I always recommend that \"long-sighted\" businesses actually take the time to create service-related content as it can drastically improve your deal flow in the long run. Much less of an upfront $$$ investment, but more of a time investment with crazy results.\n\nHope this helped.\n\nThose are my ideas from the top of my head, without looking at your site/url.\n\nIf you have more questions, DM.\n\n## Comment ID k8z6vjv with +1 score by [(Proof_Title116, Reddit, 2023-11-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/jicl2v/how_does_a_local_service_business_generate_leads/k8z6vjv/) (in reply to ID jicl2v):\nVery old thread, but I wanted to chime in on the topic. \n\nYou would not believe how many established companies don’t market to their email lists. \n\nNo matter what business you’re in - physical location, web-based, service, B2B/c - your email list should be top of mind and integrated properly into every single marketing effort (ppc, mailers, tv, web and print).\n\nI be happy to answer questions (if there are any) related to email marketing.\n\n## Comment ID kcypl8v with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-12-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/jicl2v/how_does_a_local_service_business_generate_leads/kcypl8v/) (in reply to ID jicl2v):\nRelevant? https://101databroker.com/generating-leads-for-small-businesses/\n\n## Comment ID kgz4i75 with +1 score by [(Local-Growth-Experts, Reddit, 2024-01-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/jicl2v/how_does_a_local_service_business_generate_leads/kgz4i75/) (in reply to ID jicl2v):\nThe most successful way to get local leads as a small local business is first get a website. It’s important when building a website that it’s built with getting local traffic in mind. Then build a GOOGLE Business Profile, and have it optimized for attracting local customers as well. Be sure to include optimized images in your website as well. It’s very important to make sure all of your business information NAP (Name, Address & Phone) are exactly the same as well as your hours of operation on both your GBP and your website. \n\nGoogle likes consistent information. Having the same information also builds trust and GOOGLE rewards websites it considers trustworthy. You should then Build citations (other mini type profiles that mainly consist of your NAP, brief description of your business and a few photos as well as your hours of business. \n\nThis and some other strategies can get even a new website to rank on the first page of Google within 30-90 days depending on location, niche (business type) and competition. Once your on the first page of Google other strategies are employed to maintain the position. There are only 10 organic spots available on a Google page. Statistics from a recent poll say that the first page of Google gets 87-95% of all website clicks for any given niche in any particular location. The second page drops drastically to less than 6%. So as the old saying goes…if you’re not First your last & this truly applies to being on google. \nOr you can also run Google campaigns for paid ads, facebook and instagram advertising. But when running paid advertising campaigns these should be well thought out campaigns as well. GOOD campaigns not only get you a ton of local business leads but the better your campaigns the cheaper your ad spend. \nA business should have a good strategy for getting a consistent flow of quality local leads in order to stay busy and grow its business. Stay away from lead generation sites that sell leads to multiple business at the same time. These leads are typically a waste of time and can really eat into profits. \nReach out for more local lead getting strategies!\nHope this helps some local small businesses!",

Put on paper all the tasks that need to be done. It will help you stay on top of it and will prevent procrastination. Do this for business and personal tasks.\n\nGoogle \"flow states\" and discover how to build focus and increase productivity. Deep concentration on a single task leads to greater efficiency and productivity in your work. There are numerous ways of training the brain to improve its ability to focus. If you google \"flow states\", you'll find numerous articles on the subject, and you can also train your mind to achieve flow states through various exercises, such as meditation, visualization, or journaling.\n\nConsume media that is relevant to your goals/objectives. That could be podcasts, books or webinars, there's a webinar from vCita on how to master time management that appears to align with your current objective: https://landing.vcita.com/time-management\n\nPlan your time ahead of time.

Instead of just opening the box and seeing if it's real or not, I let it exist in a half way state for weeks or months because of the fear that it might not actually be anything at all. I used to do this as well with tasks that I feared were worse than they might be.

The more you schedule, the less you have to juggle. One way to start a routine is to identify and schedule any recurring tasks. What things do you do every day, week, etc.? These tend to be the business maintenance tasks. Schedule them so you don't think about them. Then plan the rest of your on-demand tasks of the day around that set schedule. Do you email clients every morning? Schedule it. Do you pay bills once a week? Set aside dedicated \"pay bills\" time on a specific day.\n\nThere are many time tracking and monitoring apps available. While I wouldn't recommend using monitoring apps for employees (either trust them or drop them), putting one on yourself will give you a real picture of how you're spending your time. Seeing how your day actually goes, instead of how you think it goes can be very eye-opening.\n\n## Comment ID h18buu1 with +1 score by [(Fatherof10, Reddit, 2021-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/nw5wzu/how_do_you_manage_your_time_as_a_solopreneur/h18buu1/) (in reply to ID nw5wzu):\nI have been doing this for a few years now and have built our company fairly large in that time all by myself.\n\n\nKinda like juggling the Urgent vs important \n\nPower list.\nhttps://andyfrisella.com/blogs/mfceo-project-podcast/kill-it-every-day-maximizing-productivity-with-andy-frisella-mfceo09\n\n## Comment ID h19eeax with +1 score by [(WeronikaBujnowska_, Reddit, 2021-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/nw5wzu/how_do_you_manage_your_time_as_a_solopreneur/h19eeax/) (in reply to ID nw5wzu):\nWhat works for me are lists and checklists! I also use time tracking tools such as forest or indy as well. Planning and not leaving tasks for later always work the best for me\n\n## Comment ID h19n87x with +1 score by [(eggie82, Reddit, 2021-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/nw5wzu/how_do_you_manage_your_time_as_a_solopreneur/h19n87x/) (in reply to ID nw5wzu):\nAlways have a plan of what you intend to accomplish at the start of the day so when you sit down you know what you need to focus on. I have found the Pomodoro technique to be quite helpful in staying motivated and on task. It can be a long and lonely day doing it on your own sometimes so I try to schedule at least one client meeting a day too for a bit of human contact.\n\n## Comment ID h19pu4m with +1 score by [(Dickincheeks, Reddit, 2021-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/nw5wzu/how_do_you_manage_your_time_as_a_solopreneur/h19pu4m/) (in reply to ID nw5wzu):\nStay organized and be realistic with what you can commit to. Make time for your personal tasks so you avoid dreading your work responsibilities. Idk what you mean by resources but I doubt you need a better tool or app, it sounds like you need to build better habits.\n\n## Comment ID h1a7zrt with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/nw5wzu/how_do_you_manage_your_time_as_a_solopreneur/h1a7zrt/) (in reply to ID nw5wzu):\nCharge more and then hire people to do the work for you.\n\n## Comment ID h1a9czo with +1 score by [(reineedshelp, Reddit, 2021-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/nw5wzu/how_do_you_manage_your_time_as_a_solopreneur/h1a9czo/) (in reply to ID nw5wzu):\nDelegate, outsource, automate\n\n## Comment ID h1acy4m with +1 score by [(Ask_Are_You_Okay, Reddit, 2021-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/nw5wzu/how_do_you_manage_your_time_as_a_solopreneur/h1acy4m/) (in reply to ID nw5wzu):\nIt's trite business advice, but consider reading *The E Myth*.\n\nWhat's also helped me is to apply my software development background and use tools like kanbans and change management on a very small scale to organize and prioritize tasks and changes to how we do business.\n\n\"You can't manage what you can't see\" and all that. This can be as easy as buying different color sticky notes and writing down all your tasks and organizing them on the wall. \n\nThen once you have a good idea of *what* you need to do *how* often becomes more visible. \n\n\"Follow the money!\" as they say. When you ask whether task A or B is more important, ask yourself which one will in the grand scheme of things earn more money or save more time.\n\nFWIW as you're discovering, I've found time is far more difficult to come by than money.\n\nWhat you choose *not* to do is as important as what you choose *to* do.\n\n## Comment ID h1bi6fe with +1 score by [(startsmallco, Reddit, 2021-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/nw5wzu/how_do_you_manage_your_time_as_a_solopreneur/h1bi6fe/) (in reply to ID nw5wzu):\nBasically, priorities and these priorities should be generally related to what will bring you more money and what will help you to grow more, basically set goals for short periods. Organize your day with few things but that is very productive and that gives a lot of results.

The scheduler is connected to my personal calendar which allows me to work when / how I want to and live, too! I've been a customer for over two years and I will not leave. There are bells and whistles I still haven't tapped into and the customer service is great. I've only needed help with customer service once and it was resolved quickly.  The app is easy to manage, customize, and integrate with social media and my payment system. I absolutely love the appointment reminders my clients receive and how easy it is for them to reschedule. vCITA solves a huge administrative problem for me and keeps me sane as I juggle all of my roles and workload while providing excellent care to my clients.",

I know, because I have built a few businesses from the ground up and vCita has been my go to tool for a long time. \n\nIs it perfect, no, but from experience I can say that no tool is. What makes this product shine is the ease of use, for you the owner and for clients. It’s also extremely flexible with the ability to customize everything. With a little help from a seasoned pro, this tool can do anything from scheduling, reminders, payments and my favorite is the ability to integrate with Zapier - that’s when the real fun starts since you can share information between vCita and apps like QuickBooks, ship-station and so on. Ohh, the client portal is a sweet new bonus feature! \n\nvCita is well worth the expense, in my professional opinion. \n\nThank you. \n\nSteve Madar - CEO\n@ Get Better Clicks\nAds | Automation | Consultations",

      "# [How to avoid common email marketing mistakes by Michael Henson, Content on 2024-01-09](https://www.vcita.com/blog/small-business-marketing/avoid-email-marketing-mistakes)\nHave you ever spent hours crafting the perfect marketing email, only to have it land with a thud in subscribers’ inboxes? We’ve all been there, and we know how much it hurts. You might pour your heart and soul into connecting with your customers, but email marketing mistakes can undermine your hard work.\n\nSending emails at the wrong time, using broken links, boring subject lines, or unclear calls to action, and forgetting to segment email messaging are common email marketing mistakes that tank open and click through rates. The good news is that you can avoid these errors and see your email marketing strategy drive success for every campaign.\n\nKeep reading to make sure your subscribers actually open and click through the next email you send.\n\nSending emails at the wrong time\n\nMost small business owners don’t realize that the days and times you send your marketing emails can significantly impact whether people open and engage with them. After all, the average open rate for emails is only 21.33%, and the average click-through rate is just 2.72%. Unless you get the timing right, you could be seeing rates significantly lower than average.\n\nGet your email timing right\n\nTo beat these averages, avoid sending campaigns on Saturday mornings or Sunday nights. Open and click-through rates are lowest on weekends, especially Saturdays, when people are less likely to check their inboxes or have time to read your email.\n\nInstead, aim for Tuesday through Thursday between 9 AM and 3 PM. These times and days typically see the highest open and click-through rates, because people are settling into their workday, checking emails, and more receptive to reading and taking action on the messages in their inboxes.\n\nTest and track engagement rates\n\nThe thing about averages is that they are just that — averages. They don’t tell you the best timing for your specific audience. The only way to know for sure what works best for your particular email list and business is to test different days and times, and monitor the results.\n\nTry sending half your list an email on Tuesday morning, and the other half on Saturday afternoon. Compare the open and click-through rates to see which time period results in better engagement, then use that data to plan future email marketing campaigns.\n\nBroken links and missing alt text\n\nOne of the biggest email marketing mistakes small business owners make is including broken links or forgetting alt text in their email campaigns.\n\nThe irritation of broken links\n\nBroken links are links that don’t work for some reason, like the page was moved or deleted, or you made a minor typo when you added the link. It’s frustrating to click a broken link, and it ruins user experience. It also hurts your open and click through rates, causing your email marketing metrics to suffer.\n\nTo avoid using broken links, double check that all links in your email work before sending. Also, consider using a link checker tool to scan for and fix any broken links.\n\nThe frustration of missing alt text\n\nAnother common mistake is forgetting to add alt text to images in your emails. Alt text is the text that appears when an image won’t load for some reason. It provides context for the image so subscribers still get the message.\n\nWithout alt text, your subscribers are left with gaps in the content and a poor user experience if images are disabled or won’t load for any reason. To add alt text, go into the code for your email and add the alt attribute to all tags, describing the image for context.\n\nBy avoiding these two common email marketing mistakes, you’ll provide a much better experience for your subscribers. They’ll appreciate your attention to detail, continue engaging with your content, and stay on your email list, which is the goal of any successful email marketing strategy.\n\nVague subject lines\n\nIf recipients can’t determine what your email is about from the subject line, the odds of them opening and reading your email drop significantly. This makes it imperative to keep subject lines appealing and very clear. Here are some tips to make sure your subject lines pass the open test.\n\nKeep subject lines short and descriptive\n\nSubject lines of under 50 characters tend to have the highest open rates. Aim for a subject line that gives readers a quick hint about your email’s content or purpose. For example, “New Product Launch!” or “25% Off Spring Sale!” are short but compelling subject lines.\n\nAvoid overly broad subject lines like “Important Update” or “Monthly Newsletter.” These don’t give readers a reason to open your email. Similarly, avoid cryptic subject lines that don’t relate to your business or industry.\n\nMatch the subject line to the email content\n\nMake sure your email content aligns with the promise made in the subject line. If readers open your email expecting details on a new product launch or sale, but the content is a generic newsletter, they will feel misled. This damages your credibility and trustworthiness, leading readers to ignore future emails.\n\nTest different subject lines\n\nUse A/B testing to determine which subject lines resonate most with your readers. For example, send half your list an email with the subject “25% Off Your Next Order!” and the other half the same email with the subject “Huge Savings Inside!” A/B testing has been found to drive 28% higher ROI, so track open and click-through rates to see which email was more compelling, and apply these insights to optimize future subject lines.\n\nFailing to segment your email list\n\nWhen you send the same email to your entire list, you diminish engagement and hurt your open and click through rates. Segmenting your email list into smaller, targeted groups allows you to send the right message to the right people at the right time, which improves engagement and ensures more personalized communication. For example, don’t send an email announcing a sale on women’s clothing to men on your list.\n\nSegment by gender, location, purchase history, and more. You should also use email engagement metrics such as open and click through rates to understand how to best segment your email lists. If certain segments of your list have higher open or click through rates, focus your messaging on those groups. You’ll get a higher return on investment.\n\nForgetting a strong call to action\n\nWithout a clear call to action, or CTA, your readers won’t know what you want them to do next or how to engage further with your business. This results in lower click through rates, which hurts your email marketing strategy. Here are top tips for improving your CTAs.\n\nMake your CTA clear\n\nWhen crafting your marketing emails, be sure to include an obvious call to action that tells your readers exactly what you want them to do. Weak language like “Check it out!” or “Learn more” is too vague and won’t drive many conversions. On the other hand, a specific CTA like “Sign up for a free trial today!” or “Register now and save 25%!” gives readers a concrete next step.\n\nEnsure your CTA is easy to spot\n\nKeep your CTA highly visible by placing it prominently at the top and bottom of your email. You can also use action buttons, bold text, or contrasting colors to make it stand out. Only include one or two CTAs per email so you don’t overwhelm your readers or make them unsure of which action is most important.\n\nMonitor and refine your CTAs\n\nOnce your campaign is live, track how people are interacting with your CTA. Check your email analytics to see open and click through rates for each CTA option. Look for any differences between mobile and desktop, A/B test different CTAs or placements, and make changes as needed to optimize engagement. Little improvements to your calls to action can have a big impact on your email marketing success.\n\nTurn your emails into marketing magic\n\nLearn from your email marketing mistakes and use that knowledge to strengthen your future campaigns. Pay close attention to details like optimized subject lines, strategic send times, working links, and CTAs that get people to open your email and actually take the action you want them to. Small tweaks and consistent testing will help you avoid common errors, optimize your email strategy, and engage your list with relevant, value-added emails. You’ll boost your open and click through rates in no time and see increased conversions and sales that help your business grow.",

      "# [Vodafone Business boosts digital productivity for smaller businesses in partnership with vcita](https://www.vodafone.com/news/technology/vodafone-business-boosts-digital-productivity-for-smaller-businesses-in-partnership-with-vcita)\nVodafone Business is helping small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) effectively compete with their larger competitors by offering a secure and affordable productivity app in partnership with leading business management software provider vcita.

The app is especially designed to help small businesses with limited resources cost-effectively digitalise key tasks whilst managing and growing their customer base.\n\nGiorgio Migliarina, Interim CEO of Vodafone Business, said: “Vodafone Business’ goal is to become the trusted partner for all companies, both small and large, on their digital journey. Our partnership with vcita is part of our investment in the development of software, cloud, and cyber security products specifically for SMEs who are key to the future prosperity of our economies.”\n\n“We are thrilled to be partnering with Vodafone on a global level,” said Itzik Levy, CEO and Founder of vcita. “With Vodafone Business Management tool with vcita, Vodafone goes beyond the traditional role of a telecommunications provider and offers SMEs the ultimate digital business management solution that is critical to their success.

      "# [Vcita Parting Ways with e-Signature Acquisition WiseStamp by Charles Laughlin on 2024-01-04](https://www.localogy.com/2024/01/vcita-parting-ways-with-e-signature-acquisition-wisestamp/)\nSometimes relationships come to an end when the parties involved drift off in different directions. And they just don’t make sense together anymore.\n\nYou’re a little bit enterprise. I’m a little bit SMB.\n\nThis is essentially what happened between SMB SaaS player vcita and the e-signature company WiseStamp, which vcita acquired in 2019.\n\nThis week vcita announced a “strategic shift” via which the two companies will pursue independent growth strategies. That means vcita is spinning out WiseStamp as an independent company.\n\nThe reason for the split seems to be pretty straightforward. The two entities are pursuing very different market opportunities.\n\nWiseStamp sees its biggest opportunity in the enterprise world. And vcita is aimed squarely at servicing SMBs via partnerships. It recently launched a new platform for partners called InTandem.\n\nWe recently had vcita’s Founder and CEO Itzik Levy on our This Week in Local podcast, and he spoke at length about the nuances of building SaaS software for SMBs.\n\nIt’s Better for Both of us\n\nAnd of course, the two organizations’ leaders spun the spin-off as better for both parties.\n\n“The time has come for WiseStamp to step out on its own and fully embrace the opportunities we see in the enterprise market,” said Ehud Yalin-Mor, CEO of WiseStamp.\n\n“The learnings and expertise gained during our time with vcita have been invaluable. And they will continue to serve us well as we take this next step on our journey. We are grateful for the partnership and support we have received, and we look forward to maintaining a strong relationship with vcita as we both continue to grow and thrive.”\n\nEp. 39 Dives into SMB SaaS with vcita CEO Itzik Levy\n\nAnd vcita’s Levy offered his well wishes.\n\n“We are incredibly proud of what we have achieved together with WiseStamp, and we are excited about their next chapter,” Levy said.\n\n“WiseStamp has a unique and innovative solution. And we are confident they will continue to achieve great things as an independent company. We remain connected by our shared values and commitment to delivering top-of-the-line digital solutions, and we wish them all the best in their future endeavors.”",

      "# [How Organizations Serving SMBs Can Assist AI Adoption by Liat Zohar on 2024-08-22](https://www.cloud-awards.com/how-organizations-serving-smbs-can-assist-ai-adoption)\nBy Liat Zohar, Chief Marketing Officer at vcita. vcita won the ‘Best SaaS Product for Small Business / SMEs‘ category at The 2024 SaaS Awards.\n\nOrganizations that offer services to SMBs – such as telcos, banks, and marketing agencies – are constantly looking for ways to expand what they can offer to their SMB clients.\n\nFor instance, telcos today can’t merely offer phone or internet service. If they want to ensure they retain and gain SMB clients, they need to provide offerings that go above and beyond and provide tangible value to SMBs – namely, digital tools built on the most advanced technologies that can help SMBs run their business.\n\nIn today’s era of artificial intelligence, that means offering SMBs AI business management tools.\n\nAlthough SMB are increasingly interested in AI – a recent survey found that 85% of SMBs are enthusiastic about using AI – there are still struggles when it comes to adoption. This is largely due to the fact that SMBs – especially solopreneurs and micro businesses – don’t always have the time, manpower, money, or technological prowess to devote to learning how to use these tools. According to recent research, the top concerns small businesses have about AI are data security, perceived cost, and learning curve.\n\nWhile it is clear that organizations which service SMBs can – and should – invest in developing promising AI solutions, there is no guarantee they will be adopted. Indeed, countless hours of building a tool will be futile if these enterprises don’t figure out ways to help SMBs integrate them into their daily business operations.\n\nHere’s how they can help SMBs adopt AI tools into their daily business operations.\n\nTailoring AI Solutions for SMBs\n\nUnlike large enterprises, SMBs have limited resources, manpower and technical expertise – consider that the majority of SMBs in the U.S. operate without any employees. As such, tools designed for large enterprises may be too complex, expensive, and resource-intensive, making them impractical for SMBs.\n\nOne approach is to craft tools specifically tailored to the unique needs of SMBs. AI has often been branded as a monolithic, fix-it-all tool. However different AI models exist for different goals and are trained towards specific purposes. To effectively serve SMBs, it is crucial to develop AI stools that are not only specialized but also built upon a thorough understanding of the SMBs’ industry, environment, and specific business data. It is no longer enough to offer a generic AI tool – these services must be built and trained to serve the needs of SMBs.\n\nAnother approach is to think of use cases where AI helps SMB with tasks that are mission critical. The current landscape of AI SMB tools includes many apps that offer content generation for marketing purposes, an essential service for SMBs. But this is just the beginning of what AI can do. Companies should additionally deliver solutions that leverage AI beyond content generation, empowering SMBs to fully leverage the power of AI. Ideally, companies should offer AI tools that act as a business advisor for SMBs, providing strategic insights and decision support to enhance their operations.\n\nBy offering solutions customized for SMBs, organizations can ensure that AI technologies are accessible, user-friendly, don’t require major investment in data input, and are aligned with the scale of SMB operations.\n\nProviding Intuitive, Easy-to-Use AI Tools\n\nSMBs are often strapped for time, and many don’t have IT teams, so ease of use is one of the most important aspects of encouraging them to integrate AI. In fact, nearly half of all SMBs lack a full-time IT employee.\n\nAI tools designed for SMBs must prioritize a simple, intuitive UX to ensure adoption. This will minimize the learning curve, allowing SMBs to quickly understand the tool’s functionalities without extensive training.\n\nOne of the most difficult aspects of using an AI tool is figuring out how to best prompt it. One of the basic principles of generative AI is that the quality of output is linked directly to the quality of the input. If prompts are lacking and nonspecific, the answers will be too. To make the most of AI, SMBs need inspiration and examples of what good prompts should look like. AI tools for SMBs should include examples and prompt templates they can use.\n\nIn addition, like any tool built for SMBs, AI tools should aim to minimize the need for manual data entry. This can be challenging since AI needs to learn and ask questions before it can provide value. However, companies should still strive to offer AI applications that are already linked to a source of data, allowing the AI to use this data to optimize the output.\n\nFinally, some SMBs might not even realize the situations where AI can help them in the first place. Organizations should therefore offer AI tools that can be embedded into already existing platforms and will pop up when relevant. For example, if an SMB owner is drafting a business plan for a new service, imagine if an AI advisor then pops up to suggest pricing plans relative to other market offerings. As opposed to them having to seek out AI, which might not come intuitively to all SMB owners, the AI comes to them.\n\nOffering Training and Support\n\nOrganizations should also offer training programs and ongoing support for SMBs to make sure they’re using AI tools effectively – indeed, only 46% of SMBs say they have only a beginner’s understanding of the benefits of using AI for their business. This will ensure that SMBs have access to assistance when encountering challenges or seeking optimization opportunities.\n\nOrganizations can also create a community where SMBs can connect, share experiences, and learn from each other. They can facilitate networking events, online forums, and peer-to-peer learning sessions where SMBs can discuss challenges, strategies, and successes related to AI adoption. This commitment to education and support not only enhances customer satisfaction but fosters long-term relationships as well, driving loyalty towards the organization.\n\nSupporting SMBs Into the AI Future\n\nIn today’s competitive landscape, organizations that serve SMBs need to do everything in their power to retain their clientele – offering AI business management solutions is an easy way to do so.\n\nBut these organizations would do well to recognize that simply offering AI tools is not enough; they must actively support SMBs in their adoption journey. They should encourage a mindset of innovation and adaptation and help SMBs understand that AI isn’t replacing them – rather it’s helping them run the daily operations of their business so they can focus on what they love most – the business itself.",
