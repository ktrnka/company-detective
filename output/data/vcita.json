A booking requires payment before the booking goes through, and I only accept payments through PayPal.\n\nA client booked a consultation and then immediately sent me a message saying they wanted to cancel.  I refunded their payment.\n\nThey have since kept contacting me saying they didn't receive the refund.  I sent them a screenshot from PayPal showing the refund.  The person contacting me is identifying themselves as an \"Administrator\" and is someone different than the person who booked the call.\n\nThey said they paid through Venmo--I'm not even sure if that's possible with Vcita and/or PayPal, but whatever, on my end it's a PayPal payment and I refunded it, so I'm done.\n\nThere is absolutely zero chance that I send them money any other way, so their scam won't succeed.\n\nBut it seems like about the stupidest scam ever.  They actually sent me money through PayPal--I don't think there's a way for them to book without sending me money.  So the scam would have the risk that some people don't refund their original payment.\n\nThis is my first one of these in about 6 years of booking consultations this way.\n\nThoughts?\n\n## Comment ID ijmxllo with +18 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-08-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/taxpros/comments/wkbna1/weird_potential_scam/ijmxllo/) (in reply to ID wkbna1):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID ijmzwqr with +7 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-08-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/taxpros/comments/wkbna1/weird_potential_scam/ijmzwqr/) (in reply to ID ijmxllo):\n>They probably paid with stolen PayPal credentials or with a stolen credit card via PayPal.\n\nAh, makes sense, that explains it.\n\n## Comment ID ijohjuh with +2 score by [(attosec, Reddit, 2022-08-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/taxpros/comments/wkbna1/weird_potential_scam/ijohjuh/) (in reply to ID wkbna1):\nYou wrote “I refunded their payment”.

I sell Pipedrive, and implement it for free. I also implement the others on the list.\n\nIf it’s not one of the above, I don’t bother. I’ve got a list of more than 35 platforms that call themselves CRMs and I’ve been disappointed by every single one I’ve evaluated outside of the four mentioned. You would have to explain to me why you think it might be a better option. For example, Monday isn’t a CRM at all - it’s just got some CRM functionality but I’ve never migrated a client TO Monday, only FROM Monday (and other so-called CRMs).\n\nSidenote: if you don’t have a good sales process, no CRM can save you. I don’t have to train people on Pipedrive if they already knowsales. What I spend my time on more thananything is process; if people know what to do in sales, it’s easier for them to figure out how to do it in a CRM.\n\n### Comment ID meni4xd with +1 score by [(magic_turk, Reddit, 2025-02-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CRM/comments/1hb0jrt/which_crm_would_you_recommend/meni4xd/) (in reply to ID m1f76vj):\nI am looking to make the switch over from Hubspot.

Car insurance for any business vehicles (separate plan to personal cars), and renters/premises/stock insurance may be applicable as well. You probably don't need cybersecurity insurance or anything too niche. \n\nWhen I was looking into this I hung around the /r/insurance subreddit, and then eventually spoke to a broker. Don't go to a broker before knowing the basics, as it's possible that they'll take you for a ride. VCita is hosting a webinar on AtoZ insurance for small businesses that you might like to attend, I've been to a few past ones of theirs and they're very informative: https://landing.vcita.com/insurance-for-smbs\n\nAdditionally, ask your network for advice on which broker to choose, after you know what you want.

Then once you're covered, that can include liability, insurance for your office location/shop, as well as company vehicles. The business policy will cover operations in the field. \n\nAs a contractor you typically get bonded in each respective city that you do business and these expire annually these you submit each city with your contractor registration. Bonds are $100 each and I pay my agent for them. They send the bond directly to the municipality on my behalf.\n\nFor research go to your market's building department website to download a contractor registration packet so you know what the city expects of you. Agents will be familiar with these requirements.\n\nFortunately these registrations happen annually and in conjunction with permits but you may not need permits to do repairs, only new construction.

Often the difference between 1 and 2 million of coverage is just asking. (You can get the larger amount for the same price, 1 mil, is often a minimum premium policy and upping it to two doesn’t cost you anything. \n\nYou should never pay for COIs. Your agent should send these to whomever, for free, it’s their job. \n\nAs far as other products, their is product liability if you make a good; businesses personal property (the stuff you use to run business, tools, machines, etc...)...auto, work comp...  those are pretty standard per industry though (state board sets those). \n\nMore importantly; shop. Find an agent that can offer the most for less. Agents have credits they can apply to policies to get your business (make your premium cost less)... make them work for it. About 60 days prior to renewal, your agent should be calling.

What are your favorite platforms as a tutor? with +16 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-03-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/tutor/comments/tjebc1/is_wyzant_a_good_platform_for_tutors_what_are/)\n I'm getting into CS tutoring and I'm wondering if Wyzant is good. I'm also looking at Course Hero but it sounds like it's probably a miss (low pay, lots of negative opinions out there). Any other platforms you would recommend or dis-recommend as a tutor?\n\n## Comment ID i1jlfgr with +12 score by [(axiom_tutor, Reddit, 2022-03-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/tutor/comments/tjebc1/is_wyzant_a_good_platform_for_tutors_what_are/i1jlfgr/) (in reply to ID tjebc1):\nWyzAnt takes an absolutely gigantic cut of your pay (25%).  So to make the rate you're hoping to, you have to set your rate very high.  \n\nWyzAnt also says that they have an online platform for meetings, with a whiteboard and shared text editor.  But the whiteboard is buggy as hell and none of its solutions is better than the alternatives for online meetings.  I use Vibe and screen sharing through Zoom or whatever, even when I connect with students on WyzAnt.  \n\nThe thing that WyzAnt offers is a secured rating system, a payment system, and advertising.  WyzAnt comes up first in most searches for online tutoring, so you're going to get your \"cold contacts\" (i.e. people not referred to you through other connections) that way.  Also you can be sure you won't get someone who refuses to pay for the meeting because you can bill them.  Also, and this really important, nobody can rate you who hasn't met with you.  In any other system where someone can rate you without hiring you, there will always be some tutor who is competing with you and will negatively rate you so that they relatively advance in the rating system.  \n\nSo WyzAnt kinda sucks but you're missing out if you don't list yourself there.  It's the way of the world right now.  \n\nThe bonus is that it's free to put a profile on there, and the background check is cheap, so why not just do it?\n\nI would say likewise, just throw a profile on every other free site.  Why not?  But as far as I know there is no \"good\" online tutoring platform.  If they put any money into being highly placed in Google search returns, they don't pay you hardly anything.\n\n### Comment ID ikr3hxr with +9 score by [(AppointmentFun7525, Reddit, 2022-08-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/tutor/comments/tjebc1/is_wyzant_a_good_platform_for_tutors_what_are/ikr3hxr/) (in reply to ID i1jlfgr):\n25% cut is nothing, especially with the nationwide marketing and access to clientele you get through WyzAnt. I’m curious to know which companies let you keep 80% or more? \nMost local tutoring companies take half or more. I get $40-50/ hour for $80-$100 sessions with small local companies.  Princeton Review paid me $23/hour for private tutoring while pocketing $114. You can absolutely keep more percentage by going out on your own, but you need to have enough traffic on your site to make it worth it.\nPersonally, I’m happy to pay the 25% for marketing, scheduling, posting testimonials and ratings, allowing me to charge for last minute cancellations, and saving me the time to “convince” each and every new client that I’m worth the money. \nWyzAnt also keeps excellent track of lessons and finances which is a huge help for taxes and loan applications. It’s like paying an office assistant to do all that for me, and I’m okay with that. \nAgain, I would like to know which companies are letting you keep more than $80 because I will gladly switch if the services are comparable!\n\n#### Comment ID iky1l5z with +1 score by [(axiom_tutor, Reddit, 2022-08-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/tutor/comments/tjebc1/is_wyzant_a_good_platform_for_tutors_what_are/iky1l5z/) (in reply to ID ikr3hxr):\n25% is definitely something.  Sure, there is a justification for taking a percentage, and getting top placement in search results isn't easy.  But 25% is pretty borderline insane, and I would not at all characterize my attitude toward it as happy.  10-15% would make me happy--I'd believe that that much is necessary for SEO, a webdev team, and management overhead.  But there is definitely some point at which I believe this is just them getting away with an outsized rate because they know they can get away with it, and 25% is in the neighborhood for me.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, I still do it, and just post an insanely inflated rate that relatively few people are willing to pay so that I get a reasonable rate.  And I sometimes get work that way.  But I also certainly look for ways around the trap too.\n\n### Comment ID i1jpmt7 with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-03-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/tutor/comments/tjebc1/is_wyzant_a_good_platform_for_tutors_what_are/i1jpmt7/) (in reply to ID i1jlfgr):\nThanks!

It does have some advantages (some marketing for you, you set your own rates, and they do all the collections). However, as the other comments have mentioned, that 25% cut is way too big. \n\nI ended up creating my own website and using a company called vCita as my backend. vCita takes care of bookings, collections, etc., but they only have an annual fee that's very affordable. The key is to make your website easy to book from. I'm a Finance/Accounting/Economics tutor, so if I can build my own website and link it to vCita, I'm sure you as a CS tutor could do it.

When a customer books via the flow, you can require them to put down a 50 cent credit card hold and it saves their card on Stripe so you can charge a cancellation fee later.\n\nSo it's perfect for service businesses such as auto detail or hair salons that don't want random people to occupy booking slots and not show up.

And those types of leads are a lot easier to close because you’ve been referred. But a business should not rely on just word of mouth only. The most valuable business that build value and make it easy to sell have a proven lead generating strategy. A business that has a website and other digital assets that has a consistent flow of leads through multiple lead streams will sell for a lot more money than one that just relies on word of mouth. We also help businesses build value and prepare owners that might one day pass on the business to children, their employees or sell out to retire. \nOwners that pass their business to children or employees often find themselves financing part of the business by taking a portion of the business’s profits every year. If you do that you definitely want to make sure that business has a well thought out lead generation strategy.\nBest wishes!\n\n## Comment ID ga5xl6f with +5 score by [(onions-make-me-cry, Reddit, 2020-10-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/jicl2v/how_does_a_local_service_business_generate_leads/ga5xl6f/) (in reply to ID jicl2v):\nHey OP...

Have a Facebook page for your business.\n4. Get active in local Facebook groups. Make a generic poster for the kind of services you provide along with contact information. Post it bi-weekly in all the local Facebook groups.\n5. If you have a budget, Get a website and do local SEO. I would strongly advise, using voice searches term. Also, If there is any other language your core customers use, consider SEO of those terms as well. \n6. If you have a budget, Run Facebook ads and google ads.

But mostly I use my content feed to tease projects and create content for my clients to use to build their respective client bases, benefitting me in the long run. \n\nFor example, I posted some detail shots of a project I’m about to complete, tagged the materials vendor and my client. My client was able to share the pics with her client as a fun status update, and I received 2 inquiries off her feed from other designers I’ve been wanting to work with for years. On another pic of a recently completed project, I had 3-4 of my client’s clients engage with the post, which in turn gave my clients the opportunity to sell this particular type of project to the end user that they otherwise wouldn’t have had. Other posts are used to educate the consumer base: time lapse videos of construction, demos of the equipment we use to make our products, etc. Consumers are very uneducated about custom manufacturing, so putting a human face and demonstrating the time and labor it takes to make our products goes a long way to minimize the sticker shock of our quotes. \n\nI know I’m approaching social media in a very strange way, but I gotta say it’s working for me.\n\n### Comment ID kgz6987 with +1 score by [(Local-Growth-Experts, Reddit, 2024-01-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/jicl2v/how_does_a_local_service_business_generate_leads/kgz6987/) (in reply to ID ga63exn):\nWhat type of business?

It's far too 'culty' for me.

They used the most obvious hard pressure tactics in the book, the sort that no actually successful business has used since the 90s.  Looking into their backgrounds and client lists (publicly available via their shitty websites that hadn't been updated in 10 years), they were average salesmen at best during their careers and now strongarm businesses in dying industries run by fucking idiots into buying their \"5/7/9/15 step programme to sales success\" \n\nI was a member for about 6 months but refused to turn up again after one local business owner kept getting shit for not referring enough businesses, despite using another BNI member to build a £600k oak framed building.  Yes, it was one referral, but it eclipsed the other referral values combined for the rest of the year.  Apparently, that didn't matter.\n\nI actually lost a client over it (he was one of the grandmasters or whatever they call themselves), but the time I gained by not coming up with bullshit referrals and pushing people I shouldn't into rubbish meetings more than made up for the loss.

Google my business is free and easy. Facebook is too. Websites cost a couple hundred bucks these days. Yelp is fucking bullshit. \n\nPaid search works if you know how to work it. There's a lot of PPC snake oil salesmen out there but also good ones and there's a bunch of articles on how to tell the difference. I'd have an expert do it rather than try it and not perform well. \n\nMany service companies will partner with lead generation companies: they're great at getting phone calls that they can pass to you but aren't electricians or whatever. It's nice to use them because it's one less thing you need to worry about but they do take a piece of the pie and you don't have as much control over how you're presented or what calls you get, and have no opportunity to build a brand. \n\nThere's other methods that work. If you work on their property and do work that is visible, see if you can put up $10 yards signs so their neighbors can call you. Someone gave out $500 in lotto scratchers and got $14,000 in work from it. I gave out $50 gift cards to people that referred clients and got 2-3 more usually. \n\nMost importantly though: whenever you get a new customer ask them 1) how did you hear about us 2) what made you choose us.

Google My Business (GMB)\n\n* **Set Up and Optimize**: Make sure your GMB profile is fully set up with all your business details, operating hours, and high-quality photos.\n* **Regular Updates**: Post updates, photos, and special offers regularly to keep your profile active.\n* **Encourage Reviews**: Ask satisfied customers to leave positive reviews, which can significantly boost your visibility and credibility.\n\n# 2. Local SEO\n\n* **Optimize Your Website**: Make sure your website is optimized for local searches. Include local keywords and create content around them.\n* **Create Location-Specific Pages**: If you serve multiple areas, create dedicated pages for each location with relevant keywords.\n* **Backlinks**: Get listed on local directories and engage in local community activities to earn backlinks.\n\n# 3. Social Media\n\n* **Engage with the Community**: Join local groups on Facebook, Nextdoor, and other platforms to engage with potential customers.\n* **Share Valuable Content**: Post regularly about your services, share tips related to your industry, and showcase customer testimonials.\n* **Run Local Ads**: Facebook and Instagram ads targeted to your local area can be very effective.\n\n# 4. Content Marketing\n\n* **Blog Posts**: Write blog posts that address common questions and issues related to your services. This can help attract organic traffic.\n* **Videos**: Create videos showcasing your work, customer testimonials, and behind-the-scenes looks at your business.\n\n# 5. Lead Scraping with Google Maps\n\n* **Find Leads**: Use Google Maps to search for businesses \"Near Me\" and collect their details.\n* **Gather Information**: Note down contact numbers, email addresses, and website links.\n* **Analyze and Target**: Identify high-value targets and assess their online presence to see where you can offer value.\n\nIf you'd like to watch a detailed YouTube video on how I scrape leads using Google Maps and other strategies, DM me and I'll send you the link.\n\n## Comment ID lk4zror with +1 score by [(TotalPeachCase, Reddit, 2024-08-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/jicl2v/how_does_a_local_service_business_generate_leads/lk4zror/) (in reply to ID jicl2v):\nwww.market-monster.com helps roofers and contractors… well any service based business.

First, get a solid website up and optimize it for local SEO so folks can find you when they're searching. Using social media to show off your work is super important those before and after photos really catch attention. You should also think about running targeted ads and using mailsAI to follow up with leads from inquiries.  \n  \nBuilding an email list for promotions and updates helps keep your business fresh in people's minds.

I advise once you work on your online presence, you have someone monitor and respond to reviews, comments, and interact with your customers.  The idea is, a lot is online now and customers love giving reviews. Potential customers look for reviews too before reaching out. The more you respond, the more they get a feel for your company.

Like, I need the tile behind by bathroom tub redone because I was scammed by a Craigslist tile guy who got called to another job and got his 'friend' who never did tile before to totally fuck my shit up. I was out of town, and now I have to pay double to get it redone. \n\nSo, how does one overcome the fear people have hiring the 'right person' for the job? \n\nThe thing I want to see is photos of completed jobs that look almost exactly like mine. I want to see even tile, straight lines, nice cut tile that is symmetrical and not chipped, crooked, or janky. Photos that are high quality, but here is the thing. They can't be stock-photo quality, but can't be piss poor flash in the image quality. Also, having a person holding a sign, or a sign in the shot that isn't photoshopped in with the company name on it, means it is most likely real photos. So that shows they are experienced.\n\nThe next thing is, if I am about to spend $1k-$5k, what kind of testimonials are there? Are they fake or real? A real one would have both a negative and a positive, with the negative being not so bad. Fake ones are like those crazy over the top with words like 'perfect' 'amazing' 'wonderful' and stuff that is clearly orgasmic with the verbiage. It sounds like an Amazon review for a Chinese product because it can do everything like cure cancer from having tile put in. Yea, skip that guy. Look for real reviews.\n\nWhat other fears are out there? What does the owner look like? Is there a photo of him? Does he look like Mr. Burns from the Simpsons, or does he look like George Clooney? I feel more trustful from George than Mr. Burns with that shady eye evil grin. I also want to speak to the owner and get at least a verbal guarantee that the job will be done right and not half assed. \n\nLastly, and this is a big one: respect of my home, and clean up. Will they wear booties? Will they be gentile in my open areas with tools and not scuff my hall walls coming down it with a bucket of grout? Will they wear booties, and not stink like booze? Are their hoodies clean or are they pit-stained like they came from a homeless shelter? \n\nI think when you market ANY service, you have to overcome the fears that people have and their objections and also sound at least, reasonable. Most of us don't mind paying a 'fair price' for a 'good job' but when you have the 'new guy' doing your job wrong, the owner has two choices: fix it, or lie and scam. So making sure your advertising is reflective of overcoming 'no' and the fears, means your campaign is going to hit better when it lands in my inbox or in a flyer.\n\n## Comment ID ga9a1nu with +1 score by [(mrmetis, Reddit, 2020-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/jicl2v/how_does_a_local_service_business_generate_leads/ga9a1nu/) (in reply to ID jicl2v):\nit has variations but we can say inbound and outbound. I suggest inbound where customers look for you. so you create local address included content related to your products, where people can continue asking or researching your service. in there they will be giving out their information from your landing page. \n\n\n\nafter they become leads you can categorize them waiting, contacted once, rejected, agreed etc. cold calls email but critical virtue is ''follow up''. if you pay for ads it can help but it should be designed different.\n\n\n\nI would also suggest creating a blog for long term exposure and creating an ''authority image'' in the industry but since I dont know what you exactly do, I dont know if this is a good option for you.\n\n\ngood luck.\n\n## Comment ID ga9ynsg with +1 score by [(Unemployed20, Reddit, 2020-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/jicl2v/how_does_a_local_service_business_generate_leads/ga9ynsg/) (in reply to ID jicl2v):\nHey man,\n\nWill avoid any woo-woo MLM psychology shit here (ABC, etc.) and will go straight to the nitty gritty of low-cost/highly effective lead gen.\n\nA bit about myself, I run a B2B Lead Gen team and several growth hacking communities across Whatsapp & Facebook.\n\nSo we will start of with email:\n\nIf you're servicing other businesses (hence B2B), you can simply scrape facebook's business page directory ([www.facebook.com/pages/category](http://www.facebook(.)com/pages/category)) for the exact business category you're scraping and go further down by location.\n\nI show how to do this right here: [https://youtu.be/KxF7yWDoqvM](https://youtu.be/KxF7yWDoqvM)\n\nLinkedin:\n\nLinkedin can also serve as an awesome B2B lead generation channel, especially locally, considering that you're able to run a search based on exact location & industry. This works best for white-collar businesses but can also yield results for the lesser complex service lines.\n\nFacebook:\n\nFor the B2C aspect of things, hence, finding houses to paint, cars to fix, etc. I'd strongly recommend Facebook or Instagram Ads. Test with small budgets and then double down budget wise on the ad sets that work best. Make sure to use Facebook's Ad Library to actually spy on your competition and get a good idea on which ads are performing well and which ads are not. Use Facebook to reach an older demographic, and use Instagram to reach your location's younger demographic.\n\nAdditionally note that from a B2B perspective, you can also scrape local small business owner groups within your region, save the profile URLs and then use a tool like Texau to outreach to 30 of them automatically per day. (More grey hat but super do-able)\n\nContent:\n\nSEO is super competitive, especially with keywords like \"Plumber near me\" or \"Mechanic near me\", but Youtube's SEO is much much more easier to dominate. This is exactly why I always recommend that \"long-sighted\" businesses actually take the time to create service-related content as it can drastically improve your deal flow in the long run. Much less of an upfront $$$ investment, but more of a time investment with crazy results.\n\nHope this helped.\n\nThose are my ideas from the top of my head, without looking at your site/url.\n\nIf you have more questions, DM.\n\n## Comment ID k8z6vjv with +1 score by [(Proof_Title116, Reddit, 2023-11-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/jicl2v/how_does_a_local_service_business_generate_leads/k8z6vjv/) (in reply to ID jicl2v):\nVery old thread, but I wanted to chime in on the topic. \n\nYou would not believe how many established companies don’t market to their email lists. \n\nNo matter what business you’re in - physical location, web-based, service, B2B/c - your email list should be top of mind and integrated properly into every single marketing effort (ppc, mailers, tv, web and print).\n\nI be happy to answer questions (if there are any) related to email marketing.\n\n## Comment ID kcypl8v with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-12-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/jicl2v/how_does_a_local_service_business_generate_leads/kcypl8v/) (in reply to ID jicl2v):\nRelevant? https://101databroker.com/generating-leads-for-small-businesses/\n\n## Comment ID kgz4i75 with +1 score by [(Local-Growth-Experts, Reddit, 2024-01-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/jicl2v/how_does_a_local_service_business_generate_leads/kgz4i75/) (in reply to ID jicl2v):\nThe most successful way to get local leads as a small local business is first get a website. It’s important when building a website that it’s built with getting local traffic in mind. Then build a GOOGLE Business Profile, and have it optimized for attracting local customers as well. Be sure to include optimized images in your website as well. It’s very important to make sure all of your business information NAP (Name, Address & Phone) are exactly the same as well as your hours of operation on both your GBP and your website. \n\nGoogle likes consistent information. Having the same information also builds trust and GOOGLE rewards websites it considers trustworthy. You should then Build citations (other mini type profiles that mainly consist of your NAP, brief description of your business and a few photos as well as your hours of business. \n\nThis and some other strategies can get even a new website to rank on the first page of Google within 30-90 days depending on location, niche (business type) and competition. Once your on the first page of Google other strategies are employed to maintain the position. There are only 10 organic spots available on a Google page. Statistics from a recent poll say that the first page of Google gets 87-95% of all website clicks for any given niche in any particular location. The second page drops drastically to less than 6%. So as the old saying goes…if you’re not First your last & this truly applies to being on google. \nOr you can also run Google campaigns for paid ads, facebook and instagram advertising. But when running paid advertising campaigns these should be well thought out campaigns as well. GOOD campaigns not only get you a ton of local business leads but the better your campaigns the cheaper your ad spend. \nA business should have a good strategy for getting a consistent flow of quality local leads in order to stay busy and grow its business. Stay away from lead generation sites that sell leads to multiple business at the same time. These leads are typically a waste of time and can really eat into profits. \nReach out for more local lead getting strategies!\nHope this helps some local small businesses!",

I was set up in the Business Center which I call forms for dummies.   After months of thinking they were advertising for me, I hadn't received any calls and upon opening up the website and looking at my company listed in yelp, etc., my address appeared on everything and I specifically said I did not want for it to be seen.  After months of calling and texting, I sent a text and I said Do Not Charge my debt card any more that you (Thryv) are not authorized to do so and any charges from this day forward will result in contacting the right authorities and pressing charges.    That got an immediate response.   They did not charge my card and I told her that i needed something to grow my business as I said when coming to Thryv.  She  said I ask for the Business Center package.   I said I did not I talked to a higher up because I saw her on facebook so I contacted her to ask if she could grow my business.   That is when I was thrown into tangled web of lies.    I found the email I sent to the higher up and it stated very clearly that it was to grow my business.    I am searching for all the texts I sent to the gal at Thryv that I still don't know what her title was, but Verizon is who I have to get them through.  \n\nso i have had an audit run of my website and, when coming to Thryv, I was told I would have more business than I could handle and we are google optimized.   Come to find out, no advertising was being done and there is no google analytics, google console or \"g\" tag on the backend of my website and nothing optimized with very little key words, etc.    Sad.......and now I have to keep my website there until my custom website is built.   They are charging me for an advertising package, which I did not ask for.   I guess I should let her know I won't pay the bill.

Put on paper all the tasks that need to be done. It will help you stay on top of it and will prevent procrastination. Do this for business and personal tasks.\n\nGoogle \"flow states\" and discover how to build focus and increase productivity. Deep concentration on a single task leads to greater efficiency and productivity in your work. There are numerous ways of training the brain to improve its ability to focus. If you google \"flow states\", you'll find numerous articles on the subject, and you can also train your mind to achieve flow states through various exercises, such as meditation, visualization, or journaling.\n\nConsume media that is relevant to your goals/objectives. That could be podcasts, books or webinars, there's a webinar from vCita on how to master time management that appears to align with your current objective: https://landing.vcita.com/time-management\n\nPlan your time ahead of time. I know exactly what I want to get done in a given day, week and month. This structure makes sure that I am spending time on the right things. I use google calendar to do this.\n\n### Comment ID h18rav1 with +7 score by [(retard_4725, Reddit, 2021-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/nw5wzu/how_do_you_manage_your_time_as_a_solopreneur/h18rav1/) (in reply to ID h17w17d):\nUnderrated comment. \n\nIf you read this thank you so much\n\n#### Comment ID h198gzc with +3 score by [(Dependent_Advisor, Reddit, 2021-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/nw5wzu/how_do_you_manage_your_time_as_a_solopreneur/h198gzc/) (in reply to ID h18rav1):\nYou are welcome!\n\n### Comment ID h19xzjo with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/nw5wzu/how_do_you_manage_your_time_as_a_solopreneur/h19xzjo/) (in reply to ID h17w17d):\nJust to touch on this great advice, my productivity shot up when I stopped giving myself generalized goals \"Need to get new leads\" and instead used much more focused verbage and timetables \"Need to reach out to 5 restaurant distributors by Wednesday\". That gives me much more direction and a harsher deadline. \n\nOne other thing I've done is learned to avoid what I call Schrodingers Task. In my case they're usually clients or projects that exist in limbo. Or realities that exist in limbo. I'll have a client for example who has a project that I'm not sure if they are serious about or not. Instead of just opening the box and seeing if it's real or not, I let it exist in a half way state for weeks or months because of the fear that it might not actually be anything at all. I used to do this as well with tasks that I feared were worse than they might be.

The more you schedule, the less you have to juggle. One way to start a routine is to identify and schedule any recurring tasks. What things do you do every day, week, etc.? These tend to be the business maintenance tasks. Schedule them so you don't think about them. Then plan the rest of your on-demand tasks of the day around that set schedule. Do you email clients every morning? Schedule it. Do you pay bills once a week? Set aside dedicated \"pay bills\" time on a specific day.\n\nThere are many time tracking and monitoring apps available. While I wouldn't recommend using monitoring apps for employees (either trust them or drop them), putting one on yourself will give you a real picture of how you're spending your time. Seeing how your day actually goes, instead of how you think it goes can be very eye-opening.\n\n## Comment ID h18buu1 with +1 score by [(Fatherof10, Reddit, 2021-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/nw5wzu/how_do_you_manage_your_time_as_a_solopreneur/h18buu1/) (in reply to ID nw5wzu):\nI have been doing this for a few years now and have built our company fairly large in that time all by myself.\n\n\nKinda like juggling the Urgent vs important \n\nPower list.\nhttps://andyfrisella.com/blogs/mfceo-project-podcast/kill-it-every-day-maximizing-productivity-with-andy-frisella-mfceo09\n\n## Comment ID h19eeax with +1 score by [(WeronikaBujnowska_, Reddit, 2021-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/nw5wzu/how_do_you_manage_your_time_as_a_solopreneur/h19eeax/) (in reply to ID nw5wzu):\nWhat works for me are lists and checklists! I also use time tracking tools such as forest or indy as well. Planning and not leaving tasks for later always work the best for me\n\n## Comment ID h19n87x with +1 score by [(eggie82, Reddit, 2021-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/nw5wzu/how_do_you_manage_your_time_as_a_solopreneur/h19n87x/) (in reply to ID nw5wzu):\nAlways have a plan of what you intend to accomplish at the start of the day so when you sit down you know what you need to focus on. I have found the Pomodoro technique to be quite helpful in staying motivated and on task. It can be a long and lonely day doing it on your own sometimes so I try to schedule at least one client meeting a day too for a bit of human contact.\n\n## Comment ID h19pu4m with +1 score by [(Dickincheeks, Reddit, 2021-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/nw5wzu/how_do_you_manage_your_time_as_a_solopreneur/h19pu4m/) (in reply to ID nw5wzu):\nStay organized and be realistic with what you can commit to. Make time for your personal tasks so you avoid dreading your work responsibilities. Idk what you mean by resources but I doubt you need a better tool or app, it sounds like you need to build better habits.\n\n## Comment ID h1a7zrt with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/nw5wzu/how_do_you_manage_your_time_as_a_solopreneur/h1a7zrt/) (in reply to ID nw5wzu):\nCharge more and then hire people to do the work for you.\n\n## Comment ID h1a9czo with +1 score by [(reineedshelp, Reddit, 2021-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/nw5wzu/how_do_you_manage_your_time_as_a_solopreneur/h1a9czo/) (in reply to ID nw5wzu):\nDelegate, outsource, automate\n\n## Comment ID h1acy4m with +1 score by [(Ask_Are_You_Okay, Reddit, 2021-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/nw5wzu/how_do_you_manage_your_time_as_a_solopreneur/h1acy4m/) (in reply to ID nw5wzu):\nIt's trite business advice, but consider reading *The E Myth*.\n\nWhat's also helped me is to apply my software development background and use tools like kanbans and change management on a very small scale to organize and prioritize tasks and changes to how we do business.\n\n\"You can't manage what you can't see\" and all that. This can be as easy as buying different color sticky notes and writing down all your tasks and organizing them on the wall. \n\nThen once you have a good idea of *what* you need to do *how* often becomes more visible. \n\n\"Follow the money!\" as they say. When you ask whether task A or B is more important, ask yourself which one will in the grand scheme of things earn more money or save more time.\n\nFWIW as you're discovering, I've found time is far more difficult to come by than money.\n\nWhat you choose *not* to do is as important as what you choose *to* do.\n\n## Comment ID h1bi6fe with +1 score by [(startsmallco, Reddit, 2021-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/nw5wzu/how_do_you_manage_your_time_as_a_solopreneur/h1bi6fe/) (in reply to ID nw5wzu):\nBasically, priorities and these priorities should be generally related to what will bring you more money and what will help you to grow more, basically set goals for short periods. Organize your day with few things but that is very productive and that gives a lot of results.

There are bells and whistles I still haven't tapped into and the customer service is great. I've only needed help with customer service once and it was resolved quickly.  The app is easy to manage, customize, and integrate with social media and my payment system. I absolutely love the appointment reminders my clients receive and how easy it is for them to reschedule. vCITA solves a huge administrative problem for me and keeps me sane as I juggle all of my roles and workload while providing excellent care to my clients.",

I know, because I have built a few businesses from the ground up and vCita has been my go to tool for a long time. \n\nIs it perfect, no, but from experience I can say that no tool is. What makes this product shine is the ease of use, for you the owner and for clients. It’s also extremely flexible with the ability to customize everything. With a little help from a seasoned pro, this tool can do anything from scheduling, reminders, payments and my favorite is the ability to integrate with Zapier - that’s when the real fun starts since you can share information between vCita and apps like QuickBooks, ship-station and so on. Ohh, the client portal is a sweet new bonus feature! \n\nvCita is well worth the expense, in my professional opinion. \n\nThank you. \n\nSteve Madar - CEO\n@ Get Better Clicks\nAds | Automation | Consultations",

      "# [Feature focus: Counting down vcita’s top features of 2024 by Tzach Malul, Product Marketing Manager on 2025-01-02](https://www.vcita.com/blog/business-management/vcitas-new-features-of-2024)\nvcita’s vision is clear: make the lives of you, the small business owners, easier and help you build a business you’re proud of. In order to do so, our platform must continue to evolve along with the needs of our users. And it has (just like it did last year)!\n\nThis past year, the vcita platform underwent so many changes, it’s hardly recognizable (especially the CRM and checkout process). So without further ado, here are the top 10 newest features and improvements we made to our business management platform over the past 12 months to ensure we meet the needs of all our SMBs!\n\nCaller ID\n\nHate picking up the phone with a “Hello, who’s this?” It sounds unprofessional and leaves you playing the guessing game before nervously answering the phone. Well not anymore!\n\nWith vcita’s Caller ID, your phone will recognize any customer or lead from your CRM and display their name so you know who’s calling you before you pick up the phone. This way, you can tailor your interactions with each caller to boost your customer experiences and offer exceptional service.\n\nSaving and charging cards on file\n\nSay goodbye to repetitive payment steps and hello to faster transactions with this feature. By being able to save and charge credit cards on file, we’ve simplified the payment process and enabled you to provide a better client experience.\n\nYou can save up to 3 cards per client, and, when it’s time to charge (whether it’s one time or recurring), simply choose the card you’d like to charge and voila! Quicker payments, happier clients, streamlined operations, and complete flexibility.\n\nBizAI\n\nPerhaps one of our bigger announcements of the year: BizAI, our AI tool/business advisor for SMBs rolled out and made huge waves. It’s an AI chat interface that you can ask pretty much anything – from the meaning of life to how much you should price your services. But the coolest part is that it’s embedded into your vcita account, meaning it already knows your business.\n\nThis means that you don’t need to feed it any information about your business, your services, your prices, etc. It collects data from internal and external sources to provide you with the best answer to your queries.\n\nFor example, say you wanted to know how much you should price a new service you plan to offer. BizAI would tell you how much others are pricing that same service in your area, and tell you, based on your current pricing and market, where you should price yourself. Pretty nifty huh?\n\nOffer refunds\n\nWe made the payment process even clearer with our partial refund feature. Now, you can offer a partial refund easily for both online and offline payments. Whether it’s because of a price discrepancy, someone canceled their appointment, or returned a product, you’ll have the refund recorded both in the payment and in the client card.\n\nAnd the best part is, you get to choose how much you want to refund. There isn’t a set interval or amount to choose from, simply enter in the amount you wish to refund, whether it’s a dollar amount or a percentage of the final charge, and done!\n\nBook multiple appointments at once\n\nLet’s say you’re a salon and your client wants a haircut, highlights and a blowdry all at once. With this new feature you can book all three appointments on behalf of your client at the same time and block out that time with ease.\n\nAssign different staff members to each slot, charge separately for each appointment, and refund partially in case they decide not to go with the blowdry – so dynamic!\n\nCalls & Texting app\n\nThis new app completely changes the way you interact with your clients. Allowing you to use a toll-free number, keeping your personal number private, to text or forward calls to your business or even specific team members. Each call gets recorded, so you can listen in and optimize your customer service, and when calls come in during off-hours, they’ll get redirected to an automatic voice message.\n\nMissed calls get logged in the vcita platform, so you never miss a beat, and calls from leads create new client cards so no lead falls through the cracks. You’ll also be able to record a custom greeting that’ll play when callers contact your business, making you sound super professional and keeping you well organized.\n\nWebsite Builder app\n\nNot all small businesses have a website, but all small businesses need one. That’s where this app comes in. It scrapes the information from the vcita platform and builds you a beautiful, fully customizable website in minutes! No need to hire a designer or wait for all the back and forth. You control the process and get a site that’s optimized for all devices.\n\nYou can also add our widgets for booking, paying, and contacting your business directly onto the site without any hassle. And because it works so well with the vcita platform, you can import leads into your CRM to ensure you never miss an opportunity.\n\nFacebook Messenger app\n\nThis app allows you to combine the power of vcita with the strength of social media. Whenever you get contacted on Facebook, the lead or the conversation will get updated in your CRM. That way, whenever you ask for someone’s email or phone number, it gets saved in your CRM so you never have to go back through chat history to look for it.\n\nThe best part? It all happens automatically and in real time enabling you to keep conversations engaging without any manual entry. And following up and tracking conversations is extremely simple because it’s all in your CRM!\n\nNew checkout experience\n\nWe’ve made the checkout process simple and sleek for you as a small business owner, similar to what you’d expect from Amazon or Etsy. All you have to do is click on the items from your catalog, edit the prices if you wish, and charge your client.\n\nGot a walk-in client? No worries! You can create a “Jon Doe” (or a “Jane Doe”) and charge them with all the products and services they consume during their visit. It’s as simple as “adding to cart” and checking out.\n\nThe new CRM\n\nLast but certainly not least on the list is our new CRM. Equipped with everything you need to run a successful and growing business, this CRM allows you to manage different views so you can keep a better eye on your business’ overall health.\n\nEach view presents your clients differently (for example: new inquiries, approved estimates, recently active, etc.) and can also be customized for you and your staff. You can also perform bulk actions helping you save a bunch of time on admin work (which is what we’re all about).\n\nBring it on, 2025…\n\nWe worked hard this year, all in the name of bettering small businesses everywhere. With our understanding of SMB needs, like a customizable CRM, social media integration, and an easier checkout process, we changed and adapted our solution to be even more comprehensive than it was before.\n\nAnd it only made us hungrier for what’s to come. We’ve put together a roadmap for 2025 that will have you floored, and we can’t wait to start rolling out the new features and enhancements.\n\nStay tuned for what’s to come next!",
      "# [Popular payment methods for small business owners by Bryan Simmons, Content on 2024-09-16](https://www.vcita.com/blog/payments/payment-methods-for-small-business)\nYou’re a small business owner looking to get paid quickly and without fuss. You want to make it as easy as possible for your customers to pay you, and keep payment fees to a minimum. But which payment methods should you offer, and how can you stop processing fees from mounting up?\n\nThe good news is that there are plenty of options. Accepting credit cards used to mean a clunky merchant account and heavy transaction fees, but not anymore. Mobile payments, online payment gateways, and popular third-party processors now offer small business owners like you affordable payment solutions to accept credit cards and manage cash flow.\n\nThis overview of payment options helps you make smart decisions about receiving payments and avoiding excessive transaction fees.\n\nAccepting credit and debit cards for your small business\n\nThe key benefits\n\nOffering credit and debit card payments is a must for small businesses today. Not only does it provide convenience for customers, but it can also boost your cash flow and increase sales. With mobile payment solutions and online payment gateways, accepting popular payment methods like credit cards has never been easier.\n\nGetting set up\n\nTo start accepting credit and debit cards, you’ll need a merchant account from a bank or payment processor. This allows you to receive electronic funds from customer’s bank accounts when they pay with cards. You’ll also need a payment gateway – software that securely transmits card data between you, the customer, and your merchant account provider. Many providers bundle the merchant account and payment gateway together as an all-in-one credit card processing solution.\n\nChoosing the right option\n\nThere are various ways to actually accept the card payments in person or online. For in-store purchases, you can use a simple card reader that connects to your mobile device or POS system. For ecommerce or invoicing, an online payment method integrated with your website or software is ideal. Popular options include Stripe, Square, PayPal, and services like vcita that bundle it all together. Just watch out for transaction fees that can eat into your profits.\n\nThe payoff\n\nWhile there are some upfront and ongoing costs, the ability to accept credit and debit card payments is worth it. Customers expect the convenience and flexibility of using their preferred type of payment method. Offering it can help you stand out, increase sales from impulse buys, and maintain a healthy cash flow.\n\nSetting up a merchant account and payment gateway\n\nOpen your merchant account\n\nTo accept credit and debit card payments, you’ll need a merchant account. Setting one up is pretty straightforward. You’ll apply to a merchant account provider, sharing details about your business. Once approved, you can start accepting popular payment types like Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover.\n\nChoose an online payment gateway\n\nAn online payment gateway is the virtual terminal that securely processes credit card payments for your business. It encrypts customer’s bank account info and connects with your merchant account to move funds. Many merchant account providers offer their own integrated payment gateways. Or you can opt for third-party solutions like PayPal, Stripe, or Square. They integrate seamlessly with e-commerce platforms and charge around 2.9% + $0.30 per online transaction. Just be sure any gateway you use is PCI compliant to protect customer data.\n\nConsider mobile payments\n\nLots of small business owners now accept mobile payments using smartphone card readers and apps. Solutions like Square, PayPal, and Clover allow you to securely accept chip or contactless payments like Apple Pay on the go.\n\nMind the fees\n\nOf course, all these online payment methods for small businesses come with transaction fees. Merchant account fees can range from a few cents plus a percentage for each sale. Same for mobile payment processors. Factori those credit card processing costs into your pricing to keep cash flow healthy.\n\nMobile and online payment options for small businesses\n\nConvenient payment solutions\n\nThese days, customers expect a seamless payment experience – whether shopping online or in person. As a small business owner, offering mobile and online payment options is crucial. It allows you to meet customer expectations and boost sales.\n\nAccept credit cards on-the-go\n\nA mobile credit card reader turns your smartphone or tablet into a virtual payment terminal. This pocket-sized device lets you accept credit and debit card payments anywhere – at events, markets, or customer locations. Just plug it into your device’s audio jack or connect via Bluetooth.\n\nPopular options like Square, PayPal Here, and Intuit GoPayment make it easy to start accepting plastic on your mobile. The fees are low, with rates around 2.7% per swiped transaction.\n\nStay flexible with virtual terminals\n\nVirtual terminals allow you to manually key in card details and accept payments over the phone, by mail, or in your office. Popular options include PayPal Virtual Terminal, Dharma, and Square Virtual Terminal. The fees are similar to online gateways.\n\nUnified payment solutions\n\nAll-in-one platforms like vcita consolidate mobile payments, online gateways, virtual terminals and more into one easy solution. This provides a centralized way to accept all major payment types – simplifying operations and cash flow tracking.\n\nPCI compliance: what small business owners need to know\n\nPCI compliance is crucial when accepting credit and debit card payments. It helps protect your customers’ sensitive data and builds trust. Failing to comply can lead to hefty fines, lawsuits, and damage to your reputation.\n\nWhat is PCI compliance?\n\nPCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) is a set of security standards for businesses that handle, store or transmit credit card data. It ensures that you have robust measures in place to safeguard cardholder information from theft or misuse.\n\nWhy it matters\n\nData breaches and fraud are on the rise. Customers want assurance their card details are safe with you. Being PCI compliant shows you take security seriously and value their privacy. It can give you an edge over competitors.\n\nKey requirements\n\nThe key compliance areas for PCI include:\n\nUsing PCI-approved payment gateways and card readers\n\nEncrypting transmission of cardholder data\n\nRestricting data access to employees who need it\n\nMaintaining secure systems and applications\n\nRegularly monitoring and testing networks\n\nEnsuring PCI compliance\n\nFor small merchants, PCI compliance starts with your payment processor or gateway provider. They’ll have a program and self-assessment questionnaires tailored to your needs. Work closely with them to implement best practices specific to your business.\n\nThe path to full PCI DSS compliance has some upfront costs. But it’s an investment that pays dividends through increased customer trust and avoiding costly data breaches down the road.\n\nChoosing the right payment processing solutions for your small business needs\n\nOffering the most popular payment methods\n\nAs a small business owner, offering convenient payment options is crucial for keeping your customers happy and your cash flow healthy. You want to make sure to offer the payment methods that your customers prefer.\n\nAccepting credit and debit cards is a must these days, as most customers prefer the convenience of plastic over cash. You’ll need a merchant account and payment gateway to process these transactions. Mobile payments like Apple Pay and Google Pay are also becoming increasingly popular, especially among younger customers.\n\nFinding the right fit\n\nNow that you know the options, it’s time to figure out which ones make sense for your business. Consider factors like the type of goods or services you offer, your average transaction amount, and how often you get paid.\n\nFor example, if you’re a mobile service provider like a plumber or landscaper, a card reader that accepts contactless payments on-the-go could be a game-changer. But if you run an online store, an e-commerce platform with a built-in payment gateway might be a better choice.\n\nKeeping it secure and affordable\n\nOf course, security and affordability are also key concerns. Look for PCI-compliant solutions that protect your customers’ data and don’t nickel-and-dime you with hidden fees. Many providers charge a flat monthly rate plus reasonable transaction fees, which can help you budget better.\n\nTools like vcita’s all-in-one business management software can streamline your payment process while meeting security standards. With options for online payments, invoicing, and accepting credit cards, it’s a versatile solution worth considering.\n\nThe right payment methods can boost sales",

      "# [Retirement Plan Administration – NSHE System Administration](https://nshe.nevada.edu/system-administration/departments/finance/retirement/)\nUpdated 3/3/2025\n\nPresident Biden recently signed the Social Security Fairness Act (HR 82) into law, repealing the Government Pension Offset (GPO) and Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP). This change may increase Social Security benefits for some retirees, but final determinations will be made by the Social Security Administration (SSA). Affected recipients will be notified directly by the SSA about any updates to their benefits.\n\nThe changes apply to benefits payable after December 2023. Starting the week of February 24, 2025, the SSA will begin issuing retroactive payments and increased monthly benefits to eligible individuals.\n\nRetroactive Payments: Eligible beneficiaries will receive a one-time payment by the end of March 2025, covering benefit increases back to January 2024.\n\nMonthly Benefit Adjustments: New benefit amounts will begin with the April 2025 payment (for March benefits).\n\nMailed Notices: Beneficiaries will receive one or two notices from SSA explaining their updated benefits. Some may receive the retroactive payment before the notice arrives.\n\nProcessing Time: Automated processing has expedited payments, but complex cases will require additional time for manual review.\n\nInquiries: Beneficiaries are encouraged to wait until April before contacting SSA about their payments, as processing will occur throughout March.\n\nThe SSA is working diligently to implement these changes, but the process may take time due to necessary adjustments. For the most up-to-date information, visit the link and subscribe to the FAQ on the Social Security Fairness Act page.\n\nhttps://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/social-security-fairness-act.html\n\nAt NSHE, we prioritize the security of your financial information. As part of our commitment to keeping your data safe, we partner with TIAA, a trusted financial institution that employs industry-leading security measures to protect your online accounts.\n\nTIAA uses multifactor authentication (MFA) to ensure that only you can access your account.

In addition, TIAA offers optional security features you can enable for enhanced protection:\n\n🔹 Biometric authentication – Use your fingerprint or facial recognition on the TIAA app for secure, convenient logins.\n\n🔹 One-time passcode (OTP) – Receive a unique passcode sent to your mobile device every time you log in, adding an extra layer of security.\n\nTIAA’s Security Operations Center provides 24/7 monitoring to protect your account, using advanced detection technologies and threat intelligence to stay ahead of potential threats.

      "# [Mastercard launches Biz360 digital toolset for small businesses by Paul Demery, Mark Brohan on 2024-11-13](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2024/11/13/mastercard-launches-biz360-digital-toolset-for-small-businesses/)\nMastercard Inc., in a new Mastercard Signals report released this week, notes the worldwide significance of small and midsize businesses.\n\n“SMEs are the lifeblood of the global economy — they account for 90% of enterprises and half of the workforce,” the report says.\n\n“We’re committed to empowering small businesses for the digital future.\n\nJane Prokop, executive vice president, global head of small and medium enterprises\n\nMastercard Inc.\n\nBut despite their vital presence, the Signals report notes that SMEs too often operate in need of the latest and most useful digital financial management tools, ranging from managing orders and invoicing to guarding against cyber attacks and accessing financing. The report adds that financial services or fintech firms often find it difficult to serve the diversified SME market’s wide-ranging needs.\n\nMastercard announced this week that it is out to overhaul small and midsize businesses’ access to the business management tools they need. Noting that it recently met its goal of bringing 50 million micro, small and midsized businesses into the digital economy through online payment acceptance, Mastercard says it’s offering its new Biz360 application suite as a “comprehensive digital solution” designed to let fintech providers equip their small and midsized business customers “with a simplified way to manage the most critical aspects of running and growing a business.”\n\n“We’re committed to empowering small businesses for the digital future by providing the innovative technologies they need to succeed,” says Jane Prokop, executive vice president and global head of small and medium enterprises.\n\nMastercard says SMEs find friction in using digital tools\n\nIn a study report it released last year, Mastercard noted that 75% of small businesses use digital tools in their daily operations, and that two-thirds of them listed “a seamless, digital experience as critical to their business.”\n\nBut it added, “The experience is far from frictionless with 25% of small business owners burdened by using more than six different platforms.”\n\nIn a separate Foundry report released in June, Mastercard noted that “small businesses revealed that they are using up to four different tools to manage their invoicing alone.”\n\nMastercard’s Biz360 digital features\n\nBiz360’s and capabilities include:\n\n⦁ A client portal where small business owners can “manage and cultivate customer relationships, boost loyalty through personalized email and marketing campaigns, and enhance their digital presence with website creation capabilities.\n\n⦁ Personalized business performance reports, “allowing business owners to unlock valuable insights that help guide more informed decision making.\n\n⦁ Automating administrative tasks and integrating business management tools into a single platform, allowing entrepreneurs to “focus on strategic, revenue-generating activities.”\n\n⦁ The ability to consolidate digital operational tools, subscriptions and payment gateways into single digital experience instead of relying on siloed technologies.\n\nProkop says Biz360 “is designed to support small businesses at every stage of growth, allowing a small business owner to select the subscription tier best fit for their needs. The platform subscription cost is determined by the distribution partner.”\n\nMastercard adds that deploying and integrating the Biz360 suite “requires minimal effort from both [fintech] providers and their small business customers.”\n\nMastercard rolls out Biz360 with Hello Alice\n\nTo initially roll out Biz360, Mastercard will collaborate with Hello Alice, a small business fintech platform. Hello Alice describes its operation as an online platform that guides business owners “through every step of their entrepreneurial journey by providing knowledge, funding, networks and peer-to-peer connections with more than 1 million small business owners.” Its website includes links to business services, including an application for a Hello Alice Small Business Mastercard.\n\n“We’re committed to empowering Main Street by equipping American small business owners with the tools they need to succeed in today’s fast-paced, digitally-driven economy,” says Elizabeth Gore, co-founder and president at Hello Alice.\n\nMastercard is also collaborating with vcita, a digital technology platform designed for organizations that serve the small businesses in such areas as customer engagement, payment collection and time management.\n\n“Our collaboration with Mastercard facilitates the digitization of operations, helping small businesses maximize growth and customer satisfaction,” says Itzik Levy, vcita’s founder and CEO.\n\nGoing forward, Mastercard says it “aims to broaden Biz360’s reach across additional markets in 2025 and expand the platform’s capabilities to address the evolving needs of small business owners.”\n\nPaul Demery is a Digital Commerce 360 contributing editor covering B2B digital commerce technology and strategy.

      "# [Ups and Feedback Are Key in Client Management by NewsWatch on 2025-03-13](https://newswatchtv.com/2025/03/13/why-follow-ups-and-feedback-are-key-in-client-management/?amp=1)\nClient management requires building enduring connections since it serves as more than just the process of making sales contracts. The plan to achieve long-term client relationships requires something beyond initial one-on-one meetings. Business success depends on follow-ups and feedback processes to maintain client satisfaction.\n\nBuilding Better Relationships with Follow-Ups\n\nFollow-ups are essential. Apart from confirming transactions and sharing information, clients can depend on follow-ups to show genuine care. A brief message, whether through phone or email, transforms ordinary service encounters into meaningful moments for clients. But timing matters. The connection could become weak if you delay making contact.\n\nWaiting too early for the follow-up can create a perception of pushiness towards the target client. This is where tools like vcita shine. With vcita, you can easily manage client relationships and schedule appointments without headaches. The system simplifies your whole interaction process while keeping you focused. Your clients will feel valued because you stay on top of important follow-ups through this system.\n\nThe Value of Feedback\n\nFollowing up stands as an outstanding method to demonstrate value for your audience because people desire acknowledgment. Your client will feel genuine concern because of your careful follow-up even after the first transaction, which creates a strong permanent impact. Such a minor interaction serves as the foundation for developing trust and loyalty between people who wish to establish long-term relationships.\n\nThe expense of keeping current clients proves higher than acquiring fresh clients because retention costs are almost 600 percent less than client acquisition costs. Your committed customers will purchase again, and they also act as brand promoters.\n\nWhen you want to achieve effective follow-ups, you should maintain personal interactions. Generic communication methods allow clients to easily recognize them and produce feelings of being unimportant.\n\nUse past dialogues and particular projects, along with genuine business knowledge, to show genuine interest. Software like vcita can help streamline and personalize these follow-ups, ensuring no client feels overlooked.\n\nYour genuine interest in clients as individuals expresses itself through these efforts because you care to notice them beyond being mere business contacts. Personalized interactions enhance client relationships while also building clients’ feeling of importance throughout their relationship.\n\nFollow-Ups and Retention\n\nFollowing up provides the perfect platform for showing appreciation towards people. A well-planned follow-up demonstrates your ongoing client concern, which leaves strong positive impacts on people’s minds. A basic follow-up action establishes trust and develops loyalty between both parties, thus driving long-term connections.\n\nThe value of maintaining existing customers exceeds the costs of continually seeking new clients because it takes six times more resources and expenses to acquire fresh clients than it does to keep current ones. Repeated business from loyal clients enters your realm while these customers frequently become brand advocates.\n\nEffective follow-ups occur when you maintain a personalized approach toward your clients. Generic messages quickly reveal themselves to clients, who may then feel unimportant. You should refer to particular past exchanges or show familiarity with their business activities or project work.\n\nHow Technology Helps\n\nWorking with numerous clients becomes a challenging task. That is why technology serves as a critical transformation for business operations. The work behind business management for small businesses operates through automated processes.\n\nTools like vcita help you maintain organizational structure while avoiding the chance of missing any crucial details. All tracking data and future scheduling exist within a single platform.\n\nOne of the top features in small business management software is automation. The system enables users to establish follow-up alerts and design organized workflows that keep your client interaction sequence on track.\n\nAll your business operations benefit from these tools, which help you maintain your organization while remaining focused on important priorities. Such consolidation empowers you to focus exclusively on relationship building and exceptional results since all your processes exist in one place.\n\nWhy Consistency Is Key\n\nConsistency builds trust. Clients begin to doubt your delivery capabilities whenever you fail to keep appointments, delay information delivery, or miss deadlines. Trust forms from dependable actions, yet slight inconsistencies may trigger doubts in customers.\n\nDeliver updates on schedule and meet deadlines to show your professionalism to the client. Your reliability increases because of consistent communication, which also helps establish your professional reputation. vcita for example, can assist in managing appointments and reminders, ensuring you stay on track and maintain trust.\n\nThe reliable attitude among clients transforms into increased loyalty, which results in repeat business and active client recommendations. Clients will fondly remember and promote positive experiences when they work with a dependable service provider. Clear reminders function as protective measures against forgotten tasks, particularly when business reaches high peaks.\n\nWrapping It Up\n\nFollow-ups and feedback aren’t just tasks on your to-do list—they’re powerful tools for building lasting business relationships. A thoughtful follow-up shows clients that you’re attentive, reliable, and genuinely interested in maintaining the connection beyond the initial interaction.\n\nSimilarly, providing meaningful feedback or requesting it demonstrates that you value their perspective and are actively invested in their success. These small but impactful actions not only help address concerns or questions promptly but also leave a lasting impression of professionalism and care. When done consistently and effectively, follow-ups and feedback can turn one-time clients into loyal advocates who trust and recommend your brand."
