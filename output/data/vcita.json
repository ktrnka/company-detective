      "# [Download and manage your leads! on 2023-10-31](https://www.vcita.com/templates/crm)\nUse your CRM template to map your client’s sales journey\n\nThink about your customers’ journey from discovering your business to booking with you, and what steps you take to communicate with them. Your sales funnel is a good place to start. Picture all your potential customers at the top of the funnel, and what steps they take as they move down the four stages: awareness, interest, decision, and action.\n\n1. Awareness stage\n\nAt the top of your sales funnel are customers that know about you, usually called the “awareness” stage—maybe they’ve just done a Google search and found your website, or discovered you on social media. These are usually cold leads.\n\nHow your customers find you are your lead sources. For example, you might get customers through referrals, Facebook, lead pages, directories, or paid ads.\n\nIf you use a CRM template to track lead sources, over time you’ll be able to figure out what ones are getting you clients and what ones aren’t.Interest stage: a smaller subset of your customers might start reading your blog, looking through your website, or comparing you to some of your competitors—the “interest” stage. These are warm leads; they’ve shown interest in your service, but haven’t committed yet.\n\nThis is the stage when you might collect some of their info—for example, if someone signs up for your email list or downloads an ebook on your website. Take note of any specialized info you gather, so you can add it to your sales lead template.\n\nThink about how you nurture leads in this stage of the process. When do you reach out to them? How often?\n\n2. Decision stage\n\nA client might book a consultation or appointment in the “decision” stage. These are hot leads; they’ve made an active decision towards making a purchase.\n\nKeep in mind that your lead isn’t a customer until you get paid. It’s all too common for people to book an appointment and cancel before they go, so it’s still important to nurture leads in this stage.\n\nAfter the decision stage, give some thought to actions like follow up emails and appointment reminders that will give your clients that extra push to commit. Don’t let forgetfulness be the reason why you lose clients!\n\n3. Action stage",

Customer service (live) isn’t all that easy to reach either. The client  ecard is great and the ability to create tags and categories is nice. The rest just needs work.

A booking requires payment before the booking goes through, and I only accept payments through PayPal.\n\nA client booked a consultation and then immediately sent me a message saying they wanted to cancel.  I refunded their payment.\n\nThey have since kept contacting me saying they didn't receive the refund.  I sent them a screenshot from PayPal showing the refund.  The person contacting me is identifying themselves as an \"Administrator\" and is someone different than the person who booked the call.\n\nThey said they paid through Venmo--I'm not even sure if that's possible with Vcita and/or PayPal, but whatever, on my end it's a PayPal payment and I refunded it, so I'm done.\n\nThere is absolutely zero chance that I send them money any other way, so their scam won't succeed.\n\nBut it seems like about the stupidest scam ever.  They actually sent me money through PayPal--I don't think there's a way for them to book without sending me money.  So the scam would have the risk that some people don't refund their original payment.\n\nThis is my first one of these in about 6 years of booking consultations this way.\n\nThoughts?\n\n## Comment ID ijmxllo with +19 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-08-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/taxpros/comments/wkbna1/weird_potential_scam/ijmxllo/) (in reply to ID wkbna1):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID ijmzwqr with +7 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-08-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/taxpros/comments/wkbna1/weird_potential_scam/ijmzwqr/) (in reply to ID ijmxllo):\n>They probably paid with stolen PayPal credentials or with a stolen credit card via PayPal.\n\nAh, makes sense, that explains it.\n\n## Comment ID ijohjuh with +2 score by [(attosec, Reddit, 2022-08-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/taxpros/comments/wkbna1/weird_potential_scam/ijohjuh/) (in reply to ID wkbna1):\nYou wrote “I refunded their payment”.

All efforts to learn to do it better are worth the time and energy! \n\nI personally do a lot of just article-reading on Time Management Strategies via Google and read whatever catches my eye based on what I’m feeling like I need. \n\nGoogle The Pomodoro technique - it is fantastic and has been a great foundational system for people with huge blocks of time or are in charge of their own schedules to stay productive but not overdo it. \n\nTracking your time and using a timer are essential  because often we don’t even realize exactly how that time is being used. It’s a great exercise that can be pretty enlightening. \n\nDon’t be surprised if what works one day starts to not work anymore. Things change and I’ve noticed that staying committed to the art of time management itself (versus, say, committing to a specific technique and never varying) is the key. Stay flexible, stay agile and don’t be afraid to drop a technique if it ISN’T working. Try something else instead. \n\nGood luck! \n\nIt’s a juggling act, but at a certain point it’s also like riding a bike, you start to get the hang of the balance of motion and can maneuver it around just like you would a bicycle.\n\n## Comment ID h0plyh2 with +2 score by [(BearRootCrusher, Reddit, 2021-06-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/nsiu7a/do_any_freelancerssoloentrepreneurs_have_time/h0plyh2/) (in reply to ID nsiu7a):\nThere is a simple system called COD(collect, organize, do) a modified version of Getting Things Done that is amazing.

By using the booking links in our app, you can share your links to your clients and customers on which time you could accommodate them (so that you can have time for deep work and personal time) but on another note,  you can create your private workspace with the team you are working with where you can see easily the common free time you have.\n\n  \nWe designed Teemly in this way because we want to help people with time management issues like you to be able to own their time but as well as respect other people's time. I believe building this culture is definitely a need in this fast changing world.   \n\n\nHope you can check us out and maybe sign up now at [www.teemly.io/signup](https://www.teemly.io/signup).",

Had a client leave them recently and Thryv refused to release the number they had registered for the client to use with the software. So the phone number they had been texting from and receiving calls through for two years was lost unless they wanted to stay with this company. They claim that we were told not to use the number in our ads but 1) you don't need it in your ads if you're texting everyone from it and 2) they plastered that number all over the website they built for us.

So to make the rate you're hoping to, you have to set your rate very high.  \n\nWyzAnt also says that they have an online platform for meetings, with a whiteboard and shared text editor.  But the whiteboard is buggy as hell and none of its solutions is better than the alternatives for online meetings.  I use Vibe and screen sharing through Zoom or whatever, even when I connect with students on WyzAnt.  \n\nThe thing that WyzAnt offers is a secured rating system, a payment system, and advertising.  WyzAnt comes up first in most searches for online tutoring, so you're going to get your \"cold contacts\" (i.e. people not referred to you through other connections) that way.  Also you can be sure you won't get someone who refuses to pay for the meeting because you can bill them.  Also, and this really important, nobody can rate you who hasn't met with you.  In any other system where someone can rate you without hiring you, there will always be some tutor who is competing with you and will negatively rate you so that they relatively advance in the rating system.  \n\nSo WyzAnt kinda sucks but you're missing out if you don't list yourself there.  It's the way of the world right now.  \n\nThe bonus is that it's free to put a profile on there, and the background check is cheap, so why not just do it?\n\nI would say likewise, just throw a profile on every other free site.  Why not?  But as far as I know there is no \"good\" online tutoring platform.  If they put any money into being highly placed in Google search returns, they don't pay you hardly anything.\n\n### Comment ID ikr3hxr with +6 score by [(AppointmentFun7525, Reddit, 2022-08-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/tutor/comments/tjebc1/is_wyzant_a_good_platform_for_tutors_what_are/ikr3hxr/) (in reply to ID i1jlfgr):\n25% cut is nothing, especially with the nationwide marketing and access to clientele you get through WyzAnt. I’m curious to know which companies let you keep 80% or more? \nMost local tutoring companies take half or more. I get $40-50/ hour for $80-$100 sessions with small local companies.  Princeton Review paid me $23/hour for private tutoring while pocketing $114. You can absolutely keep more percentage by going out on your own, but you need to have enough traffic on your site to make it worth it.\nPersonally, I’m happy to pay the 25% for marketing, scheduling, posting testimonials and ratings, allowing me to charge for last minute cancellations, and saving me the time to “convince” each and every new client that I’m worth the money. \nWyzAnt also keeps excellent track of lessons and finances which is a huge help for taxes and loan applications. It’s like paying an office assistant to do all that for me, and I’m okay with that. \nAgain, I would like to know which companies are letting you keep more than $80 because I will gladly switch if the services are comparable!\n\n#### Comment ID iky1l5z with +1 score by [(axiom_tutor, Reddit, 2022-08-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/tutor/comments/tjebc1/is_wyzant_a_good_platform_for_tutors_what_are/iky1l5z/) (in reply to ID ikr3hxr):\n25% is definitely something.  Sure, there is a justification for taking a percentage, and getting top placement in search results isn't easy.  But 25% is pretty borderline insane, and I would not at all characterize my attitude toward it as happy.  10-15% would make me happy--I'd believe that that much is necessary for SEO, a webdev team, and management overhead.  But there is definitely some point at which I believe this is just them getting away with an outsized rate because they know they can get away with it, and 25% is in the neighborhood for me.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, I still do it, and just post an insanely inflated rate that relatively few people are willing to pay so that I get a reasonable rate.  And I sometimes get work that way.  But I also certainly look for ways around the trap too.\n\n### Comment ID i1jpmt7 with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-03-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/tutor/comments/tjebc1/is_wyzant_a_good_platform_for_tutors_what_are/i1jpmt7/) (in reply to ID i1jlfgr):\nThanks!

You have a nice website, a good GMB presence, good customer service, and make it as easy as possible for customers to give you their information and contact you.\n\n>Essentially that's all there is to it. You make a \"funnel\" where it's fast and easy for customers to give you their information, and then you drive traffic to the funnel. Whether or not that's through Facebook ads, SEO, or flyers, the premise is the same.\n\n>I follow the /r/marketing subreddit to stay up to date with industry changes, and I'm a regular at various conferences, they're webinars in this covid world. VCita is running one on Tuesday (free) on the topic of generating leads which I'll be attending: \nhttp://landing.vcita.com/100waystogetleads\n\n>I'd also follow the general ethos of this subreddit, which is to make customer service your priority.

And those types of leads are a lot easier to close because you’ve been referred. But a business should not rely on just word of mouth only. The most valuable business that build value and make it easy to sell have a proven lead generating strategy. A business that has a website and other digital assets that has a consistent flow of leads through multiple lead streams will sell for a lot more money than one that just relies on word of mouth. We also help businesses build value and prepare owners that might one day pass on the business to children, their employees or sell out to retire. \nOwners that pass their business to children or employees often find themselves financing part of the business by taking a portion of the business’s profits every year. If you do that you definitely want to make sure that business has a well thought out lead generation strategy.\nBest wishes!\n\n## Comment ID ga5xl6f with +5 score by [(onions-make-me-cry, Reddit, 2020-10-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/jicl2v/how_does_a_local_service_business_generate_leads/ga5xl6f/) (in reply to ID jicl2v):\nHey OP...

Have a Facebook page for your business.\n4. Get active in local Facebook groups. Make a generic poster for the kind of services you provide along with contact information. Post it bi-weekly in all the local Facebook groups.\n5. If you have a budget, Get a website and do local SEO. I would strongly advise, using voice searches term.

But mostly I use my content feed to tease projects and create content for my clients to use to build their respective client bases, benefitting me in the long run. \n\nFor example, I posted some detail shots of a project I’m about to complete, tagged the materials vendor and my client. My client was able to share the pics with her client as a fun status update, and I received 2 inquiries off her feed from other designers I’ve been wanting to work with for years. On another pic of a recently completed project, I had 3-4 of my client’s clients engage with the post, which in turn gave my clients the opportunity to sell this particular type of project to the end user that they otherwise wouldn’t have had. Other posts are used to educate the consumer base: time lapse videos of construction, demos of the equipment we use to make our products, etc. Consumers are very uneducated about custom manufacturing, so putting a human face and demonstrating the time and labor it takes to make our products goes a long way to minimize the sticker shock of our quotes. \n\nI know I’m approaching social media in a very strange way, but I gotta say it’s working for me.\n\n### Comment ID kgz6987 with +1 score by [(Local-Growth-Experts, Reddit, 2024-01-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/jicl2v/how_does_a_local_service_business_generate_leads/kgz6987/) (in reply to ID ga63exn):\nWhat type of business?

Looking into their backgrounds and client lists (publicly available via their shitty websites that hadn't been updated in 10 years), they were average salesmen at best during their careers and now strongarm businesses in dying industries run by fucking idiots into buying their \"5/7/9/15 step programme to sales success\" \n\nI was a member for about 6 months but refused to turn up again after one local business owner kept getting shit for not referring enough businesses, despite using another BNI member to build a £600k oak framed building.  Yes, it was one referral, but it eclipsed the other referral values combined for the rest of the year.  Apparently, that didn't matter.\n\nI actually lost a client over it (he was one of the grandmasters or whatever they call themselves), but the time I gained by not coming up with bullshit referrals and pushing people I shouldn't into rubbish meetings more than made up for the loss.  I now spend the same amount of money taking people to breakfast/lunch that I meet at better (cheaper) networking events for a more successful outcome.\n\n## Comment ID ga64ge4 with +2 score by [(swebe3qn, Reddit, 2020-10-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/jicl2v/how_does_a_local_service_business_generate_leads/ga64ge4/) (in reply to ID jicl2v):\nI‘ve created a lot of leads for a roofing company through Adwords.

What words do they use to describe that problem? What questions are they asking about that problem? \n\nWhere are they looking for info on solving that problem? \n\nGenerically, you'll need to have a web presence so people searching for your kind of services can find you. Google my business is free and easy. Facebook is too. Websites cost a couple hundred bucks these days. Yelp is fucking bullshit. \n\nPaid search works if you know how to work it. There's a lot of PPC snake oil salesmen out there but also good ones and there's a bunch of articles on how to tell the difference. I'd have an expert do it rather than try it and not perform well. \n\nMany service companies will partner with lead generation companies: they're great at getting phone calls that they can pass to you but aren't electricians or whatever. It's nice to use them because it's one less thing you need to worry about but they do take a piece of the pie and you don't have as much control over how you're presented or what calls you get, and have no opportunity to build a brand. \n\nThere's other methods that work. If you work on their property and do work that is visible, see if you can put up $10 yards signs so their neighbors can call you. Someone gave out $500 in lotto scratchers and got $14,000 in work from it. I gave out $50 gift cards to people that referred clients and got 2-3 more usually. \n\nMost importantly though: whenever you get a new customer ask them 1) how did you hear about us 2) what made you choose us. Your strongest marketing channels and value proposition are going to be things that you discover, not that you create.\n\n## Comment ID l9yh6of with +1 score by [(CreatorCrux, Reddit, 2024-06-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/jicl2v/how_does_a_local_service_business_generate_leads/l9yh6of/) (in reply to ID jicl2v):\nGenerating leads for a local service business in the digital space can greatly complement word-of-mouth referrals. Consider optimizing your presence on Google My Business for local searches and enhancing your website with local SEO tactics. Engaging with your community on social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram can also attract potential customers through updates and testimonials. Additionally, tools like ScrapR, a free Chrome extension, can efficiently scrape contact information such as phone numbers and emails from websites. This can help you reach out to leads directly and expand your customer base effectively.\n\n[Try it here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/scrapr/dcbomfjpkkfmabfdbedbccfnpmfpkhgc?authuser=0&hl=en&pli=1)\n\n## Comment ID lc6bqy7 with +1 score by [(deadheads_1, Reddit, 2024-07-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/jicl2v/how_does_a_local_service_business_generate_leads/lc6bqy7/) (in reply to ID jicl2v):\nGenerating leads for a local service business can definitely be expanded into the digital space, and it can be highly effective. \n\nHere are some strategies that have worked for my web design and SEO agency, and they can be applied to any local service business:\n\n# 1. Google My Business (GMB)\n\n* **Set Up and Optimize**: Make sure your GMB profile is fully set up with all your business details, operating hours, and high-quality photos.\n* **Regular Updates**: Post updates, photos, and special offers regularly to keep your profile active.\n* **Encourage Reviews**: Ask satisfied customers to leave positive reviews, which can significantly boost your visibility and credibility.\n\n# 2. Local SEO\n\n* **Optimize Your Website**: Make sure your website is optimized for local searches. Include local keywords and create content around them.\n* **Create Location-Specific Pages**: If you serve multiple areas, create dedicated pages for each location with relevant keywords.\n* **Backlinks**: Get listed on local directories and engage in local community activities to earn backlinks.\n\n# 3. Social Media\n\n* **Engage with the Community**: Join local groups on Facebook, Nextdoor, and other platforms to engage with potential customers.\n* **Share Valuable Content**: Post regularly about your services, share tips related to your industry, and showcase customer testimonials.\n* **Run Local Ads**: Facebook and Instagram ads targeted to your local area can be very effective.\n\n# 4. Content Marketing\n\n* **Blog Posts**: Write blog posts that address common questions and issues related to your services. This can help attract organic traffic.\n* **Videos**: Create videos showcasing your work, customer testimonials, and behind-the-scenes looks at your business.\n\n# 5. Lead Scraping with Google Maps\n\n* **Find Leads**: Use Google Maps to search for businesses \"Near Me\" and collect their details.\n* **Gather Information**: Note down contact numbers, email addresses, and website links.\n* **Analyze and Target**: Identify high-value targets and assess their online presence to see where you can offer value.\n\nIf you'd like to watch a detailed YouTube video on how I scrape leads using Google Maps and other strategies, DM me and I'll send you the link.\n\n## Comment ID lk4zror with +1 score by [(TotalPeachCase, Reddit, 2024-08-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/jicl2v/how_does_a_local_service_business_generate_leads/lk4zror/) (in reply to ID jicl2v):\nwww.market-monster.com helps roofers and contractors… well any service based business.

I advise once you work on your online presence, you have someone monitor and respond to reviews, comments, and interact with your customers.  The idea is, a lot is online now and customers love giving reviews. Potential customers look for reviews too before reaching out. The more you respond, the more they get a feel for your company.

Hand out your business cards for them to pass out that include a discount or free add-on service (value) to anyone who uses the code you print on the back of the card (exclusivity).\n\nSet up your business on every social media platform you can (FB, LI, IG, TWT, ND) so people can tag you when their friends ask for a referral.\n\nSend mail (letters or postcards) to homes listed on the MLS.

Like, I need the tile behind by bathroom tub redone because I was scammed by a Craigslist tile guy who got called to another job and got his 'friend' who never did tile before to totally fuck my shit up. I was out of town, and now I have to pay double to get it redone. \n\nSo, how does one overcome the fear people have hiring the 'right person' for the job? \n\nThe thing I want to see is photos of completed jobs that look almost exactly like mine. I want to see even tile, straight lines, nice cut tile that is symmetrical and not chipped, crooked, or janky. Photos that are high quality, but here is the thing. They can't be stock-photo quality, but can't be piss poor flash in the image quality. Also, having a person holding a sign, or a sign in the shot that isn't photoshopped in with the company name on it, means it is most likely real photos. So that shows they are experienced.\n\nThe next thing is, if I am about to spend $1k-$5k, what kind of testimonials are there? Are they fake or real? A real one would have both a negative and a positive, with the negative being not so bad. Fake ones are like those crazy over the top with words like 'perfect' 'amazing' 'wonderful' and stuff that is clearly orgasmic with the verbiage. It sounds like an Amazon review for a Chinese product because it can do everything like cure cancer from having tile put in. Yea, skip that guy. Look for real reviews.\n\nWhat other fears are out there? What does the owner look like? Is there a photo of him? Does he look like Mr. Burns from the Simpsons, or does he look like George Clooney? I feel more trustful from George than Mr. Burns with that shady eye evil grin. I also want to speak to the owner and get at least a verbal guarantee that the job will be done right and not half assed. \n\nLastly, and this is a big one: respect of my home, and clean up. Will they wear booties? Will they be gentile in my open areas with tools and not scuff my hall walls coming down it with a bucket of grout? Will they wear booties, and not stink like booze? Are their hoodies clean or are they pit-stained like they came from a homeless shelter? \n\nI think when you market ANY service, you have to overcome the fears that people have and their objections and also sound at least, reasonable. Most of us don't mind paying a 'fair price' for a 'good job' but when you have the 'new guy' doing your job wrong, the owner has two choices: fix it, or lie and scam. So making sure your advertising is reflective of overcoming 'no' and the fears, means your campaign is going to hit better when it lands in my inbox or in a flyer.\n\n## Comment ID ga9a1nu with +1 score by [(mrmetis, Reddit, 2020-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/jicl2v/how_does_a_local_service_business_generate_leads/ga9a1nu/) (in reply to ID jicl2v):\nit has variations but we can say inbound and outbound. I suggest inbound where customers look for you. so you create local address included content related to your products, where people can continue asking or researching your service. in there they will be giving out their information from your landing page. \n\n\n\nafter they become leads you can categorize them waiting, contacted once, rejected, agreed etc. cold calls email but critical virtue is ''follow up''. if you pay for ads it can help but it should be designed different.\n\n\n\nI would also suggest creating a blog for long term exposure and creating an ''authority image'' in the industry but since I dont know what you exactly do, I dont know if this is a good option for you.\n\n\ngood luck.\n\n## Comment ID ga9ynsg with +1 score by [(Unemployed20, Reddit, 2020-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/jicl2v/how_does_a_local_service_business_generate_leads/ga9ynsg/) (in reply to ID jicl2v):\nHey man,\n\nWill avoid any woo-woo MLM psychology shit here (ABC, etc.) and will go straight to the nitty gritty of low-cost/highly effective lead gen.\n\nA bit about myself, I run a B2B Lead Gen team and several growth hacking communities across Whatsapp & Facebook.\n\nSo we will start of with email:\n\nIf you're servicing other businesses (hence B2B), you can simply scrape facebook's business page directory ([www.facebook.com/pages/category](http://www.facebook(.)com/pages/category)) for the exact business category you're scraping and go further down by location.\n\nI show how to do this right here: [https://youtu.be/KxF7yWDoqvM](https://youtu.be/KxF7yWDoqvM)\n\nLinkedin:\n\nLinkedin can also serve as an awesome B2B lead generation channel, especially locally, considering that you're able to run a search based on exact location & industry. This works best for white-collar businesses but can also yield results for the lesser complex service lines.\n\nFacebook:\n\nFor the B2C aspect of things, hence, finding houses to paint, cars to fix, etc. I'd strongly recommend Facebook or Instagram Ads. Test with small budgets and then double down budget wise on the ad sets that work best. Make sure to use Facebook's Ad Library to actually spy on your competition and get a good idea on which ads are performing well and which ads are not. Use Facebook to reach an older demographic, and use Instagram to reach your location's younger demographic.\n\nAdditionally note that from a B2B perspective, you can also scrape local small business owner groups within your region, save the profile URLs and then use a tool like Texau to outreach to 30 of them automatically per day. (More grey hat but super do-able)\n\nContent:\n\nSEO is super competitive, especially with keywords like \"Plumber near me\" or \"Mechanic near me\", but Youtube's SEO is much much more easier to dominate. This is exactly why I always recommend that \"long-sighted\" businesses actually take the time to create service-related content as it can drastically improve your deal flow in the long run. Much less of an upfront $$$ investment, but more of a time investment with crazy results.\n\nHope this helped.\n\nThose are my ideas from the top of my head, without looking at your site/url.\n\nIf you have more questions, DM.\n\n## Comment ID k8z6vjv with +1 score by [(Proof_Title116, Reddit, 2023-11-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/jicl2v/how_does_a_local_service_business_generate_leads/k8z6vjv/) (in reply to ID jicl2v):\nVery old thread, but I wanted to chime in on the topic. \n\nYou would not believe how many established companies don’t market to their email lists. \n\nNo matter what business you’re in - physical location, web-based, service, B2B/c - your email list should be top of mind and integrated properly into every single marketing effort (ppc, mailers, tv, web and print).\n\nI be happy to answer questions (if there are any) related to email marketing.\n\n## Comment ID kcypl8v with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-12-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/jicl2v/how_does_a_local_service_business_generate_leads/kcypl8v/) (in reply to ID jicl2v):\nRelevant? https://101databroker.com/generating-leads-for-small-businesses/\n\n## Comment ID kgz4i75 with +1 score by [(Local-Growth-Experts, Reddit, 2024-01-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/jicl2v/how_does_a_local_service_business_generate_leads/kgz4i75/) (in reply to ID jicl2v):\nThe most successful way to get local leads as a small local business is first get a website. It’s important when building a website that it’s built with getting local traffic in mind. Then build a GOOGLE Business Profile, and have it optimized for attracting local customers as well. Be sure to include optimized images in your website as well. It’s very important to make sure all of your business information NAP (Name, Address & Phone) are exactly the same as well as your hours of operation on both your GBP and your website. \n\nGoogle likes consistent information. Having the same information also builds trust and GOOGLE rewards websites it considers trustworthy. You should then Build citations (other mini type profiles that mainly consist of your NAP, brief description of your business and a few photos as well as your hours of business. \n\nThis and some other strategies can get even a new website to rank on the first page of Google within 30-90 days depending on location, niche (business type) and competition. Once your on the first page of Google other strategies are employed to maintain the position. There are only 10 organic spots available on a Google page. Statistics from a recent poll say that the first page of Google gets 87-95% of all website clicks for any given niche in any particular location. The second page drops drastically to less than 6%. So as the old saying goes…if you’re not First your last & this truly applies to being on google. \nOr you can also run Google campaigns for paid ads, facebook and instagram advertising. But when running paid advertising campaigns these should be well thought out campaigns as well. GOOD campaigns not only get you a ton of local business leads but the better your campaigns the cheaper your ad spend. \nA business should have a good strategy for getting a consistent flow of quality local leads in order to stay busy and grow its business. Stay away from lead generation sites that sell leads to multiple business at the same time. These leads are typically a waste of time and can really eat into profits. \nReach out for more local lead getting strategies!\nHope this helps some local small businesses!",

There is a best tool for each use case, that will really depend on what kind of services you are offering to book. We do have an appointment booking solution, but it works better for services booking. For people looking for personal appointments, Calendly works really well.

      "# Post ID 2u1uap: For those of you running an appointment/booking based service businesses, what have you found to be the most successful scheduling system for your website? with +13 score by [(Aristartle, Reddit, 2015-01-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/2u1uap/for_those_of_you_running_an_appointmentbooking/)\nThere's some decent options out there, but I'm looking to upgrade. I build my sites on WP and can't seem to find one that fits the criteria I'm looking for.\n What I'd like is a calendar I can set availability on allowing them to click through and schedule that time period, with online CC payment for the time as well.\n\nI really like that setup for the user rather than drop down menus showing available times to use. Seeing the available times and days in an intuitive calendar is just so easy for the client...\n\nThanks!\n\n## Comment ID co4hfxq with +2 score by [(cleanr1, Reddit, 2015-01-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/2u1uap/for_those_of_you_running_an_appointmentbooking/co4hfxq/) (in reply to ID 2u1uap):\nI use Launch27.

You can limit the times available for booking based on service, staff, holidays or hours of operation, each person has their own schedule that is custom to them.\n\nYou can set notifications for more advanced stuff like reminders to clients and next-day follow-ups. It integrates with google calendar and automatically removes an appointment time once it is booked, and releases that time if the appointment is cancelled (you can include the cancellation link in the notification emails too). And, it looks really nice.\n\n### Comment ID co4q5tv with +1 score by [(Aristartle, Reddit, 2015-01-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/2u1uap/for_those_of_you_running_an_appointmentbooking/co4q5tv/) (in reply to ID co4n2xo):\nThis is interesting. Do you know if its possible to set the user interface to a calendar rather than just a grid of times? In the demo on their site you have to specify days your available and times then click through to a list of times to book. I'm wondering if instead of this you can just go straight to looking at a calendar with all availability.\n\n#### Comment ID co4r5ge with +1 score by [(AccountLancer, Reddit, 2015-01-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/2u1uap/for_those_of_you_running_an_appointmentbooking/co4r5ge/) (in reply to ID co4q5tv):\nI never wanted that function, so I really don't know.

Do you know why when going through the sign up options it says yoursitename.launch27.com? Because I was under the impression I would just get the code to install it as a plugin for wordpress, but that language seems like its something like weebly where you set up a site through launch27.\n\nThen I see your site seems to be standalone with launch 27 integrated.

      "# [Popular payment methods for small business owners by Bryan Simmons, Content on 2024-09-16](https://www.vcita.com/blog/payments/payment-methods-for-small-business)\nYou’re a small business owner looking to get paid quickly and without fuss. You want to make it as easy as possible for your customers to pay you, and keep payment fees to a minimum. But which payment methods should you offer, and how can you stop processing fees from mounting up?\n\nThe good news is that there are plenty of options. Accepting credit cards used to mean a clunky merchant account and heavy transaction fees, but not anymore. Mobile payments, online payment gateways, and popular third-party processors now offer small business owners like you affordable payment solutions to accept credit cards and manage cash flow.\n\nThis overview of payment options helps you make smart decisions about receiving payments and avoiding excessive transaction fees.\n\nAccepting credit and debit cards for your small business\n\nThe key benefits\n\nOffering credit and debit card payments is a must for small businesses today. Not only does it provide convenience for customers, but it can also boost your cash flow and increase sales. With mobile payment solutions and online payment gateways, accepting popular payment methods like credit cards has never been easier.\n\nGetting set up\n\nTo start accepting credit and debit cards, you’ll need a merchant account from a bank or payment processor. This allows you to receive electronic funds from customer’s bank accounts when they pay with cards. You’ll also need a payment gateway – software that securely transmits card data between you, the customer, and your merchant account provider. Many providers bundle the merchant account and payment gateway together as an all-in-one credit card processing solution.\n\nChoosing the right option\n\nThere are various ways to actually accept the card payments in person or online. For in-store purchases, you can use a simple card reader that connects to your mobile device or POS system. For ecommerce or invoicing, an online payment method integrated with your website or software is ideal. Popular options include Stripe, Square, PayPal, and services like vcita that bundle it all together. Just watch out for transaction fees that can eat into your profits.\n\nThe payoff\n\nWhile there are some upfront and ongoing costs, the ability to accept credit and debit card payments is worth it. Customers expect the convenience and flexibility of using their preferred type of payment method. Offering it can help you stand out, increase sales from impulse buys, and maintain a healthy cash flow.\n\nSetting up a merchant account and payment gateway\n\nOpen your merchant account\n\nTo accept credit and debit card payments, you’ll need a merchant account. Setting one up is pretty straightforward. You’ll apply to a merchant account provider, sharing details about your business. Once approved, you can start accepting popular payment types like Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover.\n\nChoose an online payment gateway\n\nAn online payment gateway is the virtual terminal that securely processes credit card payments for your business. It encrypts customer’s bank account info and connects with your merchant account to move funds. Many merchant account providers offer their own integrated payment gateways. Or you can opt for third-party solutions like PayPal, Stripe, or Square. They integrate seamlessly with e-commerce platforms and charge around 2.9% + $0.30 per online transaction. Just be sure any gateway you use is PCI compliant to protect customer data.\n\nConsider mobile payments\n\nLots of small business owners now accept mobile payments using smartphone card readers and apps. Solutions like Square, PayPal, and Clover allow you to securely accept chip or contactless payments like Apple Pay on the go.\n\nMind the fees\n\nOf course, all these online payment methods for small businesses come with transaction fees. Merchant account fees can range from a few cents plus a percentage for each sale. Same for mobile payment processors. Factori those credit card processing costs into your pricing to keep cash flow healthy.\n\nMobile and online payment options for small businesses\n\nConvenient payment solutions\n\nThese days, customers expect a seamless payment experience – whether shopping online or in person. As a small business owner, offering mobile and online payment options is crucial. It allows you to meet customer expectations and boost sales.\n\nAccept credit cards on-the-go\n\nA mobile credit card reader turns your smartphone or tablet into a virtual payment terminal. This pocket-sized device lets you accept credit and debit card payments anywhere – at events, markets, or customer locations. Just plug it into your device’s audio jack or connect via Bluetooth.\n\nPopular options like Square, PayPal Here, and Intuit GoPayment make it easy to start accepting plastic on your mobile. The fees are low, with rates around 2.7% per swiped transaction.\n\nStay flexible with virtual terminals\n\nVirtual terminals allow you to manually key in card details and accept payments over the phone, by mail, or in your office. Popular options include PayPal Virtual Terminal, Dharma, and Square Virtual Terminal. The fees are similar to online gateways.\n\nUnified payment solutions\n\nAll-in-one platforms like vcita consolidate mobile payments, online gateways, virtual terminals and more into one easy solution. This provides a centralized way to accept all major payment types – simplifying operations and cash flow tracking.\n\nPCI compliance: what small business owners need to know\n\nPCI compliance is crucial when accepting credit and debit card payments. It helps protect your customers’ sensitive data and builds trust. Failing to comply can lead to hefty fines, lawsuits, and damage to your reputation.\n\nWhat is PCI compliance?\n\nPCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) is a set of security standards for businesses that handle, store or transmit credit card data. It ensures that you have robust measures in place to safeguard cardholder information from theft or misuse.\n\nWhy it matters\n\nData breaches and fraud are on the rise. Customers want assurance their card details are safe with you. Being PCI compliant shows you take security seriously and value their privacy. It can give you an edge over competitors.\n\nKey requirements\n\nThe key compliance areas for PCI include:\n\nUsing PCI-approved payment gateways and card readers\n\nEncrypting transmission of cardholder data\n\nRestricting data access to employees who need it\n\nMaintaining secure systems and applications\n\nRegularly monitoring and testing networks\n\nEnsuring PCI compliance\n\nFor small merchants, PCI compliance starts with your payment processor or gateway provider. They’ll have a program and self-assessment questionnaires tailored to your needs. Work closely with them to implement best practices specific to your business.\n\nThe path to full PCI DSS compliance has some upfront costs. But it’s an investment that pays dividends through increased customer trust and avoiding costly data breaches down the road.\n\nChoosing the right payment processing solutions for your small business needs\n\nOffering the most popular payment methods\n\nAs a small business owner, offering convenient payment options is crucial for keeping your customers happy and your cash flow healthy. You want to make sure to offer the payment methods that your customers prefer.\n\nAccepting credit and debit cards is a must these days, as most customers prefer the convenience of plastic over cash. You’ll need a merchant account and payment gateway to process these transactions. Mobile payments like Apple Pay and Google Pay are also becoming increasingly popular, especially among younger customers.\n\nFinding the right fit\n\nNow that you know the options, it’s time to figure out which ones make sense for your business. Consider factors like the type of goods or services you offer, your average transaction amount, and how often you get paid.\n\nFor example, if you’re a mobile service provider like a plumber or landscaper, a card reader that accepts contactless payments on-the-go could be a game-changer. But if you run an online store, an e-commerce platform with a built-in payment gateway might be a better choice.\n\nKeeping it secure and affordable\n\nOf course, security and affordability are also key concerns. Look for PCI-compliant solutions that protect your customers’ data and don’t nickel-and-dime you with hidden fees. Many providers charge a flat monthly rate plus reasonable transaction fees, which can help you budget better.\n\nTools like vcita’s all-in-one business management software can streamline your payment process while meeting security standards. With options for online payments, invoicing, and accepting credit cards, it’s a versatile solution worth considering.\n\nThe right payment methods can boost sales",

      "# [Top 3 Appointment Scheduling Software: Comparison of Acuity Scheduling, vCita Online Scheduling and SimplyBook.me by Adam Goldberg on 2019-11-29](https://financesonline.com/top-3-appointment-scheduling-software/)\nWhat is the best appointment scheduling software?\n\nThe best appointment scheduling software is Acuity Scheduling. It has a flexible availability manager, which lets you block time slots or days on your calendar. With it, you can accept appointments around the clock. It also helps you increase bookings by integrating with Facebook, Instagram, as well as website building and hosting services.\n\nHave you ever lost a customer because you could not agree on an appointment time? Have you had days when you only had a few bookings? Perhaps you have encountered clients who opted not to show up to a meeting at the last minute?\n\nIf you answered ‘yes’ to any or all of those questions, there’s a good chance you may already be on the lookout for an appointment scheduling software. The only problem is you’re still undecided as to which one to subscribe to. That is understandable — there are numerous options, each with its unique set of features and tools.\n\nSo, to help you out, we prepared this article discussing the top 3 appointment scheduling software — Acuity Scheduling, vCita Online Scheduling, and SimplyBook.me. With this, you will get in-depth insights into the similarities and differences between these products in terms of features and pricing. After this, you should be able to decide which one ticks all the boxes for you.\n\nThe use of appointment scheduling tools is on the rise. In 2018 alone, the market was valued at $199.67 million. By 2026, experts predict that the global appointment scheduling market will hit $518.91 million.\n\nBusinesses, regardless of size, are increasingly relying on this kind of solution. One of the main reasons is convenience. For example, a customer can choose to set an appointment with a clinic for the following day, even after office hours. Meanwhile, an establishment can regularly fill its schedule book because it can accept appointments online at any given hour.\n\nAppointment scheduling software are also becoming popular because of their integration with social platforms. To put this into perspective, Facebook is now the biggest social network with 2.45 billion active users. The company also reports that 2.8 billion people use Facebook, Inc.’s core services every month. That includes Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger.\n\nThat said, for a business to attract bookings as well as nurture leads to increase sales, social media visibility is essential. However, integrating with other applications is just one capability an online appointment scheduler offers. There are others that are worthy of noting that can reduce no-shows and increase recurring visits, which we will discuss further below.\n\n1. Acuity Scheduling\n\nAcuity Scheduling serves to create a platform that works around the clock for you as an online scheduling assistant. It ensures that you take advantage of every appointment opportunity from a potential or existing client.\n\nTo that end, the appointment scheduling software empowers customers to self-schedule. Moreover, if they need to modify their selected time frame, they can do so. In fact, Acuity Scheduling enables them to change their appointments repeatedly. That is until they have settled on the best time.\n\nIn relation to this, clients can see your availability in real-time. So, whenever you make changes to your appointment book, they can see it immediately. As such, they can adjust their schedules accordingly. By doing so, you can give your clientele a heads up when you are available to serve them.\n\nKey features of Acuity Scheduling\n\nReal-time Appointment Availability\n\nClient Intake Forms\n\nCustom Appointment Confirmations and Reminders\n\nIntegration with Third-party Tools\n\n2. vCita Online Scheduling\n\nvCita Online Scheduling frees your time for other tasks with its online scheduling capabilities. Even when you are busy, you can continue booking appointments and managing them. This is because the appointment scheduling software is accessible to clients through the service portal.\n\nThere are other options for scheduling, too, such as through Facebook or your website. Whichever you opt to use, you can expect every appointment to appear in your calendar. It is not just any calendar, though, it is color-coded, enabling you to distinguish between services. Because of this, you have an idea of how your day would be like at a single glance.\n\nFurthermore, you can rest assured that you can check your schedule at any time. This is possible as vCita Online Scheduling can synchronize with your favorite calendar tool.\n\nIf you want to investigate the features closely you can easily do so when you sign up for vCita Online Scheduling free trial here.\n\nKey features of vCita Online Scheduling\n\nOn-the-Go Appointment Scheduling\n\nClient Portal\n\nColor-Coded Calendar\n\nAutomatic Schedule Confirmation\n\n3. SimplyBook.me\n\nSimplyBook.me reviews tell us that this is a simple online booking platform. Nevertheless, it offers robust features, beginning with its mobile-optimized booking website. You can make available services, service providers, and packages there.\n\nOn the same note, you can inform customers how much they need to pay. It is at this point that you can direct them to the page where they can pay for their bookings online. However, if that does not work for them, they can pay for services on-site through your POS.\n\nThen, you can entice them to come back and continue patronizing your business with automated “come back soon” messages.\n\nIf you want to know more about the features it has to offer, you can easily sign up for SimplyBook.me free trial here.\n\nKey features of SimplyBook.me\n\nMobile-Adaptable Booking Website\n\nSMS and Email Appointment Reminders\n\nBusiness Analytics\n\nIntegration and API\n\nComparison of Key Features\n\nScheduling tools\n\nAcuity Scheduling, vCita Online Scheduling, and SimplyBook.me all double as your always-online assistant. Through them, clients can book their appointments at any time. As a result, you can say goodbye to long email threads, text exchanges, and phone calls.\n\nHowever, when it comes to controlling your availability, Acuity Scheduling offers the most flexibility. It allows you to block specific time slots and even add personal tasks to your calendar. Of course, it still lets you control which sections of your calendar you want your customers to see.\n\nCompare that with vCita Online scheduling, which limits what you can do with your availability. It does let you set regular business hours and specific times on particular dates. However, when blocking off time, you have to do so manually.\n\nWhen it comes to appointment rescheduling, both Acuity Scheduling and vCita Online Scheduling gives your clients free rein. Despite that, you can set certain limitations to protect your business. For example, you can prevent rescheduling a day or two before the appointment.\n\nIn this regard, SimplyBook.me differs because it does not have a rescheduling or editing option. Instead, it allows customers to cancel the booking to make another one.\n\nVerdict: Both Acuity Scheduling and vCita Online Scheduling are a notch above SimplyBook.me when it comes to scheduling flexibility. Still, Acuity Scheduling wins this round because it has more configurations for scheduling control. You can see this in the time/date blocking, especially.\n\nClient management\n\nIn a nutshell, all top 3 appointment scheduling software have client management interfaces. And yet, each one has its own unique approach to the task.\n\nFor example, SimplyBook.me has simple client management tools. It lets you edit the client’s name, email, and phone number on one tab. You can also modify their SMS and email subscriptions on that page, too. On another, it shows the complete address.\n\nOn the other hand, Acuity Scheduling has a more comprehensive set of client management features. It shows the customer’s name, email, and contact number, together with notes and intake forms. The application enables you to manage appointments with the customer on their client page, as well. Additionally, you have the right to ban a person and explain to them why.\n\nLastly, vCita Online Scheduling has similar features, but with the addition of payments, documents, and conversations. The latter is especially helpful in having two-way exchanges with clients. You can use this as you would use a live chat software creatively for marketing.\n\nVerdict: vCita Scheduling has more tools on its client management window. But if you want to be able to ban a client without facing them, Acuity Scheduling is for you.\n\nSocial and web integration\n\nIntegrations are an essential aspect of any software, as it allows users to connect their favorite tools. With this, they can extend the functionalities of any platform. Acuity Scheduling, SimplyBook.me, and vCita Online Scheduling are no different.\n\nAcuity Scheduling can connect with Facebook and Instagram; two of the most used social platforms on the planet. Because of this, your target audience can set an appointment with you without leaving their favorite social sites.\n\nAdditionally, you can add your online scheduler to your website. The solution supports WordPress, Wix, Weebly, and Squarespace. Other platforms you can integrate your widget with are GoDaddy, Joomla!, Drupal, Webs, and Zenfolio.\n\nSimplyBook.me has a similar approach; it can integrate with Facebook but not with Instagram. Instead, it can connect with Line, a messaging app whose focus market is Asia. This is beneficial if you have clients in the region who prefer to use the app. In addition, you can add their booking widgets to your website.\n\nWith vCita Online Scheduling, you have a Facebook Pages integration as well as a website widget. Additionally, it helps you connect with a Google service called Reserve with Google. Through this, potential customers can book your services from Google Search, Google Maps, and Reserve with Google.\n\nVerdict: If you are looking to integrate with as many channels as possible, Acuity Scheduling is a strong choice. Its basic integrations already include Facebook and Instagram, as well as several platforms for website building and website hosting solutions. Should you need more, you can always connect with your Zapier account. Through this, you can interface with other messaging platforms like Telegram and WhatsApp.\n\nMarketing options\n\nThe volume of your appointments is directly related to your marketing efforts. The three online scheduling vendors we’re investigating here seem to understand this. This is evident in how they include marketing tools.\n\nWith vCita Online Scheduling, it is easy to find the marketing toolbox. It has ready-to-go automated campaigns, among which are birthday emails. Plus, you can add your own custom automated campaigns and use these email marketing trends for 2020 together with those. Furthermore, the application helps you promote your business with announcements. You can even schedule the delivery if you are just planning ahead.\n\nOn the other hand, the Acuity Scheduling and SimplyBook.me marketing tools are not as obvious. What they have are selections for coupons, subscriptions, and gift certificates. However, like vCita Online Scheduling, these two also offer support for email and SMS reminders, which also serve as marketing vehicles.\n\nVerdict: vCita Online Scheduling has the most focused collection of marketing tools. Moreover, just like Acuity Scheduling and SimplyBook.me, it has email and SMS reminders too.\n\nPricing\n\nAcuity Scheduling and SimplyBook.me both offer a free plan. One main difference between the two is the reminder messages. The former does not provide the feature while the latter does.\n\nAnother thing is customization. Acuity Scheduling gives you a simple, no-nonsense scheduling page while SimplyBook.me has an array of theming options. These are available when you are beginning to configure your booking site. And in case you change your mind later, you can also select another theme.\n\nRegarding pricing subscriptions, all three are scalable. But among them, SimplyBook.me has the most affordable basic package. On the other hand, Acuity Scheduling has more advanced features for its first-tier option. Meanwhile, vCita Online Scheduling has the priciest packages.\n\nVerdict: SimplyBook.me has a better free plan. In addition, it has a more affordable first-tier subscription package. However, Acuity Scheduling’s upper-tier tariffs are the least expensive.\n\nFind the Right Online Booking Software for You\n\nMore businesses today are adopting online booking. Specifically, hospitals and clinics are investing in these apps to meet the millennial market’s demand for convenience. Even restaurants are embracing the technology so they can better manage issues related to staffing.\n\nYou may even be experiencing a need for an online booking platform in your field. The top 3 appointment scheduling software we discussed are designed to meet the requirements of businesses in different industries. They have the important availability management features and have value-added tools that make them worth your investment.\n\nAmong the three, we believe Acuity Scheduling has the best value-for-money proposition. It has a free plan that is good for freelancers, small teams, and startups. Its pricing scheme is also the most advantageous — if you have a tight budget but want a comprehensive set of features, it would not disappoint.",

The app — which serves as both an all-in-one business-management and client-engagement tool — also offers a resource hub that’s chock full of articles and webinars on topics like money management, small-budget marketing, and more.\n\nAcuity Scheduling overview\n\nAcuity Scheduling — which markets itself as “more than just a scheduling tool” — is your personal online assistant, helping your business make phone tag a thing of the past.\n\nThanks to their customizable scheduling page, Acuity allows you and your customers to be in sync 24-7 through billing integration and calendar sharing.

If you’re looking to automate marketing campaigns or text with clients, you’ll need the Platinum plan at $99 per month for a team of two to four people.\n\nAcuity’s most basic plan, Emerging, is $16 per month and meant for one staff member or location. For teams of six or more, the Growing plan is most popular at $27 per month and offers almost all the same features as the $49 per month Powerhouse plan, which is best for larger teams of 36 people or more.\n\nBoth offer discounted rates if you opt to be billed annually instead of monthly.\n\nvcita vs Acuity Scheduling: Integrations\n\nvcita has native integrations with Zoom, Skype, QuickBooks, Google, Facebook, REST API, and POWr. Through Zapier, it integrates with some fan-favorite applications, including Salesforce and HubSpot.\n\nAcuity Scheduling integrates directly with calendar programs for Google, Outlook, and iCloud; email marketing programs Mailchimp and Drip; video conferencing tools Zoom and GoToMeeting; form builder Wufoo; CRM system Pipedrive; and various invoicing software (FreshBooks), conversion and referral tracking (Google Analytics), website builders (WordPress), and social media platforms. Through Zapier, Acuity can also connect to more than 200 other programs, including ActiveCampaign and Keap.\n\nvcita vs Acuity Scheduling: Approval workflows\n\nWhile both vcita and Acuity Scheduling help businesses streamline their approval workflows, vcita is a better fit for small or mid-sized companies, such as law and accounting firms. Acuity is equipped and designed for everything from small businesses to enterprises.\n\nJotform: An alternative to vcita and Acuity Scheduling\n\nSo, when comparing vcita vs Acuity, which is better for your business?\n\nBefore you decide, consider one more option: Jotform.\n\nJotform can handle billing, generate reports, and automate workflows, helping your business grow with the power of forms. With more than 10,000 customizable templates, Jotform allows you to quickly create reports, accept payments, and manage invoices.\n\nYou can analyze form submissions in Jotform Tables or use them to create workflows with Jotform Approvals. Plus, the Jotform Mobile Forms app lets you fill, approve, and send forms on the go.\n\nIn fact, Jotform offers many of the same templates, integrations, and features that both vcita and Acuity do, but at a fraction of the cost at just $34 per month at its most basic level. (You can even use it for free with the Starter plan.)\n\nTo help your business grow, you need the proper tools to make your work easier. Learning which ones are right for you is the first step toward setting yourself and your company up for continued success."
