      "# [Boosting Last-mile Model Performance: Increase mAP by 20% while reducing your dataset size by 25% with intelligent visual data curation by Ulrik Stig Hansen on 2023-12-14](https://encord.com/customers/automotus-customer-story)\nIntroducing Customer: Automotus\n\nAutomotus is leading the advancement of parking and traffic management solutions through the use of AI and computer vision technology.\n\nThe platform serves cities and airports to enhance street safety, sustainability, and efficiency by automating curbside operations, including parking, loading zones, zero-emission areas, bike lanes, and more.\n\nProblem: Large volume of data, expensive to label\n\nAutomotus faced challenges in managing their entire data pipeline for model development, including automating data curation, ensuring efficient AI-assisted labeling, and streamlining model evaluation processes.\n\nAfter first establishing a continuous annotation pipeline, the team faced a critical question: Among all the collected data, how could they ensure they were labeling the most relevant data? And, how would they identify such data?\n\nThe large volumes of de-identified images captured from hundreds of cameras presented an abundance of data. Labeling all of it would not necessarily improve model performance and would be prohibitively expensive.\n\nSolution: Use Encord to manage data pipeline\n\nUpon evaluating other tools, the Automotus team partnered with Encord to manage their entire data pipeline for model development, from automated data curation to AI-assisted labeling to model evaluation.\n\nHere's a look at their entire workflow:\n\nOne of the team’s first priorities was converting the vast amount of de-identified images into labeled training data.\n\nFrom scaling to enhancing your model development with data-driven insights\n\nLearn more\n\nResults: 35% reduction in the datasets' size for annotation\n\nLeveraging Encord, the team was able to visually inspect, query, and sort their datasets to eliminate undesirable low-quality data in just a few clicks.\n\nThis process resulted in a 35% reduction in the datasets' size for annotation. Consequently, the team achieved over a 33% reduction in their labeling costs.\n\nThe high model accuracy enabled Automotus to better serve and grow with their customers – presenting more accurate data to their clients: “From the modality distribution that happens at the street-level, to more accurate representations of the dwell times [and a few other metrics that we supply to our clients] – these base models are the ones driving these analytics.”\n\nHow does Encord compare to other tools on the market?\n\nThe team evaluated several other tools on the market but ultimately decided to partner with Encord for several reasons:\n\nFlexible Ontology Structure: Encord facilitated efficient object classification and tracking, allowing for straightforward ontology management and seamless training of both detection and classification models within a single project.\n\nQuality Control Capabilities: Encord's human-in-the-loop feedback mechanisms significantly enhanced annotation performance, particularly in identifying small objects within frames.\n\nAutomated Labeling Features: The ability to label a few frames and use assisted labeling to speed up the process, reducing the need for manual labeling of every frame, was highly advantageous.\n\nThe Automotus AI team notes: “For example, a shortcoming with other tools was the quality of the labels: we’d occasionally realize bounding boxes would be tighter or too wide around the objects they were identifying, or objects wouldn’t be classified correctly within frames. Now, we can select the sampling rate of frames that we want to move towards a review process, and share real-time context with annotators so that they can also power our model performance. This human-in-the-loop approach means we can use Encord to help our annotators perform annotations better, which in turn speeds up how quickly we can improve our model performance. We are able to localize objects better and increase accuracy.”",
      "# [Floy Reduced CT & MRI Annotation Time with AI-Assisted Labeling by Ulrik Stig Hansen on 2022-12-09](https://encord.com/customers/floy-customer-story)\nFloy develops AI that helps radiologists detect critical incidental findings in medical images. Floy partners with radiologists who use their medical expertise to annotate data used for training diagnostic models. When other annotation tools didn’t provide the flexibility or speed that radiologists need, Floy turned to Encord to improve its medical-imaging annotation process.\n\nIntroducing Customer: Floy\n\nFloy’s technology scans radiological images to detect abnormalities, providing a second pair of eyes for radiologists. Radiologists have to interpret and make diagnoses from complex images, such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs. They are highly skilled medical professionals, but they’re also human, and their diagnoses are vulnerable to human error.\n\nRadiologists can make perceptual errors, in which they overlook abnormality, and interpretive errors in which they identify an abnormality but draw the wrong conclusions. Because radiologists have a tremendous workload – sometimes hundreds of images a day – perceptual errors account for 80 percent of diagnostic radiology errors.\n\nFloy’s AI helps solve the perceptual error problem for inpatient and outpatient radiologists. After radiologists complete reading of scans, they use Floy’s product to screen for abnormalities – such as tumors or metastasis – in spinal scans. The AI will alert the doctors to abnormal patterns that may have been overlooked by the human eye, requesting that they double check the scan before making a declarative diagnosis.\n\nFrom scaling to enhancing your model development with data-driven insights\n\nLearn more\n\nProblem: Unreliable and Inflexible Tools for Radiologists\n\nDeveloping high-quality medical AI products depends on having high-quality training data. Having processes in place for obtaining consistent, high-quality annotations is of great importance.\n\nFloy tried working with open source labeling tools for medical images, but they didn’t have an option for building efficient workflows or sharing data across a team of radiologists. Floy’s radiologists had to download images locally, annotate them using the open source tool, and re-uploaded the image segmentations back to Floy. This unscalable, cumbersome process wasted radiologists’ precious time, decreasing productivity and increasing the likelihood of errors.\n\nThe off-the-shelf annotation platforms Floy tried contained cloud-based features and allowed users to structure workflows, but they didn’t have specialized annotation features when labeling DICOM images. Radiologists couldn’t annotate seamlessly in these platforms without encountering issues, and some of these tools had bugs which caused image labels to shift location, meaning the radiologists had to redo hours of work.\n\nFloy needed a training data tool that enabled high-quality labeling as well as efficient workflow structuring and labeling. The company also needed a tool that made key employees happy.\n\n“Radiologists are highly specialized, well educated doctors. Radiological annotators have a separate and rare skill: the ability to interpret medical images and perform accurate segmentation,” explains Leander Märkisch, Co-Founder and Managing Director of Floy. “This skillset makes them hard to find. With inefficient data labeling processes, we have to find and employ more of them to develop our product. With cumbersome products that cause frustration, we run the risk of losing talented annotators.”\n\nImage annotation is also the most time consuming and expensive part of product development for medical AI, so labeling efficiency is key for keeping costs down.\n\nSolution: DICOM Image Specialization and Quality Control Features\n\nLooking for a tool that enabled DICOM image annotation and improved workflows for radiologists, Floy turned to Encord’s collaborative data labeling platform.\n\nEncord’s DICOM annotation tool can render 20,000+ pixel intensities as opposed to existing tools that manage just 256. Created specifically for medical image labeling, the technology perfectly fits Floy’s annotation needs.\n\nAnnotating DICOM images in Encord with windowing pre-set set to 'bone'\n\nFor data privacy reasons, Floy needed to work with a German cloud provider. Encord built out integrations with Open Telekom so that Floy could store patient data on local servers while still streaming it quickly into Encord’s platform for annotation.\n\nEncord’s user-friendly platform enables radiologists to move quickly from image slice to image slice, and it creates a workflow that prioritizes images by order of importance. It also allows reviewers and annotators to collaborate so that annotators can leave notes for reviewers, and reviewers can provide annotators with modified labels and feedback, helping them to improve.\n\nUsing Encord’s quality assessment tool, Floy’s team has visibility into the entire annotation and review process. Not only does this tool help ensure that labels are of the highest possible quality, it also provides Floy’s team with insights about the annotators themselves. For instance, if one annotator produces consistently low-quality labels, Floy’s team can have them retrained. They can also see whether an annotator performs better on certain scan types and then adjust their annotation tasks according to their strengths.\n\nAnnotator management dashboard in Encord\n\nResults: Higher-quality Data in Less Labeling Time\n\nWith Encord, Floy has built a scalable workflow process that results in high-quality annotated data that feeds back into its models.\n\nUsing Encord’s platform, Floy’s annotation team has labeled 5,100 scans, each containing between about 16 to 200 images, or a total of approximately 60,000 images. Equally important, Floy’s annotators are very happy when using the product. The time it takes for them to label images has reduced by approximately 50 percent for CT scans and 20 percent for MRI scans.\n\nEncord’s platform also facilitates new types of collaboration beyond those between annotators and reviewers.\n\n“Our ML engineers and product managers also use the platform,” says Märkisch. “Because everyone has visibility into the training data pipeline, our conversations have changed. We no longer have to ask annotators for general updates about the labeling process. We can instead use our insights about the annotation process to have discussions about product development timeline and make better business decisions.”\n\nFloy and Encord’s teams have benefited from close collaboration. The two companies solve problems together in real time. When Floy has provided feedback about the product from radiologists or data engineers, Encord’s team implemented features and improvements based on that feedback.\n\nWorking with Encord, Floy can be certain that it’s training its models on high-quality data so that it can build great products that serve patients. As the company expands and builds technology that works with new modalities and different body parts, Encord’s platform can help them ramp up their training data processes to develop new products quickly.",
      "# [Reducing MRI and CT Annotation Time by 70% for Rapid AI by Ulrik Stig Hansen on 2023-02-08](https://encord.com/customers/rapid-ai-customer-story)\nRapidAI develops AI that helps medical professionals identify and provide treatment for stroke victims. The company works with multiple annotators to label vast datasets of medical imaging. When managing the annotation and review process for large projects became unwieldy, the company turned to Encord’s platform for a seamless, centralized annotation experience.\n\nIntroducing Customer: RapidAI\n\nFor decades, doctors believed that only patients who sought care within a few hours of suffering a stroke would benefit from treatment. However, Dr. Greg Albers and Dr. Roland Bammer thought that with better technology, the window for care could be extended and more people with cerebrovascular disorders could be saved.\n\nWhen diagnosing stroke patients, doctors use perfusion and diffusion imaging. However, perfusion imaging is a complicated process: obtaining the results is time-consuming, and perfusion scans provide a lot of information that doctors must compile and analyze quickly. If doctors had more immediate access to a summary image that provided meaningful information, they could quickly identify patients who would benefit from care, extending the time frame for treatment.\n\nIn 2012, Albers and Bammer founded RapidAI. Building on the technology they’d developed at Stanford University; the company provides brain imaging software tools designed to help doctors extract greater meaning from patient data. By creating high-quality images from diffusion and perfusion data, RapidAI’s technology assists neurovascular and vascular teams in making faster, more accurate diagnoses and treatment decisions.\n\nIn support of the founding mission, RapidAI has analyzed more than 7 million scans. The company is the exclusive advanced neuroimaging partner for the World Stroke Organization, and today, more than 2,000 hospitals in 100-plus countries use the Rapid platform to diagnose cerebrovascular disorders, such as strokes and aneurysms.\n\nProblem: Managing Annotations for High-Volume Data Projects\n\nTo train a model, RapidAI’s machine learning teams need thousands of labeled CT, CTA, MR, and MRA images. Each training project consists of about 500 cases, with between 30 and 200 CT image slices per case. If the case contains CTA scans, that number is closer to 1000 slices.\n\nRapidAI’s annotation team consists of many highly trained annotators – with several board-certified diagnostic radiologists and subspecialists acting as reviewers. Initially, open-source labeling tools were used. As the project grew in complexity and size, the need for a robust management system and a seamless export process became essential so the company began to look for an online platform that could help them manage the annotation and review process more efficiently.\n\nSolution: A Centralized Platform with Annotation Review and Interpolation Features\n\nRapidAI tried out several online annotation vendors when looking for an online platform to manage and label training data.\n\n“We went through the process of trying out each platform– uploading a test case and labeling a particular pathology,” says Dr. Ryan Mason, a neuroradiologist overseeing annotations at RapidAI. “Encord made it very easy to centrally keep track of annotations, including who had made them and who had reviewed them. It also had this great interpolation tool which was especially useful for the projects we were working on.”\n\nFor particular diseases, the shape of the pathology changes substantially in the peripheral slices of a case. In the middle slices, however, it maintains a uniform shape. With Encord’s interpolation tool, when RapidAI’s annotators reach the middle slices, they only have to label one out of every five images. Encord’s DICOM annotation tool captures the shape of the pathology, interpolating the label on the slices the annotators skipped. In a case with 100 slices, annotators only have to label about 30 images.\n\nEncord’s reviewer function also helped RapidAI improve the efficiency of its annotation process. Using this feature, neuroradiologists can leave notes for annotators, correcting mistakes and providing guidance for improvement. They can also reject a case and label it directly. That way, annotators can then compare their original work against a reviewer’s to identify and learn from their makes. This feature is especially useful because as the team is gathering the labeled data they need, they are simultaneously teaching annotators to improve their labeling skills.\n\nResults: More Efficient Data Labeling Processes\n\nWith Encord’s interpolation tool, Rapid AI’s team has increased the speed at which they can label data resulting in as much as a 30-minute reduction in annotation time per case.\n\nEncord and RapidAI’s team communicate directly on Slack, and should RapidAI encounter a bug or issue, Encord responds immediately and fixes it within a few hours. Encord’s team has also worked with them to customize the product to meet their annotation needs.\n\n“One of my favorite things about using Encord’s platform is how involved their team is with their customers,” says Mason. “For instance, when we started this project, I told them we liked to use Wacom tablets for drawing our annotations. Encord’s platform wasn’t set up for that, but their team asked to hop on a call so they could learn more. Within about two days, they released an update that made their platform compatible with the pads.”\n\nRapid AI is in the process of expanding its technology to additional disease states, such as pulmonary embolisms. As they expand, the company will continue to build out a pipeline of projects that each require annotating thousands of MRI and CT scans. By working with a centralized platform that effectively manages the annotation process and speeds up labeling, the company can increase the speed at which its AI enters production and, ultimately, saves lives.",
      "# [Reducing Model False Positive Rate from 6% to 1% with Vida ID by Ulrik Stig Hansen on 2022-11-22](https://encord.com/customers/vida-id-customer-story)\nVida, a full-service verified digital identity platform, serves customers throughout Southeast Asia. While facial recognition is a mature technology, most open-source facial recognition datasets aren’t reflective of the region’s populations. Models trained on these datasets perform poorly, so Vida needs to build and manage new own datasets. Using Encord’s platform, Vida can oversee a large labeling team and annotate tens of thousands of images quickly.\n\nIntroducing Customer: Vida\n\nVida uses optical character recognition and computer vision technology to provide a full-service verified digital identity platform. Digital verification empowers people to participate in the economy. For instance, financial institutions require identity verification to reduce fraud and ensure that assets arrive in the correct accounts, and ride-hailing services require drivers to verify their identity.\n\nOperating mainly in Indonesia, Vida’s services enable banks, fintechs, online trading platforms, ride-hailing companies, and other companies to verify the identity of users online.\n\nIndonesia is the biggest archipelago in the world, and traveling long distances can be challenging. With digital verification, customers no longer have to spend time waiting or traveling to get their identities verified. Vida users take a photo of themselves and a photo of their identification document. Vida’s technology then confirms the authenticity of the document, and compares the document to the photo and an authoritative source to verify the user's identity.\n\nThroughout Indonesia, a digital signature must be accompanied by identity verification. Being able to sign documents and open bank accounts online is incredibly beneficial, especially for micro-entrepreneurs and SMEs in rural areas. Vida’s platform reduces barriers for these populations when accessing financial products like loans and savings accounts.\n\nProblem: Large Datasets, Large Labeling Teams\n\nVida trains its computer vision models to predict the liveness of an image. The models learn to determine whether the image contains a physically present person or whether the image contains a fake representation of a person, such as a pre-taken photo or a 2D mask.\n\nAlthough facial recognition is a mature technology, most of the open-source facial verification datasets contain faces from the Western Hemisphere or East Asia. When models train on these datasets, they don’t perform well on Southeast Asian demographics. Indonesia is also a majority Muslim country, so many women wear a hijab, an attribute rarely encountered by models that train on these open-source datasets.\n\nTo improve model performance, Vida began collecting and annotating new datasets– ones reflective of Southeast Asian populations. The company needed a platform that could help them label and manage the tens of thousands of new images collected.\n\nVida’s team tried using some open source tools, but none of them allowed for managing a labeling team. Furthermore, facial verification data contains sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII), and Vida struggled to find a tool that gave them strong access control and the ability to keep customer data on their own servers.\n\nSolution: Flexible Platform, Iterative Process\n\nWith Encord’s platform, Vida could easily set up a system for managing their 20-person labeling team. They have key managers who oversee the other annotators as well as reviewers. When a new annotator comes on board, Vida uses Encord’s tools to evaluate the new annotations and ensure that all labels are high quality.\n\nVida’s work requires managing a lot of images – about 60,000 in a project. At first, Encord’s interface was showing all 60,000 at once, which created challenges around speed. However, after Vida gave Encord’s team feedback, they quickly changed the UI so that Vida could scale up the amount of images in each project.\n\n“I’ve been very impressed with how Encord iterates on the SDK, listens to feedback, and constantly improves the product,” says Jeffrey Siaw, VP of Data Science at Vida.\n\nWith Encord, Vida can keep the data in their own Amazon S3 buckets, alleviating data privacy concerns about access and storage. Rather than require that data be stored on its own servers, Encord’s platform facilitates the use of a signed URL allowing it to access and retrieve the data from a customer’s preferred storage facility without storing data locally.\n\nResults: Increased Labeling Speed, Decreased False Acceptance Rate\n\nIn the first month of using Encord, Vida’s team labeled 70,000 images at a rate much faster than they expected.\n\nWhen trained on the old datasets, Vida’s previous models had a false acceptance rate– they predicted that an image was of a physically present person when it was not– of six percent.\n\nFalse acceptances can have serious implications for Vida’s customers. For banks, a false verification could result in the opening of a fraudulent account. In ride hailing companies, it can increase the chance of robbery because a driver with a criminal record is onboarded using a false identity.\n\nWith Encord, Vida improved the quality of their datasets, and the new models had a false acceptance rate of only one percent.\n\n“Using Encord’s platform, we were able to train our new models on much better datasets with much higher quality labels, reducing our false acceptance rate to only one percent” says Jeffrey Siaw, VP of Data Science.\n\nAs Vida continues to grow, the data science team will begin taking a more granular approach in their data management and labeling. They’ll try labeling faces differently and label attributes such as religious headdresses to better track how their models perform across more specific demographic features.\n\nUsing Encord, they can label these datasets at speed while managing multiple projects with different types of labels and ontologies, all in one platform.\n\nReady to automate and improve the quality of your data labeling?",
      "# [Accelerating Diagnosis to Treatment with Encord by Ulrik Stig Hansen on 2023-09-18](https://encord.com/customers/viz-customer-story)\nViz.ai’s revolutionary technology empowers medical teams to save lives through early detection and care coordination. The award-winning health tech company leverages Encord to accelerate processes, improve accuracy of diagnosis, and streamline collaboration among clinical AI teams. Encord’s medical training data platform and services have leveled up Viz.ai’s capabilities. They are now able to analyze data quickly and enter new areas of medical research.\n\nIntroducing Customer: Viz.ai\n\nViz.ai uses artificial intelligence to speed up care and improve patient outcomes. The San Francisco-based health tech company uses its software to ingest patient data and images in real-time and use regulatory-approved AI algorithms to detect disease and notify the appropriate medical team. This allows early detection of large vessel occlusion strokes, aneurysms, pulmonary embolism, and other critical diseases. It alerts doctors and nurses, who can see the images on their phones, saving hours of the time it would otherwise take to get that patient to diagnosis and treatment.\n\nTheir slogan “time is brain” speaks to the heart of their mission. Every minute that passes during a stroke, 2 billion brain cells die, so early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial.\n\nViz.ai’s success in aiding medical teams to rapidly detect diseases has allowed them to help enhance and preserve the quality of patients’ lives. And, with more success, comes more responsibility. The healthcare tech company has been rapidly growing and is constantly developing more solutions to support clinical teams worldwide. Viz.ai is now expanding into cardiovascular diseases with a recent approval by the FDA of AI-powered software for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, an often missed but potentially deadly condition.\n\nProblem: Time-consuming data comparison & need for team collaboration\n\nEarly detection of a stroke, for instance, is possible thanks to Viz.ai’s abundance of data. By accessing and comparing scans with their multiple medical databases, the accuracy of their products is top of the range. However, for their teams, this has also translated into a lot of manpower and time consumed.\n\nPreviously, the clinical AI teams at Viz.ai relied on an in-house annotation platform to analyze and label medical data obtained from outside resources. “However, it lacked several features to enhance and streamline team collaboration,” explains Maayan Gerbi, Clicinal AI Specialist. “We desired more automated annotation features to track progress amongst teams and lower maintenance.”\n\nIt was time to search for a new solution that could support Viz.ai’s ambitious and fast-growing teams.\n\nSolution: Encord providing management & tracking for large volumes of data\n\nAfter considering multiple annotation solutions, it was clear that Encord was the best fit for their needs. What stood out for Viz.ai was Encord’s highly responsive team, top-notch annotation features, as well as the user-friendly interface of the platform.\n\n“Encord’s robust support system has been remarkable. Whenever questions or issues come up, they are always supportive and helpful. This ensures that our workflows remain uninterrupted,” said Maayan. Encord’s helpful and reliable team also facilitated a smooth integration. “The annotation platform is well designed for compatibility and interpretability. We were able to effectively align it with the current systems,” added Data Manager Sarit Meshesha.\n\nFrom project management, tracking, and monitoring to organizing large volumes of data in a user-friendly manner, Encord’s capabilities empower teams to annotate more speedily and accurately. Viz.ai particularly highlights the interpolation tool. “Encord constantly impresses us with the ability to think outside the box,” says Maayan. “The interpolation tool is a sophisticated, semi-automatic labeling tool that has proven to be a significant time saver for our team by reducing labeling time and improving precision.”\n\nResults: Less manual work & higher-quality data\n\nEncord is now an integral part of Viz.ai’s workflow. The platform’s range of innovative features has allowed teams to take on more projects while staying organized. Additionally, the accuracy of the automatic and semi-automatic annotation features means less manual work and higher-quality data. The clinical AI teams can now expedite processes and review medical imaging more quickly.\n\nThe collaborative features have also proven beneficial. Viz.ai now experiences more effective communication amongst teams and better project management end-to-end. Maayan explains, “The division of tasks and clear role assignment ensures organized workflows and the ability for team members to consult certain cases with experts along the way.”"

      "# Post ID g6r0yv: [D] Scale AI- what separates them, and why are they worth $1 billion? with +58 score by [(catandDuck, Reddit, 2020-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/g6r0yv/d_scale_ai_what_separates_them_and_why_are_they/)\nI recently heard of [Scale AI](https://scale.com/), and overall I am confused.\n\nFrom what I understand, they help you create training data by providing accurate labels for your images, videos, and text. You send data via an API call, their system makes a guess, and a human will give the final check. So essentially, semi-supervised learning as a service (SLaaS, you're welcome). It's being used by huge companies like OpenAI, Baidu, AirBnB.\n\nI guess my question is.. why is it so valuable? They have clearly simplified the workflow for gathering training data through their platform and human outsourcing. But what makes their method special? Why can't another company replicate it- it seems like a project magnitudes cheaper than $1 billion.\n\nIs the initial estimation algorithm proprietary and does it hold a lot of their value? Is the efficiency and accuracy of their human-labelling side unmatched?\n\nNote: these are genuine questions and should not be read as if they're rhetorical.\n\n## Comment ID focowkl with +21 score by [(igorsusmelj, Reddit, 2020-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/g6r0yv/d_scale_ai_what_separates_them_and_why_are_they/focowkl/) (in reply to ID g6r0yv):\nScale is not the only company doing annotation. There's a whole list here:  https://data-annotation.com/list-of-data-annotation-companies \nPlayment and Scale (both doing similar services) have been part of YCombinator. Other companies such as Appen already IPOd years ago. They started with simple outsourcing tasks.\n\nThere is now a new wave of startups trying to improve the workflow and tools of such outsourcing tasks using ML. At the same time they each try to build a platform out of it. At the moment they might be replaceable but if one manages to succeed they might become some sort of standard for everyone. \nThat's at least how I would see it.

Sure, there are many \"if\"s involved, but imho there is a chance a large portion of low-sophistication, off-the-shelve \"data science\" work (collect some data in a pandas dataframe, run some default scikit learn models to make predictions, make some shiny visualizations) will eventually include fine-tuning sota models in a supervised fashion to include knowledge extracted from text (and images?). Thus compared to today, there would be far more companies requireing labeing data.\n\nIf something like this happens, my (sad) experience is that if there is some company offering labeling as a service that lists a few major players as its customers, that can be enough to make execs prefer them. **If** something like this happens, I think Scale AIs headstart and marketing may actually be enough to make them really profitable regardless of if competitors are offer similar or even slightly better services.\n\nApart from that, obviously I would not rule out hype and overvaluation as mentioned in other comments.\n\n### Comment ID fofaf5i with +3 score by [(catandDuck, Reddit, 2020-04-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/g6r0yv/d_scale_ai_what_separates_them_and_why_are_they/fofaf5i/) (in reply to ID foexn8o):\nThis is an interesting perspective and it makes sense generally.

Nowadays I would use Streamlit, a python library which is getting very popular and seems very promising to me. The pro and cons is that you need to implement the labeling tool, but it shouldn't be too hard. On the other side, you have full control of the tool and integrate labeling with visualization.\n\nFinally, if you have money to spend, I suggest using AWS mechanical turk or ground-truth which gives you the tool and does the annotating for you, at a cost of course.\n\n### Comment ID g4fj0e0 with +1 score by [(Newtype_Beta, Reddit, 2020-09-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/ioraii/data_labelling_visualisation_tools/g4fj0e0/) (in reply to ID g4fho16):\nThanks for the insights. I've never used Sloth but heard about it. What limitations did you have?\n\nIs your data stored in the cloud or on local machines? I presume you would need to write some code to import for this in Streamlit for every dataset. We tend to store our data in AWS S3 so currently have some glue code that we slightly tweak depending on the dataset. I am trying to get us to use consistent folder hierarchies etc to minimise this friction.\n\nIt actually seems daunting to implement the labelling tool in Streamlit but I could be wrong. I tend to use Jupyter notebooks to visualise my data but it feels more restrictive than a web UI for instance. In your case did you decide to do everything yourself because you had the time or could not afford the cost for data labelling agencies? Also how big is your dataset?\n\nThere are some emerging online platforms like Scale but it's too expensive for us, and I couldn't find a good online tool for small startups. Mechanical turk would not be cheap either for us...\n\n#### Comment ID g4flyhs with +2 score by [(BBDante, Reddit, 2020-09-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/ioraii/data_labelling_visualisation_tools/g4flyhs/) (in reply to ID g4fj0e0):\nI was in an academic environment, so I only annotated a small dataset and had free labor XD My data were stored locally and Sloth was good enough for a dataset of a couple thousand images, but it definitively does not scale to bigger datasets: for example, all the results are stored in a single json file and I had to copy and paste between files every time something was wrong.

There's a free trial.\n\nFree tools have a hidden cost that pops up when your data grows in scale. You can't manage a team of labellers through them unless you host it, after which it starts to erode your own internal time.\n\nDepending on what kind of data or labelling schema you'll be using make sure that the tools and formats are there for the long run\n\n### Comment ID g4l4hhu with +2 score by [(Newtype_Beta, Reddit, 2020-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/ioraii/data_labelling_visualisation_tools/g4l4hhu/) (in reply to ID g4fjrmy):\nHad never come across v7lab's Darwin.

Are you a student looking get your hands dirty on your first computer vision project? Are you a scrappy start-up with no funding, or a scale-up/enterprise with a large team?\n\n**Problem statement**: What is the complexity of the tasks you’re solving? Do you need multiple annotation types (bounding boxes, polygons etc.), do you need to annotate complex satellite imagery or medical DICOM files? \n\n **Annotation team:** How many people will be annotating from your team or externally? If >3 I would highly recommend to go with a tool that has stated collaboration features and support multiple project folders. \n\n**Annotation quality control:** What level of control do you need? 2-3 review stages with multiple experts in the mix? Options to benchmark your annotations against a certain ground truth? Make sure to select a tool that support your current and future Quality control needs. \n\n**Scalability:** Are you going to annotate 10,000 images? 100,000? or maybe millions? Look at the data orchestration and management of tools before purchasing anything. \n\n**Integrations:** Most team I work with are looking for simple integrations with S3, Azure, GCP, but if you require specific custom integrations or on-prem deployments I would talk make sure to talk to the solutions engineering team first.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are many image annotation tools available, and the best one for you will depend on your specific needs and requirements. Some popular paid options include Labelbox, Encord, Segment, and Scale, and open-source options include Label Studio, 3D slicer, and CVAT.\n\nIt is recommended to try a few different tools and evaluate which one works best for you, in terms of the points mentioned above.",

Even if you don't use it, I would love to hear your thoughts to help me design the feature. My canonical example is make -> model -> year for vehicles.\n\nMy initial thoughts for the design - you start by making your labels, you create categories, you add labels to categories, you then add labels as children of other labels. Essentially a directed acyclic graph.\n\nA concrete example, you create the labels `ford`, `jeep`, `wrangler`, `f150`, `2002-2005`, `2018-2022`. You create the categories `make`, `model`, `year`. Add `ford` and `jeep` to `make`, add `f150` and `wrangler` to `model`, and you add `2002-2005` and `2018-2022` to `year`.\n\nYou would then make `f150` a child of `ford`, `wrangler` a child of `jeep`, the body year `2002-2005` a child of `f150`, and `2018-2022` a child of `wrangler`.\n\nWhen labeling you would then be presented with all the labels grouped at the top of the DAG, and based on which you selected it could filter down the next set. You would be able to select multiple and the next set would be the children of all that selected.\n\nThe tricky thing is I can't really enforce 1 or N per category in a straight forward way, so you could always select multiple. Does this sound like it would meet your needs? It is really tough to design while keeping it generic and applicable to multiple use cases. I haven't seen any other tool with this though, even multi label is rare. \n\nThe categories aren't super relevant here, they are just a meta-tag for organizing labels. The exist largely for the case where there is no label hierarchy, but will be helpful for the hierarchy as well.\n\n### Comment ID imjtz8k with +1 score by [(MrKebuky, Reddit, 2022-08-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/x1eteu/tool_for_data_annotation_taxonomy/imjtz8k/) (in reply to ID imhq5r8):\nSounds interesting if i did understand you correctly.

Scrolling through  the paper is a bit overwhelming  and it goes beyond my current  understanding of the topic.\n\nI'm  not an  ML researcher, but I can answer this. Note that this is not  information  from the paper, just my own findings from following the  \"scene\".\n\nWe  actually figured out  spelling not long after diffusion models came out,  the imagen paper  that came several months before SD1 explained how they  did it, which is  the same technique SD3 and Dalle3 use, instead of  using CLIP's text  encoder, they use T5.\n\nThe reason  why image  models can't spell is the same reason why language models  also have  difficulty spelling. Tokenization. Simply speaking instead of  seeing  each letter individually, we split a sentence into sub-words,  most  commonly called tokens and that's what the model sees. The model  never  gets to see each letter individually. But it turns out that if  you make  the model big enough and feed it enough data, it actually  learns how  each token is spelled out.\n\nClip  is both small (200-500M params)  and trained on limited text data (only  image captions). T5 is trained on  a large corpus of data and is also  huge (\\~5.5B params). This makes T5  the obvious choice if you care about  spelling.\n\nSo why use CLIP in  the  first place? Simple: it's much easier to train on clip embeddings  than  T5 embeddings, not only are they smaller, but because clip is  trained  on text/image pairs and due to backpropagation, the text  embeddings  also contain a lot of visual semantic information. This  simplifies a  lot of the work the text->diffusion attention modules  need to do.  Another reason is that T5 is absolutely massive, it's 5x  larger than  the image part of the model and 10-20x larger than CLIP.\n\nIf   you take a close look at diagram (a) in the paper you'll actually see   that SD3 uses both CLIP and T5, not only that but they trained it in a   way that makes the encoder used optional, so you can use the CLIP  models  only if you don't care about spelling and image composition  (CLIP is  also bad at understanding prompts), which is useful because  most GPUs  can't handle T5 on it's own. Tho I suspect someone will  distil T5 so it  becomes 5-10 times smaller than it currently is at a  minimal loss on how  good it is for prompting.\n\n## Comment ID ktr5hat with +4 score by [(crawlingrat, Reddit, 2024-03-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1b8ng6q/sd3_the_latest_multimodal_diffusion_transformer/ktr5hat/) (in reply to ID 1b8ng6q):\nWhen they mention the variations of SD3 does this mean that the versions that could possibly fit on 12VRAM or 16VRAM would be  weaker then the one that fits on the 24VRAM? Or does it not make a difference?\n\n### Comment ID ktsdv77 with +6 score by [(Apprehensive_Sky892, Reddit, 2024-03-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1b8ng6q/sd3_the_latest_multimodal_diffusion_transformer/ktsdv77/) (in reply to ID ktr5hat):\nDisclaimer, not an expert, so everything I say could be wrong 😅\n\nWell, obviously something has to give.\n\nThe 24GiB is probably fp32, so by switching to ft16, maybe it can run in 16GiB.\n\nThe T5 text encoder (a lightweight LLM) has 5.5B parameters, and it is optional. Without it, running with 12GiB is probably possible, without signification loss in prompt following and text/font rendering.\n\nAnything less than 12GiB probably either have to slow down rendering by swapping part of the model out, or by running some version of the model with fewer parameters (the models can be anywhere from 800M to 8B parameters).\n\nThese SD3 \"light\" models with smaller parameter will almost certainly suffer in terms of number of concepts/idea they \"understand\" and prompt following.  Quality will probably be similar to that of SDXL.\n\nThe even bigger problem is that presumably all these different versions will be incompatible in terms of LoRAs, TIs, etc.  So a version (most likely the big 8B version) will be dominant, and the other version will have less support.  But who know, maybe the training will be easy enough that model maker will make multiple versions form the same dataset, as the hard work of collection images and captioning them have been done already.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit**: Now that I think about the numbers a bit more, I think SAI is already running with fp16 instead of ft32.  That's because the DiT module + the two clip is 8B parameters and T5 is 5B, so assuming everything is loaded, that's 13 \\* 2 (2 bytes per each ft16 weight) = 26GiB of VRAM.\n\nSo without T5, it will be down to 8\\*2 = 16GiB.  So to make it runnable with 12GiB part of the model will have to be swapped in and out of VRAM, thus slowing it down.\n\n#### Comment ID kttyfk4 with +2 score by [(MoridinB, Reddit, 2024-03-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1b8ng6q/sd3_the_latest_multimodal_diffusion_transformer/kttyfk4/) (in reply to ID ktsdv77):\nAccording to the paper, running without the T5 does result in a loss of quality, especially with textual rendering.

      "# Post ID 1d7li52: Correcting some misinformation about being able to \"just train in\" non-existent concepts to SD3 with +8 score by [(campingtroll, Reddit, 2024-06-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1d7li52/correcting_some_misinformation_about_being_able/)\nI am very excited to see the SD3 model being released at all, but I just wanted to clarify some things to set expectations, because I am seeing a lot of misinformation being spread about being able to \"just train nsfw in to SD3\" on like 50-100 images like it was with SDXL.\n\nI keep seeing this point made but it's fundamentally wrong. The base model makes all of the difference when training in a new concept, it has to have at least something similar to work with. So thats why everyone keeps talking about yoga and gymnastics because a lot of the poses overlap tie into nsfw concepts, they also affect sfw posing. There's a reason they [only chose certain yoga poses](https://old.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1d6t0gc/sd3_release_on_june_12/l6uzx6n/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=StableDiffusion&utm_content=t1_l6x720p) or gymnastics poses to train on that look decent in SD3..\n\nI have trained 20,000 images in Onetrainer ripped from a porn site over realistic vision and pyros nsfw checkpoint (which had a great sdxl base to train on and sdxl based models to merge in before training.) I have also done those same 20,000 in realistic vision.\n\nThe trained-over pyro checkpoint I have looks better than any nsfw checkpoint on civitai, it even does sfw better with poses. The realistic vision one has nightmare limbs and I would be embarrassed to ever release it.\n\nTldr; the base models concepts, and even similar poses to the concept you are trying to train on being present in the base model is extremely important. My ray of hope though is the MMDiT weights and T5 encoder with SD3 2b. Can't wait to experiment with it.\n\nEdit: From StabilityAI paper directly: Latent Space Alignment: Models with pre-existing knowledge of related concepts have a more suitable latent space, making it easier for fine-tuning to enhance specific attributes without extensive retraining. If a model has already seen a variety of human poses, even if they are not exactly the ones you need, it can adapt to new, similar poses more effectively than a model with no related prior knowledge​ (Stability AI)​​ (Encord AI Platform)​. Source https://stability.ai/news/stable-diffusion-3-research-paper\n\n**Edit2:** I just gave Chatgpt 4o 20 popular AI research papers to read since I'm getting a ton of downvotes, including Sora related ones, Nvidia AYS, Perturbed Guidance, StoryDiffusion, an image is worth 16x16 paper, and a bunch of others. Then I had it analyze my post to compare and make sure what I am saying is accurate. Here is what it said:\n\n>The Reddit user's post highlights some important points about training AI models, particularly in the context of Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3) and NSFW (Not Safe for Work) content. Here's an analysis of the key points and their validity:  \n>  \n>Key Points from the Reddit Post:  \n>  \n>Base Model Significance:  \n>  \n>Claim: The base model's existing concepts and similar poses are crucial when training new concepts, including NSFW content.  \n>  \n>Validation: This is a valid point. The pre-existing knowledge in the base model can significantly influence the effectiveness and quality of the fine-tuning process. Models trained on datasets with diverse and relevant examples are better at generalizing and producing coherent outputs when new, related concepts are introduced.  \n>  \n>Pose Overlap:  \n>  \n>Claim: Similar poses in the base model help in training specific concepts, such as certain yoga or gymnastics poses that overlap with NSFW content.  \n>  \n>Validation: This is also true. Transfer learning relies on the similarity between the new and old data. If the base model already understands certain poses, it can more effectively adapt to new but related poses or concepts, making training more efficient and effective.  \n>  \n>Training Data Quality and Quantity:  \n>  \n>Claim: Using a large and relevant dataset (20,000 images) from specific sources yields better results than using mismatched data (e.g., NSFW data on a model not well-suited for it).  \n>  \n>Validation: The quality and relevance of the training data are crucial. Using high-quality, contextually relevant data ensures that the model learns the intended concepts accurately. Poorly matched data can lead to issues like \"nightmare limbs\" and other artifacts, as described by the user.  \n>  \n>Onetrainer and NSFW Models:  \n>  \n>Claim: Training using Onetrainer with a well-matched NSFW checkpoint (e.g., Pyro's NSFW checkpoint) yields better results than using generic or mismatched models.  \n>  \n>Validation: Tools like Onetrainer, which are designed for stable diffusion model training, can indeed facilitate better training outcomes by providing the right infrastructure and features for fine-tuning models. A well-suited checkpoint as a starting point can significantly enhance the training quality.  \n>  \n>Anticipation for Future Models:  \n>  \n>Claim: Future models and technologies (e.g., MMDiT weights and T5 encoder with SD3 2b) hold promise for improved training and results.  \n>  \n>Validation: Advances in model architectures and training techniques continually improve the performance and capabilities of AI models. Incorporating new technologies can provide better results and open up new possibilities for fine-tuning and customizing models.  \n>  \n>Potential Points of Inexperience or Misunderstanding:  \n>  \n>Expectation Management:  \n>  \n>Training AI models, especially for complex and nuanced tasks like generating NSFW content, is inherently challenging and requires a deep understanding of the underlying principles. While the user’s results are promising, the expectation that similar results can always be achieved with minimal effort might not hold true for everyone, especially those with less experience or different datasets.  \n>  \n>Community Feedback:  \n>  \n>The downvotes and negative feedback on the Reddit post might stem from the community’s skepticism or differing experiences. It's important to consider that results can vary significantly based on numerous factors, including the quality of the data, the specific use case, and the technical expertise of the person training the model.  \n>  \n>Conclusion:  \n>  \n>The user’s findings are largely valid and supported by established principles in machine learning and transfer learning. The importance of a well-suited base model, relevant training data, and appropriate tools like Onetrainer cannot be overstated. However, results can vary, and managing expectations is crucial. The community's mixed reactions may reflect differing experiences and the inherent challenges in training sophisticated AI models.\n\n**EDIT 2: It did have some good news though**:\n\n>Impact on Training NSFW Concepts:  \n>  \n>The integration of MMDiT and T5 encoder in SD3 can potentially mitigate some challenges associated with training models on specific concepts, such as NSFW content, even if the base model lacks these concepts. Here's how these components help:  \n>  \n>**Improved Text Understanding**: The T5 encoder enhances the model's ability to understand and process detailed textual descriptions, which is crucial for generating specific concepts accurately.  \n>  \n>**Enhanced Multimodal Interaction**: MMDiT facilitates better interaction between text and image modalities, improving the model's ability to generate coherent and contextually accurate images based on the provided prompts.  \n>  \n>**Flexibility in Training**: The versatile architecture of MMDiT allows for efficient training and adaptation to new concepts, potentially reducing the dependency on the base model's pre-existing knowledge.  \n>  \n>Practical Considerations:  \n>  \n>**Training Data Quality**: High-quality, well-tagged training data is still essential for achieving good results. Even with advanced architectures like MMDiT and T5, the model's performance will heavily depend on the quality of the training dataset.  \n>  \n>**Hyperparameter Tuning**: Proper tuning of hyperparameters is crucial to avoid issues like overfitting, especially when working with smaller datasets.  \n>  \n>By leveraging the advanced capabilities of MMDiT and the T5 encoder, SD3 aims to offer more robust and flexible training options, which can help in training specific concepts, including NSFW content, more effectively.\n\n## Comment ID l711eab with +12 score by [(Gyramuur, Reddit, 2024-06-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1d7li52/correcting_some_misinformation_about_being_able/l711eab/) (in reply to ID 1d7li52):\nYou really gonna say you've trained a NSFW checkpoint that you claim is better than any other NSFW checkpoint and not drop the link? rofl\n\n### Comment ID l711wat with +3 score by [(campingtroll, Reddit, 2024-06-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1d7li52/correcting_some_misinformation_about_being_able/l711wat/) (in reply to ID l711eab):\nit has a ton of watermarks from the website on nearly ever image lol, I have to crop everything and retrain.

Even though I’ve read people say the exact opposite thing regarding SDXL being censored compared to 1.5?\n\nCould it not be that your training on the SDXL mode simply went better because it’s a better architecture and you trained on top of a model that already had relevant training on top of the base model?

SDXL is good enough base for nsfw, I've trained on Cascade and it is not. I updated my post, It's not really an argument but just a fact of how it works currently with SDXL and SD 1.5 curently.\n\nI think there is a bare minimum amount of concepts it has to have or it starts to become more and more difficult. It's a spectrum, not a black and white \"just train these images and it's in the model just like this other model that has even less yoga and gymnastics. It's the same thing!\"\n\nThe base model concepts have a huge impact. For example, If you theoretically had a model that was heavily trained towards woman talking really close to microphones in most of that base model, guess what that base model concept is more likely to turn into if you start training nsfw over it?\n\nThat reminds me, for my science research I'm still needing to test \"a woman talking really close to a microphone, side view\" in SD3 to make sure that wasn't cut out purposely and they have pervert brains over there like me, it's possible they trained only images where the mics or elongated objects are super far away from a person's face.\n\n## Comment ID l70i7eb with +1 score by [(HardenMuhPants, Reddit, 2024-06-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1d7li52/correcting_some_misinformation_about_being_able/l70i7eb/) (in reply to ID 1d7li52):\nBest way is a large data set and batch size while crossing your fingers.\n\n\nSolution for SD3 could be to over train a NSFW Lora and merge it into base to get the ball rolling on a fine-tune."

This is in contrast to certain startups which have a very simple, narrow product with a handful of customers. Such breadth means that the work is diverse, engaging and meaningful. I get to work on a lot of new interesting parts of the product and interface with a wide range of customers. Combining this pipeline of work with a high autonomy environment means that you're expected to get stuck in and pull your weight. On my fourth day at the company I was independently conversing with and shipping code to one of our customers. When I asked my manager whether I was ok to send something out, the response was 'I trust you, if you think it's good to go send it'. Finally, the people in the company make it a very pleasant place to work. Everyone is smart, helpful and kind which makes my days extremely enjoyable. So far it seems as if the structure is genuinely flat.",

Combining this pipeline of work with a high autonomy environment means that you're expected to get stuck in and pull your weight. On my fourth day at the company I was independently conversing with and shipping code to one of our customers. When I asked my manager whether I was ok to send something out, the response was 'I trust you, if you think it's good to go send it'. Finally, the people in the company make it a very pleasant place to work. Everyone is smart, helpful and kind which makes my days extremely enjoyable.

      "# [Training, Validation, Test Split for Machine Learning Datasets by Nikolaj Buhl on 2023-06-13](https://encord.com/blog/train-val-test-split/)\nProperly splitting your machine learning datasets into training, validation, and test sets is essential for building robust and accurate models. This guide explores the differences between these sets, highlights three effective splitting methods, identifies common mistakes to avoid, and explains how to use Encord for managing dataset splits in computer vision projects.\n\nThe train-validation-test split is fundamental to the development of robust and reliable machine learning models.\n\nPut very simply:\n\nThe goal: Create a neural network that generalizes well to new data\n\nThe motto: Never train that model on test data\n\nThe premise is intuitive – avoid employing the same dataset to train your machine learning model that you use to evaluate it. Doing so will result in a biased model that reports an artificially high model accuracy against the dataset it was trained on and poor model accuracy against any other dataset.\n\nTo ensure the generalizability of your machine learning algorithm, it is crucial to split the dataset into three segments: the training set, validation set, and test set. This will allow you to realistically measure your model’s performance by ensuring that the dataset used to train the model and the dataset used to evaluate it are distinct.\n\nIn this article, we outline:\n\nTraining Set vs. Validation Set vs. Test Sets\n\n3 Methods to Split Machine Learning Datasets\n\n3 Mistakes to Avoid When Splitting Machine Learning Datasets\n\nHow to use Encord for Training, Validation, and Test Splits in Computer Vision\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nCreate and validate your dataset with Encord platform\n\nLearn more\n\nTraining vs. Validation vs. Test Sets\n\nBefore we dive into the best practices of the train-validation-test split for machine learning models, let’s define the three sets of data.\n\nTraining Set\n\nThe training set is the portion of the dataset reserved to fit the model. In other words, the model sees and learns from the data in the training set to directly improve its parameters.\n\nTo maximize model performance, the training set must be (i) large enough to yield meaningful results (but not too large that the model overfits) and (ii) representative of the dataset as a whole. This will allow the trained model to predict any unseen data that may appear in the future.\n\nOverfitting occurs when a machine learning model is too specialized and adapted to the training data that it is unable to generalize and make correct predictions on new data. As a result, an overfit model will overperform with the training set but underperform when presented with validation sets and test sets.\n\nValidation Set\n\nThe validation set is the set of data used to evaluate and fine-tune a machine learning model during training, helping to assess the model’s performance and make adjustments.\n\nBy evaluating a trained model on the validation set, we gain insights into its ability to generalize to unseen data. This assessment helps identify potential issues such as overfitting, which can have a significant impact on the model’s performance in real-world scenarios.\n\nThe validation set is also essential for hyperparameter tuning. Hyperparameters are settings that control the behavior of the model, such as learning rate or regularization strength. By experimenting with different hyperparameter values, training the model on the training set, and evaluating its performance with the validation set, we can identify the optimal combination of hyperparameters that yields the best results. This iterative process fine-tunes the model and maximizes its performance.\n\nTest Set\n\nThe test set is the set of data used to evaluate the final performance of a trained model.\n\nIt serves as an unbiased measure of how well the model generalizes to unseen data, assessing its generalization capabilities in real-world scenarios. By keeping the test set separate throughout the development process, we obtain a reliable benchmark of the model’s performance.\n\nThe test dataset also helps gauge the trained model's ability to handle new data. Since it represents unseen data that the model has never encountered before, evaluating the model fit on the test set provides an unbiased metric into its practical applicability. This assessment enables us to determine if the trained model has successfully learned relevant patterns and can make accurate predictions beyond the training and validation contexts.\n\n3 Methods to Split Machine Learning Datasets\n\nThere are various methods of splitting datasets for machine learning models. The right approach for data splitting and the optimal split ratio both depend on several factors, including the use case, amount of data, quality of data, and the number of hyperparameters.\n\nRandom Sampling\n\nThe most common approach for dividing a dataset is random sampling. As the name suggests, the method involves shuffling the dataset and randomly assigning samples to training, validation, or test sets according to predetermined ratios. With class-balanced datasets, random sampling ensures the split is unbiased.\n\nWhile random sampling is the best approach for many ML problems, it is not the correct approach with imbalanced datasets. When the data consists of skewed class proportions, random sampling will almost certainly create a bias in the model.\n\nStratified Dataset Splitting\n\nStratified dataset splitting is a method commonly used with imbalanced datasets, where certain classes or categories have significantly fewer instances than others. In such cases, it is crucial to ensure that the training, validation, and test sets adequately represent the class distribution to avoid bias in the final model.\n\nIn stratified splitting, the dataset is divided while preserving the relative proportions of each class across the splits. As a result, the training, validation, and test sets contain a representative subset from each class, maintaining the original class distribution. By doing so, the model can learn to recognize patterns and make predictions for all classes, resulting in a more robust and reliable machine learning algorithm.\n\nCross-Validation Splitting\n\nCross-validation sampling is a technique used to split a dataset into training and validation sets for cross-validation purposes. It involves creating multiple subsets of the data, each serving as a training set or validation set during different iterations of the cross-validation process.\n\nK-fold cross-validation and stratified k-fold cross-validation are common techniques. By utilizing these cross-validation sampling techniques, researchers and machine learning practitioners can obtain more reliable and unbiased performance metrics for their machine learning models, enabling them to make better-informed decisions during model development and selection.\n\n3 Mistakes to Avoid When Data Splitting\n\nThere are some common pitfalls that data scientists and ML engineers make when splitting datasets for model training.\n\nInadequate Sample Size\n\nInsufficient sample size in the training, validation, or test sets can lead to unreliable model performance metrics. If the training set is too small, the model may not capture enough patterns or generalize well. Similarly, if the validation set or test set is too small, the performance evaluation may lack statistical significance.\n\nData Leakage\n\nData leakage occurs when information from the validation set or test set inadvertently leaks into the training set. This can lead to overly optimistic performance metrics and an inflated sense of the final model accuracy. To prevent data leakage, it is crucial to ensure strict separation between the training set, validation set, and test set, making sure that no information from the evaluation sets are used during model training.\n\nImproper Shuffle or Sorting\n\nIncorrectly shuffling or sorting the data before splitting can introduce bias and affect the generalization of the final model. For example, if the dataset is not shuffled randomly before splitting into training set and validation set, it may introduce biases or patterns that the model can exploit during training. As a result, the trained model may overfit to those specific patterns and fail to generalize well to new, unseen data.\n\nHow to use Encord for Training, Validation, and Test Splits\n\nTo get started with a machine learning project, Encord’s platform can be used for data splitting.

Remember to choose the same features but filter by different values to avoid data leakage.\n\nTraining, Validation, and Test Set: Key Takeaways\n\nHere are the key takeaways:\n\nIn order to create a model that generalizes well to new data, it is important to split data into training, validation, and test sets to prevent evaluating the model on the same data used to train it.\n\nThe training set data must be large enough to capture variability in the data but not so large that the model overfits the training data.\n\nThe optimal split ratio depends on various factors. The rough standard for train-validation-test splits is 60-80% training data, 10-20% validation data, and 10-20% test data.\n\nRecommended Articles",

According to a McKinsey report, AI-powered automation could boost global productivity by up to 1.4% annually, with sectors like manufacturing, healthcare, and logistics seeing the most significant transformation. However, integrating AI into robotics requires overcoming challenges related to data limitations and ethical concerns. Also, the lack of diverse datasets for domain-specific environments makes it difficult to train effective AI models for robotic applications. In this post, we will explore how AI is transforming robotic automation, its applications, challenges, and future potential. We will also see how Encord can help address issues in developing scalable AI-based robotic systems. Difference between AI and Robotics Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics are different yet interconnected fields within engineering and technology. Robotics focuses on designing and building machines capable of performing physical tasks, while AI enables these machines to perceive, learn, and make intelligent decisions. AI consists of algorithms that enable machines to analyze data, recognize patterns, and make decisions without explicit programming. It uses techniques like natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) to allow machines to perform complex tasks. For instance, AI powers everyday technologies, such as Google's search algorithms, re-ranking systems, and conversational chatbots like Gemini and ChatGPT by OpenAI. Robotics, however, focuses on designing, building, and operating programmable physical systems that can work independently or with minimal human assistance. These systems use sensors to gather information and may follow programmed instructions to move, pick up objects, or communicate. A line following robot The integration of AI with robotic systems helps them perceive their environment, plan actions, and control their physical components to achieve specific objectives, such as navigation, object manipulation, or autonomous decision-making. Why is AI Important for Robotics? AI-powered robotic systems can learn from data, recognize patterns, and make intelligent decisions without requiring repetitive programming. Here are some key benefits of using AI in robotics: Enhanced Autonomy and Decision-Making Traditional robots use rule-based programs that limit their flexibility and adaptability. AI-driven robots analyze their environment, assess different scenarios, and make real-time decisions without human intervention. Improved Perception and Interaction AI improves a robot's ability to perceive and interact with its surroundings. NLP, CV, and sensor fusion enable robots to recognize objects, speech, and human emotions. For example, AI-powered service robots in healthcare can identify patients, understand spoken instructions, and detect emotions through facial expressions and tone of voice. Learning and Adaptation AI-based robotic systems can learn from experience using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) technologies. They can analyze real-time data, identify patterns, and refine their actions over time. Faster Data Processing The modern robotic system relies on sensors such as cameras, LiDAR, radar, and motion detectors to perceive their surroundings. Processing such diverse data types simultaneously is cumbersome. However, experts can use AI to speed up data processing and enable the robot to make real-time decisions. Predictive Maintenance AI improves robotic reliability by detecting wear and tear and predicting potential failures to prevent unexpected breakdowns. This is important in high-demand environments like the manufacturing industry, where downtime can be costly. How is AI Used in Robotics? While the discussion above highlights the benefits of AI in robotics, it does not yet clarify how robotic systems use AI algorithms to operate and execute complex tasks. The most common types of AI robots include: AI-Driven Mobile Robots An AI-based mobile robot (AMR) navigates environments intelligently, using advanced sensors and algorithms to operate efficiently and safely. It can: See and understand its surroundings using sensors like cameras, LiDAR, and radar, combined with CV algorithms to detect objects, recognize obstacles, and interpret their environment. Process and analyze data in real time to map out their surroundings, predict potential hazards, and adjust to changes as they move. Find the best path and navigate efficiently using AI-driven algorithms to plan routes, avoid obstacles, and move smoothly in dynamic spaces. Interact naturally with humans using AI-powered speech recognition, gesture detection, and other intuitive interfaces to collaborate safely and effectively. Mobile robots in a warehouse AMRs are highly valuable on the factory floor to improve workflow efficiency and productivity. For example, in warehouse inventory management, an AMR can intelligently navigate through aisles, dynamically adjust its route to avoid obstacles and congestion, and autonomously transport goods. Articulated Robotic Systems Articulated robotic systems (ARS), or robotic arms, are widely used in industrial settings for tasks like assembly, welding, painting, and material handling. They assist humans with heavy lifting and repetitive work to improve efficiency and safety. Articulated robot Modern ARS uses AI to process sensor data, enabling real-time perception, decision-making, and precise task execution. AI algorithms help ARS interpret their operating environment, dynamically adjust movements, and optimize performance for specific applications like assembly lines or warehouse automation. Collaborative Robots Collaborative robots, or cobots, work safely alongside humans in shared workspaces. Unlike traditional robots that operate in isolated environments, cobots use AI-powered perception, ML, and real-time decision-making to adapt to dynamic human interactions. AI-driven computer vision helps cobots detect human movements, recognize objects, and adjust their actions accordingly. ML algorithms enable them to improve task execution over time by learning from human inputs and environmental feedback. NLP and gesture recognition allow cobots to understand commands and collaborate more intuitively with human workers. Cobots: Universal Robots (UR) Universal Robots' UR Series is a good example of a cobot used in manufacturing. These cobots help with tasks like assembly, packaging, and quality inspection. They work alongside factory workers to improve efficiency and human-robot collaboration. AI-Powered Humanoid Robots AI-based humanoid robots replicate the human form, cognitive abilities, and behaviors. They integrate AI to perform completely autonomous tasks or collaborate with humans. These robotic systems combine mechanical structures with AI technologies like CV and NLP to interact with humans and provide assistance. Sophia at UN For example, Sophia is one of the most well-known AI-powered humanoid robots, developed by Hanson Robotics. Sophia engages with humans using advanced AI, facial recognition, and NLP. She can hold conversations, express emotions, and even learn from interactions. Learn about vision-based articulated robots with six degrees of freedom AI Models Powering Robotics Development AI is transforming the robotics industry, allowing organizations to build large-scale autonomous systems to handle complex tasks more independently and efficiently. Key advancements driving such transformation include DL models for perception, reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks for adaptability, motion planning for control, and multimodal architectures for processing different types of information. Let’s discuss these in more detail: Deep Learning for Perception DL processes images, text, speech, or time-series data from robotic sensors to analyze complex information and identify patterns. DL algorithms, like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can analyze image and video data to understand its content. In contrast, Transformer and recurrent neural network (RNN) models process sequential data like speech and text. A sample CNN architecture for image recognition For instance, AI-based CV models play a crucial role in robotic perception, enabling real-time object recognition, tracking, and scene understanding. Some commonly used models include: YOLO (You Only Look Once): A fast object detection model family that enables real-time localization and classification of multiple objects in a scene, making it ideal for robotic navigation and manipulation. SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping): A framework combining sensor data with AI-driven mapping techniques to help robots navigate unknown environments by building spatial maps while tracking their position. Semantic Segmentation Models: Assign class labels to every image pixel, enabling a robot to understand scene structure for tasks like autonomous driving and warehouse automation. Common examples include DeepLab and U-Net. DeepSort for Object Tracking: A tracking-by-detection model that tracks objects in real time by first detecting them and assigning a unique ID to each object. Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Behavior RL enables robots to learn through trial and error by interacting with their environment. The robot receives feedback in the form of rewards for successful actions and penalties for undesirable outcomes. Popular RL frameworks used in robotics include: Deep Q-Network (DQN): DQN uses DL to learn the Q-function. The technique allows agents to store their experiences in batches and use samples to train the neural network. Lifelong Federated Reinforcement Learning (LFRL): This architecture allows robots to continuously learn and adapt by sharing knowledge across a cloud-based system, enhancing navigation and task execution in dynamic environments. Q-learning: A model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that helps agents learn optimal policies through trial and error by updating Q-values based on rewards received from the environment. PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization): A reinforcement learning algorithm that balances exploration and exploitation by optimizing policies using a clipped objective function, ensuring stable and efficient learning. Multi-modal Models Multi-modal models combine data from sensors like cameras, LiDAR, microphones, and tactile sensors to enhance perception and decision-making. Integrating multiple sources of information helps robots develop a more comprehensive understanding of their environment. Examples of multimodal frameworks used in robotics include: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP): Helps robots understand visual and textual data together, enabling tasks like object recognition and natural language interaction. ImageBind: Aligns multiple modalities, including images, text, audio, and depth, allowing robots to perceive and reason about their surroundings holistically. Flamingo: A vision-language model that processes sequences of images and text, improving robotic perception in dynamic environments and enhancing human-robot communication. Challenges of Integrating AI in Robotics Advancements in AI are allowing robots to perceive their surroundings better, make real-time decisions, and interact with humans. However, integrating AI into robotic systems presents several challenges. Let’s briefly discuss each of them. Lack of Domain-specific Data: AI algorithms require a large amount of good quality data for training. However, acquiring domain-specific data is particularly challenging in specialized environments with unique constraints. For instance, data collection for surgical robots requires accessing diverse real-world medical data, which is difficult due to ethical concerns. Processing Diverse Data Formats: A robotic system often depends on various sensors that generate heterogeneous data types such as images, signals, video, audio, text, and other modalities. Combining these sensors' information into a cohesive AI system is complex. It requires advanced sensor fusion and processing techniques for accurate prediction and decision-making. Data Annotation Complexity: High-quality multimodal datasets require precise labeling across different data types (images, LiDAR, audio). Manual annotation is time-consuming and expensive, while automated methods often struggle with accuracy. Learn how to use Encord Active to enhance data quality using end-to-end data preprocessing techniques. How Encord Ensures High-Quality Data for Training AI Algorithms for Robotics Applications The discussion above highlights that developing reliable robotic systems requires extensive AI training to ensure optimal performance. However, effective AI training relies on high-quality data tailored to specific robotic applications. Managing the vast volume and variety of data presents a significant challenge, necessitating the use of end-to-end data curation tools like Encord to streamline data annotation, organization, and quality control for more efficient AI model development for robotics.

Future of Robotics & AI AI and robotics together are driving transformative changes across various industries. Here are some key areas where these technologies are making a significant impact: Edge and Cloud Computing Edge computing offers real-time data processing within robotic hardware, which is important for low-latency use cases such as autonomous navigation. Cloud computing provides vast data storage and powerful processors to process large amounts of data for AI model training. This allows robots to react quickly to their immediate surroundings and learn from large data sets. Smart Factories AI-powered robots are transforming factories, which use automation, IoT, and AI-driven decision-making to optimize manufacturing, streamline workflows, and enhance the supply chain. Unlike traditional factories that rely on fixed processes and human efforts, smart factories use interconnected machines, sensors, and real-time analytics to adapt to production needs dynamically. These systems enable predictive maintenance, optimization, and autonomous quality control. For example, Ocado’s robotic warehouse uses swarm intelligence to coordinate thousands of small robots for high-speed order fulfillment. Swarm Robotics Swarm robotics uses a group of robots to solve a complex task collaboratively. AI makes these swarms coordinate their movements, adapt to changing environments, and perform tasks like search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and agricultural automation. SwarmFarm Robotics spraying pesticides For example, SwarmFarm Robotics in Australia uses autonomous robots in precision agriculture. These robots work together to monitor crop health, spray pesticides, and plant seeds. Coordinating their actions allows them to cover large areas quickly and adapt to different field conditions.

A Guide to AI in Robotics\n\nConsider a boxy robot nicknamed “Shakey” developed by Stanford Research Institute (SRI) in the 1960s. This robot was named “Shakey” for its trembling movements. It was the first robot that could perceive its surroundings and decide how to act on its own​. Shakey Robot (Source) It could navigate hallways and figure out how to go around obstacles without human help. This machine was more than a curiosity. It was an early example of giving artificial intelligence a physical body. The development of Shakey marked a turning point as artificial intelligence (AI) was no longer confined to a computer, it was acting in the real world. The concept of Embodied AI began to gain momentum in the 1990s, inspired by Rodney Brooks's 1991 paper, \"Intelligence without representation.\" In this work, Brooks challenged traditional AI approaches by proposing that intelligence can emerge from a robot's direct engagement with its environment, rather than relying on complex internal models. This marked a significant shift from earlier AI paradigms, which predominantly emphasized symbolic reasoning. Over the years, progress in machine learning, particularly in deep learning and reinforcement learning, has enabled robots to learn through trial and error to enhance their capabilities. Today, Embodied AI is evident in a wide range of applications, from industrial automation to self-driving cars, reshaping the way we interact with and perceive technology. Embodied AI is an AI inside a physical form. In simple terms, it is AI built into a tangible system (like a robot or self-driving car) that can sense and interact with its environment​. A modern day example of embodied AI in a humanoid form is Phoenix, a general-purpose humanoid robot developed by Sanctuary AI. Like Shakey, Phoenix is designed to interact with the physical world and make its own decisions. Phoenix benefits from decades of advances in sensors, actuators, and artificial intelligence. Phoenix - Machines that Work and Think Like People (Source) What is Embodied AI? Embodied AI is about creating AI systems that are not just computational but are part of physical robots. These robots can sense, act, and learn from their surroundings, much like humans do through touch, sight, and movement. What is Embodied AI? (Source) The idea comes from the \"embodiment hypothesis,\" introduced by Linda Smith in 2005. This hypothesis says that thinking and learning are influenced by constant interactions between the body and the environment. It connects to earlier ideas from philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty, who wrote about how perception is central to understanding and how the body plays a key role in shaping that understanding. In practice, Embodied AI brings together areas like computer vision, environment modeling, and reinforcement learning to build systems that get better at tasks through experience. A good example is robotic vacuum cleaners Roomba. Roomba uses sensors to navigate its physical environment, detect obstacles, and learn the layout of a room and adjust its cleaning strategy based on the data it collects. This allows it to perform actions (cleaning) directly within its surroundings, which is a key characteristic of embodied AI. Roomba Robot (Source) How Physical Embodiment Enhances AI Giving AI a physical body, like a robot, can improve its ability to learn and solve problems. The main benefit is that an embodied AI can learn by trying things out in the real world, not just from preloaded data. For example, think about learning to walk. A computer simulation can try to figure out walking in theory, but a robot with legs will actually wobble, take steps, fall, and try again which enables it to learn a bit more each time. This is just like a child learning to walk by falling and getting back up, the robot improves its balance and movement through real-world experience. Physical feedback, like falling or staying upright, teaches the AI what works and what does not work. This kind of hands-on learning is only possible when the AI has a body to act with. Real-world interaction also makes AI more adaptable. When an AI can sense its surroundings, it isn’t limited to what it was programmed to expect, rather it can handle surprises and adjust. For example, a household robot learning to cook might drop a tomato, feel the mistake through touch sensors, and learn to grip more gently next time. If the kitchen layout changes, the robot can explore and update its understanding. Embodied AI also combines multiple senses, called multimodal learning, to better understand its environment. For example, a robot might use vision to see an object and touch to feel it, creating a richer understanding. A robotic arm assembling something doesn’t just rely on camera images, it also feels the resistance and weight of parts as it works. This combination of senses helps the AI develop an intuitive grasp of physical tasks. Even simple devices, like robotic vacuum cleaners, show the power of embodiment. They learn the layout of a room by bumping into walls and furniture, improving their cleaning path over time. This ability to learn through real-world interaction by using sight, sound, touch, and movement gives embodied AI a practical understanding that software-only AI can not achieve. It is the difference between knowing something in theory and truly understanding it through experience. Applications of Embodied AI Embodied AI has several applications across various industries and domains. Here are a few key applications of Embodied AI. Autonomous Warehouse Robots Warehouse robots are a popular application of embodied AI. These robots transform how goods are stored, sorted, and shipped in modern logistics and supply chain operations. These robots are designed to automate repetitive, time-consuming, and physically demanding tasks to improve efficiency, accuracy, and safety in warehouses. For example, Amazon uses robots (e.g. Digit) in its fulfillment centers to streamline the order-picking and packaging process. These robots are the example of embodied AI because they learn and operate through direct interaction with their physical environment. Embodied AI Robot Digit (Source) Digit relies on sensors, cameras, and actuators to perceive and interact with its surroundings. For example, Digit uses its legs and arms to move and manipulate objects. This physical interaction generates real-time feedback that allow the robots to learn from their actions such as adjusting its grip on an item or navigating around obstacles. The robots improve their performance through repeated practice. For example, Digit learns to walk and balance by experiencing different surfaces and adjusting its movements accordingly. Inspection Robots Spot robot from Boston Dynamics is designed for a variety of inspection and service tasks. Spot is a mobile robot and is adaptable to different environments such as office, home, and outdoors such as construction sites, remote industrial facilities etc. With its four legs, Spot can navigate uneven terrain, stairs, and confined spaces that wheeled robots may struggle with. This makes it ideal for inspection tasks in challenging environments. Spot is equipped with camera, depth sensors, and microphone to gather environmental data. This allows it to perform tasks like detect structural damages, monitor environmental conditions, and even record high-definition video for remote diagnostics. While Spot can be operated remotely, it also has autonomous capabilities. It can patrol pre-defined routes, identify anomalies, and alert human operators in real time. Spot can learn from experience and adjust its behavior based on the environment. Spot Robot (Source) Autonomous Vehicles (Self-Driving Cars) Self-driving cars, developed by companies like Waymo, Tesla, and Cruise, use embodied AI for decision-making and actuation systems to navigate complex road networks without human intervention. These vehicles use a combination of cameras, radar, and LiDAR to create detailed, real-time maps of their surroundings. AI algorithms process sensor data to detect pedestrians, other vehicles, and obstacles and allow the car to make quick decisions such as braking, accelerating, or changing lanes. Self-driving cars often communicate with cloud-based systems and other vehicles to update maps and learn from shared driving experiences which improve safety and efficiency over time. Vehicles uses Embodied AI from Wayve AI (Source) Service Robots in Hospitality and Retail Embodied AI is transforming the hospitality and retail industries by revolutionizing customer interaction. Robots like Pepper are automating service tasks and enhancing guest experiences. Robots like this serve as both information kiosks and interactive assistants. For example, the Pepper robot uses computer vision and NLP to understand and interact with customers. It can detect faces, interpret gestures, and process spoken language which allow it to provide personalized greetings and answer common questions. Paper is equipped with sensors such as depth cameras and LIDAR to navigate through complex indoor environments. In retail settings, it can lead customers to products or offer store information. In hotels, similar robots might be tasked with delivering room service or even handling luggage by autonomously moving through corridors and elevators. These service robots learn from interactions. For example, it may adjust its speech and gestures based on customer demographics or feedback. Pepper robot from SoftBank (Source) Humanoid Robots Figure 2 is a humanoid robot developed by Figure.ai that gives AI a tangible, interactive presence. Figure 2 integrates advanced sensory inputs, real-time processing, and physical actuation which enable it to interact naturally with its surroundings and humans. Its locomotion capabilities are supported by real-time feedback from sensors, such as cameras and inertial measurement units, enabling it for smooth and adaptive movement across different surfaces and around obstacles. The robot uses integrated computer vision systems to recognize and interpret its surroundings. Figure 2 uses NLP and emotion recognition to engage in conversational interactions. Figure can learn from experience and refine its responses and behavior based on accumulated data from its operating environment which make it efficient to act in a real-world environment to complete designated tasks. Figure 2 Robot (Source) Difference Between Embodied AI and Robotics Robotics is the field of engineering and science focused on designing, building, and operating robots which are physical machines that can perform tasks automatically or with minimal human help. These robots are used in areas like manufacturing, exploration, entertainment etc. The field includes the hardware, control systems, and programming needed to create and run these machines. Embodied AI, on the other hand, refers to AI systems built into physical robots, allowing them to sense, learn from, and interact with their environment through their physical form. Inspired by how humans and animals learn through sensory and physical experiences, Embodied AI focuses on the robot's ability to adapt and improve its behavior using techniques like machine learning and reinforcement learning. For example, a robotic arm in a car manufacturing plant is programmed to weld specific parts in a fixed sequence. It uses sensors for precision but does not learn or adapt its welding technique over time. This is an example of robotics, relying on traditional control systems without the learning aspect of Embodied AI. On the other hand, ATLAS from Boston Dynamics learns to walk, run, and perform tasks by interacting with its environment and improving its skills through experience. This demonstrates Embodied AI, as the robot's AI system adapts based on physical feedback. Robotics vs Embodied AI (Source: FANUC, Boston Dynamics) Future of Embodied AI The future of Embodied AI depends on advancement of exciting trends and technologies that will make robots smarter and more adaptable. The Embodied AI is set to change both our industries and everyday lives. As Embodied AI relies on machine learning, sensors, and robotics hardware, the stage is set for future growth. Following are key emerging trends and technological advancement that make this happen. Emerging Trends Advanced Machine Learning: Robots will use generative AI and reinforcement learning to master complex tasks quickly and adapt to different situations. For example, a robot could learn to assemble furniture by watching videos and practicing, handling various designs with ease. Soft Robotics: Robots made from flexible materials will improve safety and adaptability, especially in healthcare. Think of a soft robotic arm helping elderly patients, adjusting its grip based on touch. Multi-Agent Systems: Robots will work together in teams, sharing skills and knowledge. For instance, drones could collaborate to survey a forest fire, learning the best routes and coordinating in real-time. Human-Robot Interaction (HRI): Robots will become more intuitive, using natural language and physical cues to interact with people. Service robots, like SoftBank’s Pepper, could evolve to predict and meet customer needs in places like stores Technological Advances Improved Sensors: Improvement in LIDAR, tactile sensors, and computer vision will help robots understand their surroundings more accurately. For example, a robot could notice a spill on the floor and clean it up on its own. Energy-Efficient Hardware: New processors and batteries will make robots last longer and move more freely, which is important for tasks like disaster relief or space missions. Simulation and Digital Twins: Robots will practice tasks in virtual environments before doing them in the real world. Neuromorphic Computing: Human Brain inspired chips could help robots process sensory data more like humans, making robots like Boston Dynamics’ Atlas even more agile and responsive. Data Requirements for Embodied AI The ability of Embodied AI to learn from and adapt to environments depends on the data on which it is trained. Therefore the data play an important role in building Embodied AI. Following are the data requirements for Embodied AI. Large-Scale, Diverse Datasets Embodied AI systems need a large amount of data about different environments and sources to learn effectively. This diversity helps the AI understand a wide range of real-world scenarios, from different lighting and weather conditions to various obstacles and environments. Real-Time Data Processing and Sensor Integration Embodied AI systems use sensors like cameras, LIDAR, and microphones to see, hear, and feel their surroundings. Processing this data quickly is crucial. Therefore the real-time data processing solution (e.g., GPUs, neuromorphic chips) is required to allow the AI to make immediate decisions, such as avoiding obstacles or adjusting its actions as the environment changes. Data Labeling Data labeling is a process to give meaning to raw data (e.g., “this is a door,” “this is an obstacle”). It is used to guide supervised learning models to recognize patterns correctly. Poor labeling leads to errors, like a robot misidentifying a pet as trash. Data labeling is a tedious job, data labeling tools with AI assisted labeling is needed for such tasks.

Instead of training robots in isolation for specific tasks, DeepMind introduced two specialized models: Gemini Robotics: a vision-language-action (VLA) model built on Gemini 2.0. It accepts physical actions as a new output modality for directly controlling robots. Gemini Robotics-ER: a version of Gemini that incorporates embodied reasoning (ER) and spatial understanding. It allows roboticists to run their own programs along with Gemini’s spatial reasoning capabilities. This is monumental because Google demonstrates how you can take a multimodal artificial intelligence model, fine-tune it and apply it for robotics. Since it is multimodal, the robotic systems learn to generalize better rather than being proficient at a particular task without needing massive amounts of data to add a new ability. In this blog we will go through the key findings of the Gemini Robotics, the architecture, training pipeline and discuss the new capabilities it unlocks. Why Traditional Robotics Struggle? Training robots has always been an expensive and complex task. Most of the robots are trained with supervised datasets, reinforcement learning or imitation learning, but each approach has significant limitations. Supervised learning: needs massive annotated datasets. This makes scaling difficult. Reinforcement learning (RL): It has only been proven effective in controlled environments. It still needs millions of trial and error interactions and still fails to generalize to the real-world applications. Imitation learning (IL): It is efficient but it needs large scale expert demonstrations. It can be difficult to find demonstrations for each and every scenario. These challenges lead to narrowly specialized models that work well in training environments but break down in real-world settings. A warehouse robot trained to move predefined objects might struggle if an unexpected item appears. A navigation system trained in simulated environments might fail in new locations with different lighting, obstacles, or floor textures. Hence, the core issue of traditional robots is the lack of true generalization. However, DeepMind’s Gemini Robotics presents a solution to this problem by rethinking how robots are trained and how they interact with their environments. What Makes Gemini Robotics Different? Gemini Robotics is a general-purpose model capable of solving dexterous tasks in different environments and supports different robot embodiments. It uses Gemini 2.0 as a foundation and extends the multimodal capabilities to not only understand tasks through vision and language but also to act autonomously in the physical world. The integration of physical actions as a new output modality, alongside vision and language processing, allow the model to control robots directly. It helps the robots to adapt and perform complex tasks with minimal human interventions. Source Architecture Overview Gemini Robotics is built around an advanced vision-language-action model (VLA), where vision and language inputs are integrated with robotic control outputs. The core idea behind this is to help the model to perceive its environment, understand natural language instructions and act in the real-world task by controlling the robot’s actions. It is a transformer based architecture. The key components include: Vision Encoder: This module processes visual inputs from cameras or sensors, extracting spatial and object-related information. The encoder is capable of recognizing objects, detecting their positions, and understanding environmental contexts in dynamic settings. Language Encoder: The language model interprets natural language instructions. It converts user commands into an internal representation that can be translated into actions by the robot. The strength of Gemini Robotics lies in its ability to comprehend ambiguous language, contextual nuances, and even tasks with incomplete information. Action Decoder: The action decoder translates the multimodal understanding of the environment into actionable robotic movements. These include tasks like navigation, object manipulation, and interaction with external tools. Training Pipeline The training of these models is also unique as it combines multiple data sources and tasks to ensure that the model is good at generalizing across different settings. Data Collection The training process begins with collecting a diverse range of data from robotic simulations and real-world environments. This data includes both visual data such as images, videos, depth maps, and sensor data, and linguistic data such as task descriptions, commands, and natural language instructions. To create a robust dataset, DeepMind uses a combination of both synthetic data from controlled environments and real-world data captured from real robots performing tasks. Pretraining The model is first pretrained on multimodal datasets, where it learns to associate vision and language patterns with tasks. This phase is designed to give the model an understanding of fundamental object recognition, navigation, and task execution in various contexts. Pretraining helps the model learn generalizable representations of tasks without having to start from scratch for each new environment. Fine-tuning on Robotic Tasks After pretraining, the model undergoes fine-tuning using real-world robotic data to improve its task-specific capabilities. Here, the model is exposed to a wide range of tasks from simple object manipulation to complex multi-step actions in dynamic environments. Fine-tuning is done using a combination of supervised learning for task labeling and reinforcement learning for optimizing robotic behaviors through trial and error. Reinforcement Learning for Real-World Adaptation A key component of the Gemini Robotics pipeline is the use of reinforcement learning (RL), especially in the fine-tuning stage. Through RL, the robot learns by performing actions and receiving feedback based on the success or failure of the task. This allows the model to improve over time and develop an efficient policy for action selection. RL also helps the robot generalize its learned actions to different real-world environments. Embodied Reasoning and Continuous Learning The model is also designed for embodied reasoning, which allows it to adjust its actions based on ongoing environmental feedback. This means that Gemini Robotics is not limited to a static training phase but is capable of learning from new experiences as it interacts with its environment. This continuous learning process is crucial for ensuring that the robot remains adaptable, capable of refining its understanding and improving its behavior after deployment. Gemini Robotics-ER Building on the capabilities of Gemini Robotics, this model introduces embodied reasoning (ER). What is Embodied Reasoning? Embodied reasoning refers to the ability of the model to understand and plan based on the physical space it occupies. Unlike traditional models that react to sensory input or follow pre-programmed actions, Gemini Robotics-ER has a built-in capability to understand spatial relationships and reason about movement. Source This enables the robot to assess its environment more holistically, allowing for smarter decisions about how it should approach tasks like navigation, object manipulation, or avoidance of obstacles. For example, a robot with embodied reasoning wouldn’t just move toward an object based on visual recognition. Instead, it would take into account factors like: Spatial context: Is the object within reach, or is there an obstacle blocking the way? Task context: Does the object need to be lifted, moved to another location, or simply avoided? Environmental context: What other objects are nearby, and how do they affect the task at hand? Source Gemini 2.0’s Embodied Reasoning Capabilities The Gemini 2.0 model already provided embodied reasoning capabilities which are further improved in the Gemini Robotics-ER model. It needs no additional robot-specific data or training as well. Some of the capabilities include: Object Detection: It can perform open-world 2D object detection, and generate accurate bounding boxes for objects based on explicit and implicit queries. Pointing: The model can point to objects, object parts, and spatial concepts like where to grasp or place items based on natural language descriptions. Trajectory Prediction: Using its pointing capabilities, Gemini 2.0 predicts 2D motion trajectories grounded in physical observations, enabling the robot to plan movement. Grasp Prediction: Gemini Robotics-ER extends this by predicting top-down grasps for objects, enhancing interaction with the environment. Multi-View Correspondence: Gemini 2.0 processes stereo images to understand 3D scenes and predict 2D point correspondences across multiple views. Example of 2D trajectory prediction. Source How Gemini Robotics-ER Works? Gemini Robotics-ER incorporates several key innovations in its architecture to facilitate embodied reasoning. Spatial mapping and modeling This helps the robot to build and continuously update a 3D model of its surroundings. This spatial model allows the system to track both static and dynamic objects, as well as the robot's own position within the environment. Multimodal fusion It combines vision sensors, depth cameras, and possibly other sensors (e.g., LiDAR). Spatial reasoning algorithms These algorithms help the model predict interactions with environmental elements. Gemini Robotics-ER’s task planner integrates spatial understanding, allowing it to plan actions based on real-world complexities. Unlike traditional models, which follow predefined actions, Gemini Robotics-ER can plan ahead for tasks like navigating crowded areas, manipulating objects, or managing task sequences (e.g., stacking objects). ERQA (Embodied Reasoning Quality Assurance) It is an open-source benchmark to evaluate embodied reasoning capabilities of multimodal models. In the fine-tuned Gemini models it acts as a feedback loop which evaluates the quality and accuracy of spatial reasoning, decision-making, and action execution in real-time. ERQA Question categories. Source The core of ERQA is its ability to evaluate whether the robot's actions are aligned with its planned sequence and expected outcomes based on the environment’s current state. In practice, ERQA ensures that the robot: Accurately interprets spatial relationships between objects and obstacles in its environment. Adapts to real-time changes in the environment, such as moving obstacles or shifts in spatial layout. Executes complex actions like object manipulation or navigation without violating physical constraints or failing to complete tasks. The system generates feedback signals that inform the model about the success or failure of its decisions. These signals are used for real-time correction, ensuring that errors in spatial understanding or action execution are swiftly addressed and corrected. Why Do These Models Matter for Robotics? One of the biggest breakthroughs in Gemini Robotics is its ability to unify perception, reasoning, and control into a single AI system. Instead of relying solely on robotic experience, Gemini leverages vast external knowledge from videos, images, and text, enabling robots to make more informed decisions. For example, if a household robot encounters a new appliance it has never seen before, a traditional model would likely fail unless it had been explicitly trained on that device. In contrast, Gemini can infer the appliance's function based on prior knowledge from images and instructional text it encountered during pretraining. This ability to extrapolate and reason about unseen scenarios is what makes multimodal AI so powerful for robotics. Through this approach, DeepMind is laying the foundation for more intelligent and adaptable humanoid robots capable of operating across a wide range of industries from warehouse automation to household assistance and beyond. Conclusion In short, Google introduces models and benchmarks and shows how robots can do more and adapt more to different situations. By being general, interactive, and dexterous, it can handle a variety of tasks, respond quickly to changes, and perform actions with precision, much like humans. 📘 Download our newest e-book, The rise of intelligent machines to learn more about implementing physical AI models.\n\nMar 20 2025\n\n5 M\n\nWhat is Physical AI?\n\nImagine a world where in the morning the sun rises over busy cities not just with human activity but also with the intelligent machines moving around.

Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS): RTOS manages hardware resources and ensures real-time execution of tasks. This is very important in Physical AI systems which require precise timing. Can AI Have a Physical Form? When most people imagine AI, they think of it as some application, computer programs, or invisible systems like Netflix suggesting a show, Siri answering questions, or chatbots like ChatGPT answering queries. This kind of AI lives entirely in the digital world and works behind the scenes like a ghost that thinks and calculates but it can not move around us and touch and interact with the physical world. In this application, the ai is a software system, like a brain without a body. Physical AI flips this idea. Instead of being trapped in a computer's memory, the Physical AI gets a body, for example, a robot, self-driving car, or smart machine. Imagine a robot that does not only figure out how to pick up a cup but actually reaches for it, grabs it, and hands it to you. Physical AI connects thinking (algorithms) to real-world action. To do this, it needs: Eyes and ears through sensors (cameras, microphones, radar) to see and hear. A brain which are the processors to understand what is happening. Arms and legs through motors, wheels, or grippers so that it can move and interact. SenseRobot: AI-Powered Smart Chess Coach and Companion (Source) Just take an example of a self-driving car, which does not only think about driving but uses cameras to spot stop signs, calculates when to brake, and actually physically presses the brake pedal. Similarly, a warehouse robot that may use AI to find a package, navigate around people, and lift it with mechanical arms. MARS rover uses AI to identify organic materials in the search for life on Mars (Source) Why does this matter? Because traditional AI is like a smart assistant on your phone, it can talk or answer queries, but it can not do anything physical. On the other hand, Physical AI can act. It can build things, clean your house, assist surgeons, or even explore Mars. By giving AI a body, we’re turning it from a tool that thinks into a partner that acts. This will change the way we live, work, and solve problems in the real world. So, we can say that a traditional AI is the brain that thinks, talks, and calculates. Whereas, Physical AI is the brain and the body that thinks, sees, moves, interacts and is possible indeed. Physical AI vs. Embodied AI Although Physical AI and Embodied AI seem similar at a glance. They are quite different. Let's understand the difference between the two. The Physical AI systems are integrated with physical hardware (sensors, actuators, robots etc.) to interact with the real world. The main focus in Physical AI is to execute tasks in physical environments. It combines AI algorithms with mechanical systems and can perform operations such as movement, grasping, navigation. This type of AI relies on hardware (motors, cameras, wheels) to interact with surroundings. An example of Physical AI are self-driving cars that use AI to process sensor data (cameras, radar) and physically control steering, brake, or acceleration. Another example is warehouse robots like Amazon’s Sparrow that use AI to identify, grab, and sort packages. Embodied AI systems on the other hand are designed to learn and reason through physical interaction with their environment. They focus on intelligence that comes from having a body. The emphasis in Embodied AI is on intelligence that comes from a body’s experiences similar to humans who learn by touching, moving, and interacting. The goal of Embodied AI is to learn skills (e.g., walking, grasping) through trial and error in the real world. Framework of Embodied Agent (Source) An example of Embodied AI is Atlas Robot from Boston Dynamics that learns to balance, jump, or navigate uneven terrain by adapting its body movements. We can summarize the difference between the Physical AI is the AI with a body that acts to solve practical problems (e.g., factory automation) and Embodied AI is the AI that needs a body to learn to improve intelligence (e.g., teaching robots common sense through interaction). The Promise of Physical AI The promise of Physical AI lies in its ability to bring digital intelligence into the tangible physical world. Physical AI is revolutionizing the way machines work alongside humans and transform different industries. Following are key sectors where Physical AI is set to make a huge impact. Healthcare There are many applications of Physical AI in healthcare. For example, surgical robots use AI-guided systems to perform minimally invasive surgeries with precision. Wearable robots such as rehabilitation exoskeletons help patients regain mobility by adapting to their movements in real time. AI powered autonomous robots deliver supplies, sanitize rooms, or assist nurses with repetitive tasks. Exoskeleton control neural network (Source) Manufacturing In manufacturing, collaborative robots (Cobots) are the AI-powered arms that work alongside humans. Cobots learn to handle delicate tasks like assembling electronics or doing more complex tasks that require precision similar to human hands. Techman AI Cobot (Source) Agriculture In agriculture, AI-driven machines plant, water, and harvest crops while analyzing soil health. Weeding robots use computer vision to identify and remove weeds without chemicals and autonomous tractors drive themselves, avoid obstacles using computer vision and other sensor data and perform various farm tasks, from mowing to spraying. These autonomous tractors use sensors, GPS, and artificial intelligence (AI) to operate without a human in the cab. Driverless tractors perform fully autonomous spraying tasks at a Texas vineyard (Source) Logistics & Retail In Logistics & Retail, Physical AI power robots that sort, pack, and deliver goods with speed and accuracy. These robots use real-time decision-making with adaptive learning to handle a variety of products. For example, Proteus robots sort, pack, and move goods autonomously. Other machines like drones or delivery robots (e.g., Starship) navigate to deliver packages. Amazon Proteus Robot (Source) Construction Physical AI has an important role to play in transforming how humans do construction. AI-driven excavators, bulldozers, and cranes operate autonomously or semi-autonomously to perform tasks like digging, leveling, and material placement. Companies like Caterpillar and Komatsu are leveraging AI to create smarter heavy machinery. AI-powered robotic arms can perform repetitive tasks like bricklaying, welding, and concrete finishing with high precision. Komatsu Autonomous Haulage System (AHS) (Source) Physical AI is redefining industries by turning intelligent algorithms into real-world action. From hospitals to highways, its ability to act in the physical world will create robots and machines that are not just tools, but partners in solving humanity’s greatest challenges. Data and Hardware Challenges in Physical AI The data and hardware challenges in Physical AI revolve around deploying and executing AI models within hardware systems, such as industrial robots, smart devices, or autonomous machinery. This creates some unique challenges related to data and hardware as discussed below. Data Challenges Availability of High Quality Data As with the many other AI systems, this is also an issue with Physical AI. Physical AI systems often require large, precise datasets to train models for tasks like defect detection and path planning etc. These datasets must reflect the exact physical conditions (e.g., lighting, material properties) of the deployment environment. For example, a welding robot needs thousands of labeled images of welds of different metals under various factory conditions and images taken from different angles to train a vision system. Such data is often not available and collecting it manually is costly and time-consuming. Data Annotation and Labeling Complexity Physical AI systems require accurately annotated data on a variety of data samples for training which require domain expertise and manual labeling effort. Since the AI must act in real physical condition it must be trained on all possible types of conditions the system may face. For example, training a Physical AI system to detect weld imperfections requires engineers to annotate thousands of sensor readings or images in which labeling error by humans may be possible. Adapting to New Situations Physical AI systems are trained on fixed datasets that don’t evolve post-deployment. It may be possible that physical settings (such as change in the environment, place or equipment) in which Physical AI is deployed may change which makes it hard for pre-trained models to work. For example, a robotic arm trained to assemble a specific car model might struggle if the factory switches to a new design. In such cases the model becomes obsolete and requires retraining with fresh data. Hardware Challenges Computational Power and Energy Constraints Running AI models such as deep learning for computer vision on physical hardware requires significant computational resources. Such types of AI models often exceed the capabilities of embedded systems. Battery-powered devices (e.g., IoT sensors) or small robots may also face energy limits and industrial systems need robust cooling. For example, a FANUC welding robot may use a GPU to process sensor data, but integrating this into a compact, energy-efficient unit is costly and generates heat. This may result in hardware failure in a hot environment in the factory. Sensor Limitations and Reliability Physical AI depends on sensors (e.g., cameras, LIDAR, force sensors) to perceive the environment. Sometimes these sensors may not give precise reading or fail under harsh conditions (e.g., dust, vibration). Calibrating these sensors repeatedly can also degrade its performance. For example, a camera on a robotic arm may misjudge weld alignment in poor lighting or if dust obscures the lens which leads to defective outputs. Integration with Legacy Hardware Many physical systems such as factory robots or HVAC units need modern AI models running on outdated processors or proprietary interfaces. Deploying such AI models into these systems is technically challenging and expensive. For example, upgrading a 1990s-era manufacturing robot to use AI for defect detection may require replacing its control unit which may disrupt the production lines. Latency and Real-Time Processing Needs Physical tasks such as robotic welding or autonomous navigation require real-time decision making that must happen in precise milliseconds but AI inference on resource-constrained hardware introduces latency issues. If the AI model is migrated to the cloud, the delays may occur due to network issues. For example, a welding robot adjusting its path in the middle of the welding process might lag if its AI model runs on a slow CPU which results in uneven welds. AI Alignment Considerations The AI alignment problem refers to the challenge of ensuring that AI systems act in ways that are aligned with human values, goals, and ethical principles. This problem becomes especially critical as AI systems become more capable and autonomous. The misaligned AI could potentially cause harm, either unintentionally or due to conflict in objectives. In the context of Physical AI the alignment problem takes on additional layers of complexity as AI systems interact with the physical world. Following are the key alignment problems related to physical AI. Real-World Impact Physical AI systems have direct impact in the physical world. Misalignment in these systems can lead to physical harm, property damage, or environmental disruption. For example, a misaligned autonomous vehicle might prioritize efficiency over safety but it may sometimes lead to accidents. Therefore, ensuring that physical AI systems understand and respect human intentions in real-world environments is a significant challenge. Unpredictable Environments Physical AI operates in environments that are often unpredictable and complex. This makes it harder to train such AI models in all possible scenarios. This increases the risk of unintended behavior. For example, a household robot may misinterpret a human’s command in a way that leads to dangerous actions, such as mishandling objects or entering restricted areas. Ethical and Social Considerations Physical AI systems often operate in shared spaces with humans which can raise ethical questions about privacy, consent, and fairness. Misalignment could lead to violations of these principles. For example, a surveillance robot may overstep boundaries in monitoring public spaces which can lead to privacy concerns especially in areas like international boundaries between two countries. The AI alignment problem in Physical AI is not just about getting the AI algorithms right but it's also about integrating intelligence into machines that interact safely and beneficially with the physical world. Encord's Role in Advancing Physical AI Encord plays an important role in advancing Physical AI by enabling developers with the tools needed to efficiently manage and annotate multimodal data for training models. Accurately annotated data is essential for training intelligent systems that interact with the physical world. In Physical AI, robots and autonomous systems rely on a variety of data streams in the form of high-resolution images and videos to sensor readings like LiDAR and infrared to understand their environments and make decisions. Encord platform enables the process of annotating and curating this heterogeneous data and ensures that the AI models are trained on rich, accurate datasets that capture the complexities of real-world environments. For example, consider the customer story of Four Growers. Four Growers is a robotics and AI company that creates autonomous harvesting and analytics robots for agriculture, starting in commercial greenhouses. Four Growers uses multimodal annotation capabilities of Encord to label vast amounts of agricultural imagery and sensor data collected via drones and field sensors. This annotated data is then used to train models that power robots capable of precise crop monitoring and yield prediction. The integration of such diverse data types ensures that these AI systems can adapt to varying lighting conditions, detect changes in crop health, and navigate complex field terrains which are all critical for automating agricultural processes and optimizing resource management. Tomato Harvesting Robot by Four Growers (Source) The robot uses high-resolution images and advanced sensors to capture the detailed spatial data across the field. This information is used to create yield heatmaps that offer a granular view of crop performance. These maps show fruit count and yield variations across different parts of the field. When the robot is harvesting, its AI model helps in identifying and localizing tomatoes among the plant but also analysing its ripeness. By detecting the current ripeness and growth patterns, the system predicts how many tomatoes will be ripe in the coming weeks. Encord helps in the annotation and processing of multimodal data to train this kind of Physical AI system. Tomato Yield Forecasting (Source) Encord helps to accelerate the development of robust AI models for Physical AI by providing tools to prepare high-quality, multimodal training datasets.

It ensures a smooth movement of goods within warehouses, distribution centers, and manufacturing facilities. As businesses scale, optimizing internal logistics becomes critical for efficiency, cost reduction, and meeting consumer demands. With the rise of automation, robotics, and AI-driven logistics, companies are increasingly investing in intralogistics solutions to enhance productivity. But what exactly is intralogistics, and why should organizations care? What is Intralogistics? It is the flow of materials, goods, and data within a facility like warehouse, factory, or a fulfilment center. This also includes processes like storage, inventory management, material handling, and order fulfilment. Traditional logistics focus on external transport systems whereas interlogistics optimizes internal workflows using automation, robotics, and other AI powered systems. Businesses prioritize intralogistics to reduce operational costs, minimize errors, and improve supply chain agility. Components of Intralogistics Intralogistics have three core elements: Material Flow: The movement of goods within a facility, including receiving, storage, picking, packing, and shipping. Data Management: Using real-time data and analytics to provide visibility into inventory levels, order statuses, and equipment performance. Warehouse Management: Coordinating warehouse operations from inventory control to space optimization and labor allocation. Why Intralogistics Matters? Efficiency Gains: Streamlining operations improves order accuracy and reduces delays. Cost Reduction: Optimized workflows lower labor costs and minimize waste. Scalability: AI-driven intralogistics adapts to business growth and fluctuating demand. Sustainability: Efficient flow of goods reduces energy consumption and carbon footprint. Use Cases of Internal Logistics Warehouse Automation Warehouses use robots and conveyor belts to transport products faster with fewer mistakes. Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) and Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) transport goods, while robotic arms help with picking and packing. The conveyor belts and sortation systems ensure a smooth flow of inventory. AI warehouse management systems (WMS) track inventory in real-time, preventing stockouts and optimizing storage space. Source Manufacturing and Production Lines Factories use conveyor systems to move materials quickly between workstations. Conveyor systems move raw materials through different stages of production with minimal human intervention. Just-in-time (JIT) inventory systems are used to ensure the required parts arrive exactly when needed to avoid delays and also to reduce storage cost. Businesses also use AI models to forecast demands to help manufacturers keep an eye on the stock levels and avoid overstocking. E-commerce Fulfillment Centers Online retailers use automated storage and retrieval systems to speed up picking and packing. Automated storage and retrieval systems (AS/RS) organize inventory for fast picking and packing. AI-powered sortation systems classify and route packages efficiently, reducing delivery times. This helps businesses process more orders more efficiently with fewer errors. Cold Chain Logistics for Pharmaceuticals Temperature-sensitive goods, like vaccines and perishable medicines, require precise handling. Internal logistics processes, such as IoT-enabled storage systems, monitor temperature and humidity levels in real-time to ensure compliance with regulatory standards. Automated material handling reduces human error and ensures fast, safe transportation of critical healthcare supplies. Source Retail and Grocery Distribution Retailers use automated warehouses to restock shelves quickly. AI helps predict demand, so stores don’t overstock or run out of items. Challenges in Scaling Intralogistics Scaling logistical flow internally comes with several challenges, from handling massive amounts of real-time data to integrating automation into legacy systems Data Data is at the core of intralogistics. Warehouses, fulfillment centers, and manufacturing plants rely on a huge network of sensors, automation tools, and analytics to optimize product flow. However, managing and processing this data at scale presents several issues: Real Time Tracking and Visibility Accurate tracking of inventory, equipment, and shipments is critical for efficient intralogistics. But ensuring real-time visibility is difficult due to: Signal Interference: RFID and GPS-based tracking systems often face disruptions in large warehouses, affecting location accuracy. Data Latency: Delays in updating inventory counts or shipment status can lead to errors in order fulfillment. Scalability Issues: As operations expand, managing a growing network of connected sensors and devices becomes complex. Data-centric AI can clean and standardize tracking data, improving accuracy by filtering out inconsistencies and detecting anomalies in real time. Integrating Diverse Data Sources Intralogistics systems heavily depend on various sensors like RFID scanners, weight sensors, LiDAR, and camera. Each system also interact and rely on data from other systems as well. Hence, integrating and analysing data from these diverse sources presents challenges: Inconsistent Data Formats: Different vendors use different data structures, making it difficult to merge information. Conflicting Readings: One sensor may detect an object, while another fails to register it, leading to errors in automation. Processing Bottlenecks: High volumes of sensor data require powerful computing resources to ensure operational efficiency. Sensor fusion techniques can align, filter, and cross-validate information, ensuring accurate and consistent data for robotic systems and warehouse automation. Data Analytics and Decision Making Handling a large amount of data generated also lead to many challenges: Extracting Insights from Raw Data: AI models require well-structured, high-quality datasets for effective decision-making. Managing Unstructured Data: Video feeds, IoT logs, and sensor data need to be converted into actionable insights. Security and Compliance Risks: Protecting sensitive logistics data from cyber threats while ensuring regulatory compliance adds complexity. Infrastructure Many companies operate with legacy warehouse management software (WMS) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) software which are not designed for automation. Integrating new technology with existing infrastructure presents challenges such as: Compatibility Problems: Older systems may lack APIs or support for AI tools and robotic automation. Scalability Constraints: Expanding automation across multiple facilities requires a standardized approach, which is difficult when working with different vendors. Network Reliability: High-speed, stable connectivity is crucial for seamless machine-to-machine communication, yet many warehouses lack the necessary infrastructure. Specially designed adaptable softwares can be used as an intermediary layer, bridging data gaps between legacy systems and modern automation tools through intelligent API integrations and real-time processing. Cost and ROI Concerns for Automation While automation enhances efficiency, the high upfront investment in robotics, AI, and IoT devices raises concerns about the return of investment. The businesses need to consider the following: Implementation Costs: AI logistics solutions require significant initial investment in hardware, software, and training. Long Payback Periods: Efficiency gains take time to materialize, making it difficult to justify costs in the short term. Ongoing Maintenance Expenses: Automated systems require continuous updates and repairs, adding to operational costs. Still the businesses can leverage AI to optimize automation deployment by identifying high-impact areas for investment. This way businesses can achieve cost savings and efficiency improvements faster. Workforce Adaptation and Training As intralogistics systems become more automated, the role of human workers shifts from manual tasks to overseeing and maintaining the automation tools. However, you can face challenges in: Upskilling the Workforce: Traditional warehouse workers may lack experience in AI, robotics, and automation, requiring extensive training or hiring the right talent. Human-Machine Collaboration: Many intralogistics systems require workers to work alongside AI-driven robots, requiring new skills and training.

      "# [Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) & SA-V Dataset from Meta AI by Akruti Acharya on 2024-07-30](https://encord.com/blog/segment-anything-model-2-sam-2/)\nMeta AI has released Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2), a groundbreaking new foundation model designed for segmenting objects in both images and videos. Alongside SAM 2, Meta AI released new dataset SA-V Dataset, the large-scale dataset used to train SAM 2. To demonstrate these advancements, an interactive web demo has also been made available.\n\nThis release comes 14 months after the release of its predecessor, Segment Anything Model, which took the field of computer vision by storm. Learn how to finetune the first version of SAM.\n\nWhy SAM 2 is so exciting\n\nSAM 2 represents a significant leap forward in the field of computer vision. SAM 2 brings state-of-the-art segmentation and tracking capabilities for both video and images into a unified model. This unification eliminates the need for combining SAM with other video object segmentation models, streamlining the process of video segmentation into a single, efficient tool. It maintains a simple design and fast inference speed, making it accessible and efficient for users.\n\nThe AI model can track objects consistently across video frames in real-time, which opens up numerous possibilities for applications in video editing and mixed reality experiences. This new model builds upon the success of the original Segment Anything Model, offering improved performance and efficiency.\n\nSAM 2 can also be used to annotate visual data for training computer vision systems. It opens up creative ways to select and interact with objects in real-time or live videos.\n\nKey Features of SAM 2\n\nObject Selection and Adjustment: SAM 2 extends the prompt-based object segmentation abilities of SAM to also work for object tracks across video frames.\n\nRobust Segmentation of Unfamiliar Videos: The model is capable of zero-shot generalization. This means it can segment objects, images, and videos from domains not seen during training, allowing for versatility in real-world use cases.\n\nReal-Time Interactivity: SAM 2 utilizes a streaming memory architecture that processes video frames one at a time, allowing for real-time, interactive applications.\n\nSAM 2 Performance Enhancements\n\nSAM 2 sets new standards for object segmentation of both videos and images. During testing, it demonstrated superior accuracy in video segmentation with three times fewer interactions compared to previous models and an 8x speedup for video annotations. For image segmentation, it is not only more accurate but also six times faster than its predecessor, SAM.\n\nMeta AI emphasizes the broader implications of this release: \"We believe that our data, model, and insights will serve as a significant milestone for video segmentation and related perception tasks.\"\n\nMeta AI’s Segment Anything Model 2\n\nPromptable Visual Segmentation (PVS)\n\nPromptable Visual Segmentation (PVS) task extends the Segment Anything (SA) task from static images to videos, allowing interactive prompts such as clicks, bounding boxes, or masks on any frame to define or refine object segmentation. Upon receiving a prompt, the model immediately generates a segmentation mask for the specific frame and propagates this information to segment the object across the entire video, creating a spatio-temporal mask or masklet that includes segmentation for every frame. The model can also accommodate additional prompts for further refinement throughout the video.\n\nPrepare visual data for training and fine-tuning with Encord\n\nTry Encord today\n\nPVS emphasizes real-time, interactive segmentation with a focus on clearly defined objects, excluding regions without visual boundaries. It combines aspects of static image and video segmentation tasks, aiming to provide an enhanced user experience with minimal interaction. This task improves on traditional methods by allowing more flexible and immediate adjustments to segmentation through various prompt types, enabling accurate and efficient tracking of objects throughout video content.\n\nSAM 2 Model Architecture\n\nSAM 2 significantly advances the promptable capabilities of SAM by extending its functionality to the video domain. This extension incorporates a sophisticated per-session memory module, enabling the model to maintain and track selected objects across all frames of a video, even when these objects temporarily disappear from view. SAM 2 also supports dynamic corrections of mask predictions based on supplementary prompts throughout the video sequence.\n\nMeta AI’s Segment Anything Model 2\n\nIn contrast, SAM 1 lacks this memory mechanism and does not offer the same level of continuous tracking and dynamic correction for video sequences. SAM 1’s functionality is limited to static images without the advanced memory management capabilities introduced in SAM 2.\n\nHere are they key architectural innovations introduced in SAM 2:\n\nFrame Embeddings and Memory Conditioning\n\nUnlike SAM, where frame embeddings are directly obtained from an image encoder, SAM 2 employs a more intricate approach. In SAM 2, the frame embeddings are conditioned on both past predictions and frames that have been prompted. This conditioning allows the model to leverage historical context and anticipate future object movements. Notably, prompted frames can even be from the future relative to the current frame, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of object dynamics across the video.\n\nMemory Encoder and Memory Bank\n\nThe memory encoder in SAM 2 creates and manages frame memories based on current predictions, storing them in a memory bank. This bank operates as a FIFO (First-In, First-Out) queue, retaining information about up to N recent frames and M prompted frames. To capture short-term object motion, temporal position information is embedded into the memories of the N recent frames. However, this temporal information is not included in the memories of prompted frames due to their sparser training signal and the difficulty in generalizing to new temporal ranges not encountered during training. This design allows the model to refer to recent context and adjust predictions based on new information while managing the challenge of varying temporal contexts.\n\nImage Encoder\n\nFor efficient processing of videos, SAM 2 utilizes a streaming approach where the image encoder processes video frames sequentially. The encoder, based on a pre-trained masked autoencoder (MAE) Hiera, produces multi-scale feature embeddings for each frame. This hierarchical encoding facilitates the use of various scales during decoding, contributing to the model's ability to handle detailed segmentation tasks effectively.\n\nMemory Attention Mechanism\n\nSAM 2 incorporates a memory attention mechanism that conditions the current frame features on both past frame features and predictions, as well as any new prompts. This mechanism is implemented using a stack of L transformer blocks. The first block takes the image encoding of the current frame as input, performing self-attention and cross-attention with memories stored in the memory bank. This process helps integrate historical and contextual information into the current frame's feature representation.\n\nMask decoder architecture. SAM 2: Segment Anything in Images and Videos\n\nPrompt Encoder and Mask Decoder\n\nThe prompt encoder in SAM 2 mirrors the design of SAM's prompt encoder, capable of handling clicks (positive or negative), bounding boxes, or masks to define the object of interest. Sparse prompts are represented through positional encodings combined with learned embeddings for each prompt type. The mask decoder, while largely following SAM’s design, is enhanced to include high-resolution features from the image encoder, ensuring precise segmentation details. The decoder also predicts multiple masks to address potential ambiguities in video frames, selecting the most accurate mask based on predicted IoU (Intersection over Union).\n\nOcclusion Prediction\n\nSAM 2 introduces an occlusion prediction head that assesses whether the object of interest is visible in the current frame. This addition is crucial for handling scenarios where objects may be occluded or absent, allowing the model to indicate the visibility status alongside the segmentation masks.\n\nRead the full paper by written by Nikhila Ravi, Valentin Gabeur, Yuan-Ting Hu, Ronghang Hu, Chay Ryali, Tengyu Ma, Haitham Khedr, Roman Rädle, Chloe Rolland, Laura Gustafson, Eric Mintun, Junting Pan, Kalyan Vasudev Alwala, Nicolas Carion, Chao-Yuan Wu, Ross Girshick, Piotr Dollar, Christoph Feichtenhofer.\n\nTraining SAM 2\n\nPre-training: SAM 2 is pre-trained on the SA-1B dataset using an MAE pre-trained Hiera image encoder. It filters out masks covering over 90% of the image and trains with 64 randomly sampled masks per image. ℓ1 loss and sigmoid activation are used for IoU predictions. The model also applies horizontal flip augmentation and resizes images to 1024×1024 pixels.\n\nFull Training: Post pre-training, SAM 2 is trained on a mix of SA-V + Internal, SA-1B, and open-source AI video datasets like DAVIS, MOSE, and YouTubeVOS. It alternates between video and image data to optimize training. The model processes sequences of 8 frames, with up to 2 frames receiving corrective clicks. Initial prompts are sampled from ground-truth masks, positive clicks, or bounding boxes.\n\nLosses and Optimization: The model uses focal and dice losses for mask prediction, MAE loss for IoU, and cross-entropy loss for object presence. Only the mask with the lowest segmentation loss is supervised in multi-mask cases. An additional occlusion prediction head handles frames without valid masks.\n\nThis training strategy ensures SAM 2 effectively segments and tracks objects across video frames with interactive refinements.\n\nSA-V Dataset Overview\n\nExample of SA-V dataset with masklets overlaid. SAM 2: Segment Anything in Images and Videos\n\nSAM 2 was training on the SA-V dataset, which was open-sourced by Meta AI. SA-V includes approximately 600,000+ masklets collected from around 51,000 videos across 47 countries. Such numbers stand out as it’s >15x the number of videos and >50x the number of masks as compared to the previously largest open-source AI dataset (BURST and UVO-dense). This diverse dataset covers various real-world scenarios, providing comprehensive training data for robust model performance.\n\nPrimary data type: Video, mask annotations\n\nData function: Training, test\n\nVideos: 50.9K videos, with 54% indoor and 46% outdoor scenes. Average duration is 14 seconds, spanning diverse environments and capturing footage from 47 countries. Video resolutions range from 240p to 4K, with an average resolution of 1,401 × 1,037 pixels.\n\nMasklets: Total of 642.6K masklets, including 190.9K manually annotated and 451.7K automatic. This dataset offers approximately 53 times more masks than the largest existing VOS datasets. Automatic masklets are created using multi-tier grid prompting and post-processed for accuracy.\n\nAnnotation Details: Videos have an average length of 13.8 seconds and cover 4.2 million frames in total. Masklets are enhanced by removing tiny disconnected components and filling small holes.\n\nDataset Splits: Training, validation, and test sets are carefully curated to minimize overlap of similar objects. The validation set has 293 masklets across 155 videos, and the test set includes 278 masklets in 150 videos. Internal datasets add further training and testing data.\n\nLicense: CC BY 4.0 (Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International).\n\nAccess cost: Open\n\nData Collection: Videos were collected via a contracted third-party company.\n\nLabeling Methods: Masks generated by Meta Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) and human annotators.\n\nLabel Types: Masks are provided in COCO run-length encoding (RLE) format for the training set and in PNG format for validation and test sets.\n\nPerformance of SAM 2\n\nVideo Tasks\n\nInteractive Segmentation: SAM 2 excels in zero-shot video segmentation, outperforming previous methods like SAM+XMem++ and SAM+Cutie, and requires about three times fewer interactions.\n\nSemi-Supervised VOS: Outperforms XMem++ and Cutie across 17 datasets, showing strong performance with click, box, or mask prompts on the first frame.\n\nFairness: Shows minimal performance discrepancy across gender and age in the EgoExo4D dataset, with reduced variability in correctly segmented clips.\n\nSAM 2: Segment Anything in Images and Videos\n\nImage Tasks\n\nSegment Anything Task: Achieves higher accuracy (58.9 mIoU with 1 click) than SAM (58.1 mIoU) and is six times faster. Training on SA-1B and video data mix boosts accuracy to 61.4%.

SAM 2: Segment Anything in Images and Videos\n\nOverall, SAM 2 offers superior accuracy, efficiency, and speed in both video and image segmentation tasks.\n\nReal-World Applications of SAM 2\n\nSAM 2 is poised to revolutionize fields such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), robotics, autonomous vehicles, and video editing. These applications often require temporal localization beyond image-level segmentation, making SAM 2 an ideal solution.\n\nThe model can be integrated into larger systems to create novel experiences. Its video object segmentation outputs can be used as inputs for modern video generation models, enabling precise editing capabilities. SAM 2's extensibility allows for future enhancements with new types of input prompts, facilitating creative interactions in real-time or live video contexts.\n\nSAM 2: Related Work\n\nSegment Anything\n\nSegment Anything (SAM) introduced a promptable image segmentation framework allowing for zero-shot segmentation based on flexible prompts like bounding boxes or points. SAM's capabilities were extended with HQ-SAM for higher-quality outputs and EfficientSAM, MobileSAM, and FastSAM for improved efficiency. SAM's applications have spanned diverse fields, including medical imaging, remote sensing, motion segmentation, and camouflaged object detection.\n\nInteractive Video Object Segmentation (iVOS)\n\nInteractive video segmentation has advanced with methods focusing on user-guided annotations like clicks or scribbles. Early methods used graph-based optimizations, while more recent approaches have employed modular designs for mask propagation. The DAVIS interactive benchmark inspired similar interactive evaluation settings. Approaches integrating SAM with video trackers face challenges such as tracker limitations and re-annotation requirements.\n\nSemi-Supervised Video Object Segmentation (VOS)\n\nSemi-supervised VOS typically involves tracking objects throughout a video using an initial mask provided for the first frame. Early neural network-based methods adapted models with online fine-tuning or offline training. Recent advancements have introduced RNNs and cross-attention mechanisms or employed vision transformers. Although semi-supervised VOS is a specific instance of SAM's Promptable Visual Segmentation, the task of annotating high-quality masks remains challenging.\n\nData Engine for Creating Video Segmentation Datasets\n\nEarly VOS datasets such as DAVIS and YouTube-VOS provided high-quality annotations but were limited in scale for training deep learning models. Recent datasets have addressed this by increasing the difficulty of the VOS task, focusing on aspects like occlusions, long videos, extreme transformations, and object diversity. The SA-V dataset, developed using a multi-phase data engine, significantly expands annotation coverage to include both whole objects and parts, surpassing the scale and diversity of existing datasets. Notably, the iterative process increased labeling performance by 8x with the help of SAM 2.\n\nData Engine Phases:\n\nPhase 1: SAM Per Frame - In this initial phase, SAM was used for per-frame annotation with high spatial precision, but the process was slow (37.8 seconds per frame). This phase collected 16K masklets.\n\nPhase 2: SAM + SAM 2 Mask - This phase introduced SAM 2 for temporal mask propagation, improving speed (7.4 seconds per frame) while maintaining high quality. It collected 63.5K masklets.\n\nPhase 3: SAM 2 - The final phase utilized SAM 2’s full capabilities, achieving the highest speed (4.5 seconds per frame) and quality. It collected 197.0K masklets.\n\nQuality Verification and Auto Masklet Generation: A verification step was implemented to ensure high-quality annotations. Automatic masklets were also generated to enhance diversity and identify model limitations. Auto-generated masklets were reviewed and refined, contributing to the dataset’s extensive coverage.\n\nLimitations of SAM 2\n\nSegmenting Across Shot Changes: SAM 2 may struggle to maintain object segmentation across changes in video shots.\n\nCrowded Scenes: The model can lose track of or confuse objects in densely populated scenes.\n\nLong Occlusions: Prolonged occlusions can lead to errors or loss of object tracking.\n\nFine Details: Challenges arise with objects that have very thin or fine details, especially if they move quickly.\n\nInter-Object Communication: SAM 2 processes multiple objects separately without shared object-level contextual information.\n\nQuality Verification: The current reliance on human annotators for verifying masklet quality and correcting errors could be improved with automation.\n\nTry SAM 2\n\nSAM 2 is available under an Apache 2.0 license, allowing developers and researchers to install it on a GPU machine. Meta has also released the SA-V dataset, a web based demo, and the research paper, facilitating further innovation and development in computer vision systems for the AI community.

      "# [Eric Landau, Co-Founder & CEO of Encord – Interview Series by Antoine Tardif on 2024-09-10](https://www.unite.ai/eric-landau-co-founder-ceo-of-encord-interview-series/)\nEric Landau is the CEO & Co-Founder of Encord, an active learning platform for computer vision. Eric was the lead quantitative researcher on a global equity delta-one desk, putting thousands of models into production. Before Encord, he spent nearly a decade in high-frequency trading at DRW. He holds an S.M. in Applied Physics from Harvard University, M.S. in Electrical Engineering, and B.S. in Physics from Stanford University.\n\nIn his spare time, Eric enjoys playing with ChatGPT and large language models and craft cocktail making.\n\nWhat inspired you to co-found Encord, and how did your experience in particle physics and quantitative finance shape your approach to solving the “data problem” in AI?\n\nI first started thinking about machine learning while working in particle physics and dealing with very large datasets during my time at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). I was using software designed for physicists by physicists, which is to say there was a lot to be desired in terms of a pleasant user experience. With easier tools, I would have been able to run analyses much faster.\n\nLater, working in quantitative finance at DRW, I was responsible for creating thousands of models that were deployed into production. Similar to my experience in physics, I found that high-quality data was critical in making accurate models and that managing complex, large-scale data is difficult. Ulrik had a similar experience visualizing large image datasets for computer vision.\n\nWhen I heard about his initial idea for Encord, I was immediately on board and understood the importance. Together, Ulrik and I saw a huge opportunity to build a platform to automate and streamline the AI data development process, making it easier for teams to get the best data into models and build trustworthy AI systems.\n\nCan you elaborate on the vision behind Encord and how it compares to the early days of computing or the internet in terms of potential and challenges?\n\nEncord's vision is to be the foundational platform that enterprises rely on to transform their data into functional AI models. We are the layer between a company’s data and their AI.\n\nIn many ways, AI mirrors previous paradigm shifts like personal computing and the Internet in that it will become integral to workflows for every individual, business, nation, and industry. Unlike previous technological revolutions, which have been largely bottlenecked by Moore’s law of compounded computational growth of 30x every 10 years, AI development has benefited from simultaneous innovations. It is thus moving at a much faster pace. In the words of NVIDIA’s Jensen Huang: “For the very first time, we are seeing compounded exponentials…We are compounding at a million times every ten years. Not a hundred times, not a thousand times, a million times.” Without hyperbole, we are witnessing the fastest-moving technology in human history.\n\nThe potential here is vast: by automating and scaling the management of high-quality data for AI, we’re addressing a bottleneck preventing broader AI adoption. The challenges are reminiscent of early-day hurdles in previous technological eras: silos, lack of best practices, limitations for non-technical users, and a shortage of well-defined abstractions.\n\nEncord Index is positioned as a key tool for managing and curating AI data. How does it differentiate itself from other data management platforms currently available?\n\nThere are a few ways that Encord Index stands out:\n\nIndex is scalable: Allows users to manage billions, not millions, of data points. Other tools face scalability issues for unstructured data and are limited in consolidating all relevant data in an organization.\n\nIndex is flexible: Integrates directly with private data storage and cloud storage providers such as AWS, GCP, and Azure. Unlike other tools that are limited to a single cloud provider or internal storage system, Index is agnostic to where the data is located. It lets you manage data from many sources with appropriate governance and access controls that allow them to develop secure and compliant AI applications.\n\nIndex is multimodal: Supports multimodal AI, managing data in the form of images, videos, audio, text, documents and more. Index is not limited to a single form of data like many LLM tools today. Human cognition is multimodal, and we believe multimodal AI will be at the heart of the next wave of AI advancements, which will supplant chatbots and LLMs.\n\nIn what ways does Encord Index enhance the process of selecting the right data for AI models, and what impact does this have on model performance?\n\nEncord Index enhances data selection by automating the curation of large datasets, helping teams identify and retain only the most relevant data while removing uninformative or biased data. This process not only reduces the size of datasets but also significantly improves the quality of the data used for training AI models. Our customers have seen up to a 20% improvement in their models while achieving a 35% reduction in dataset size and saving hundreds of thousands of dollars in compute and human annotation costs.\n\nWith the rapid integration of cutting-edge technologies like Meta’s Segment Anything Model, how does Encord stay ahead in the fast-evolving AI landscape?\n\nWe intentionally built the platform to be able to adapt to new technologies quickly. We focus on providing a scalable, software-first approach that easily incorporates advancements like SAM, ensuring that our users are always equipped with the latest tools to stay competitive.\n\nWe plan to stay ahead by focusing on multimodal AI. The Encord platform can already manage complex data types such as images, videos, and text, so as more advancements in multimodal AI come our way, we’re ready.\n\nWhat are the most common challenges companies face when managing AI data, and how does Encord help address these?\n\nThere are 3 main challenges companies face:\n\nPoor data organization and controls: As enterprises prepare to implement AI solutions, they are often met with the reality of siloed and unorganized data that is not AI-ready. This data often lacks strong governance around it, limiting much of it from being used in AI systems.\n\nLack of human experts: As AI models tackle increasingly complex problems, there will soon be a shortage of human domain experts to prepare and validate data. As a company’s AI demands increase, scaling that human workforce is challenging and costly.\n\nUnscalable tooling: Performant AI models are very data-hungry in terms of data needed for fine-tuning, validation, RAG, and other workflows. The previous generation of tools is not equipped to manage the amount of data and types of data required for today’s production-grade models.\n\nEncord fixes these problems by automating the process of curating data at scale, making it easy to identify impactful data from problematic data and ensuring the creation of effective training and validation datasets. It uses a software-first approach that is easy to scale up or down as data management needs change. Our AI-assisted annotation tools empower human-in-the-loop domain experts to maximize workflow efficiency. This process is particularly crucial in industries such as financial services and healthcare, where AI trainers are costly. We make it easy to manage and understand all of an organization’s unstructured data, reducing the need for manual labor.\n\nHow does Encord tackle the issue of data bias and under-represented areas within datasets to ensure fair and balanced AI models?\n\nTackling data bias is a critical focus for us at Encord. Our platform automatically identifies and surfaces areas where data might be biased, allowing AI teams to address these issues before they impact model performance. We also ensure that under-represented areas within datasets are properly included, which helps in developing fairer and more balanced AI models. By using our curation tools, teams can be confident that their models are trained on diverse and representative data.\n\nEncord recently secured $30 million in Series B funding. How will this funding accelerate your product roadmap and expansion plans?\n\nThe $30 million in Series B funding will be used to drastically increase the size of our product, engineering, and AI research teams over the next six months and accelerate the development of Encord Index and other new features. We’re also expanding our presence in San Francisco with a new office, and this funding will help us scale our operations to support our growing customer base.\n\nAs the youngest AI company from Y Combinator to raise a Series B, what do you attribute to Encord's rapid growth and success?\n\nOne of the reasons we have been able to grow quickly is that we have adopted an extremely customer-centric focus in all areas of the company. We are constantly communicating with customers, listening closely to their problems, and “bear hugging” them to get to solutions. By hyper-focusing on customer needs rather than hype, we’ve created a platform that resonates with top AI teams across various industries. Our customers have been instrumental in getting us to where we are today. Our ability to scale quickly and effectively manage the complexity of AI data has made us an attractive solution for enterprises.\n\nWe also owe much of our success to our teammates, partners, and investors, who have all worked tirelessly to champion Encord. Working with world-class product, engineering, and go-to-market teams has been enormously impactful in our growth.\n\nGiven the increasing importance of data in AI, how do you see the role of AI data platforms like Encord evolving in the next five years?\n\nAs AI applications grow in complexity, the need for efficient and scalable data management solutions will only increase. I believe that every enterprise will eventually have an AI department, much like how IT departments exist today. Encord will be the only platform they need to manage the vast amounts of data required for AI and get models to production quickly.",
      "# [Human-in-the-Loop Machine Learning (HITL) Explained by Nikolaj Buhl on 2023-05-18](https://encord.com/blog/human-in-the-loop-ai/)\nHuman-in-the-Loop (HITL) is a transformative approach in AI development that combines human expertise with machine learning to create smarter, more accurate models. Whether you're training a computer vision system or optimizing machine learning workflows, this guide will show you how HITL improves outcomes, addresses challenges, and accelerates success in real-world applications.\n\nIn machine learning and computer vision training, Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) is a concept whereby humans play an interactive and iterative role in a model's development. To create and deploy most machine learning models, humans are needed to curate and annotate the data before it is fed back to the AI. The interaction is key for the model to learn and function successfully.\n\nHuman annotators, data scientists, and data operations teams always play a role. They collect, supply, and annotate the necessary data. However, how the amount of input differs depends on how involved human teams are in the training and development of a computer vision model.\n\nWhat Is Human in the Loop (HITL)?\n\nHuman-in-the-loop (HITL) is an iterative feedback process whereby a human (or team) interacts with an algorithmically-generated system, such as computer vision (CV), machine learning (ML), or artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nScale your annotation workflows and power your model performance with data-driven insights\n\nTry Encord today\n\nEvery time a human provides feedback, a computer vision model updates and adjusts its view of the world. The more collaborative and effective the feedback, the quicker a model updates, producing more accurate results from the datasets provided in the training process.\n\nIn the same way, a parent guides a child’s development, explaining that cats go “meow meow” and dogs go “woof woof” until a child understands the difference between a cat and a dog.\n\nHow Does Human-in-the-loop Work?\n\nHuman-in-the-loop aims to achieve what neither an algorithm nor a human can manage by themselves. Especially when training an algorithm, such as a computer vision model, it’s often helpful for human annotators or data scientists to provide feedback so the models gets a clearer understanding of what it’s being shown.\n\nIn most cases, human-in-the-loop processes can be deployed in either supervised or unsupervised learning.\n\nIn supervised learning, HITL model development, annotators or data scientists give a computer vision model labeled and annotated datasets.\n\nHITL inputs then allow the model to map new classifications for unlabeled data, filling in the gaps at a far greater volume with higher accuracy than a human team could. Human-in-the-loop improves the accuracy and outputs from this process, ensuring a computer vision model learns faster and more successfully than without human intervention.\n\nIn unsupervised learning, a computer vision model is given largely unlabeled datasets, forcing them to learn how to structure and label the images or videos accordingly. HITL inputs are usually more extensive, falling under a deep learning exercise category.\n\nActive Learning vs. Human-In-The-Loop\n\nActive learning and human-in-the-loop are similar in many ways, and both play an important role in training computer vision and other algorithmically-generated models. Yes, they are compatible, and you can use both approaches in the same project.\n\nHowever, the main difference is that the human-in-the-loop approach is broader, encompassing everything from active learning to labeling datasets and providing continuous feedback to the algorithmic model.\n\nHow Does HITL Improve Machine Learning Outcomes?\n\nThe overall aim of human-in-the-loop inputs and feedback is to improve machine-learning outcomes.\n\nWith continuous human feedback and inputs, the idea is to make a machine learning or computer vision model smarter. With constant human help, the model produces better results, improving accuracy and identifying objects in images or videos more confidently.\n\nIn time, a model is trained more effectively, producing the results that project leaders need, thanks to human-in-the-loop feedback. This way, ML algorithms are more effectively trained, tested, tuned, and validated.\n\nAre There Drawbacks to This Type of Workflow?\n\nAlthough there are many advantages to human-in-the-loop systems, there are drawbacks too.\n\nUsing HITL processes can be slow and cumbersome, while AI-based systems can make mistakes, and so can humans. You might find that a human error goes unnoticed and then unintentionally negatively impacts a model's performance and outputs. Humans can’t work as quickly as computer vision models.\n\nHence the need to bring machines onboard to annotate datasets. However, once you’ve got people more deeply involved in the training process for machine learning models, it can take more time than it would if humans weren’t as involved.\n\nExamples of Human-in-the-Loop AI Training\n\nOne example is in the medical field, with healthcare-based image and video datasets. A 2018 Stanford study found that AI models performed better with human-in-the-loop inputs and feedback compared to when an AI model worked unsupervised or when human data scientists worked on the same datasets without automated AI-based support.\n\nHumans and machines work better and produce better outcomes together. The medical sector is only one of many examples whereby human-in-the-loop ML models are used.\n\nWhen undergoing quality control and assurance checks for critical vehicle or airplane components, an automated, AI-based system is useful; however, for peace of mind, having human oversight is essential.\n\nHuman-in-the-loop inputs are valuable whenever datasets are rare and a model is being fed. Such as a dataset containing a rare language or artifacts. ML models may not have enough data to draw from; human inputs are invaluable for training algorithmically-generated models.\n\nA Human-in-the-Loop Platform for Computer Vision Models\n\nWith the right tools and platform, you can get a computer vision model to production faster.\n\nEncord is one such platform, a collaborative, active learning suite of solutions for computer vision that can also be used for human-in-the-loop (HITL) processes.\n\nWith AI-assisted labeling, model training, and diagnostics, you can use Encord to provide the perfect ready-to-use platform for a HITL team, making accelerating computer vision model training and development easier. Collaborative active learning is at the core of what makes human-in-the-loop (HITL) processes so effective when training computer vision models.

With greater computing power and state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning algorithms, AI is approaching a new era where large multimodal models dominate the AI landscape.\n\nReports suggest the multimodal AI market will grow by 35% annually to USD 4.5 billion by 2028 as the demand for analyzing extensive unstructured data increases. These models can comprehend multiple data modalities simultaneously and generate more accurate predictions than their traditional counterparts.\n\nIn this article, we will discuss what multimodal models are, how they work, the top models in 2024, current challenges, and future trends.\n\nWhat are Multimodal Models?\n\nMultimodal models are AI deep-learning models that simultaneously process different modalities, such as text, video, audio, and image, to generate outputs. Multimodal frameworks contain mechanisms to integrate multimodal data collected from multiple sources for more context-specific and comprehensive understanding.\n\nIn contrast, unimodal models use traditional machine learning (ML) algorithms to process a single data modality simultaneously. For instance, You Only Look Once (YOLO) is a popular object detection model that only understands visual data.\n\nUnimodal vs. Multimodal Framework\n\nWhile unimodal models are less complex than multimodal algorithms, multimodal systems offer greater accuracy and enhanced user experience. Due to these benefits, multimodal frameworks are helpful in multiple industrial domains.\n\nFor instance, manufacturers use autonomous mobile robots that process data from multiple sensors to localize objects. Moreover, healthcare professionals use multimodal models to diagnose diseases using medical images and patient history reports.\n\nHow Multimodal Models Work?\n\nAlthough multimodal models have varied architectures, most frameworks have a few standard components. A typical architecture includes an encoder, a fusion mechanism, and a decoder.\n\nArchitecture\n\nEncoders\n\nEncoders transform raw multimodal data into machine-readable feature vectors or embeddings that models use as input to understand the data’s content.\n\nEmbeddings\n\nMultimodal models often have three types of encoders for each data type - image, text, and audio.\n\nImage Encoders:Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a popular choice for an image encoder. CNNs can convert image pixels into feature vectors to help the model understand critical image properties.\n\nText Encoders: Text encoders transform text descriptions into embeddings that models can use for further processing. They often use transformer models like those in Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) frameworks.\n\nAudio Encoders: Audio encoders convert raw audio files into usable feature vectors that capture critical audio patterns, including rhythm, tone, and context. Wav2Vec2 is a popular choice for learning audio representations.\n\nFusion Mechanism Strategies\n\nOnce the encoders transform multiple modalities into embeddings, the next step is to combine them so the model can understand the broader context reflected in all data types. Developers can use various fusion strategies according to the use case.\n\nThe list below mentions key fusion strategies.\n\nEarly Fusion: Combines all modalities before passing them to the model for processing.\n\nIntermediate Fusion: Projects each modality onto a latent space and fuses the latent representations for further processing.\n\nLate Fusion: Processes all modalities in their raw form and fuses the output for each.\n\nHybrid Fusion: Combines early, intermediate, and late fusion strategies at different model processing phases.\n\nFusion Mechanism Methods\n\nWhile the list above mentions the high-level fusion strategies, developers can use multiple methods within each strategy to fuse the relevant modalities.\n\nAttention-based Methods\n\nAttention-based methods use the transformer architecture to convert embeddings from multiple modalities into a query-key-value structure. The technique emerged from a seminal paper - Attention is All You Need - published in 2017.\n\nResearchers initially employed the method for improving language models, as attention networks allowed these models to have longer context windows. However, developers now use attention-based methods in other domains, including computer vision (CV) and generative AI.\n\nAttention networks allow models to understand relationships between embeddings for context-aware processing. Cross-modal attention frameworks fuse different modalities in a multimodal context according to the inter-relationships between each data type.\n\nFor instance, an attention filter will allow the model to understand which parts of a text prompt relate to an image’s visual embeddings, leading to a more efficient fusion output.\n\nConcatenation\n\nConcatenation is a straightforward fusion technique that merges multiple embeddings into a single feature representation.\n\nFor instance, the method will concatenate a textual embedding with a visual feature vector to generate a consolidated multimodal feature.\n\nThe method helps in intermediate fusion strategies by combining the latent representations for each modality.\n\nDot-Product\n\nThe dot-product method involves element-wise multiplication of feature vectors from different modalities. It helps capture the interactions and correlations between modalities, assisting models to understand the commonalities among different data types.\n\nHowever, it only helps in cases where the feature vectors do not suffer from high dimensionality. Taking dot-products of high-dimensional vectors may require extensive computational power and result in features that only capture common patterns between modalities, disregarding critical nuances.\n\nDecoders\n\nThe last component is a decoder network that processes the feature vectors from different modalities to produce the required output.\n\nDecoders can contain cross-modal attention networks to focus on different parts of input data and produce relevant outputs. For instance, translation models often use cross-attention techniques to understand the meanings of sentences in different languages simultaneously.\n\nRecurrent neural network (RNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) frameworks are popular choices for constructing decoders to perform tasks involving sequential, visual, or generative processes.\n\nLearn how multimodal models work in our detailed guide on multimodal learning\n\nMultimodal Models - Use Cases\n\nWith recent advancements in multimodal models, AI systems can perform complex tasks involving the simultaneous integration and interpretation of multiple modalities.\n\nThe capabilities allow users to implement AI in large-scale environments with extensive and diverse data sources requiring robust processing pipelines.\n\nThe list below mentions a few of these tasks that multimodal models perform efficiently.\n\nVisual Question-Answering (VQA): VQA involves a model answering user queries regarding visual content.

      "# [Top 10 Video Object Tracking Algorithms in 2025 by Haziqa Sajid on 2024-03-08](https://encord.com/blog/video-object-tracking-algorithms/)\nObject tracking has become a fundamental part of the computer vision ecosystem. It powers various modern artificial intelligence applications and is behind several revolutionary technologies, such as self-driving cars, surveillance, and action recognition systems.\n\nTracking algorithms use a combination of object detection and object tracking to detect and localize entities within a video frame. These algorithms range from basic machine learning to complex deep learning networks. Each of these has different implementations and use cases.\n\nThis article will discuss the top 10 most popular video object-tracking algorithms. It will go over video object-tracking algorithms' back-end implementations, advantages, and disadvantages. We will also explore popular computer vision applications for object tracking.\n\nWhat is Video Object Tracking?\n\nVideo object tracking refers to detecting an object within a video frame and tracking its position throughout the video. The concept of object tracking stems from object detection, a popular computer vision (CV) technique used for identifying and localizing different objects in images.\n\nWhile object detection works on still images (single frames), video object tracking applies this concept to every frame in the video. It analyzes each frame to identify the object in question and draw a bounding box around it. The object is effectively tracked throughout the video by performing this operation on all frames.\n\nHowever, complex machine learning and deep learning algorithms apply additional techniques such as region proposal and trajectory prediction for real-time object inference.\n\nObject tracking algorithms have revolutionized several industries. It has enabled businesses to implement analytics and automation in various domains and led to applications like:\n\nAutonomous Vehicles: Tracking surrounding elements like pedestrians, roads, curbs.\n\nAutomated Surveillance: Tracking people or illegal objects like guns and knives.\n\nSports Analytics: Tracking the ball or players to create match strategies.\n\nAugmented Reality Applications: Tracking all objects in the visual field to superimpose the virtual elements.\n\nCustomer Analysis in Retail: Tracking retail store customers to understand movement patterns and optimize shelf placement.\n\nOver the years, object tracking algorithms have undergone various improvements in-terms of accuracy and performance. Let’s discuss these in detail.\n\nSingle-stage Object Detectors Vs. Two-stage Object Detectors\n\nObject detection is a crucial part of tracking algorithms. Hence, it is vital to understand them in detail. There are two main categories of object detectors: Single-stage and two-stage. Both these methodologies have proven to provide exceptional results. However, each offers different benefits, with the former having a lower inference time and the latter having better accuracy.\n\nSingle-stage detectors perform faster since they rely on a single network to produce annotations. These models skip intermediate feature extraction steps, such as region proposal. They use the raw input image to identify objects and generate bounding box coordinates. One example of a single-stage detector is You only look once (YOLO). YOLO can generate annotations with a single pass of the image.\n\nSingle Stage Vs. Two-Stage Detection\n\nTwo-stage detectors, such as Fast R-CNN, comprise two networks. The first is a region proposal network (RPN) that analyzes the image and extracts potential regions containing the desired objects. The second network is a CNN-based feature extractor that analyzes the proposed regions. The latter identifies the objects present and outputs their bounding box coordinates.\n\nTwo-stage object detectors are computationally expensive compared to their single-stage counterparts. However, they produce more accurate results.\n\nObject Tracking Approaches\n\nObject tracking algorithms work on two granularity levels. These include:\n\nSingle Object Tracking (SOT)\n\nSOT is used to track the location of a single object throughout the video feed. These detection-free algorithms depend on the user to provide a bounding box around the target object on the first frame. The algorithm learns to track the position and movement of the object present within the box. It localizes the object's shape, posture, and trajectory in every subsequent frame.\n\nSingle object tracking is useful when the focus must be kept on a particular entity. Some examples include tracking suspicious activity in surveillance footage or ball-tracking in sports analytics.\n\nPopular SOT algorithms include Particle Filters and Siamese Networks. However, one downside of traditional SOT algorithms is that they are unsuitable for context-aware applications where tracking multiple objects is necessary.\n\nMultiple Object Tracking (MOT)\n\nMOT works on the same concept as SOT. However, multi-object tracking identifies and tracks multiple objects throughout a video instead of a single object. MOT algorithms use extensive training datasets to understand moving objects. Once trained, they can identify and track multiple objects within each frame. Modern deep-learning MOT algorithms, like DeepSORT, can even detect new objects mid-video and create new tracks for them while keeping existing tracks intact.\n\nMultiple-object tracking is useful when various objects must be analyzed simultaneously. For example, in virtual reality (VR) applications, the algorithm must keep track of all objects in the frame to superimpose the virtual elements. However, these algorithms are computationally expensive and require lengthy training time.\n\nPhases of Object Tracking Process\n\nVisual object tracking is a challenging process comprising several phases.\n\nTarget Initialization: The first step is to define all the objects of interest using labels and bounding boxes. The annotations, which include the names and locations of all the objects to be tracked, are specified in the first video frame. The algorithm then learns to identify these objects in all the subsequent images or video sequences.\n\nAppearance Modelling: An object may undergo visual transformation throughout the video due to varying lighting conditions, motion blur, image noise, or physical augmentations. This phase of the object-tracking process aims to capture these various transformations to improve the model’s robustness. It includes constructing object descriptions and mathematical models to identify objects with different appearances.\n\nMotion Estimation: Once the object features are defined, motion estimation predicts the object’s position based on the previous frame data. This is achieved by leveraging linear regression techniques or Particle Filters.\n\nTarget Positioning: Motion estimation provides an estimate of the object's position. The next step is to pinpoint the exact coordinates within the predicted region. This is accomplished using a greedy search, i.e., checking every possibility or a maximum posterior estimation that looks at the most likely place using visual clues.\n\nCriteria for Selecting a Video Object Tracking Algorithm\n\nThe two primary criteria to evaluate object tracking methods are accuracy and inference time. These help determine the best algorithm for particular use cases. Let’s discuss these criteria in detail.\n\nAccuracy\n\nTracking algorithms output two main predictions: object identity (label) and location (bounding box coordinates). The accuracy of these models is determined by evaluating both these predictions and analyzing how well it was able to identify and localize the object.\n\nMetrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score help evaluate the model's ability to classify the found object. While accuracy provides a generic picture, precision, and recall judge the model based on occurrences of false positives and negatives.\n\nMetrics like intersection-over-union (IoU) are used for localization accuracy. IoU calculates how much the predicted bounding box coincides with its ground truth value. A higher value means higher intersection and, hence, higher accuracy.\n\nIntersection Over Union (IoU)\n\nInference Time\n\nThe second judgment criterion is the speed of inference. Inference time determines how quickly the algorithm processes a video frame and predicts the object label and location. It is often measured in frames-per-second (FPS). This refers to the amount of frames the algorithm can process and output every second. A higher FPS value indicates faster inference.\n\nChallenges in Object Tracking\n\nObject tracking techniques carry various benefits for different industries. However, implementing a robust tracking algorithm is quite challenging. Some key challenges include:\n\nObject Variety: The real world comes with countless objects. Training a generic tracking algorithm would require an extensive dataset containing millions of objects. For this reason, object tracking models are generally domain-specific, with even the vastest models trained on only a few thousand objects.\n\nVarying Conditions: Besides the object variety, the training data must also cover objects in different conditions. A single object must be captured in different lighting conditions, seasons, times of day, and from different camera angles.\n\nVarying Image Quality: Images from different lenses produce varying information in terms of color production, saturation, etc. A robust model must incorporate these variations to cover all real-world scenarios.\n\nComputation Costs: Handling large image or video datasets requires considerable expertise and computational power. Developers need access to top-notch GPUs and data-handling tools, which can be expensive. Training deep-learning-based tracking algorithms can also increase operational costs if you use paid platforms that charge based on data units processed.\n\nScalability: Training general-purpose object tracking models requires extensive datasets. The growing data volumes introduce scalability challenges as developers require platforms that can handle increasingly large volumes of data and can increase computation power to train larger complex models.\n\nTop Algorithms for Video Object Tracking\n\nHere is a list of popular object tracking algorithms, ranging from simple mathematical models to complex deep learning architectures.\n\nKalman Filter\n\nKalman filters estimate an object’s position and predict its motion in subsequent frames. They maintain an internal representation of the object's state, including its position, velocity, and sometimes acceleration.\n\nThe filters use information from the object’s previous state and a mathematical model analyzing the object’s motion to predict a future state. The model accounts for any uncertainty in the object's motion (noise). It incorporates all the discussed factors and estimates the object’s current state to create a future representation.\n\nAdvantages\n\nIt is a mathematical model that does not require any training.\n\nIt is computationally efficient.\n\nDisadvantage\n\nSubpar performance and capabilities compared to modern deep learning algorithms.\n\nThe model works on various assumptions, such as constant object acceleration.\n\nThe algorithm does not perform well in random motion scenarios.\n\nKCF (Kernelized Correlation Filters)\n\nKCF is a mathematical model that understands object features and learns to distinguish them from their background. It starts with the user providing a bounding box around the object in the first frame.\n\nOnce feature understanding is complete, it uses correlation filters based on the kernel trick to construct a high-dimensional relationship between the features and the true object. It uses the correlation features in subsequent frames to scan around the object's last known location. The area with the highest correlation is predicted to contain the object.\n\nAdvantages\n\nFast Computation.\n\nLow Memory Requirement.\n\nCompetitive Results in general cases.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nTraditional KCF faces challenges in conditions such as varying object scales or objects touching frame boundaries.\n\nDeepSORT\n\nThe Deep Simple Online Realtime Tracking (DeepSORT) algorithm extends the original SORT algorithm. The original SORT algorithm used Kalman filters to predict object motion and the Hungarian algorithm for frame-by-frame data association. However, this algorithm struggles with occlusions and varying camera angles and can lose object tracking in such complex scenarios.\n\nDeepSORT Architecture\n\nDeepSORT uses an additional convolutional neural network (CNN) as a feature extractor. These are called appearance features as they learn to determine the object identity (appearance) in different scenarios and allow the algorithm to distinguish between moving objects. DeepSORT combines the information from Filtering and CNN to create a deep association metric for accurate detection.\n\nAdvantages\n\nDeepSort’s simple yet efficient implementation provides real-time performance.\n\nThe model is modular. It can support any detection network of the user's choice, such as YOLO or SSD.\n\nIt maintains its detection during occluded environments and can distinguish between different objects in complex scenarios.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nOffline training of a separate detection network can be challenging and requires an extensive dataset for high accuracy.\n\nFairMOT\n\nThe fair multi-object tracking (FairMOT) algorithm uses a pre-trained model like faster R-CNN for detecting objects in the video sequence. It then uses a neural network to extract features from the detected object.\n\nFairMOT Architecture\n\nThese features are used to track the object across other frames. The branches share the same underlying architecture and receive equal weightage during training.\n\nThe FairMOT algorithm treats all classes fairly and provides a balanced performance between the two tasks: detection and tracking.\n\nAdvantages\n\nProvides balanced performance between tracking and detection.\n\nImproved tracking accuracy due to the re-identification branch (feature extraction branch)\n\nDisadvantage\n\nComputationally expensive due to the two neural network branches being trained.\n\nMDNet\n\nThe multi-domain network (MDNet) is popular for learning across different domains. It consists of two modules. The first is a CNN architecture shared amongst all the video sequences, i.e., it is domain-independent and learns from the entire dataset. This consists of CNN layers and a few flattened, fully connected layers.\n\nMDNet Architecture\n\nThe second part comprises parallel fully connected (FC) layers, each processing domain-specific information. If the data captures information from 5 domains, the second portion will have 5 FC layers. Each of these layers is independently updated during back-propagation depending on the domain of the target image.\n\nAdvantages\n\nExcellent performance across different domains.\n\nThe domain-specific branches can be fine-tuned on the fly if significant domain shifts are detected.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nIf data is imbalanced, the model will display uneven performance across the different domains.\n\nYOLOv8 (You Only Look Once)\n\nYOLOv8 is a single stage-detector that ranks among the most popular object tracking algorithms. The YOLO family of models is based on a CNN architecture that learns to predict object labels and positions with a single pass of the image.\n\nYolov8 Tasks Catalog\n\nThe model v8 follows a similar architecture to its predecessor and consists of various CNN and fully connected layers. It is an anchor-free algorithm, which directly predicts the object’s center rather than an offset from a predefined anchor. Moreover, the algorithm can be used for classification, segmentation, pose estimation, object detection, and tracking.\n\nYOLOv8 extends its detection capabilities by providing a range of trackers. Two popular options amongst these are Bot-SORT and ByteTrack. All the trackers are customizable, and users can fine-tune parameters like confidence threshold and tracking area.\n\nAdvantages\n\nThe model covers various use cases, including tracking and segmentation.\n\nHigh accuracy and performance.\n\nEasy Python Interface.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nTrouble detecting small objects.\n\nYOLOv8 provides various model sizes, each trading performance for accuracy.\n\nHere’s all you need to know about the YOLO family of model. Read more about YOLO models for Object Detection Explained [YOLOv8 Updated]\n\nSiamese Neural Networks (SNNs)\n\nSiamese-based tracking algorithms consist of two parallel branches of neural networks. One is a template branch, which contains the template image (including the object bounding box information) and the next frame where the object is to be found. This branch consists of CNNs and pooling layers and extracts features from both images, such as edges, texture, and shape.\n\nA fully convolutional siamese network for object tracking\n\nThe other is the similarity branch that takes the features from the template and search image. It calculates the similarity between the two images using algorithms like contrastive loss. The output of this network is the likelihood of the object being present at different positions in the image.\n\nThe Siamese network has had various advancements over the years. The modern architectures include attention mechanisms and RPNs for improved performance.\n\nAdvantages\n\nMultiple advancements, including SiamFC, SiamRPN, etc.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nTraining two parallel networks leads to long training times.\n\nGOTURN (Generic Object Tracking Using Regression Networks)\n\nGeneric Object Tracking Using Regression Networks (GOTURN) is a deep learning based offline learning algorithm. The framework accepts two images, a previous frame and a current frame. The previous frame contains the object at its center, and the image is cropped to 2 times the bounding box size. The current frame is cropped in the same location, but the object is off-center as it has supposedly moved from its position.\n\nGOTURN High-level Architecture\n\nThe internal structure of the model consists of convolutional layers taken from the CaffeNet architecture. Each of the two frames is passed through these layers, and the output is concatenated and processed through a series of fully connected layers. The objective of the network is to learn features from the previous frame and predict the bounding box in the current.\n\nAdvantages\n\nExcellent performance, even on CPU.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nTroubled in scenarios where only some part of the object is visible.\n\nObject tracking is highly affected by imbalanced training data.\n\nWant to know more about creating a fair dataset? Read more about Balanced and Imbalanced Datasets in Machine Learning [Full Introduction]\n\nTLD (Tracking, Learning, and Detection)\n\nTLD is a framework designed for long-term tracking of an unknown object in a video sequence. The three components serve the following purpose:\n\nTracker: Predicts the object location in the next frame using information in the current frame. This module uses techniques like mean-shift or correlation filtering.\n\nDetector: Scans the input frame-by-frame for potential objects using previously learned object appearances.\n\nLearning: Observes the tracker's and the detector's performance and identifies their errors. It further generates training samples to teach the detector to avoid mistakes in the future.\n\nTracking-Learning-Detection\n\nAdvantages\n\nReal-time performance.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nSensitive to illumination changes.\n\nCan lose track of the object if it is completely occluded in any frame.\n\nCan fail if the object appearance changes mid-video.\n\nMedian Flow Tracker\n\nThe Median Flow Tracker predicts object movement in videos by analyzing feature points across frames. It estimates optical flow, filters out unreliable measurements, and uses the remaining data to update the object's bounding box.\n\nTracking using Median Flow\n\nInternally, it tracks motion in both forward and backward directions and compares the two trajectories.\n\nAdvantages\n\nWorks well for predictable motion.\n\nDisadvantage\n\nFails in scenarios of abrupt and random motion.\n\nApplications of Video Object Tracking\n\nVideo Object Tracking has important use-cases in various industries. These use-cases automate laborious tasks and provide critical analytics.

      "# [How to Enhance Text AI Quality with Advanced Text Annotation Techniques by Alexandre Bonnet on 2024-12-13](https://encord.com/blog/enhance-text-ai-quality/)\nThis analysis clarifies that Mary is the one performing the action of selling, the book is the object being sold, and John is the recipient of the book. By assigning these semantic roles, SRL helps in understanding the relationships between entities in a sentence, which is essential for various natural language processing applications.\n\nTemporal annotation\n\nIn Temporal annotation, temporal expressions (such as dates, times, durations, and frequencies) in text are identified. This process enables machines to understand and process time-related information, which is crucial for applications like event sequencing, timeline generation, and temporal reasoning. Key Components of Temporal Annotation:\n\nTemporal Expression Recognition: Identifying phrases that denote time, such as \"yesterday,\" \"June 5, 2023,\" or \"two weeks ago.\"\n\nNormalization: Converting these expressions into a standard, machine-readable format, often aligning them with a specific calendar date or time.\n\nTemporal Relation Identification: Determining the relationships between events and temporal expressions to understand the sequence and timing of events.\n\nExample:\n\nConsider the sentence:\n\n\"The conference was held on March 15, 2023, and the next meeting is scheduled for two weeks later.\"\n\nThe temporal annotation would be:\n\nSeveral standards have been developed to guide temporal annotation:\n\nTimeML: A specification language designed to annotate events, temporal expressions, and their relationships in text.\n\nISO-TimeML: An international standard based on TimeML, providing guidelines for consistent temporal annotation.\n\nIntent annotation\n\nIn Intent annotation, also known as intent classification, the underlying purpose or goal behind a text is identified. This technique enables machines to understand what action a user intends to perform. This is essential for applications like chatbots, virtual assistants, and customer service automation.\n\nExample:\n\nConsider the user input:\n\n\"I need to book a flight to New York next Friday.\"\n\nThe identified Intent is\n\nIntent: \"Book Flight\"\n\nIn this example, the system recognizes that the user's intent is to book a flight which allows the system to proceed with actions related to flight reservations.\n\nThe Role of a Text Annotator\n\nA text annotator plays an important role in the development, refinement, and maintenance of NLP systems and other text-based machine learning models.\n\nThe core responsibility of a text annotator is to enhance raw textual data with structured labels, tags, or metadata that make it understandable and usable by machine learning models. Because machine learning models rely heavily on examples to learn patterns (such as understanding language structure, sentiment, entities, or intent) and must be provided with consistent, high-quality annotations. The work of a text annotator is to ensure that these training sets are accurate, consistent, and reflective of the complexities of human language.\n\nKey responsibilities includes:\n\nData Labeling: Assigning precise labels to text elements, including identifying named entities (e.g., names of people, organizations, locations) and categorizing documents into specific topics.\n\nContent Classification: Organizing documents or text snippets into relevant categories to facilitate structured data analysis.\n\nQuality Assurance: Reviewing and validating annotations to ensure consistency and accuracy across datasets.\n\nAdvanced Text Annotation Techniques\n\nModern generative AI models and associated tools have expanded and streamlined the capabilities of text annotation to great extent. Generative AI models can accelerate and enhance the annotation process and reduce the required manual effort. Following are some advanced text annotation techniques:\n\nZero-Shot and Few-Shot Annotation with Large Language Models\n\nZero-shot and few-shot learning enables text annotators to generate annotations for tasks without requiring thousands of manually labeled examples. Text annotators can provide natural language instructions, examples, or prompts to an LLM to classify text or tag entities based on their pre-training and the guidance given in the prompt.\n\nFor example, in Zero-shot annotation a text annotator may describe the annotation task and categories (e.g., “Label each sentence as ‘Positive,’ ‘Negative,’ or ‘Neutral’”) LLM. The LLM then annotates text based on its internal understanding.\n\nSimilarly for Few-shot Annotation, the text annotator provides a few examples of annotated data (e.g., 3-5 sentences with their corresponding labels), and the LLM uses these examples to infer the labeling scheme. It then applies this understanding to new, unseen text.\n\nPrompt Engineering for Structured Annotation\n\nLLMs respond to natural language instructions. Prompt engineering involves carefully designing the text prompt given to these models to improve the quality, consistency, and relevance of the generated annotations. An instruction template provides the model with a systematic set of instructions describing the annotation schema. For example: “You are an expert text annotator. Classify the following text into one of these categories: {Category A}, {Category B}, {Category C}. If unsure, say {Uncertain}.”\n\nUsing Generative AI to Assist with Complex Annotation Tasks\n\nSome annotation tasks (like relation extraction, event detection, or sentiment analysis with complex nuances) can be challenging. Generative AI can break down these tasks into simpler steps, provide explanations, and highlight text segments that justify certain labels. An LLM can be instructed by text annotators to first identify entities (e.g., people, places, organizations) and then determine relationships between them. The LLM can also summarize larger text before annotation. In this way the annotator focuses on relevant sections and speeding up human-in-the-loop processes.\n\nIntegration with Annotation Platforms\n\nModern annotation platforms and MLOps tools are integrating generative AI features to assist annotators. For example, they allow an LLM to produce initial annotations, which annotators then refine. Over time, these corrections feed into active learning loops that improve model performance.\n\nFor example, the active learning and model-assisted workflows in Encord can be adapted for text annotation. By connecting an LLM that provides draft annotations, human annotators can quickly correct mistakes. Those corrections help the model learn and improve. The other tools like Label Studio or Prodigy can include LLM outputs directly into the annotation interface, making the model’s suggestions easy to accept, modify, or reject.\n\nPractical Applications of Text Annotation\n\nText annotation can be used in various domains. Following are some examples of text annotation to enhance applications, improve data understanding, and provide better end-user experiences.\n\nHealthcare\n\nThe healthcare industry generates vast amounts of text data every day consisting of patient records, physician notes, pathology reports, clinical trial documentation, insurance claims, and medical literature. However, these documents are often unstructured, making it difficult to use them for analytics, research, or clinical decision support. Text annotation makes this unstructured data more accessible and useful. Following are some examples:\n\nIn Electronic Health Record (EHR) analysis medical entities such as symptoms, diagnoses, medications, dosages, and treatment plans in a patient’s EHR are identified and annotated. Once annotated, these datasets enable algorithms to automatically extract critical patient information.\n\nA model might highlight that a patient with diabetes (diagnosis) is taking metformin (medication) and currently experiences fatigue (symptom). This helps physicians quickly review patient histories, ensure treatment adherence, and detect patterns that may influence treatment decisions.\n\nE-Commerce\n\nE-commerce platforms handle large amounts of customer data such as product descriptions, user-generated reviews, Q&A sections, support tickets, chat logs, and social media mentions. Text annotation helps structure this data, enabling advanced search, personalized recommendations, better inventory management, and improved customer service.\n\nFor example, in product categorization and tagging the product titles and descriptions with categories, brands, material, style, or size etc. are annotated. Annotated product information allows recommendation systems to group similar items and suggest complementary products. For instance, if a product is tagged as “women’s sports shoes,” the recommendation engine can show running socks or athletic apparel. This enhances product discovery, making it easier for customers to find what they’re looking for, ultimately increasing sales and customer satisfaction.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nSentiment analysis focuses on determining the emotional tone of text. Online reviews, social media posts, comments, and feedback forms contain valuable insights into customer feelings, brand perception, and emerging trends. Annotating this text with sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral) enables models to gauge public opinion at scale.\n\nFor example, in brand reputation management user tweets, blog comments, and forum posts are annotated as positive, negative, or neutral toward the brand or a product line. By analyzing aggregated sentiment over time, companies can detect negative spikes that indicate PR issues or product defects. They can then take rapid corrective measures, such as addressing a manufacturing flaw or releasing a statement. It helps maintain a positive brand image, guides marketing strategies, and improves customer trust.\n\n💡 Read our complete Guide to Text Annotation.\n\nEnhancing Text Data Quality with Encord\n\nEncord offers a comprehensive document annotation tool designed to streamline the text annotation for training LLM.
