      "# [The influence of bio-based monomers on the structure and thermal properties of polyurethanes on 2024-11-23](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-80358-6)\nCommercial, polyurethanes (PU)s are obtained by the polyaddition reaction of di- or polyisocyanates with polyols and chain extenders1,2,3. Polyols and isocyanates are the main components of the formulation, which significantly determine the properties of the PU materials4,5. The amount of isocyanate in the formulation is generally around 30–40 parts by weight. The isocyanate-derived parts of PU structure can form hard segments (HS), which are responsible for the hardness, mechanical strength, and thermal stability of PU materials6,7,8. Unfortunately, the commercial-available isocyanates are of petrochemical origin, obtained by the reaction of amines with toxic phosgene. Isocyanate synthesis is highly unfavorable, dangerous to human health and not environmentally friendly7,9,10. Therefore, research has been carried out to find alternative and more environmentally friendly solutions to produce isocyanates using a safer synthesis route and non-petrochemical raw materials11.\n\nUp to now, only a few bio-based polyisocyanates have been described in the literature12,13,14. Commercially available polyisocyanates are mainly derived from plants (fatty acids). Currently, there are three main types of bio-based isocyanates on the market: 1,5-penthamethylene diisocyanate (PDI) and its oligomers; L-lysine ethyl ester diisocyanate (LDI)15; and diisocyanate derived from 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) and palm oil16. Covestro produces bio-derived PDI from plant sugars using a synthesis process that significantly reduces energy consumption. The PDI has a green carbon content of over 71% and although this bio-based monomer is not commercially available, it is further used to synthesize an aliphatic PDI trimer. This trimer is available on the market under the trade name DESMODUR® eco N 730017 and is dedicated to the synthesis of PU coating systems that are resistant to light, weather, and scratches17.\n\nAliphatic polyisocyanurates based on bio-based 1,5-pentamethylene diisocyanate is produced by Mitsui Chemicals under the trade name STABIO™ PDI. The offered monomer is available in two variants with low and high viscosity. The company recommends to use it for the synthesis of PU-urea materials18.\n\nAnother bio-based diisocyanate producer is Vencorex Chemicals, which offers an aliphatic bio-monomer under the trade name Tolonate™ X FLO 100. It is obtained from vegetable oil derivatives with a green carbon content of up to 32%. This monomer is used for the synthesis of elastomers and PU coatings16. As the exact chemical formula of this diisocyanate was not disclosed by the manufacturer, the authors of the publication “Fully Bio-Based Thermosetting Polyurethanes from Bio-Based Polyols and Isocyanates” proposed its structure based on electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS negative)19. Based on this, Tolonate™ X FLO 100 contains a long-chain side group (labelled RO-) derived from vegetable oils. This complicates the synthesis of PUs due to the presence of additional functional groups and double bonds in the RO- labeled bio-diisocyanate fragment, resulting in additional cross-linking of the material.\n\nThe raw materials market for the synthesis of PUs also includes L-lysine ethyl ester bio-diisocyanate (LDI)20. It is produced from the amino acid L-lysine extracted from plant biomass. The LDI-based PUs exhibit low toxicity and biodegradability21.\n\nFurthermore, companies like General Mills Inc22,23. and BASF Europe24 have developed isocyanates derived from fatty acid dimers. These innovative compounds have found applications in multiple industries, particularly in the production of ultraviolet-curable coatings, where they offer enhanced performance and sustainability.\n\nIt is well known that some applications require PUs to have special properties, including resistance to very high temperatures. For example, high-temperature resistant adhesives are required in advanced aircraft, rockets, and ground vehicles25. Therefore, an important parameter determined in the analysis of PU materials is their thermal stability, which describes the thermal durability of PU26. Polymers with higher thermal stability have higher melting, softening, and thermal decomposition temperatures, lower weight loss during heating at high temperatures, without losing their basic properties27. Various tests are carried out to evaluate these properties, including thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) or differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). This paper focuses on a detailed analysis of the structure and thermal stability of the obtained bio-based PUs as promising alternatives to the current petrochemical PUs.\n\nIn this work, renewable monomers were used to synthesize bio-based PU by polyaddition reaction. The reference PU materials were prepared from the petrochemical polyols and hexamethylene diisocyanate, using 1,3-propanediol as a chain extender. Meanwhile, the preparation of polyurethanes based on bio-based monomers with desired thermal properties remains an open challenge. Here, we describe the synthesis and characterization of novel polyurethanes based on bio-based PO3G (polyether polyol), semi-crystalline, bio-based polyester polyol (Priplast 3294), and partially bio-based isocyanate Tolonate X FLO 100 with bio-based chain extender 1,3-propanediol. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Small and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SWAXS) were used to characterize all samples. The thermal properties of PUs were studied by TGA, DSC, DMTA and combination of FTIR spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis (TG-FTIR).\n\nMaterials\n\nFor reference samples, two types of polyols were used: polyether polyol - poly(tetramethylene glycol) (PTMG) supplied by Overlack (Ozorków, Poland) and polyester polyol - Polios 55/20 purchased from Purinova (Bydgoszcz Poland) both with a molecular weight of 2000 g/mol. Hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI), 1,3-propanediol (PDO) and catalyst dibutyltin dilaurate were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Saint Louis, USA) and used as received. The reaction inhibitor was orthophosphoric acid supplied by POCH Gliwice (Gliwice, Poland).\n\nFor the synthesis based on renewable raw materials we used aliphatic isocyanate Tolonate X FLO 100 purchased from Vencorex (Saint-Priest, France) and two types of polyols: polyester polyol - PRIPLAST 3294™ purchased from Croda (Snaith, UK) and polyether polyol - Velvetol H2000 supplied by Allessa GmbH (Frankfurt, Germany) both with a molecular weight of 2000 g/mol. The chain extender Zemea (1,3-propanediol) was purchased from DuPont Tate & Lyle Bio Product (Naucalpan de Juárez, USA). The same catalyst and inhibitor were used as for the reference samples. The chemicals were used without further purification unless stated otherwise.\n\nSynthesis of PU elastomers\n\nThe PUs were obtained using a two-step prepolymer method. The first step was to synthesize the prepolymer by reacting the polyol with an excess of diisocyanate at 85 °C for 2 h under vacuum. During the reaction, the percentage of NCO groups were determined by titration according to ISO 14896:2010 (isocyanate is reacted with an excess of n-dibutyl amine to form substituted ureas. The excess dibutyl amine is then back-titrated with aqueous hydrochloric acid. The solvent used is acetone). A chain extender and catalyst (0.1% DBTL) were then added to the prepolymer, and the mixture was stirred for 60 s. and degassed under vacuum for 60 s. The molar ratios of [NCO]/[OH] groups was 1.05. Finally, the materials were cured in a laboratory oven at 80-100 °C for 24 h. Figure 1 shows the overall method for the synthesis of ethers and ester-urethanes from bio-based monomers. Table 1 presents the formulation of the synthesized samples, the content of unreacted isocyanate groups in prepolymers (NCO content) and the content of HS. The content of bio-monomers (bio-content) was calculated using Eq. (1) and is given in Table 1.\n\n$$\\:bio-content=\\:\\frac{{M}_{BIO}}{{M}_{TOTAL}}\\times\\:100\\varvec{\\%}$$\n\n(1)\n\n\\(\\:{M}_{BIO}\\) - the molar mass of the used bio-monomers. \\(\\:{M}_{TOTAL}\\) – the molar mass of all substrates used.\n\nMethods of characterization\n\nFourier transform infrared spectroscopy\n\nThe chemical structure of the bio-based PU was analyzed by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy using a Spectrum 100T FT-IR spectrometer with universal ATR accessory (PerkinElmer, USA). Each spectrum was recorded at room temperature for wavenumber range of 500 to 4500 cm− 1 with a resolution of 4 cm− 1.\n\nThe degree of the carbonyl groups participating in hydrogen bonding can be described by the carbonyl.\n\nhydrogen bonding index, R, as given in Eq. (2).\n\n$$\\:R=\\frac{{A}_{bonded}}{{A}_{free}}$$\n\n(2)\n\nwhere A is the intensity of the characteristic absorbance (AH−bonded – absorption intensity of hydrogen-bonded carbonyl; AH−free – absorption intensity of free carbonyl). The degree of phase separation (DPS) and the degree of phase mixing (DPM) can be obtained by using Eqs. (3) and (4), respectively.\n\n$$\\:DPS=\\:\\frac{R}{R+1}$$\n\n(3)\n\n$$\\:DPM=1-DPS$$\n\n(4)\n\nNuclear magnetic resonance\n\n1H NMR spectra of prepared solutions (DMSO or DMF) were acquired with the Bruker Avance III spectrometer operating at 600.2 MHz. The width of 90° pulse was 18 µs, relaxation delay 10 s, acquisition time 2.73 s, 32 scans.\n\nSmall and wide-angle X-ray scattering\n\nThe internal microstructure of PU samples was investigated through Small-Angle and Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS and WAXS) analysis. The measurements were conducted using a pinhole camera (MolMet, Rigaku, Japan, modified by SAXSLAB/Xenocs) connected to a microfocused X-ray beam generator (Rigaku MicroMax 003) operating at 50 kV and 0.6 mA (30 W). Scattering intensities were recorded using a vacuum-compatible hybrid photon-counting detector (Pilatus3 R 300 K), with a sample-to-detector distance of 1000 mm (SAXS) and 50 mm (WAXS), respectively, using an exposure time of 3 h.\n\nThermogravimetric analysis\n\nTGA of the PUs were performed using a Pyris 1 TGA Thermogravimetric Analyzer (PerkinElmer, USA). Approximately 10 mg of the sample was placed in a ceramic crucible and heated from 35 to 600 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min under a nitrogen flow of 20 mL/min. The standard deviation of the TGA measurement was under 5%.\n\nDifferential scanning calorimetry\n\nThe thermal behaviour of the polyurethanes was evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) using a TG 209F1 Libra (NETZSCH, Germany). The samples (5–10 mg) were encapsulated in aluminium hermetic pans. The measurements were carried out in a heating-cooling-heating cycle at the temperature range of (-80) – 250 °C. The analyses were performed at a heating rate of 10 °C/min in an inert (nitrogen) atmosphere.\n\nThermogravimetric analysis coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy\n\nThermogravimetric analysis coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR) was carried out using a Netzsch TG 209 thermal analyser (heating rate = 10 K/min, sample mass 10–15 mg, nitrogen flow = 20 ml/min) and a Bruker Alpha FTIR spectrometer. IR spectra were recorded in the spectral range of 4000–500 cm− 1 with a 4 cm− 1 resolution and 8 scans.\n\nDynamic mechanical and thermal analysis\n\nDynamic-mechanical and thermal analysis (DMTA) of the prepared PU samples was measured on an ARES G2 rheometer (TA Instruments). Oscillatory shear deformation (0.02–1% strain) at a frequency of 1 Hz from − 100 °C to 150 °C at a temperature ramp rate of 3 °C/min was applied on rectangular samples (20 × 5 × 2 mm). The temperature dependence of the complex shear modulus (G*) was observed and the main transition temperature (Tα) was determined to be the tan δ peak maximum.\n\nFourier transform infrared spectroscopy\n\nThe chemical structure of the PUs was confirmed by FTIR-ATR and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The FTIR spectra are shown in Fig. 2 and the characteristic bands are given in Table 2. The characteristic isocyanate (-N = C = O) and polyol (-OH) bands at 2260 cm− 1 and 3600 cm− 1, respectively, were not observed in any of the samples28. Meanwhile, the bands corresponding to the urethane groups in the range of 3400–3300 cm− 1 and the I amide band in the range of 1740–1680 cm− 1 characteristic for the vibration of the -C = O group, confirm the full rearrangement of substrates29,30. At 1528–1540 cm− 1 two vibrations were assigned to the urethane CN-H group part: a bending vibration for N–H and a stretching vibration for C–N. The band at 2937–2850 cm− 1 can be assigned to symmetric and asymmetric CH stretching vibrations originating from the CH2 groups present in aliphatic chains, or from the CH3 groups. The next bands are: stretching vibrations of C–O–C in ether bonds at 1160 –1060 cm− 1 and in ester bonds at 1250 –1150 cm− 1.\n\nThe graphs show no significant differences in structure between the reference samples and bio-PUs, confirming the possibility of obtaining PU from bio-based monomers.\n\nThe obtained values of R, DPS and DPM for PU were given in Table 3. The DPS value describes the contribution of HS bonded among themselves by hydrogen bonds, while the DPM value describes the contribution of HS not bonded by hydrogen bonds to any other HS31. As has been previously reported in the literature, the DPS value in PUs increases with increasing R32. The HPTP sample has the highest value of R and therefore shows the highest phase separation compared to other samples. It was confirmed that the content of HS in the PU structure and the origin of the substrates used in the synthesis affect the DPS value. It was observed that as the HS content increases, DPS decreases. This is related to the fact that materials with a higher content of HS have more urethane groups, which can bond with the ester groups of polyols, increasing interactions between HS and SS and resulting in phase mixing. It was also observed that materials obtained from petrochemical monomers have higher DPS contents. This is in line with reports from other authors who also observed that the highest DPS value was recorded for HDI-based materials. This may be related to the linear structure of this isocyanate33. Moreover, differences were observed due to the nature of the polyol used. PUs based on polyether polyols were characterized by higher DPS values compared to PUs based on polyester polyols. For samples containing branched HS, i.e. based on bio-isocyanate, a decrease in DPS values was observed, probably due to the higher free volume between macromolecules, which hinders the formation of hydrogen bonds.\n\nNuclear magnetic resonance\n\n1H NMR spectra with a description of signals of the samples dissolved in DMSO and DMF are presented in Table 4. The type of solvent was determined by the solubility of the materials tested (due to the limited solubility of the TPTbP and TPribP samples, their spectra were prepared for prepolymers). The signals labeled a (in DMF), f (in DMSO) and k (TPribP in DMSO) in the range of 6.9–8.5 ppm are assigned to -NH in the urethane group. The peaks from 4.0 to 4.3 ppm indicate, hydrogen present in the main chain next to oxygen in the structure of this material. The range 1.2–1.7 corresponds to the protons of the methylene groups derived from the aliphatic chains of the polyol. The peaks in the range of 2.9–3.2 are related to the methylene bridge attached to the urethane nitrogen. FTIR and 1H NMR analyses confirmed the reaction of the -NCO groups of the diisocyanate with the -OH groups of the polyol used, as a signal characteristic of the protons of the -NH group was observed.\n\nX-ray scattering\n\nAll PU samples exhibit two distinct peaks in their SAXS profiles (Fig. 3), though the peak positions vary between samples. These peak positions, along with the corresponding characteristic sizes, are summarized in Table 5. The peak at lower Q-values is attributed to the microphase separation between the soft and hard segments, while the higher-Q peak corresponds to the periodic structure within the hard segment domains.\n\nFor samples containing HDI-based isocyanate, both peaks shift to higher Q-values, indicating a more compact or tightly packed structure, with smaller domain sizes. Additionally, the reduced intensity of the second peak suggests a lower hard segment (HS) content or reduced crystallinity, reflecting fewer or less well-defined hard segment domains.\n\nThe Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (WAXS) curves (Fig. 4) reveal differences in short-range ordering between the HDI-based and Tolonate-based PU samples. These differences are likely due to variations in polymer chain arrangement and crystalline domain structure. The HDI-based samples exhibit several additional diffraction peaks, suggesting the presence of more complex or diverse structural motifs compared to the Tolonate-based PUs.\n\nDifferential scanning calorimetry\n\nThe glass transition temperature (Tg) is an important characteristic of polymeric materials because it represents the boundary between their elastic and viscoelastic behavior. Figures 5 and 6 present DSC thermograms obtained from DSC experiments during the first and second heating of PUs.\n\nThermal behavior of the obtained materials such as, glass transition temperature of SS (TgSS) and HS (TgHS), melting point of SS (TmSS) and HS (TmHS), and enthalpy are presented in Table 6. The Tg values mainly depended on the type of monomers. Glass transition temperatures for SS and HS and melting points for SS and HS were observed. During the first heating in the DSC, we observe melting temperatures for the reference samples, while no melting peaks are detected for the bio-based PU. This confirms our observations from the WAXS results, which show negligible crystallinity for the bio-PU, whereas the reference PU samples have a significantly higher crystalline content (17.5% for HPoP and 24.4% for HPTP). During the 2nd heating the glass transition temperature for SS is mainly observed for polyester based samples. The Tg of the soft segments ranged from − 47.4 °C to -55 °C. The lack of a distinct glass transition peak for polyether-based samples may be related to the morphological characteristics of these materials. The flexibility of the polyether-based segments could reduce the sharpness of the glass transition, making it difficult to observe a distinct Tg peak. On the other hand, melting of the soft segments is observed for the polyether-based samples and the TPobP (polyester-based) sample. This is related to the reorganization of the soft segment microdomains after the second heating cycle, as a result of the removal of the sample’s thermal history during the first heating34. The transition observed for TPTbP sample during the second heating cycle at 22.9 °C was attributed to some relaxation effects of the polymer chain. A melting of the hard segments is observed for the reference samples during 1st and 2nd heating. This may be related to the higher DPS value of these samples. Because HDI-based samples have a more ordered structure than Tolonate-based samples28.\n\nThermogravimetry\n\nTGA is used to measure thermal decomposition and thermal stability of materials. The TGA measurements were carried out on PUs based on both bio-based monomers and petrochemical feedstocks. The aim was to investigate the thermal stability of the prepared materials and to determine the influence of the bio-based substrates on the final properties of the product. The TG and DTG curves are shown in Figs. 7 and 8. Table 7 shows the temperatures for 5%, 50% and 90% mass loss and the ash residue in mass % at 600 °C.\n\nAs it can be observed all samples exhibited two steps of degradation. The first step is attributed to the decomposition of HS, including mainly isocyanate residues and chain extenders. This is caused by the relatively low thermal stability of the urethane groups35. In contrast, the second step is attributed to the decomposition of SS, which is mainly composed of long polyol chains.\n\nFrom the TG curves, it was observed that they are almost superposed, while the DTG curves are only partially overlapped. The bio-based PUs are slightly less stable than the reference samples because their initial decomposition temperature is lower (see Table 7).\n\nThe temperatures for the first step of mass loss are similar, ranging from 237 °C to 248 °C for samples based on polyester, and 238–251 °C for samples based on polyether. Therefore, we can conclude that polyether-based samples are more stable than those on polyester. This is related to the different structures of the polyols (symmetrical and short chain of Velvetol and PTMG, long chain of Polios, branched chain of Priplast). Furthermore, it can be observed that PUs derived from bio-isocyanates degraded at a lower temperature than those based on petrochemical HDI. For comparison, 5% weight loss of HPTP sample occurs at T = 297 °C, and TPTbP sample at T = 284 °C. This is related to the lower thermal stability of bio-based isocyanate compared to the stability of HDI. As the thermal stability of isocyanates is closely related to the symmetry of their structure27. When the symmetry of the isocyanate increases, the stability of the PU increases, so Tolonate X FLO 100 has a lower stability due to its branched structure. However, our Tolonate-based samples had only slightly lower thermal stability than those reported by other scientists, also based on Tolonate and Velvetol (with a different polyol mass, we used 2000 g/mol versus 500 g/mol), where the T5% was 292 °C19.\n\nThermogravimetric analysis coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy\n\nThe gases produced during TGA of the samples at different temperatures (50–800 °C) were analyzed by FTIR spectroscopy. Analysis of the spectra of volatile decomposition products confirmed the relationships presented in the TGA figures. Decomposition of HS occurs in the first step and, according to the literature, leads to the formation of isocyanate and alcohol, primary or secondary amine, olefin, and carbon dioxide8,36. Meanwhile, in the second step, decomposition of SS consisting of polyols occurs. Temperatures in the range of 343–429 °C were chosen as the most representative points to illustrate characteristic groups of gas products.\n\nAll of the FTIR spectra shown in Fig. 9 exhibit absorption bands typical of carbon dioxide, at a wavenumber in the range 2391–2344 cm− 1, associated with asymmetric stretching vibrations, at 696–668 cm− 1, attributed to degenerate bending vibrations, and at 3598–3350 cm− 1 corresponding to combination bands. The spectrum also reveals bands at 2941–2928 cm− 1 and 2865–2849 cm− 1, characteristic of asymmetric and symmetric C-H stretching vibrations, and at 1479–1450 cm− 1, characteristic of asymmetric and symmetric C-H bending vibrations, of methylene and methyl groups.\n\nThe presence of a band at 1060–1067 cm− 1 confirms the formation of primary alcohols, associated with C-O stretching vibrations, and at 3649 –3626 cm− 1, associated with O-H stretching vibrations.\n\nDynamic mechanical and thermal analysis\n\nThe DMTA results show us the supramolecular arrangement of prepared PUs (Fig. 10). The storage modulus curves clearly indicated the main transition in the range of ca. -68 – -28 °C corresponding to the glass transition temperature of SS. From the maximum of the tan delta curves, the main (alpha) temperature (Tα) of SS was determined to be of -34 °C for polyether-based (TPTbP and TVbP) and − 28 °C for polyester-based (TPobP and TPribP) bio-PUs, while the Tα values of the reference samples based on HDI were slightly lower, -68 °C and − 44 °C for HPTP and HPoP, respectively.\n\nThe PU materials based on the bio-based isocyanate Tolonate X FLO 100 were generally more flexible than the materials based on HDI, because in the SS transition region their storage modulus drops sharply by 3 orders of magnitude (from GPa units to MPa units). The subsequent slower decrease of the storage modulus at temperatures above about 0 °C may be related to the melting of crystalline domains, or to Tg of HS. In contrast, the HDI-based PUs were much stiffer materials, as the storage modulus in the transition region of SS only decreased by one order of magnitude. Then there was a gradual decrease of the storage module up to a temperature of about 25 °C, which may be related to the melting of the crystalline phase (see the DSC results above). However, the HDI-derived samples are overall more segregated into SS and HS domains than the bio-based PUs, which was manifested by a significant sharp drop in the storage modulus at temperatures of approx. 120 °C (HPoP) and 130 °C (HPTP), related to the melting of crystalline domains in HS.",

Most raw materials of these thermoset resins are toxic to the health of human beings. To alleviate concerns about the environment and health, the design and synthesis of bio-based epoxy resins using biomass as raw materials have been widely studied in recent decades to replace petroleum-based epoxy resins. With the improvement in the requirements for the performance of bio-based epoxy resins, the design of bio-based epoxy resins with unique functions has attracted a lot of attention, and bio-based epoxy resins with flame-retardant, recyclable/degradable/reprocessable, antibacterial, and other functional bio-based epoxy resins have been developed to expand the applications of epoxy resins and improve their competitiveness. This review summarizes the research progress of functional bio-based epoxy resins in recent years. First, bio-based epoxy resins were classified according to their unique function, and synthesis strategies of functional bio-based epoxy resins were discussed, then the relationship between structure and performance was revealed to guide the synthesis of functional bio-based epoxy resins and stimulate the development of more types of functional bio-based epoxy resins. Finally, the challenges and opportunities in the development of functional bio-based epoxy resins are presented.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nEpoxy resin is a three-dimensional polymer network with insoluble and insoluble properties generated after the cross-linking reaction of epoxy monomer or oligomer with a curing agent [1,2,3]. Epoxy resin has the advantage of excellent thermal and mechanical properties, chemical resistance, and dimensional stability, and it can be applied in aerospace, coatings, high-performance composites, electronic encapsulants, and other fields [4,5,6,7]. At present, more than 90% of the world’s epoxy resin is composed of bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (DGEBA), formed from bisphenol A (BPA) and epichlorohydrin (ECH) [1]. Among them, commercial ECH is derived from bio-based glycerol. However, BPA is derived from non-renewable petroleum resources, and excessive use will cause an energy crisis [8]. In addition, BPA is harmful to our health [9]. Due to concerns about health, energy, and the environment, finding suitable biomass as raw materials to replace petroleum-based BPA has become a research hotspot. At present, vegetable oil, itaconic acid (IA), cardanol, and other biomass have been used for the preparation of bio-based epoxy resins [10,11,12,13,14].\n\nFor a long time, the purpose of studying the preparation of bio-based epoxy resin was to find suitable biomass raw materials, so that the performance of the prepared bio-based epoxy resin is comparable to that of petroleum-based epoxy resin, so as to replace petroleum-based epoxy resin. Under the above purpose, some bio-based epoxy resins with similar properties to petroleum-based epoxy resins have been designed [15,16,17,18,19,20,21]. A typical example is the trifunctional epoxy monomer from IA denoted TEIA. TEIA monomer is liquid and has low viscosity (0.92 Pa s, 25 °C) for easy processing. The methylhexahydropthalic anhydride was used as a curing agent to cure TEIA and a petroleum-based epoxy monomer to obtain the corresponding resin. The experimental results showed that TEIA had higher reactivity, and TEIA-based epoxy resin exhibited a higher glass transition temperature (Tg, 135.2 °C vs. 109.5 °C) and a higher flexural strength (157.2 MPa vs. 131.6 MPa) than that of the DGEBA system [18]. More efforts have been made in the research and development of bio-based epoxy resins, as well as the gradual improvement of the requirement for material performance. More and more bio-based epoxy resins with better performance (high Tg, high degradation temperature, high tensile strength, high energy storage modulus) than petroleum-based epoxy resin have been reported [22,23,24,25,26,27,28]. These bio-based epoxy resins mainly use magnolol, resveratrol, vanillin, ferulic acid, etc., as raw materials [22,23,24,25,26,27,28].\n\nAlthough bio-based epoxy resins with better thermal and mechanical properties have been designed and prepared, there are some drawbacks in bio-based epoxy resin that make it impossible to produce on a large scale, such as the high cost of biomass feedstock and the difficulty of processing bio-based epoxy monomers [29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37]. In order to overcome these drawbacks and improve competitiveness, bio-based epoxy resins should not only meet the requirements of better thermal and mechanical properties, but also should be designed to explore their unique functionality, including flame-retardant performance [29,30,31,32], degradability, recyclability, reprocessability [33,34,35], shape memory function [33,34,35], antibacterial properties [36], etc. [37]. This class of bio-based epoxy resins with unique functions has attracted wide attention, and a lot of studies have been conducted in recent years [29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37]. Although there are a large number of reviews on the preparation of bio-based epoxy resins from biomass, most of the reviews focus on their high performance rather than on their functions [2,3,4,5,6,7,10,11,12]. Some reviews only focus on one kind of function, such as flame retardancy, of bio-based epoxy resins [29,30,31,32]. A comprehensive review of the functional bio-based epoxy resins is still lacking. This review aims to summarize the recent development of bio-based epoxy resins with different functions derived from biomass (Scheme 1). On this basis, there is a need to summarize the structural characteristics and synthesis methods of functional bio-based epoxy resins, and reveal the relationship between structure and function to provide methods for the design and synthesis of functional bio-based epoxy resins in the future. Finally, the challenges and opportunities of functional bio-based epoxy resins are discussed.\n\n2. Synthesis Methods of Various Functionalized Bio-Based Epoxy Resins\n\nThe synthesis of commonly used epoxy monomers is shown in Scheme 2. One approach to obtaining the bio-based epoxy monomers is the glycidylation reaction between plant phenols and excess ECH using a phase transfer catalyst in alkaline conditions (Scheme 2A). Another method for the preparation of bio-based monomers is the peroxidation of a carbon–carbon double bond in biomass employing the H2O2 or stronger oxidative reagents such as m-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA) (Scheme 2B) [29].\n\nThe synthesis of functional bio-based epoxy monomers is also achieved by the above two methods. For the synthesis of flame-retardant bio-based epoxy resins, flame-retardant elements such as phosphorus [30], or specific structures that can produce a high char yield at high temperatures, such as rigid and conjugate structures or heterocyclic structures, need to be introduced in the intermediate [31]. For the synthesis of recyclable/degradable/reprocessable bio-based epoxy resins, in the first method, polyphenol intermediates containing dynamic chemical bonds, such as imine bonds, disulfide bonds, etc., are usually synthesized first, and then react with ECH [33,34,35]. In the second approach, the introduction of a bio-based epoxy curing agent with dynamic covalent bonds or the formation of reversible dynamic covalent bonds (such as ester bonds) during the curing process are also valid methods to prepare recyclable bio-based epoxy resins [33,34,35]. In addition, the introduction of dynamic bonds is also a common method to prepare bio-based epoxy resins with shape memory function [33,34,35]. Moreover, the introduction of long alkyl chains in the network structure of epoxy resins can also be used to design shape memory epoxy resins [36]. The synthesis of antibacterial bio-based epoxy resins is usually achieved by introducing groups with antibacterial effects such as a hydroxyl group and Schiff base [36].\n\n3. Functional Bio-Based Epoxy Resins\n\n3.1. Flame Retardant\n\nBio-based epoxy resins have the same or better performance than petroleum-based epoxy resins, but they also suffer from the disadvantage of being flammable, which limits their application in areas, such as the electrical and electronic industries where flame retardancy is needed [29,30,31,32]. Therefore, new bio-based epoxy resins with flame retardancy have been widely developed. The bio-based epoxy resin with intrinsic flame retardancy refers to giving itself flame-retardant properties by introducing suitable biomass or a flame-retardant monomer into the epoxy resin network by covalent bonds. The main methods usually include (1) introducing flame-retardant elements such as P [30], and (2) introducing biomass having a high char yield [31]. The bio-based flame-retardant epoxy resins exert their flame-retardant effect through several mechanisms, such as capturing gas-phase free radicals, coverage effect, dilution effect, endothermic effect, and synergy effect. Generally, many bio-based flame-retardant epoxy resins achieve the flame-retardant effect through the joint action of several mechanisms [29,30,31,32]. When burned, a compact and continuous char layer covering the surface of polymeric materials is formed, which has the functions of heat insulation, oxygen isolation, and preventing flammable gas from escaping outward, to achieve the purpose of flame retardancy. In this process, a large number of non-combustible gases (CO2, N2, NH3, etc.) can be produced, so that the concentration of oxygen and other combustible gases produced by the decomposition of epoxy resins are diluted and cannot reach the lower limit of the combustion concentration range in the combustion zone. Furthermore, epoxy resins undergo decomposition or other endothermic reactions under high-temperature conditions, which reduce the temperature of epoxy resins and combustion zone, and effectively inhibit the generation of combustible gas and continuous combustion reaction [29,30,31,32]. For phosphorus-containing flame-retardant bio-based epoxy resins, active free radicals such as PO•, PO2•, and HPO2• are generated during thermal decomposition and combustion process, which capture free radicals such as H• and HO• in the gas phase to generate table compounds, reducing the concentration of combustible free radicals in the gas phase and hindering the continuous combustion of epoxy resin [30]. At present, flame-retardant bio-based epoxy resins are divided into two categories: phosphorus-containing and phosphorus-free according to the flame-retardant mechanism.\n\n3.1.1. Phosphorus-Containing Flame-Retardant Bio-Based Epoxy Thermosets\n\nFlame retardants containing phosphorous, for instance, 9,10-dihydro-9-oxo-10-phosphaphenanthrene-10-oxide (DOPO) [38,39,40,41,42,43], hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene (HCCP) [44,45], and various phosphates [46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57] (Scheme 3), have gained great popularity in contemporary society due to their low toxicity, high efficiency, multiple flame-retardant mechanisms, and molecular diversity. Some research advances about phosphorus-containing flame-retardant bio-based epoxy thermosets are shown in Table 1 (yellow part), and some typical examples are briefly described. The research progress of phosphorus-containing flame-retardant bio-based epoxy resin is classified and discussed below, according to the different sources of phosphorus.\n\nPhosphaphenanthrene-based bio-based epoxy resin. DOPO is one of the most commonly used phosphorus-containing flame-retardant compounds, with high thermal stability and good oxidation resistance. DOPO and its derivatives are often used to synthesize phosphorus-containing epoxy resins due to its structure containing an active P-H bond [38,39,40,41,42,43] (the chemical structure of some bio-based epoxy monomers containing DOPO is shown in Scheme 4). For example, Liu et al. used a simple method to synthesize a phosphorous-containing bio-based epoxy monomer of DGEBDB from vanillin and guaiacol, as shown in Scheme 4 [39]. Then, DGEBDB was mixed with petroleum-based epoxy DGEBA and cured with 4,4-diaminodiphenyl methane (DDM) to obtain cured epoxy resin. The results showed that DGEBDB and DGEBA have good compatibility, and when the weight ratio of DGEBDB and DGEBA reached 2/8, the cured epoxy resin exhibited good flame retardancy and passed the UL-94 V-0 rating, and the combustion results are summarized in Table 1. Moreover, the mechanical properties of epoxy resin after adding DGEBDB are obviously improved (Figure 1). The mechanism of DGEBDB in improving the flame retardancy of cured resin was attributed to the char layers in the condensed phase. If the DOPO-containing epoxy resin is modified with other functional groups, the epoxy resin can possess both flame retardancy and other functions. For example, Ma and co-workers synthesized two novel epoxy monomers of VAD-EP and VDP-EP from vanillin (Scheme 4) [43]. Then, two epoxy monomers were mixed in different proportions and cured with a D230 diamine curing agent to obtain epoxy resin. When the ratio of VAD-EP and VDP-EP is 8/2, the cured epoxy resin has good flame retardancy, which has passed the UL-94 V-0 test (Figure 2a1), and the combustion results are summarized in Table 1. The flame retardancy is attributed to the condensed phase and free radical capture. When the weight ratio of VAD-EP and VDP-EP is 7/3, the cured epoxy resin is not only flame-retardant but also has good self-healing and reprocessing ability (Figure 2a2,b,c), and 86.1% of the tensile strength of the material can be retained after one reprocessing. And this resin was completely degraded by stirring in 1M HCl/THF(2/8) solution at 60 °C for 1 h. The recyclability of the resin enables it to be applied to carbon-fiber-reinforced composite materials to achieve the non-destructive recovery of carbon fiber.\n\nCyclotriphosphazene-based bio-based epoxy resin. It is well known that P and N play a synergistic role in flame retardancy and have an obvious self-extinguishing effect. In addition, flame retardants containing P and N are considered environmentally friendly. Therefore, HCCP with alternating P and N in the ring structure (Scheme 3) has been extensively studied for the synthesis of flame-retardant polymers [44,45]. For example, Lei and co-workers synthesized six functional epoxy monomers of EHEP (Scheme 5) with eugenol and HCCP as raw materials, and a cured EHEP monomer with a D230 diamine hardener. The results showed that the resin of EHEP-D230 had good flame retardancy, passing the UL-94 V-0 rating, because the expanded carbon-layer structure formed during the combustion process played a role in flame retardancy and smoke suppression. In addition, EHEP-D230 has higher tensile strength (64.2 vs. 56.7 MPa) and better heat resistance (Tg = 119 vs. 85 °C) compared to the commercial epoxy of E51-D230 [44]. Soon afterward, Hu and co-workers also synthesized bio-based epoxy resin with flame-retardant properties using cardanol and HCCP as raw materials [45], and the structure of this cardanol-derived epoxy monomer of HECarCP is shown in Scheme 5, and the combustion results are summarized in Table 1.\n\nPhosphonate- and phosphate-based bio-based epoxy resin. Phosphonate- and phosphate-based epoxy monomers have been synthesized for the development of epoxy resins with inherent flame-retardant properties (the chemical structure of some phosphonate- and phosphate-based bio-based epoxy monomers is shown in Scheme 6) [46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57]. For example, Guo et al. synthesized a novel epoxy monomer named PPDEG-EP (P-E) from eugenol and phenylphosphonic dichloride, as shown in Scheme 6. And the results showed that the cured PPDEG-EP by DDM, PPDEG-EP/DDM, has a lower reaction activation energy (Ea) than commercial epoxy resin. This bio-based epoxy resin containing phosphorus could be used as a coating for wood (Figure 3), which not only retained the physical and chemical properties of commercial epoxy thermoset but also exerted flame-retardant properties [48]. In another work, Zhu et al. reported the synthesis of two epoxy monomers (EP1 and EP2, Scheme 6) from vanillin, two diamines, and diethyl phosphate. The results showed that the reactivities of these two epoxy monomers are similar to that of commercial epoxy monomers, and both the cured epoxy resins of EP1 and EP2 have flame-retardant properties (UL-94 V-0), and EP2 has higher Tg (214 vs. 166 °C), tensile strength (80.3 vs. 76.4 MPa) and tensile modulus (2709 vs. 1893 MPa) compared to those of the commercial epoxy resin [54].\n\n3.1.2. Phosphorus-Free Flame-Retardant Bio-Based Epoxy Thermosets\n\nAlthough the main components of phosphorus-free bio-based epoxy resin are C, H, O, and N, which do not contain flame-retardant elements (P, Si, etc.), the flame-retardant performance can still be endowed to the phosphorus-free bio-based epoxy resin through appropriate selection or design of biomass structure [29,31]. Some research advances about phosphorus-free flame-retardant bio-based epoxy thermosets are shown in Table 1 (blue part), and some typical examples are briefly described. The key to the flame-retardant performance of bio-based epoxy resin is to embed a special structure that produces a high char yield at high temperatures in the polymer networks. When the flame-retardant bio-based epoxy resin is heated or burned, the release of non-flammable gases (CO2, NH3, etc.) will dilute the oxygen and take away some of the heat to inhibit combustion. The dense and stable char layer formed during the combustion process acts as a barrier to heat transfer and protects the interior of the resin [29]. Biomass containing rigid and conjugated structures usually possesses a higher char yield at high temperatures [31]. According to the chemical structure, flame-retardant bio-based epoxy resins are divided into rigid/conjugated structure and heterocyclic structure, and the recent research progress is summarized and discussed, respectively.\n\nRigid and conjugated structure. Some of the bio-based epoxy monomers with a rigid and conjugated structure are directly synthesized from biomass raw materials including magnolol, resveratrol, ferulic acid, etc. [58,59,60,61,62,63,75,76,77,78,79]. The chemical structure of some representative epoxy monomers with a rigid and conjugated structure is shown in Scheme 7. Magnolol, containing symmetrical and reactive allyl groups and phenolic hydroxyl groups, is extracted from the bark of magnolia officinalis. Because of its rigid and conjugated structure, it has been used many times to synthesize flame-retardant bio-based epoxy resins [58,59,75,76]. For example, Weng et al. synthesized magnolol-derived epoxy monomer of DGEM (Scheme 7) by reacting magnolol with excessive epichlorohydrin. The cured DGEM/DDS was obtained after curing with DDS. The DGEM/DDS resin exhibited a high char yield of 42.8% and showed excellent flame-retardant performance (UL-94 V-0 rating) due to the dense and stable carbon layer produced during combustion. In addition, the resin also has a higher Tg (279 vs. 231 °C) and higher mechanical modulus and strength compared to the commercial epoxy DGEBA/DDS [58]. Moreover, the same authors also fabricated the tetra-functional epoxy monomer of MTEP derived from magnolol by successive reactions of magnolol with epichlorohydrin and epoxidation of allyl. The cured MTEP/DDS with higher cross-linking than DGEM/DDS also possessed outstanding intrinsic flame retardancy, and the combustion results are summarized in Table 1 [59]. Resveratrol with conjugated stilbene structure is extracted from grape skin, peanuts, giant knotweed, etc. There are three phenolic hydroxyl groups in the structure of resveratrol, which react with epichlorohydrin to synthesize epoxy monomer [60,78,79]. Zheng and co-workers reported a resveratrol-based epoxy resin (RESEP, Scheme 7) cured by DDM. The Tg and the char yield (800 °C) of RESEP/DDM were higher than those of DGEBA/DDM (335 °C vs. 168 °C, 38.6% vs. 16.9%). Typically, RESEP/DDM displayed a UL-94 V-0 rating [60]. Biomass that has similar conjugated structure of phenylidene to resveratrol and has been used for the synthesis of flame-retardant bio-based epoxy resins also includes ferulic acid [61], 4-coumaric acid [62], curcumin [63], and so on. Moreover, they have a lower initial degradation temperature (Table 1) due to the presence of easily broken bonds in the structure at high temperatures [61,62,63].\n\nThe direct use of biomass to prepare bio-based epoxy resin can no longer meet the material requirements, so the design of bio-based epoxy resin with good comprehensive properties through molecular modification has been widely reported. Inspired by the direct use of biomass to prepare flame-retardant bio-based epoxy, a rigid and conjugated structure plays an important role in flame retardants, so the molecular design with conjugated structure is carried out [64,65,66,80,81,82,83]. Schiff bases, which refer to compounds with the structure of R2C=NR′(R′H) formed by the addition reaction of aldehyde or ketone with primary amine, are commonly used to introduce into polymers for the preparation of flame-retardant bio-based epoxy resins. At high temperature, the internal -CH=N- bonds of the bio-based epoxy-containing imine bonds will be rearranged and cyclized, resulting in nitrogen-containing six-membered heterocyclic compounds. These heterocyclic compounds can make polymer chains self-crosslink, thus enhancing the char-forming ability of materials and improving the flame-retardant properties of materials [64,65,66,80]. For example, Weng et al. synthesized a bifunctional epoxy monomer of GV-EP (Scheme 7) containing a Schiff base using vanillin and guaiacol as raw materials. Then, GV-EP was cured with DDM to obtain the GV-EP/DDM. This epoxy resin network with a dynamic Schiff base structure (GV-EP/DDM) exhibited a higher Tg (220 vs. 187 °C) char yield (44.9% vs. 12.8% at N2 at 800 °C) and storage modulus (3602 MPa vs. 2604 MPa) than commercial bisphenol A-based epoxy resin, and possessed inherent flame-retardant properties (UL-94 V-0 rating). Furthermore, GV-EP/DDM also has satisfactory degradability, reprocessing, and antibacterial properties due to the introduction of the Schiff base structure [64].\n\nHeterocyclic structures. The most representative biomass containing a heterocyclic structure is flavonoids including daidzein, apigenin, genistein, and luteolin. Flavonoids, which contain two or more phenolic hydroxyl groups, have been directly reacted with epichlorohydrin to prepare bio-based epoxy monomers [67,68,69,84,85,86]. For example, Hu and co-workers synthesized an apigenin-based epoxy monomer (DGEA) using an efficient one-step process (Scheme 8), and cured it with DDM. The results indicated that the cured DGEA/DDM system possessed the Tg of up to 232 °C (156 °C for DGEBA/DDM), and showed higher storage modulus and tensile strength than those of cured DGEBA/DDM, which was ascribed to the high cross-link density of cured DGEA caused by the dimerization of the benzopyrone ring and the active role of intramolecular hydrogen bonds. The cured DGEA/DDM system demonstrated excellent flame-retardant properties, showing a residual char of 45.1% at 700 °C, limiting oxygen index (LOI) of 37.0%, and flammability rating of V-0 in the UL-94 test [85]. Other flavonoid-derived epoxy resins also exhibited outstanding flame-retardant properties, and the related data about their performance are summarized in Table 1. Heterocyclic structure embedding in bio-based epoxy resin through molecular modification can also be used to prepare flame-retardant bio-based epoxy resin [70,71,72,73,74,87,88,89,90,91]. Furan and its derivatives are often used to design flame-retardant bio-based epoxy resins containing a heterocyclic structure [71,87,88,89,90,91]. For example, Guo et al. designed a bis-furan diepoxide called OmbFdE (Scheme 8), which was eco-friendly. The flame retardancy of the cured OmbFdE/2,2′-(ethane-1,2-diylbis(oxy)) bis(ethan-1-amine) (TEGA) was investigated, and the results exhibited that the OmbFdE/TEGA possessed outstanding flame retardancy (Figure 4), which was attributed to a comparable lower heat release [87]. Additionally, Weng et al. synthesized an epoxy monomer of GSPZ-EP containing a heterocycle structure (Scheme 8) using biomass guaiacol and malanhydride as raw materials. After the curing process with DDM, the obtained GSPZ-EP/DDM showed higher Tg (187 vs. 173 °C), storage module (3327 ± 38 MPa vs. 1952 ± 20 MPa, at 30 °C), and char yield (42.3% vs. 17.8%, in N2 at 700 °C) compared with commercial DGEBA/DDM. Moreover, GSPZ-EP/DDM has excellent inherent flame-retardant properties, and its flame-retardant rating is close to UL-94 V-0 [72].\n\n3.2. Recyclable/Reprocessable/Degradable Bio-Based Epoxy Thermosets\n\nEpoxy resins have a lot of advantages, such as excellent mechanical properties, chemical resistance, weather resistance, good electrical insulation, and dimensional stability, so it has been widely used in composite materials [1,2,3]. However, they suffer from unsustainability because of their non-reprocessability, being difficult to recycle, and being excessively dependent on petroleum chemicals [33]. The recent development of bio-based epoxy resins containing dynamic bonds provides an alternative solution for the sustainable development of conventional petroleum-based epoxy resins, because they are not only independent of petroleum chemicals but can be reprocessed and recycled by dynamic bonds under suitable conditions [33,34,35,36]. Various dynamic bonds have been employed, such as ester bonds [92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109] and similar structures [110,111,112], Schiff bases [113,114,115,116,117,118,119,120,121,122,123,124], acetal structures [125,126,127], Diels–Alder addition structures [128,129,130,131,132,133,134], and disulfide bonds [135,136,137,138,139,140,141]. The transesterification of the ester bonds occurs easily through the breaking of C-O bonds at high temperature. In addition, hydrolysis of the ester bond can be catalyzed in an acidic or alkaline environment. Therefore, the ester bond is one of the dynamic covalent bonds usually used to prepare recyclable thermosetting resins [92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109]. The Schiff base is also one of the dynamic covalent bonds commonly used to prepare recyclable thermosetting resins. Schiff bases promote the recyclability/degradability of epoxy resin mainly through three dynamic reactions, including imine–amine exchange (transamination), imine–imine exchange (imine metathesis), and imine condensation/hydrolysis [113,114,115,116,117,118,119,120,121,122,123,124]. The acetal structure is unstable under acidic conditions and decomposes into the original aldehydes (ketones) and alcohols, thus achieving the degradability of the epoxy resin [125,126,127]. D-A reaction occurs at a lower temperature (50–80 °C) to generate a cyclohexene adduct, and the reverse reaction of the D-A reaction, retro-D-A reaction, occurs at higher temperatures (110–140 °C) to form the starting material adiene and conjugated diene. The introduction of the D-A structure into the epoxy resin makes the epoxy resin recyclable by changing the temperature [128,129,130,131,132,133,134]. The mechanical force can cause the disulfide bond to break and produce the thiol radical, which can be quickly exchanged with other disulfide bonds to achieve the reprocessability of the cross-linked network [135,136,137,138,139,140,141]. In this part, we summarize the recent progress on the design and synthesis of bio-based epoxy resins containing various dynamic bonds.\n\n3.2.1. Ester Bonds and Similar Structures\n\nEster bonds are reversible covalent bonds that are unstable under high-temperature, acidic, or alkaline conditions [92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109]. Transesterification occurs through the breaking of the C-O bond at high temperature [99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109], and the hydrolysis of ester bonds can be catalyzed in an acidic or alkaline environment [92,93,94,95,96,97,98]. Therefore, the degradation and recycling of epoxy resin can be achieved under certain conditions by introducing an ester bond structure in the molecule [92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109].\n\nFor example, Ma et al. prepared a dicarboxylic acid oligomer named MI from isosorbate and maleic anhydride by the route shown in Scheme 9, which was then used as a curing agent for epoxidized sucrose soybean meal (ESS) to obtain the thermosetting resin called EMI 1. At 50 °C, EMI 1 was stable in 1 m HCl aqueous solution; in contrast, it was degraded and completely dissolved at 12 min in 1 M NaOH aqueous solution, as shown in Figure 5. The carboxylic acid resulting from the hydrolysis of the ester bond under alkaline conditions was neutralized by the alkali to form the carboxylate, so the epoxy resin containing the ester bond has better degradability under the catalysis of the base. In the cured epoxy resin, the hydroxyl group produced by the ring-opening reaction can undergo a dynamic transesterification reaction with the ester bond at high temperature (>150 °C), which makes the material repairable and reprocessable [96]. In addition, excessive zinc salts are usually used to catalyze transesterification in industry [99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106]. For example, Liu et al. synthesized a bio-based triepoxy called TEP from vanillin and guaiacol, and the cured TEP by an anhydride exhibited high performance and rapid self-healing capability through dynamic transesterification. The width of the crack from cured TEP can be effectively repaired within 10 min without pressure (Figure 6). It is worth noting that a zinc catalyst was chosen to catalyze the curing reaction and also used as the catalyst for transesterification in the cured TEP (Scheme 10) [100].\n\nIf the cured epoxy material structure contains tertiary amines, the transesterification reaction can be performed without a metal catalyst, and the recycle reaction can also occur under mild conditions [107,108,109]. For example, Chen and co-workers prepared a bio-based epoxy resin of epoxidized menthane diamine–adipic acid (EMDA-AA, Scheme 11) containing ester bonds from menthane diamine and adipic acid biomass. The EMDA-AA resin can be rearranged in the network structure by the dynamic transesterification reaction without additional catalyst (Scheme 11). And the EMDA-AA matrix in the composite material can be degraded into polyols by amination reactions under mild conditions, and realize the recycling of fibers [107].\n\nThe borate ester bond (B-O-C), as a dynamic reversible chemical bond, has similar properties to the ester bond. On the one hand, the boron ester, performing an associative transesterification reaction in the permanent cross-linked network, enables the rearrangement of the network that contributed to the reprocessing of cured resins in the solid state. On the other hand, borate ester bonds are sensitive to reactive oxygen species, and in acidic media with pH much lower than its pKa, borate ester bonds are more easily hydrolyzed into boric acids and diols, which is conducive to the recycling of resins containing borate ester bonds [110,111,112]. Therefore, the boron ester bond provides a path for designing recyclable/reprocessable/degradable bio-based epoxy resin.\n\nFor example, Zeng et al. fabricated a bio-based epoxy vitrimer called C-FPAE, containing dynamic reversible boronic ester bonds using rosin derivative (FPAE) as an epoxy monomer and 2,2′-(1,4-phenylene)-bis(4-mercaptan-1,3,2-dioxaborolane) (BDB) as a hardener (Scheme 12) [110]. The C-FPAE has superior thermostability and thermomechanical properties due to the presence of the structure of the rosin derivative, enhanced covalent cross-linker, and the hydrogen bond in the networks (Scheme 12). Moreover, C-FPAE possesses recyclable and self-healing properties through the transesterification reaction of boron ester bonds in the network structure (Figure 7a). For example, a 20% C-FPEA (x% C-FPAE refers to cured FPAE with x mol% of BDB) sheet sample with a thickness of 0.7 mm was cut into a width of 117 μm. The cut samples were healed at 170 °C in an oven for 30 min. As shown in Figure 7b, the cut 20% of C-FPEA samples achieved 80% recovery after healing treatment, showing good self-healing ability. And the 20% C-FPAE solid was ground into powder and hot-pressed at 200 °C for 60 min to obtain a uniform sample, exhibiting good reprocessing properties (Figure 7c). In addition, C-FPEA samples can also be degraded in active oxygen and acidic conditions. At 30 °C, 20% C-FPAE powder samples were soaked in THF/H2O2/HCI mixture with different pH and stirred for 48 h. As pH decreases from 6.5 to 0.0, the degradation weight percentage increases from 10% to 90%, and the degradation mechanism is shown in Scheme 13. It follows that C-FPAE samples are more easily degraded in strong acid solution [110].\n\nSimilarly, Zhang et al. also utilized BDB as a curing agent to cure the cardanol-derived epoxy monomer of EHCPP (the synthetic route and structure of EHCPP are shown in Scheme 14) to prepare EHCPP-BDB epoxy polymer networks containing borate ester bonds [112]. EHCPP-BDB polymer was cut into small pieces and then placed into the mold and remolded to new samples by hot-pressing at 150 °C under a pressure of 10 MPa for 10 min, and the EHCPP-BDB was remolded to form a continuous and uniform sample (Figure 8b), and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) studies showed that the original and remolded samples had a similar Tg and storage moduli (at 25 °C), exhibiting excellent reprocessability (Figure 8a). The reversible mechanism of boron ester in the cardanol-based epoxy polymer network is shown in Figure 8c. In addition, immersing the EHCPP-BDB polymer in 10% NaOH resulted in a 30% increase in the weight of the network. This is because the dynamically reversible boron oxygen bond is hydrolyzed into boric acid in an aqueous solution, which then forms borate in the presence of sodium hydroxide.\n\n3.2.2. Schiff Bases\n\nA Schiff base refers to a compound with the structure of R2C=NR′(R′H) formed by the reaction between an aldehyde and amine group. A Schiff base provides a promising process for the design of recyclable/degradable bio-based epoxy resins due to its three dynamic reactions, including imine–amine exchange (transamination), imine–imine exchange (imine metathesis), and imine condensation/hydrolysis [113,114,115,116,117,118,119,120,121,122,123,124]. Unlike transesterification, there is no need for metal catalysts during reprocessing, reducing the complexity of the reprocessing process. For example, M. Abu-Omar et al. synthesized the imine-embedded bisphenol intermediate of VAN-AP used to prepare the epoxy monomer (GE-VAN-AP) from vanillin and aminophenol (Scheme 15a) [116]. The cured epoxy thermosetting resin with diamine can be soluble in water or organic solvents under mild conditions (Figure 9A), which is conducive to achieving molecular closed-loop recyclability, and the recycled resin can maintain the original properties, and the dissociative mechanism is shown in Scheme 15b. Through the imine–amine exchange mechanism (Scheme 15c), the cured GE-VAN-AP is weldable and repairable at a sufficient temperature, as shown in Figure 9B. In addition, the cured resin has properties comparable to conventional high-performance thermosetting materials made of bisphenol A.\n\nEpoxy curing agents containing a Schiff base structure can also be utilized to prepare polymer network structures with recyclable properties [119,120]. For example, Zeng and co-workers also synthesized VAN-AP and acted as a curing agent for glycerol triglycidyl ether (Gte) to form a polymer network structure (Gte-VA) embedded in the Schiff base structure [119]. The Young’s modulus and tensile strength of the Get-VA polymer network structure are close to the value of the amine-cured bisphenol A diglycidyl ether. The Get-VA polymer network structure has good degradation properties and reprocessing ability due to the embedding of Schiff base structures (Figure 10). In addition, Get-VA can also be used in the matrix of carbon fiber (CF) composite material. The carbon fiber in the composite material can be recycled without damage, and the recombination of the recycled carbon fiber and the degraded resin matrix has similar properties to the original composite material (Figure 11).\n\nThe introduction of Schiff base into polymer networks not only solves the degradability of bio-based epoxy but also improves the mechanical properties. And the Schiff base structure can be formed in situ between the epoxy monomer and the curing agent during curing. For example, Liu et al. also synthesized an epoxy monomer of DADE containing an aldehyde group from vanillin and cured it with a curing agent containing two primary amines group (D230) to form a polymer network (DADE-D230) containing Schiff base structure in situ (Scheme 16) [121]. This polymer network has a higher Tg (106 °C) and tensile strength (57.4 MPa) than the bisphenol A-based epoxy resin (98 °C, 45.1 MPa). The shattered polymer was remodeled after hot pressing at 150 °C for 10 min (Figure 12), and the reprocessed sample has comparable properties with the conventional bisphenol A-based epoxy resin. And the mechanisms involved in the reprocessing process are illustrated in Figure 12, including imine-amine exchange (via the excess amine in the network) and imine-imine exchange.\n\nIn addition, the introduction of Schiff base structures usually functionalizes polymer materials, such as flame-retardant and antibacterial properties [122,123,124]. At high temperature, the internal -CH=N- bonds of the bio-based epoxy-containing imine bonds will be rearranged and cyclized, resulting in nitrogen-containing six-membered heterocyclic compounds [71,90,91]. These heterocyclic compounds can make polymer chains self-crosslink, thus enhancing the char-forming ability of materials and improving the flame-retardant properties of materials. It provides a new possibility for degradable and flame-retardant epoxy resin. This category is described in detail in the antibacterial and flame-retardant functionalization Section.\n\n3.2.3. Acetal Structure\n\nAldehydes or ketones react with polyols under acidic conditions to form an acetal structure that is stable under alkaline conditions, but decomposes into the original aldehydes (ketones) and alcohols under acidic conditions. Therefore, the introduction of acetal structure into the epoxy resin network makes the epoxy resin degradable [125,126,127]. Moreover, the resin introducing this structure has excellent thermal and mechanical properties due to the high rigidity of the acetal structure.\n\nFor example, Songqi Ma et al. used the spiro diacetal structure to prepare recyclable high-performance bio-based epoxy resin from vanillin. The synthetic route is shown in Scheme 17 [126]. The related epoxy resin cured with isophorondiamine exhibited outstanding degradability. As shown in Figure 13, the epoxy resin can be completely dissolved in 1 M HCl (acetone/H2O = 9/1, v/v) solution within 183 min at 23 °C. At 50 °C, the degradation time is reduced to 19 min, and the degradation time can be achieved in 11 min and 9 min, respectively, in solutions with concentrations of 0.5 M and 1 M HCl. The tensile strength of the vanillin-based CF composite is 731 MPa, while that of the BPA-based CF composite is 661 MPa. It is worth noting that the resin in the vanillin-based epoxy matrix composite can be completely dissolved in the 1 M HCl solution within 30 min, and maintain its carbon fiber properties. Similarly, the same authors synthesized a bisphenol of HMDO containing acetal from natural resources of vanillin and glycerol through solvent-free acetalization as in Scheme 18 [127]. HMDO can be degraded to non-toxic vanillin and glycerol very quickly under mildly acidic conditions similar to the acidity and temperature of human gastric juice in the human stomach (Scheme 19). Therefore, the obtained epoxy resins possess outstanding degradability, which facilitates the recyclability of the epoxy resin. An epoxy thermoset of DGHMDO-DDM sample with dimensions of 8 mm × 8 mm × 1 mm was completely degraded after being immersed in 0.1 M HCl acetone/water (9/1, v/v) solution at 50 °C for 5.5 h (Figure 14). In addition, compared to the commercial counterpart based on bisphenol A (BPA), DGHMDO-DDM showed higher mechanical properties and comparable thermal properties.\n\n3.2.4. Diels–Alder Addition Structures\n\nThe D-A reaction (Diels–Alder reaction) occurs between an electron-rich conjugated diene and an electron-poor electrophilic diene, generating a cyclohexene adduct through a [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction that occurs at a lower temperature (50–80 °C) and has the advantage of mild reaction conditions, catalyst-free requirement, and producing no byproducts in the reaction. The reverse reaction of the D-A reaction, retro-D-A reaction, occurs at higher temperatures (110–140 °C) to form the starting material adiene and conjugated diene [128,129,130,131,132,133,134]. Therefore, the introduction of the D-A addition structures into the thermosetting resin gives the material the self-healing and recyclable ability to make it sustainable. Furan derivatives and dimaleimide are often used as electron-rich and electron-poor feedstocks, respectively, in the design of bio-based thermosetting resins containing D-A structures. For example, Liu et al. Liu et al. prepared compounds containing D-A structures from furan and bismaleimide and grafted them onto a commercial epoxy monomer (as shown in Scheme 20) [131]. The results showed that the cured epoxy resin can completely self-heal its cracks. The resin is combined with unidirectional fiberglass cloth to form a fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) material. Under the appropriate temperature stimulation, the resin matrix of FRP can also completely self-heal the crack through the dissociation and reassociation of D-A bonds (Scheme 21), and the mechanical properties of FRP after two self-healing are close to that of the original composite material. Therefore, the introduction of the D-A bond into polymer networks is a promising route for synthesizing epoxy resin with self-healing and recyclable properties.\n\n3.2.5. Disulfide Bonds\n\nThe dynamic reaction of disulfide bonds involves multiple mechanisms. When the external force mechanically breaks the disulfide bond and produces the thiol radical, which can quickly exchange with other disulfide bonds, it achieves the self-healing ability and reprocessability of the cross-linked network. The dissociation nature of the disulfide bond provides a new solution for the degradation of the epoxy resin under reducing or alkaline conditions. Using dynamic disulfide bonds, many polymers with reprocessable and degradable properties have been synthesized and reported [135,136,137,138,139,140,141]. Wang et al. used traditional aromatic diamine and structurally similar aromatic diamine containing dynamic disulfide bonds as curing agents, respectively, to cure isosorbide-derived epoxy monomers to form polymer networks. Experimental studies showed that the epoxy resin-containing dynamic disulfide bond (MDS-EPO) exhibited comparable thermomechanical properties to the epoxy resin cured by the traditional curing agent (MDA-EPO). The cracked MDS-EPO was heated at 100 °C, above its Tg, the crack gradually disappeared, and the crack was completely repaired after heating for 60 min (Figure 15a). The MDS-EPO broken into a powder can also be reprocessed into a uniform and transparent film at 100 °C for 60 min (Figure 15b). Moreover, the sample after one cycle of reprocessing has similar mechanical properties to the original sample, and the recovery efficiency of mechanical properties after the two and three cycles of reprocessing remained more than 80% (Figure 15c,d). The contrast of MDA-EPO broken into a powder had only physical adhesion without mechanical properties under the same thermal pressure conditions (Figure 15b) [138].\n\nThe self-healing and reprocessing of the polymer networks containing a dynamic bond are generally slow, and the synergetic incorporation of multiple dynamic bonds can accelerate the stress relaxation of the polymer chains, enabling the polymer chains to complete the self-heal quickly at a moderate temperature at short period [139,140,141]. For example, Wang and co-workers used BDB as a curing agent to cure epoxidized soybean oil (ESO), epoxidized linseed oil (ELO), epoxidized rubber seed oil (ERSO), and epoxidized olive oil (EOO), respectively, to prepare bio-based epoxy resin, which contains three dynamic bonds including borate ester bond, ester bonds, and disulfide bonds (Scheme 22) [139]. These samples were cut into small pieces and remolded by hot-pressing at 160 °C and 40 MPa for 20 min to obtain the reprocessed samples, which maintain the original integrity and color (Figure 16), and the mechanical properties of the recycled samples are maintained even after nine times of cutting/recycling (Figure 16). These samples also have good self-healing properties. In addition, the introduction of a tricyclic dioxaborolane rigid structure improves the mechanical properties of vegetable oil-based epoxy resins, and the introduction of dynamic bonds gives the polymer self-healing and reprocessing properties. This example opens a new dimension to the tuning of polymer performance through multiple dynamic bonds.\n\n3.3. Shape Memory\n\nShape memory polymers (SMPs) are materials that can be deformed into their shape under a certain condition (usually with external mechanical stress), and can recover to their permanent shape by applying external stimuli. Bio-based SMPs are primarily thermo-responsive, and their shape change is generally achieved by thermal stimulation [142,143,144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153,154] and they possess a transition temperature. Above the transition temperature, chain migration is activated and deformation occurs under external stress. Upon cooling with the load, the shape of the deformation is fixed. When heated to above transition temperature, it can be recovered to a permanent shape due to the entropy nature of the shape change. Because the long and flexible fat chain contributes to the chain segment migration, bio-based SMPs are typically made from bio-based feedstocks that contain flexible structures, such as vegetable oil, jatropha oil, and castor oil. For example, Aung and co-workers prepared epoxy polymers (SMPs) from jatropha oil (Scheme 23), which are in a thermally stable state at 150 °C. Above the Tg temperature, the polymers are in a rubbery state that is easily deformed, and they can return to their original shapes after cooling, and they have a good ability to recover their shapes (Figure 17) [145]. Cardanol is also often used in the preparation of bio-based epoxy polymers with shape memory due to its internal phenolic hydroxyl group, C=C carbon bonds, and long alkyl chain structure. Wang and co-workers synthesized two cardanol-derived curing agents (Car-DCP-MAH and Car-DPC-MAH, Scheme 24) and used them to cure DGEBA. The DGEBA/Car-DCP-MAH and DGEBA/Car-DPC-MAH epoxy thermosets not only have good shape memory (shape recovery efficiency of 98.6% and 96.3%, respectively), but also have high flame retardancy (LOI values of 29% and 28%, respectively, and a flame-retardant rating of V-0) [146].\n\nThermal stimulation can be achieved not only by direct heating but also indirectly by light-converted heat [148,149]. The traditional photo-responsive materials are realized by doping photothermal fillers, such as black pigment, graphene, and nanosilver. However, photothermal fillers can aggregate in polymers and reduce the mechanical properties of the materials [149]. Therefore, finding photothermal groups from bio-based feedstocks and introducing them into the epoxy polymer network can improve this defect very well. A commonly used bio-based raw material is furfural [148,149]. For example, Rimdusit et al. reported epoxy polymers with near-infrared light-responsive shape memory function but without any photothermal fillers in the material [148]. A benzoxazine/epoxy copolymer (V-fa/ECO) with shape memory ability was made from furfurylamine. Within 30 s of near-infrared irradiation (laser power density of 2.5 W/cm2), the temperature of the copolymer increased from room temperature to 100 °C, resulting in a photothermal effect inducing shape recovery (Figure 18). This is due to the highly conjugated π-bonds in the furfuryl amine, which endow the furfural-based materials with excellent light absorption [148]. In addition, the aldehyde group in furfural is easily oxidized and exhibits a dark brown color making it a good light absorber [149].\n\nHowever, all of these materials above can only hold a single permanent shape and cannot be reconfigured once formed. The introduction of dynamic covalent bonds enables the bio-based shape memory thermosetting network to be topologically arranged through the exchange of dynamic bonds, and the permanent shape of the material can be further reconfigured [150,151,152,153]. Other than the transition temperature, the SMPs with reconfigured permanent shapes possess the topology freezing transition temperature, above which the dynamic covalent bonds are activated and the networks are topologically arranged through bond exchange, forming new permanent shapes. In addition, the introduction of dynamic bonds also provides a new idea for the development of recyclable and repairable shape memory epoxy polymers. The dynamic bonds commonly introduced are the Diels–Alder bond, disulfide bond, and ester bond [134,150,151,152,153]. For example, Xu and co-workers used ESO and rosin derivative fumarhippoic acid (FPA) as raw materials to synthesize a new fully bio-based vitrimer (ESO-FPA) with Tg higher than room temperature (Figure 19A). This polymer network can realize heat-induced triple-shape memory well (Figure 19B). Firstly, the shape memory of the ESO-FPA vitrimer based on the transition temperature was confirmed, as shown in Figure 19B. In an oven at 80 °C, the permanent rectangular sample was heated under external force so that it took a temporary “N” shape, which then was cooled and fixed. The temporary “N”-shaped sample can be recovered to its original permanent shape when heated at 80 °C. Then, the shape memory of the ESO-FPA vitrimer based on the transesterification was explored, as shown in Figure 19B. The permanent rectangular sample was heated at 160 °C (above the topology freezing transition temperature) under an external force to achieve a deformed “N” shape, which then was cooled and fixed. The deformed “N” as a new permanent shape is then deformed again at 80 °C under external stress, forming a temporary helical shape and being fixed. Since 80 °C is higher than the transition temperature and lower than the topology freezing transition temperature, the formation of temporary helical shapes was achieved through molecular chain movement. The temporary helical-shaped sample can be recovered to the new permanent “N” shape when heated at 80 °C. Finally, when heated to 160 °C, the ESO-FPA vitrimer with the “N” shape returned to its original permanent rectangular shape under extra stress. In addition, this new fully bio-based vitrimer also has good self-healing and reprocessability due to transesterification reaction [151]. Similarly, Cheng and co-workers prepared a novel bio-based recyclable phase change material (PCM) denoted as DGEM-18/FA/MA/xBW, which is a reversible cross-linked network based on epoxide ring-opening and Diels-Alder reactions. The D-A and retro-D-A reactions confer excellent triple-shape memory to the material and also provide the recyclability of the cross-linking networks [134]. Moreover, Kim et al. prepared a new type of sustainable thermosetting material using naringenin [152]. Then, it was cured by oxidized poly(ethylene glycol)-acid with functional groups of carboxylic acid to produce an epoxy network (Figure 20A). Transesterification in the network not only gives the material recyclability, but also realizes its heat-induced shape memory function. In addition, the shape change can be driven by water, and its coiled shape can be programmed on the Tg, deformed after wetting, and restored to the initial state after short drying, realizing the dual-response shape memory of heat and water (Figure 20B) [152]. Further, the synergistic effect of multiple dynamic covalent bonds also provides a new way to prepare bio-based and shape memory epoxy resins with reprocessability, repairability, and recyclability. Mija et al. prepared epoxy thermosetting resin with dynamic disulfide covalent bonds and transesterification synergies using 2,2′-dithiobenzoic acid as a hardener. The obtained epoxy thermosetting has excellent shape memory ability, and the synergistic effect of internal covalent bonds ensures the reprocessability, repairability, and recyclability of the material [153]. This provides a new experience for sustainable epoxy thermosetting materials with shape memory.\n\n3.4. Antibacterial\n\nAntibacterial materials usually achieve their bactericidal effect through the release of antibacterial components such as metal nanoparticles, antibiotics, and other biocides, loaded or embedded in the resin matrix. However, with the consumption of biocides, the antibacterial effect gradually disappears, making it difficult to maintain a long-lasting bactericidal effect [36,155,156,157,158,159,160,161,162,163,164]. By directly functionalizing the biocidal units into the molecular chains, a longer-lasting antibacterial effect can be achieved [156,157,158,159,160]. For example, phenolic compounds (magnolol, eugenol, vanillin, protocatechuic acid, etc.) have natural antibacterial activities and are often used as raw materials for antibacterial materials [157,158,159,160]. They act on bacterial cells through various mechanisms, such as interacting with protein and bacterial cell walls, changing the membrane permeability, inhibiting the synthesis of nucleic acid, or damaging DNA [161]. On the one hand, antibacterial units can be functionalized into the main chain. Magnolol, as a natural product containing both phenolic and allylic groups, has strong antibacterial activity. Cao et al. synthesized a bio-based epoxy monomer (MGOL-EP) from natural magnolol (Figure 21a). A fully bio-based and high-performance epoxy thermosetting resin (MGOL-EP-SC) was obtained by self-curing, and its killing rate against S. aureus reached 48.4% (Figure 21b,c). The antibacterial property was attributed to the mechanism that MGOL-EP-SC resin can damage the cell walls, causing increased membrane permeability, leakage of cell components, and inhibition of S. aureus growth [157]. On the other hand, antibacterial units can also be functionalized into the side chains [158,159,160]. For example, Modjinou et al. designed an epoxidized eugenol network with antioxidant and antibacterial properties using eugenol derivative (named epoxy eugenol, EE), and the combination of eugenol derivative with a phenolic group and the addition of 70 wt% eugenol derivative can reduce the bacterial adhesion of both S. aureus and E. coli by more than 90% [159].\n\nIn addition, new antibacterial groups can be designed by modifying bio-based monomers. The most studied are Schiff bases formed by aldehydes/ketones reacting with amines (imine bonds and hydrazone bonds) [155,162,163,164,165]. The antibacterial mechanism of Schiff bases may be related to the free electrons in the nitrogen atoms, which facilitates the antibacterial material to easily interact with the bacteria cell wall/membrane [166]. Tang et al. prepared a bio-based thermosetting material with high performance, high flame retardancy (limiting oxygen index 33.8%, UL-94 V-0 rating), and antibacterial properties. The Schiff bases in the network provided 100% intrinsic antibacterial efficiency of epoxy resin, and it had good antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus. It is satisfactory that this material also has good reprocessability and degradability due to the embedding of a Schiff base structure [163]. However, fully bio-based epoxy materials with simultaneously high mechanical, thermal, and antibacterial properties have been rarely reported. Hu and co-workers obtained a fully bio-based epoxy thermosetting resin (SA-GA-EP/DIFFA) from syringaldehyde-derived epoxy monomer containing a Schiff base and curing agent of DIFFA synthesized from furylamine (Scheme 25) [155]. Because of the Schiff base structure, SA-GA-EP/DIFFA not only has good antibacterial activity against Gram-positive S. aureus (Figure 22), but also has a high Tg up to 204 °C, a flame-retardant rating of UL-94 V-0, and a high limiting oxygen index (LOI) up to 40.0%, which provides a new research avenue for the fully bio-based epoxy thermosets to become high-performance and antibacterial materials [155].\n\nIn order to assess the practical viability and competitiveness of bio-based alternatives in real applications. SA-GA-EP/DIFFA, MGOL-EP-SC, and MGOL-EP/DDM are taken as typical representatives, and their mechanical properties, thermal stability, antibacterial, and flame-retardant properties are summarized in Table 2 to compare with that of petroleum-based epoxy resin. It can be seen from Table 2 that the comprehensive performance of the SA-GA-EP/DIFFA, MGOL-EP-SC, and MGOL-EP/DDM is better than that of petroleum-based epoxy resins, so they are promising substitutes for a DGEBA-based thermoset in high-performance fire safe applications.\n\nThe manufacture of epoxy resin with flame retardancy, antibacterial properties, degradability, and high mechanical properties is difficult due to the contradiction between the high cross-linking densities required for high-performance and flame retardancy, and the mild and dynamic reversible conditions for reprocessability and degradability. Liu and coworkers prepared a bio-based epoxy resin (HVPA/GDE) by curing the bio-based epoxy of glycerol diglycidyl ether (GDE) with a novel vanillin-derived curing agent (HVPA)-containing Schiff base (Scheme 26). Due to the uniform distribution of dynamic imine bonds in each cross-linking bond, the material not only has excellent flame retardancy (LOI value of about 28.6%, UL-94 V-0 grade) and recyclability, but also the calculated kill rate of both Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus is about 100% (Figure 23). In addition, HVPA/GDE has comparable mechanical properties to the epoxy resin formed by curing GDE with a DDM curing agent. This gives the epoxy resin an excellent balance of fast self-healing (100% within 8 min, no pressure), good shape memory, easy reprocessing (1.5 MPa, 3 min, 100 °C), mild degradation (acid hydrolysis), bacterial resistance, and acceptable mechanical properties [164]. Furthermore, the hydrazone group as an important Schiff base structure also has a good antibacterial effect. Xu et al. synthesized dihydrazone-containing epoxide monomers (HBE, Scheme 27) by condensation of vanillin and hydrazine hydrate, and prepared a novel dihydrazone-based covalent network by cross-linking. Due to the hydrazone bond and methoxy on vanillin, the killing rate of E. coli was as high as 95.8% (Figure 24A), and the dihydrazone covalent network still showed excellent stability and hydrazone exchange at about 100 °C, which gave it excellent mechanical properties and recyclability (Figure 24B) [165].\n\n4. Conclusions, Challenges, and Opportunities\n\nThe raw material of bio-based epoxy resin is natural biomass, which has the advantages of being sustainable and environmentally friendly and is the most promising substitute for petroleum resources for the preparation of bio-based epoxy resin. Bio-based epoxy resins with different functions have their own structural characteristics. In this review, functional bio-based epoxy resins are classified according to their structural characteristics, and their synthesis is discussed. For example, the synthesis of flame-retardant epoxy resins is usually achieved by introducing flame-retardant elements (P, Si, etc.), or rigid and conjugated structures. For the preparation of recyclable/degradable/processable bio-based epoxy resins, dynamic covalent bonds including ester bonds, disulfide bonds, Schiff base structures, D-A addition structures, and acetal structures are usually introduced into the polymer networks. Moreover, the introduction of these dynamic covalent bonds is often used in the preparation of epoxy resins with shape memory. And the design of antibacterial bio-based epoxy resins is usually realized by introducing antibacterial units such as hydroxyl, Schiff base, and long alkyl chains. Then, the relationship between structure and performance was summarized and revealed. The purpose of this review is to provide guidelines for the synthesis of functional bio-based epoxy resins and stimulate the development of more types of functional bio-based epoxy resins. However, due to the different chemical reactions that can occur for biomass raw materials with different structures, a unified design and synthesis method cannot be given.\n\nFunctional bio-based epoxy resins improve their competitiveness because of their unique properties, but there are still many problems to be solved. For example, biomass feedstock has the characteristics of higher cost and smaller production scale. How to improve the separation and purification technology of biomass and synthesize bio-based epoxy resin with high purity and economic efficiency is a problem that needs to be solved at present. In addition, most bio-based epoxy monomers are solid, and are more difficult to process than DGEBA. For bio-based epoxy resins with recyclable/degradable/reprocessable properties or shape memory ability, mechanical properties are often deteriorated by the introduction of dynamic covalent bonds or flexible long chains. Therefore, seeking the balance between mechanical properties and functional properties is a problem that needs to be considered comprehensively in design and synthesis. However, flame-retardant epoxy resins containing aromatic rings with a high char yield usually have brittle lack. In addition, it should also be noted that high temperature may cause functional disappearance during processing. Multifunctional bio-based epoxy resins should be developed, and this review also lists several bio-based epoxy resins that are both flame-retardant and antibacterial, or both flame-retardant and recyclable. Furthermore, more new kinds of functions need to be developed to meet the needs of practical applications. And further research is necessary to determine how to increase the bio-based content of epoxy resins.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceptualization, Y.Z.

In this work, we proposed the introduction of cyanide structure groups into the molecular structure of epoxy resins to give them excellent heat resistance. A eugenol-based epoxy-phthalonitrile (EEPN) resin was synthesized by a two-step process using the bio-based renewable resource of eugenol, and a series of EEPN/Epoxide resin (E51) blend resins with different EEPN contents were prepared. The structure of the EEPN monomer was characterized and confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and elemental analysis. The thermal stability and dynamic mechanical properties of the cured resins were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis. The experimental results showed that EEPN had excellent heat resistance; the char yield at 800 °C was 67.9 wt%, which was much higher than that of E51 at 26.3 wt%; and the heat resistance of the blended resins was significantly improved with the increase in the EEPN content.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThermosetting resins are widely used in aerospace and marine applications due to their high glass transition temperature (Tg), long-term thermal stability, good mechanical properties, and excellent processability. Common thermosetting resins include epoxy and unsaturated polyester resins, bismaleimide, thermoset polyimide, and phthalonitrile (PN), and most of their raw materials come from non-renewable resources [1]. With the growing demand for petroleum products and their increasing negative impact on the environment, polymeric materials from renewable resource sources have received much attention. Studies have shown that bio-based polymers from renewable resources usually have comparable or superior performance characteristics to those of conventional polymeric materials. Therefore, these environmentally friendly polymeric materials are expected to replace petroleum-derived feedstocks, helping to reduce carbon emissions and conserve limited petroleum resources [2,3].\n\nAs one of the three major thermosetting resins, epoxy resins (EPs) are widely used in adhesives [4], coatings [5], and high-performance composite matrices [6] due to their high mechanical properties, low curing shrinkage, excellent chemical resistance, and good processability. Nowadays, epoxy resins account for about 70% of the thermoset materials market, of which bisphenol A diglyceryl ether (DGEBA) accounts for about 90% of the global production of epoxy resins, but the use of bisphenol A, the most important raw material, has been restricted in numerous countries and fields due to its biologically low toxicity [7,8]. Therefore, the study of bio-based epoxy resins based on renewable resources is of great environmental and strategic significance to achieve the green and sustainable development of polymer materials. The excellent performance of cured DGEBA is attributed to the rigid structure of its benzene ring. Therefore, bio-based phenols with rigid structural benzene rings have been widely studied as phenolic sources for the synthesis of epoxy resins, such as cashew nut phenol [9,10,11], luteolin [12], 2,5-furofuran carboxylic acid (FDCA) [13,14], magnolol [15], lignin [16,17,18,19], sorbitol [20], isosorbide [21,22], cellulose [23], etc., which have been used for the synthesis of bio-based epoxy resins. Among the many substances that can be used as bio-based feedstocks, eugenol and its derivatives are widely used in the development of high-performance resins such as epoxy derivatives, benzoxazine resins, and bismaleimide resins, due to their compact structures and multifunctional groups [21] (hydroxyl and allyl), as well as their renewability [24] and low toxicity [25], which can be produced from plant sources, and in the design of various functional polymers [26,27,28,29]. Wang et al. [30] prepared a series of multifunctional bio-based epoxy resin precursor TEU-EPs based on eugenol, and the cured product of TEU-EP/DDS had a Tg as high as 207 °C, which had more excellent thermodynamic properties compared with the traditional bisphenol A-based epoxy resin. Miao et al. [28] designed and synthesized a kind of eugenol containing furan ring-based epoxy resin precursor EUFU-EP and used methylhexahydrophthalic anhydride (MHHPA) as the curing agent. The Tg of the EUFU-EP/MHHPA was slightly higher than that of the DGEBA/MHHPA compared with the conventional DGEBA epoxy resin. This is attributed to the unique molecular structure of EUFU-EP. The EUFU-EP/MHHPA also has higher flexural modulus, storage modulus, and flame retardancy.\n\nFurthermore, epoxy resins, as one of the most widely used polymer materials in the industrial field, have high requirements in terms of heat resistance in special areas such as aerospace and aviation [31]. Therefore, the study of bio-based thermosetting resins with good heat resistance is of great significance and is in line with the trend of continuous development of polymer materials. Phthalonitrile (PN) resin, a compound first synthesized by Keller’s research group in the 1970s, has attracted great attention internationally due to its excellent thermo-oxidative stability and flame retardancy and the absence of small molecules in curing [32,33,34], and it has attracted more and more attention in the application fields of aerospace, electronic encapsulation, and flame-retardant materials [35,36]. In addition, PN is the only resin that meets the U.S. Navy flame standard (MIL-STD-2031) [37,38]. Ning et al. [39] synthesized a novel bio-based PN resin (MEG-PN) based on eugenol derivatives. The main advantages of MEG-PN resin over PN resin are the lower curing temperature (281 °C) and excellent processability. The cured MEG-PN resin showed excellent heat resistance at 448 °C, and its char yield at 800 °C was as high as 75.6%. Sun et al. [40] synthesized two phthalonitrile resins (VPN and IVPN) containing spirocyclic acetal structures by a two-step method using pentaerythritol and renewable vanillin and isovanillin as raw materials. Compared with traditional petroleum-based phthalonitrile resins such as bisphenol A, the cured VPN and IVPN resins have good thermal stability and thermo-mechanical properties, high glass transition temperature (Tg), and excellent processing properties. Wang et al. [41] synthesized two bio-based phthalonitriles (EPN and GPN) based on the reaction of eugenol with lignin derivatives and 4-nitro phthalonitrile, respectively. Their glass transition temperatures were characterized by DSC and DMA tests as 394 °C and 392 °C, respectively, and the char yield of both EPN and GPN was greater than 70% at 800 °C.\n\nIn summary, based on the bio-renewable properties of eugenol and the excellent thermo-oxidative stability of PN resins, in this paper, eugenol-based phthalonitrile monomer (EPN) was first prepared from eugenol, o-phenyl 4-nitrophthalonitrile, and potassium carbonate, and then EPN was reacted with 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid to generate a eugenol-based epoxy-phthalonitrile monomer (EEPN), as shown in Scheme 1. The EEPN was blended with epoxy resin E51. The curing process, curing mechanism, and curing kinetics of EEPN were investigated, and the thermal stability and the dynamic mechanical properties of EEPN and the blended resin were studied.\n\n2. Results and Discussion\n\n2.1. Characterization of EEPN\n\nFigure 1 shows the infrared spectra of eugenol-based epoxy-phthalonitrile monomer (EEPN) compared with EPN. From Figure 1, one can observe the disappearance of the allylic stretching vibration peak at 1633 cm−1 and the appearance of the asymmetric ring stretching vibration peak of the epoxide ring at 935 cm−1, as well as the appearance of the stretching vibration peak of the epoxide ring C–H near 3038 cm−1. Thus, it can be indicated that EEPN was successfully synthesized.\n\nFigure 2a shows the 1H NMR spectra of EEPN, which has 10 different chemical shifts of H. From Figure 2, it can be seen that δ = 3.32 ppm is the characteristic absorption peak of H on H2O, and 2.50 ppm is the characteristic absorption peak of H on the deuterium-substituted solvent, DMSO. The values δ = 2.62 ppm, δ = 3.20 ppm, and δ = 2.86 ppm are the characteristic peaks on the epoxy groups Ha, Hb, and Hc, respectively; the three hydrogen protons in the methoxy OCH3 are Hf with a chemical shift of δ = 3.74 ppm; and their integral area ratios are in accordance with the theoretical ratio of 2:1:2:3. The benzene ring structure is a spatially asymmetric three-dimensional structure, so its hydrogen atoms are in different chemical environments, and the aromatic protons of the spectra are confirmed at 6.97–8.04 ppm. We zoomed in the range of 6.97–8.04 ppm. From Figure 2b, it can be seen that He and Hj are coupled to each other and split into double peaks. At the same time, He is coupled by the interstitial Hd, and there is a secondary split peak. To better show the peaks out of Hj and Hd, we zoomed in on this part, as shown by the small red peaks in Figure 2b. Hh is coupled by the neighboring Hi and splits into double peaks, and at the same time, it is coupled by the smaller interstitial of Hg and finally shows the morphology of the approximate quadruple peaks. There is also a case of such a mutual coupling between Hg and Hi, and so there is a double peak. The details are as follows: Hd (s, δ = 7.16 ppm), He (d, δ = 6.88–6.86 ppm), Hg (s, δ = 7.69 ppm), Hh (dd, δ = 7.21–7.19 ppm), Hi (d, δ = 8.04–8.02 ppm), and Hj (d, δ = 7.18–7.17 ppm), and the ratio of their integral area is 1:1:1:1:1:1, proving that the EEPN is successful on the basis of the combined out EPN.\n\nThe 13C NMR spectrum of EEPN is shown in Figure 3. It can be seen that δ = 116.45 ppm and δ = 116.92 ppm are the characteristic peaks of the cyano group, δ = 56.22 ppm are the characteristic peaks of Cj for methoxy on the benzene ring, δ = 46.65 ppm and 52.31 ppm are the characteristic peaks of Ca and Cb for the epoxy group, and δ = 38.41 ppm is the characteristic peak of Cc. The distribution of aromatic carbon atoms was as follows: Ce, δ = 114.86 ppm; Cd, δ = 137.82 ppm; Cf, δ = 122.22 ppm; Cg, δ = 120.64 ppm; Ch, δ = 139.95 ppm; Ci, δ = 151.22 ppm; Ck, δ = 161.89 ppm; Cl, δ = 121.57 ppm; Cm, δ = 136.6 ppm; Cn, δ = 107.87 ppm; Co, δ = 115.93 ppm; and Cp, δ = 122.69 ppm. Thus, the structure of EEPN can be further determined.\n\nTable 1 shows the result of elemental analysis of EEPN, which has the molecular formula of C18H14N2O3 and a molecular weight of 306.32. The theoretical contents of C, H, and N in EEPN were 70.60%, 4.57%, and 9.15%, respectively, with a theoretical carbon–hydrogen ratio of 15.45, and the actual contents of C, H, and N in the product were 69.69%, 4.43%, and 9.34%, with a theoretical carbon–hydrogen ratio of 15.71. The deviation of C, H, and N contents in the product EEPN was within the error range, indicating that the synthesized EEPN was as expected.\n\nFigure 4 shows the DSC curve of EEPN, from which it can be seen that the starting melting temperature of EEPN is 125 °C, the melting point is 137 °C, and the termination melting temperature is 142 °C. The enthalpy of melting, ΔHf, can be calculated to be 28.7 J/g.\n\n2.2. Curing Mechanism for EEPN and EEPN (10%)/E51 Blend Resins Using DDS as Curing Agent via FTIR\n\nThe curing mechanism of the amine curing agent DDS curing EEPN and EEPN (10%) blend resins, respectively, was investigated by the analytical method of FTIR spectroscopy as an example of the curing mechanism of the amine curing agent DDS curing EEPN and EEPN/E51 blend resins.\n\nFigure 5 shows the infrared spectra of the DDS stepwise cured EEPN, from which it can be seen that the characteristic absorption peak of the epoxy group at 913 cm−1 in the figure became significantly weaker after warming up and curing compared with the uncured EEPN, indicating that the epoxy group reacted. Meanwhile, the double peaks of primary amines located between 3375 and 3456 cm−1 disappeared after elevated temperature curing compared with the uncured EEPN/DDS FTIR spectra plots. In addition, the increase in curing temperature resulted in a significant decrease in the peak intensity of the characteristic absorption peak of the cyano group at 2228 cm−1, indicating that the reaction of the cyano group on phthalonitrile occurred. The shift of the cyano absorption peak to a lower wave number suggested the possible formation of triazine derivatives and isoindoline structures. The C=N or C=N–C stretching vibration of the triazine ring was generally in the region of 1600–1700 cm−1, and it can be seen from the figure that the characteristic absorption bands of the triazine ring appeared in the range of 1656–1707 cm−1 but only after curing at 270 °C. Meanwhile, the characteristic absorption peak of the isoindoline structure around 1765 cm−1 appeared only after curing at temperatures above 270 °C.\n\nFigure 6 shows the infrared spectra of the curing process of EEPN (10%)/DDS at different temperatures. Compared with uncured EEPN (10%)/DDS, it can be seen that the characteristic absorption peaks of the epoxy groups at 913 cm−1 became significantly weaker after curing at elevated temperatures, and those of the cyano group at 2228 cm−1 became significantly weaker, suggesting that both epoxy groups and the cyano group participated in the polymerization reaction. The infrared spectra proved that there was still unreacted cyano group in the resin when the post-curing temperature was 270 °C. When the post-curing temperature was increased to 330 °C, the cyano group in the EEPN (10%)/DDS resin was basically reacted completely. As can be seen from Figure 6, when the post-curing temperature was below 300 °C, there was still the presence of the cyanide absorption peak located at 2228 cm−1 in the EEPN/DDS, indicating that there was still the presence of unreacted cyanide in the resin, and the analysis of the reason may be that the content of the cyanide structure on the less abundant EEPN of the EEPN (10%)/DDS was also relatively small, and it participated in the reaction at high temperatures (higher than 270 °C) to produce triazine derivatives and isoindoline structures more completely.\n\nFrom the analysis based on FTIR spectroscopy as above, it can be surmised that the curing mechanism of the amine curing agent DDS curing EEPN/E51 blend resins is shown in Scheme 2. The main reaction types are the ring-opening reaction between the active hydrogen of the amine group in the amine curing agent and the epoxy group and the nucleophilic addition reaction between the active hydrogen of the amine group and the cyano group. Both the ring opening and nucleophilic addition reactions increased the cross-linking density of the polymer and produced a stable ring structure, which improved the thermal stability of the substance.\n\n2.3. Curing Behavior and Curing Kinetics of E51/DDS and EEPN/DDS\n\nIn this work, DDS, a commonly used high-temperature amine curing agent, was selected to cure the prepared EEPN/E51 hybrid resins, and a non-isothermal differential scanning calorimetric curve was used to study the curing behavior and curing kinetics of EEPN/DDS.\n\nFigure 7 shows the DSC curves for E51/DDS and EEPN/DDS. As seen in the above graph, the DSC curves of both epoxy resins had a clear exothermic transition, and this exothermic phenomenon was caused by the reaction between the epoxy resin and the curing agent DDS. The onset curing temperature of the E51/DDS was 129.9 °C, the curing exothermic peak temperature of the E51/DDS resin was 232.7 °C, and the processing temperature window (the difference between the onset curing temperature and the exothermic peak temperature) was 102.8 °C. The DSC curve of the EEPN/DDS resin had a clear exothermic transition and a melting peak, and the test showed that the melting point of EEPN was 137 °C, which was close to the melting point of the EEPN monomer as measured by the DSC in the previous section; the cured exothermic peak temperature of this resin was 338 °C, and the processing temperature window was 201 °C.\n\nFigure 8 shows the DSC curves of E51/DDS, EEPN (10%)/DDS, EEPN (20%)/DDS, and EEPN (30%)/DDS with a ramp rate of 10 °C/min. Table 2 shows the DSC data of DSC curves of E51/DDS, EEPN (10%)/DDS, EEPN (20%)/DDS, and EEPN (30%)/DDS, where Ti, Tp, Tf, and ∆T are the initial curing temperature, peak curing temperature, end curing temperature, and curing interval, respectively. The analyses in Figure 7 and Figure 8 were performed at a heating rate of 10 °C/min.\n\nAs can be seen from Figure 8 and Table 2, the curing temperatures of EEPN (10%)/DDS, EEPN(20%)/DDS, and EEPN (30%)/DDS were higher than that of E51/DDS. The curing intervals were wider, which indicated that the exothermic enthalpy of curing of this hybrid resins was lower and the curing speed was slower, and it required higher curing temperatures and a longer time to cause the EEPN (n)/DDS blend resins to be cured completely.\n\nThe curing kinetics of EEPN/DDS were studied through the non-isothermal DSC test performed under different heating rates of 1, 3, 5, and 10 °C/min. The non-isothermal DSC curves of the three EEPN/DDS resins are shown in Figure S4, and the resins exhibited wide curing exothermic peaks at different heating rates. Due to the presence of epoxy groups and cyano groups in the structure of EEPN, two curing peaks did occur during the curing process; the first peak was the curing exothermic peak of the epoxy groups due to their faster exothermicity, and the second one was the curing exothermic peak of the cyano groups. Since this paper mainly investigated the curing process of the cyano group in EEPN in the curing kinetics section, the second peak was taken as the object of study. It can be seen that the exothermic peak of the DSC curve was obvious with the increase in the heating rate, and the exothermic peak was shifted to the high temperature with the increase in the heating rate, while the area gradually increased. This was due to the increase in the rate of the temperature increase; the heat released from the reaction was released in a shorter time, i.e., the reaction heat was released centrally [42].\n\nFigure S5 shows the linear fitting curves for the EEPN/DDS resin. Based on the slopes, we can calculate the apparent activation energy values for the EEPN/DDS resin fitted by the Kissinger and Ozawa equations to be 70.08 kJ/mol and 75.63 kJ/mol, respectively, with a mean activation energy average of 72.85 kJ/mol, which are derived from Tables S4 and S5. The kinetic equation for the curing of EEPN/DDS is shown in Equation (1), which is derived from Table S6.\n\nd α d t = 1.066 × 10 7 e x p ( − 124.28 R T ) ( 1 − α ) 1.0138\n\n(1)\n\n2.4. Thermal Stability\n\nFigure 9 shows the TGA and DTG curves of cured resins for E51/DDS and EEPN(n)/DDS blend resins (n = 10%, 20%, 30%) heated from room temperature to 800 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere.\n\nTable 3 shows the temperatures at 5% weight loss (Td5), 10% weight loss (Td10), 30% weight loss (Td30), maximum thermal weight loss rate temperature Td max, char yield at 800 °C (Yc800), and the statistical heat resistance index [43] (Ts) of E51/DDS versus EEPN(n)/DDS in a nitrogen atmosphere, where Ts can be used to qualitatively compare the thermal stability of various resins and can be obtained from Equation (2).\n\nT s = 0.49 ( T d 5 + 0.6 ( T d 30 − T d 5 ) )\n\n(2)\n\nFrom the data in Table 3, it can be seen that the Td5 of the EEPN (Td5 = 372.2 °C) was significantly higher compared with the Td5 of the epoxy resin E51 (Td5 = 330.2 °C). It can also be seen that the onset degradation temperature of the resin gradually increased by gradually increasing the content of EEPN in the EEPN/E51 blend resins from 0% to 30%. In terms of the amount of char yield of the cured material, the amount of char yield in the cured material of pure EEPN resin at 800 °C (Yc800) was 67.9%, which was much higher than that of pure epoxy resin (Yc800 = 26.3%). After the introduction of the phthalonitrile group, the char yield at 800 °C of the cured product gradually increased with the increase in the EEPN addition.\n\nIn the DTG curve, it can be observed that there was a clear peak in the interval of 310–490 °C for the cured material of E51/DDS resin, the decomposition rate was accelerated from 310 °C, and the maximum value of the decomposition rate was reached at 400 °C. The cured material of EEPN/DDS resin had a clear peak in the interval of 310–460 °C, the decomposition rate was accelerated from 310 °C, and the maximum value of the decomposition rate was reached at 393.7 °C. The decomposition rate was accelerated from 310 °C, and reached the maximum decomposition rate at 393.7 °C. Its thermal decomposition rate was significantly lower than that of the E51/DDS resin.\n\nWhen the reaction between phthalonitrile and epoxy groups in the eugenol-based epoxy-phthalonitrile resin occurred under the action of the curing agent DDS, the thermal degradation temperature and char yield were higher than that of the E51/DDS resin, and the thermal decomposition rate was lower than that of the E51/DDS resin, which indicated that the thermal performance of the eugenol-based epoxy-phthalonitrile resin synthesized in the present work was superior to that of the traditional bisphenol A-type epoxy resin E51. In addition, according to the thermogravimetric analysis data of the cured materials of EEPN (n)/DDS series hybrid resins, the introduction of the phthalonitrile group could significantly improve the thermal stability of the traditional epoxy resin E51, and the higher the amount of EEPN added, the better the thermal stability of the hybrid resin.\n\n2.5. Dynamic Mechanical Properties Studies\n\nFigure 10 shows the DMTA test curves for cured E51/DDS and EEPN(n)/DDS. The storage modulus–temperature curves are shown in Figure 10a, and the loss factor–temperature curves are shown in Figure 10b.\n\nAccording to Figure 10a, the initial energy storage modulus decreased with the increase in the EEPN addition, but the highest initial modulus of 1087 MPa was obtained for EEPN (20%)/DDS. The reason may be that after the introduction of a small amount of EEPN, the cross-linking point in the low-temperature curing interval (below 200 °C) decreased, which leads to a decrease in the modulus; after epoxy curing, the CN groups were restricted by the network formed by epoxy groups, which made it difficult to react sufficiently, thus leading to a decrease in the total cross-linking density and a decrease in the modulus. DDS can react with E51 to produce hydroxyl, which could catalyze CN cross-linking. When EEPN was added at 20%, a large number of triazine rings and isoindoline structures were formed, catalyzed by the hydroxyl group, and due to the small amount of EEPN added, there was less restriction on the epoxy network, which resulted in the largest modulus of EEPN (20%)/DDS.\n\nThe glass transition temperature (Tg) of the cured material can be obtained from the curve of the loss factor tanδ versus temperature, as shown in Figure 10b. From the data in the figure, it can be seen that the Tg of the EEPN (n)/DDS cured materials was higher than that of E51/DDS due to the high temperature-resistant cross-linking structure in the EEPN (n)/DDS cured materials, and the Tg increased with the increase in the EEPN content, which suggested that introduction of the cyano structure in the epoxy resins could improve the heat resistance of the epoxy resins.\n\n3. Materials and Methods\n\n3.1. Materials\n\nAll the reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification. N, N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) was obtained from Beijing Chemical Plant. (Beijing, China). Sodium hydroxide, perchloric acid, anhydrous ethanol, and dichloromethane were obtained from Beijing Tongguang Fine Chemical Company. (Beijing, China). Potassium hydrogen phthalate was purchased from J&K SCIENTIFIC. (Beijing, China). Deuterated chloroform (CDCl3), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d6), E51 epoxy resin, and 4,4′-diaminodiphenyl sulfones were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The 4-Nitrophthalonitrile, eugenol, anhydrous potassium carbonate, 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid, crystalline violet, and tetraethylammonium bromide were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. In addition, EPN was synthesized according to the literature of Wang et al. [39] and Ning, Yi, et al. [41]. The FTIR spectra (KBr) (Figure S1), 1H NMR spectrum of EPN (a) and 1H spectrum of EPN in the range 6.87–8.03 ppm (b) (Figure S2), 13C NMR spectra (Figure S3), and elemental analysis of EPN (Table S1) are presented in the Supplementary Information.\n\n3.2. Synthesis of EEPN\n\nAn amount of 0.01 mol (2.90 g) of eugenol-based o-phthalonitrile monomer with 0.02 mol (3.45 g) of 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid was added to a 100 mL beaker with a magnetic stirring rotor. A quantity of 30 mL of dichloromethane was added as solvent, and the reaction was stirred at room temperature for 24 h. The dichloromethane was subsequently removed by heating, and the reaction product was added to 0.5 mol/L NaOH solution; the solid product was washed out and washed four times with deionized water until neutral. Subsequently, a filtration operation was carried out, and the product was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for more than 6 h. A light-yellow solid powder, eugenol-based epoxy-phthalonitrile monomer, was finally obtained in a yield of 81.2%.\n\n3.3. Determination of Epoxy Value\n\nBased on the titration of perchloric acid glacial acetic acid solution using standard perchloric acid glacial acetic acid solution, crystal violet indicator, tetraethylammonium bromide, and potassium hydrogen phthalate (see Supplementary File), the data are shown in Tables S1 and S2. The concentration of standard perchloric acid glacial acetic acid solution was calculated to be 0.10195 mol/L, and the epoxide value of EEPN was 0.32.\n\n3.4. Preparation of Epoxy Resins and Curing Process\n\n3.4.1. Preparation of Epoxy Resins\n\nBio-based epoxy resin EEPN was added to petroleum-based epoxy resin E51 in different proportions of the total mass of the resin to obtain different proportions of EEPN(n)/E51 hybrid resins. EEPN is a yellowish powdery substance at room temperature, and E51 is a colorless transparent viscous substance at room temperature. EEPN and E51 epoxy resins were accurately weighed in a beaker according to the mass ratios of 100:0, 30:70, 20:80, 10:90, and 0:100, and the specimens were labeled as EEPN, EEPN (30%)/E51, EEPN (20%)/E51, EEPN (10%)/E51, and E51 blends, respectively. The formulations of the blended resin and curing agent 4,4′-diaminodiphenyl sulfone (DDS) are shown in Table 4. The EEPN/E51/DDS mixture was dissolved in an appropriate amount of methylene chloride at room temperature and ultrasonically mixed well in a CNC ultrasonic cleaner, and then the solvent was removed by heating.\n\n3.4.2. Curing Process\n\nThe EEPN/E51/DDS mixture was poured into the molds, and the curing process is shown in Figure 11. The curing was accomplished by undergoing a cure cycle of 150 °C for 2 h, 180 °C for 2 h, 210 °C for 2 h, 240 °C for 2 h, 300 °C for 2 h, and 330 °C for 2 h.\n\n3.5. Characterization\n\nThe 1H and 13C NMR were measured on a Bruker ADVANCE 400 MHz spectrometer (Bruker Switzerland AG, Fällanden, Switzerland). Deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO or CDCl3) was used as the solvent.\n\nFourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded with a Nicolet-IS5 (Thermos Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) spectrometer from 4000 to 400 cm−1 and 64 scans, using the KBr tablet preparation method for each sample.\n\nElemental analysis (EA) was performed using a Vairo EL CUBE type (GmbH, Mainhattan, Germany) elemental analyzer from 100% relative amounts of C, H, and N elements.\n\nDifferential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis was performed by a TA Instruments Q20 calorimeter under a nitrogen flow rate of 50 mL/min. Approximately 5 mg of each sample was sealed in aluminum pans, and the temperature was recorded between 25 and 350 °C at 10 °C/min, 5 °C/min, 3 °C/min, and 1 °C/min heating ramp.\n\nThermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a TGA Q500 (TA Instruments, New Castle, DE, USA) at a heating rate of 10 °C/min under a nitrogen purge of 100 mL/min. Approximately 10 mg of the specimen was placed in a ceramic crucible at a heating rate of 10 °C/min from 25 to 800 °C.\n\nDynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMA) was performed using a Q800 (TA Instruments) dynamic mechanical analyzer in single-cantilever mode. DMA measurements were performed on cured rectangular specimens at 3065.5 mm3. The measurements were performed at a temperature range of 30–200 °C, a heating rate of 5 °C/min, and a frequency of 1 Hz, and the sample size was 10 × 6.0 × 1.5 mm.\n\n4. Conclusions\n\nA eugenol-based epoxy-phthalonitrile monomer (EEPN) was prepared via epoxidation reaction from a eugenol-based phthalonitrile monomer (EPN), and the latter was obtained from biobased eugenol, providing a concise method for the preparation of bio-based epoxy resins with outstanding properties of heat resistance. The curing process, curing mechanism, and curing reaction kinetics of EEPN/DDS were investigated using DDS as the curing agent. The heat-resistant modification effect of EEPN addition on conventional bisphenol A-type epoxy resin using DDS as curing agent was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis and dynamic thermomechanical analysis. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that with the increase in the EEPN content, the char yield of EEPN/E51 blended resin at 800 °C was gradually increased, and its heat resistance was significantly improved. The char yield of the EEPN cured product at 800 °C was 67.9 wt%, which was much higher than that of the E51 cured product at 26.3 wt%. In addition, the dynamic thermo-mechanical analysis showed that due to the high-temperature resistant cross-linking structure in the EEPN(n)/DDS cured resins, the Tg of the EEPN(n)/DDS resins was higher than that of E51/DDS, with EEPN (100)/DDS having a Tg of up to 208 °C, which was considerably higher than that of E51/DDS (128 °C). The results proved that the introduction of cyanide structure groups into the molecular structure of epoxy resins using the amine curing agent improved the property of heat resistance.\n\nSupplementary Materials\n\nThe following supporting information can be downloaded at https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules29215019/s1: Figure S1: FTIR spectra of EPN and raw materials; Figure S2: 1H NMR spectrum of EPN (a) and 1H spectrum of EPN in the range 6.87–8.03 ppm (b); Figure S3: 13C NMR spectrum of EPN; Figure S4: 1H spectrum of EEPN in the range 6.97–8.04 ppm; Figure S5: 13C NMR spectrum of EEPN; Figure S6: The non-isothermal curing DSC curve of EEPN/DDS; Figure S7: Liner fitting curves of EEPN/DDS resins: (a) Ozawa equation and (b) Kissinger equation; Table S1: Elemental analysis results of EPN; Table S2: Results of acid calibration; Table S3: Epoxy titration results of EEPN; Table S4: The non-isothermal DSC data from the curing process of EEPN/DDS; Table S5: The parameters of non-isothermal DSC for EEPN/DDS; Table S6: Parameters of curing kinetics.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceptualization, R.X.; methodology, Y.D., R.X., Q.M., X.Z., and R.W.; validation, R.X.; formal analysis, R.X. and X.Z.; resources, R.X.; data curation, Y.D., R.W., Q.M., and R.X.; writing—original draft preparation, Y.D.; writing—review and editing, Y.D., R.W., X.Z., and R.X.; visualization, R.X.; supervision, R.X.; project administration, R.X.; funding acquisition, R.X. and R.W.

      "# [Cross-Linked Polyolefins: Opportunities for Fostering Circularity Throughout the Materials Lifecycle by Alison J Shapiro, Paul J Brigandi, Maria Moubarak, Saurav S Sengupta, Thomas H Epps](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11474822/)\nAbstract\n\nCross-linked polyolefins (XLPOs) constitute a significant portion of the plastics commercial market, with a market size of a similar order of magnitude to those of polystyrene and polyethylene terephthalate. However, few aspects of XLPO materials circularity have been examined relative to thermoplastic polyolefins. The cross-linking of polyolefins imparts superior performance properties, such as impact strength, chemical and electrical resistance, and thermal stability vs thermoplastic analogues, but it also makes the reprocessing of XLPOs to valuable products more challenging, as XLPOs cannot be molten. Thus, most XLPOs are incinerated or landfilled at the end of the first lifecycle, even though XLPO products are commonly collected as a relatively clean waste stream–providing a unique opportunity for valorization. In this review, we discuss approaches to improve XLPO circularity throughout the entire materials lifecycle by examining biobased feedstocks as alternative olefinic monomer sources and by assessing both traditional mechanical and advanced XLPO recycling methods based on industrial feasibility and potential product value. We also consider how advancing materials longevity can reduce environmental impacts and lifecycle costs and how recyclable-by-design strategies can enable better end-of-life opportunities for future generations of XLPO materials. Throughout this review, we highlight XLPO circularity routes that have the potential to balance the performance, circularity, and scalability necessary to impart economic and environmental viability at an industrial scale.\n\nKeywords: circularity, sustainability, lifecycle management, cross-linked polyolefin, cross-linked polyethylene, recycling\n\n1. Introduction\n\nAchieving polymer circularity is critical to address the adverse effects commonly associated with linear materials’ lifecycles, such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the manufacturing and accumulation of plastics waste. Polyolefins (POs), encompassing polymers such as polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP), constitute a substantial share of the global plastics market. Over 180 million metric tons of POs are produced from virgin feedstocks, and greater than 150 million metric tons of POs are discarded globally each year, which results in vast quantities of plastics waste.1 PE alone, the highest volume PO, accounted for over 65% of major resin (i.e., unprocessed plastic) manufactured globally in 2022, with a market of 124 million metric tons and >4% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) since 2018.2 Cross-linked PE (XLPE or PEX) – the largest volume cross-linked PO (XLPO) – comprises ∼5–10% of the total PE market with an expected 6–8% CAGR,1 which makes XLPO one of the most abundant commercial polymers–with a market size of a similar order of magnitude to those of polystyrene and polyethylene terephthalate.3\n\nXLPOs have superior performance properties relative to thermoplastic POs (e.g., better impact strength, chemical and electrical resistance, thermal stability) that are critical to their use in applications such as pipelines, storage tanks, foams, and cable insulations.4,5 For instance, XLPO is commonly leveraged in plumbing and radiant heating systems because it can maintain its structural integrity at higher temperatures than thermoplastic POs.6 XLPO is also often employed in cables to insulate the metal conductor(s) (e.g., copper) because of XLPO’s electric, heat, and moisture resistance.7 XLPOs can be derived from various types of POs, including PP, low-density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) for distinct characteristics tailored to specific use cases.4 For example, LDPE- or LLDPE-based XLPE is preferred in applications requiring flexibility, such as wire and cable insulation, whereas HDPE-based XLPE is favored in applications requiring substantial rigidity, such as pipes.4 It is worth noting that even though the majority of commercial XLPOs are XLPE, cross-linked PP, blends, and copolymers are likely to grow in interest as there can be performance and sustainability advantages to incorporating these other macromolecules (e.g., PP has increased thermal, ultraviolet (UV), and chemical resistance and higher rigidity than PE).8−11 XLPOs are usually highly cross-linked materials; for example, ASTM standards for XLPE tubing require a 65 to 89% degree of cross-linking.12 To achieve such cross-linking in POs, there are three primary strategies–peroxide, radiation, and silane cross-linking (Figure 1). Peroxide and radiation (with electron beam radiation being the most prominent) methods generate free radicals that result in the formation of cross-links between PO chains.13−15 Silane cross-linking (also known as moisture cross-linking) operates by the radical grafting of alkoxysilane cross-linkers to the PO backbone, followed by a condensation reaction to cross-link the polymer chains.14,16 Peroxide cross-linking is versatile and suitable for various applications because it offers a broad processing window and fast cross-linking of different form factors,4 but this option requires precise temperature control during extrusion and has significant equipment costs.15,16 In contrast, radiation cross-linking provides consistent results, but the technique is expensive and more suitable for thin-walled specialty cable applications due to the penetration limitations of radiation.14,15 For PP cross-linking, with either peroxides or radiation, cross-linking coagents are employed to reduce chain scission.9 Silane cross-linking is cost-effective, requires minimal additional equipment, and is popular in low voltage cables and pipes;15,16 however, the approach relies on moisture diffusion, which leads to longer cure times (particularly in dry environments), sensitivity to moisture content during curing, and susceptibility to premature cross-linking.14,16 On an industrial scale, XLPOs are generally extruded and/or injection molded then cured with specific processing conditions that depend on the application.14 For a more in-depth discussion of XLPO cross-linking techniques and manufacturing, a review by Ahmad and Rodrigue provides further insights.15\n\nThe starting PO material, cross-linking method, cross-linking degree, and other factors affect the material properties of XLPO. For example, peroxide-cured LDPE with a gel content of 83% and molecular weight between cross-links of ∼20 000 g/mol had a melting temperature (Tm) of 110 °C, tensile strength of 18.8 MPa, and elongation-at-break of 550%.17 In another example, silane-cross-linked HDPE with 70% gel content had a Tm of 133 °C, tensile modulus of 1023 MPa, tensile strength of 21.4 MPa, elongation-at-break of 389%, and crystalline fraction of 60%.18 Furthermore, application-specific standards dictate the minimum material requirements for XLPOs. For example, IEC 60502–1 is used for XLPE cable insulation and requires a minimum tensile strength of 12.5 MPa and elongation-at-break of 200% with a 25% maximum variation after heat aging.19 The specific application also imposes the standards used to assess properties such as the degree of cross-linking. For example, the wire and cable industry relies on hot set testing to assess cross-linking, in which a maximum permissible hot set elongation is 175%, as is delineated in IEC 60811–507.20 Alternatively, the pipes industry has specific cross-linking degree requirements that depend on the cross-linking mechanism (minimum gel content is 70% by peroxides, 65% by radiation, and 65% by silane cross-linking), as is delineated in ASTM F876–23 for pressure tubing.12 Such regulatory standards ensure consistent performance of XLPOs across applications.\n\nThe high performance of XLPOs comes at the expense of circularity. XLPOs cannot be molten, and hence, most commercial XLPOs follow a linear lifecycle and are landfilled/incinerated after the first use. This end-of-life outcome is environmentally unsustainable, contributes to pollution and resource depletion, and poses economic concerns. Although efforts have been made to collect XLPO waste at the end of its lifecycle, challenges persist in handling and efficiently recycling XLPO, which emphasizes the urgent need for scalable XLPO circularity processes.21 For instance, MTB Recycling (one of the largest cable recyclers in Europe) has an annual recycling capacity of 40,000 t of cables; however, the recovery and sale of copper and other metals is their major focus, and finding profitable solutions for the plastic cable components remains a challenge.21 As XLPO products are already collected and separated, such scenarios provide a unique opportunity for valorization. Previous reviews have focused specifically on XLPE recycling but have not covered the broader sustainability of XLPOs throughout the entire materials lifecycle.15,16,22 Broader PO circularity reviews tend to focus almost exclusively on thermoplastic POs with few including XLPO recycling.23−25 Thus, there is an opportunity to holistically examine the circularity and sustainability challenges, innovations, and opportunities for XLPOs from feedstock to end-of-life.\n\nThis review discusses sustainable solutions to improve the circularity of XLPOs throughout the entire materials lifecycle with a focus on strategies that have the potential to be economically and environmentally viable at an industrial scale. An overview of the materials circularity approaches considered in this review is shown in Figure 2. Strategies explored include employing biobased feedstocks to generate olefinic monomers, and examples in which such feedstocks are already in use commercially are highlighted. Existing methods that extend the first XLPO lifecycle are emphasized to maximize the material’s time in the “circularity loop” and reduce the amount of virgin feedstock consumed. Mechanical recycling processes and applications for ground XLPO as a filler/aggregate are discussed, and advanced recycling strategies that de-cross-link/deconstruct XLPOs are assessed on the basis of product value, scalability, and circularity. Additionally, XLPOs that are recyclable-by-design via dynamic covalent chemistries also are addressed, and key factors for evaluating these redesigned materials as alternatives to conventional XLPOs are proposed. The review concludes with considerations of future challenges and opportunities for sustainable XLPOs to balance high-performance demands with scalability and circularity.\n\n2. Biobased Olefinic Monomer Feedstocks\n\nThe majority of all commercial POs are synthesized from petroleum-derived monomeric feedstocks, which raises concerns about GHG emissions, limited availability of fossil fuels, and global resource stability.1,26 Biomass feedstocks have emerged as a promising alternative to petroleum for polymer production,26 with global biobased polymer manufacturing reaching 4.5 million tons in 2022 and a forecasted CAGR of 14% through 2027.27 More specifically, the biobased PO market is predicted to grow by 20x over the next ten years.28 Braskem’s “I’m Green” PE is the largest-scale bio-PE on the market with 179 kton sold in 2022 and is the first certified bio-PE.29 Other examples of commercial biobased POs include Dow’s ENGAGE REN Polyolefin Elastomers33 and Avient Corporation’s Maxxam BIO POs.30,31 Braskem’s plastics are synthesized from sugarcane ethanol;29 Dow’s polymers are derived from tall oil (a byproduct of wood pulping);30 and Avient’s materials incorporate renewable fillers from cellulose fiber and olive seed powder.31 There are numerous pathways to produce biobased POs, each with advantages and limitations. For example, ethylene can be synthesized biologically through sugar fermentation to dehydrated ethanol or catalytically, as shown in Figure 3A and discussed in the recent review by Dutta.32 Examples of pathways to produce bio-PP are shown in Figure 3B.33 An important consideration to the overall sustainability of biobased POs is the source of the feedstock (i.e., whether it is a first-, second-, or third-generation feedstock). First-generation biomass sources are food crops, and thus, could potentially compete with food production and raise concerns about arable land usage.34 Second- and third-generation biomass (comprised of cellulosic and waste residues/algae for second- and third-generation, respectively) encompass a range of nonedible biomass sources including agricultural/industrial residues, municipal solid waste, and algae.34 Future research could investigate the synthesis of XLPOs from second- and third-generation biomass to potentially alleviate food system and environmental concerns, as discussed in a review on the manufacture of bio-PE from wood waste by Mendieta et al.35 Yet, it is critical to note that just because a biomass feedstock is second/third generation does not necessarily make it more environmentally friendly. For instance, a lifecycle assessment (LCA) on the manufacture of lactic acid from edible corn vs corn stover found that the manufacturing of the corn stover lactic acid had ∼47% increased monetized environmental costs than edible-corn lactic acid, mostly due to the additional pretreatment steps required for the corn stover-based feedstock.36 Therefore, beyond the selection of a non-petroleum feedstock, it is also important to certify the sustainability/carbon neutrality and evaluate the economic/environmental viability of proposed biobased polyolefins. A number of sustainability certification systems exist and were reviewed by Ramirez-Contreras et al.37 One example is the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) framework, which was developed to provide a globally applicable certification system for the sustainability of raw materials and products.38 Other methods for the evaluation of proposed circularity solutions include technoeconomic analysis (TEA) and mass balance accounting (a metric for quantifying circularity) that can apply both to bio-XLPOs and the rest of the strategies described herein.39−41\n\nDespite their potential for environmental impact reduction, bio-XLPOs have yet to be produced commercially. Bio-olefinic monomers can be leveraged to synthesize bio-XLPOs with identical chemical structures (as depicted in Figure 3), manufacturing, and properties vs their petroleum-derived analogues, in a similar manner to the commercially available thermoplastic bio-POs described above.42 The biggest obstacle for drop-in biobased feedstocks is cost–for example, the price of bio-PE currently is ∼1.3–1.5x higher than the price of the petroleum-derived equivalent.43 Yet, for scenarios in which either fossil fuel prices increase or governments enact carbon taxes or similar policies, drop-in alternatives could become more commercially viable.44,45 Biobased XLPOs could improve the sustainability of the monomer feedstock by eliminating the need for virgin fossil fuels and adding temporary carbon sequestration during the biomass growth stage; however, the specific strategy to make bio-XLPO must be evaluated to ensure that the overall process, from feedstock to polymer, leads to a reduction in environmental impacts.46 Furthermore, because the structure of the monomers and final product are identical to traditional XLPOs, the same end-of-life concerns with regards to sustainability exist for bio-XLPOs.41 Thus, although bio-XLPOs can reduce environmental impacts during XLPO production, renewable feedstocks must be used in conjunction with the approaches presented in the following sections to improve overall XLPO circularity.\n\n3. Extending XLPO’s First Lifecycle\n\nThe optimization of XLPO design for longevity decreases carbon emissions by lowering replacement frequency and reducing demand for raw materials and manufacturing. Additionally, the extension of XLPO’s first lifespan mitigates materials disposal challenges, which delays entry into the recycling stream, and thus postpones the need for recycling infrastructure and potentially energy-intensive reprocessing. Sustainability is enhanced because a longer lifespan for XLPO contributes to more efficient management of resources throughout the material lifecycle. An LCA comparing the use portion (often associated with power loss) to the manufacture portion of XLPE cables revealed that manufacture amounts to >2x more global warming potential (GWP; expressed in kg of CO2 equivalents) than use for both overhead and underground cables, (Figure 4) – emphasizing the environmental significance of materials longevity.47 Another LCA suggested that 1 trillion kg of CO2 equivalents are emitted as a result of additional power generation required to compensate for transmission and distribution infrastructure-related power losses (determined by the combination of power generation and uncertainty analysis across 142 countries).48 Infrastructure technical losses that result from limits such as aging (i.e., less efficient) or failing cables require power plants to generate more than 1 kWh to deliver 1 kWh to a customer, and thus, extending XLPE cable’s longevity can improve infrastructure efficiency, decrease the required excess power generation, and reduce GHG emissions.48 In an additional example, XLPE pipes, when substituted for traditional copper pipes in residential water plumbing, reduced building costs by up to 63% and GHG emissions by 42%.49 These GHG and cost savings are mostly due to higher copper installation costs and increased required maintenance, as copper is more prone to corrosion and leaking than XLPE.49 Copper pipes generally have a longer lifecycle than XLPE pipes (50 vs 25 years for copper vs XLPE, respectively), but future research into XLPE formulations to increase longevity to be above that of copper could result in further cost and GHG savings.\n\nThe lifetime of cables has no single determining factor; XLPO insulation plays a considerable role in cable performance, but other variables such as incidents (e.g., weather events, mechanical damage from digging), voltage, ampacity, temperature, and the installation environment are also contributors. Thus, improving cable insulation is beneficial but not the only aspect to consider to enhance overall cable sustainability. One important aspect of insulation performance is that cables may be exposed to electrical stress in a moist environment (e.g., when directly buried in the ground) and are therefore subject to water-tree-growth deterioration.50 Water treeing is a phenomenon in which branching degradation channels, which originate from water contact under electric fields, develop within the insulation of power cables and impair performance and longevity.51 A medium voltage cable lifecycle cost study can provide insights into the advantages of prolonging the lifespan of XLPO materials in this regard. For this scenario, the anticipated 25-year lifespan of XLPE was compared to the anticipated 40-year lifespan of water tree-retardant XLPE (TR-XLPE).52 TR-XLPE is a specific formulation of XLPE designed to resist water treeing through the incorporation of a low-level, nonmigratory additive package to enable longer service life.51 The study revealed a substantial decrease in lifecycle costs for TR-XLPE, with ∼50% total cost savings over the materials lifecycle relative to traditional XLPE.52 The analysis incorporated testing of field-aged cables and accelerated laboratory testing, including the examination of cables buried for 17 years, and showcased the retention of dielectric strength that was augmented by data from accelerated wet-aging tests.52 This significant economic improvement emphasizes the benefits linked to the deliberate selection of materials designed for enhanced longevity. There are also other methods to prepare XLPOs under assisted electric fields that can enhance electric breakdown strength, decrease conductivity, and potentially improve durability/longevity without additional additive incorporation.53 Although negative environmental impacts are anticipated to decrease by prolonging XLPE cable longevity, future LCA is needed to confirm this conjecture; moreover, the effect of additive packages on recyclability needs further investigation.\n\n4. Traditional Mechanical Recycling and Applications for Ground XLPO\n\nMechanical recycling is the most widely adopted recycling technique and is presently considered the most economically feasible method at an industrial scale.54 This approach involves reprocessing plastic waste into secondary raw materials and products through physical means.54 Mechanical recycling has been reviewed extensively for thermoplastic polymers such as POs and also has been applied to XLPO waste for reclamation and reuse.24,55 Unlike many other polymers, sorting XLPO poses fewer challenges, benefiting from specific point sources as opposed to the complex mix found in larger post-consumer recycling plants. Yet, inherent limitations emerge, especially if the cross-linked structure undergoes significant alteration during manufacturing or use.56 One of the major challenges with the mechanical recycling of XLPOs is that neither XLPO nor its resulting recyclate can be molten. Consequently, the recyclate is often incorporated in a blend or composite for processing and is effectively positioned as a filler.\n\nMechanical recycling typically includes collection, sorting, materials comminution (e.g., grinding to controlled particle sizes, typically 50–900 μm, depending on the specific mechanical recycling process),17,56−58 cleaning, reprocessing at different weight ratios, and providing reinforcement for various polymer systems.24,59−61 Based on the XLPO source, the recyclate often contains contaminants–for example, cable recyclate may include 1–2 wt % metal contamination.17Figure 5A-C illustrates examples of spent XLPE cable, representative cable stripped down to XLPE, and XLPE cable ground into smaller particles, respectively. Figure 5D-E compares the tensile properties and thermal stabilities of ground XLPE recyclate to unprocessed XLPE. Figure 5D shows the lower elongation-at-break and higher tensile stress for injection-molded, ground XLPE recyclate relative to injection-molded, unprocessed XLPE (blue vs red curves).17 A higher temperature injection-molding process appeared to slightly decrease the ultimate tensile strength of the final product (green vs blue curves).17Figure 5E illustrates the similarity in thermal stability before and after two recycling times in a thermomechanical batch mixer.62 These two examples are representative of the general trend for XLPOs in which mechanical recycling has a larger effect on tensile properties and a smaller effect on the thermal stabilities. Additionally, in-depth recyclate characterization should be incorporated in future mechanical recycling studies to understand how material degradation resulting from the grinding process impacts XLPO microstructure.\n\n4A. Applications as a Filler\n\nTo overcome potential degradation in performance, recycled XLPO often is blended with virgin PO to achieve desired properties, and fundamental technical variables such as XLPO loading, particle size, and layer separation have been examined to optimize these formulations. Ground, recycled XLPOs generally are reintroduced into virgin thermoplastic materials at relatively low weight percentages (i.e., 1–25 wt %). The addition of XLPO often improves some properties and worsens others–for instance, higher loadings of XLPE in an XLPE/HDPE blend increased impact strength by ∼30% but decreased flexural strength and modulus by ∼10%.57 As a balance must be struck between raising the XLPO loading and maintaining required performance properties, several studies have investigated the optimal XLPO-to-virgin-material ratio for specific processing applications. For example, Diaz et al. demonstrated that up to 35 wt % ground XLPE from cables could be used in a PE matrix for rotational molding applications without a significant reduction in tensile and flexural properties.56 Lindqvist et al. incorporated 25–50 wt % loadings of XLPE from both cable manufacturing waste and end-of-life cables into blends with PP and found that higher XLPE loadings (50 vs 25 wt %) increased strain-at-break and impact strength, but decreased elastic modulus and stress-at-break.58 Furthermore, the blends containing XLPE from end-of-life cables experienced more severe degradation upon aging at 105 °C for six months, although the addition of an antioxidant/metal deactivator (Irganox MD 1024) was successful in retaining mechanical properties over an extended period (accelerated aging for 6000 h).58 In comparison to XLPO loading, particle size appears to have a lesser impact on the overall performance of XLPO blends. For instance, Freitas et al. found that particle size significantly affected only the tensile strength out of five mechanical properties tested (impact strength, tensile strength, tensile strain-at-break, flexural strength, flexural modulus) in XLPE/HDPE blends,57 and White et al. demonstrated that the particle size did not appreciably change the material properties for blends containing reprocessed XLPE when subjected to injection molding under high pressure.17 Beyond investigating XLPO loading and particle size, Diaz et al., showed that multilayer molding improved external appearance and mechanical property retention relative to monolayer molding of an XLPO/PE blend and may enable higher loadings of XLPO going forward.56 Possible next steps should focus on further optimization of these blends and characterization of XLPO blends’ material performance (e.g., thermal stability, UV resistance) beyond the mechanical properties mentioned above.\n\nXLPO blends have already found utility in, or been proposed for, a variety of applications as illustrated by the examples below. Ground XLPE from cable scrap has been compounded into virgin PE matrices that could be used for injection molding of cable guards and packaging articles, extrusion of internal cable jackets, and rotational molding of parts.59 Finely ground XLPO foam has been introduced as a filler to HDPE (up to 30 wt %), which increased impact strength and tensile strength-at-break by over 400% and 40%, respectively, without significantly affecting other mechanical properties.60 XLPE foam aggregates also have been incorporated in non-woven, geotextile composites for floating covers employed in odor/air emission control from manure storage structures.61 These applications grant the recycled material an additional life, though work to determine how many times remolding may be possible is critical to assess the true “circularity” of such materials. Particular attention must be paid to the amount of contamination (particularly from metals in cables and additives in all XLPO formulations), as higher contamination levels can lead to greater degradation over material lifetimes.58\n\nThe behavior at the particle interface and the compatibility between XLPO and the matrix are important considerations for XLPO blends. As XLPO particles are cross-linked, the chemical/physical bonding at the interface with the continuous matrix is likely relatively weak (compared to the interface of a comparable blend without cross-linked particles), leading to poor interfacial adhesion. Lindqvist et al. investigated the compatibility of ground XLPE particles from cable manufacturing waste at 50 wt % loading in a PP matrix using scanning electron microscopy.58 The XLPE particles appeared well dispersed with no visible voids at the interface between the particle and matrix; nonetheless, sharp edges around the particles suggested that the interaction between the two materials was indeed low.58 Fortunately, analysis of blending recycled ground tire rubber into thermoplastic matrices may offer insight into various techniques to enhance XLPO/matrix compatibility.64 These techniques include the use of compatibilizers or coupling agents, nanofillers, and energy treatment, as well as processes like devulcanization and revulcanization to improve the interfacial adhesion and dispersion of the ground tire rubber.64 Similarly, compatibilization approaches have been applied to mixed plastics waste recycling, in which material streams consist of multiple immiscible polymers.65 For example, compatibilizers in the form of block copolymers, non-reactive polar polymers, and reactive functionalized polymers can improve adhesion in plastic/plastic blends.65 Similar compatibilization strategies may be beneficial to the performance of ground XLPO blends.\n\n4B. Applications as an Aggregate\n\nAggregates for building materials are traditionally dominated by sand, gravel, or crushed rock, which can comprise a majority of the total mixture (e.g., ∼80 vol % or 90 wt % for asphalt).66 Traditional aggregates face concerns such as resource scarcity and adverse impacts on the environment in the mining region.67 Mechanically recycled XLPO finds extensive use as an aggregate in construction materials to alleviate these environmental concerns and decrease the overall material weight because XLPO is significantly less dense than traditional aggregates.68 For example, Vidales-Barriguete et al. incorporated XLPE cable waste directly (without any selection or pretreatment) into gypsum boards, such as drywall panels.69 XLPE-containing boards exhibited increased elasticity and marginally improved thermal conductivity and surface comfort while remaining within the necessary compliance values for flexural strength.69\n\nConcrete and cement applications also benefit from the incorporation of mechanically recycled XLPO as an aggregate.70 For instance, Reiterman et al. partially replaced natural sand with crushed cable waste in cement, which slightly improved freeze–thaw resistance and reduced bulk density.68 Although the compressive and flexural strengths of the hardened screed were reduced proportionally with the amount of cable waste, these properties remained within the specified technical requirements.68 Notably, this example of cable waste used a mixture of XLPE, poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), and PE, and it highlights the robustness of such applications to handle less pure XLPO product mixtures.68 The elasticity of XLPO also led to improved cracking resistance properties to concrete and cement.71 Another study assessed the viability of the incorporation of up to 15 vol % XLPE waste as a partial substitute for traditional stone aggregates in concrete.72 Increased XLPE content improved workability and ductility, decreased unit weight and cracking, and maintained compliance with industry standards for compressive strength, as shown in Figure 6.72 This enhanced ductility makes XLPE-containing concrete more suitable for applications that are particularly susceptible to cracking, such as irrigation canals.72 One remaining concern is the risk of aggregate products entering the environment as leachates or microplastics, especially for use cases such as canals. Assessment of this risk is necessary for such applications before full-scale implementation.\n\nA particularly promising avenue for the application of mechanically recycled XLPE is as an aggregate or binder replacement in asphalt, similar to recycled ground tire rubber. XLPE powder has been used as an asphalt modifier to improve thermal stability and significantly reduce melt viscosity, thereby improving asphalt processing.73 The incorporation of waste XLPE also increases material resistance to rutting/fatigue and elasticity of bitumen.74 Additionally, the inclusion of XLPE can decrease the density of asphalt to enable more lightweight structures, improve permanent deformation and temperature resistance, and retain similar water resistance to conventional asphalt.75 Although applications as an aggregate or filler may not result in the higher-value products that can be achieved with advanced recycling techniques, there are a number of existing applications for mechanically recycled XLPO that are already industrially feasible and can be immediately implemented more broadly to improve the circularity of XLPO and the longevity of the systems into which repurposed XLPO is incorporated.\n\n5. Advanced Recycling and Materials Valorization\n\nAdvanced recycling involves the breakdown of XLPOs to create new products and can be classified as de-cross-linking, depolymerization, or deconstruction. De-cross-linking breaks only the cross-links while keeping the polymer backbone intact, depolymerization converts the polymer back to the original monomer, and deconstruction cleaves the polymer into smaller units (Figure 7). Each of these recycling methods leads to varying types of products with enormous ranges in material properties, and thus, each approach may be suitable for different applications.\n\nAlthough a process-based differentiation can be made, herein, advanced recycling strategies were viewed from a product perspective (i.e., recycling thermosets into thermoplastics or recycling thermosets into lighter hydrocarbons, oils, and monomers). The primary reason for this approach is that POs are chain-growth polymers with C–C backbone bonds that require a large amount of energy to break, and PO degradation typically proceeds heterogeneously, which yields a mixture of products, including gases, oils, char, and wax, with wide molecular weight distributions that depend on the feedstock and process conditions.76 Furthermore, due to the more homogeneous molecular structure of peroxide- and radiation-cured XLPOs, it is virtually impossible to break down the structure into small molecules without de-cross-linking. Conversely, it is difficult to selectively target only the cross-links without some cleavage of the main chain. An overview of the advantages and limitations of the advanced recycling methods discussed in this section is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1. XLPO Recycling Strategies with Associated Advantages and Limitations.\n\nMajor Recycling Product Strategy Advantages Limitations Thermoplastics Mechanochemical milling77−80 Reprocessable products, inexpensive Thermal stability, batch process Ultrasonic extrusion81 Reprocessable products Cost, backbone degradation Supercritical fluid de-cross-linking65,82−86 Reprocessable products Higher temperatures and pressures, cost, scalability Oligomers, small molecules, and monomers Pyrolysis87 Higher conversion rates Lower-value products, pollution concerns Catalytic deconstruction88 Higher-value products Higher costs, requires further development Liquefaction89 Capable of handling waste mixtures Higher costs, requires further development\n\nA major consideration for recycling XLPO is the cross-linking chemistry employed, such as peroxide or silane-curing. For example, peroxide-cured XLPE is generally more homogeneously cross-linked than silane-cured XLPE (Si-XLPE); hence, Si-XLPE typically breaks down in a more localized (i.e., less uniform) manner than peroxide-cured XLPE.90 Si-XLPE is more sensitive to property degradation, potentially because of its higher heterogeneity enabling XLPE degradation to occur in local centers with increased reactivity.90 Furthermore, the type of bonds in the cross-link significantly impacts the approach and ease of cleavage. An unsubstituted C–C bond’s dissociation energy is ∼72–87 kcal/mol, whereas a siloxane bond’s dissociation energy is typically >120 kcal/mol, therefore ∼1.4–1.7x more energy is required to break a siloxane bond vs an unsubstituted C–C bond.91 Additional considerations include the degree of cross-linking, additives, cost, and sustainability.\n\n5A. Recycling Thermosets to Thermoplastics\n\nMechanochemistry, in the form of solid-state milling, is a de-cross-linking strategy that has gained recent prominence, with popular strategies including pan-milling and continuous twin-screw extrusion.77,80 Pan-milling, also known as solid-state-shear milling, is a poplar mechanochemistry strategy that grinds material between two rotating planes equipped with teeth designed to induce a combined compression and circumferential shearing impact.78 Pan-milling aims to selectively de-cross-link XLPO, without significant cleavage of the polymer backbone, by preferential breakage at the cross-links as the highest stresses and moments are likely to accumulate at these sites during milling.79 Pan-milling has been used to recycle waste XLPE cables into phosphogypsum-containing composites for applications such as waterproofing.92 In addition to XLPO-related uses, solid-state shear milling has broader applicability in recycling rubber tire waste and has been used to prepare thermoplastic vulcanizates from 50/50 XLPE/tire rubber blends.93\n\nCross-linking in both Si-XLPE and peroxide-cured XLPE has been effectively reduced via pan-milling in several studies, with gel fractions (measured by Soxhlet extraction) decreasing from 77 to 14 wt % and 70 to 15 wt % after 20 cycles for Si- and peroxide-cured XLPE, respectively.77,79 After milling Si-XLPE, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis showed a large reduction in the peak at 1030 cm–1 (corresponding to the siloxane bond −Si–O–Si–) in the milled vs unmilled Si-XLPE.77 Taken together, the gel content reduction and FTIR spectra demonstrate the deconstruction of the cross-links. The molecular weight of the soluble fraction of the XPLE was measured via gel permeation chromatography (GPC) – i.e., GPC was performed on the 30 wt % that is not cross-linked in 70 wt % cross-linked XLPE.77,79 Despite the authors’ claims that an increase in the molecular weight of the soluble fraction for the milled vs unmilled Si-XLPE meant that the de-cross-linking occurred without breakage of the main chain, one could also conclude that the GPC traces indicate that chain scission has occurred because the molecular weight of the soluble fraction after milling is ∼3x lower than the PE molecular weight before cross-linking.77 Reconciliation of the molecular weight data is an essential component in future efforts to determine the extent of backbone degradation during milling. Rheology measurements (e.g., zero-shear viscosity) are one approach that has been implemented to indirectly measure the molecular weight of the de-cross-linked material.80 This method reflects contributions for both the cross-linked and un-cross-linked portions of the polymer through the use of the empirical relationship between the melt viscosity and molecular weight, although differentiating between contributions from chain lengths, branches, cross-links, and fillers remains a challenge.80 Mechanochemistry is considered a cost-effective and environmentally friendly method in comparison to other advanced recycling strategies to reprocess thermosets with the potential to retain better mechanical properties vs traditional mechanical recycling; however, studies are still necessary to address the energy intensity associated with numerous milling cycles, apply mechanochemistry strategies to radiation-cross-linked XLPE, and investigate whether milling results in small molecules that can leach out from the product in a future lifecycle.\n\nUltrasonically aided extrusion also has been investigated as a physical recycling approach, inspired by similar strategies that devulcanize cross-linked rubbers.15,81 In this method, ultrasonic generators are used in conjunction with extruders to reduce melt viscosity, thereby improving processability.94 Huang et al. investigated the de-cross-linking of peroxide-cross-linked HDPE and LDPE with twin-screw, ultrasonically aided extruders and found a reduction in gel content from 93 to 27 wt % and 93 to 61 wt % for cross-linked HPDE and LDPE, respectively.81 Factors that impact the de-cross-linking include the screw design, extruder type, ultrasonic amplitude, and XLPE branching.15,81 Long-chain branching in cross-linked LDPE enhances breakage of the main chain because long chains reduce the material’s ability to change configuration when subjected to strong biaxial deformation, which possibly causes increased stretching in the XLPE and backbone degradation.81 Ultrasonic extrusion has the potential for increased throughput; however, the abovementioned polymer backbone degradation and high costs may be problematic.15\n\nAnother advanced recycling strategy investigated for XLPO de-cross-linking leverages supercritical fluids, which are excellent plastics decomposition media.65 Peroxide-, radiation-, and siloxane-cross-linked XLPEs have been de-cross-linked with supercritical alcohols, including methanol, ethanol, and propanol. Methanol is the most common reaction medium because of its relatively mild critical conditions [critical temperature (Tc) = 240 °C, critical pressure (Pc) = 8.1 MPa] and high efficacy.95 For example, Cho et al. completely de-cross-linked XLPE in supercritical methanol, with the gel content decreasing from 88 to 0 wt %.83 Other studies have proposed swapping supercritical alcohol for supercritical water to alleviate the toxicity concerns associated with methanol; however, supercritical water has a higher Tc and Pc, (Tc = 374 °C, Pc = 22.1 MPa), which makes potential recycling systems more expensive than those using supercritical alcohols.82,84,96 Furthermore, de-cross-linking with supercritical water has only been demonstrated successfully on Si-XLPE, but the process has not been extended to peroxide- or radiation-cured XLPE.82,84 A major concern associated with supercritical fluid de-cross-linking is that most proposed strategies were run in batch reactors, and thus need to be adapted to continuous setups to improve scaleup feasibility and costs.85 Baek et al. de-cross-linked peroxide-cured XLPE in a continuous, multiscale single-screw extrusion process at a feeding rate of 7 mL/min with the XLPE in contact with the supercritical fluid for <2 min,85 but this feeding rate is still relatively slow; hence more work is required to scale these systems and address concerns about industrial suitability stemming from higher costs.\n\nThe ultimate recyclate properties are important considerations for all the above de-cross-linking techniques. The work by Zack et al., which employed a solid-state shear pulverization de-cross-linking strategy on peroxide-cross-linked XLPE and achieved a minimum gel content of 2%, is presented as a case study of de-cross-linked XLPO recyclate performance.80 Test results of the recyclate compared to un-cross-linked LDPE and unprocessed XLPE [referred to as cross-linked linear low-density polyethylene (XLLDPE)] as controls are shown in Figure 8A-C. Because the recyclate has a degree of cross-linking between those of the LDPE and XLLDPE, one may expect the recyclate to exhibit behavior between those of the LDPE and XLLDPE; this expected behavior is demonstrated in the parallel plate and torque rheology experiments. Conversely, the stress–strain curves show recyclate properties that are outside the ranges of either control, which suggests that the de-cross-linked recyclate is more branched, and with a deteriorated backbone, than the starting thermoplastic. Thermal properties of the recyclate [specifically, Tm, thermal decomposition temperature (Td), and crystallization temperature] were impacted significantly less than tensile properties, similar to the mechanical recyclate discussed in the previous section. Together, these results provide a detailed picture of the impacts of the de-cross-linking process on the chain architecture and macromolecular structure and are generally representative of other recycling studies, such as those that employ ultrasonic and critical fluid de-cross-linking techniques.81,85 Even in a de-cross-linking study that showed reduced gel content to 0%, the tensile and rheological properties of the de-cross-linked XLPO did not match those of thermoplastic PO, further emphasizing the impact of de-cross-linking strategies on molecular architecture and therefore also crystallinity.83 Future studies should investigate how these changes impact the ability of the de-cross-linked XLPOs to be successfully re-cross-linked in a closed-loop recycling approach, and if possible, how the properties of the recycled XLPOs compare to those of virgin materials.\n\n5B. Recycling Thermosets into Oligomers and Small Molecules\n\nPyrolysis is a compelling route to handle mixed plastics or difficult-to-recycle materials at relatively high temperatures.65 Plastics waste pyrolysis primarily yields liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons, char, and wax, and the distribution of products depends on operating conditions such as temperature, pressure, catalyst choice, type of feedstock, and reactor design.97 The generation of syngas (a mixture of H2 and CO) from pyrolysis is also a focus of current research because syngas is a valuable intermediate in the synthesis of numerous industrial chemicals, ranging from liquid fuels and lubricants to alcohols, aldehydes, olefins, and ammonia.98 Yet thus far, there has been little research on syngas production from XLPO pyrolysis. In one study, Singh et al. used pyrolysis and CO2-assisted gasification (performed at 900 °C, with syngas yields of 80 and 250 wt % for pyrolysis and gasification, respectively, wherein the gasification yield is >100% because the yield is calculated on an XLPO-basis, but the CO2 also reacts to produce syngas) of XLPE to generate syngas with a similar energy heating value to natural gas.87 More work is needed to understand the kinetics and transport phenomena associated with these processes in large-scale reactors.87\n\nCatalytic approaches, such as catalytic pyrolysis, also have been considered for the recycling of XLPOs, as the leveraging of catalysts typically enables lower operating temperatures and results in liquid products.88 For example, Straka et al. investigated the catalytic pyrolysis of XLPE from cable and pipe manufacturing scraps with Ru-based catalysts at 450–470 °C.88 The process achieved an 87–91 wt % yield of hydrocarbon oil, a possible intermediate to synthesize value-added products such as solvents, industrial oils, lubricants, and fuels.88 Thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry techniques have been used to illuminate the consequences of cross-linking degree on the pyrolytic decomposition behavior of peroxide-cross-linked XLPE, both in the presence and absence of a typical fluid cracking zeolite catalyst.89 The inclusion of a catalyst enabled a ∼60 °C decrease in pyrolysis temperature, but the catalyzed process was more sensitive to the degree of cross-linking, with higher operating temperatures required for increased degrees of cross-linking–as the cross-linked matrix was suggested to hinder the mobility of PE chains and hence the interaction with the catalyst’s active sites.89 Future efforts are appropriate to determine the catalyst’s effect on deconstruction yields and product distributions, and there is a significant opportunity to leverage other catalytic deconstruction approaches (e.g., hydrocracking, hydrogenolysis) to recycle XLPO.\n\nOther advanced recycling technologies, such as hydrothermal and solvothermal liquefaction that run at high temperatures and pressures in the presence of water and organic solvents, respectively, can depolymerize XLPOs and yield monomers, platform chemicals, or fuel oil.99 Liu et al. investigated the depolymerization of LLDPE and XLPE from cable waste in water, acetone, and methanol under liquefaction conditions with the resulting product streams containing gas, oil, and solid fractions.99 Acetone liquefication at 350 °C for 90 min (optimal performance conditions) achieved a conversion of 75%, oil yield of 39%, energy recovery of 40%, and higher heating values of 44 MJ/kg for the oil samples, along with a lower-boiling-range molecular distribution.99 The oil fraction contained alkanes and alkenes within carbon ranges of C14 to C31 and C16 to C21, respectively.99 Although the study did not include a detailed compositional analysis of the gas phase, it is expected that this product stream mostly would include short alkanes and alkenes because of the lack of selectivity of random chain scission. Liquefaction is a promising strategy to transform spent XLPOs into valuable chemicals/fuels at the end of its first materials lifecycle; however, future work is necessary to optimize the process to reduce reaction temperatures/times and selectively tune mixtures for specific applications.\n\nMost of the above approaches are still in their experimental stage and have been validated only at laboratory scale. The petrochemical industry is investigating the pyrolysis of XLPO into fuel as the most feasible, large-scale, XLPO advanced recycling technique, and preliminary results suggest that the product of pyrolysis-treated XLPE is a suitable cracker feedstock to make new PE.100 To realize this technology at scale, it is important to streamline the fragmented XLPO waste collection process and supply chain. Furthermore, detailed TEA/LCA of the advanced recycling methods would be beneficial to identify the most promising approaches, highlight the remaining challenges, and evaluate industrial scalability.\n\n6. Redesigning XLPOs with Dynamic Covalent Chemistries\n\nIt remains critical to develop sustainable end-of-life solutions for the XLPOs already produced, but inherent difficulties in reprocessing will continue to be a challenge for XLPOs. Thus, there is an opportunity to redesign the next generation of XLPOs with end-of-life options in mind (i.e., “recyclable-by-design”). Recyclable-by-design polymers can be achieved through the incorporation of dynamic covalent chemistries in which traditional covalent cross-links are replaced with reprocessable bonds (i.e., those that can exchange or disassociate under certain stimuli, such as heat, light, pH, or solvent). These dynamic covalent chemistries include covalent adaptive networks (CANs), dissociative reactive networks, and vitrimers (i.e., a specific set of CANs in which bonds exchange under a heat stimulus without an intermediate state of disconnection).101,102 There are many proposed dynamic covalent chemistries with great potential for reprocessability that have been the subject of several recent reviews,101,103,104 including one specifically focused on PO vitrimers by Ahmadi et al.105 In this section, the most common dynamic chemistries that have been applied to POs (shown in Figure 9) and key considerations for success on an industrial scale are highlighted. Dynamic covalent chemistry-based POs are promising alternatives to XLPOs, yet dynamic covalent chemistry is a relatively new arena for this application. Thus, it is important to note that more study is required, particularly concerning material longevity, before dynamic covalent chemistries can be implemented in XLPO-related spaces, as discussed below.\n\nIn addition to the dynamic covalent chemistries shown in Figure 9, another option to redesign XLPOs for circularity is to substitute thermoplastic POs for XLPOs when possible. For example, Green et al. completed several studies on the substitution of a blend of slow-crystallized thermoplastic PEs for XLPEs in cable insulations.112 These blends have acceptable electrical properties (e.g., low dielectric loss), decent thermal properties (e.g., Tm ∼ 130 °C), and sufficient reprocessability, as the blends are not cross-linked.112 Others have investigated XLPO alternatives such as thermoplastic PE–PP copolymer blends that form physical cross-links113 and thermoplastic PP, which was covered in a review by Li et al.114 Additional testing is required to understand whether these thermoplastic alternatives can meet all the technical specifications (e.g., mechanical properties, chemical resistance, durability) required of XLPOs for many applications. Other dynamic covalent chemistries not shown in Figure 9 that have been applied to POs are Diels–Alder and imine chemistries.115,116 Both chemistries have been more commonly applied to polyolefin-based rubbers. For example, Diels–Alder reactions have been employed after grafting maleic anhydride on the backbones of ethylene/propylene and ethylene/vinyl acetate rubbers.117 Dynamic imine bonds also have been used in ethylene/propylene rubber by first introducing aldehyde pendent groups to the chains and then adding an amine cross-linking agent.118 These chemistries exhibit excellent reprocessability, but further characterization is needed to determine important performance metrics, such as Tm and tensile properties.115,116\n\nA comparison of several important thermal and mechanical properties of PE vitrimers and commercial XLPE is shown in Table 2. In addition to the HDPE and LDPE vitrimers and properties included in this table, several studies also have applied dynamic chemistries to other POs, such as PP and LLDPE.11,119 The Tms of the dynamically cross-linked PEs are closely related to whether they have an HPDE or LDPE backbone, as the Tms of LDPE and HDPE are 95–105 and 120–140 °C, respectively.120 PP has a Tm near 165 °C, and thus, PP vitrimers generally have higher Tms than PE vitrimers.120 For instance, Kar et al. synthesized transesterification-based vitrimers from HDPE and PP with Tms of 133 and 166 °C, respectively.121 Therefore, PP-based vitrimers may be a better fit than PE vitrimers for higher-temperature applications. In terms of mechanical properties, the tensile strength and elongation-at-break for many of the dynamically cross-linked chemistries are within the range of commercial XLPE. A notable exception to the mechanical property trends is silyl ether exchange-based vitrimer, in which lower tensile strengths and elongations-at-breaks are exhibited relative to the other vitrimers in Table 2. There is an opportunity to increase these metrics by adding bulkier substituents onto the silyl ether group.109 Vinylogous urethane exchange chemistries also possess lower elongations-at-break, but future work to produce HDPE vinylogous urethane exchange-based vitrimers would be expected to increase those values. It is also worth noting that XLPOs do not have a Tm, like vitrimers can, and a normal operating temperature range is provided instead. In cables, the standard operating temperature rating for XLPE is 90–105 °C, the emergency overload temperature is 130–140 °C (i.e., an elevated temperature outside of normal operation that a cable can withstand for a limited time period), and the short circuit rating (i.e., the highest temperature that a cable can withstand for ∼0.5 s) is 250 °C.122 Thus, vitrimers that would be molten by 130 °C, let alone 250 °C, would not be an acceptable substitute for cable applications with current formulations, and some amount of chemical cross-linking and/or high degrees of entanglement may be required to achieve the thermal properties necessary for cable insulation.113,123\n\nTable 2. Comparison of Critical Thermal and Mechanical Properties of XLPE vs Dynamically Cross-linked PE.\n\nDynamic Chemistry Type of PE Tm (°C) Tensile Strength (MPa) Elongation-at-Break (%) Transesterification106,121,124 HDPE/LDPE 128–133/105 17–21/16–20 620–710/400 Disulfide Exchange107,123 HDPE/LDPE 130/106 Not reported Not reported Boronic Ester Exchange102,111,125 HDPE 124–128 15–27 436–675 Silyl Ether Exchange109,126 PE-HEMAa 72 3 250 Siloxane Exchange108 HDPE 127 19–20 380–400 Vinylogous Urethane Exchange110 LDPE 97–110 16–17 85–105 Commercial XLPE122 LDPE 90–105b 16–22 350–550\n\nThe critical properties that recyclable-by-design POs must meet to be commercially viable as XLPO substitutes ultimately depend on the application. These use case-specific performance properties include thermal stability, electrical and chemical resistance, weatherability, and durability. Silyl ether/siloxane exchange chemistry has been reported as the most thermally stable dynamic cross-linker (Td,5 = 427 °C), and thus, is of particular interest for cable applications.108,109 It is also worth noting that siloxane chemistry is the most chemically similar to Si-XLPE. Therefore, siloxane chemistry may have the potential to perform the closest to Si-XLPE, which makes siloxane vitrimers promising for traditional Si-XLPE applications, such as low-voltage cables and pipes. Additionally, impact strength, stress-crack resistance, and electrical and chemical resistance are key XLPO metrics that have not been broadly characterized for dynamically cross-linked POs germane to cables. An example of the type of electrical testing required for cables is the conduction of breakdown voltage tests on thin films or mini cables to assess dielectric strength, as was done by Green et al.112 Breakdown testing in this study demonstrated that their recyclable-by-design formulations outperformed XLPE and LDPE controls.112 Moreover, many applications for XLPOs are exposed to a variety of elements (e.g., UV radiation, water, wind) and are expected to last decades. Industrial characterization commonly determines the durability and weatherability of XLPO formulations with accelerated aging tests, and these tests are necessary to further the translation of dynamic covalent chemistry research efforts.127\n\nThe scalability of initial processing approaches and retention of thermomechanical properties after multiple reprocessing cycles are important factors in determining the industrial feasibility of recyclable-by-design chemistries. Traditional XLPOs generally are compounded via extrusion, and therefore, many of the previously mentioned studies implemented reactive extrusion synthesis strategies that are expected to be economically scalable and feasible by leveraging existing industrial extrusion systems.102,106,108,110,111,121,125,126 Rheological investigations or the common industrial metric, MFI, can provide further insight into the processability of dynamically cross-linked PO formulations. Additionally, curing methods/times and any other processing steps required must be taken into consideration when evaluating the scalability of these chemistries. To demonstrate reprocessability, the dynamic cross-linked POs must retain mechanical properties over at least three reprocessing cycles. For instance, Tellers et al. synthesized LDPE vinylogous urethane-based vitrimers that exhibited >80% retention of tensile strength after four cycles of reprocessing.110 It is also of critical importance to consider the potential trade-offs between fast reprocessing and performance properties, as materials with faster stress relaxation times may display larger creep.103 Dynamic covalent chemistries with lower activation energies (Eas) will be easier to reprocess but less creep resistant, which can worsen lifetime material performance.103 To improve creep resistance, one strategy is to increase Ea; however, if the vitrimer’s Ea is too high, a catalyst may be necessary or the reprocessing conditions may become too costly.103 Of the chemistries described in this section, boronic ester exchange has the lowest Ea of ∼16 kJ/mol, whereas the rest of the chemistries (other than silyl ether exchange, which was not reported) have Eas > 100 kJ/mol.102,107,108,110,121,126 Other than raising the Ea, the introduction of a level of permanent cross-linking in addition to dynamic cross-linking is highly effective at reducing creep and retaining reprocessability.103,128 For example, with the incorporation of 40 mol % permanent cross-links into a disulfide-based vitrimer, creep resistance was reduced by ≥65%, and reprocessability was maintained.128 Creep is also highly temperature dependent, as demonstrated by disulfide-based CANs synthesized by Bin Rusayyis et al.123 The CANs exhibited excellent creep resistance at 70 °C (0.75% creep strain after ∼14 h subjected to continuous 3.0 kPa stress) but significantly lower creep resistance at 90 °C (∼7.1% creep strain under the same 3.0 kPa stress).123 Overcoming creep resistance continues to be a challenge for the commercial implementation of dynamic covalent chemistries, and thus, future research is needed to identify those chemistries best suited to balance performance and (re)processability for XLPO applications.\n\nAlong with balancing (re)processing and creep resistance, there are other remaining concerns before these chemistries can be translated to commercial scales. Silyl ethers and boronic esters are susceptible to irreversible hydrolysis when exposed to heat and water.107,108 Boronic ester, disulfide, and dynamic vinylogous urethane bonds are susceptible to oxidation, and thus premature exchange, which limits robustness.103,104 Transesterification and silyl ether/siloxane exchange chemistries can have high costs, along with potential leaching and corrosion concerns associated with catalysts.103,104 To better understand and overcome these remaining challenges, further characterization, in particular for longevity and application-specific properties, is required. As previously mentioned, introducing some amount of permanent cross-links and/or physical cross-links into dynamically cross-linking applications may be necessary to balance performance properties and recyclability.113,123 Furthermore, most of the research to date has focused on the introduction of dynamic cross-links to upcycle plastics waste and has compared the properties to thermoplastic POs but not XLPOs. One exception is the study by Fenimore et al. on disulfide exchange-based POs directly compared PO vitrimer properties to those of analogous XLPOs.107 It was found that the LDPE vitrimers had similar levels of cross-linking to traditional LDPE-based XLPE and that the vitrimers could be formulated to have similar thermomechanical properties to virgin XLPE (specifically for elastic storage modulus (E’) rubbery plateaus of 0.52 vs 0.55 MPa for vitrimers and XLPE, respectively).107 Although challenges remain, this study is an example of the type of direct comparison to traditional XLPOs useful in further studies to assess the promise of dynamic cross-linked materials. Finally, LCA also is needed to determine whether these chemistries lead to a reduction in environmental impacts relative to traditional XLPOs.\n\n7. Outlook: Remaining Challenges and Directions for Future Research\n\nThere are many promising research directions for translating the work done on thermoplastic POs to XLPOs. In particular, a number of catalytic and pyrolysis strategies have been successfully applied to thermoplastic POs, as described in recent reviews.129,130 For instance, several catalysts have been identified to cleave the C–C bonds in POs to yield liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons.131−134 Hancock et al. used Ru nanoparticles on a carbon catalyst to convert PE into liquid alkanes under relatively mild reaction conditions (200–250 °C, 20–50 bar H2).134 Wang et al. converted LDPE to diesel, wax, and lubricants over a Ru supported on tungstated zirconia catalyst (250 °C, 50 bar H2 for 2h).132 In another example, Liu et al. leveraged the synergistic effects between POs and biomass in a co-pyrolysis process to enhance the desired product yield (e.g., syngas).135 Biological deconstruction is also a promising advanced plastics recycling option that is energy-efficient and highly selective.130 For instance, Sowmya et al. isolated the fungus Penicillium simplicissimum from a local dumpsite to biodegrade PE, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy confirmed the formation of aromatic and alkene protons, groups absent from the starting PE.136 Although biological deconstruction has not been studied on XLPOs to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is an opportunity to examine whether any of the previously identified thermoplastic PO degradation enzymes and microorganisms also can act on XLPO substrates.136,137\n\nOpportunities also exist for the translation of other areas of materials research to XLPOs, such as functionalization, devulcanization, and compatibilization. Learnings can be applied from other cross-linked systems, in particular vulcanized rubbers, to XLPOs and vice versa. A number of devulcanization methods have been probed, especially in the context of waste tire rubber, which could provide insight into XLPO de-cross-linking.138 Compatibilization has been investigated to improve the adhesion of rubber wastes in blends to improve the overall performance properties of the recycled material, an approach that could be applied to the XLPO blends discussed in Section 4.139 Moreover, PO functionalization research can be applied to XLPOs. Maleic anhydride grafting is the most common strategy to functionalize C–H groups, but there has been a growing interest to activate C–H bonds through other means, resulting in the selective conversion of C–H bonds to bonds such as C–C, C–N, C–B, and C–S, as reviewed by Williamson et al.140 POs also have been functionalized by the introduction of in-chain double bonds via dehydrogenation or by oxidation.141 These valorization approaches open the door for other chemistries to be harnessed to broaden the scope for recyclable-by-design XLPOs or to functionalize ground XLPOs for higher-value applications. In short, a considerable number of opportunities exist by applying adjacent areas of materials research to XLPOs.\n\nManufacturing steps, such as cross-linking and curing can consume considerable energy, release undesired byproducts from the decomposition of organic peroxides, and contribute significantly to the overall environmental impact of an XLPO product.142 For example, manufacturing emits >2x more GHG emissions vs use for cables, as discussed in Section 3.47 In recognition of this point, there has been recent work to reduce curing times/temperatures and choose synthesis procedures that avoid the generation of toxic byproducts.142 There are additional opportunities to increase circularity in the production of XLPOs with regards to material inputs, such as upcycling thermoplastic PO waste to XLPO (i.e., substituting recycled POs as a material input for virgin PE) or incorporating biobased cross-linkers. For instance, Fenimore et al. employed post-consumer recycled (PCR) LDPE and HDPE to synthesize PE vitrimers,107 and Dey et al. used biobased cross-linkers to synthesize PCR–PP vitrimers with 90% retention of mechanical properties after five reprocessing cycles.143 Biobased peroxides also have been developed for the formulation of industrial hardeners, although they have not yet been applied to XLPO systems.144 The effects of the PCR purity and biobased cross-linkers on the long-term properties of XLPOs require additional evaluation, and future research should investigate if other steps within XLPO manufacturing (e.g., transportation, formulation design, compounding, product distribution) can be streamlined to further alleviate environmental impacts.\n\nA remaining challenge for XLPO circularity is the impact of additives on the strategies discussed throughout this review. Common additives used in XLPOs include stabilizers such as antioxidants, color concentrates, flame retardants, and carbon black (for conductivity or UV-weathering resistance).145−147 Additive packages vary from product to product, which adds another layer of uncertainty to XLPO circularity solutions, and the specific additives present have been shown to have significant consequences for thermoplastic PO recycling, especially for catalytic approaches. For instance, phenolic antioxidants reduced catalyst activity by 50% in the deconstruction of HDPE employing a Pt/WO3/ZrO2 catalyst system.148 Another example that highlights the impact of additives on the ultimate recyclate value is the difference in the price of natural vs colored mechanically recycled HDPE ($0.75 vs $0.23/lb for natural and colored HDPE, respectively in the United States in 2021).149 As additives are critical for the processing and performance of commercial XLPOs, it is vital to investigate the impact of additives on proposed recycling processes and develop solutions in the case that they interfere. Such remedies could include preprocessing steps to strip additives out of XLPOs, screening process conditions for robustness, or developing additive formulations more tolerable to the chosen circularity method.\n\nBalancing performance, cost, scalability, and circularity poses a major challenge in achieving complete circularity for XLPOs. Many XLPO applications necessitate high-purity materials to achieve extended lifecycles, which will have a large effect on the choice of circularity strategy. For instance, using upcycled POs in XLPO formulations could improve circularity and reduce costs but likely would demand stringent purity standards, or robust formulations and applications capable of handling any impurities to achieve the required performance. Furthermore, sustainable solutions will need to be either cost-competitive or subsidized with current methods to break into the market. Inevitably, there will be no one-size-fits-all remedy to improving the circularity of XLPO. Nonetheless, by employing a combination of circularity strategies discussed in this review and those yet to be uncovered, a significant opportunity exists to markedly improve the lifecycle circularity of both current and future XLPOs.\n\n8. Conclusions\n\nThe circularity of XLPOs has been relatively overlooked by the sustainable materials research community, yet numerous approaches present opportunities to enhance the circularity of this substantial and growing plastics waste stream. This review has highlighted solutions spanning the materials lifecycle, such as using biobased feedstocks, extending materials longevity, enabling circularity through mechanical and advanced recycling methods, and redesigning chemistries for circularity in next-generation XLPOs. Recent advances in plastics design, especially those targeting thermoplastic POs, offer promising future research directions for increased XLPO sustainability, but challenges remain to balance performance, cost, scalability, and circularity. Overall, there are several opportunities to transition from the current linear lifecycle of XLPOs to a more circular lifecycle and from the laboratory to industrial application.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nA.J.S. and T.H.E. would like to thank the National Science Foundation (NSF) Growing Convergence Research program (NSF GCR CMMI 1934887) in Materials Life Cycle Management for support during the writing of this work.

      "# [Furandicarboxylic Acid Dimethyl Ester (FDME) Manufacturers](https://www.sugar-energy.com/product/2-5-furandicarboxylicacid-dimethyl-ester.html)\n1. What is FDME and How is it Produced?\n\n2,5-Furandicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester (FDME) is a vital bio-based chemical intermediate that has attracted significant interest in various industries due to its renewable origins and wide range of applications. FDME is produced through the oxidation and esterification of hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), a compound derived from biomass sources like fructose and glucose. This production process makes FDME part of the broader trend towards utilizing renewable resources in chemical manufacturing, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and contributing to the sustainability of industrial processes.\n\nThe molecular structure of FDME, denoted by the formula C8H8O5, features two ester groups attached to a furan ring. This structure imparts FDME with unique chemical properties, such as its ability to easily participate in polymerization reactions. FDME has a molecular weight of 184.15 g/mol, and its physical properties further reflect its stability and usefulness in various chemical reactions. It has a melting point of 117.6℃, indicating its solid state at room temperature, and a boiling point of 270.9℃ at 760 mmHg, showing its stability under standard atmospheric conditions. Additionally, FDME has a relative density of 1.244 g/cm³, which is typical for organic esters and contributes to its ease of handling and storage.\n\nOne of the key advantages of FDME is its stability, particularly when stored in sealed containers at room temperature. This stability is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the chemical during transportation and storage, making FDME a reliable raw material for various industrial processes. The production of FDME is a relatively straightforward process, often involving catalytic oxidation of HMF followed by esterification. This process not only yields a high-purity product but also aligns with the principles of green chemistry, reducing the environmental impact of chemical production. As industries continue to seek sustainable and renewable alternatives to petrochemical-based products, FDME stands out as a promising candidate for a wide range of applications.\n\n2. Applications of FDME in Polymer Synthesis\n\nThe most prominent application of FDME lies in the polymer industry, where it is used as a key monomer in the production of polyethylene furanoate (PEF). PEF is a biobased polyester that is increasingly seen as a sustainable alternative to traditional petroleum-based plastics like polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The production of PEF involves the transesterification polymerization of FDME with ethylene glycol, resulting in a polyester that offers several advantages over PET. These advantages include superior barrier properties against gases like oxygen and carbon dioxide, which makes PEF an ideal material for packaging applications, particularly in the food and beverage industry.\n\nThe use of FDME in PEF production is not only beneficial from a performance standpoint but also from an environmental perspective. PEF is derived entirely from renewable resources, which significantly reduces the carbon footprint associated with its production compared to traditional plastics. Additionally, PEF is fully recyclable, aligning with the global push towards a circular economy where materials are reused and recycled rather than disposed of. The incorporation of FDME into PEF also enhances the material's mechanical properties, such as tensile strength and thermal stability, making it suitable for a wide range of applications beyond packaging, including textiles and automotive parts.\n\nBeyond its use in PEF, FDME is also being explored for the production of other types of polymers. Researchers are investigating the potential of FDME to create new classes of polyesters and polyamides, which could offer further improvements in properties such as biodegradability, strength, and resistance to heat and chemicals. These developments highlight the versatility of FDME as a monomer and its potential to drive innovation in the polymer industry. As demand for sustainable materials continues to grow, FDME is poised to play a critical role in the development of next-generation polymers that meet the needs of both industry and the environment."
