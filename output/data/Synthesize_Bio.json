Of this data, less than 2% correspond to bio-based plastics. Currently, polymers, including elastomers, are non-recyclable and come from non-renewable sources. Additionally, most elastomers are thermosets, making them complex to recycle and reuse. It takes hundreds to thousands of years to decompose or biodegrade, contributing to plastic waste accumulation, nano and microplastic formation, and environmental pollution. Due to this, the synthesis of elastomers from natural and renewable resources has attracted the attention of researchers and industries. In this review paper, new methods and strategies are proposed for the preparation of bio-based elastomers. The main goals are the advances and improvements in the synthesis, properties, and applications of bio-based elastomers from natural and industrial rubbers, polyurethanes, polyesters, and polyethers, and an approach to their circular economy and sustainability. Olefin metathesis is proposed as a novel and sustainable method for the synthesis of bio-based elastomers, which allows for the depolymerization or degradation of rubbers with the use of essential oils, terpenes, fatty acids, and fatty alcohols from natural resources such as chain transfer agents (CTA) or donors of the terminal groups in the main chain, which allow for control of the molecular weights and functional groups, obtaining new compounds, oligomers, and bio-based elastomers with an added value for the application of new polymers and materials. This tendency contributes to the development of bio-based elastomers that can reduce carbon emissions, avoid cross-contamination from fossil fuels, and obtain a greener material with biodegradable and/or compostable behavior.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nAccording to PlasticsEurope AISBL©, the global plastics production data in 2021 was 390.7 Mt, and in 2022, it was 400.3 Mt; where Africa produced 9%, Europe 14%, America 21%, and Asia 56%, with China being the country with the highest plastic production, with about 32%. These include conventional plastics and thermoplastics such as PET, PE, PP, PVC, PS, and PU, as well as some thermoset plastics [1,2]. The production and consumption of conventional plastics and polymers show an increase year after year.\n\nElastomers, a category of polymers characterized by high elasticity and viscoelasticity, possess the ability to revert to their initial form after undergoing stretching or deformation and are known for their outstanding resistance to abrasion, tearing, and impact. Elastomers find applicability across various industries, including automotive, aerospace, construction, electronics, healthcare, and biomedicine [3,4,5]. There are two types of elastomers: thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) (e.g., thermoplastic polyester elastomers, thermoplastic polyether elastomers, thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer, thermoplastic polyamide elastomers) and thermosets (e.g., vulcanized natural or industrial rubber, epoxidized natural rubber, cross-linked polyester elastomers, cross-linked polyurethane elastomers). Thermoset elastomers predominate in production and consumption. The elastomer industry encompasses three primary kinds: rubber, plastic, and gel. Rubber elastomers, crafted from natural or synthetic polymers, are renowned for their remarkable elasticity and durability. In contrast, plastic elastomers or TPE represent a fusion of rubber and plastic, delivering a harmonious combination of flexibility and rigidity [3,4]. Currently, polymers, including elastomers, are non-recyclable and come from non-renewable sources [5]. Due to this, the synthesis of elastomers from natural and renewable resources has attracted the attention of researchers and industries.\n\nBy the definition provided by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the term “bio-based” refers to “materials that are either entirely or partially composed of biological products originating from biomass. This encompasses materials derived from plant, animal, marine, or forestry sources” [6]. In environmental terms, bio-based polymers possess the capacity to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2). This reduction occurs because, during the synthesis process using natural resources as raw materials, plants absorb atmospheric CO2 for their growth. As a result, bio-based polymers contribute to a net reduction in atmospheric CO2 levels [7].\n\nA bio-based polymer originates from natural and/or renewable sources, typically derived from biomass, and is recognized for its environmentally friendly characteristics. It exhibits a shorter environmental decomposition time, influenced by both abiotic and biotic factors [8]. This polymer or elastomer may consist partially or entirely of bio-based components, such as a mixture, composite, copolymer, graft, additive, or by employing natural monomers in the synthesis (biopolymer). A higher percentage of bio-based content indicates a more sustainable material, often associated with biodegradable and compostable behavior [9].\n\nIn this review paper, new methods and strategies are proposed for the preparation of bio-based elastomers. The main goals are the advances and improvements in the synthesis, properties, and applications of bio-based elastomers from natural and industrial rubbers, polyurethanes, polyesters, and polyethers, and an approach to their circular economy and sustainability.\n\n2. Bio-Based Elastomers from Natural and Industrial Rubbers\n\nSynthetic elastomers used in tires are derived mainly from petrochemicals, which are not sustainable. Recently, renewable resources have been used to produce several bio-based elastomers. For example, itaconic acid is a renewable resource from fermentations produced by microorganisms, especially Aspergillus terreus; it is used as a bio-based building block. Lei et al. have manufactured silica/poly(di-n-butyl itaconate-co-butadiene) (20–80% butadiene) nanocomposite-based green tires that are prepared by redox-initiated copolymerization of di-n-butyl itaconate and butadiene. These bio-based elastomers have excellent wet skid and low roll resistances, respectively [10].\n\nIt is essential to say that not all bio-based polymers are biodegradable (capability of being degraded by biological activity); for example, bio-based plastics such as the bio-polyethylene (Bio-PE) and Bio-poly(ethylene terephthalate) (Bio-PET) that use bioethanol from sugarcane (by the fermentation of glucose) [8,11,12], starch-based crops produced by wet-mill processing as raw material [13,14], the chemical modification of natural rubbers (NR) that have been modified to improve their properties and application, as well as the epoxidized NR under strain-induced crystallization (SIC) [15], are all non-biodegradable polymers.\n\nIn particular, natural rubber (NR) is a polymer composed of isoprene units linked to form double bonds with a cis configuration (99.9%, cis-1,4-polyisoprene) when extracted from the latex of the Hevea brasiliensis trees and Parthenium argentatum woody shrub [16,17,18]; trans configuration extracted from the latex of the Palaquium gutta trees (trans-1,4-polyisoprene) [17,19]; and cis/trans isomer mixtures extracted from the latex of the Manilkara zapota trees [17,18,20]. NR (99.9%, cis-1,4-polyisoprene) is widely employed in the fabrication of tires, construction industries, and biomedical applications. NR possesses unique properties due to its low modulus and high elasticity and can rapidly recover its original state upon release of external stress [18].\n\nBased on reprocessability, bio-based NR can introduce bio-based chemically crosslinked thermoplastics. The bio-based chemically crosslinked/cross-linkable elastomers (CCEs) from NR and synthetic elastomers derived from bio-based monomers have been reported. CCEs possess better resilience and higher operating temperatures due to covalent three-dimensional (3D) networks [4,21,22,23,24]. Several dicarboxylic acids are used as green crosslinkers to react with ENR (Figure 1).\n\nSrirachya et al. investigated a crosslinking agent for ENR. They demonstrated that it was possible to crosslink ENR with maleic anhydride thermally; no additional catalysts were needed [21]. Riyajan et al. studied the influence on the physical properties, including the swelling behavior, tensile strength, and thermal stability of the vulcanization of ENR latex using a terephthalic acid crosslinker. It was observed that the ENR crosslinked with terephthalic acid depolymerized in natural soil compared to natural rubber vulcanized with sulfur [22]. Pire et al. crosslinked the epoxidized NR by dodecanedioic acid with 1,2-dimethylimidazole. The authors explain that 1,2-Dimethylimidazole accelerates crosslinking, and imidazolium dicarboxylate species are formed to reach the less substituted side of the epoxy site [23,24]. Generally, the ENR crosslinked with dicarboxylic acids improves mechanical properties compared to those vulcanized by sulfur because carbon–oxygen crosslinks possess higher bond energies than sulfur ones [25].\n\nBio-Based Elastomers with Essential Oils\n\nCitric fruits (Rutaceae family) are the most commonly cultivated and consumed fruits worldwide. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), global overall citrus fruit production in 2020 was around 158.49 million metric tons [26]. The major citrus-producing countries include China, Brazil, and the United States of America. Approximately 40–60% of the fruit is discarded as waste upon consumption. In general, the industrial production of citrus fruits generates 110–120 million tons of citrus waste yearly, such as peels (flavedo and albedo), seeds, and pomace [27,28,29]. It is possible to extract limonoids, essential oils, phenols, flavonoids, carotenoids, and cellulose from these wastes. Significantly, essential oils can be obtained from the peels and seeds of citrus fruit waste, and they are considered potent bio-resource materials for various uses in the food and non-food sectors. Also, these substances are considered plant-based natural products consisting of volatile and aromatic compounds present at low concentrations. Essential oils are compounds made up of isoprene units attached to 10-carbon and 15-carbon structures known as monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids, respectively. These compounds are typically found in the oil sacs of citrus peels and cuticles, as shown in Figure 2 [29].\n\nEssential oils or citrus oils have the characteristics of being low in toxicity, inexpensive, and can be obtained by several extraction techniques such as steam distillation and solvent extraction [30,31]. They are mainly used in the pharmaceutical industry to obtain active ingredients, the cosmetics industry in perfume production, food for flavoring preparation, and the chemical industry in packaging materials production, among others. In the bio-based elastomers elaboration, essential oils have significantly modified natural rubber and some industrial elastomers.\n\nTerpenes have emerged as viable candidates to serve as monomers in bio-based elastomer production. The most common type of bio-based elastomers from terpene is β-Myrcene, which is extracted by hops, bay, and thyme oils or can be obtained by pyrolysis from β-pinene [32]. β-Myrcene has two conjugated double bonds in its structure and can be polymerized similarly to its isoprene via anionic, free-radical, coordination, and cationic reactions. These polymerization reactions can have several possibilities for 1,2-; 3,4-; and 1,4-cis or trans myrcene isomerization to obtain elastomers with similar mechanical and thermal properties to NR (Hevea brasiliensis, Palaquium gutta, and Manilkara zapota trees). In 1960, Marvel studied the polymerization of myrcene by Ziegler-type catalysts (triisobutylaluminum, TiCl4, and vanadium trichloride) with a predominantly 1,4 arrangement of the diene unit in the polymer chain, with conversions of 80% of the polymyrcene [33].\n\nIt has been reported the stereoselective polymerization of β-myrcene and β-ocimene and their copolymerization with styrene using homogeneous titanium catalysts activated by MAO (methylaluminoxane) showing different stereoselectivity, for example, 1,4-trans-poly myrcene (92%) and its copolymerization with styrene using dichloro{1,4-dithiabutanediyl-2,2′-bis(4,6-di-tert-butyl-phenyl)}titanium complex, and 1,4-cis-poly myrcene (92%) in the presence of Ti(η5-C5H5)-(η2-2,2′-methylene bis(6-tert-butyl-4-methylphenoxo))Cl complexes were obtained. Also, these catalysts were used in the β-ocimene polymerization. Other terpenes are ocimene (which can be produced from the thermal cracking of β-pinene) and farnesene (which can be found in nature like α- and β-isomers); however, farnesene can be obtained through the fermentation of sugar feedstocks [34]. When using the last catalysts with ocimene and a high temperature (70 °C), the 1,4-trans polymer (70%) is formed, while at a lower temperature, an isotactic poly-1,2-ocimene (>99%) was obtained [35].\n\nOn the other hand, Lamparelli et al. have reported that the soluble heterocomplexes consisting of sodium hydride in combination with trialkylaluminium derivatives have been used as anionic initiating in the polymerization of myrcene and its copolymerization with styrene and isoprene [36,37].\n\nIt is well known that NR and industrial elastomers such as polybutadiene (PB) and poly(styrene-butadiene-styrene) (SBS) are materials used in the production of tires, adhesives, and rubber bands, among others. The properties of elastomers are amorphous polymers found above their glass transition (Tg), which explains their deformability. Authors have demonstrated that modified elastomers such as NR are proposed to expand the application [38]. It has been reported that d-limonene, β-pinene terpenes, some menthol, β-citronellol, and citral terpenoids, mainly extracted from turpentine, lemon, mandarin, orange, mint, citronella oils, citral, and other terpenes, contain in their structure carbon–carbon double bonds, and they are used in the natural rubber modification via metathesis reactions [39,40,41,42].\n\nSome reports have shown that d-limonene, considered the most abundant component in mandarin (74%), lemon (87%), and orange (97%) essential oils, is used as a chain transfer agent (CTA) in the cross-metathesis reaction of NR in the presence of ruthenium carbene-alkylidene and vinylidene complex catalysts (Figure 3). These two classes of catalysts tolerate a wide range of functional groups (e.g., amino, carboxyl, acetoxy, ester, hydroxy, fluorine, and chlorine), and they are active with more sterically hindered substrates such as natural rubber [43,44,45].\n\nNR modification with limonene and mandarin oils via cross-metathesis allows the synthesis of mono-terminated or terpene-terminated oligomers (Table 1) with low molecular weight around Mn × 102 g × mol−1 and yields of 80% when the catalyst Grubbs-2 is used (entries 1 and 3). In contrast, with Grubbs-1 and vinylidene-II and -III catalysts [40], the molecular weights of terpene-terminated oligomers are around Mn × 104 g × mol−1 with yields ranging from 70–96% (entries 2, 7, and 8).\n\nIt essential to note that Ru-vinylidene catalysts (I) showed higher catalytic efficiency in the cross-metathesis reaction of NR with d-limonene and mandarin oil to give terpene-terminated oligomers with Mn × 103 g × mol−1 (entry 6) [41] Also, authors reported that cross-metathesis reaction can control the molecular weight by the NR/CTA molar ratio (entries 3–5). A similar approach, bio-based NR, was obtained using lemon, orange, and β-pinene terpene as CTAs [39,40,41,46]. This easily accessible class of Ru complexes showed high thermal stability combined with good activity in the NR cross-metathesis.\n\nTheoretical studies have shown that trisubstituted internal olefin (NR, d-limonene) is more difficult to break the C=C bond than one disubstituted unsaturation of the cis-polybutadiene and other polyalkenamers due to the steric hindrance of the methyl group of the NR, which makes difficult the coordination between the M=C complex and C=C double bond of isoprene [47]. For example, this has been confirmed by experimental studies in the cross-metathesis of SBS synthetic elastomer using d-limonene and orange oil as CTA. The SBS-terpene elastomer modification in the presence of ruthenium–vinylidene catalysts (I) and Grubbs-1 to several molar ratios [rubber]/[CTA] was accomplished.\n\n3. Bio-Based Polyurethane Elastomers\n\nThe global production of polyurethane (PU) remains between 5.3 and 5.5% compared to conventional plastics such as PET, PE, PP, PVC, and PS [1,2,8]. PU has gained much attention due to its excellent thermal, mechanical, and chemical properties, diversity in material types, and their applications. There are different types of polyurethanes, including thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPUs), thermostable polyurethanes, and elastomeric polyurethanes (EPUs). The most common thermostable polyurethanes are foams, widely used as thermal insulators; among the most common EPUs are those used as adhesives, high-performance sealants, shoe soles, paints, textile fibers, gaskets, and in the construction, furniture, medical, and automotive industries. The characteristic properties of elastomeric PU include high resistance to wear and abrasion, good cushioning capacity, good flexibility at low temperatures, high resistance to fats, oils, oxygen, and ozone, excellent elastic recovery, transparency, and adhesion [48,49,50,51].\n\nPU is synthesized by a polycondensation reaction between a diisocyanate and polyol or macrodiol with an average molecular weight in the range from 600 to 4000 g/mol, using a short-chain diol or chain extender with molecular weights in the range of 62 to 400 g/mol to increase the chain’s molecular weight and define the material’s rigidity. The polyol forms the soft and flexible segments and provides an elastomeric matrix responsible for most of the elastic properties of EPU. The diisocyanate, polyol, and diol are used at different molar ratios, and the reaction mixture will define the soft and hard segments, the type of PU, its properties, and its applications [49,52,53,54].\n\nThese three components or raw materials for the production of PU are derived from oil resources. Currently, PU is a non-recyclable polymer that comes from non-renewable sources. It can also be a thermoplastic PU, which makes it a complex material to recycle and reuse; moreover, there is no adequate waste management. It takes hundreds to thousands of years to decompose or biodegrade, contributing to plastic waste accumulation, nano and microplastic formation, and environmental pollution [55,56]. Due to this, the synthesis of PU from natural and renewable resources has attracted the attention of researchers and industries to form different types of bio-based PU [51,57,58,59]. Precisely for this study, bio-based EPU shares elastic properties like rubbers and thermoplastic polyurethane; these properties are provided mainly by the polyol from natural resources, making it ideal for different applications.\n\nDifferent diols and polyols have been used to synthesize bio-based EPUs derived from algae, plants, animals, crustaceans, grains, cereals, and fruits. Some diols and polyols are mannitol, sorbitol, xylitol, glycerol, cardol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,4-butanediol, and 1,6-hexanediol bio-based (Figure 4). Many polyols have been obtained and modified from lignin, chitin, chitosan, and cellulose (aromatic polyol) [60,61,62,63,64,65,66]. Some diols can be converted into polyols by a polycondensation reaction; for example, polyhexanediol (bio-based polyol) has been obtained from 1,6-hexanediol [62].\n\nVarious polyols have been synthesized from industrial and natural rubbers, which have elastomeric properties because they come from rubbers, such as excellent elastic recovery, low transition temperature (Tg), and flexibility at low temperatures, which will be transmitted to the polyurethane. Polyols from polybutadiene (PB), polybutadiene rubber (BR), or SBS copolymer have been synthesized. BR has repeating butadiene units, which can be trans or cis-1,4-polybutadiene and are modified with another compound or reagent with hydroxyl (-OH)-terminated groups, which are called “hydroxy-terminated polybutadiene” (HTPB), hydroxy telechelic polybutadiene or polyols; these have been obtained by different methods such as oxidation or oxidolysis [67,68], anionic polymerization [69], via copolymerization [70], via nickel catalyst [71], and by olefin metathesis [72,73]. Other polyols have been obtained from natural rubber (NR), NR comes from the rubber tree, or from its synthetic form, polyisoprene rubber (IR), which has repeating isoprene units and can be trans or cis-1,4-polyisoprene [18]. In the same way, NR is modified with another compound with -OH groups, which are called “hydroxy-terminated polyisoprene” (HTPI or HTNR) or polyols; these have been obtained by different methods such as epoxidation [74,75], anionic polymerization [76], and by olefin metathesis [42].\n\nOf the mentioned methods, obtaining polyols by olefin metathesis reaction has shown that both natural and industrial rubbers can be modified or degraded under mild conditions, at low temperatures and atmospheric pressure, in solvent-free conditions, or allowing the use of green solvents, and using fatty alcohol, terpenes, diols, or essential oils with OH groups from natural resources such as chain transfer agent CTA for the synthesis and production of bio-based elastomeric polyurethanes (Figure 5). This is a new and promising synthesis route to produce bio-based polyols for applications in engineering polymers and elastomeric materials.\n\n4. Bio-Based and Biodegradable Polyester and Polyether Elastomers\n\nSince the last decade, developing new elastomers has brought infinite possibilities using natural materials for their synthesis. This new trend has arisen due to the high demand for elastomers from the market derived from non-renewable sources, which produces a constant negative effect [4]. These effects cause a series of environmental concerns. Throughout the entire technological production process and obtaining raw materials derived from oil, endless red dots cause extensive damage to ecosystems [77,78]. This environmental issue and the long degradation time have many unprecedented negative ecological consequences.\n\nBased on those statements, the advantages of looking for new sources and routes to obtain elastomers continue to increase. Indeed, polyester and polyether arise as new sources of elastomers with many properties, starting from elasticity, which is the ability to recover the shape after a deformation [4,5]. However, to achieve this elasticity, the elastomers must have an elastomer and an elastic region over a considerable strain (Figure 6). When the elastomer has a rigid and flexible region, it is called a copolymer, and some particularities are involved in this type of material. Despite the viscoelasticity and weak inter-molecular forces, elastomers generally have low Young’s modulus but high failure strain. These peculiarities became elastomers as a tremendous and essential material for numerous applications such as aerospace, construction, automobile, and, more recently, biomedical industries [4,79,80].\n\nBased on the type of crosslinking, elastomers can be divided into main groups: the chemically crosslinked and the physically crosslinked. The last one has a more thermoplastic function, and it is named physically crosslinked thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs). It is well known that chemically crosslinked elastomers possess excellent resilience and higher operating temperatures since the covalent functionality allows the creation of 3D networks in the material. This type of elastomer is commonly known as “rubbers” and their applications will be limited depending on the additives used to obtain a particular elastomer for further engineering applications [81,82].\n\nSince natural and synthetic rubbers have a global consumption of more than 14 Mt in 2022 [73], the TPEs became more important since they possess a microphase-separated structure, avowing the use of reinforced fillers. This particularity is essential in terms of the recyclability of the material. Still, commercial synthetic elastomers are produced or obtained from fossil resources, translating into more environmental problems than natural rubbers or other elastomers. Indeed, researchers’ primary objective is to develop bio-based elastomers to reduce carbon emissions, avoid cross-contamination from fossil fuels, and obtain a greener material with biodegradable and/or compostable behavior.\n\n4.1. Generalities from Polyester and Polyether Elastomers\n\nBased on the chain chemistry of the elastomer, these materials can be divided into polyester elastomers and polyether elastomers, depending on the segment of the general formula. However, segmented copoly (ether-ester) elastomers are also included in the group of ester elastomers. Several authors reported a synthesis course in which phase separation occurs when the substituted (normally polyols) molecular weight is high enough. Then, a soft phase with a noticeable low glass transition temperature and a hard phase with a high melting point are designed [4,79]. Until now, segment modifications have started to include bio-based materials, but usually, the elements joining polyether and polyester segments could be ester, amide [83], urethane [84], and ether groups [85].\n\nIn general, these elastomers can be easily synthesized through an esterification and polycondensation process. Meanwhile, changing the ratios and varying the compounds used as hard and soft segments can improve their physical properties. These characteristics bring a thermodynamic immiscibility material in which the rigid phase is separated from the flexible segments (phase separation), and two phases are found in the material, a softer one with different glass transition and melting temperature than the rigid phase [77]. In terms of composition, the hard segments are generally aromatic polyesters, while the soft segments are aliphatic polyethers or polyesters with long chains. Some examples are found in the literature for hard segments, which include poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT), poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT), and Polyether ether ketone (PEEK) [86]. In the case of soft segments, polyol molecules such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), poly(tetramethylene glycol) (PTMG), and poly(sebacate ethylene glycol) are a few of those used in the formulation [87]. The most common strategy for synthesized and fabricated polyester and polyether elastomers is the introduction of long aliphatic flexible soft segments into the most rigid phase material. This process gives the polyester–polyether elastomers a range of unique properties, such as similar synthetic features as polyesters, but biodegradation is still missing.\n\nFor this reason, efforts to find alternatives to more environmentally friendly materials have been studied. Indeed, other polyols, such as natural and vegetal oils, glycerol and its derivatives, terpenes, and resins, synthesize copolymers to obtain excellent polyesters and polyether elastomers. The idea of producing these plastics is to proceed with linear degradation, which means that only at the surface of the material exposed to water are mass loss and dimensional reduction proportional to the surface area exposed.\n\nThis process can be enhanced if a polyester or polyether is included in the elastomer structure, increasing the mechanical properties but enhancing its performance in terms of thermal stability, chemical resistance, and structural integrity. To understand this enhanced mechanism deeply, Table 2 shows some examples of bio-based and biodegradable polyester and polyether elastomers found in the literature and their respective characteristics.\n\n4.2. Bio-Based and Biodegradable Polyester/Polyether\n\nTo understand the biggest challenges for formulating bio-based and/or biodegradable polyester/polyether elastomers, some researchers plan experimental strategies in Table 2.\n\nRemarkably, the strategies can be divided into groups depending on the bio-based or/and biodegradable source in which the monomer for polymerization is presented. Depending on the applications, different additives or rigid polymers are included to enhance their properties. Indeed, Groeneveld [88] used the exceptional characteristics of the Castor plant to extract ethoxylated oils, promising sources of mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, and penta-esters using glycerol derivates. The authors founded a technique based on two-dimensional liquid chromatography hyphenated with high-resolution mass spectrometry to obtain polyether(ethers) with polyols, which can be used as initiators for the synthesis of polyurethanes. Since the techniques are valuable for the comprehensive separation of overly complex, the uses for this type of components are variable, from coatings, adhesives, sealants, and synthetic lubricants to functional fluids in which isomers are pretty necessary.\n\nAnother example using plant-derived materials is the one presented by Martínez et al. [89], in which the use of polyterpene natural rubber from Hevea brasiliensis was implemented in a cross-metathesis reaction with α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds.\n\nAuthors claim that preparing unsaturated polyester elastomers has excellent potential as a petrochemical alternative, including in perfume, flavor, and pharmaceutical industries. These results were conclusive when novel aliphatic unsaturated esters with molecular weight values around Mw = 1912 to 3367 g/mol and yields ranging from 68 to 79% were obtained. This result is encouraging since terpenes from plant-derived can be used satisfactorily in this type of chemical reaction.\n\nSimilar to the previous results, residues from plant-based biomass rich in hemicellulose can be used to form α,ω-unsaturated polyesters and polyether. To get this, Piccini et al. [90] use a bicyclic diol 1,2-O-isopropylidene-α-D-xylofuranose D-xylose derived from the biomass and a mixture with ω-unsaturated fatty acids and alcohols, originating a promising bioplastic for sustainable packaging applications. The authors employed an acyclic diene metathesis polymerization and found a decrease in the glass transition temperatures when increasing the chain length of the additives. Moreover, after being cast into films, the elastomers displayed remarkable polyethylene-like properties with high Young modulus and elongation at break, solid yet flexible behavior, and excellent gas barrier properties, proving their uses as food packaging materials.\n\nIndeed, the uses of plant-derived materials are getting increasingly valuable, and Linh et al. [91] presented the synthesis, preparation, and properties of some polyethers from chalcones. Chalcones (or 1,3-diphenyl prop-2-en-1-one) are promising molecules with α,β-unsaturated carbonyl groups [96]. Linh et al. [91] mainly use the 4-hydroxy benzaldehyde and vanillin with p-hydroxy acetophenone to synthesize diphenol chalcone-derived monomers. The Claisen–Schmidt condensation reactions with 1,6-dibromo hexane were performed for the elastomer formulation, and a co-polyether’s materials were achieved. Even when several applications in pharmaceutical compositions, microscopy, photosensitive materials, nonlinear optical materials, and crystal display liquids are found, the authors believe that further studies in the field of photochemistry and photosensitivity need to be performed. This hypothesis was based on the TGA analyses that proved that polymer samples had good thermal stability.\n\nAnother biomass for the obtention of copolyether polyols is presented by Basterretxea et al. [77] when lignocellulosic and limonene terpenes are applied into self-condensation and polycondensation. The authors claim the preparation of ideal candidates in a great variety of polyurethane elastomers is due to the comprehensive properties and tunable crystallinity found in the materials. Since lignocellulosic materials and hemicelluloses are presented in many plant-derived materials, their uses are common in the obtention of polyester and polyether elastomers. Sousa et al. [87] use some natural sources such as ethylene glycol and 2,5-furan-dicarboxylic acid to produce the poly(ethylene 2,5-furan-dicarboxylate) and poly(ethylene glycol) elastomers by polytransesterification reaction. These furandicarboxylated copolyester/ethers are essential insights for the packaging industry since lower melting temperature and higher thermal stability were found in other investigations by Qu et al. [94] for the preparation of bio-Furan-based polyesters in food and beverage packaging, clothing, and in the car industry. One type of biomass source with lignocellulosic components in corn, and Luo et al. [93] presented the synthesis and evaluation of polyether diols-based polyurethane dispersions by a solvent-free process using poly propanediol and poly(tetramethylene ether) glycol as copolymer. The solvent-free method was enough to obtain a polyether diol-based polyurethane that can be included in textile coatings since it presents high adhesion ability and excellent softness.\n\nFinally, it is essential to consider that other renewable resources such as polylactic acid (PLA) [92] and citric acid [97] are still undergoing investigation to be considered excellent components to produce polyester and polyether elastomers. Indeed, Nagarajan et al. [92] evaluated the production of a thermoplastic copolyester elastomer using PLA and Hytrel, a commercial thermoplastic polyester elastomer, to produce a more environmentally friendly material based on the substitution of the bio-based Hytrel into several compositions with the PLA being the optimal the formulation with 70/30. Hytrel is a polyether glycol and polybutylene terephthalate elastomer, but when glycidyl methacrylate, maleic anhydride, and a melting processed reaction using ethylene butyl acrylate and ethylene methyl acrylate copolymers, some properties such as a co-continuous morphology and changes in tensile strength and modulus of the binary blends decreased depending on the content of Hytrel. However, impact toughness and a more significant stress whitening zone were observed in the impact-fractured composite surface with ethylene methylene acrylate-glycidyl methacrylate, showing better results. This result is interesting when reducing bio-based materials from non-renewable sources is included in producing sustainable copolymers for commodity and engineering applications.\n\nSimilarly, Acosta et al. [95] studied substituting or reducing a commercial greenpoxy 28 material obtained from plant and vegetable origin into a reinforced composite. The authors explain that it is possible to treat the composite to reduce its amount in the preparation of elastomers. For this, the woven jute fabric is used as reinforcement material and allyl-functionalized ditertiary amine as a curing agent and a multifunctional thiol (3-mercaptopropyl (trimethoxysilane)) as a radical photoinitiator. The authors prepared the blends using epoxy/thiol-ene photopolymerization to obtain a polyether-polythioether crosslinked co-network. The results indicate an increase of up to 50% in flexural modulus and strength concerning the non-functionalized counterparts. Also, the composites displayed higher deformation at break and toughness due to the presence of polythioether in the co-network. The prepared biocomposites could be excellent material applications in aerospace, nautical, automotive, packaging, and building industries.\n\n4.3. Advances in the Use of Bio-Based and Biodegradable Polyester and Polyether Elastomers\n\nAlthough the advances in the search for bio-based or biodegradable elastomers continue to increase, the expectations for using materials from polyester and polyether elastomers continue to be infinite. Various authors describe that polyester or polyether elastomers are excellent candidates in terms of durability, degradability, costs, and synthesis; however, many studies only focus on the chemical formulation and its characterization, and few studies explain and demonstrate with a straightforward application, concise and precise, the improvements and virtues of the new composites created. Thus, a series of articles were selected because their applicability in biomedical, sensors, reconstruction, advanced materials, and drug delivery (Figure 7) are clearly explained, and they constitute an excellent example to continue with the development of said materials.\n\nIn the biomedical area, Lin et al. [84] prepared polyethylene glycolated (PEG) poly(glycerol sebacate) scaffolds employing solvent-free urethane crosslinking and spontaneous pore-forming procedure at room temperature (Figure 7a). The authors include a hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) crosslinker to evaluate the controllable crosslinking degrees and hierarchical macro-/micro-porosities. Also, a bilayer with an osteoinductive mesoporous bioactive glass (MBG) could enhance the reconstruction in vivo assessments. Authors found that the experiment, conducted for at least 12 h, reveals a low crosslinking degree which stimulates chondrogenic differentiation, maintains chondrocyte phenotype, and enhances cartilage matrix secretion compared to elastic polymer with a high crosslinking degree, emphasizing the importance of matrix viscoelasticity in cartilage regeneration. This proposal for osteochondral regeneration is an excellent candidate and was expected for clinical translation to exhibit extraordinary regenerative efficiency after 12 weeks in the subchondral bone. Moreover, Wang et al. [97] presented degradable citric acid-based conductive polyester elastomers in terms of platforms for sensing. The platform created after the polycondensation process with citric acid, 1,8-octane diol, and poly(ethylene glycol) as monomers were coated with a silver nanowire layer and soft electronic material for flexible electronic devices was created. The mechanical stimuli evaluation of the poly(1,8-octane diol citrate acid) (POC) copolymer with PEG exhibits recoverable deformation after bending, converting strain to detectable resistance. For the sensing evaluation in humans, various human emotions were successfully evaluated with a wireless sensor. The results demonstrated that degradable citric acid-based polyester elastomers are promising for next-generation sustainable and flexible electronic devices.\n\nIn the same field of biomedicine, Sandmeier et al. [98] presented a biodegradable elastomer obtained by ring-opening polymerization of phenyl bis (2,4,6-trimethyl-benzoyl)phosphine oxide (BAPO) with 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA) or 2,3-hydroxypropyl acrylate (DIOL). The well-defined photoinitiator-polymer conjugates BAPO-HEA and BAPO-DIOL were digitally light-processed to obtain a 3D printing material without organic solvents. The result indicates that photopolymerization provides new opportunities for fabricating tissue scaffolds and medical devices with high-quality 3D printing in biodegradable shape-memory devices. Also, the final material exhibits this shape-memory behavior after the temperature is applied. The initial object was deformed at ~80 °C and fixed in that shape by cooling to −20 °C. This work offers new perspectives for the solvent-free additive manufacturing of bioresorbable medical implants and other functional devices. In the same order, Zhang et al. [99] presented an advanced material based on the design and manufacturing of cost-effective tannin-based polyether polyol (MTEBP) that was synthesized using tannin extract (MTE) as an efficient and reusable absorbent for oil and solvents. After copolymerization, the authors evaluated the adsorption capacities of the materials to soybean oil, xylene, dichloromethane, n-hexane, and cyclohexane, increasing their values by 53.5%, 57.9%, 115.1%, 83.5%, and 97.2%, respectively. Also, mechanical and thermal properties were enhanced after formulation. This work affords a feasible and sustainable strategy to fabricate bio-based, eco-friendly, tannin-based materials with high adsorption capacities for oil spill clean-ups.\n\nFinally, a very new technique to implement biodegradable elastomers into a drug delivery system is presented by Freire et al. [100] (Figure 7e). This study aimed to develop bio-based poly (thioether-ester) nanoparticles containing full-spectrum cannabis extracts and assay their potential efficacy in vitro BF16F10 melanoma cells. Tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol, and other natural compounds produced by Cannabis sativa exhibit a wide array of therapeutic effects on the human body but limited bioavailability due to their low solubility in water and moderate stability. The result indicates that poly (thioether-ester) nanoparticles were effective, and nanocarriers and potential anticancer activity could be demonstrated.\n\n5. Elastomers: The Circular Economy and Sustainability\n\nThe current development of our society is only possible by considering the role of polymers or plastics [101]. The generation and disposal of synthetic plastics are among the major current concerns in the sustainability discourse of large industries. The current issues with elastomers in terms of sustainability are multifaceted and include resource dependency, energy-intensive production, end-of-life management, microplastic pollution, toxic additives, and a lack of circular economy practices [102,103].\n\nIn recent decades, efforts have been made to develop various types of biodegradable plastics, aiming to constitute a class of “green polymers” following the principles of green chemistry. However, the degradation of plastics in landfills does not lead to the recovery of material value, and their degradation in oceans could create new or unwanted environmental impacts [104]. Strategies have been implemented to promote reuse and recycling techniques, extending the lifespan of materials and promoting their integration into a circular economic model [105,106]. As such, a wide breadth of literature has touched upon circular principles in the context of elastomers. Different R-strategies have been proposed or analyzed, and themes related to sustainability have also been integrated into part of the studies. This section explains the concepts of a circular economy and sustainability and describes which circular strategies have been mentioned in the previous elastomer literature.\n\n5.1. The Circular Economy\n\nCircular economic processes are not new and have been used for thousands of years. However, the foundations of the concept in the literature are reasonably recent. According to Mohajan, the term “circular economy” gained prominence in the late 20th century as a response to environmental and resource challenges [107]. Stahel and Reday first describe a loop economy framework that describes waste reduction and resource efficiency strategies and emphasizes the need to design products for longevity and efficient resource use [108]. Pearce and Turner explore the relationships between natural resources in the economy and the linearity of traditional economic systems [109]. One of the most commonly used definitions, a product of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation [110], defines a circular economy as “an industrial economy that is restorative or regenerative by intention and design”. Since the 2010s, many definitions have been proposed [111], with most focusing on reducing, reusing, and recycling resources, known as the first of the “R-strategies”. Geissdoerfer et al. define the circular economy as “a regenerative system in which resource input and waste, emission, and energy leakage are minimized by slowing, closing, and narrowing material and energy loops. These terms can be achieved through long-lasting design, maintenance, repair, reuse, remanufacturing, refurbishing, and recycling”. As such, the circular economy promotes resource efficiency and seeks to decouple economic growth from resource depletion and waste generation. This approach has gained significance in the 21st century as societies and businesses increasingly recognize the need for more sustainable and responsible economic models in the face of environmental challenges and resource constraints [112].\n\n5.2. Adding Sustainability to the Mix: Eco-Concept\n\nWhile sustainability is a term commonly used in the scientific literature, government documents, and the media, its definition is often ambiguous [113,114]. This lesser inclusion is partial because sustainability is a concept that has evolved dramatically since the beginning of the second half of the 20th century. The term was mainly used in the 1960s and 1970s to refer to environmental issues [115]. As one of the first contributions to early sustainability discussions about the trade-offs between economic development, social equity, and environmental conservation, “Limits to Growth”, published in 1972 [116], explores the implications of exponential economic and population growth and resource depletion. In 1987, the Brundtland Report, a result of the World Commission on Environment and Development, led by Gro Harlem Brundtland, famously defines sustainability as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” [117]. More recently, Geissdoerfer et al., after reviewing several definitions for the term, define sustainability as “the balanced and systemic integration of intra and intergenerational economic, social, and environmental performance”. Definitions that highlight the three pillars of sustainability, also known as the triple bottom line, are some of which are the most used today [112]. Even though circular economic applications can be solutions to achieving sustainability, both concepts are only sometimes aligned in the literature. Few circular economic definitions are linked to sustainable development, and economic prosperity is usually presented as the concept’s primary goal [111]. Circular economic processes are applied for economic and sometimes environmental considerations, but rarely social ones [118]. This means that sustainability trade-offs are not considered more often than otherwise. The existing literature [111,112,118] underlines the importance of accounting for sustainability when evaluating circular economy applications.\n\n5.3. Elastomers and Circularity\n\nMany studies focus on designing plastics that are more circular by nature. In their study, Hong and Chen [104] analyze the significant advancements in recyclable “green polymers” or chemically recyclable polymers, focusing on the technical and environmental benefits obtained in developing reuse and depolymerization processes for the chemical recycling of polymers at the end of their lifespan. Zanchin and Leone [119] review recent developments in thermoplastic polyolefin elastomers (P-TPE), highlighting their mechanical flexibility, lightweight, easy processability, and recyclability compared to thermosetting rubbers. P-TPEs meet the requirements for a sustainable circular economy for the next generation of plastics, showing promise as smart materials with shape memory and self-healing properties, particularly in innovative food packaging and coatings.\n\nUtrera-Barrios et al., in four separate papers, introduce elastomer redesign with the analysis of self-healing properties. The first paper [101] reveals the challenges that rubbers face in reprocessing, suggesting self-healing to automatically repair or restore damages, thereby increasing their lifespan and aligning them with the circular economy model. Self-repairing rubbers exhibit high healing efficiency and exceptional mechanical behavior, essential properties sought in sustainable materials. A second paper [120] develops new biodegradable elastomer compounds capable of self-repair using a blend of epoxidized natural rubber and polycaprolactone reinforced with alginates (salt group). This combination gives the material thermal self-healing capabilities, catastrophic damage restoration, and the ability to recover its mechanical properties, contributing to the circularity of elastomeric materials. A third paper [105] delves into crucial self-healing concepts in the automotive industry’s most widely used elastomeric matrices. They analyze the state of the art considering the nature of the elastomeric matrix (natural or synthetic), different curing mechanisms (extrinsic, intrinsic, and combinations), the chemistry underlying them, and mechanical performance. This review highlights the transformative impact of these concepts in revolutionizing the industry and paving the way towards a more sustainable future. Finally, a fourth [121] addresses promising biodegradable plant-based fillers, their biosynthesis, chemical properties, applications, reinforcing effects, and improvements in the performance of composite materials based on natural and synthetic rubber matrices in elastomeric compounds. Sustainable fillers such as quercetin, chitosan, lignin, and cellulose are considered.\n\nOther authors focus more on recyclability. Kumawat et al. seek to understand the relationship between the retention of physical properties and the load of granulated rubber and particle size. They characterize four different sizes of rubber particles physicochemically, concluding that finer particle sizes result in better dispersion of granulated rubber particles, providing superior mechanical, extrusion, and wear properties. This suggests that reducing particle size can increase the volume of recycled product utilization [106]. Georgescu et al. use recycled rubber in a range of 10–50% by weight as a filler material, eco-friendly reinforcement material, active loads, plasticizers, vulcanizing agents, and antioxidants to obtain chloroprene rubber. Recycled rubber reduces the compound’s ecological footprint by reducing its mass and revealing properties of elasticity, hardness, and abrasion resistance, making it a viable option regarding raw material life cycle, sustainability, eco-efficiency, and economic efficiency [122]. Kouhi et al. propose a simple method to reuse recycled rubber (RR) in closed-cell elastomeric foams based on ethylene propylene diene rubber (EPDM). Results in rheometry, morphology, and mechanical behaviors indicate that using RR could be a viable alternative for manufacturing high-performance EPDM foams with improved hardness and resilience, serving as an ecological substitute for virgin products [123].\n\nSamir et al. explore the production of biodegradable polymers through chemical treatment, microorganisms, and enzymes, focusing on their environmental impact and ease of disposal. They investigate using natural fibers such as kenaf fiber, hemp fiber, and abaca fiber as reinforcement materials in biocomposites, highlighting their properties and potential applications to enhance the bond between the polymeric matrix and natural fibers in composites [103]. They emphasize the potential of biodegradable polymers to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly in the medical industry and in reducing the carbon footprint of plastic production. The proportion of ground tire rubber (GTR) in thermoplastic elastomers has also been analyzed as a circular economy strategy and sustainable development in the recycling of waste tire rubber. The results obtained differed from what was expected, as mechanical properties and processability decreased with increasing GTR content. The results improved by adding PE-g-MAH to the composition, particularly in tensile strength and elongation at break [124]. Gregory and Williams investigate the recyclability of thermoplastic elastomers (TPE) that do not degrade during recycling. They use regularly placed sodium/lithium carboxylate side chains instead of hydrocarbons. This block polyester shows significantly higher tensile strengths than its non-functionalized counterparts, with high elasticity and elastic recovery, providing beneficial properties for thermal reprocessing [125].\n\nIn an innovative contribution to the literature, Al Rashid and Koç address how additive manufacturing (AM) processes can synergistically impact and bring new life to discarded polymeric parts through distributed recycling and manufacturing. They reuse polymeric waste and turn it into valuable resources, generating low costs for specific AM and 3D printing applications for use in the aerospace, automotive, biomedical, sports, food, electronics, and construction sectors [126].\n\nIn their paper, Cherubini et al. aim to improve the process of obtaining elastomeric compounds by introducing used cooking oils, replacing typical mineral processing oils (lubricants). Cooking oils showed similar rheological behavior to traditional oils used in rubber production, resulting in the same processability of the resulting compound, as well as fracture and traction properties. These are promising results for applying circular economy principles by substituting mineral oils in manufacturing processing [127].\n\nIn their review, Doyle et al. analyze the critical considerations in designing circular products and the ecological engineering of polymeric foams. This includes the characterization of materials across a broader spectrum of molten polymer gas solutions, aging behavior, polymer chain adaptation, compression, and detailed modeling of the effects of cutting on cell nucleation, as well as the improvement of processing tools to achieve high results and defined pressure drop rates [128].\n\n5.4. R-Strategies in the Lifecycle of Elastomers\n\nR-strategies, or closed loops that indicate a material flow in a product’s lifecycle to an earlier node of the lifecycle, are generally understood to be circular economic processes [129]. Earlier frameworks for waste management outline the 3R framework, which stands for “Reduce, Reuse, Recycle”. Now, as many as 60 R-strategies can be found in the literature [130], and many effectively refer to similar processes. Cramer’s 10R framework (Refuse, Reduce, Renew, Reuse, Repair, Refurbish, Remanufacture, Repurpose, Recycle, Recover) [131], which is very close to Rieke’s et al. R-strategies [129], is differentiated enough to provide a more precise analysis than the 3R framework. We use this framework to evaluate the applicability of circular economy processes to the lifecycle of elastomer production. Table 3 defines each R-strategy and enumerates the elastomer-related literature in which applications related to these strategies are proposed. The literature cited here is incomplete but offers a general idea of which R-strategies are most commonly mentioned in the literature that ties elastomers to circular applications.\n\nCircular elastomer production applications are focused on only a few of Cramer’s ten R-strategies [131]. Reduce and renew strategies are commonly cited in the literature. This is mainly because elastomers are often unusable after a certain period. Reusing, refurbishing, remanufacturing, or repurposing are rarely appropriate avenues. Redesigning the elastomers to limit the number of raw materials used or lengthen the product’s lifespan is more appropriate. Organizations employ research and development methods in light of these strategies. On the other hand, strategies that improve the recyclability of elastomers are also very commonly cited in the literature. Creating an elastomer that conserves value and can be easily recycled at the end of its lifespan is another objective that relies on research and development. What can be retained from the literature on circular strategies for elastomers is that the brunt of the effort in making an elastomer more circular is directed towards initiative-taking measures rather than reactive ones. While this is more interesting in terms of cost and energy saving eventually, it also requires firms to invest in research to make their products more circular early in the design process.\n\n6. Conclusions and Perspectives\n\nIn this review the essential oils, d-limonene, β-pinene, terpenes, some menthol, β-citronellol, and terpenoids have the characteristics of being low in toxicity, inexpensive, and can be obtained by several extraction techniques; NR, PB and SBS modification with these compounds via cross-metathesis allows the synthesis of terpene-terminated oligomers and bio-based elastomers. They can be used in pharmaceutical, cosmetics, packaging, and chemical industries.\n\nOf the mentioned methods, the synthesis of polyols by olefin metathesis reaction (depolymerization or degradation) has shown that both natural and industrial rubbers can be modified and degraded under mild conditions using natural resources with -OH groups and obtain bio-based diols and polyols (not derived from oil), which can be used for the synthesis of polymeric materials with elastomeric properties and the polyurethane industry.\n\nThe polyesters, polyethers, and their copolymers (segmented poly-ether-ester) arise as new sources with elastomer properties; these can be synthesized from bio-based resources such as castor oil, natural rubber, polylactic acid (PLA), lignocellulosic, limonene terpenes, fatty acids, vanillin, tetrahydrocannabinol, among others. These materials have the advantage of being biodegradable since the ester group is reported to be susceptible to microbial attacks. They have numerous applications, such as aerospace, construction, automobile, and, more recently, biomedical industries.\n\nThe current issues with elastomers in terms of sustainability are multifaceted and include resource dependency, energy-intensive production, end-of-life management, microplastic pollution, toxic additives, and a lack of circular economy practices. Circular elastomer production applications are focused on only a few of Cramer’s ten R-strategies. This is mainly because elastomers are often unusable after a certain period. Reusing, refurbishing, remanufacturing, or repurposing are rarely appropriate avenues. Creating an elastomer that conserves value and can be easily recycled at the end of its lifespan is another objective that relies on research and development; it also requires firms to invest in research to make their products more circular early in the design process.\n\nPerspectives:\n\nWe need standard norms that demand the use of bio-based elastomeric materials or the incorporation of recycled elastomer to produce new materials.\n\nStudies and techniques are needed to evaluate the formation and pollution of nano and microplastics released from elastomeric materials.\n\nFurther research is required to explore R-strategies pathways, their classification, and the potential application of bio-based elastomers, such as “reuse–reduce–recycle”, to promote sustainable elastomer materials practices.\n\nFinally, for many elastomeric materials, sustainability in terms of environmental decomposition needs to be studied or reported; therefore, degradation and biodegradation studies are required. In addition to the fact that if a bio-based elastomer, this does not make it biodegradable or compostable, requiring studies for its classification.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceptualization, M.B., A.M., J.D.H.-V., T.S., M.R.-M. and C.D.T.-Q.; methodology, M.B., A.M., J.D.H.-V., T.S., M.R.-M. and C.D.T.-Q.; validation, M.B., A.Y.Y., G.L.-B. and C.D.T.-Q.; investigation, M.B., A.M., J.D.H.-V., T.S., M.R.-M. and C.D.T.-Q.; resources, M.B., A.Y.Y., G.L.-B. and C.D.T.-Q.; writing—original draft preparation, M.B., A.M., J.D.H.-V., T.S., M.R.-M. and C.D.T.-Q.; writing—review and editing, M.B., A.Y.Y., G.L.-B. and C.D.T.-Q.; funding acquisition, M.B., A.Y.Y., G.L.-B. and C.D.T.-Q.

In addressing this challenge, nano-based antibacterial agents offer a promising avenue of research. In the present study, we used an extract of Moringa oleifera, a widely recognized edible and medicinal plant, to synthesize biogenetic tellurium nanoparticles (Bio-TeNPs). Transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and dynamic light scattering analyses revealed that the obtained Bio-TeNPs had diameters between 20 and 50 nm, and zeta potential values of 23.7 ± 3.3 mV. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the Bio-TeNPs consisted primarily of Te(0), along with some organic constituents. Remarkably, these Bio-TeNPs exhibited potent antibacterial activity against a spectrum of pathogens, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhimurium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus agalactiae. In addition, findings from growth curve experiments, live/dead cell staining, and scanning electron microscopy observations of cell morphology demonstrated that Bio-TeNPs at a concentration of 0.07 mg/mL effectively disrupted E. coli and K. pneumoniae cells, leading to cell rupture or shrinkage. The biofilm inhibition rates of 0.7 mg/mL Bio-TeNPs against E. coli and K. pneumoniae reached 92% and 90%, respectively. In addition, 7 mg/mL Bio-TeNPs effectively eradicated E. coli from the surfaces of glass slides, with a 100% clearance rate. These outcomes underscore the exceptional antibacterial efficacy of Bio-TeNPs and highlight their potential as promising nanomaterials for combating bacterial infections.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nBacterial infections currently stand as the second-leading cause of death worldwide, significantly impacting both human health and economic development [1]. Unfortunately, the irrational use of antibiotics and the natural selection of bacteria have exacerbated the problem of drug-resistant strains [2]. Consequently, there is an urgent need to explore novel therapeutic avenues to combat bacterial infections. Fortunately, nanotechnology has been rapidly advancing in the realm of biomedicine, offering a promising approach to address both bacterial infections and drug resistance [3]. Bionanomaterials, which are distinguished by their enhanced bioactivity and biocompatibility, compared with their physically and chemically synthesized counterparts, stand out as particularly promising candidates in this regard. Various antibacterial nanomaterials, including AgNPs [4], AuNPs [5], CuONPs [6], and ZnONPs [7], have demonstrated high levels of efficacy in combating bacterial infections. Compared with conventional methods which are reliant on hazardous chemicals and involve the production of toxic by-products [8], biological synthesis methods offer a safer and more environmentally friendly alternative [9]. The production of bionanomaterials is characterized by mild conditions, safe processes, and overall eco-friendliness [10]. Bionanomaterials are also easy to synthesize [11]. In general, microorganisms and plant extracts are used to synthesize bionanomaterials [12]. Compared with microorganisms, edible and medicinal plants offer a richer and safer array of active metabolites. Previous research has indicated that natural active products in plant extracts could be more effectively combined with nanomaterials so that they gain additional biological functions [13].\n\nMoringa oleifera is an edible medicinal plant native to India [14]; its extracts contain various bioactive properties that are now being effectively exploited [15]. M. oleifera is currently used to produce functional nanomaterials, such as AgNPs [16,17], MgONPs [18,19], SeNPs [20], and ZnONPs [21], which exhibit antibacterial, antioxidant, and anticancer properties. Tellurium (Te) is a semimetallic element in the chalcogen family, and commonly exists in nature in oxidized states of −II, 0, +IV, and +VI, with Te(IV) and Te(VI) as its main forms [22]. Te compounds were first used as antimicrobial agents as early as 1932. These compounds exert their antimicrobial properties mainly in the form of tellurite ions [23]. Additionally, tellurium nanomaterials have also been used for applications in biomedicine on account of their antimicrobial, antioxidant, antifungal, and anticancer properties [24]. In recent years, biosynthesis of the nanoforms of Te has attracted the attention of many researchers. For instance, Pseudoalteromonas shioyasakiensis [25] and Mortierella sp. AB1 [26] were used to synthesize biogenetic Te nanoparticles (Bio-TeNPs), which inhibited various pathogenic bacteria. Similarly, Streptomyces cyaneus [27] and Gayadomonas sp. TNPM15 were used to produce Bio-TeNPs which repressed certain Aspergillus pathogens and phytopathogenic fungi [28]. Studies such as these have demonstrated the excellent antibacterial properties of Bio-TeNPs. In addition, extracts of aloe vera [29], pepper [30], and citrus fruit [31] have been used to synthesize antibacterial and anticancer Bio-TeNPs. However, the use of M. oleifera extract to synthesize Bio-TeNPs has not yet been reported.\n\nThe thin branches and discarded shredded leaves of M. oleifera have lower economic value, compared with the seeds and flowers. The use of such by-products for nanomaterial production could increase their value as plant material, while at the same time reducing the cost of synthesizing Bio-TeNPs. In the present study, the extract was taken from thin branches and discarded shredded leaves of M. oleifera; this was used as a stabilizing, capping, and reducing agent to synthesize Bio-TeNPs. These Bio-TeNPs were then characterized by visible light spectrum analysis, transmission electronic microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential analysis, energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In addition, the antibacterial activity of Bio-TeNPs was tested in a series of experiments and then evaluated.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\n2.1. Materials\n\nM. oleifera samples were obtained from Hubei Mingshan Jingnan Moringa Technology Co., Ltd. (Huangshi, China). Potassium tellurite (K2TeO3) was purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology (Shanghai, China) Co., Ltd. Chemical element tellurium [Chem-Te(0)] (CAS No. 13494-80-9) was obtained from Shanghai Yien Chemical Technology (Shanghai, China) Co., Ltd. The strains Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 700603, Shigella dysenteriae CMCC 51252, Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 14028, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619, Streptococcus agalactiae E442, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 were obtained from the Strain Preservation Center of Hubei Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Wuhan, China). Bacteria were cultured on MHA (Mueller–Hinton Agar) medium at 37 °C.\n\n2.2. Biosynthesis of Bio-TeNPs\n\nFresh specimens of discarded thin branches and leaves underwent a process of washing, drying, and storage at room temperature. A quantity of 100 g of these thin branches and leaves was then combined with 1000 mL of distilled water (ddH2O) and brought to a boil for 5–10 min. Next, the mixture was filtered, and the resulting liquid was stored at 4 °C for 24 h before use. Subsequently, a 50 mL portion of the extract was blended with 0.1 g of K2TeO3 in a 100 mL glass beaker at 28 °C for 4 h, using a magnetic stirrer. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min and washed three times with ddH2O. Subsequently, the washed tellurite nanoparticles were resuspended in 10 mL of ddH2O. The resulting material was dried, and the concentrations of Bio-TeNPs were then determined.\n\n2.3. Characterization of Bio-TeNPs\n\nTo gain insights into the morphology and composition of Bio-TeNPs, the Bio-TeNPs produced as described in Section 2.2 were subjected to further analysis using a previously established protocol [26]. The Bio-TeNPs solution underwent examination using a plate reader within a wavelength range of 300–800 nm (SpectraMax i3x, Molecular Devices, CA, USA). Subsequently, the Bio-TeNPs solution was sonicated, applied onto a copper mesh, dried, and processed for observation and EDS analysis under transmission electron microscopy (Tecnai G2 F30, FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA). Additionally, the Bio-TeNPs solution was sonicated, diluted, and introduced into an electrophoresis system with instrumental parameters set to 25 °C for 10 s to determine its zeta potential (Zetasizer Nano ZS90, Malvern, UK). Simultaneously, a portion of the same liquid was transferred to a cuvette, with instrument parameters set to 25 °C for 10 s at an angle of 173° to measure dynamic light scattering (Zetasizer Nano ZS90, Malvern, UK). Following these measurements, the Bio-TeNPs were subjected to drying using an SJIA-10N vacuum freeze dryer (Ningbo YinZhou Sjia Lab Equipment Co., Ltd., Yinzhou, China). The dried Bio-TeNPs were then affixed on a tray coated with gold and observed using a scanning electron microscope (SU8010, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Dried Bio-TeNPs were also tested using X-ray diffraction (Bruker D8 Advance, GER, Billerica, MA, USA) with a scan time of 10 min and a scan rate of 10°/min. Further analysis involved pressing the dried Bio-TeNPs, setting the spectral range to 400–4000 cm−1, and ensuring a resolution accuracy of 0.4 cm−1 using infrared spectroscopy (Nicolet IS10, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Dried Bio-TeNPs were also pressed and placed in an apparatus for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ESCALAB 250XI, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with a pass energy of 30 eV (0.10 eV) and 120 eV (1.00 eV) at a spot size of 500 µm. Under these conditions, upon excitation by X-rays, photoelectron data were collected to form an energy spectrum.\n\n2.4. Antibacterial Activity Tests\n\nTo assess antibacterial activity, inhibition zone tests were performed. First, the chosen bacteria were cultured on MHA medium overnight at 37 °C. Following incubation, bacterial colonies from the MHA plates were harvested, washed, and suspended in 0.85% (w/v) saline solution. These suspensions were then diluted to a turbidity of 0.5 McFarland standard (~1 × 108 cfu/mL) using a turbidity meter (Vitek 2 DensiCHEK) (bioMérieux, Lyon, France). The diluted bacterial suspensions were evenly spread onto MHA plates (50 µL bacterial suspension per plate). Subsequently, sterilized Oxford cups were placed on each plate, and varying concentrations of Bio-TeNPs (0.07, 0.7, and 7 mg/mL) were added to the cups (100 µL each). As a control, an extract of M. oleifera (7 mg/mL) and Chem-Te (0) (7 mg/mL) was utilized. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 15 h, allowing for the inhibition of bacterial growth. Following incubation, the diameters of the inhibition zones surrounding the Oxford cups were measured using vernier calipers; these diameters were recorded as indicators of antibacterial efficacy.\n\n2.5. Growth Curve Experiments\n\nTo further evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of Bio-TeNPs, a growth curve analysis was conducted. Bacteria, cultured overnight on MHA plates as outlined in Section 2.4, were harvested and suspended in MHB media. A fresh suspension of E. coli and K. pneumoniae with a turbidity of 0.6 McFarland units was prepared using a turbidity meter (Vitek 2 DensiCHEK). Next, 50 µL of the suspension was added to 5 mL of MHB medium. The growth of E. coli and K. pneumoniae in MHB media was then assessed in the presence of Bio-TeNPs, Chem-Te(0), and M. oleifera extract at concentrations of 0.07, 0.035, and 0.007 mg/mL. Bacteria cultured in an MHB medium without any samples served as the control group. Next, 200 µL samples were collected every 2 h, and their optical density was measured at 600 nm using a microplate reader (SpectraMax i3x, Molecular Devices, CA, USA).\n\n2.6. Live/Dead Cell Staining\n\nTo investigate the bactericidal effect of Bio-TeNPs on E. coli and K. pneumoniae, a live/dead cell staining experiment was conducted. Bacteria, cultured overnight on MHA plates as detailed in Section 2.4, were harvested and resuspended in MHB media to achieve a turbidity of 0.5 McFarland standard (~1 × 108 cfu/mL). These bacterial suspensions were then cultured with Bio-TeNPs at concentrations of either 0 or 0.07 mg/mL in a shaker at 150 rpm, incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Following incubation, the cells were collected and washed with 0.85% (w/v) saline solution. A LIVE/DEAD Bacterial Staining Kit (BBcellProbe® N01/PI, BestBio, Shanghai, China) was utilized to stain the live and dead cells according to the manufacturer’s instructions [32]. In brief, the bacteria were resuspended in PI and NO1 dye working solution, followed by incubation away from light for 15 min. Subsequently, the bacteria were washed and resuspended in 0.85% saline solution. Finally, a 5–10 μL quantity of bacterial suspension was taken and added to a slide for sample observation. The stained bacteria were excited at 488 nm, and live and dead cells were observed using laser scanning confocal microscopy (Nikon Eclipse Ti, Tokyo, Japan).\n\n2.7. Morphological Observation of Microorganisms\n\nBacteria (~1 × 108 cfu/mL) were cultured in the MHB media at 0.07 mg/mL of Bio-TeNPs, with ddH20, Chem-Te(0) and M. oleifera extract as control groups. The cultures were incubated at 150 rpm at 37 °C for 4 h. After incubation, 2 mL amounts of cultures were collected and processed according to previously described methods [20]. Briefly, the collected samples were fixed overnight at 4 °C in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, washed three times with 1.5 mL of physiological saline solution, and then dehydrated with a gradient of anhydrous ethanol (30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%). Next, the obtained samples were freeze-dried for 12–24 h. The bacteria were then immobilized on trays and treated with gold spray. The treated E. coli and K. pneumoniae were observed via SEM (S-4800, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan).\n\n2.8. Biofilm Formation Inhibition Assay\n\nCrystalline violet staining and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) staining were used to determine the effect of compounds on E. coli and K. pneumoniae biofilm formation and attachment. According to the method described in Section 2.4, fresh E. coli and K. pneumoniae suspensions of 0.6 M were prepared using a turbidity meter (Vitek 2 DensiCHEK). A 20 µL amount of bacterial solution and a 180 µL amount of MHB medium containing different concentrations of Bio-TeNPs (0.007, 0.035, 0.07, and 0.7 mg/mL), extract of M. oleifera (0.07 and 0.7 mg/mL), and Chem-Te (0) (0.007, 0.035, 0.07, and 0.7 mg/mL) were added to the 96-well plate, mixed uniformly and incubated statically at 37 °C for 24. The bacterial biofilm formation was then washed using PBS, fixed in methanol, and stained with crystal violet and solubilized 33% (v/v) acetic acid solution. In addition, a portion of cultured bacteria was collected and washed with PBS to remove planktonic bacteria. Subsequently, bacteria were stained with FITC for 30 min and washed with PBS to remove unbound dye. Finally, stained bacteria were observed under an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti 2, Tokyo, Japan).\n\n2.9. Clearance Rate of Bio-TeNPs against E. coli on the Surfaces of Glass Slides\n\nBacteria, cultured overnight on MHA plates as detailed in Section 2.4, were harvested and resuspended in MHB media. The E. coli suspension (30 µL, ~2 × 108 cfu/mL) was evenly spread onto a glass slide measuring 2 cm × 2 cm and allowed to air-dry for 15 min to fix the bacteria. Subsequently, the area covered with the bacterial specimen was treated with 100 µL of Bio-TeNPs (7 and 0.7 mg/mL), Chem-Te(0) (7 and 0.7 mg/mL), M. oleifera extract (7 mg/mL), and 0.85% (w/v) normal saline; this was dispensed using pipettes, the tips of which were used to achieve an even spread. After 20 min, cells were recovered from the glass slides by scraping with cotton swabs, which were then immersed in 1 mL of 0.85% (w/v) normal saline. Finally, 50 µL of the aforementioned treated normal saline stock solutions and dilutions (10−1, 10−2, and 10−3) were spread onto MHA plates. The number of colonies was enumerated to determine the bacterial survival rate.\n\n2.10. Cytotoxicity Evaluation of Bio-TeNPs\n\nIn order to evaluate the cytotoxicity of Bio-TeNPs, vero-E6 cells were used as a cell model, determined by the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) (APExBIO, Houston, TX, USA). First, Vero-E6 cells were inoculated in a 96-well culture plate (1.0 × 104 cells/100 μL per well) for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Then, Bio-TeNPs were added to 96-well plates with different final concentrations (7, 0.7, and 0.07 mg/mL). Chem-Te(0) (7 mg/mL) and Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (7 mg/mL) were used as control groups. After 24 h, the culture medium was removed and washed twice with PBS. Finally, to each well of the plate was added 100 μL fresh DMEM and 10 μL CCK-8; incubation then continued for 3 h at 37 °C. The absorbance at 450 nm was determined using a multi-plate reader (SpectraMax i3x, Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA).\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Characterization of Bio-TeNPs\n\nThe Bio-TeNPs were typically black in color (Figure 1A). The UV-visible spectrum of the Bio-TeNPs was analyzed using a microplate reader. A number of peaks noticeable at approximately 230 nm, 250 nm, 260 nm, and a slight peak at 350 nm were observed at 0.07 mg/mL of Bio-TeNPs (Figure 1B). At a concentration of 0.7 mg/mL of Bio-TeNPs, a distinct peak at 350 nm was observed (Figure 1C). To identify the morphology and size of the Bio-TeNPs in this study, TEM, SEM, DLS, EDS, and XRD were performed. The results indicated that the Bio-TeNPs had diameters of 20 to 50 nm and irregular spherical shapes (Figure 2A–D). Some of the Bio-TeNPs in the SEM were slightly larger, probably because some of the nanoparticles agglomerated together during the freeze-drying process. The zeta potential of the Bio-TeNPs was found to be 23.7 ± 3.3 mV. The EDX result indicated that the composition of Bio-TeNPs was rich in tellurium. In addition, the XRD spectrum showed Te crystal peaks at (100), (101), (102), and (110) (Figure S1), and these four peaks were similar to the findings of previous studies [33].\n\nBased on the FTIR results, peaks were observed in the M. oleifera extract at 570.98 (C–I stretch), 726.12 (C-Cl stretch), 1071.19 (indicative of cyclic ethers or large rings containing carbon), 1264.39 (suggestive of aromatic primary amine, CN stretch), 1404.89 and 1564.17 (representing carboxylate groups), 1581.72 (related to secondary amine, NH bend), 2851.15 (associated with saturated aliphatic groups, methylene), and 3153.17 (indicative of ammonium ions) cm−1 (Figure 3A). Bio-TeNPs exhibited peaks at 625.03 (associated with alkyne, C–H bend), 1075.17 (related to the primary amine, C–N stretch), 1198.56 (indicative of tertiary amine, C–N stretch), 1272.26 (suggestive of hydroxyl groups, primary or secondary), 1361.61 (representing aliphatic nitro compounds), 1440.89 (associated with methyl groups, C–H stretch), 1488.20 (indicative of aromatic nitro compounds), 1649.01 (related to olefinic groups), and 3385.78 (associated with hydroxyl groups) cm−1 (Figure 3B). All the interpretations were based on an analysis of infrared spectra previously published in the literature [34]. These findings suggested that the M. oleifera extract contained proteins, aromatic compounds, carboxylate groups, aliphatic acids, and inorganic ions, while the Bio-TeNPs contained proteins, aliphatic acids, and aromatic nitro compounds. Notably, the proteins, aliphatic acids, and aromatic compounds present in the Bio-TeNPs originated from the M. oleifera extract. The XPS results also showed that the Bio-TeNPs contained many C and O elements (Figure 3C); this meant that the main components of the Bio-TeNPs were organic in nature. Furthermore, the presence of Te3d, associated with Te(0), was confirmed through XPS analysis (Figure 3D), and no Te(IV) peak was observed. This result indicated that Te(IV) was reduced to Te(0) by the M. oleifera extract and that Te(0) was an important constituent of Bio-TeNPs.\n\n3.2. Antibacterial Activity of Bio-TeNPs\n\nA zone of inhibition test was conducted to determine the antibacterial activity of the Bio-TeNPs. The results indicated that M. oleifera extract displayed noticeable antibacterial activity against S. dysenteriae, with slight effectiveness against K. pneumoniae and E. coli (Table 1). Chem-Te(0) demonstrated antibacterial efficacy against S. dysenteriae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. typhimurium, S. pneumoniae, and S. agalactiae (Table 1). Bio-TeNPs exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against all tested pathogens except S. aureus (Table 1). Pictures of inhibition zones are shown in Figure S2. Though M. oleifera extract and Chem-Te(0) exhibited varied inhibitory effects against these bacteria, their levels of potency were generally lower than those of Bio-TeNPs at equivalent concentrations. This suggested that M. oleifera extract enhanced the antibacterial properties of Bio-TeNPs. Notably, M. oleifera extract by itself exhibited no antibacterial activity against S. typhimurium, S. pneumonia, and S. agalactiae, but it did enhance the antibacterial activity of Bio-TeNPs against these bacteria. Three explanations may be offered for these results, as follows: (1) It is possible that, during the synthesis of Bio-TeNPs, the active ingredients were enriched on the nanoparticles, resulting in higher concentrations on the Bio-TeNPs. M. oleifera extract has been reported to exhibit antibacterial ability against S. typhimurium [35]. However, no antibacterial effect against S. typhimurium was observed in our study. This might have been due to the active concentration of the extract. (2) The Bio-TeNPs were obtained using a typical production process involving biosynthesis methods and natural biological components [36]. These materials generally exhibit high biocompatibility which enhances the stability of the final product, increasing its persistence in biological systems, and improving its interaction with biological environments, thereby boosting its effectiveness. (3) The nanostructure of Bio-TeNPs might have facilitated easier penetration of bacteria, with its effectiveness being further enhanced by its multifaceted antibacterial mechanism [37].\n\n3.3. Bio-TeNPs Inhibit Bacterial Growth\n\nTo gain more insight into the antibacterial activity of Bio-TeNPs, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae were chosen for further evaluation via growth curve experiments. Bio-TeNPs at concentrations of 0.07, 0.035, and 0.007 mg/mL were selected for experimental purposes on account of their excellent antibacterial activity. The absorbance values of E. coli and K. pneumoniae increased with elapsed time in the control and M. oleifera extract group, while Bio-TeNPs and Chem-Te(0) showed different inhibitory effects on their growth (Figure 4). The results showed that Bio-TeNPs and Chem-Te(0) at 0.07 mg/mL were effective in rapidly preventing the proliferation of E. coli. At a concentration of 0.035 mg/mL, E. coli began to grow at 18 h with Chem-Te(0), whereas it remained entirely inhibited by Bio-TeNPs. When exposed to 0.007 mg/mL Chem-Te(0), E. coli growth was resumed at 16 h, while it was still predominantly inhibited at 0.07 mg/mL Bio-TeNPs (Figure 4A,C,E). Similarly, Bio-TeNPs (at 0.07 and 0.035 mg/mL) immediately inhibited the growth of K. pneumoniae, while Chem-Te(0) at the same concentration had a limited inhibitory effect on K. pneumoniae. Moreover, K. pneumoniae began to grow freely with Chem-Te(0) treatment at 4 h, while it was still inhibited by Bio-TeNPs at a concentration of 0.007 mg/mL (Figure 4B,D,F).\n\n3.4. LSCM Observation of Bacteria Treated with Bio-TeNPs\n\nThe antibacterial abilities of the Bio-TeNPs against E. coli and K. pneumoniae were further confirmed by microscopic observation. The percentage of dead cells was considerably higher, and that of live cells substantially lower, for E. coli and K. pneumoniae cells treated with 0.07 mg/mL of Bio-TeNPs, compared with corresponding values for untreated cells (Figure 5A,B). These findings indicated that the Bio-TeNPs exhibited excellent antibacterial ability.\n\n3.5. Morphological Changes after Treatment with Bio-TeNPs\n\nThe morphologies of E. coli and K. pneumoniae cells under ddH20, Chem-Te(0), and M. oleifera extract, and Bio-TeNPs treatments were observed via SEM. The results indicated that untreated E. coli and K. pneumoniae cells remained normal (Figure 6A,E). Cells treated with 0.07 mg/mL M. oleifera extract also showed no significant changes (Figure 6B,F). However, cells treated with 0.07 mg/mL Chem-Te(0) exhibited damage (Figure 6C,G), whereas the E. coli and K. pneumoniae cells treated with 0.07 mg/mL of Bio-TeNPs for 4 h were crumpled, broken, shrunken, and deformed (Figure 6D,H). The most significant cellular changes were observed after treatment with Bio-TeNPs. These results indicated that the E. coli and K. pneumoniae cells were destroyed by the Bio-TeNPs.\n\n3.6. Anti-Biofilm Activity of Bio-TeNPs\n\nBiofilm formation of E. coli and K. pneumoniae in 96-well plates was observed using the crystal violet staining method. The results revealed that M. oleifera extract exhibited significant anti-biofilm activity against K. pneumoniae, but no similar activity against E. coli was observed (Figure 7A,B). Both Chem-Te(0) and Bio-TeNPs demonstrated excellent antibacterial properties against E. coli and K. pneumoniae. With increased concentration, the inhibitory effect became more pronounced (Figure 7A,B), indicating the excellent anti-biofilm activity of Bio-TeNPs. At concentrations of 0.007 mg/mL and 0.035 mg/mL, Bio-TeNPs exhibited stronger anti-biofilm capabilities than Chem-Te(0). These results were further confirmed by the FITC staining observation. The complete E. coli and K. pneumoniae biofilms were observed at control, while biofilms were noticeably broken at 0.07 mg/mL Chem-Te(0) and Bio-TeNPs (Figure 7C).\n\n3.7. Application of Bio-TeNPs against E. coli on the Surfaces of Glass Slides\n\nE. coli often adsorbs to the surfaces of solid media in the environment, enabling it to survive, and resulting in contamination. In this study, E. coli was coated onto the surface of a glass slide to test the antibacterial application of Bio-TeNPs. The survival rates of E. coli cells treated with Bio-TeNPs and normal saline were calculated on the MHA plates (Figure 8A). It was found that the survival rates of E. coli after treatment with normal saline, 7 mg/mL M. oleifera extract, 0.7 and 7 mg/mL of Chem-Te(0), and 0.7 and 7 mg/mL of Bio-TeNPs were 100%, 97.2%, 63.9%, 0, 45.1%, and 0, respectively (Figure 8B). These findings indicated that 7 mg/mL Bio-TeNPs and Chem-Te(0) exhibited great potential for antibacterial application, while the cleaning ability of Bio-TeNPs was higher than that of Chem-Te(0) at a concentration of 0.7 mg/mL.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nIn the present study, the color, morphology, and size of Bio-TeNPs were observed through the visible absorbance spectrum, DLS, TEM, and SEM. Bio-TeNPs exhibited a number of absorption peaks at 230 nm, 250 nm, 260 nm, and 350 nm and their color was typically black. Consistent with results obtained in prior related studies, the synthesized Te nanoparticles were also black [38,39]. However, the absorption peaks of the Te nanoparticles were different. Our Bio-TeNPs have multiple absorption peaks at 200–300 nm, probably due to the complex composition of M. oleifera extract. The Bio-TeNPs produced by Shewanella baltica showed an absorption peak at 210 nm [40], whereas those synthesized using tea extracts showed an absorption peak at 270 nm [41]. This difference in spectra may be due to the different constituents of Bio-TeNPs. In addition, the concentration of Bio-TeNPs might also cause fluctuations in absorption peaks. Previous studies have shown that absorption bands may be related to the size of Te nanoparticles [42]. The DLS, TEM, and SEM results revealed that the synthesized Bio-TeNPs exhibited nearly spherical shapes with diameters of approximately 20–50 nm. These shapes and sizes are similar to those of the AgNPs, AuNPs, ZnONPs, and FeONPs synthesized by M. oleifera in a previous study [43]. Previous research has also shown that differences in plant/microbial species and synthesis conditions can cause changes in the shape and size of Bio-TeNPs [24,44].\n\nRegarding the constituents of Bio-TeNPs, FTIR analysis revealed that M. oleifera extract contained proteins, aromatic compounds, carboxylate groups, aliphatic acids, and inorganic ions, in line with previous reports [45]. Bio-TeNPs were found to contain proteins, aliphatic acids, and aromatic nitro compounds originating from M. oleifera extract. This finding is in line with the composition of AgNPs, AuNPs, ZnONPs, and FeONPs produced by M. oleifera [43]. However, there may be variations in the composition and content of these substances. Moreover, our XPS results indicated that Bio-TeNPs contained organic elements such as C, O, and Te(0). The presence of Te(0) suggests reduction by substances such as cysteine [16] in the M. oleifera extract from K2TeO3, while C and O were derived from organic compounds in the M. oleifera extract. Similarly, Te(0) has been identified as a primary constituent in Bio-TeNPs produced by microorganisms and other plants [26,31,46].\n\nThe antibacterial spectrum and efficacy of Bio-TeNPs recorded in the present work surpassed that reported in some previous studies. Regarding the antibacterial spectrum, Bio-TeNPs produced by Aspergillus welwitschiae have previously been shown to inhibit E. coli (with an inhibition zone of 29 mm at 25 mg/mL) but not Klebsiella [38]. However, in this study, Bio-TeNPs exhibited antibacterial activity against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. dysenteriae, S. typhimurium, S. pneumoniae, and S. agalactiae. Concerning antibacterial efficacy, Bio-TeNPs synthesized by Mortierella sp. AB1 was shown to inhibit E. coli (with an inhibition zone of 32.3 ± 0.9 mm at 10 mg/mL), S. dysenteriae (with an inhibition zone of 32.3 ± 1.2 mm at 10 mg/mL), and S. typhimurium (with an inhibition zone of 29.7 ± 1.5 mm at 10 mg/mL) [26]. Nonetheless, the antibacterial potency of Bio-TeNPs in this investigation surpassed that of both A. welwitschiae and Mortierella sp. AB1. This might be due to the antibacterial constituents of M. oleifera, which is an edible and medicinal plant [47]. The antibacterial activity of Bio-TeNPs recorded in the present study is comparable to that of AgNPs produced by Gracilaria crassa [48] and better than AgNPs produced by citrus sinensis peel extract [49]. Compared with M. oleifera-based nanomaterials, Bio-TeNPs in the present study showed antibacterial activity which was higher than that of AgNPs [50] and ZnONPs [51], but lower than that of iron oxide [52] nanoparticles. In the present study, Bio-TeNPs were also found to disrupt the integrity of E. coli and K. pneumoniae membranes and alter bacterial morphology. Interestingly, the positively charged Bio-TeNPs might be an important cause of the above phenomenon. Previous studies have indicated that one of the antibacterial mechanisms of biomaterials is the adsorption of positively charged nanoparticles onto negatively charged bacterial surfaces through electrostatic interaction, resulting in membrane damage and bacterial morphological changes [53]. Bar et al. also found that the interaction between different quantum dot materials and SLBs was driven by electrostatic attraction, and that defective SLBs would adsorb quantum dots more easily [54]. On the other hand, oxidative stress is also an important antibacterial mechanism, and positively charged selenium nanoparticles [55] and iron oxide nanoparticles [52] could kill bacteria through oxidative stress, contact with nanomaterials causing peroxidation of membrane phospholipids thus directly destroying the integrity of the cell membrane [53]. Moreover, Bio-TeNPs in this study showed noticeable anti-biofilm activity against E. coli and K. pneumoniae. This has rarely been reported for other Bio-TeNPs; indeed, at the time of writing, no Bio-TeNPs have been reported to exhibit anti-biofilm activity. However, extracts of pepper [30], aloe vera [29], and citric juice [31] have been reported to synthesize Bio-TeNPs against MDR E. coli and MRSA. Interestingly, the Bio-TeNPs in the present study exhibited no antibacterial activity against S. aureus; in addition, the antibacterial effect against Gram-negative bacteria was stronger than that against Gram-positive bacteria. This suggests that the antibacterial mechanism of biogenic tellurium nanoparticles may be somewhat unique, and different from that of Bio-TeNPs produced by other plants. Additionally, the toxicity of Bio-TeNPs was evaluated on Vero-E6 cells. No cytotoxicity was observed at concentrations of 0.7 and 0.07 mg/mL and there was a certain level of toxicity at a concentration of 7 mg/mL (Figure S3). In the present study, aqueous extract obtained from thin branches was used. The branches of M. oleifera are typically discarded after maturity, as they have lower economic value compared to the seeds and flowers. The use of such material may help save on the cost of synthesis in the future.\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nIn this study, M. oleifera extract was used to synthesize Bio-TeNPs. The produced Bio-TeNPs consisted of Te(0) and some organics from M. oleifera with the diameter ranging from 20 to 50 nm. The Bio-TeNPs showed excellent antibacterial activity against various pathogens based on the results of inhibition zone tests. Further, the inhibitory capacity of Bio-TeNPs against E. coli and K. pneumoniae was demonstrated by the growth curve experiments, live/dead cell staining, and cell morphology observation. The biofilm formation of E. coli and K. pneumoniae was also noticeably inhibited by Bio-TeNPs. Additionally, the Bio-TeNPs demonstrated significant antibacterial efficacy against E. coli on glass slides, highlighting their potential for antibacterial applications. Bio-TeNPs have been proven to be highly effective antibacterial materials, suitable for various medical and environmental sanitation applications based on the results in this study. However, the antibacterial mechanism of Bio-TeNPs remains unknown and requires further investigation. Additionally, the obtained Bio-TeNPs tend to aggregate easily. In the future, the addition of dispersants and stabilizers may be considered to enhance their stability and homogeneity.\n\n6.

      "# [Furandicarboxylic Acid Dimethyl Ester (FDME) Manufacturers](https://www.sugar-energy.com/product/2-5-furandicarboxylicacid-dimethyl-ester.html)\n1. What is FDME and How is it Produced?\n\n2,5-Furandicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester (FDME) is a vital bio-based chemical intermediate that has attracted significant interest in various industries due to its renewable origins and wide range of applications. FDME is produced through the oxidation and esterification of hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), a compound derived from biomass sources like fructose and glucose. This production process makes FDME part of the broader trend towards utilizing renewable resources in chemical manufacturing, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and contributing to the sustainability of industrial processes.\n\nThe molecular structure of FDME, denoted by the formula C8H8O5, features two ester groups attached to a furan ring. This structure imparts FDME with unique chemical properties, such as its ability to easily participate in polymerization reactions. FDME has a molecular weight of 184.15 g/mol, and its physical properties further reflect its stability and usefulness in various chemical reactions. It has a melting point of 117.6℃, indicating its solid state at room temperature, and a boiling point of 270.9℃ at 760 mmHg, showing its stability under standard atmospheric conditions. Additionally, FDME has a relative density of 1.244 g/cm³, which is typical for organic esters and contributes to its ease of handling and storage.\n\nOne of the key advantages of FDME is its stability, particularly when stored in sealed containers at room temperature. This stability is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the chemical during transportation and storage, making FDME a reliable raw material for various industrial processes. The production of FDME is a relatively straightforward process, often involving catalytic oxidation of HMF followed by esterification. This process not only yields a high-purity product but also aligns with the principles of green chemistry, reducing the environmental impact of chemical production. As industries continue to seek sustainable and renewable alternatives to petrochemical-based products, FDME stands out as a promising candidate for a wide range of applications.\n\n2. Applications of FDME in Polymer Synthesis\n\nThe most prominent application of FDME lies in the polymer industry, where it is used as a key monomer in the production of polyethylene furanoate (PEF). PEF is a biobased polyester that is increasingly seen as a sustainable alternative to traditional petroleum-based plastics like polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The production of PEF involves the transesterification polymerization of FDME with ethylene glycol, resulting in a polyester that offers several advantages over PET. These advantages include superior barrier properties against gases like oxygen and carbon dioxide, which makes PEF an ideal material for packaging applications, particularly in the food and beverage industry.\n\nThe use of FDME in PEF production is not only beneficial from a performance standpoint but also from an environmental perspective. PEF is derived entirely from renewable resources, which significantly reduces the carbon footprint associated with its production compared to traditional plastics. Additionally, PEF is fully recyclable, aligning with the global push towards a circular economy where materials are reused and recycled rather than disposed of. The incorporation of FDME into PEF also enhances the material's mechanical properties, such as tensile strength and thermal stability, making it suitable for a wide range of applications beyond packaging, including textiles and automotive parts.\n\nBeyond its use in PEF, FDME is also being explored for the production of other types of polymers. Researchers are investigating the potential of FDME to create new classes of polyesters and polyamides, which could offer further improvements in properties such as biodegradability, strength, and resistance to heat and chemicals. These developments highlight the versatility of FDME as a monomer and its potential to drive innovation in the polymer industry. As demand for sustainable materials continues to grow, FDME is poised to play a critical role in the development of next-generation polymers that meet the needs of both industry and the environment.",

      "# [Multiplexed screening reveals how cancer-specific alternative polyadenylation shapes tumor growth in vivo by Austin M, Andrea E, James D, Siegen A, Taylor R, Edie I, Robert K on 2024-02-01](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-44931-x)\nGlobal 3′ UTR lengthening predicts poor patient prognosis in human melanoma\n\nTo assess whether cancer-associated changes in APA are relevant to clinical phenotypes, we tested whether global APA dysregulation was significantly associated with patient outcomes. Several prior studies have analyzed RNA sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and observed significant associations between global APA dysregulation and patient survival; however, those studies limited analyses to the 17 tumor types for which there were sufficient patient-matched, peritumoral normal tissue samples available13,15. In order to extend such analyses to all tumor types, including those for which peritumoral samples are not available, we instead took a stratification-based approach that relied on data from tumor samples alone. For each cancer subtype, we stratified patients into terciles representing whether their tumor transcriptomes preferentially expressed short, medium, or long 3′ UTRs by computing a median 3′ UTR length for each tumor across 7513 genes that are subject to alternative polyadenylation (Fig. 1A–H; Supplementary Fig. 1A–C). This measure of global 3′ UTR length was significantly positively correlated with PABPN1 expression in 28 of 30 cancer subtypes and significantly negatively correlated with CSTF2 expression in 21 of 30 cancer subtypes, consistent with PABPN1 and CSTF2’s known roles as a repressor or activator of proximal poly(A) site usage, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1D–I)5,6,7.\n\nWe then performed Kaplan–Meier survival analysis by comparing patients with short or long median 3′ UTRs and found significant survival differences that varied substantially by cancer type (Fig. 1I; Supplementary Fig. 2A–D; Supplementary Data File 1). In ovarian carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, breast carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, and lung adenocarcinoma, patients whose cancers expressed shorter 3′ UTRs exhibited significantly worse overall survival (Fig. 1J; Supplementary Fig. 2D). Several cancer subtypes displayed the opposite trend, where patients with globally lengthened 3′ UTRs exhibited significantly worse overall survival, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, low grade glioma, and cutaneous melanoma (Fig. 1I, J; Supplementary Fig. 2D). These variable associations illustrate the potentially clinically relevant roles of APA and highlight the likely complexity of the relationship between 3′ UTR length trends and prognosis.\n\nThese results are necessarily based upon computational inference of 3′ UTR length using poly(A)-selected RNA-seq data, rather than assays like 3′-seq that provide nucleotide-level resolution of 3′ UTR length, due to the nature of most patient transcriptomic data. We therefore confirmed that our results were agnostic to the specific computational algorithm used to infer 3′ UTR usage by measuring 3′ UTR length using a distinct method, APAlyzer23. We repeated our analyses for the cutaneous melanoma cohort, which demonstrated the most significant associations between 3′ UTR length and patient survival among TCGA cohorts, and found concordant and similarly strong associations between 3′ UTR length and survival (Supplementary Fig. 2E, F; Supplementary Data File 2). Together, these analyses highlight a subset of cancer types where global APA is strongly correlated with patient survival, suggesting possible functional relationships between APA and tumor growth.\n\nA mouse model of melanoma exhibits cancer-associated aberrant alternative polyadenylation\n\nMotivated by these strong associations between APA and patient prognosis, we sought to experimentally test the hypothesis that APA dysregulation affecting specific genes functionally contributes to tumorigenesis. As clinical melanoma exhibited the strongest correlations between 3′ UTR length and patient survival (Fig. 1I, J), we turned to syngeneic mouse models of untransformed melanocytes and melanoma to functionally study APA in biologically relevant and experimentally tractable systems. B16-F10 cells are mouse melanoma cells that readily engraft and form aggressive tumors in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice, while Melan-A cells are immortalized but non-tumorigenic melanocytes derived from the same C57BL/6 background (Fig. 2A)24,25. These two models therefore provided an opportunity to identify melanoma-associated APA by comparing immortalized melanocytes and melanoma cells in a consistent genetic background context.\n\nWe profiled global gene expression and poly(A) site selection in each of the two syngeneic cell lines with high-replicate RNA-seq and Poly(A)-seq (Fig. 2B). We identified significant differences in APA site selection between the two cell lines (n = 6 replicates per cell line) with APAlyzer23. This analysis revealed 654 significantly differentially polyadenylated transcripts for which differential APA site selection was supported by both Poly(A)-seq and RNA-seq (Fig. 2C–F; Supplementary Data File 3). 204 genes displayed strong correlations between APA and differential gene expression, but the majority did not, consistent with the idea that many APA events have gene- or protein-specific effects rather than simply modulating transcript levels in an easily predictable manner (Fig. 2G)4.\n\nWe next compared APA in mouse and human melanoma. For each gene, we calculated the relative distal poly(A) site use in the B16-F10 mouse melanoma model system and for the human gene ortholog in the 424 TCGA melanoma samples and then computed the Pearson correlation for those gene-level values. This analysis revealed a modest but significant positive correlation between APA in mouse and human melanoma (R = 0.24, p < 2.2 × 10−16; Supplementary Fig. 3A–C). Overall, these data demonstrate that widespread alterations in APA characterize the B16-F10 model of mouse melanoma, suggesting that it may be a useful system for dissecting the functional contributions of individual APA events to tumorigenesis.\n\nCRISPR-Cas9 paired-guide RNAs enable functional manipulation of alternative polyadenylation\n\nIn order to identify possible functional roles for the APA events that we identified in melanoma, we sought to manipulate endogenous poly(A) site selection in order to test how each APA event influenced tumor growth. We utilized a well-established approach for endogenous poly(A) site manipulation, wherein CRISPR-Cas9 paired-guide RNAs (pgRNAs) are used to precisely delete an individual poly(A) site. This approach has been previously utilized by other groups to force usage of specific poly(A) sites in Trp53, Calm1, and other genes26,27,28,29.\n\nWe tested the efficacy of this approach in our melanoma model system using Sap30l, which has two distinct poly(A) sites separated by several kilobases. B16-F10 cells expressed SAP30L mRNA overwhelmingly utilizing the proximal poly(A) site, whereas Melan-A cells utilize the distal poly(A) site significantly more (Fig. 2C, F). We generated constitutive Cas9-expressing B16-F10 cells that we then transduced with two distinct pgRNAs designed to delete the proximal polyadenylation signal sequence within the Sap30l 3′ UTR (Fig. 3A, B). Cas9-expressing B16-F10 cells treated with either pgRNA designed to knock out the proximal polyadenylation signal sequence of Sap30l, referred to as proximal knockouts (pKO), exhibited appreciable levels of genomic DNA excision at the expected site (Fig. 3C; Supplementary Fig. 4A, B). Poly(A)-seq of polyclonal cells treated with either of two distinct Sap30l pKO pgRNAs caused specific increases in use of the Sap30l distal poly(A) site (Fig. 3D; Supplementary Fig. 4C). We generated seven monoclonal lines with heterozygous excision of the proximal Sap30l polyadenylation signal, five monoclonal lines with homozygous excision, and six monoclonal negative control lines transduced with a non-targeting control (NTC) pgRNA (Supplementary Fig. 4D). Treatment with either of the two distinct Sap30l pKO pgRNAs significantly increased use of the distal polyadenylation signal sequence in both the polyclonal and monoclonal settings as measured by RT-PCR, where cells with homozygous deletion of the proximal poly(A) signal displayed the highest use of the distal poly(A) site (Fig. 3E; Supplementary Fig. 4E). Using qRT-PCR to measure SAP30L mRNA levels, we found that homozygous excision of the proximal poly(A) signal led to a median reduction in total SAP30L mRNA levels of 47.9% (Fig. 3F; p = 0.017 computed across the monoclonal isolates). Consistent with this, we observed a strong negative correlation between distal polyadenylation site usage and total mRNA abundance for Sap30l (Fig. 3G; p = 0.0084). We concluded that targeted deletion of proximal poly(A) sites using a CRISPR-Cas9 pgRNA approach can effectively force distal poly(A) site use in both polyclonal and monoclonal populations of B16-F10 cells.\n\nHigh-throughput functional screening identifies alternative polyadenylation that regulates murine melanoma growth in vitro and in vivo\n\nTo test if APA is functionally relevant in melanoma, we utilized the CRISPR-Cas9-based approach to manipulating endogenous poly(A) site selection to create a multiplexed genetic screen. We designed a custom pgRNA library targeting 143 proximal polyadenylation signal sequences that we identified as cancer-associated from our genomic analyses (Supplementary Fig. 5A; Supplementary Data File 4). Approximately 25% of these APA events were dysregulated in both human and mouse melanoma (36 targets), while 75% were specific to mouse melanoma (107 targets) (Supplementary Fig. 5B). We created downloadable BED files to visualize pgRNA library design alongside the Poly(A)-seq data from B16-F10 and Melan-A cells that we used to select targets (Supplementary Fig. 6A, B). The final library comprises 8–10 unique targeting pgRNAs per proximal poly(A) signal, 150 positive control pgRNAs designed to knock out 15 distinct genes including core essential genes and tumor suppressor genes as negative and positive controls, respectively, and 150 negative control pgRNAs targeting proximal polyadenylation signals in genes that are not expressed in B16-F10 cells. We included ample negative control pgRNAs in order to allow for accurate determination of empirical false discovery rates (FDRs) and robust statistical significance testing (Supplementary Fig. 5B)30. The resulting targeting, positive control, and negative control pgRNAs each have similar distributions of on- and off-target scores relative to pgRNA libraries that we and others have previously used for functional interrogation of tumorigenesis (Supplementary Fig. 5C, D)30,31. We then cloned this library of 1718 unique pgRNAs via oligo array cloning as previously described32 and confirmed excellent library diversity with next-generation sequencing of the final plasmid pool (Supplementary Fig. 5E, F).\n\nWe used this library to identify APA that influenced tumor growth by performing paired in vitro and in vivo screens in B16-F10 cells (Fig. 4A). In brief, we infected Cas9-expressing B16-F10 cells with the lentiviral library at an MOI of 0.2. 24 h later, we added 0.5 µg/mL puromycin, which we left for 2 days, and then cultured for one more day in puromycin-free media. We then split the cells into 8 replicates. For each replicate, we collected a day 0 fraction, plated 500,000 cells for culturing in vitro, or subcutaneously injected 500,000 cells into a mouse flank for tumor growth in vivo. After 20 days of monitored growth, cells and tumors were harvested, and total genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted using established methods33. gDNA from the plasmid pool, day 0 time points, and day 20 in vitro and in vivo time points was then PCR amplified and subjected to next-generation sequencing with ~2500-fold coverage per pgRNA.\n\nWe performed enrichment analysis and FDR computation using our previously described statistical framework30. In brief, we normalized the fold-changes relative to day 0 for a given replicate such that the median of all pgRNAs targeting poly(A) sites in unexpressed genes was equal to 1 and pooled computed fold-changes across all replicates for a given condition to maximize statistical power (Supplementary Data File 5). We then calculated a p value for significant enrichment/depletion associated with each poly(A) site target by comparing the distribution of fold-changes for all pgRNAs targeting that poly(A) site to the distribution of pgRNAs targeting poly(A) sites in unexpressed genes. We computed empirical FDRs for each targeted poly(A) site using a subsampling procedure across negative control pgRNAs targeting unexpressed genes (n = 10,000 samples).\n\nBoth positive and negative control pgRNAs performed as expected in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 4B–D; Supplementary Fig. 7A–C). pgRNAs designed to knock out genes that are essential for tumor growth exhibited marked depletion, while pgRNAs designed to delete proximal polyadenylation sites of unexpressed genes exhibited negligible enrichment or depletion, with 96.0% or 96.7% of pgRNAs falling within two standard deviations of the median fold-change for our in vitro and in vivo experiments, respectively (Fig. 4C, D; Supplementary Fig. 7A–E). In contrast, numerous pgRNAs targeting proximal polyadenylation sites of expressed genes exhibited significant enrichment or depletion, with deletion of some proximal polyadenylation sites associated with alterations in B16-F10 cell growth in vitro and in vivo of similar magnitudes to positive controls (Fig. 4C, D).\n\nWe next validated two particularly striking hits that emerged from our screen. pgRNAs targeting the proximal polyadenylation sites of Atg7 and Egln1 were strongly depleted and enriched, respectively, both in vitro and in vivo. We introduced individual pgRNAs targeting these polyadenylation sites into Cas9-expressing B16-F10 cells and systematically profiled polyadenylation site selection, protein levels, and effects on cell growth. All experiments were performed in comparison to Cas9-expressing B16-F10 cells transduced with a pgRNA targeting a poly(A) site in the unexpressed gene Crabp1, which was selected as a negative control because its normalized fold-change in the screen was close to the median of all control pgRNAs targeting poly(A) sites within unexpressed genes. These experiments confirmed that poly(A) site knock out (pKO) pgRNAs targeting Atg7 and Egln1 induced significant increases in use of the distal polyadenylation sites, as intended (Fig. 4E, H). pKO pgRNA treatment significantly reduced ATG7 protein levels but was associated with only modest alterations in EGLN1 protein levels (Fig. 4F, I). Introduction of pKO pgRNAs to force use of distal polyadenylation sites in Atg7 and Egln1 recapitulated the in vitro growth phenotypes observed in the screen format (Fig. 4G, J). Overall, these data demonstrate that multiplexed pgRNA screening effectively nominates specific APA events that influence melanoma cell growth both in vitro and in vivo.\n\nA long Atg7 3′ UTR suppresses murine melanoma growth in vitro and in vivo\n\nWe selected Atg7 for additional studies due to its significant depletion both in vitro and in vivo. We performed a rescue experiment to confirm that reduced levels of the short Atg7 isoform were responsible for the reduced cellular growth that we observed in our Atg7 pKO B16-F10 cells (Fig. 4G) by expressing transgenic Atg7 mRNA in the Atg7 pKO background and measuring cell growth. We generated a cDNA construct harboring the Atg7 coding sequence and the endogenous short Atg7 3′ UTR sequence as well as 200 nucleotides downstream of the poly(A) signal sequence (Supplementary Fig. 8A). We additionally generated a construct with the Atg7 coding sequence and an SV40 poly(A) signal. Stable integration and expression of either construct in the Atg7 pKO background restored ATG7 protein levels and rescued the cellular growth phenotype observed in Atg7 pKO cells (Supplementary Fig. 8B, C). We observed rescue of cell growth for both constructs (with the endogenous short Atg7 3′ UTR and with the SV40 poly(A) signal), suggesting that decreased ATG7 protein levels, rather than low levels of the short Atg7 3′ UTR-containing mRNA itself, underlies the reduced growth characteristic of Atg7 pKO cells.\n\nTo further characterize differences between the Atg7 short and long 3′ UTR isoforms, we completed an Actinomycin D time course to assess mRNA stability of the respective mRNAs. We found that the percent of all Atg7 mRNA utilizing the long isoform decreased relative to the fraction of total Atg7 mRNA across the Actinomycin D treatment time course (Fig. 5A, B). These data demonstrate that the Atg7 mRNA utilizing the long 3′ UTR is less stable than the Atg7 mRNA utilizing the short 3′ UTR, likely explaining at least in part the reduced protein levels we observed in B16-F10 Atg7 pKO cells (Fig. 4F).\n\nWe then sought to replicate the in vivo growth phenotype observed in the CRISPR screen for Atg7 pKO cells in focused assays. Cas9-expressing B16-F10 cells were treated with either a pKO pgRNA targeting Atg7 or a control pgRNA targeting a poly(A) site in an unexpressed gene, and then engrafted into C57BL/6 mice. Consistent with results from the multiplexed screen, Atg7 pKO tumors exhibited reduced growth in vivo, leading to significantly prolonged host survival using Kaplan–Meier survival analysis (p = 0.0053) (Fig. 5C; Supplementary Fig. 9A, B).\n\nWe next sought to understand the molecular consequences of Atg7 APA. Autophagy related protein 7, ATG7, is considered a critical protein for autophagosome formation and function, and loss of ATG7 protein inhibits autophagy34. We therefore investigated the consequences of Atg7 APA for autophagy. Complete Atg7 knock out and consequent loss of ATG7 protein caused a significant increase in p62 protein levels, as expected (Supplementary Fig. 10A). In contrast, treating cells with an Atg7 pKO pgRNA to force distal polyadenylation site usage did not cause detectable deficits in autophagy at baseline or following exposure to serum and amino acid starvation, measured by both p62 accumulation and a flow cytometry-based LC3-GFP-mCherry reporter (Supplementary Fig. 10A–E)35. These results are distinct from a previous study reporting that ATG7 3′ UTR lengthening was associated with autophagy inhibition in pro-B cells, a difference that may be attributable to cell type-specific effects or that study’s reliance on KD of all ATG7 isoforms for functional studies rather than specific manipulation of poly(A) site usage36. Although forcing distal polyadenylation site usage reduced ATG7 protein levels by ~60% (Fig. 4F; Supplementary Fig. 10A), we detected none of the autophagy impairment that was readily apparent upon Atg7 KO, highlighting the utility of directly manipulating poly(A) site usage for functional inference.\n\nWe next performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the Ki67 proliferation marker on control and Atg7 pKO tumors. Although Atg7 pKO tumors grew slower (Fig. 5C; Supplementary Fig. 9A, B), they exhibited a significantly higher fraction of nuclei with moderate and strong Ki67 staining relative to control tumors (Fig. 5D, E; Supplementary Fig. 9C, D). The levels of Ki67 fluctuate significantly throughout the cell cycle, with RNA and protein levels rising through S phase and peaking in G2/M phase37. We therefore performed cell cycle analysis with propidium iodide staining and found that Atg7 pKO increased the fraction of B16-F10 cells in S phase and G2/M phase. These altered cell cycle kinetics are consistent with the increased Ki67 staining intensity observed by tumor IHC and concordant with a previous study demonstrating that ATG7 KD by siRNA in human bladder cancer cells increased the fraction of cells in S phase and G2/M phase (Fig. 5F; Supplementary Fig. 9E, F)38.\n\nAtg7 undergoes APA in both mouse and human cells, raising the possibility that ATG7 3′ UTR length could influence human melanoma growth just as it does mouse melanoma. We first assessed mutation status of ATG7 across the 424 patients in TCGA’s melanoma cohort. No nonsense, frame-disrupting, or recurrent missense mutations were observed across this cohort, confirming that ATG7 is not a common mutational target in clinical melanoma (Fig. 5G). We then performed Kaplan–Meier survival analysis after stratifying these 424 cutaneous melanoma patients by ATG7 3′ UTR length. We observed that patients whose tumors expressed a longer ATG7 3′ UTR exhibited significantly better progression-free survival, consistent with our finding that forcing long Atg7 3′ UTR usage slowed mouse melanoma growth (Fig. 5H). Given this strong association between ATG7 APA and survival that we observed in both mouse and clinical human cancer, it is interesting to speculate that ATG7 APA provides a post-transcriptional mechanism by which cancers may regulate ATG7 protein levels to influence their growth even in the absence of ATG7 mutations.\n\nAnimal use\n\nAll animal work and procedures were completed in accordance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Six-week-old C57BL/6 male mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory for all animal experiments listed here. Animals were housed for 1 week prior to initiation of any experiments in line with IACUC guidance.\n\nCell lines and culture\n\nB16-F10 cells were obtained from ATCC (CRL-6475) and cultured per the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell lines tested negative for mycoplasma contamination. Cell lines were authenticated via RNA-seq expression profiling. B16-F10 cells were also spot checked as they express melanin and cell pellets are black (no other cell lines in use are black when pelleted). The Melan-A cell line was obtained from the Wellcome Trust Functional Genomics Cell Bank and cultured per their instructions24. B16-F10 cells were infected at 0.3 MOI with Cas9 lentivirus (Addgene 52962-LV) and selected with 2 ug/mL Blasticidin for 7 days. Polyclonal cells were then single cell sorted, and individual clones were assessed for on-target editing efficiency, all subsequent CRISPR assays were completed with this B16-F10 Cas9 clone with the highest editing rate.\n\nPoly(A)-Seq library preparation\n\nRNA was isolated from cell pellets with the Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research). Protocol was adapted from Derti et al.1. In brief, 5 µg of RNA was heated at 65° for 2 min and then placed on ice. Poly(A) selected mRNA was isolated using DynaBeads (ThermoFisher 61006) per the manufacturer’s instructions. 1st strand cDNA synthesis using SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase (ThermoFisher 18090010) and the primer RKB4087 (a modified oligo d(TVN) primer) to generate cDNA reads which begin synthesis just before the poly(A) tail. This mixture was then purified using a 2x SPRI bead clean up and then followed by 2nd strand synthesis and then a 1x SPRI bead clean up. This cDNA library was then subject to PCR (NEBNext High Fidelity 2x Master Mix) and primers RKB4089 (universal primer) and RKB4090-RKB4101 (indexed primers). Specific primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Data 6. The final libraries generate a broad range of fragment sizes, as such we gel extracted libraries from a 2% agarose gel corresponding to 300–500 bp size. Following extraction and purification, library size was analyzed with a 4200 TapeStation System before sequencing.\n\nRNA-seq library preparation\n\nRNA was isolated from cell pellets with the Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research). Poly(A)-selected, unstranded Illumina libraries were prepared following the TruSeq protocol per the manufacturer’s instructions. Library size and distribution was analyzed with a 4200 TapeStation System before sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq as 2 × 50 bp to obtain ~40 million reads per sample.\n\nRNA-seq and Poly(A)-seq data analysis\n\nRNA-seq was analyzed as previously described45. RNA-seq reads were mapped to an annotated transcriptome created using Ensembl 7145,46, UCSC knownGene47 and Misov2.048 annotations using RSEM version 1.2.449 (modified to call Bowtie50 with option ‘-v 2’). Unaligned reads were then mapped to the corresponding genome (hg19/GRCh37 assembly, mm10/GRCmc38 assembly) and a database containing all possible pairings of 5’ and 3′ splice sites per gene in our merged transcriptome annotation using TopHat version 20.8b51. Mapped reads were then merged and input into MISO v2.0. For TCGA studies, we analyzed 9045 available samples across 29 cancer types.\n\nFor Poly(A)-seq, data was mapped similarly but in a stranded fashion. BAM files were input into the APAlyzer package in R23 and the gene level log2(distal reads/proximal reads) was computed per sample for each respective strand.\n\nSurvival analyses\n\nCancer type abbreviations are the same as TCGA standards (https://gdc.cancer.gov/resources-tcga-users/tcga-code-tables/tcga-study-abbreviations). Survival analyses were completed with the Kaplan–Meier estimator and statistical test were performed with a logrank test (R package survival). Stratification per cancer subtype was completed for Fig. 1b, Supplementary Figs. 1A–C and 2A–F by computing the median 3′ UTR length per sample and dividing each cancer subtype into terciles (short, medium and long) and comparing the short (≤33%) vs long (≥66%) bins. Gene level 3′ UTR measurements were downloaded from a previously published database52 or computed using the APAlyzer package in R23.\n\nFor Fig. 5F, patients from the TCGA SKCM cohort were stratified based on the ATG7 3 UTR length per sample, again into terciles and downstream analyses were performed identically as described above.\n\npgRNA library construction and cloning\n\nTarget genes selected from the Poly(A) sequencing and TCGA SKCM analysis were largely selected based on manual inspection of BAM coverage plot quality. For each gene, the most utilized APA sites within the 3′ UTR were identified from PolyA-DB, filtered based off number of tissues where a particular APA site is utilized and the fraction of samples it has been detected in23. Of those Poly(A) sites, the most proximal site was selected for targeting. The 100 base-pairs up and downstream of the given poly(A) site were selected as the genomic window wherein all possible gRNAs were generated using Guidescan Version 1.053. The downloaded gRNAs were then identified as up or downstream of the poly(A) signal (PAS), and then the guides were combined in a pairwise fashion to generate all possible pgRNAs which disrupt the poly(A) signal sequence. For each target we excluded gRNAs with more than two two-nucleotide off-target sites, more than thirty three-nucleotide off-target sites or an on-target editing efficiency of less than thirty according to Rule Set 2 scoring54. All input target sites were then filtered to only include targets with at least eight pgRNAs. For sites with more than ten possible pgRNAs, pgRNAs were ranked based first on targeting efficiency and then specificity to select the ten pgRNAs to be utilized in the library. This same process was used to generate all possible pgRNAs targeting highly utilized PAS sites of genes that are not expressed in B16-F10 or Melan-A cells. In this control library, 150 pgRNAs were selected randomly as controls to be included in the library, of note this random selection process was run several times until the distribution of control pgRNAs matched the true library in terms of efficiency and specificity. An additional 15 genes were included as growth controls based on previous literature, either core essential genes identified from DepMap or genes which promote more rapid B16-F10 cell growth in vivo identified by mining data generated from previous genome wide gene knock out CRISPR screens in B16-F10 cells55.\n\ngDNA PCR and on-target editing verification\n\ngDNA was extracted using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen) per the manufacturer’s protocol. A window around the Sap30l proximal poly(A) site was selected to allow for simple detection of deletion by band separation on gel electrophoresis. PCR amplicons were then purified and submitted for AmpliconEZ sequencing (Azenta/Genewiz). Reads were trimmed, mapped and the fraction of reads with an intact or disrupted poly(A) signal sequence were identified using the CRISPresso2 software56,57. Specific primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Data 6.\n\npgRNA screen\n\n9 × 107 Cas9 expressing B16-F10cells were infected at an MOI of 0.2. Twenty-four hours post infection, cells were then selected with 1 µg/mL Puromycin for 48 h. Remaining cells were then pooled and divided into eight replicates. 500,000 cells were isolated from each replicated and frozen as a time point 0. Of the remaining cells, 500,000 cells were then plated into 10 cm plates and another 500,000 cells were injected subcutaneously into C57BL/6 mice. Cells grown in culture were passed every 3–4 days, and tumors were monitored and then harvested when reaching 1.5 cm in any single dimension or after 20 days, whichever condition was met first. On the day a given tumor was harvested, digested and frozen, the corresponding cells growing in vitro were also frozen. gDNA was then extracted from all samples using previously published methods33, and quantified via Nanodrop. 1.5 µg of each sample was then utilized as input for PCR to amplify out integrated pgRNA constructs as previously described30,31. Final, purified libraries were then submitted for Next-Generation Sequencing using a custom approach performed as previously described.\n\npgRNA sequencing and data analysis\n\nAnalyses were performed identically as previously described30. In brief, each read includes independent reads for gRNA1 and gRNA2 as well as an index read. Each gRNA was separately mapped to a database of pgRNAs using BowTie, and correct pairings were identified by ensuring gRNA1 and gRNA2 come from the same pgRNA, incorrect pairings were discarded. We generated a per pgRNA pseudocount which was added to the raw counts and served to regularize the fold-change computations so that they are proportional to the relative representation of each individual pgRNA in the library.\n\nFold-changes were then computed by comparing each time point to the counts at the day 0 time point. These fold-changes were then normalized so that the median of all pgRNAs targeting poly(A) sites in unexpressed genes (150 pgRNAs in total) was equal to 1. For each poly(A) site target or gene KO control target a p value was computed by comparing the distribution of normalized log2 fold-changes per pgRNA (8–10 per target) to the distribution of all 150 pgRNAs targeting poly(A) sites in unexpressed genes using a two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test. FDRs were computed by generating a distribution of fake target p values by randomly subsampling 10 pgRNAs from our control pgRNAs 10,000 times to estimate the distribution of expected p values. We then estimated FDR per real poly(A) site or gene KO target via the cumulative distribution function of the distribution of the fake target p values.\n\nIn vitro validation studies\n\nCas9 expressing B16-F10 cells were grown in standard conditions and then transduced with lentivirus containing indicated pgRNAs and then selected in 1 µg/mL Puromycin for 72 h. For cell growth assays, 100,000 cells were plated into each well of a 24 well plate and 20% of the well was passaged every 2 days into a new 24 well plate. 100 µL of the remaining cell suspension was used as input for a CellTiter-Glo (ProMega Catalog Number G9242) assay performed per the manufacturer’s instructions.\n\nIn vivo validation studies\n\nCas9 expressing B16-F10 cells were grown in standard conditions and then transduced with lentivirus containing indicated pgRNAs and then selected in 1 µg/mL Puromycin for 72 h. 5 × 106 cells were then injected subcutaneously into each flank of adult male C57BL/6 mice, and monitored using calipers. Animals were euthanized when a tumor reached 1.5 cm in any dimension in accordance with IACUC guidelines, and no tumors ever exceeded this threshold in any dimension. Tumor material was isolated either for an archived flash frozen sample, fixed in 10% formalin at room temperature for histology studies or placed in TRIzol reagent (ThermoFisher 15596018) for subsequent RNA isolation.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\n\nTissues from tumors were processed, embedded and stained through the Fred Hutch Experimental Histopathology core. Mouse Ki-67 (CST Clone 12202 1:2000 dilution) staining was performed using a rabbit monoclonal antibody. Staining was performed with a BOND RX autostainer (Leica Biosystems) and images were then acquired with an Aperio ImageScope at 40x magnification (Leica Biosystems). Image analysis was completed using HALO Image Analysis software.\n\nRT-PCR analyses\n\nRNA was isolated using the Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep (Zymo Research). SuperScript IV reverse Transcriptase was used to synthesize cDNA per the manufacturer’s instructions, but using a specific oligo d(TVN) primer to amplify the DNA directly upstream of the poly(A) tail (ThermoFisher Scientific). Nested RT-PCR was performed with a universal poly(A) tail primer and two gene specific primers to amplify the 3′ UTR. The final product visualized using agarose gel electrophoresis and band intensity quantification was performed with FIJI/ImageJ and reported as the percent distal isoform (pdi) defined as the percent of total signal arising from bands corresponding to distal poly(A) site use. For the Actinomycin D treatment time course, cells were plated and treated with 1 µg/mL Actinomycin D (Sigma-Aldrich A1410-2MG) for the indicated time frame, whereafter cells were harvested and RNA was isolated as described above. Specific primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Data 6.\n\nWestern blotting\n\nTotal protein lysates were isolated in 1x RIPA buffer and quantified with the Pierce 660 nm Protein Assay Reagent. Total protein lysates were electrophoretically separated and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using the NuPAGE system (ThermoFisher Scientific). Each membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature and then probed with primary antibody diluted in a blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. Atg7 (AbCam Ab133528, 1:1000), Egln1 (Cell-Signaling Technology D31E11, 1:1000), p62/Sqstm1 (AbCam Ab109012, 1:1000), and Alpha-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich Clone DM1, 1:2000) primary antibodies were used. Anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IRDye (LI-COR Biosciences) secondary antibodies and the Odyssey CLx Imager (LI-COR Biosciences) were utilized for detection and imaging.\n\nFluorescent LC3 reporter assay\n\nThe FUW mCherry-GFP-LC3 reporter plasmid was obtained from Addgene (Plasmid #110060) which was utilized to generate lentivirus in 293 T cells. B16-F10 Cas9-expressing cells were then infected and grown for 48 h. Cells were then plated and treated with standard DMEM with 10% FBS or Hanks Balanced Salt Solution for the indicated time. Following the time course all cells were washed 3x with PBS and then resuspended in 100 uL of PBS and stained with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Violet (ThermoFisher L34955) stain per the manufacturer’s instructions.\n\nCells were then passed through a 40-micron filter to generate a single cell suspension and then run on a BD FACSCelesta. Single cells were gated for live cells and then the individual GFP and mCherry signal were measured in the FITC and CF594 channels, respectively. Data were analyzed in FlowJo v10.\n\nStatistics and reproducibility\n\nStatistical analyses were performed in the R with Bioconductor, and tables and plots were generated using dplyr58 and ggplot259 packages. All cancer type abbreviations follow TCGA standards (https://gdc.cancer.gov/resources-tcga-users/tcga-code-tables/tcga-study-abbreviations). All box plots follow the same formatting, where the middle line indicates the median, the hinges represent the 25th and 75th percentile, notches indicate the 95% confidence interval, and whiskers represent the most extreme data point within 1.5x the interquartile range from hinge Sample sizes for in vivo validation experiments were based off power analysis to reliably detect a 25% reduction in tumor growth with greater than 90% confidence incorporating measured standard error rates from previous in vivo experiments30.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article."
