      "# [The influence of bio-based monomers on the structure and thermal properties of polyurethanes on 2024-11-23](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-80358-6)\nCommercial, polyurethanes (PU)s are obtained by the polyaddition reaction of di- or polyisocyanates with polyols and chain extenders1,2,3. Polyols and isocyanates are the main components of the formulation, which significantly determine the properties of the PU materials4,5. The amount of isocyanate in the formulation is generally around 30–40 parts by weight. The isocyanate-derived parts of PU structure can form hard segments (HS), which are responsible for the hardness, mechanical strength, and thermal stability of PU materials6,7,8. Unfortunately, the commercial-available isocyanates are of petrochemical origin, obtained by the reaction of amines with toxic phosgene. Isocyanate synthesis is highly unfavorable, dangerous to human health and not environmentally friendly7,9,10. Therefore, research has been carried out to find alternative and more environmentally friendly solutions to produce isocyanates using a safer synthesis route and non-petrochemical raw materials11.\n\nUp to now, only a few bio-based polyisocyanates have been described in the literature12,13,14. Commercially available polyisocyanates are mainly derived from plants (fatty acids). Currently, there are three main types of bio-based isocyanates on the market: 1,5-penthamethylene diisocyanate (PDI) and its oligomers; L-lysine ethyl ester diisocyanate (LDI)15; and diisocyanate derived from 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) and palm oil16. Covestro produces bio-derived PDI from plant sugars using a synthesis process that significantly reduces energy consumption. The PDI has a green carbon content of over 71% and although this bio-based monomer is not commercially available, it is further used to synthesize an aliphatic PDI trimer. This trimer is available on the market under the trade name DESMODUR® eco N 730017 and is dedicated to the synthesis of PU coating systems that are resistant to light, weather, and scratches17.\n\nAliphatic polyisocyanurates based on bio-based 1,5-pentamethylene diisocyanate is produced by Mitsui Chemicals under the trade name STABIO™ PDI. The offered monomer is available in two variants with low and high viscosity. The company recommends to use it for the synthesis of PU-urea materials18.\n\nAnother bio-based diisocyanate producer is Vencorex Chemicals, which offers an aliphatic bio-monomer under the trade name Tolonate™ X FLO 100. It is obtained from vegetable oil derivatives with a green carbon content of up to 32%. This monomer is used for the synthesis of elastomers and PU coatings16. As the exact chemical formula of this diisocyanate was not disclosed by the manufacturer, the authors of the publication “Fully Bio-Based Thermosetting Polyurethanes from Bio-Based Polyols and Isocyanates” proposed its structure based on electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS negative)19. Based on this, Tolonate™ X FLO 100 contains a long-chain side group (labelled RO-) derived from vegetable oils. This complicates the synthesis of PUs due to the presence of additional functional groups and double bonds in the RO- labeled bio-diisocyanate fragment, resulting in additional cross-linking of the material.\n\nThe raw materials market for the synthesis of PUs also includes L-lysine ethyl ester bio-diisocyanate (LDI)20. It is produced from the amino acid L-lysine extracted from plant biomass. The LDI-based PUs exhibit low toxicity and biodegradability21.\n\nFurthermore, companies like General Mills Inc22,23. and BASF Europe24 have developed isocyanates derived from fatty acid dimers. These innovative compounds have found applications in multiple industries, particularly in the production of ultraviolet-curable coatings, where they offer enhanced performance and sustainability.\n\nIt is well known that some applications require PUs to have special properties, including resistance to very high temperatures. For example, high-temperature resistant adhesives are required in advanced aircraft, rockets, and ground vehicles25. Therefore, an important parameter determined in the analysis of PU materials is their thermal stability, which describes the thermal durability of PU26. Polymers with higher thermal stability have higher melting, softening, and thermal decomposition temperatures, lower weight loss during heating at high temperatures, without losing their basic properties27. Various tests are carried out to evaluate these properties, including thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) or differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). This paper focuses on a detailed analysis of the structure and thermal stability of the obtained bio-based PUs as promising alternatives to the current petrochemical PUs.\n\nIn this work, renewable monomers were used to synthesize bio-based PU by polyaddition reaction. The reference PU materials were prepared from the petrochemical polyols and hexamethylene diisocyanate, using 1,3-propanediol as a chain extender. Meanwhile, the preparation of polyurethanes based on bio-based monomers with desired thermal properties remains an open challenge. Here, we describe the synthesis and characterization of novel polyurethanes based on bio-based PO3G (polyether polyol), semi-crystalline, bio-based polyester polyol (Priplast 3294), and partially bio-based isocyanate Tolonate X FLO 100 with bio-based chain extender 1,3-propanediol. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Small and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SWAXS) were used to characterize all samples. The thermal properties of PUs were studied by TGA, DSC, DMTA and combination of FTIR spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis (TG-FTIR).\n\nMaterials\n\nFor reference samples, two types of polyols were used: polyether polyol - poly(tetramethylene glycol) (PTMG) supplied by Overlack (Ozorków, Poland) and polyester polyol - Polios 55/20 purchased from Purinova (Bydgoszcz Poland) both with a molecular weight of 2000 g/mol. Hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI), 1,3-propanediol (PDO) and catalyst dibutyltin dilaurate were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Saint Louis, USA) and used as received. The reaction inhibitor was orthophosphoric acid supplied by POCH Gliwice (Gliwice, Poland).\n\nFor the synthesis based on renewable raw materials we used aliphatic isocyanate Tolonate X FLO 100 purchased from Vencorex (Saint-Priest, France) and two types of polyols: polyester polyol - PRIPLAST 3294™ purchased from Croda (Snaith, UK) and polyether polyol - Velvetol H2000 supplied by Allessa GmbH (Frankfurt, Germany) both with a molecular weight of 2000 g/mol. The chain extender Zemea (1,3-propanediol) was purchased from DuPont Tate & Lyle Bio Product (Naucalpan de Juárez, USA). The same catalyst and inhibitor were used as for the reference samples. The chemicals were used without further purification unless stated otherwise.\n\nSynthesis of PU elastomers\n\nThe PUs were obtained using a two-step prepolymer method. The first step was to synthesize the prepolymer by reacting the polyol with an excess of diisocyanate at 85 °C for 2 h under vacuum. During the reaction, the percentage of NCO groups were determined by titration according to ISO 14896:2010 (isocyanate is reacted with an excess of n-dibutyl amine to form substituted ureas. The excess dibutyl amine is then back-titrated with aqueous hydrochloric acid. The solvent used is acetone). A chain extender and catalyst (0.1% DBTL) were then added to the prepolymer, and the mixture was stirred for 60 s. and degassed under vacuum for 60 s. The molar ratios of [NCO]/[OH] groups was 1.05. Finally, the materials were cured in a laboratory oven at 80-100 °C for 24 h. Figure 1 shows the overall method for the synthesis of ethers and ester-urethanes from bio-based monomers. Table 1 presents the formulation of the synthesized samples, the content of unreacted isocyanate groups in prepolymers (NCO content) and the content of HS. The content of bio-monomers (bio-content) was calculated using Eq. (1) and is given in Table 1.\n\n$$\\:bio-content=\\:\\frac{{M}_{BIO}}{{M}_{TOTAL}}\\times\\:100\\varvec{\\%}$$\n\n(1)\n\n\\(\\:{M}_{BIO}\\) - the molar mass of the used bio-monomers. \\(\\:{M}_{TOTAL}\\) – the molar mass of all substrates used.\n\nMethods of characterization\n\nFourier transform infrared spectroscopy\n\nThe chemical structure of the bio-based PU was analyzed by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy using a Spectrum 100T FT-IR spectrometer with universal ATR accessory (PerkinElmer, USA). Each spectrum was recorded at room temperature for wavenumber range of 500 to 4500 cm− 1 with a resolution of 4 cm− 1.\n\nThe degree of the carbonyl groups participating in hydrogen bonding can be described by the carbonyl.\n\nhydrogen bonding index, R, as given in Eq. (2).\n\n$$\\:R=\\frac{{A}_{bonded}}{{A}_{free}}$$\n\n(2)\n\nwhere A is the intensity of the characteristic absorbance (AH−bonded – absorption intensity of hydrogen-bonded carbonyl; AH−free – absorption intensity of free carbonyl). The degree of phase separation (DPS) and the degree of phase mixing (DPM) can be obtained by using Eqs. (3) and (4), respectively.\n\n$$\\:DPS=\\:\\frac{R}{R+1}$$\n\n(3)\n\n$$\\:DPM=1-DPS$$\n\n(4)\n\nNuclear magnetic resonance\n\n1H NMR spectra of prepared solutions (DMSO or DMF) were acquired with the Bruker Avance III spectrometer operating at 600.2 MHz. The width of 90° pulse was 18 µs, relaxation delay 10 s, acquisition time 2.73 s, 32 scans.\n\nSmall and wide-angle X-ray scattering\n\nThe internal microstructure of PU samples was investigated through Small-Angle and Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS and WAXS) analysis. The measurements were conducted using a pinhole camera (MolMet, Rigaku, Japan, modified by SAXSLAB/Xenocs) connected to a microfocused X-ray beam generator (Rigaku MicroMax 003) operating at 50 kV and 0.6 mA (30 W). Scattering intensities were recorded using a vacuum-compatible hybrid photon-counting detector (Pilatus3 R 300 K), with a sample-to-detector distance of 1000 mm (SAXS) and 50 mm (WAXS), respectively, using an exposure time of 3 h.\n\nThermogravimetric analysis\n\nTGA of the PUs were performed using a Pyris 1 TGA Thermogravimetric Analyzer (PerkinElmer, USA). Approximately 10 mg of the sample was placed in a ceramic crucible and heated from 35 to 600 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min under a nitrogen flow of 20 mL/min. The standard deviation of the TGA measurement was under 5%.\n\nDifferential scanning calorimetry\n\nThe thermal behaviour of the polyurethanes was evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) using a TG 209F1 Libra (NETZSCH, Germany). The samples (5–10 mg) were encapsulated in aluminium hermetic pans. The measurements were carried out in a heating-cooling-heating cycle at the temperature range of (-80) – 250 °C. The analyses were performed at a heating rate of 10 °C/min in an inert (nitrogen) atmosphere.\n\nThermogravimetric analysis coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy\n\nThermogravimetric analysis coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR) was carried out using a Netzsch TG 209 thermal analyser (heating rate = 10 K/min, sample mass 10–15 mg, nitrogen flow = 20 ml/min) and a Bruker Alpha FTIR spectrometer. IR spectra were recorded in the spectral range of 4000–500 cm− 1 with a 4 cm− 1 resolution and 8 scans.\n\nDynamic mechanical and thermal analysis\n\nDynamic-mechanical and thermal analysis (DMTA) of the prepared PU samples was measured on an ARES G2 rheometer (TA Instruments). Oscillatory shear deformation (0.02–1% strain) at a frequency of 1 Hz from − 100 °C to 150 °C at a temperature ramp rate of 3 °C/min was applied on rectangular samples (20 × 5 × 2 mm). The temperature dependence of the complex shear modulus (G*) was observed and the main transition temperature (Tα) was determined to be the tan δ peak maximum.\n\nFourier transform infrared spectroscopy\n\nThe chemical structure of the PUs was confirmed by FTIR-ATR and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The FTIR spectra are shown in Fig. 2 and the characteristic bands are given in Table 2. The characteristic isocyanate (-N = C = O) and polyol (-OH) bands at 2260 cm− 1 and 3600 cm− 1, respectively, were not observed in any of the samples28. Meanwhile, the bands corresponding to the urethane groups in the range of 3400–3300 cm− 1 and the I amide band in the range of 1740–1680 cm− 1 characteristic for the vibration of the -C = O group, confirm the full rearrangement of substrates29,30. At 1528–1540 cm− 1 two vibrations were assigned to the urethane CN-H group part: a bending vibration for N–H and a stretching vibration for C–N. The band at 2937–2850 cm− 1 can be assigned to symmetric and asymmetric CH stretching vibrations originating from the CH2 groups present in aliphatic chains, or from the CH3 groups. The next bands are: stretching vibrations of C–O–C in ether bonds at 1160 –1060 cm− 1 and in ester bonds at 1250 –1150 cm− 1.\n\nThe graphs show no significant differences in structure between the reference samples and bio-PUs, confirming the possibility of obtaining PU from bio-based monomers.\n\nThe obtained values of R, DPS and DPM for PU were given in Table 3. The DPS value describes the contribution of HS bonded among themselves by hydrogen bonds, while the DPM value describes the contribution of HS not bonded by hydrogen bonds to any other HS31. As has been previously reported in the literature, the DPS value in PUs increases with increasing R32. The HPTP sample has the highest value of R and therefore shows the highest phase separation compared to other samples. It was confirmed that the content of HS in the PU structure and the origin of the substrates used in the synthesis affect the DPS value. It was observed that as the HS content increases, DPS decreases. This is related to the fact that materials with a higher content of HS have more urethane groups, which can bond with the ester groups of polyols, increasing interactions between HS and SS and resulting in phase mixing. It was also observed that materials obtained from petrochemical monomers have higher DPS contents. This is in line with reports from other authors who also observed that the highest DPS value was recorded for HDI-based materials. This may be related to the linear structure of this isocyanate33. Moreover, differences were observed due to the nature of the polyol used. PUs based on polyether polyols were characterized by higher DPS values compared to PUs based on polyester polyols. For samples containing branched HS, i.e. based on bio-isocyanate, a decrease in DPS values was observed, probably due to the higher free volume between macromolecules, which hinders the formation of hydrogen bonds.\n\nNuclear magnetic resonance\n\n1H NMR spectra with a description of signals of the samples dissolved in DMSO and DMF are presented in Table 4. The type of solvent was determined by the solubility of the materials tested (due to the limited solubility of the TPTbP and TPribP samples, their spectra were prepared for prepolymers). The signals labeled a (in DMF), f (in DMSO) and k (TPribP in DMSO) in the range of 6.9–8.5 ppm are assigned to -NH in the urethane group. The peaks from 4.0 to 4.3 ppm indicate, hydrogen present in the main chain next to oxygen in the structure of this material. The range 1.2–1.7 corresponds to the protons of the methylene groups derived from the aliphatic chains of the polyol. The peaks in the range of 2.9–3.2 are related to the methylene bridge attached to the urethane nitrogen. FTIR and 1H NMR analyses confirmed the reaction of the -NCO groups of the diisocyanate with the -OH groups of the polyol used, as a signal characteristic of the protons of the -NH group was observed.\n\nX-ray scattering\n\nAll PU samples exhibit two distinct peaks in their SAXS profiles (Fig. 3), though the peak positions vary between samples. These peak positions, along with the corresponding characteristic sizes, are summarized in Table 5. The peak at lower Q-values is attributed to the microphase separation between the soft and hard segments, while the higher-Q peak corresponds to the periodic structure within the hard segment domains.\n\nFor samples containing HDI-based isocyanate, both peaks shift to higher Q-values, indicating a more compact or tightly packed structure, with smaller domain sizes. Additionally, the reduced intensity of the second peak suggests a lower hard segment (HS) content or reduced crystallinity, reflecting fewer or less well-defined hard segment domains.\n\nThe Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (WAXS) curves (Fig. 4) reveal differences in short-range ordering between the HDI-based and Tolonate-based PU samples. These differences are likely due to variations in polymer chain arrangement and crystalline domain structure. The HDI-based samples exhibit several additional diffraction peaks, suggesting the presence of more complex or diverse structural motifs compared to the Tolonate-based PUs.\n\nDifferential scanning calorimetry\n\nThe glass transition temperature (Tg) is an important characteristic of polymeric materials because it represents the boundary between their elastic and viscoelastic behavior. Figures 5 and 6 present DSC thermograms obtained from DSC experiments during the first and second heating of PUs.\n\nThermal behavior of the obtained materials such as, glass transition temperature of SS (TgSS) and HS (TgHS), melting point of SS (TmSS) and HS (TmHS), and enthalpy are presented in Table 6. The Tg values mainly depended on the type of monomers. Glass transition temperatures for SS and HS and melting points for SS and HS were observed. During the first heating in the DSC, we observe melting temperatures for the reference samples, while no melting peaks are detected for the bio-based PU. This confirms our observations from the WAXS results, which show negligible crystallinity for the bio-PU, whereas the reference PU samples have a significantly higher crystalline content (17.5% for HPoP and 24.4% for HPTP). During the 2nd heating the glass transition temperature for SS is mainly observed for polyester based samples. The Tg of the soft segments ranged from − 47.4 °C to -55 °C. The lack of a distinct glass transition peak for polyether-based samples may be related to the morphological characteristics of these materials. The flexibility of the polyether-based segments could reduce the sharpness of the glass transition, making it difficult to observe a distinct Tg peak. On the other hand, melting of the soft segments is observed for the polyether-based samples and the TPobP (polyester-based) sample. This is related to the reorganization of the soft segment microdomains after the second heating cycle, as a result of the removal of the sample’s thermal history during the first heating34. The transition observed for TPTbP sample during the second heating cycle at 22.9 °C was attributed to some relaxation effects of the polymer chain. A melting of the hard segments is observed for the reference samples during 1st and 2nd heating. This may be related to the higher DPS value of these samples. Because HDI-based samples have a more ordered structure than Tolonate-based samples28.\n\nThermogravimetry\n\nTGA is used to measure thermal decomposition and thermal stability of materials. The TGA measurements were carried out on PUs based on both bio-based monomers and petrochemical feedstocks. The aim was to investigate the thermal stability of the prepared materials and to determine the influence of the bio-based substrates on the final properties of the product. The TG and DTG curves are shown in Figs. 7 and 8. Table 7 shows the temperatures for 5%, 50% and 90% mass loss and the ash residue in mass % at 600 °C.\n\nAs it can be observed all samples exhibited two steps of degradation. The first step is attributed to the decomposition of HS, including mainly isocyanate residues and chain extenders. This is caused by the relatively low thermal stability of the urethane groups35. In contrast, the second step is attributed to the decomposition of SS, which is mainly composed of long polyol chains.\n\nFrom the TG curves, it was observed that they are almost superposed, while the DTG curves are only partially overlapped. The bio-based PUs are slightly less stable than the reference samples because their initial decomposition temperature is lower (see Table 7).\n\nThe temperatures for the first step of mass loss are similar, ranging from 237 °C to 248 °C for samples based on polyester, and 238–251 °C for samples based on polyether. Therefore, we can conclude that polyether-based samples are more stable than those on polyester. This is related to the different structures of the polyols (symmetrical and short chain of Velvetol and PTMG, long chain of Polios, branched chain of Priplast). Furthermore, it can be observed that PUs derived from bio-isocyanates degraded at a lower temperature than those based on petrochemical HDI. For comparison, 5% weight loss of HPTP sample occurs at T = 297 °C, and TPTbP sample at T = 284 °C. This is related to the lower thermal stability of bio-based isocyanate compared to the stability of HDI. As the thermal stability of isocyanates is closely related to the symmetry of their structure27. When the symmetry of the isocyanate increases, the stability of the PU increases, so Tolonate X FLO 100 has a lower stability due to its branched structure. However, our Tolonate-based samples had only slightly lower thermal stability than those reported by other scientists, also based on Tolonate and Velvetol (with a different polyol mass, we used 2000 g/mol versus 500 g/mol), where the T5% was 292 °C19.\n\nThermogravimetric analysis coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy\n\nThe gases produced during TGA of the samples at different temperatures (50–800 °C) were analyzed by FTIR spectroscopy. Analysis of the spectra of volatile decomposition products confirmed the relationships presented in the TGA figures. Decomposition of HS occurs in the first step and, according to the literature, leads to the formation of isocyanate and alcohol, primary or secondary amine, olefin, and carbon dioxide8,36. Meanwhile, in the second step, decomposition of SS consisting of polyols occurs. Temperatures in the range of 343–429 °C were chosen as the most representative points to illustrate characteristic groups of gas products.\n\nAll of the FTIR spectra shown in Fig. 9 exhibit absorption bands typical of carbon dioxide, at a wavenumber in the range 2391–2344 cm− 1, associated with asymmetric stretching vibrations, at 696–668 cm− 1, attributed to degenerate bending vibrations, and at 3598–3350 cm− 1 corresponding to combination bands. The spectrum also reveals bands at 2941–2928 cm− 1 and 2865–2849 cm− 1, characteristic of asymmetric and symmetric C-H stretching vibrations, and at 1479–1450 cm− 1, characteristic of asymmetric and symmetric C-H bending vibrations, of methylene and methyl groups.\n\nThe presence of a band at 1060–1067 cm− 1 confirms the formation of primary alcohols, associated with C-O stretching vibrations, and at 3649 –3626 cm− 1, associated with O-H stretching vibrations.\n\nDynamic mechanical and thermal analysis\n\nThe DMTA results show us the supramolecular arrangement of prepared PUs (Fig. 10). The storage modulus curves clearly indicated the main transition in the range of ca. -68 – -28 °C corresponding to the glass transition temperature of SS. From the maximum of the tan delta curves, the main (alpha) temperature (Tα) of SS was determined to be of -34 °C for polyether-based (TPTbP and TVbP) and − 28 °C for polyester-based (TPobP and TPribP) bio-PUs, while the Tα values of the reference samples based on HDI were slightly lower, -68 °C and − 44 °C for HPTP and HPoP, respectively.\n\nThe PU materials based on the bio-based isocyanate Tolonate X FLO 100 were generally more flexible than the materials based on HDI, because in the SS transition region their storage modulus drops sharply by 3 orders of magnitude (from GPa units to MPa units). The subsequent slower decrease of the storage modulus at temperatures above about 0 °C may be related to the melting of crystalline domains, or to Tg of HS. In contrast, the HDI-based PUs were much stiffer materials, as the storage modulus in the transition region of SS only decreased by one order of magnitude. Then there was a gradual decrease of the storage module up to a temperature of about 25 °C, which may be related to the melting of the crystalline phase (see the DSC results above). However, the HDI-derived samples are overall more segregated into SS and HS domains than the bio-based PUs, which was manifested by a significant sharp drop in the storage modulus at temperatures of approx. 120 °C (HPoP) and 130 °C (HPTP), related to the melting of crystalline domains in HS.",

Of this data, less than 2% correspond to bio-based plastics. Currently, polymers, including elastomers, are non-recyclable and come from non-renewable sources. Additionally, most elastomers are thermosets, making them complex to recycle and reuse. It takes hundreds to thousands of years to decompose or biodegrade, contributing to plastic waste accumulation, nano and microplastic formation, and environmental pollution. Due to this, the synthesis of elastomers from natural and renewable resources has attracted the attention of researchers and industries. In this review paper, new methods and strategies are proposed for the preparation of bio-based elastomers. The main goals are the advances and improvements in the synthesis, properties, and applications of bio-based elastomers from natural and industrial rubbers, polyurethanes, polyesters, and polyethers, and an approach to their circular economy and sustainability. Olefin metathesis is proposed as a novel and sustainable method for the synthesis of bio-based elastomers, which allows for the depolymerization or degradation of rubbers with the use of essential oils, terpenes, fatty acids, and fatty alcohols from natural resources such as chain transfer agents (CTA) or donors of the terminal groups in the main chain, which allow for control of the molecular weights and functional groups, obtaining new compounds, oligomers, and bio-based elastomers with an added value for the application of new polymers and materials. This tendency contributes to the development of bio-based elastomers that can reduce carbon emissions, avoid cross-contamination from fossil fuels, and obtain a greener material with biodegradable and/or compostable behavior.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nAccording to PlasticsEurope AISBL©, the global plastics production data in 2021 was 390.7 Mt, and in 2022, it was 400.3 Mt; where Africa produced 9%, Europe 14%, America 21%, and Asia 56%, with China being the country with the highest plastic production, with about 32%. These include conventional plastics and thermoplastics such as PET, PE, PP, PVC, PS, and PU, as well as some thermoset plastics [1,2]. The production and consumption of conventional plastics and polymers show an increase year after year.\n\nElastomers, a category of polymers characterized by high elasticity and viscoelasticity, possess the ability to revert to their initial form after undergoing stretching or deformation and are known for their outstanding resistance to abrasion, tearing, and impact. Elastomers find applicability across various industries, including automotive, aerospace, construction, electronics, healthcare, and biomedicine [3,4,5]. There are two types of elastomers: thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) (e.g., thermoplastic polyester elastomers, thermoplastic polyether elastomers, thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer, thermoplastic polyamide elastomers) and thermosets (e.g., vulcanized natural or industrial rubber, epoxidized natural rubber, cross-linked polyester elastomers, cross-linked polyurethane elastomers). Thermoset elastomers predominate in production and consumption. The elastomer industry encompasses three primary kinds: rubber, plastic, and gel. Rubber elastomers, crafted from natural or synthetic polymers, are renowned for their remarkable elasticity and durability. In contrast, plastic elastomers or TPE represent a fusion of rubber and plastic, delivering a harmonious combination of flexibility and rigidity [3,4]. Currently, polymers, including elastomers, are non-recyclable and come from non-renewable sources [5]. Due to this, the synthesis of elastomers from natural and renewable resources has attracted the attention of researchers and industries.\n\nBy the definition provided by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the term “bio-based” refers to “materials that are either entirely or partially composed of biological products originating from biomass. This encompasses materials derived from plant, animal, marine, or forestry sources” [6]. In environmental terms, bio-based polymers possess the capacity to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2). This reduction occurs because, during the synthesis process using natural resources as raw materials, plants absorb atmospheric CO2 for their growth. As a result, bio-based polymers contribute to a net reduction in atmospheric CO2 levels [7].\n\nA bio-based polymer originates from natural and/or renewable sources, typically derived from biomass, and is recognized for its environmentally friendly characteristics. It exhibits a shorter environmental decomposition time, influenced by both abiotic and biotic factors [8]. This polymer or elastomer may consist partially or entirely of bio-based components, such as a mixture, composite, copolymer, graft, additive, or by employing natural monomers in the synthesis (biopolymer). A higher percentage of bio-based content indicates a more sustainable material, often associated with biodegradable and compostable behavior [9].\n\nIn this review paper, new methods and strategies are proposed for the preparation of bio-based elastomers. The main goals are the advances and improvements in the synthesis, properties, and applications of bio-based elastomers from natural and industrial rubbers, polyurethanes, polyesters, and polyethers, and an approach to their circular economy and sustainability.\n\n2. Bio-Based Elastomers from Natural and Industrial Rubbers\n\nSynthetic elastomers used in tires are derived mainly from petrochemicals, which are not sustainable. Recently, renewable resources have been used to produce several bio-based elastomers. For example, itaconic acid is a renewable resource from fermentations produced by microorganisms, especially Aspergillus terreus; it is used as a bio-based building block. Lei et al. have manufactured silica/poly(di-n-butyl itaconate-co-butadiene) (20–80% butadiene) nanocomposite-based green tires that are prepared by redox-initiated copolymerization of di-n-butyl itaconate and butadiene. These bio-based elastomers have excellent wet skid and low roll resistances, respectively [10].\n\nIt is essential to say that not all bio-based polymers are biodegradable (capability of being degraded by biological activity); for example, bio-based plastics such as the bio-polyethylene (Bio-PE) and Bio-poly(ethylene terephthalate) (Bio-PET) that use bioethanol from sugarcane (by the fermentation of glucose) [8,11,12], starch-based crops produced by wet-mill processing as raw material [13,14], the chemical modification of natural rubbers (NR) that have been modified to improve their properties and application, as well as the epoxidized NR under strain-induced crystallization (SIC) [15], are all non-biodegradable polymers.\n\nIn particular, natural rubber (NR) is a polymer composed of isoprene units linked to form double bonds with a cis configuration (99.9%, cis-1,4-polyisoprene) when extracted from the latex of the Hevea brasiliensis trees and Parthenium argentatum woody shrub [16,17,18]; trans configuration extracted from the latex of the Palaquium gutta trees (trans-1,4-polyisoprene) [17,19]; and cis/trans isomer mixtures extracted from the latex of the Manilkara zapota trees [17,18,20]. NR (99.9%, cis-1,4-polyisoprene) is widely employed in the fabrication of tires, construction industries, and biomedical applications. NR possesses unique properties due to its low modulus and high elasticity and can rapidly recover its original state upon release of external stress [18].\n\nBased on reprocessability, bio-based NR can introduce bio-based chemically crosslinked thermoplastics. The bio-based chemically crosslinked/cross-linkable elastomers (CCEs) from NR and synthetic elastomers derived from bio-based monomers have been reported. CCEs possess better resilience and higher operating temperatures due to covalent three-dimensional (3D) networks [4,21,22,23,24]. Several dicarboxylic acids are used as green crosslinkers to react with ENR (Figure 1).\n\nSrirachya et al. investigated a crosslinking agent for ENR. They demonstrated that it was possible to crosslink ENR with maleic anhydride thermally; no additional catalysts were needed [21]. Riyajan et al. studied the influence on the physical properties, including the swelling behavior, tensile strength, and thermal stability of the vulcanization of ENR latex using a terephthalic acid crosslinker. It was observed that the ENR crosslinked with terephthalic acid depolymerized in natural soil compared to natural rubber vulcanized with sulfur [22]. Pire et al. crosslinked the epoxidized NR by dodecanedioic acid with 1,2-dimethylimidazole. The authors explain that 1,2-Dimethylimidazole accelerates crosslinking, and imidazolium dicarboxylate species are formed to reach the less substituted side of the epoxy site [23,24]. Generally, the ENR crosslinked with dicarboxylic acids improves mechanical properties compared to those vulcanized by sulfur because carbon–oxygen crosslinks possess higher bond energies than sulfur ones [25].\n\nBio-Based Elastomers with Essential Oils\n\nCitric fruits (Rutaceae family) are the most commonly cultivated and consumed fruits worldwide. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), global overall citrus fruit production in 2020 was around 158.49 million metric tons [26]. The major citrus-producing countries include China, Brazil, and the United States of America. Approximately 40–60% of the fruit is discarded as waste upon consumption. In general, the industrial production of citrus fruits generates 110–120 million tons of citrus waste yearly, such as peels (flavedo and albedo), seeds, and pomace [27,28,29]. It is possible to extract limonoids, essential oils, phenols, flavonoids, carotenoids, and cellulose from these wastes. Significantly, essential oils can be obtained from the peels and seeds of citrus fruit waste, and they are considered potent bio-resource materials for various uses in the food and non-food sectors. Also, these substances are considered plant-based natural products consisting of volatile and aromatic compounds present at low concentrations. Essential oils are compounds made up of isoprene units attached to 10-carbon and 15-carbon structures known as monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids, respectively. These compounds are typically found in the oil sacs of citrus peels and cuticles, as shown in Figure 2 [29].\n\nEssential oils or citrus oils have the characteristics of being low in toxicity, inexpensive, and can be obtained by several extraction techniques such as steam distillation and solvent extraction [30,31]. They are mainly used in the pharmaceutical industry to obtain active ingredients, the cosmetics industry in perfume production, food for flavoring preparation, and the chemical industry in packaging materials production, among others. In the bio-based elastomers elaboration, essential oils have significantly modified natural rubber and some industrial elastomers.\n\nTerpenes have emerged as viable candidates to serve as monomers in bio-based elastomer production. The most common type of bio-based elastomers from terpene is β-Myrcene, which is extracted by hops, bay, and thyme oils or can be obtained by pyrolysis from β-pinene [32]. β-Myrcene has two conjugated double bonds in its structure and can be polymerized similarly to its isoprene via anionic, free-radical, coordination, and cationic reactions. These polymerization reactions can have several possibilities for 1,2-; 3,4-; and 1,4-cis or trans myrcene isomerization to obtain elastomers with similar mechanical and thermal properties to NR (Hevea brasiliensis, Palaquium gutta, and Manilkara zapota trees). In 1960, Marvel studied the polymerization of myrcene by Ziegler-type catalysts (triisobutylaluminum, TiCl4, and vanadium trichloride) with a predominantly 1,4 arrangement of the diene unit in the polymer chain, with conversions of 80% of the polymyrcene [33].\n\nIt has been reported the stereoselective polymerization of β-myrcene and β-ocimene and their copolymerization with styrene using homogeneous titanium catalysts activated by MAO (methylaluminoxane) showing different stereoselectivity, for example, 1,4-trans-poly myrcene (92%) and its copolymerization with styrene using dichloro{1,4-dithiabutanediyl-2,2′-bis(4,6-di-tert-butyl-phenyl)}titanium complex, and 1,4-cis-poly myrcene (92%) in the presence of Ti(η5-C5H5)-(η2-2,2′-methylene bis(6-tert-butyl-4-methylphenoxo))Cl complexes were obtained. Also, these catalysts were used in the β-ocimene polymerization. Other terpenes are ocimene (which can be produced from the thermal cracking of β-pinene) and farnesene (which can be found in nature like α- and β-isomers); however, farnesene can be obtained through the fermentation of sugar feedstocks [34]. When using the last catalysts with ocimene and a high temperature (70 °C), the 1,4-trans polymer (70%) is formed, while at a lower temperature, an isotactic poly-1,2-ocimene (>99%) was obtained [35].\n\nOn the other hand, Lamparelli et al. have reported that the soluble heterocomplexes consisting of sodium hydride in combination with trialkylaluminium derivatives have been used as anionic initiating in the polymerization of myrcene and its copolymerization with styrene and isoprene [36,37].\n\nIt is well known that NR and industrial elastomers such as polybutadiene (PB) and poly(styrene-butadiene-styrene) (SBS) are materials used in the production of tires, adhesives, and rubber bands, among others. The properties of elastomers are amorphous polymers found above their glass transition (Tg), which explains their deformability. Authors have demonstrated that modified elastomers such as NR are proposed to expand the application [38]. It has been reported that d-limonene, β-pinene terpenes, some menthol, β-citronellol, and citral terpenoids, mainly extracted from turpentine, lemon, mandarin, orange, mint, citronella oils, citral, and other terpenes, contain in their structure carbon–carbon double bonds, and they are used in the natural rubber modification via metathesis reactions [39,40,41,42].\n\nSome reports have shown that d-limonene, considered the most abundant component in mandarin (74%), lemon (87%), and orange (97%) essential oils, is used as a chain transfer agent (CTA) in the cross-metathesis reaction of NR in the presence of ruthenium carbene-alkylidene and vinylidene complex catalysts (Figure 3). These two classes of catalysts tolerate a wide range of functional groups (e.g., amino, carboxyl, acetoxy, ester, hydroxy, fluorine, and chlorine), and they are active with more sterically hindered substrates such as natural rubber [43,44,45].\n\nNR modification with limonene and mandarin oils via cross-metathesis allows the synthesis of mono-terminated or terpene-terminated oligomers (Table 1) with low molecular weight around Mn × 102 g × mol−1 and yields of 80% when the catalyst Grubbs-2 is used (entries 1 and 3). In contrast, with Grubbs-1 and vinylidene-II and -III catalysts [40], the molecular weights of terpene-terminated oligomers are around Mn × 104 g × mol−1 with yields ranging from 70–96% (entries 2, 7, and 8).\n\nIt essential to note that Ru-vinylidene catalysts (I) showed higher catalytic efficiency in the cross-metathesis reaction of NR with d-limonene and mandarin oil to give terpene-terminated oligomers with Mn × 103 g × mol−1 (entry 6) [41] Also, authors reported that cross-metathesis reaction can control the molecular weight by the NR/CTA molar ratio (entries 3–5). A similar approach, bio-based NR, was obtained using lemon, orange, and β-pinene terpene as CTAs [39,40,41,46]. This easily accessible class of Ru complexes showed high thermal stability combined with good activity in the NR cross-metathesis.\n\nTheoretical studies have shown that trisubstituted internal olefin (NR, d-limonene) is more difficult to break the C=C bond than one disubstituted unsaturation of the cis-polybutadiene and other polyalkenamers due to the steric hindrance of the methyl group of the NR, which makes difficult the coordination between the M=C complex and C=C double bond of isoprene [47]. For example, this has been confirmed by experimental studies in the cross-metathesis of SBS synthetic elastomer using d-limonene and orange oil as CTA. The SBS-terpene elastomer modification in the presence of ruthenium–vinylidene catalysts (I) and Grubbs-1 to several molar ratios [rubber]/[CTA] was accomplished.\n\n3. Bio-Based Polyurethane Elastomers\n\nThe global production of polyurethane (PU) remains between 5.3 and 5.5% compared to conventional plastics such as PET, PE, PP, PVC, and PS [1,2,8]. PU has gained much attention due to its excellent thermal, mechanical, and chemical properties, diversity in material types, and their applications. There are different types of polyurethanes, including thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPUs), thermostable polyurethanes, and elastomeric polyurethanes (EPUs). The most common thermostable polyurethanes are foams, widely used as thermal insulators; among the most common EPUs are those used as adhesives, high-performance sealants, shoe soles, paints, textile fibers, gaskets, and in the construction, furniture, medical, and automotive industries. The characteristic properties of elastomeric PU include high resistance to wear and abrasion, good cushioning capacity, good flexibility at low temperatures, high resistance to fats, oils, oxygen, and ozone, excellent elastic recovery, transparency, and adhesion [48,49,50,51].\n\nPU is synthesized by a polycondensation reaction between a diisocyanate and polyol or macrodiol with an average molecular weight in the range from 600 to 4000 g/mol, using a short-chain diol or chain extender with molecular weights in the range of 62 to 400 g/mol to increase the chain’s molecular weight and define the material’s rigidity. The polyol forms the soft and flexible segments and provides an elastomeric matrix responsible for most of the elastic properties of EPU. The diisocyanate, polyol, and diol are used at different molar ratios, and the reaction mixture will define the soft and hard segments, the type of PU, its properties, and its applications [49,52,53,54].\n\nThese three components or raw materials for the production of PU are derived from oil resources. Currently, PU is a non-recyclable polymer that comes from non-renewable sources. It can also be a thermoplastic PU, which makes it a complex material to recycle and reuse; moreover, there is no adequate waste management. It takes hundreds to thousands of years to decompose or biodegrade, contributing to plastic waste accumulation, nano and microplastic formation, and environmental pollution [55,56]. Due to this, the synthesis of PU from natural and renewable resources has attracted the attention of researchers and industries to form different types of bio-based PU [51,57,58,59]. Precisely for this study, bio-based EPU shares elastic properties like rubbers and thermoplastic polyurethane; these properties are provided mainly by the polyol from natural resources, making it ideal for different applications.\n\nDifferent diols and polyols have been used to synthesize bio-based EPUs derived from algae, plants, animals, crustaceans, grains, cereals, and fruits. Some diols and polyols are mannitol, sorbitol, xylitol, glycerol, cardol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,4-butanediol, and 1,6-hexanediol bio-based (Figure 4). Many polyols have been obtained and modified from lignin, chitin, chitosan, and cellulose (aromatic polyol) [60,61,62,63,64,65,66]. Some diols can be converted into polyols by a polycondensation reaction; for example, polyhexanediol (bio-based polyol) has been obtained from 1,6-hexanediol [62].\n\nVarious polyols have been synthesized from industrial and natural rubbers, which have elastomeric properties because they come from rubbers, such as excellent elastic recovery, low transition temperature (Tg), and flexibility at low temperatures, which will be transmitted to the polyurethane. Polyols from polybutadiene (PB), polybutadiene rubber (BR), or SBS copolymer have been synthesized. BR has repeating butadiene units, which can be trans or cis-1,4-polybutadiene and are modified with another compound or reagent with hydroxyl (-OH)-terminated groups, which are called “hydroxy-terminated polybutadiene” (HTPB), hydroxy telechelic polybutadiene or polyols; these have been obtained by different methods such as oxidation or oxidolysis [67,68], anionic polymerization [69], via copolymerization [70], via nickel catalyst [71], and by olefin metathesis [72,73]. Other polyols have been obtained from natural rubber (NR), NR comes from the rubber tree, or from its synthetic form, polyisoprene rubber (IR), which has repeating isoprene units and can be trans or cis-1,4-polyisoprene [18]. In the same way, NR is modified with another compound with -OH groups, which are called “hydroxy-terminated polyisoprene” (HTPI or HTNR) or polyols; these have been obtained by different methods such as epoxidation [74,75], anionic polymerization [76], and by olefin metathesis [42].\n\nOf the mentioned methods, obtaining polyols by olefin metathesis reaction has shown that both natural and industrial rubbers can be modified or degraded under mild conditions, at low temperatures and atmospheric pressure, in solvent-free conditions, or allowing the use of green solvents, and using fatty alcohol, terpenes, diols, or essential oils with OH groups from natural resources such as chain transfer agent CTA for the synthesis and production of bio-based elastomeric polyurethanes (Figure 5). This is a new and promising synthesis route to produce bio-based polyols for applications in engineering polymers and elastomeric materials.\n\n4. Bio-Based and Biodegradable Polyester and Polyether Elastomers\n\nSince the last decade, developing new elastomers has brought infinite possibilities using natural materials for their synthesis. This new trend has arisen due to the high demand for elastomers from the market derived from non-renewable sources, which produces a constant negative effect [4]. These effects cause a series of environmental concerns. Throughout the entire technological production process and obtaining raw materials derived from oil, endless red dots cause extensive damage to ecosystems [77,78]. This environmental issue and the long degradation time have many unprecedented negative ecological consequences.\n\nBased on those statements, the advantages of looking for new sources and routes to obtain elastomers continue to increase. Indeed, polyester and polyether arise as new sources of elastomers with many properties, starting from elasticity, which is the ability to recover the shape after a deformation [4,5]. However, to achieve this elasticity, the elastomers must have an elastomer and an elastic region over a considerable strain (Figure 6). When the elastomer has a rigid and flexible region, it is called a copolymer, and some particularities are involved in this type of material. Despite the viscoelasticity and weak inter-molecular forces, elastomers generally have low Young’s modulus but high failure strain. These peculiarities became elastomers as a tremendous and essential material for numerous applications such as aerospace, construction, automobile, and, more recently, biomedical industries [4,79,80].\n\nBased on the type of crosslinking, elastomers can be divided into main groups: the chemically crosslinked and the physically crosslinked. The last one has a more thermoplastic function, and it is named physically crosslinked thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs). It is well known that chemically crosslinked elastomers possess excellent resilience and higher operating temperatures since the covalent functionality allows the creation of 3D networks in the material. This type of elastomer is commonly known as “rubbers” and their applications will be limited depending on the additives used to obtain a particular elastomer for further engineering applications [81,82].\n\nSince natural and synthetic rubbers have a global consumption of more than 14 Mt in 2022 [73], the TPEs became more important since they possess a microphase-separated structure, avowing the use of reinforced fillers. This particularity is essential in terms of the recyclability of the material. Still, commercial synthetic elastomers are produced or obtained from fossil resources, translating into more environmental problems than natural rubbers or other elastomers. Indeed, researchers’ primary objective is to develop bio-based elastomers to reduce carbon emissions, avoid cross-contamination from fossil fuels, and obtain a greener material with biodegradable and/or compostable behavior.\n\n4.1. Generalities from Polyester and Polyether Elastomers\n\nBased on the chain chemistry of the elastomer, these materials can be divided into polyester elastomers and polyether elastomers, depending on the segment of the general formula. However, segmented copoly (ether-ester) elastomers are also included in the group of ester elastomers. Several authors reported a synthesis course in which phase separation occurs when the substituted (normally polyols) molecular weight is high enough. Then, a soft phase with a noticeable low glass transition temperature and a hard phase with a high melting point are designed [4,79]. Until now, segment modifications have started to include bio-based materials, but usually, the elements joining polyether and polyester segments could be ester, amide [83], urethane [84], and ether groups [85].\n\nIn general, these elastomers can be easily synthesized through an esterification and polycondensation process. Meanwhile, changing the ratios and varying the compounds used as hard and soft segments can improve their physical properties. These characteristics bring a thermodynamic immiscibility material in which the rigid phase is separated from the flexible segments (phase separation), and two phases are found in the material, a softer one with different glass transition and melting temperature than the rigid phase [77]. In terms of composition, the hard segments are generally aromatic polyesters, while the soft segments are aliphatic polyethers or polyesters with long chains. Some examples are found in the literature for hard segments, which include poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT), poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT), and Polyether ether ketone (PEEK) [86]. In the case of soft segments, polyol molecules such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), poly(tetramethylene glycol) (PTMG), and poly(sebacate ethylene glycol) are a few of those used in the formulation [87]. The most common strategy for synthesized and fabricated polyester and polyether elastomers is the introduction of long aliphatic flexible soft segments into the most rigid phase material. This process gives the polyester–polyether elastomers a range of unique properties, such as similar synthetic features as polyesters, but biodegradation is still missing.\n\nFor this reason, efforts to find alternatives to more environmentally friendly materials have been studied. Indeed, other polyols, such as natural and vegetal oils, glycerol and its derivatives, terpenes, and resins, synthesize copolymers to obtain excellent polyesters and polyether elastomers. The idea of producing these plastics is to proceed with linear degradation, which means that only at the surface of the material exposed to water are mass loss and dimensional reduction proportional to the surface area exposed.\n\nThis process can be enhanced if a polyester or polyether is included in the elastomer structure, increasing the mechanical properties but enhancing its performance in terms of thermal stability, chemical resistance, and structural integrity. To understand this enhanced mechanism deeply, Table 2 shows some examples of bio-based and biodegradable polyester and polyether elastomers found in the literature and their respective characteristics.\n\n4.2. Bio-Based and Biodegradable Polyester/Polyether\n\nTo understand the biggest challenges for formulating bio-based and/or biodegradable polyester/polyether elastomers, some researchers plan experimental strategies in Table 2.\n\nRemarkably, the strategies can be divided into groups depending on the bio-based or/and biodegradable source in which the monomer for polymerization is presented. Depending on the applications, different additives or rigid polymers are included to enhance their properties. Indeed, Groeneveld [88] used the exceptional characteristics of the Castor plant to extract ethoxylated oils, promising sources of mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, and penta-esters using glycerol derivates. The authors founded a technique based on two-dimensional liquid chromatography hyphenated with high-resolution mass spectrometry to obtain polyether(ethers) with polyols, which can be used as initiators for the synthesis of polyurethanes. Since the techniques are valuable for the comprehensive separation of overly complex, the uses for this type of components are variable, from coatings, adhesives, sealants, and synthetic lubricants to functional fluids in which isomers are pretty necessary.\n\nAnother example using plant-derived materials is the one presented by Martínez et al. [89], in which the use of polyterpene natural rubber from Hevea brasiliensis was implemented in a cross-metathesis reaction with α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds.\n\nAuthors claim that preparing unsaturated polyester elastomers has excellent potential as a petrochemical alternative, including in perfume, flavor, and pharmaceutical industries. These results were conclusive when novel aliphatic unsaturated esters with molecular weight values around Mw = 1912 to 3367 g/mol and yields ranging from 68 to 79% were obtained. This result is encouraging since terpenes from plant-derived can be used satisfactorily in this type of chemical reaction.\n\nSimilar to the previous results, residues from plant-based biomass rich in hemicellulose can be used to form α,ω-unsaturated polyesters and polyether. To get this, Piccini et al. [90] use a bicyclic diol 1,2-O-isopropylidene-α-D-xylofuranose D-xylose derived from the biomass and a mixture with ω-unsaturated fatty acids and alcohols, originating a promising bioplastic for sustainable packaging applications. The authors employed an acyclic diene metathesis polymerization and found a decrease in the glass transition temperatures when increasing the chain length of the additives. Moreover, after being cast into films, the elastomers displayed remarkable polyethylene-like properties with high Young modulus and elongation at break, solid yet flexible behavior, and excellent gas barrier properties, proving their uses as food packaging materials.\n\nIndeed, the uses of plant-derived materials are getting increasingly valuable, and Linh et al. [91] presented the synthesis, preparation, and properties of some polyethers from chalcones. Chalcones (or 1,3-diphenyl prop-2-en-1-one) are promising molecules with α,β-unsaturated carbonyl groups [96]. Linh et al. [91] mainly use the 4-hydroxy benzaldehyde and vanillin with p-hydroxy acetophenone to synthesize diphenol chalcone-derived monomers. The Claisen–Schmidt condensation reactions with 1,6-dibromo hexane were performed for the elastomer formulation, and a co-polyether’s materials were achieved. Even when several applications in pharmaceutical compositions, microscopy, photosensitive materials, nonlinear optical materials, and crystal display liquids are found, the authors believe that further studies in the field of photochemistry and photosensitivity need to be performed. This hypothesis was based on the TGA analyses that proved that polymer samples had good thermal stability.\n\nAnother biomass for the obtention of copolyether polyols is presented by Basterretxea et al. [77] when lignocellulosic and limonene terpenes are applied into self-condensation and polycondensation. The authors claim the preparation of ideal candidates in a great variety of polyurethane elastomers is due to the comprehensive properties and tunable crystallinity found in the materials. Since lignocellulosic materials and hemicelluloses are presented in many plant-derived materials, their uses are common in the obtention of polyester and polyether elastomers. Sousa et al. [87] use some natural sources such as ethylene glycol and 2,5-furan-dicarboxylic acid to produce the poly(ethylene 2,5-furan-dicarboxylate) and poly(ethylene glycol) elastomers by polytransesterification reaction. These furandicarboxylated copolyester/ethers are essential insights for the packaging industry since lower melting temperature and higher thermal stability were found in other investigations by Qu et al. [94] for the preparation of bio-Furan-based polyesters in food and beverage packaging, clothing, and in the car industry. One type of biomass source with lignocellulosic components in corn, and Luo et al. [93] presented the synthesis and evaluation of polyether diols-based polyurethane dispersions by a solvent-free process using poly propanediol and poly(tetramethylene ether) glycol as copolymer. The solvent-free method was enough to obtain a polyether diol-based polyurethane that can be included in textile coatings since it presents high adhesion ability and excellent softness.\n\nFinally, it is essential to consider that other renewable resources such as polylactic acid (PLA) [92] and citric acid [97] are still undergoing investigation to be considered excellent components to produce polyester and polyether elastomers. Indeed, Nagarajan et al. [92] evaluated the production of a thermoplastic copolyester elastomer using PLA and Hytrel, a commercial thermoplastic polyester elastomer, to produce a more environmentally friendly material based on the substitution of the bio-based Hytrel into several compositions with the PLA being the optimal the formulation with 70/30. Hytrel is a polyether glycol and polybutylene terephthalate elastomer, but when glycidyl methacrylate, maleic anhydride, and a melting processed reaction using ethylene butyl acrylate and ethylene methyl acrylate copolymers, some properties such as a co-continuous morphology and changes in tensile strength and modulus of the binary blends decreased depending on the content of Hytrel. However, impact toughness and a more significant stress whitening zone were observed in the impact-fractured composite surface with ethylene methylene acrylate-glycidyl methacrylate, showing better results. This result is interesting when reducing bio-based materials from non-renewable sources is included in producing sustainable copolymers for commodity and engineering applications.\n\nSimilarly, Acosta et al. [95] studied substituting or reducing a commercial greenpoxy 28 material obtained from plant and vegetable origin into a reinforced composite. The authors explain that it is possible to treat the composite to reduce its amount in the preparation of elastomers. For this, the woven jute fabric is used as reinforcement material and allyl-functionalized ditertiary amine as a curing agent and a multifunctional thiol (3-mercaptopropyl (trimethoxysilane)) as a radical photoinitiator. The authors prepared the blends using epoxy/thiol-ene photopolymerization to obtain a polyether-polythioether crosslinked co-network. The results indicate an increase of up to 50% in flexural modulus and strength concerning the non-functionalized counterparts. Also, the composites displayed higher deformation at break and toughness due to the presence of polythioether in the co-network. The prepared biocomposites could be excellent material applications in aerospace, nautical, automotive, packaging, and building industries.\n\n4.3. Advances in the Use of Bio-Based and Biodegradable Polyester and Polyether Elastomers\n\nAlthough the advances in the search for bio-based or biodegradable elastomers continue to increase, the expectations for using materials from polyester and polyether elastomers continue to be infinite. Various authors describe that polyester or polyether elastomers are excellent candidates in terms of durability, degradability, costs, and synthesis; however, many studies only focus on the chemical formulation and its characterization, and few studies explain and demonstrate with a straightforward application, concise and precise, the improvements and virtues of the new composites created. Thus, a series of articles were selected because their applicability in biomedical, sensors, reconstruction, advanced materials, and drug delivery (Figure 7) are clearly explained, and they constitute an excellent example to continue with the development of said materials.\n\nIn the biomedical area, Lin et al. [84] prepared polyethylene glycolated (PEG) poly(glycerol sebacate) scaffolds employing solvent-free urethane crosslinking and spontaneous pore-forming procedure at room temperature (Figure 7a). The authors include a hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) crosslinker to evaluate the controllable crosslinking degrees and hierarchical macro-/micro-porosities. Also, a bilayer with an osteoinductive mesoporous bioactive glass (MBG) could enhance the reconstruction in vivo assessments. Authors found that the experiment, conducted for at least 12 h, reveals a low crosslinking degree which stimulates chondrogenic differentiation, maintains chondrocyte phenotype, and enhances cartilage matrix secretion compared to elastic polymer with a high crosslinking degree, emphasizing the importance of matrix viscoelasticity in cartilage regeneration. This proposal for osteochondral regeneration is an excellent candidate and was expected for clinical translation to exhibit extraordinary regenerative efficiency after 12 weeks in the subchondral bone. Moreover, Wang et al. [97] presented degradable citric acid-based conductive polyester elastomers in terms of platforms for sensing. The platform created after the polycondensation process with citric acid, 1,8-octane diol, and poly(ethylene glycol) as monomers were coated with a silver nanowire layer and soft electronic material for flexible electronic devices was created. The mechanical stimuli evaluation of the poly(1,8-octane diol citrate acid) (POC) copolymer with PEG exhibits recoverable deformation after bending, converting strain to detectable resistance. For the sensing evaluation in humans, various human emotions were successfully evaluated with a wireless sensor. The results demonstrated that degradable citric acid-based polyester elastomers are promising for next-generation sustainable and flexible electronic devices.\n\nIn the same field of biomedicine, Sandmeier et al. [98] presented a biodegradable elastomer obtained by ring-opening polymerization of phenyl bis (2,4,6-trimethyl-benzoyl)phosphine oxide (BAPO) with 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA) or 2,3-hydroxypropyl acrylate (DIOL). The well-defined photoinitiator-polymer conjugates BAPO-HEA and BAPO-DIOL were digitally light-processed to obtain a 3D printing material without organic solvents. The result indicates that photopolymerization provides new opportunities for fabricating tissue scaffolds and medical devices with high-quality 3D printing in biodegradable shape-memory devices. Also, the final material exhibits this shape-memory behavior after the temperature is applied. The initial object was deformed at ~80 °C and fixed in that shape by cooling to −20 °C. This work offers new perspectives for the solvent-free additive manufacturing of bioresorbable medical implants and other functional devices. In the same order, Zhang et al. [99] presented an advanced material based on the design and manufacturing of cost-effective tannin-based polyether polyol (MTEBP) that was synthesized using tannin extract (MTE) as an efficient and reusable absorbent for oil and solvents. After copolymerization, the authors evaluated the adsorption capacities of the materials to soybean oil, xylene, dichloromethane, n-hexane, and cyclohexane, increasing their values by 53.5%, 57.9%, 115.1%, 83.5%, and 97.2%, respectively. Also, mechanical and thermal properties were enhanced after formulation. This work affords a feasible and sustainable strategy to fabricate bio-based, eco-friendly, tannin-based materials with high adsorption capacities for oil spill clean-ups.\n\nFinally, a very new technique to implement biodegradable elastomers into a drug delivery system is presented by Freire et al. [100] (Figure 7e). This study aimed to develop bio-based poly (thioether-ester) nanoparticles containing full-spectrum cannabis extracts and assay their potential efficacy in vitro BF16F10 melanoma cells. Tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol, and other natural compounds produced by Cannabis sativa exhibit a wide array of therapeutic effects on the human body but limited bioavailability due to their low solubility in water and moderate stability. The result indicates that poly (thioether-ester) nanoparticles were effective, and nanocarriers and potential anticancer activity could be demonstrated.\n\n5. Elastomers: The Circular Economy and Sustainability\n\nThe current development of our society is only possible by considering the role of polymers or plastics [101]. The generation and disposal of synthetic plastics are among the major current concerns in the sustainability discourse of large industries. The current issues with elastomers in terms of sustainability are multifaceted and include resource dependency, energy-intensive production, end-of-life management, microplastic pollution, toxic additives, and a lack of circular economy practices [102,103].\n\nIn recent decades, efforts have been made to develop various types of biodegradable plastics, aiming to constitute a class of “green polymers” following the principles of green chemistry. However, the degradation of plastics in landfills does not lead to the recovery of material value, and their degradation in oceans could create new or unwanted environmental impacts [104]. Strategies have been implemented to promote reuse and recycling techniques, extending the lifespan of materials and promoting their integration into a circular economic model [105,106]. As such, a wide breadth of literature has touched upon circular principles in the context of elastomers. Different R-strategies have been proposed or analyzed, and themes related to sustainability have also been integrated into part of the studies. This section explains the concepts of a circular economy and sustainability and describes which circular strategies have been mentioned in the previous elastomer literature.\n\n5.1. The Circular Economy\n\nCircular economic processes are not new and have been used for thousands of years. However, the foundations of the concept in the literature are reasonably recent. According to Mohajan, the term “circular economy” gained prominence in the late 20th century as a response to environmental and resource challenges [107]. Stahel and Reday first describe a loop economy framework that describes waste reduction and resource efficiency strategies and emphasizes the need to design products for longevity and efficient resource use [108]. Pearce and Turner explore the relationships between natural resources in the economy and the linearity of traditional economic systems [109]. One of the most commonly used definitions, a product of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation [110], defines a circular economy as “an industrial economy that is restorative or regenerative by intention and design”. Since the 2010s, many definitions have been proposed [111], with most focusing on reducing, reusing, and recycling resources, known as the first of the “R-strategies”. Geissdoerfer et al. define the circular economy as “a regenerative system in which resource input and waste, emission, and energy leakage are minimized by slowing, closing, and narrowing material and energy loops. These terms can be achieved through long-lasting design, maintenance, repair, reuse, remanufacturing, refurbishing, and recycling”. As such, the circular economy promotes resource efficiency and seeks to decouple economic growth from resource depletion and waste generation. This approach has gained significance in the 21st century as societies and businesses increasingly recognize the need for more sustainable and responsible economic models in the face of environmental challenges and resource constraints [112].\n\n5.2. Adding Sustainability to the Mix: Eco-Concept\n\nWhile sustainability is a term commonly used in the scientific literature, government documents, and the media, its definition is often ambiguous [113,114]. This lesser inclusion is partial because sustainability is a concept that has evolved dramatically since the beginning of the second half of the 20th century. The term was mainly used in the 1960s and 1970s to refer to environmental issues [115]. As one of the first contributions to early sustainability discussions about the trade-offs between economic development, social equity, and environmental conservation, “Limits to Growth”, published in 1972 [116], explores the implications of exponential economic and population growth and resource depletion. In 1987, the Brundtland Report, a result of the World Commission on Environment and Development, led by Gro Harlem Brundtland, famously defines sustainability as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” [117]. More recently, Geissdoerfer et al., after reviewing several definitions for the term, define sustainability as “the balanced and systemic integration of intra and intergenerational economic, social, and environmental performance”. Definitions that highlight the three pillars of sustainability, also known as the triple bottom line, are some of which are the most used today [112]. Even though circular economic applications can be solutions to achieving sustainability, both concepts are only sometimes aligned in the literature. Few circular economic definitions are linked to sustainable development, and economic prosperity is usually presented as the concept’s primary goal [111]. Circular economic processes are applied for economic and sometimes environmental considerations, but rarely social ones [118]. This means that sustainability trade-offs are not considered more often than otherwise. The existing literature [111,112,118] underlines the importance of accounting for sustainability when evaluating circular economy applications.\n\n5.3. Elastomers and Circularity\n\nMany studies focus on designing plastics that are more circular by nature. In their study, Hong and Chen [104] analyze the significant advancements in recyclable “green polymers” or chemically recyclable polymers, focusing on the technical and environmental benefits obtained in developing reuse and depolymerization processes for the chemical recycling of polymers at the end of their lifespan. Zanchin and Leone [119] review recent developments in thermoplastic polyolefin elastomers (P-TPE), highlighting their mechanical flexibility, lightweight, easy processability, and recyclability compared to thermosetting rubbers. P-TPEs meet the requirements for a sustainable circular economy for the next generation of plastics, showing promise as smart materials with shape memory and self-healing properties, particularly in innovative food packaging and coatings.\n\nUtrera-Barrios et al., in four separate papers, introduce elastomer redesign with the analysis of self-healing properties. The first paper [101] reveals the challenges that rubbers face in reprocessing, suggesting self-healing to automatically repair or restore damages, thereby increasing their lifespan and aligning them with the circular economy model. Self-repairing rubbers exhibit high healing efficiency and exceptional mechanical behavior, essential properties sought in sustainable materials. A second paper [120] develops new biodegradable elastomer compounds capable of self-repair using a blend of epoxidized natural rubber and polycaprolactone reinforced with alginates (salt group). This combination gives the material thermal self-healing capabilities, catastrophic damage restoration, and the ability to recover its mechanical properties, contributing to the circularity of elastomeric materials. A third paper [105] delves into crucial self-healing concepts in the automotive industry’s most widely used elastomeric matrices. They analyze the state of the art considering the nature of the elastomeric matrix (natural or synthetic), different curing mechanisms (extrinsic, intrinsic, and combinations), the chemistry underlying them, and mechanical performance. This review highlights the transformative impact of these concepts in revolutionizing the industry and paving the way towards a more sustainable future. Finally, a fourth [121] addresses promising biodegradable plant-based fillers, their biosynthesis, chemical properties, applications, reinforcing effects, and improvements in the performance of composite materials based on natural and synthetic rubber matrices in elastomeric compounds. Sustainable fillers such as quercetin, chitosan, lignin, and cellulose are considered.\n\nOther authors focus more on recyclability. Kumawat et al. seek to understand the relationship between the retention of physical properties and the load of granulated rubber and particle size. They characterize four different sizes of rubber particles physicochemically, concluding that finer particle sizes result in better dispersion of granulated rubber particles, providing superior mechanical, extrusion, and wear properties. This suggests that reducing particle size can increase the volume of recycled product utilization [106]. Georgescu et al. use recycled rubber in a range of 10–50% by weight as a filler material, eco-friendly reinforcement material, active loads, plasticizers, vulcanizing agents, and antioxidants to obtain chloroprene rubber. Recycled rubber reduces the compound’s ecological footprint by reducing its mass and revealing properties of elasticity, hardness, and abrasion resistance, making it a viable option regarding raw material life cycle, sustainability, eco-efficiency, and economic efficiency [122]. Kouhi et al. propose a simple method to reuse recycled rubber (RR) in closed-cell elastomeric foams based on ethylene propylene diene rubber (EPDM). Results in rheometry, morphology, and mechanical behaviors indicate that using RR could be a viable alternative for manufacturing high-performance EPDM foams with improved hardness and resilience, serving as an ecological substitute for virgin products [123].\n\nSamir et al. explore the production of biodegradable polymers through chemical treatment, microorganisms, and enzymes, focusing on their environmental impact and ease of disposal. They investigate using natural fibers such as kenaf fiber, hemp fiber, and abaca fiber as reinforcement materials in biocomposites, highlighting their properties and potential applications to enhance the bond between the polymeric matrix and natural fibers in composites [103]. They emphasize the potential of biodegradable polymers to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly in the medical industry and in reducing the carbon footprint of plastic production. The proportion of ground tire rubber (GTR) in thermoplastic elastomers has also been analyzed as a circular economy strategy and sustainable development in the recycling of waste tire rubber. The results obtained differed from what was expected, as mechanical properties and processability decreased with increasing GTR content. The results improved by adding PE-g-MAH to the composition, particularly in tensile strength and elongation at break [124]. Gregory and Williams investigate the recyclability of thermoplastic elastomers (TPE) that do not degrade during recycling. They use regularly placed sodium/lithium carboxylate side chains instead of hydrocarbons. This block polyester shows significantly higher tensile strengths than its non-functionalized counterparts, with high elasticity and elastic recovery, providing beneficial properties for thermal reprocessing [125].\n\nIn an innovative contribution to the literature, Al Rashid and Koç address how additive manufacturing (AM) processes can synergistically impact and bring new life to discarded polymeric parts through distributed recycling and manufacturing. They reuse polymeric waste and turn it into valuable resources, generating low costs for specific AM and 3D printing applications for use in the aerospace, automotive, biomedical, sports, food, electronics, and construction sectors [126].\n\nIn their paper, Cherubini et al. aim to improve the process of obtaining elastomeric compounds by introducing used cooking oils, replacing typical mineral processing oils (lubricants). Cooking oils showed similar rheological behavior to traditional oils used in rubber production, resulting in the same processability of the resulting compound, as well as fracture and traction properties. These are promising results for applying circular economy principles by substituting mineral oils in manufacturing processing [127].\n\nIn their review, Doyle et al. analyze the critical considerations in designing circular products and the ecological engineering of polymeric foams. This includes the characterization of materials across a broader spectrum of molten polymer gas solutions, aging behavior, polymer chain adaptation, compression, and detailed modeling of the effects of cutting on cell nucleation, as well as the improvement of processing tools to achieve high results and defined pressure drop rates [128].\n\n5.4. R-Strategies in the Lifecycle of Elastomers\n\nR-strategies, or closed loops that indicate a material flow in a product’s lifecycle to an earlier node of the lifecycle, are generally understood to be circular economic processes [129]. Earlier frameworks for waste management outline the 3R framework, which stands for “Reduce, Reuse, Recycle”. Now, as many as 60 R-strategies can be found in the literature [130], and many effectively refer to similar processes. Cramer’s 10R framework (Refuse, Reduce, Renew, Reuse, Repair, Refurbish, Remanufacture, Repurpose, Recycle, Recover) [131], which is very close to Rieke’s et al. R-strategies [129], is differentiated enough to provide a more precise analysis than the 3R framework. We use this framework to evaluate the applicability of circular economy processes to the lifecycle of elastomer production. Table 3 defines each R-strategy and enumerates the elastomer-related literature in which applications related to these strategies are proposed. The literature cited here is incomplete but offers a general idea of which R-strategies are most commonly mentioned in the literature that ties elastomers to circular applications.\n\nCircular elastomer production applications are focused on only a few of Cramer’s ten R-strategies [131]. Reduce and renew strategies are commonly cited in the literature. This is mainly because elastomers are often unusable after a certain period. Reusing, refurbishing, remanufacturing, or repurposing are rarely appropriate avenues. Redesigning the elastomers to limit the number of raw materials used or lengthen the product’s lifespan is more appropriate. Organizations employ research and development methods in light of these strategies. On the other hand, strategies that improve the recyclability of elastomers are also very commonly cited in the literature. Creating an elastomer that conserves value and can be easily recycled at the end of its lifespan is another objective that relies on research and development. What can be retained from the literature on circular strategies for elastomers is that the brunt of the effort in making an elastomer more circular is directed towards initiative-taking measures rather than reactive ones. While this is more interesting in terms of cost and energy saving eventually, it also requires firms to invest in research to make their products more circular early in the design process.\n\n6. Conclusions and Perspectives\n\nIn this review the essential oils, d-limonene, β-pinene, terpenes, some menthol, β-citronellol, and terpenoids have the characteristics of being low in toxicity, inexpensive, and can be obtained by several extraction techniques; NR, PB and SBS modification with these compounds via cross-metathesis allows the synthesis of terpene-terminated oligomers and bio-based elastomers. They can be used in pharmaceutical, cosmetics, packaging, and chemical industries.\n\nOf the mentioned methods, the synthesis of polyols by olefin metathesis reaction (depolymerization or degradation) has shown that both natural and industrial rubbers can be modified and degraded under mild conditions using natural resources with -OH groups and obtain bio-based diols and polyols (not derived from oil), which can be used for the synthesis of polymeric materials with elastomeric properties and the polyurethane industry.\n\nThe polyesters, polyethers, and their copolymers (segmented poly-ether-ester) arise as new sources with elastomer properties; these can be synthesized from bio-based resources such as castor oil, natural rubber, polylactic acid (PLA), lignocellulosic, limonene terpenes, fatty acids, vanillin, tetrahydrocannabinol, among others. These materials have the advantage of being biodegradable since the ester group is reported to be susceptible to microbial attacks. They have numerous applications, such as aerospace, construction, automobile, and, more recently, biomedical industries.\n\nThe current issues with elastomers in terms of sustainability are multifaceted and include resource dependency, energy-intensive production, end-of-life management, microplastic pollution, toxic additives, and a lack of circular economy practices. Circular elastomer production applications are focused on only a few of Cramer’s ten R-strategies. This is mainly because elastomers are often unusable after a certain period. Reusing, refurbishing, remanufacturing, or repurposing are rarely appropriate avenues. Creating an elastomer that conserves value and can be easily recycled at the end of its lifespan is another objective that relies on research and development; it also requires firms to invest in research to make their products more circular early in the design process.\n\nPerspectives:\n\nWe need standard norms that demand the use of bio-based elastomeric materials or the incorporation of recycled elastomer to produce new materials.\n\nStudies and techniques are needed to evaluate the formation and pollution of nano and microplastics released from elastomeric materials.\n\nFurther research is required to explore R-strategies pathways, their classification, and the potential application of bio-based elastomers, such as “reuse–reduce–recycle”, to promote sustainable elastomer materials practices.\n\nFinally, for many elastomeric materials, sustainability in terms of environmental decomposition needs to be studied or reported; therefore, degradation and biodegradation studies are required. In addition to the fact that if a bio-based elastomer, this does not make it biodegradable or compostable, requiring studies for its classification.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceptualization, M.B., A.M., J.D.H.-V., T.S., M.R.-M. and C.D.T.-Q.; methodology, M.B., A.M., J.D.H.-V., T.S., M.R.-M. and C.D.T.-Q.; validation, M.B., A.Y.Y., G.L.-B. and C.D.T.-Q.; investigation, M.B., A.M., J.D.H.-V., T.S., M.R.-M. and C.D.T.-Q.; resources, M.B., A.Y.Y., G.L.-B. and C.D.T.-Q.; writing—original draft preparation, M.B., A.M., J.D.H.-V., T.S., M.R.-M. and C.D.T.-Q.; writing—review and editing, M.B., A.Y.Y., G.L.-B. and C.D.T.-Q.; funding acquisition, M.B., A.Y.Y., G.L.-B. and C.D.T.-Q.

In addressing this challenge, nano-based antibacterial agents offer a promising avenue of research. In the present study, we used an extract of Moringa oleifera, a widely recognized edible and medicinal plant, to synthesize biogenetic tellurium nanoparticles (Bio-TeNPs). Transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and dynamic light scattering analyses revealed that the obtained Bio-TeNPs had diameters between 20 and 50 nm, and zeta potential values of 23.7 ± 3.3 mV. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the Bio-TeNPs consisted primarily of Te(0), along with some organic constituents. Remarkably, these Bio-TeNPs exhibited potent antibacterial activity against a spectrum of pathogens, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhimurium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus agalactiae. In addition, findings from growth curve experiments, live/dead cell staining, and scanning electron microscopy observations of cell morphology demonstrated that Bio-TeNPs at a concentration of 0.07 mg/mL effectively disrupted E. coli and K. pneumoniae cells, leading to cell rupture or shrinkage. The biofilm inhibition rates of 0.7 mg/mL Bio-TeNPs against E. coli and K. pneumoniae reached 92% and 90%, respectively. In addition, 7 mg/mL Bio-TeNPs effectively eradicated E. coli from the surfaces of glass slides, with a 100% clearance rate. These outcomes underscore the exceptional antibacterial efficacy of Bio-TeNPs and highlight their potential as promising nanomaterials for combating bacterial infections.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nBacterial infections currently stand as the second-leading cause of death worldwide, significantly impacting both human health and economic development [1]. Unfortunately, the irrational use of antibiotics and the natural selection of bacteria have exacerbated the problem of drug-resistant strains [2]. Consequently, there is an urgent need to explore novel therapeutic avenues to combat bacterial infections. Fortunately, nanotechnology has been rapidly advancing in the realm of biomedicine, offering a promising approach to address both bacterial infections and drug resistance [3]. Bionanomaterials, which are distinguished by their enhanced bioactivity and biocompatibility, compared with their physically and chemically synthesized counterparts, stand out as particularly promising candidates in this regard. Various antibacterial nanomaterials, including AgNPs [4], AuNPs [5], CuONPs [6], and ZnONPs [7], have demonstrated high levels of efficacy in combating bacterial infections. Compared with conventional methods which are reliant on hazardous chemicals and involve the production of toxic by-products [8], biological synthesis methods offer a safer and more environmentally friendly alternative [9]. The production of bionanomaterials is characterized by mild conditions, safe processes, and overall eco-friendliness [10]. Bionanomaterials are also easy to synthesize [11]. In general, microorganisms and plant extracts are used to synthesize bionanomaterials [12]. Compared with microorganisms, edible and medicinal plants offer a richer and safer array of active metabolites. Previous research has indicated that natural active products in plant extracts could be more effectively combined with nanomaterials so that they gain additional biological functions [13].\n\nMoringa oleifera is an edible medicinal plant native to India [14]; its extracts contain various bioactive properties that are now being effectively exploited [15]. M. oleifera is currently used to produce functional nanomaterials, such as AgNPs [16,17], MgONPs [18,19], SeNPs [20], and ZnONPs [21], which exhibit antibacterial, antioxidant, and anticancer properties. Tellurium (Te) is a semimetallic element in the chalcogen family, and commonly exists in nature in oxidized states of −II, 0, +IV, and +VI, with Te(IV) and Te(VI) as its main forms [22]. Te compounds were first used as antimicrobial agents as early as 1932. These compounds exert their antimicrobial properties mainly in the form of tellurite ions [23]. Additionally, tellurium nanomaterials have also been used for applications in biomedicine on account of their antimicrobial, antioxidant, antifungal, and anticancer properties [24]. In recent years, biosynthesis of the nanoforms of Te has attracted the attention of many researchers. For instance, Pseudoalteromonas shioyasakiensis [25] and Mortierella sp. AB1 [26] were used to synthesize biogenetic Te nanoparticles (Bio-TeNPs), which inhibited various pathogenic bacteria. Similarly, Streptomyces cyaneus [27] and Gayadomonas sp. TNPM15 were used to produce Bio-TeNPs which repressed certain Aspergillus pathogens and phytopathogenic fungi [28]. Studies such as these have demonstrated the excellent antibacterial properties of Bio-TeNPs. In addition, extracts of aloe vera [29], pepper [30], and citrus fruit [31] have been used to synthesize antibacterial and anticancer Bio-TeNPs. However, the use of M. oleifera extract to synthesize Bio-TeNPs has not yet been reported.\n\nThe thin branches and discarded shredded leaves of M. oleifera have lower economic value, compared with the seeds and flowers. The use of such by-products for nanomaterial production could increase their value as plant material, while at the same time reducing the cost of synthesizing Bio-TeNPs. In the present study, the extract was taken from thin branches and discarded shredded leaves of M. oleifera; this was used as a stabilizing, capping, and reducing agent to synthesize Bio-TeNPs. These Bio-TeNPs were then characterized by visible light spectrum analysis, transmission electronic microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential analysis, energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In addition, the antibacterial activity of Bio-TeNPs was tested in a series of experiments and then evaluated.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\n2.1. Materials\n\nM. oleifera samples were obtained from Hubei Mingshan Jingnan Moringa Technology Co., Ltd. (Huangshi, China). Potassium tellurite (K2TeO3) was purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology (Shanghai, China) Co., Ltd. Chemical element tellurium [Chem-Te(0)] (CAS No. 13494-80-9) was obtained from Shanghai Yien Chemical Technology (Shanghai, China) Co., Ltd. The strains Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 700603, Shigella dysenteriae CMCC 51252, Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 14028, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619, Streptococcus agalactiae E442, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 were obtained from the Strain Preservation Center of Hubei Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Wuhan, China). Bacteria were cultured on MHA (Mueller–Hinton Agar) medium at 37 °C.\n\n2.2. Biosynthesis of Bio-TeNPs\n\nFresh specimens of discarded thin branches and leaves underwent a process of washing, drying, and storage at room temperature. A quantity of 100 g of these thin branches and leaves was then combined with 1000 mL of distilled water (ddH2O) and brought to a boil for 5–10 min. Next, the mixture was filtered, and the resulting liquid was stored at 4 °C for 24 h before use. Subsequently, a 50 mL portion of the extract was blended with 0.1 g of K2TeO3 in a 100 mL glass beaker at 28 °C for 4 h, using a magnetic stirrer. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min and washed three times with ddH2O. Subsequently, the washed tellurite nanoparticles were resuspended in 10 mL of ddH2O. The resulting material was dried, and the concentrations of Bio-TeNPs were then determined.\n\n2.3. Characterization of Bio-TeNPs\n\nTo gain insights into the morphology and composition of Bio-TeNPs, the Bio-TeNPs produced as described in Section 2.2 were subjected to further analysis using a previously established protocol [26]. The Bio-TeNPs solution underwent examination using a plate reader within a wavelength range of 300–800 nm (SpectraMax i3x, Molecular Devices, CA, USA). Subsequently, the Bio-TeNPs solution was sonicated, applied onto a copper mesh, dried, and processed for observation and EDS analysis under transmission electron microscopy (Tecnai G2 F30, FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA). Additionally, the Bio-TeNPs solution was sonicated, diluted, and introduced into an electrophoresis system with instrumental parameters set to 25 °C for 10 s to determine its zeta potential (Zetasizer Nano ZS90, Malvern, UK). Simultaneously, a portion of the same liquid was transferred to a cuvette, with instrument parameters set to 25 °C for 10 s at an angle of 173° to measure dynamic light scattering (Zetasizer Nano ZS90, Malvern, UK). Following these measurements, the Bio-TeNPs were subjected to drying using an SJIA-10N vacuum freeze dryer (Ningbo YinZhou Sjia Lab Equipment Co., Ltd., Yinzhou, China). The dried Bio-TeNPs were then affixed on a tray coated with gold and observed using a scanning electron microscope (SU8010, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Dried Bio-TeNPs were also tested using X-ray diffraction (Bruker D8 Advance, GER, Billerica, MA, USA) with a scan time of 10 min and a scan rate of 10°/min. Further analysis involved pressing the dried Bio-TeNPs, setting the spectral range to 400–4000 cm−1, and ensuring a resolution accuracy of 0.4 cm−1 using infrared spectroscopy (Nicolet IS10, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Dried Bio-TeNPs were also pressed and placed in an apparatus for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ESCALAB 250XI, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with a pass energy of 30 eV (0.10 eV) and 120 eV (1.00 eV) at a spot size of 500 µm. Under these conditions, upon excitation by X-rays, photoelectron data were collected to form an energy spectrum.\n\n2.4. Antibacterial Activity Tests\n\nTo assess antibacterial activity, inhibition zone tests were performed. First, the chosen bacteria were cultured on MHA medium overnight at 37 °C. Following incubation, bacterial colonies from the MHA plates were harvested, washed, and suspended in 0.85% (w/v) saline solution. These suspensions were then diluted to a turbidity of 0.5 McFarland standard (~1 × 108 cfu/mL) using a turbidity meter (Vitek 2 DensiCHEK) (bioMérieux, Lyon, France). The diluted bacterial suspensions were evenly spread onto MHA plates (50 µL bacterial suspension per plate). Subsequently, sterilized Oxford cups were placed on each plate, and varying concentrations of Bio-TeNPs (0.07, 0.7, and 7 mg/mL) were added to the cups (100 µL each). As a control, an extract of M. oleifera (7 mg/mL) and Chem-Te (0) (7 mg/mL) was utilized. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 15 h, allowing for the inhibition of bacterial growth. Following incubation, the diameters of the inhibition zones surrounding the Oxford cups were measured using vernier calipers; these diameters were recorded as indicators of antibacterial efficacy.\n\n2.5. Growth Curve Experiments\n\nTo further evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of Bio-TeNPs, a growth curve analysis was conducted. Bacteria, cultured overnight on MHA plates as outlined in Section 2.4, were harvested and suspended in MHB media. A fresh suspension of E. coli and K. pneumoniae with a turbidity of 0.6 McFarland units was prepared using a turbidity meter (Vitek 2 DensiCHEK). Next, 50 µL of the suspension was added to 5 mL of MHB medium. The growth of E. coli and K. pneumoniae in MHB media was then assessed in the presence of Bio-TeNPs, Chem-Te(0), and M. oleifera extract at concentrations of 0.07, 0.035, and 0.007 mg/mL. Bacteria cultured in an MHB medium without any samples served as the control group. Next, 200 µL samples were collected every 2 h, and their optical density was measured at 600 nm using a microplate reader (SpectraMax i3x, Molecular Devices, CA, USA).\n\n2.6. Live/Dead Cell Staining\n\nTo investigate the bactericidal effect of Bio-TeNPs on E. coli and K. pneumoniae, a live/dead cell staining experiment was conducted. Bacteria, cultured overnight on MHA plates as detailed in Section 2.4, were harvested and resuspended in MHB media to achieve a turbidity of 0.5 McFarland standard (~1 × 108 cfu/mL). These bacterial suspensions were then cultured with Bio-TeNPs at concentrations of either 0 or 0.07 mg/mL in a shaker at 150 rpm, incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Following incubation, the cells were collected and washed with 0.85% (w/v) saline solution. A LIVE/DEAD Bacterial Staining Kit (BBcellProbe® N01/PI, BestBio, Shanghai, China) was utilized to stain the live and dead cells according to the manufacturer’s instructions [32]. In brief, the bacteria were resuspended in PI and NO1 dye working solution, followed by incubation away from light for 15 min. Subsequently, the bacteria were washed and resuspended in 0.85% saline solution. Finally, a 5–10 μL quantity of bacterial suspension was taken and added to a slide for sample observation. The stained bacteria were excited at 488 nm, and live and dead cells were observed using laser scanning confocal microscopy (Nikon Eclipse Ti, Tokyo, Japan).\n\n2.7. Morphological Observation of Microorganisms\n\nBacteria (~1 × 108 cfu/mL) were cultured in the MHB media at 0.07 mg/mL of Bio-TeNPs, with ddH20, Chem-Te(0) and M. oleifera extract as control groups. The cultures were incubated at 150 rpm at 37 °C for 4 h. After incubation, 2 mL amounts of cultures were collected and processed according to previously described methods [20]. Briefly, the collected samples were fixed overnight at 4 °C in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, washed three times with 1.5 mL of physiological saline solution, and then dehydrated with a gradient of anhydrous ethanol (30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%). Next, the obtained samples were freeze-dried for 12–24 h. The bacteria were then immobilized on trays and treated with gold spray. The treated E. coli and K. pneumoniae were observed via SEM (S-4800, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan).\n\n2.8. Biofilm Formation Inhibition Assay\n\nCrystalline violet staining and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) staining were used to determine the effect of compounds on E. coli and K. pneumoniae biofilm formation and attachment. According to the method described in Section 2.4, fresh E. coli and K. pneumoniae suspensions of 0.6 M were prepared using a turbidity meter (Vitek 2 DensiCHEK). A 20 µL amount of bacterial solution and a 180 µL amount of MHB medium containing different concentrations of Bio-TeNPs (0.007, 0.035, 0.07, and 0.7 mg/mL), extract of M. oleifera (0.07 and 0.7 mg/mL), and Chem-Te (0) (0.007, 0.035, 0.07, and 0.7 mg/mL) were added to the 96-well plate, mixed uniformly and incubated statically at 37 °C for 24. The bacterial biofilm formation was then washed using PBS, fixed in methanol, and stained with crystal violet and solubilized 33% (v/v) acetic acid solution. In addition, a portion of cultured bacteria was collected and washed with PBS to remove planktonic bacteria. Subsequently, bacteria were stained with FITC for 30 min and washed with PBS to remove unbound dye. Finally, stained bacteria were observed under an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti 2, Tokyo, Japan).\n\n2.9. Clearance Rate of Bio-TeNPs against E. coli on the Surfaces of Glass Slides\n\nBacteria, cultured overnight on MHA plates as detailed in Section 2.4, were harvested and resuspended in MHB media. The E. coli suspension (30 µL, ~2 × 108 cfu/mL) was evenly spread onto a glass slide measuring 2 cm × 2 cm and allowed to air-dry for 15 min to fix the bacteria. Subsequently, the area covered with the bacterial specimen was treated with 100 µL of Bio-TeNPs (7 and 0.7 mg/mL), Chem-Te(0) (7 and 0.7 mg/mL), M. oleifera extract (7 mg/mL), and 0.85% (w/v) normal saline; this was dispensed using pipettes, the tips of which were used to achieve an even spread. After 20 min, cells were recovered from the glass slides by scraping with cotton swabs, which were then immersed in 1 mL of 0.85% (w/v) normal saline. Finally, 50 µL of the aforementioned treated normal saline stock solutions and dilutions (10−1, 10−2, and 10−3) were spread onto MHA plates. The number of colonies was enumerated to determine the bacterial survival rate.\n\n2.10. Cytotoxicity Evaluation of Bio-TeNPs\n\nIn order to evaluate the cytotoxicity of Bio-TeNPs, vero-E6 cells were used as a cell model, determined by the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) (APExBIO, Houston, TX, USA). First, Vero-E6 cells were inoculated in a 96-well culture plate (1.0 × 104 cells/100 μL per well) for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Then, Bio-TeNPs were added to 96-well plates with different final concentrations (7, 0.7, and 0.07 mg/mL). Chem-Te(0) (7 mg/mL) and Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (7 mg/mL) were used as control groups. After 24 h, the culture medium was removed and washed twice with PBS. Finally, to each well of the plate was added 100 μL fresh DMEM and 10 μL CCK-8; incubation then continued for 3 h at 37 °C. The absorbance at 450 nm was determined using a multi-plate reader (SpectraMax i3x, Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA).\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Characterization of Bio-TeNPs\n\nThe Bio-TeNPs were typically black in color (Figure 1A). The UV-visible spectrum of the Bio-TeNPs was analyzed using a microplate reader. A number of peaks noticeable at approximately 230 nm, 250 nm, 260 nm, and a slight peak at 350 nm were observed at 0.07 mg/mL of Bio-TeNPs (Figure 1B). At a concentration of 0.7 mg/mL of Bio-TeNPs, a distinct peak at 350 nm was observed (Figure 1C). To identify the morphology and size of the Bio-TeNPs in this study, TEM, SEM, DLS, EDS, and XRD were performed. The results indicated that the Bio-TeNPs had diameters of 20 to 50 nm and irregular spherical shapes (Figure 2A–D). Some of the Bio-TeNPs in the SEM were slightly larger, probably because some of the nanoparticles agglomerated together during the freeze-drying process. The zeta potential of the Bio-TeNPs was found to be 23.7 ± 3.3 mV. The EDX result indicated that the composition of Bio-TeNPs was rich in tellurium. In addition, the XRD spectrum showed Te crystal peaks at (100), (101), (102), and (110) (Figure S1), and these four peaks were similar to the findings of previous studies [33].\n\nBased on the FTIR results, peaks were observed in the M. oleifera extract at 570.98 (C–I stretch), 726.12 (C-Cl stretch), 1071.19 (indicative of cyclic ethers or large rings containing carbon), 1264.39 (suggestive of aromatic primary amine, CN stretch), 1404.89 and 1564.17 (representing carboxylate groups), 1581.72 (related to secondary amine, NH bend), 2851.15 (associated with saturated aliphatic groups, methylene), and 3153.17 (indicative of ammonium ions) cm−1 (Figure 3A). Bio-TeNPs exhibited peaks at 625.03 (associated with alkyne, C–H bend), 1075.17 (related to the primary amine, C–N stretch), 1198.56 (indicative of tertiary amine, C–N stretch), 1272.26 (suggestive of hydroxyl groups, primary or secondary), 1361.61 (representing aliphatic nitro compounds), 1440.89 (associated with methyl groups, C–H stretch), 1488.20 (indicative of aromatic nitro compounds), 1649.01 (related to olefinic groups), and 3385.78 (associated with hydroxyl groups) cm−1 (Figure 3B). All the interpretations were based on an analysis of infrared spectra previously published in the literature [34]. These findings suggested that the M. oleifera extract contained proteins, aromatic compounds, carboxylate groups, aliphatic acids, and inorganic ions, while the Bio-TeNPs contained proteins, aliphatic acids, and aromatic nitro compounds. Notably, the proteins, aliphatic acids, and aromatic compounds present in the Bio-TeNPs originated from the M. oleifera extract. The XPS results also showed that the Bio-TeNPs contained many C and O elements (Figure 3C); this meant that the main components of the Bio-TeNPs were organic in nature. Furthermore, the presence of Te3d, associated with Te(0), was confirmed through XPS analysis (Figure 3D), and no Te(IV) peak was observed. This result indicated that Te(IV) was reduced to Te(0) by the M. oleifera extract and that Te(0) was an important constituent of Bio-TeNPs.\n\n3.2. Antibacterial Activity of Bio-TeNPs\n\nA zone of inhibition test was conducted to determine the antibacterial activity of the Bio-TeNPs. The results indicated that M. oleifera extract displayed noticeable antibacterial activity against S. dysenteriae, with slight effectiveness against K. pneumoniae and E. coli (Table 1). Chem-Te(0) demonstrated antibacterial efficacy against S. dysenteriae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. typhimurium, S. pneumoniae, and S. agalactiae (Table 1). Bio-TeNPs exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against all tested pathogens except S. aureus (Table 1). Pictures of inhibition zones are shown in Figure S2. Though M. oleifera extract and Chem-Te(0) exhibited varied inhibitory effects against these bacteria, their levels of potency were generally lower than those of Bio-TeNPs at equivalent concentrations. This suggested that M. oleifera extract enhanced the antibacterial properties of Bio-TeNPs. Notably, M. oleifera extract by itself exhibited no antibacterial activity against S. typhimurium, S. pneumonia, and S. agalactiae, but it did enhance the antibacterial activity of Bio-TeNPs against these bacteria. Three explanations may be offered for these results, as follows: (1) It is possible that, during the synthesis of Bio-TeNPs, the active ingredients were enriched on the nanoparticles, resulting in higher concentrations on the Bio-TeNPs. M. oleifera extract has been reported to exhibit antibacterial ability against S. typhimurium [35]. However, no antibacterial effect against S. typhimurium was observed in our study. This might have been due to the active concentration of the extract. (2) The Bio-TeNPs were obtained using a typical production process involving biosynthesis methods and natural biological components [36]. These materials generally exhibit high biocompatibility which enhances the stability of the final product, increasing its persistence in biological systems, and improving its interaction with biological environments, thereby boosting its effectiveness. (3) The nanostructure of Bio-TeNPs might have facilitated easier penetration of bacteria, with its effectiveness being further enhanced by its multifaceted antibacterial mechanism [37].\n\n3.3. Bio-TeNPs Inhibit Bacterial Growth\n\nTo gain more insight into the antibacterial activity of Bio-TeNPs, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae were chosen for further evaluation via growth curve experiments. Bio-TeNPs at concentrations of 0.07, 0.035, and 0.007 mg/mL were selected for experimental purposes on account of their excellent antibacterial activity. The absorbance values of E. coli and K. pneumoniae increased with elapsed time in the control and M. oleifera extract group, while Bio-TeNPs and Chem-Te(0) showed different inhibitory effects on their growth (Figure 4). The results showed that Bio-TeNPs and Chem-Te(0) at 0.07 mg/mL were effective in rapidly preventing the proliferation of E. coli. At a concentration of 0.035 mg/mL, E. coli began to grow at 18 h with Chem-Te(0), whereas it remained entirely inhibited by Bio-TeNPs. When exposed to 0.007 mg/mL Chem-Te(0), E. coli growth was resumed at 16 h, while it was still predominantly inhibited at 0.07 mg/mL Bio-TeNPs (Figure 4A,C,E). Similarly, Bio-TeNPs (at 0.07 and 0.035 mg/mL) immediately inhibited the growth of K. pneumoniae, while Chem-Te(0) at the same concentration had a limited inhibitory effect on K. pneumoniae. Moreover, K. pneumoniae began to grow freely with Chem-Te(0) treatment at 4 h, while it was still inhibited by Bio-TeNPs at a concentration of 0.007 mg/mL (Figure 4B,D,F).\n\n3.4. LSCM Observation of Bacteria Treated with Bio-TeNPs\n\nThe antibacterial abilities of the Bio-TeNPs against E. coli and K. pneumoniae were further confirmed by microscopic observation. The percentage of dead cells was considerably higher, and that of live cells substantially lower, for E. coli and K. pneumoniae cells treated with 0.07 mg/mL of Bio-TeNPs, compared with corresponding values for untreated cells (Figure 5A,B). These findings indicated that the Bio-TeNPs exhibited excellent antibacterial ability.\n\n3.5. Morphological Changes after Treatment with Bio-TeNPs\n\nThe morphologies of E. coli and K. pneumoniae cells under ddH20, Chem-Te(0), and M. oleifera extract, and Bio-TeNPs treatments were observed via SEM. The results indicated that untreated E. coli and K. pneumoniae cells remained normal (Figure 6A,E). Cells treated with 0.07 mg/mL M. oleifera extract also showed no significant changes (Figure 6B,F). However, cells treated with 0.07 mg/mL Chem-Te(0) exhibited damage (Figure 6C,G), whereas the E. coli and K. pneumoniae cells treated with 0.07 mg/mL of Bio-TeNPs for 4 h were crumpled, broken, shrunken, and deformed (Figure 6D,H). The most significant cellular changes were observed after treatment with Bio-TeNPs. These results indicated that the E. coli and K. pneumoniae cells were destroyed by the Bio-TeNPs.\n\n3.6. Anti-Biofilm Activity of Bio-TeNPs\n\nBiofilm formation of E. coli and K. pneumoniae in 96-well plates was observed using the crystal violet staining method. The results revealed that M. oleifera extract exhibited significant anti-biofilm activity against K. pneumoniae, but no similar activity against E. coli was observed (Figure 7A,B). Both Chem-Te(0) and Bio-TeNPs demonstrated excellent antibacterial properties against E. coli and K. pneumoniae. With increased concentration, the inhibitory effect became more pronounced (Figure 7A,B), indicating the excellent anti-biofilm activity of Bio-TeNPs. At concentrations of 0.007 mg/mL and 0.035 mg/mL, Bio-TeNPs exhibited stronger anti-biofilm capabilities than Chem-Te(0). These results were further confirmed by the FITC staining observation. The complete E. coli and K. pneumoniae biofilms were observed at control, while biofilms were noticeably broken at 0.07 mg/mL Chem-Te(0) and Bio-TeNPs (Figure 7C).\n\n3.7. Application of Bio-TeNPs against E. coli on the Surfaces of Glass Slides\n\nE. coli often adsorbs to the surfaces of solid media in the environment, enabling it to survive, and resulting in contamination. In this study, E. coli was coated onto the surface of a glass slide to test the antibacterial application of Bio-TeNPs. The survival rates of E. coli cells treated with Bio-TeNPs and normal saline were calculated on the MHA plates (Figure 8A). It was found that the survival rates of E. coli after treatment with normal saline, 7 mg/mL M. oleifera extract, 0.7 and 7 mg/mL of Chem-Te(0), and 0.7 and 7 mg/mL of Bio-TeNPs were 100%, 97.2%, 63.9%, 0, 45.1%, and 0, respectively (Figure 8B). These findings indicated that 7 mg/mL Bio-TeNPs and Chem-Te(0) exhibited great potential for antibacterial application, while the cleaning ability of Bio-TeNPs was higher than that of Chem-Te(0) at a concentration of 0.7 mg/mL.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nIn the present study, the color, morphology, and size of Bio-TeNPs were observed through the visible absorbance spectrum, DLS, TEM, and SEM. Bio-TeNPs exhibited a number of absorption peaks at 230 nm, 250 nm, 260 nm, and 350 nm and their color was typically black. Consistent with results obtained in prior related studies, the synthesized Te nanoparticles were also black [38,39]. However, the absorption peaks of the Te nanoparticles were different. Our Bio-TeNPs have multiple absorption peaks at 200–300 nm, probably due to the complex composition of M. oleifera extract. The Bio-TeNPs produced by Shewanella baltica showed an absorption peak at 210 nm [40], whereas those synthesized using tea extracts showed an absorption peak at 270 nm [41]. This difference in spectra may be due to the different constituents of Bio-TeNPs. In addition, the concentration of Bio-TeNPs might also cause fluctuations in absorption peaks. Previous studies have shown that absorption bands may be related to the size of Te nanoparticles [42]. The DLS, TEM, and SEM results revealed that the synthesized Bio-TeNPs exhibited nearly spherical shapes with diameters of approximately 20–50 nm. These shapes and sizes are similar to those of the AgNPs, AuNPs, ZnONPs, and FeONPs synthesized by M. oleifera in a previous study [43]. Previous research has also shown that differences in plant/microbial species and synthesis conditions can cause changes in the shape and size of Bio-TeNPs [24,44].\n\nRegarding the constituents of Bio-TeNPs, FTIR analysis revealed that M. oleifera extract contained proteins, aromatic compounds, carboxylate groups, aliphatic acids, and inorganic ions, in line with previous reports [45]. Bio-TeNPs were found to contain proteins, aliphatic acids, and aromatic nitro compounds originating from M. oleifera extract. This finding is in line with the composition of AgNPs, AuNPs, ZnONPs, and FeONPs produced by M. oleifera [43]. However, there may be variations in the composition and content of these substances. Moreover, our XPS results indicated that Bio-TeNPs contained organic elements such as C, O, and Te(0). The presence of Te(0) suggests reduction by substances such as cysteine [16] in the M. oleifera extract from K2TeO3, while C and O were derived from organic compounds in the M. oleifera extract. Similarly, Te(0) has been identified as a primary constituent in Bio-TeNPs produced by microorganisms and other plants [26,31,46].\n\nThe antibacterial spectrum and efficacy of Bio-TeNPs recorded in the present work surpassed that reported in some previous studies. Regarding the antibacterial spectrum, Bio-TeNPs produced by Aspergillus welwitschiae have previously been shown to inhibit E. coli (with an inhibition zone of 29 mm at 25 mg/mL) but not Klebsiella [38]. However, in this study, Bio-TeNPs exhibited antibacterial activity against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. dysenteriae, S. typhimurium, S. pneumoniae, and S. agalactiae. Concerning antibacterial efficacy, Bio-TeNPs synthesized by Mortierella sp. AB1 was shown to inhibit E. coli (with an inhibition zone of 32.3 ± 0.9 mm at 10 mg/mL), S. dysenteriae (with an inhibition zone of 32.3 ± 1.2 mm at 10 mg/mL), and S. typhimurium (with an inhibition zone of 29.7 ± 1.5 mm at 10 mg/mL) [26]. Nonetheless, the antibacterial potency of Bio-TeNPs in this investigation surpassed that of both A. welwitschiae and Mortierella sp. AB1. This might be due to the antibacterial constituents of M. oleifera, which is an edible and medicinal plant [47]. The antibacterial activity of Bio-TeNPs recorded in the present study is comparable to that of AgNPs produced by Gracilaria crassa [48] and better than AgNPs produced by citrus sinensis peel extract [49]. Compared with M. oleifera-based nanomaterials, Bio-TeNPs in the present study showed antibacterial activity which was higher than that of AgNPs [50] and ZnONPs [51], but lower than that of iron oxide [52] nanoparticles. In the present study, Bio-TeNPs were also found to disrupt the integrity of E. coli and K. pneumoniae membranes and alter bacterial morphology. Interestingly, the positively charged Bio-TeNPs might be an important cause of the above phenomenon. Previous studies have indicated that one of the antibacterial mechanisms of biomaterials is the adsorption of positively charged nanoparticles onto negatively charged bacterial surfaces through electrostatic interaction, resulting in membrane damage and bacterial morphological changes [53]. Bar et al. also found that the interaction between different quantum dot materials and SLBs was driven by electrostatic attraction, and that defective SLBs would adsorb quantum dots more easily [54]. On the other hand, oxidative stress is also an important antibacterial mechanism, and positively charged selenium nanoparticles [55] and iron oxide nanoparticles [52] could kill bacteria through oxidative stress, contact with nanomaterials causing peroxidation of membrane phospholipids thus directly destroying the integrity of the cell membrane [53]. Moreover, Bio-TeNPs in this study showed noticeable anti-biofilm activity against E. coli and K. pneumoniae. This has rarely been reported for other Bio-TeNPs; indeed, at the time of writing, no Bio-TeNPs have been reported to exhibit anti-biofilm activity. However, extracts of pepper [30], aloe vera [29], and citric juice [31] have been reported to synthesize Bio-TeNPs against MDR E. coli and MRSA. Interestingly, the Bio-TeNPs in the present study exhibited no antibacterial activity against S. aureus; in addition, the antibacterial effect against Gram-negative bacteria was stronger than that against Gram-positive bacteria. This suggests that the antibacterial mechanism of biogenic tellurium nanoparticles may be somewhat unique, and different from that of Bio-TeNPs produced by other plants. Additionally, the toxicity of Bio-TeNPs was evaluated on Vero-E6 cells. No cytotoxicity was observed at concentrations of 0.7 and 0.07 mg/mL and there was a certain level of toxicity at a concentration of 7 mg/mL (Figure S3). In the present study, aqueous extract obtained from thin branches was used. The branches of M. oleifera are typically discarded after maturity, as they have lower economic value compared to the seeds and flowers. The use of such material may help save on the cost of synthesis in the future.\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nIn this study, M. oleifera extract was used to synthesize Bio-TeNPs. The produced Bio-TeNPs consisted of Te(0) and some organics from M. oleifera with the diameter ranging from 20 to 50 nm. The Bio-TeNPs showed excellent antibacterial activity against various pathogens based on the results of inhibition zone tests. Further, the inhibitory capacity of Bio-TeNPs against E. coli and K. pneumoniae was demonstrated by the growth curve experiments, live/dead cell staining, and cell morphology observation. The biofilm formation of E. coli and K. pneumoniae was also noticeably inhibited by Bio-TeNPs. Additionally, the Bio-TeNPs demonstrated significant antibacterial efficacy against E. coli on glass slides, highlighting their potential for antibacterial applications. Bio-TeNPs have been proven to be highly effective antibacterial materials, suitable for various medical and environmental sanitation applications based on the results in this study. However, the antibacterial mechanism of Bio-TeNPs remains unknown and requires further investigation. Additionally, the obtained Bio-TeNPs tend to aggregate easily. In the future, the addition of dispersants and stabilizers may be considered to enhance their stability and homogeneity.\n\n6.

      "# [China's Solution to Produce Green Aviation Fuel Through Carbon Dioxide by Zhonglin International Group](http://zhonglingj.com/index.php/en/industrytrends/843.html)\nFrom： Zhonglin International Group Date：03-22 857 Belong to：Industry Related\n\nWith the development of non aqueous renewable energy sources such as photovoltaics and wind energy, as well as electrochemical energy storage, the electrification of transportation vehicles has become the main technological route for reducing CO2 emissions in the transportation sector. However, in response to the rapidly developing aviation industry, the huge gap between the energy density of commercial lithium-ion batteries (0.54-1.26 MJ/kg) and aviation fuel (34.9-40.6 MJ/L) makes it difficult to achieve rapid electrification in the foreseeable future aviation industry, and there is an urgent need for a feasible technology to achieve the \"carbon neutrality\" goal of the aviation industry.\n\nGreen aviation fuel refers to C8-15 liquid hydrocarbon fuels derived from non fossil resources. According to the lifecycle analysis of Global Oil Company in the United States, the greenhouse gas emissions of green aviation fuel are reduced by 65% to 85% compared to petroleum based aviation fuel. During use, it exhibits a higher energy density, allowing the aircraft to fly further while consuming less fuel. All key indicators of aviation fuel, such as flash point, freezing point, stability, and combustion heat, meet or even exceed existing aviation fuel standards and specifications. When existing aircraft switch to bio aviation fuel, there is no need to change the aircraft engine and fuel infrastructure, and it can be used directly and conveniently. In this case, green aviation fuel is recognized as a feasible path to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the world aviation transportation industry.\n\nAs of the end of 2020, airlines in more than ten countries around the world have been testing biofuels, and a total of 65 countries have implemented mandatory blending instructions for green aviation fuel. The Renewable Energy Directive of the European Union (EU) requires that the proportion of green aviation fuel added should not be less than 5% by 2030 and 63% by 2050. In 2019, global aviation fuel consumption reached 360 million tons, indicating that the current global production and sales of green aviation fuel are only one thousandth of the total aviation fuel consumption, and there is huge potential for future growth.\n\nAt present, green aviation oil is mainly obtained from the cracking and refining of bio fats, with low yield and high energy consumption. Its selling price is as high as 2700-3100 US dollars/ton, which is four times that of petroleum based aviation coal. The high price limits its promotion and application, and how to selectively obtain green and low-cost aviation fuel has become an academic hotspot and industry pain point.\n\nLast year, the research team of the Department of Chemical Engineering at Tsinghua University successively published research results in ACS Catalysis and Nature Communications, marking significant progress in the field of CO2 to Aviation Fuel (CO2AFTM) production by the research team.\n\n01 Technical introduction\n\nThe research team at Tsinghua University has designed a process route targeting aromatic aviation coal fractions (C8-C15) as the target product, achieving a spontaneous reaction pathway for CO2 hydrogenation thermodynamically; Developing a self initiated monodisperse metal strategy on metal oxide molecular sieve acid-base heterojunctions, while maintaining over 80% of the directed conversion of aromatic hydrocarbons, increases the CO ₂ hydrogenation ability by three times. At the same time, the gas-solid structure characteristics inside the high-pressure hydrogenation multiphase flow reactor were explored to meet the strict requirements for temperature and concentration field uniformity in the CO ₂ hydrogenation process, laying a solid foundation for the conceptualization and industrialization of CO ₂ hydrogenation to produce green aviation fuels and chemicals.\n\nThe \"green\" of technology is reflected in the entire process. There are two raw material pathways: one is to use biomass as raw material, and synthesize bio aviation kerosene through one-step synthesis of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen obtained from biomass gasification; Another method is to use captured carbon dioxide as raw material and synthesize green aviation kerosene through carbon dioxide hydrogenation. The former fully utilizes renewable carbon resources in biomass by supplementing a certain amount of green hydrogen (or blue hydrogen) externally; The latter can flexibly plan the project scale based on the amount of green hydrogen resources obtained and the cost of green hydrogen.\n\n02 Technical advantages\n\nThere are two existing production paths for bio aviation kerosene:\n\nFirstly, the hydrogenation refining method that obtains bio aviation kerosene by hydrogenation refining vegetable oil, gutter oil, or other high oil substances. This type of aviation kerosene has a similar carbon number distribution to conventional petroleum based aviation kerosene. Representative technologies include the next-generation renewable jet fuel technology of NESTEOIL in Finland and the renewable aviation fuel process of Honeywell UOP in the United States. The advantages of the hydrogenation refining method are mainly reflected in its mature technology, flexible product adjustment (which can flexibly adjust the production of green aviation kerosene and green diesel according to market demand), and strong adaptability to the market. However, the limitation of raw material sources (various oils and fats, seaweed, and shepherd's purse) is the biggest problem of the hydrogenation refining method, especially the competition between vegetable oil raw materials and humans for food and land. The other main source, gutter oil, has been continuously rising in price due to its scattered distribution, poor procurement channels, and insufficient supply. Currently, it has reached 6000-7000 yuan/ton, which has increased the cost of the final product, bio aviation kerosene, and also affected the widespread promotion and application of this technology.\n\nSecondly, the Fischer Tropsch synthesis method that uses biomass such as cellulose and lignin as raw materials, first gasifies to generate syngas, which is then used to synthesize wax. The wax is then hydrocracked and hydroisomerized to produce bio aviation kerosene. Representative technologies include the first generation of bio aviation fuel and renewable diesel technology developed by Nesteoil in Finland, the iron-based catalytic high-temperature Fischer Tropsch synthesis process developed by Sasol in South Africa, and the inverse transformation+Fischer Tropsch synthesis process launched by Johnson Matthey in January 2022. The Fischer Tropsch synthesis method has a wide range of raw materials and significant carbon reduction effects, but the main components of the obtained liquid fuel are straight chain alkanes from C2 to C90. The C8 to C15 components that can truly be used as high-quality aviation kerosene only account for 25% of the synthesized product, and there are no cycloalkanes and aromatics, resulting in a low specific gravity and energy density of the obtained aviation kerosene, which means that the flight range of aircraft carrying the same volume of Fischer Tropsch synthesis fuel oil is short.\n\nCompared to the above technologies, the entire process path of CO2AFTM technology at Tsinghua University is green. Specifically, there are four advantages: firstly, the obtained aviation kerosene components are concentrated in C9 to C11 aromatics, and the selectivity of high-quality aviation kerosene components exceeds 80%. By blending with straight chain alkanes, qualified aviation kerosene products can be obtained. Secondly, the selection of aromatic rings as the final product improved the thermodynamic efficiency of the reaction process, resulting in high energy utilization efficiency and significant energy-saving effects. Thirdly, by using acid-base heterojunction catalysts, the reaction can be carried out under mild conditions of 270~370 ℃ and above 2MPa, with lower overall energy consumption and cost. The fourth is that the source of raw materials is extensive and sustainable - this technology can produce synthetic gas from renewable energy sources such as biomass, and then produce aviation kerosene in a one-step process. It can also capture and purify carbon dioxide emissions from industrial enterprises, and produce aviation kerosene in a one-step process with hydrogen gas, thereby achieving dual carbon reduction and resource utilization. It is a truly green, low-carbon, and even negative carbon aviation kerosene production process.\n\n03 Progress\n\nA 100 ton/year trial has been completed, verifying the selectivity, stability, effectiveness, and safety of the catalyst, demonstrating the scientific, rational, and feasible nature of the entire process flow. From the results of the small-scale trial, it can be seen that the carbon dioxide hydrogenation technology for one-step production of green aviation kerosene consumes approximately 3.3 tons of carbon dioxide, 0.43 tons of hydrogen, and 0.5kg of catalyst for every 1 ton of aviation kerosene produced. Moreover, the catalyst has not significantly deactivated after continuous use for 3000 hours.\n\nAt present, the 10000 ton industrial testing device constructed using this technology is under construction and is expected to be put into trial operation in 2023. This industrial experimental device will mainly solve some problems that cannot be detected in small-scale tests during the engineering process of catalysts and process, but may affect the long-term operation of future industrial demonstration devices. After the industrial experiment is completed, a process package of 100000 to million tons can be formed based on the scale of green hydrogen, and industrial promotion and application can begin steadily.\n\nThe total investment for constructing a 300000 ton/year device using this technology is approximately 4.5 billion yuan. If using photovoltaic technology to produce green hydrogen, a 4.5Gw photovoltaic system (calculated at 1600 hours/year for photovoltaic power generation) and 180 sets of 1000 cubic meters/hour electrolytic water hydrogen production equipment are required.\n\n04 Conclusion\n\nThis technology (CO2AFTM) uses CO2 and green hydrogen as raw materials and competes with world technology giants in the field (Green Jet FuelTM from Honeywell UOP in the United States and HyCOgenTM from Johnson Matthews in Europe). It proposes a Chinese solution in the world's low-carbon core technology field, which can fix carbon, create negative carbon emissions, help achieve net zero emissions in aviation flight, and convert wind and solar new energy electricity into liquid energy, contributing to China's carbon peak by 2030 The achievement of the carbon neutrality target by 2060 is of great significance.",
      "# [Cross-Linked Polyolefins: Opportunities for Fostering Circularity Throughout the Materials Lifecycle by Alison J Shapiro, Paul J Brigandi, Maria Moubarak, Saurav S Sengupta, Thomas H Epps](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11474822/)\nAbstract\n\nCross-linked polyolefins (XLPOs) constitute a significant portion of the plastics commercial market, with a market size of a similar order of magnitude to those of polystyrene and polyethylene terephthalate. However, few aspects of XLPO materials circularity have been examined relative to thermoplastic polyolefins. The cross-linking of polyolefins imparts superior performance properties, such as impact strength, chemical and electrical resistance, and thermal stability vs thermoplastic analogues, but it also makes the reprocessing of XLPOs to valuable products more challenging, as XLPOs cannot be molten. Thus, most XLPOs are incinerated or landfilled at the end of the first lifecycle, even though XLPO products are commonly collected as a relatively clean waste stream–providing a unique opportunity for valorization. In this review, we discuss approaches to improve XLPO circularity throughout the entire materials lifecycle by examining biobased feedstocks as alternative olefinic monomer sources and by assessing both traditional mechanical and advanced XLPO recycling methods based on industrial feasibility and potential product value. We also consider how advancing materials longevity can reduce environmental impacts and lifecycle costs and how recyclable-by-design strategies can enable better end-of-life opportunities for future generations of XLPO materials. Throughout this review, we highlight XLPO circularity routes that have the potential to balance the performance, circularity, and scalability necessary to impart economic and environmental viability at an industrial scale.\n\nKeywords: circularity, sustainability, lifecycle management, cross-linked polyolefin, cross-linked polyethylene, recycling\n\n1. Introduction\n\nAchieving polymer circularity is critical to address the adverse effects commonly associated with linear materials’ lifecycles, such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the manufacturing and accumulation of plastics waste. Polyolefins (POs), encompassing polymers such as polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP), constitute a substantial share of the global plastics market. Over 180 million metric tons of POs are produced from virgin feedstocks, and greater than 150 million metric tons of POs are discarded globally each year, which results in vast quantities of plastics waste.1 PE alone, the highest volume PO, accounted for over 65% of major resin (i.e., unprocessed plastic) manufactured globally in 2022, with a market of 124 million metric tons and >4% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) since 2018.2 Cross-linked PE (XLPE or PEX) – the largest volume cross-linked PO (XLPO) – comprises ∼5–10% of the total PE market with an expected 6–8% CAGR,1 which makes XLPO one of the most abundant commercial polymers–with a market size of a similar order of magnitude to those of polystyrene and polyethylene terephthalate.3\n\nXLPOs have superior performance properties relative to thermoplastic POs (e.g., better impact strength, chemical and electrical resistance, thermal stability) that are critical to their use in applications such as pipelines, storage tanks, foams, and cable insulations.4,5 For instance, XLPO is commonly leveraged in plumbing and radiant heating systems because it can maintain its structural integrity at higher temperatures than thermoplastic POs.6 XLPO is also often employed in cables to insulate the metal conductor(s) (e.g., copper) because of XLPO’s electric, heat, and moisture resistance.7 XLPOs can be derived from various types of POs, including PP, low-density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) for distinct characteristics tailored to specific use cases.4 For example, LDPE- or LLDPE-based XLPE is preferred in applications requiring flexibility, such as wire and cable insulation, whereas HDPE-based XLPE is favored in applications requiring substantial rigidity, such as pipes.4 It is worth noting that even though the majority of commercial XLPOs are XLPE, cross-linked PP, blends, and copolymers are likely to grow in interest as there can be performance and sustainability advantages to incorporating these other macromolecules (e.g., PP has increased thermal, ultraviolet (UV), and chemical resistance and higher rigidity than PE).8−11 XLPOs are usually highly cross-linked materials; for example, ASTM standards for XLPE tubing require a 65 to 89% degree of cross-linking.12 To achieve such cross-linking in POs, there are three primary strategies–peroxide, radiation, and silane cross-linking (Figure 1). Peroxide and radiation (with electron beam radiation being the most prominent) methods generate free radicals that result in the formation of cross-links between PO chains.13−15 Silane cross-linking (also known as moisture cross-linking) operates by the radical grafting of alkoxysilane cross-linkers to the PO backbone, followed by a condensation reaction to cross-link the polymer chains.14,16 Peroxide cross-linking is versatile and suitable for various applications because it offers a broad processing window and fast cross-linking of different form factors,4 but this option requires precise temperature control during extrusion and has significant equipment costs.15,16 In contrast, radiation cross-linking provides consistent results, but the technique is expensive and more suitable for thin-walled specialty cable applications due to the penetration limitations of radiation.14,15 For PP cross-linking, with either peroxides or radiation, cross-linking coagents are employed to reduce chain scission.9 Silane cross-linking is cost-effective, requires minimal additional equipment, and is popular in low voltage cables and pipes;15,16 however, the approach relies on moisture diffusion, which leads to longer cure times (particularly in dry environments), sensitivity to moisture content during curing, and susceptibility to premature cross-linking.14,16 On an industrial scale, XLPOs are generally extruded and/or injection molded then cured with specific processing conditions that depend on the application.14 For a more in-depth discussion of XLPO cross-linking techniques and manufacturing, a review by Ahmad and Rodrigue provides further insights.15\n\nThe starting PO material, cross-linking method, cross-linking degree, and other factors affect the material properties of XLPO. For example, peroxide-cured LDPE with a gel content of 83% and molecular weight between cross-links of ∼20 000 g/mol had a melting temperature (Tm) of 110 °C, tensile strength of 18.8 MPa, and elongation-at-break of 550%.17 In another example, silane-cross-linked HDPE with 70% gel content had a Tm of 133 °C, tensile modulus of 1023 MPa, tensile strength of 21.4 MPa, elongation-at-break of 389%, and crystalline fraction of 60%.18 Furthermore, application-specific standards dictate the minimum material requirements for XLPOs. For example, IEC 60502–1 is used for XLPE cable insulation and requires a minimum tensile strength of 12.5 MPa and elongation-at-break of 200% with a 25% maximum variation after heat aging.19 The specific application also imposes the standards used to assess properties such as the degree of cross-linking. For example, the wire and cable industry relies on hot set testing to assess cross-linking, in which a maximum permissible hot set elongation is 175%, as is delineated in IEC 60811–507.20 Alternatively, the pipes industry has specific cross-linking degree requirements that depend on the cross-linking mechanism (minimum gel content is 70% by peroxides, 65% by radiation, and 65% by silane cross-linking), as is delineated in ASTM F876–23 for pressure tubing.12 Such regulatory standards ensure consistent performance of XLPOs across applications.\n\nThe high performance of XLPOs comes at the expense of circularity. XLPOs cannot be molten, and hence, most commercial XLPOs follow a linear lifecycle and are landfilled/incinerated after the first use. This end-of-life outcome is environmentally unsustainable, contributes to pollution and resource depletion, and poses economic concerns. Although efforts have been made to collect XLPO waste at the end of its lifecycle, challenges persist in handling and efficiently recycling XLPO, which emphasizes the urgent need for scalable XLPO circularity processes.21 For instance, MTB Recycling (one of the largest cable recyclers in Europe) has an annual recycling capacity of 40,000 t of cables; however, the recovery and sale of copper and other metals is their major focus, and finding profitable solutions for the plastic cable components remains a challenge.21 As XLPO products are already collected and separated, such scenarios provide a unique opportunity for valorization. Previous reviews have focused specifically on XLPE recycling but have not covered the broader sustainability of XLPOs throughout the entire materials lifecycle.15,16,22 Broader PO circularity reviews tend to focus almost exclusively on thermoplastic POs with few including XLPO recycling.23−25 Thus, there is an opportunity to holistically examine the circularity and sustainability challenges, innovations, and opportunities for XLPOs from feedstock to end-of-life.\n\nThis review discusses sustainable solutions to improve the circularity of XLPOs throughout the entire materials lifecycle with a focus on strategies that have the potential to be economically and environmentally viable at an industrial scale. An overview of the materials circularity approaches considered in this review is shown in Figure 2. Strategies explored include employing biobased feedstocks to generate olefinic monomers, and examples in which such feedstocks are already in use commercially are highlighted. Existing methods that extend the first XLPO lifecycle are emphasized to maximize the material’s time in the “circularity loop” and reduce the amount of virgin feedstock consumed. Mechanical recycling processes and applications for ground XLPO as a filler/aggregate are discussed, and advanced recycling strategies that de-cross-link/deconstruct XLPOs are assessed on the basis of product value, scalability, and circularity. Additionally, XLPOs that are recyclable-by-design via dynamic covalent chemistries also are addressed, and key factors for evaluating these redesigned materials as alternatives to conventional XLPOs are proposed. The review concludes with considerations of future challenges and opportunities for sustainable XLPOs to balance high-performance demands with scalability and circularity.\n\n2. Biobased Olefinic Monomer Feedstocks\n\nThe majority of all commercial POs are synthesized from petroleum-derived monomeric feedstocks, which raises concerns about GHG emissions, limited availability of fossil fuels, and global resource stability.1,26 Biomass feedstocks have emerged as a promising alternative to petroleum for polymer production,26 with global biobased polymer manufacturing reaching 4.5 million tons in 2022 and a forecasted CAGR of 14% through 2027.27 More specifically, the biobased PO market is predicted to grow by 20x over the next ten years.28 Braskem’s “I’m Green” PE is the largest-scale bio-PE on the market with 179 kton sold in 2022 and is the first certified bio-PE.29 Other examples of commercial biobased POs include Dow’s ENGAGE REN Polyolefin Elastomers33 and Avient Corporation’s Maxxam BIO POs.30,31 Braskem’s plastics are synthesized from sugarcane ethanol;29 Dow’s polymers are derived from tall oil (a byproduct of wood pulping);30 and Avient’s materials incorporate renewable fillers from cellulose fiber and olive seed powder.31 There are numerous pathways to produce biobased POs, each with advantages and limitations. For example, ethylene can be synthesized biologically through sugar fermentation to dehydrated ethanol or catalytically, as shown in Figure 3A and discussed in the recent review by Dutta.32 Examples of pathways to produce bio-PP are shown in Figure 3B.33 An important consideration to the overall sustainability of biobased POs is the source of the feedstock (i.e., whether it is a first-, second-, or third-generation feedstock). First-generation biomass sources are food crops, and thus, could potentially compete with food production and raise concerns about arable land usage.34 Second- and third-generation biomass (comprised of cellulosic and waste residues/algae for second- and third-generation, respectively) encompass a range of nonedible biomass sources including agricultural/industrial residues, municipal solid waste, and algae.34 Future research could investigate the synthesis of XLPOs from second- and third-generation biomass to potentially alleviate food system and environmental concerns, as discussed in a review on the manufacture of bio-PE from wood waste by Mendieta et al.35 Yet, it is critical to note that just because a biomass feedstock is second/third generation does not necessarily make it more environmentally friendly. For instance, a lifecycle assessment (LCA) on the manufacture of lactic acid from edible corn vs corn stover found that the manufacturing of the corn stover lactic acid had ∼47% increased monetized environmental costs than edible-corn lactic acid, mostly due to the additional pretreatment steps required for the corn stover-based feedstock.36 Therefore, beyond the selection of a non-petroleum feedstock, it is also important to certify the sustainability/carbon neutrality and evaluate the economic/environmental viability of proposed biobased polyolefins. A number of sustainability certification systems exist and were reviewed by Ramirez-Contreras et al.37 One example is the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) framework, which was developed to provide a globally applicable certification system for the sustainability of raw materials and products.38 Other methods for the evaluation of proposed circularity solutions include technoeconomic analysis (TEA) and mass balance accounting (a metric for quantifying circularity) that can apply both to bio-XLPOs and the rest of the strategies described herein.39−41\n\nDespite their potential for environmental impact reduction, bio-XLPOs have yet to be produced commercially. Bio-olefinic monomers can be leveraged to synthesize bio-XLPOs with identical chemical structures (as depicted in Figure 3), manufacturing, and properties vs their petroleum-derived analogues, in a similar manner to the commercially available thermoplastic bio-POs described above.42 The biggest obstacle for drop-in biobased feedstocks is cost–for example, the price of bio-PE currently is ∼1.3–1.5x higher than the price of the petroleum-derived equivalent.43 Yet, for scenarios in which either fossil fuel prices increase or governments enact carbon taxes or similar policies, drop-in alternatives could become more commercially viable.44,45 Biobased XLPOs could improve the sustainability of the monomer feedstock by eliminating the need for virgin fossil fuels and adding temporary carbon sequestration during the biomass growth stage; however, the specific strategy to make bio-XLPO must be evaluated to ensure that the overall process, from feedstock to polymer, leads to a reduction in environmental impacts.46 Furthermore, because the structure of the monomers and final product are identical to traditional XLPOs, the same end-of-life concerns with regards to sustainability exist for bio-XLPOs.41 Thus, although bio-XLPOs can reduce environmental impacts during XLPO production, renewable feedstocks must be used in conjunction with the approaches presented in the following sections to improve overall XLPO circularity.\n\n3. Extending XLPO’s First Lifecycle\n\nThe optimization of XLPO design for longevity decreases carbon emissions by lowering replacement frequency and reducing demand for raw materials and manufacturing. Additionally, the extension of XLPO’s first lifespan mitigates materials disposal challenges, which delays entry into the recycling stream, and thus postpones the need for recycling infrastructure and potentially energy-intensive reprocessing. Sustainability is enhanced because a longer lifespan for XLPO contributes to more efficient management of resources throughout the material lifecycle. An LCA comparing the use portion (often associated with power loss) to the manufacture portion of XLPE cables revealed that manufacture amounts to >2x more global warming potential (GWP; expressed in kg of CO2 equivalents) than use for both overhead and underground cables, (Figure 4) – emphasizing the environmental significance of materials longevity.47 Another LCA suggested that 1 trillion kg of CO2 equivalents are emitted as a result of additional power generation required to compensate for transmission and distribution infrastructure-related power losses (determined by the combination of power generation and uncertainty analysis across 142 countries).48 Infrastructure technical losses that result from limits such as aging (i.e., less efficient) or failing cables require power plants to generate more than 1 kWh to deliver 1 kWh to a customer, and thus, extending XLPE cable’s longevity can improve infrastructure efficiency, decrease the required excess power generation, and reduce GHG emissions.48 In an additional example, XLPE pipes, when substituted for traditional copper pipes in residential water plumbing, reduced building costs by up to 63% and GHG emissions by 42%.49 These GHG and cost savings are mostly due to higher copper installation costs and increased required maintenance, as copper is more prone to corrosion and leaking than XLPE.49 Copper pipes generally have a longer lifecycle than XLPE pipes (50 vs 25 years for copper vs XLPE, respectively), but future research into XLPE formulations to increase longevity to be above that of copper could result in further cost and GHG savings.\n\nThe lifetime of cables has no single determining factor; XLPO insulation plays a considerable role in cable performance, but other variables such as incidents (e.g., weather events, mechanical damage from digging), voltage, ampacity, temperature, and the installation environment are also contributors. Thus, improving cable insulation is beneficial but not the only aspect to consider to enhance overall cable sustainability. One important aspect of insulation performance is that cables may be exposed to electrical stress in a moist environment (e.g., when directly buried in the ground) and are therefore subject to water-tree-growth deterioration.50 Water treeing is a phenomenon in which branching degradation channels, which originate from water contact under electric fields, develop within the insulation of power cables and impair performance and longevity.51 A medium voltage cable lifecycle cost study can provide insights into the advantages of prolonging the lifespan of XLPO materials in this regard. For this scenario, the anticipated 25-year lifespan of XLPE was compared to the anticipated 40-year lifespan of water tree-retardant XLPE (TR-XLPE).52 TR-XLPE is a specific formulation of XLPE designed to resist water treeing through the incorporation of a low-level, nonmigratory additive package to enable longer service life.51 The study revealed a substantial decrease in lifecycle costs for TR-XLPE, with ∼50% total cost savings over the materials lifecycle relative to traditional XLPE.52 The analysis incorporated testing of field-aged cables and accelerated laboratory testing, including the examination of cables buried for 17 years, and showcased the retention of dielectric strength that was augmented by data from accelerated wet-aging tests.52 This significant economic improvement emphasizes the benefits linked to the deliberate selection of materials designed for enhanced longevity. There are also other methods to prepare XLPOs under assisted electric fields that can enhance electric breakdown strength, decrease conductivity, and potentially improve durability/longevity without additional additive incorporation.53 Although negative environmental impacts are anticipated to decrease by prolonging XLPE cable longevity, future LCA is needed to confirm this conjecture; moreover, the effect of additive packages on recyclability needs further investigation.\n\n4. Traditional Mechanical Recycling and Applications for Ground XLPO\n\nMechanical recycling is the most widely adopted recycling technique and is presently considered the most economically feasible method at an industrial scale.54 This approach involves reprocessing plastic waste into secondary raw materials and products through physical means.54 Mechanical recycling has been reviewed extensively for thermoplastic polymers such as POs and also has been applied to XLPO waste for reclamation and reuse.24,55 Unlike many other polymers, sorting XLPO poses fewer challenges, benefiting from specific point sources as opposed to the complex mix found in larger post-consumer recycling plants. Yet, inherent limitations emerge, especially if the cross-linked structure undergoes significant alteration during manufacturing or use.56 One of the major challenges with the mechanical recycling of XLPOs is that neither XLPO nor its resulting recyclate can be molten. Consequently, the recyclate is often incorporated in a blend or composite for processing and is effectively positioned as a filler.\n\nMechanical recycling typically includes collection, sorting, materials comminution (e.g., grinding to controlled particle sizes, typically 50–900 μm, depending on the specific mechanical recycling process),17,56−58 cleaning, reprocessing at different weight ratios, and providing reinforcement for various polymer systems.24,59−61 Based on the XLPO source, the recyclate often contains contaminants–for example, cable recyclate may include 1–2 wt % metal contamination.17Figure 5A-C illustrates examples of spent XLPE cable, representative cable stripped down to XLPE, and XLPE cable ground into smaller particles, respectively. Figure 5D-E compares the tensile properties and thermal stabilities of ground XLPE recyclate to unprocessed XLPE. Figure 5D shows the lower elongation-at-break and higher tensile stress for injection-molded, ground XLPE recyclate relative to injection-molded, unprocessed XLPE (blue vs red curves).17 A higher temperature injection-molding process appeared to slightly decrease the ultimate tensile strength of the final product (green vs blue curves).17Figure 5E illustrates the similarity in thermal stability before and after two recycling times in a thermomechanical batch mixer.62 These two examples are representative of the general trend for XLPOs in which mechanical recycling has a larger effect on tensile properties and a smaller effect on the thermal stabilities. Additionally, in-depth recyclate characterization should be incorporated in future mechanical recycling studies to understand how material degradation resulting from the grinding process impacts XLPO microstructure.\n\n4A. Applications as a Filler\n\nTo overcome potential degradation in performance, recycled XLPO often is blended with virgin PO to achieve desired properties, and fundamental technical variables such as XLPO loading, particle size, and layer separation have been examined to optimize these formulations. Ground, recycled XLPOs generally are reintroduced into virgin thermoplastic materials at relatively low weight percentages (i.e., 1–25 wt %). The addition of XLPO often improves some properties and worsens others–for instance, higher loadings of XLPE in an XLPE/HDPE blend increased impact strength by ∼30% but decreased flexural strength and modulus by ∼10%.57 As a balance must be struck between raising the XLPO loading and maintaining required performance properties, several studies have investigated the optimal XLPO-to-virgin-material ratio for specific processing applications. For example, Diaz et al. demonstrated that up to 35 wt % ground XLPE from cables could be used in a PE matrix for rotational molding applications without a significant reduction in tensile and flexural properties.56 Lindqvist et al. incorporated 25–50 wt % loadings of XLPE from both cable manufacturing waste and end-of-life cables into blends with PP and found that higher XLPE loadings (50 vs 25 wt %) increased strain-at-break and impact strength, but decreased elastic modulus and stress-at-break.58 Furthermore, the blends containing XLPE from end-of-life cables experienced more severe degradation upon aging at 105 °C for six months, although the addition of an antioxidant/metal deactivator (Irganox MD 1024) was successful in retaining mechanical properties over an extended period (accelerated aging for 6000 h).58 In comparison to XLPO loading, particle size appears to have a lesser impact on the overall performance of XLPO blends. For instance, Freitas et al. found that particle size significantly affected only the tensile strength out of five mechanical properties tested (impact strength, tensile strength, tensile strain-at-break, flexural strength, flexural modulus) in XLPE/HDPE blends,57 and White et al. demonstrated that the particle size did not appreciably change the material properties for blends containing reprocessed XLPE when subjected to injection molding under high pressure.17 Beyond investigating XLPO loading and particle size, Diaz et al., showed that multilayer molding improved external appearance and mechanical property retention relative to monolayer molding of an XLPO/PE blend and may enable higher loadings of XLPO going forward.56 Possible next steps should focus on further optimization of these blends and characterization of XLPO blends’ material performance (e.g., thermal stability, UV resistance) beyond the mechanical properties mentioned above.\n\nXLPO blends have already found utility in, or been proposed for, a variety of applications as illustrated by the examples below. Ground XLPE from cable scrap has been compounded into virgin PE matrices that could be used for injection molding of cable guards and packaging articles, extrusion of internal cable jackets, and rotational molding of parts.59 Finely ground XLPO foam has been introduced as a filler to HDPE (up to 30 wt %), which increased impact strength and tensile strength-at-break by over 400% and 40%, respectively, without significantly affecting other mechanical properties.60 XLPE foam aggregates also have been incorporated in non-woven, geotextile composites for floating covers employed in odor/air emission control from manure storage structures.61 These applications grant the recycled material an additional life, though work to determine how many times remolding may be possible is critical to assess the true “circularity” of such materials. Particular attention must be paid to the amount of contamination (particularly from metals in cables and additives in all XLPO formulations), as higher contamination levels can lead to greater degradation over material lifetimes.58\n\nThe behavior at the particle interface and the compatibility between XLPO and the matrix are important considerations for XLPO blends. As XLPO particles are cross-linked, the chemical/physical bonding at the interface with the continuous matrix is likely relatively weak (compared to the interface of a comparable blend without cross-linked particles), leading to poor interfacial adhesion. Lindqvist et al. investigated the compatibility of ground XLPE particles from cable manufacturing waste at 50 wt % loading in a PP matrix using scanning electron microscopy.58 The XLPE particles appeared well dispersed with no visible voids at the interface between the particle and matrix; nonetheless, sharp edges around the particles suggested that the interaction between the two materials was indeed low.58 Fortunately, analysis of blending recycled ground tire rubber into thermoplastic matrices may offer insight into various techniques to enhance XLPO/matrix compatibility.64 These techniques include the use of compatibilizers or coupling agents, nanofillers, and energy treatment, as well as processes like devulcanization and revulcanization to improve the interfacial adhesion and dispersion of the ground tire rubber.64 Similarly, compatibilization approaches have been applied to mixed plastics waste recycling, in which material streams consist of multiple immiscible polymers.65 For example, compatibilizers in the form of block copolymers, non-reactive polar polymers, and reactive functionalized polymers can improve adhesion in plastic/plastic blends.65 Similar compatibilization strategies may be beneficial to the performance of ground XLPO blends.\n\n4B. Applications as an Aggregate\n\nAggregates for building materials are traditionally dominated by sand, gravel, or crushed rock, which can comprise a majority of the total mixture (e.g., ∼80 vol % or 90 wt % for asphalt).66 Traditional aggregates face concerns such as resource scarcity and adverse impacts on the environment in the mining region.67 Mechanically recycled XLPO finds extensive use as an aggregate in construction materials to alleviate these environmental concerns and decrease the overall material weight because XLPO is significantly less dense than traditional aggregates.68 For example, Vidales-Barriguete et al. incorporated XLPE cable waste directly (without any selection or pretreatment) into gypsum boards, such as drywall panels.69 XLPE-containing boards exhibited increased elasticity and marginally improved thermal conductivity and surface comfort while remaining within the necessary compliance values for flexural strength.69\n\nConcrete and cement applications also benefit from the incorporation of mechanically recycled XLPO as an aggregate.70 For instance, Reiterman et al. partially replaced natural sand with crushed cable waste in cement, which slightly improved freeze–thaw resistance and reduced bulk density.68 Although the compressive and flexural strengths of the hardened screed were reduced proportionally with the amount of cable waste, these properties remained within the specified technical requirements.68 Notably, this example of cable waste used a mixture of XLPE, poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), and PE, and it highlights the robustness of such applications to handle less pure XLPO product mixtures.68 The elasticity of XLPO also led to improved cracking resistance properties to concrete and cement.71 Another study assessed the viability of the incorporation of up to 15 vol % XLPE waste as a partial substitute for traditional stone aggregates in concrete.72 Increased XLPE content improved workability and ductility, decreased unit weight and cracking, and maintained compliance with industry standards for compressive strength, as shown in Figure 6.72 This enhanced ductility makes XLPE-containing concrete more suitable for applications that are particularly susceptible to cracking, such as irrigation canals.72 One remaining concern is the risk of aggregate products entering the environment as leachates or microplastics, especially for use cases such as canals. Assessment of this risk is necessary for such applications before full-scale implementation.\n\nA particularly promising avenue for the application of mechanically recycled XLPE is as an aggregate or binder replacement in asphalt, similar to recycled ground tire rubber. XLPE powder has been used as an asphalt modifier to improve thermal stability and significantly reduce melt viscosity, thereby improving asphalt processing.73 The incorporation of waste XLPE also increases material resistance to rutting/fatigue and elasticity of bitumen.74 Additionally, the inclusion of XLPE can decrease the density of asphalt to enable more lightweight structures, improve permanent deformation and temperature resistance, and retain similar water resistance to conventional asphalt.75 Although applications as an aggregate or filler may not result in the higher-value products that can be achieved with advanced recycling techniques, there are a number of existing applications for mechanically recycled XLPO that are already industrially feasible and can be immediately implemented more broadly to improve the circularity of XLPO and the longevity of the systems into which repurposed XLPO is incorporated.\n\n5. Advanced Recycling and Materials Valorization\n\nAdvanced recycling involves the breakdown of XLPOs to create new products and can be classified as de-cross-linking, depolymerization, or deconstruction. De-cross-linking breaks only the cross-links while keeping the polymer backbone intact, depolymerization converts the polymer back to the original monomer, and deconstruction cleaves the polymer into smaller units (Figure 7). Each of these recycling methods leads to varying types of products with enormous ranges in material properties, and thus, each approach may be suitable for different applications.\n\nAlthough a process-based differentiation can be made, herein, advanced recycling strategies were viewed from a product perspective (i.e., recycling thermosets into thermoplastics or recycling thermosets into lighter hydrocarbons, oils, and monomers). The primary reason for this approach is that POs are chain-growth polymers with C–C backbone bonds that require a large amount of energy to break, and PO degradation typically proceeds heterogeneously, which yields a mixture of products, including gases, oils, char, and wax, with wide molecular weight distributions that depend on the feedstock and process conditions.76 Furthermore, due to the more homogeneous molecular structure of peroxide- and radiation-cured XLPOs, it is virtually impossible to break down the structure into small molecules without de-cross-linking. Conversely, it is difficult to selectively target only the cross-links without some cleavage of the main chain. An overview of the advantages and limitations of the advanced recycling methods discussed in this section is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1. XLPO Recycling Strategies with Associated Advantages and Limitations.\n\nMajor Recycling Product Strategy Advantages Limitations Thermoplastics Mechanochemical milling77−80 Reprocessable products, inexpensive Thermal stability, batch process Ultrasonic extrusion81 Reprocessable products Cost, backbone degradation Supercritical fluid de-cross-linking65,82−86 Reprocessable products Higher temperatures and pressures, cost, scalability Oligomers, small molecules, and monomers Pyrolysis87 Higher conversion rates Lower-value products, pollution concerns Catalytic deconstruction88 Higher-value products Higher costs, requires further development Liquefaction89 Capable of handling waste mixtures Higher costs, requires further development\n\nA major consideration for recycling XLPO is the cross-linking chemistry employed, such as peroxide or silane-curing. For example, peroxide-cured XLPE is generally more homogeneously cross-linked than silane-cured XLPE (Si-XLPE); hence, Si-XLPE typically breaks down in a more localized (i.e., less uniform) manner than peroxide-cured XLPE.90 Si-XLPE is more sensitive to property degradation, potentially because of its higher heterogeneity enabling XLPE degradation to occur in local centers with increased reactivity.90 Furthermore, the type of bonds in the cross-link significantly impacts the approach and ease of cleavage. An unsubstituted C–C bond’s dissociation energy is ∼72–87 kcal/mol, whereas a siloxane bond’s dissociation energy is typically >120 kcal/mol, therefore ∼1.4–1.7x more energy is required to break a siloxane bond vs an unsubstituted C–C bond.91 Additional considerations include the degree of cross-linking, additives, cost, and sustainability.\n\n5A. Recycling Thermosets to Thermoplastics\n\nMechanochemistry, in the form of solid-state milling, is a de-cross-linking strategy that has gained recent prominence, with popular strategies including pan-milling and continuous twin-screw extrusion.77,80 Pan-milling, also known as solid-state-shear milling, is a poplar mechanochemistry strategy that grinds material between two rotating planes equipped with teeth designed to induce a combined compression and circumferential shearing impact.78 Pan-milling aims to selectively de-cross-link XLPO, without significant cleavage of the polymer backbone, by preferential breakage at the cross-links as the highest stresses and moments are likely to accumulate at these sites during milling.79 Pan-milling has been used to recycle waste XLPE cables into phosphogypsum-containing composites for applications such as waterproofing.92 In addition to XLPO-related uses, solid-state shear milling has broader applicability in recycling rubber tire waste and has been used to prepare thermoplastic vulcanizates from 50/50 XLPE/tire rubber blends.93\n\nCross-linking in both Si-XLPE and peroxide-cured XLPE has been effectively reduced via pan-milling in several studies, with gel fractions (measured by Soxhlet extraction) decreasing from 77 to 14 wt % and 70 to 15 wt % after 20 cycles for Si- and peroxide-cured XLPE, respectively.77,79 After milling Si-XLPE, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis showed a large reduction in the peak at 1030 cm–1 (corresponding to the siloxane bond −Si–O–Si–) in the milled vs unmilled Si-XLPE.77 Taken together, the gel content reduction and FTIR spectra demonstrate the deconstruction of the cross-links. The molecular weight of the soluble fraction of the XPLE was measured via gel permeation chromatography (GPC) – i.e., GPC was performed on the 30 wt % that is not cross-linked in 70 wt % cross-linked XLPE.77,79 Despite the authors’ claims that an increase in the molecular weight of the soluble fraction for the milled vs unmilled Si-XLPE meant that the de-cross-linking occurred without breakage of the main chain, one could also conclude that the GPC traces indicate that chain scission has occurred because the molecular weight of the soluble fraction after milling is ∼3x lower than the PE molecular weight before cross-linking.77 Reconciliation of the molecular weight data is an essential component in future efforts to determine the extent of backbone degradation during milling. Rheology measurements (e.g., zero-shear viscosity) are one approach that has been implemented to indirectly measure the molecular weight of the de-cross-linked material.80 This method reflects contributions for both the cross-linked and un-cross-linked portions of the polymer through the use of the empirical relationship between the melt viscosity and molecular weight, although differentiating between contributions from chain lengths, branches, cross-links, and fillers remains a challenge.80 Mechanochemistry is considered a cost-effective and environmentally friendly method in comparison to other advanced recycling strategies to reprocess thermosets with the potential to retain better mechanical properties vs traditional mechanical recycling; however, studies are still necessary to address the energy intensity associated with numerous milling cycles, apply mechanochemistry strategies to radiation-cross-linked XLPE, and investigate whether milling results in small molecules that can leach out from the product in a future lifecycle.\n\nUltrasonically aided extrusion also has been investigated as a physical recycling approach, inspired by similar strategies that devulcanize cross-linked rubbers.15,81 In this method, ultrasonic generators are used in conjunction with extruders to reduce melt viscosity, thereby improving processability.94 Huang et al. investigated the de-cross-linking of peroxide-cross-linked HDPE and LDPE with twin-screw, ultrasonically aided extruders and found a reduction in gel content from 93 to 27 wt % and 93 to 61 wt % for cross-linked HPDE and LDPE, respectively.81 Factors that impact the de-cross-linking include the screw design, extruder type, ultrasonic amplitude, and XLPE branching.15,81 Long-chain branching in cross-linked LDPE enhances breakage of the main chain because long chains reduce the material’s ability to change configuration when subjected to strong biaxial deformation, which possibly causes increased stretching in the XLPE and backbone degradation.81 Ultrasonic extrusion has the potential for increased throughput; however, the abovementioned polymer backbone degradation and high costs may be problematic.15\n\nAnother advanced recycling strategy investigated for XLPO de-cross-linking leverages supercritical fluids, which are excellent plastics decomposition media.65 Peroxide-, radiation-, and siloxane-cross-linked XLPEs have been de-cross-linked with supercritical alcohols, including methanol, ethanol, and propanol. Methanol is the most common reaction medium because of its relatively mild critical conditions [critical temperature (Tc) = 240 °C, critical pressure (Pc) = 8.1 MPa] and high efficacy.95 For example, Cho et al. completely de-cross-linked XLPE in supercritical methanol, with the gel content decreasing from 88 to 0 wt %.83 Other studies have proposed swapping supercritical alcohol for supercritical water to alleviate the toxicity concerns associated with methanol; however, supercritical water has a higher Tc and Pc, (Tc = 374 °C, Pc = 22.1 MPa), which makes potential recycling systems more expensive than those using supercritical alcohols.82,84,96 Furthermore, de-cross-linking with supercritical water has only been demonstrated successfully on Si-XLPE, but the process has not been extended to peroxide- or radiation-cured XLPE.82,84 A major concern associated with supercritical fluid de-cross-linking is that most proposed strategies were run in batch reactors, and thus need to be adapted to continuous setups to improve scaleup feasibility and costs.85 Baek et al. de-cross-linked peroxide-cured XLPE in a continuous, multiscale single-screw extrusion process at a feeding rate of 7 mL/min with the XLPE in contact with the supercritical fluid for <2 min,85 but this feeding rate is still relatively slow; hence more work is required to scale these systems and address concerns about industrial suitability stemming from higher costs.\n\nThe ultimate recyclate properties are important considerations for all the above de-cross-linking techniques. The work by Zack et al., which employed a solid-state shear pulverization de-cross-linking strategy on peroxide-cross-linked XLPE and achieved a minimum gel content of 2%, is presented as a case study of de-cross-linked XLPO recyclate performance.80 Test results of the recyclate compared to un-cross-linked LDPE and unprocessed XLPE [referred to as cross-linked linear low-density polyethylene (XLLDPE)] as controls are shown in Figure 8A-C. Because the recyclate has a degree of cross-linking between those of the LDPE and XLLDPE, one may expect the recyclate to exhibit behavior between those of the LDPE and XLLDPE; this expected behavior is demonstrated in the parallel plate and torque rheology experiments. Conversely, the stress–strain curves show recyclate properties that are outside the ranges of either control, which suggests that the de-cross-linked recyclate is more branched, and with a deteriorated backbone, than the starting thermoplastic. Thermal properties of the recyclate [specifically, Tm, thermal decomposition temperature (Td), and crystallization temperature] were impacted significantly less than tensile properties, similar to the mechanical recyclate discussed in the previous section. Together, these results provide a detailed picture of the impacts of the de-cross-linking process on the chain architecture and macromolecular structure and are generally representative of other recycling studies, such as those that employ ultrasonic and critical fluid de-cross-linking techniques.81,85 Even in a de-cross-linking study that showed reduced gel content to 0%, the tensile and rheological properties of the de-cross-linked XLPO did not match those of thermoplastic PO, further emphasizing the impact of de-cross-linking strategies on molecular architecture and therefore also crystallinity.83 Future studies should investigate how these changes impact the ability of the de-cross-linked XLPOs to be successfully re-cross-linked in a closed-loop recycling approach, and if possible, how the properties of the recycled XLPOs compare to those of virgin materials.\n\n5B. Recycling Thermosets into Oligomers and Small Molecules\n\nPyrolysis is a compelling route to handle mixed plastics or difficult-to-recycle materials at relatively high temperatures.65 Plastics waste pyrolysis primarily yields liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons, char, and wax, and the distribution of products depends on operating conditions such as temperature, pressure, catalyst choice, type of feedstock, and reactor design.97 The generation of syngas (a mixture of H2 and CO) from pyrolysis is also a focus of current research because syngas is a valuable intermediate in the synthesis of numerous industrial chemicals, ranging from liquid fuels and lubricants to alcohols, aldehydes, olefins, and ammonia.98 Yet thus far, there has been little research on syngas production from XLPO pyrolysis. In one study, Singh et al. used pyrolysis and CO2-assisted gasification (performed at 900 °C, with syngas yields of 80 and 250 wt % for pyrolysis and gasification, respectively, wherein the gasification yield is >100% because the yield is calculated on an XLPO-basis, but the CO2 also reacts to produce syngas) of XLPE to generate syngas with a similar energy heating value to natural gas.87 More work is needed to understand the kinetics and transport phenomena associated with these processes in large-scale reactors.87\n\nCatalytic approaches, such as catalytic pyrolysis, also have been considered for the recycling of XLPOs, as the leveraging of catalysts typically enables lower operating temperatures and results in liquid products.88 For example, Straka et al. investigated the catalytic pyrolysis of XLPE from cable and pipe manufacturing scraps with Ru-based catalysts at 450–470 °C.88 The process achieved an 87–91 wt % yield of hydrocarbon oil, a possible intermediate to synthesize value-added products such as solvents, industrial oils, lubricants, and fuels.88 Thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry techniques have been used to illuminate the consequences of cross-linking degree on the pyrolytic decomposition behavior of peroxide-cross-linked XLPE, both in the presence and absence of a typical fluid cracking zeolite catalyst.89 The inclusion of a catalyst enabled a ∼60 °C decrease in pyrolysis temperature, but the catalyzed process was more sensitive to the degree of cross-linking, with higher operating temperatures required for increased degrees of cross-linking–as the cross-linked matrix was suggested to hinder the mobility of PE chains and hence the interaction with the catalyst’s active sites.89 Future efforts are appropriate to determine the catalyst’s effect on deconstruction yields and product distributions, and there is a significant opportunity to leverage other catalytic deconstruction approaches (e.g., hydrocracking, hydrogenolysis) to recycle XLPO.\n\nOther advanced recycling technologies, such as hydrothermal and solvothermal liquefaction that run at high temperatures and pressures in the presence of water and organic solvents, respectively, can depolymerize XLPOs and yield monomers, platform chemicals, or fuel oil.99 Liu et al. investigated the depolymerization of LLDPE and XLPE from cable waste in water, acetone, and methanol under liquefaction conditions with the resulting product streams containing gas, oil, and solid fractions.99 Acetone liquefication at 350 °C for 90 min (optimal performance conditions) achieved a conversion of 75%, oil yield of 39%, energy recovery of 40%, and higher heating values of 44 MJ/kg for the oil samples, along with a lower-boiling-range molecular distribution.99 The oil fraction contained alkanes and alkenes within carbon ranges of C14 to C31 and C16 to C21, respectively.99 Although the study did not include a detailed compositional analysis of the gas phase, it is expected that this product stream mostly would include short alkanes and alkenes because of the lack of selectivity of random chain scission. Liquefaction is a promising strategy to transform spent XLPOs into valuable chemicals/fuels at the end of its first materials lifecycle; however, future work is necessary to optimize the process to reduce reaction temperatures/times and selectively tune mixtures for specific applications.\n\nMost of the above approaches are still in their experimental stage and have been validated only at laboratory scale. The petrochemical industry is investigating the pyrolysis of XLPO into fuel as the most feasible, large-scale, XLPO advanced recycling technique, and preliminary results suggest that the product of pyrolysis-treated XLPE is a suitable cracker feedstock to make new PE.100 To realize this technology at scale, it is important to streamline the fragmented XLPO waste collection process and supply chain. Furthermore, detailed TEA/LCA of the advanced recycling methods would be beneficial to identify the most promising approaches, highlight the remaining challenges, and evaluate industrial scalability.\n\n6. Redesigning XLPOs with Dynamic Covalent Chemistries\n\nIt remains critical to develop sustainable end-of-life solutions for the XLPOs already produced, but inherent difficulties in reprocessing will continue to be a challenge for XLPOs. Thus, there is an opportunity to redesign the next generation of XLPOs with end-of-life options in mind (i.e., “recyclable-by-design”). Recyclable-by-design polymers can be achieved through the incorporation of dynamic covalent chemistries in which traditional covalent cross-links are replaced with reprocessable bonds (i.e., those that can exchange or disassociate under certain stimuli, such as heat, light, pH, or solvent). These dynamic covalent chemistries include covalent adaptive networks (CANs), dissociative reactive networks, and vitrimers (i.e., a specific set of CANs in which bonds exchange under a heat stimulus without an intermediate state of disconnection).101,102 There are many proposed dynamic covalent chemistries with great potential for reprocessability that have been the subject of several recent reviews,101,103,104 including one specifically focused on PO vitrimers by Ahmadi et al.105 In this section, the most common dynamic chemistries that have been applied to POs (shown in Figure 9) and key considerations for success on an industrial scale are highlighted. Dynamic covalent chemistry-based POs are promising alternatives to XLPOs, yet dynamic covalent chemistry is a relatively new arena for this application. Thus, it is important to note that more study is required, particularly concerning material longevity, before dynamic covalent chemistries can be implemented in XLPO-related spaces, as discussed below.\n\nIn addition to the dynamic covalent chemistries shown in Figure 9, another option to redesign XLPOs for circularity is to substitute thermoplastic POs for XLPOs when possible. For example, Green et al. completed several studies on the substitution of a blend of slow-crystallized thermoplastic PEs for XLPEs in cable insulations.112 These blends have acceptable electrical properties (e.g., low dielectric loss), decent thermal properties (e.g., Tm ∼ 130 °C), and sufficient reprocessability, as the blends are not cross-linked.112 Others have investigated XLPO alternatives such as thermoplastic PE–PP copolymer blends that form physical cross-links113 and thermoplastic PP, which was covered in a review by Li et al.114 Additional testing is required to understand whether these thermoplastic alternatives can meet all the technical specifications (e.g., mechanical properties, chemical resistance, durability) required of XLPOs for many applications. Other dynamic covalent chemistries not shown in Figure 9 that have been applied to POs are Diels–Alder and imine chemistries.115,116 Both chemistries have been more commonly applied to polyolefin-based rubbers. For example, Diels–Alder reactions have been employed after grafting maleic anhydride on the backbones of ethylene/propylene and ethylene/vinyl acetate rubbers.117 Dynamic imine bonds also have been used in ethylene/propylene rubber by first introducing aldehyde pendent groups to the chains and then adding an amine cross-linking agent.118 These chemistries exhibit excellent reprocessability, but further characterization is needed to determine important performance metrics, such as Tm and tensile properties.115,116\n\nA comparison of several important thermal and mechanical properties of PE vitrimers and commercial XLPE is shown in Table 2. In addition to the HDPE and LDPE vitrimers and properties included in this table, several studies also have applied dynamic chemistries to other POs, such as PP and LLDPE.11,119 The Tms of the dynamically cross-linked PEs are closely related to whether they have an HPDE or LDPE backbone, as the Tms of LDPE and HDPE are 95–105 and 120–140 °C, respectively.120 PP has a Tm near 165 °C, and thus, PP vitrimers generally have higher Tms than PE vitrimers.120 For instance, Kar et al. synthesized transesterification-based vitrimers from HDPE and PP with Tms of 133 and 166 °C, respectively.121 Therefore, PP-based vitrimers may be a better fit than PE vitrimers for higher-temperature applications. In terms of mechanical properties, the tensile strength and elongation-at-break for many of the dynamically cross-linked chemistries are within the range of commercial XLPE. A notable exception to the mechanical property trends is silyl ether exchange-based vitrimer, in which lower tensile strengths and elongations-at-breaks are exhibited relative to the other vitrimers in Table 2. There is an opportunity to increase these metrics by adding bulkier substituents onto the silyl ether group.109 Vinylogous urethane exchange chemistries also possess lower elongations-at-break, but future work to produce HDPE vinylogous urethane exchange-based vitrimers would be expected to increase those values. It is also worth noting that XLPOs do not have a Tm, like vitrimers can, and a normal operating temperature range is provided instead. In cables, the standard operating temperature rating for XLPE is 90–105 °C, the emergency overload temperature is 130–140 °C (i.e., an elevated temperature outside of normal operation that a cable can withstand for a limited time period), and the short circuit rating (i.e., the highest temperature that a cable can withstand for ∼0.5 s) is 250 °C.122 Thus, vitrimers that would be molten by 130 °C, let alone 250 °C, would not be an acceptable substitute for cable applications with current formulations, and some amount of chemical cross-linking and/or high degrees of entanglement may be required to achieve the thermal properties necessary for cable insulation.113,123\n\nTable 2. Comparison of Critical Thermal and Mechanical Properties of XLPE vs Dynamically Cross-linked PE.\n\nDynamic Chemistry Type of PE Tm (°C) Tensile Strength (MPa) Elongation-at-Break (%) Transesterification106,121,124 HDPE/LDPE 128–133/105 17–21/16–20 620–710/400 Disulfide Exchange107,123 HDPE/LDPE 130/106 Not reported Not reported Boronic Ester Exchange102,111,125 HDPE 124–128 15–27 436–675 Silyl Ether Exchange109,126 PE-HEMAa 72 3 250 Siloxane Exchange108 HDPE 127 19–20 380–400 Vinylogous Urethane Exchange110 LDPE 97–110 16–17 85–105 Commercial XLPE122 LDPE 90–105b 16–22 350–550\n\nThe critical properties that recyclable-by-design POs must meet to be commercially viable as XLPO substitutes ultimately depend on the application. These use case-specific performance properties include thermal stability, electrical and chemical resistance, weatherability, and durability. Silyl ether/siloxane exchange chemistry has been reported as the most thermally stable dynamic cross-linker (Td,5 = 427 °C), and thus, is of particular interest for cable applications.108,109 It is also worth noting that siloxane chemistry is the most chemically similar to Si-XLPE. Therefore, siloxane chemistry may have the potential to perform the closest to Si-XLPE, which makes siloxane vitrimers promising for traditional Si-XLPE applications, such as low-voltage cables and pipes. Additionally, impact strength, stress-crack resistance, and electrical and chemical resistance are key XLPO metrics that have not been broadly characterized for dynamically cross-linked POs germane to cables. An example of the type of electrical testing required for cables is the conduction of breakdown voltage tests on thin films or mini cables to assess dielectric strength, as was done by Green et al.112 Breakdown testing in this study demonstrated that their recyclable-by-design formulations outperformed XLPE and LDPE controls.112 Moreover, many applications for XLPOs are exposed to a variety of elements (e.g., UV radiation, water, wind) and are expected to last decades. Industrial characterization commonly determines the durability and weatherability of XLPO formulations with accelerated aging tests, and these tests are necessary to further the translation of dynamic covalent chemistry research efforts.127\n\nThe scalability of initial processing approaches and retention of thermomechanical properties after multiple reprocessing cycles are important factors in determining the industrial feasibility of recyclable-by-design chemistries. Traditional XLPOs generally are compounded via extrusion, and therefore, many of the previously mentioned studies implemented reactive extrusion synthesis strategies that are expected to be economically scalable and feasible by leveraging existing industrial extrusion systems.102,106,108,110,111,121,125,126 Rheological investigations or the common industrial metric, MFI, can provide further insight into the processability of dynamically cross-linked PO formulations. Additionally, curing methods/times and any other processing steps required must be taken into consideration when evaluating the scalability of these chemistries. To demonstrate reprocessability, the dynamic cross-linked POs must retain mechanical properties over at least three reprocessing cycles. For instance, Tellers et al. synthesized LDPE vinylogous urethane-based vitrimers that exhibited >80% retention of tensile strength after four cycles of reprocessing.110 It is also of critical importance to consider the potential trade-offs between fast reprocessing and performance properties, as materials with faster stress relaxation times may display larger creep.103 Dynamic covalent chemistries with lower activation energies (Eas) will be easier to reprocess but less creep resistant, which can worsen lifetime material performance.103 To improve creep resistance, one strategy is to increase Ea; however, if the vitrimer’s Ea is too high, a catalyst may be necessary or the reprocessing conditions may become too costly.103 Of the chemistries described in this section, boronic ester exchange has the lowest Ea of ∼16 kJ/mol, whereas the rest of the chemistries (other than silyl ether exchange, which was not reported) have Eas > 100 kJ/mol.102,107,108,110,121,126 Other than raising the Ea, the introduction of a level of permanent cross-linking in addition to dynamic cross-linking is highly effective at reducing creep and retaining reprocessability.103,128 For example, with the incorporation of 40 mol % permanent cross-links into a disulfide-based vitrimer, creep resistance was reduced by ≥65%, and reprocessability was maintained.128 Creep is also highly temperature dependent, as demonstrated by disulfide-based CANs synthesized by Bin Rusayyis et al.123 The CANs exhibited excellent creep resistance at 70 °C (0.75% creep strain after ∼14 h subjected to continuous 3.0 kPa stress) but significantly lower creep resistance at 90 °C (∼7.1% creep strain under the same 3.0 kPa stress).123 Overcoming creep resistance continues to be a challenge for the commercial implementation of dynamic covalent chemistries, and thus, future research is needed to identify those chemistries best suited to balance performance and (re)processability for XLPO applications.\n\nAlong with balancing (re)processing and creep resistance, there are other remaining concerns before these chemistries can be translated to commercial scales. Silyl ethers and boronic esters are susceptible to irreversible hydrolysis when exposed to heat and water.107,108 Boronic ester, disulfide, and dynamic vinylogous urethane bonds are susceptible to oxidation, and thus premature exchange, which limits robustness.103,104 Transesterification and silyl ether/siloxane exchange chemistries can have high costs, along with potential leaching and corrosion concerns associated with catalysts.103,104 To better understand and overcome these remaining challenges, further characterization, in particular for longevity and application-specific properties, is required. As previously mentioned, introducing some amount of permanent cross-links and/or physical cross-links into dynamically cross-linking applications may be necessary to balance performance properties and recyclability.113,123 Furthermore, most of the research to date has focused on the introduction of dynamic cross-links to upcycle plastics waste and has compared the properties to thermoplastic POs but not XLPOs. One exception is the study by Fenimore et al. on disulfide exchange-based POs directly compared PO vitrimer properties to those of analogous XLPOs.107 It was found that the LDPE vitrimers had similar levels of cross-linking to traditional LDPE-based XLPE and that the vitrimers could be formulated to have similar thermomechanical properties to virgin XLPE (specifically for elastic storage modulus (E’) rubbery plateaus of 0.52 vs 0.55 MPa for vitrimers and XLPE, respectively).107 Although challenges remain, this study is an example of the type of direct comparison to traditional XLPOs useful in further studies to assess the promise of dynamic cross-linked materials. Finally, LCA also is needed to determine whether these chemistries lead to a reduction in environmental impacts relative to traditional XLPOs.\n\n7. Outlook: Remaining Challenges and Directions for Future Research\n\nThere are many promising research directions for translating the work done on thermoplastic POs to XLPOs. In particular, a number of catalytic and pyrolysis strategies have been successfully applied to thermoplastic POs, as described in recent reviews.129,130 For instance, several catalysts have been identified to cleave the C–C bonds in POs to yield liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons.131−134 Hancock et al. used Ru nanoparticles on a carbon catalyst to convert PE into liquid alkanes under relatively mild reaction conditions (200–250 °C, 20–50 bar H2).134 Wang et al. converted LDPE to diesel, wax, and lubricants over a Ru supported on tungstated zirconia catalyst (250 °C, 50 bar H2 for 2h).132 In another example, Liu et al. leveraged the synergistic effects between POs and biomass in a co-pyrolysis process to enhance the desired product yield (e.g., syngas).135 Biological deconstruction is also a promising advanced plastics recycling option that is energy-efficient and highly selective.130 For instance, Sowmya et al. isolated the fungus Penicillium simplicissimum from a local dumpsite to biodegrade PE, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy confirmed the formation of aromatic and alkene protons, groups absent from the starting PE.136 Although biological deconstruction has not been studied on XLPOs to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is an opportunity to examine whether any of the previously identified thermoplastic PO degradation enzymes and microorganisms also can act on XLPO substrates.136,137\n\nOpportunities also exist for the translation of other areas of materials research to XLPOs, such as functionalization, devulcanization, and compatibilization. Learnings can be applied from other cross-linked systems, in particular vulcanized rubbers, to XLPOs and vice versa. A number of devulcanization methods have been probed, especially in the context of waste tire rubber, which could provide insight into XLPO de-cross-linking.138 Compatibilization has been investigated to improve the adhesion of rubber wastes in blends to improve the overall performance properties of the recycled material, an approach that could be applied to the XLPO blends discussed in Section 4.139 Moreover, PO functionalization research can be applied to XLPOs. Maleic anhydride grafting is the most common strategy to functionalize C–H groups, but there has been a growing interest to activate C–H bonds through other means, resulting in the selective conversion of C–H bonds to bonds such as C–C, C–N, C–B, and C–S, as reviewed by Williamson et al.140 POs also have been functionalized by the introduction of in-chain double bonds via dehydrogenation or by oxidation.141 These valorization approaches open the door for other chemistries to be harnessed to broaden the scope for recyclable-by-design XLPOs or to functionalize ground XLPOs for higher-value applications. In short, a considerable number of opportunities exist by applying adjacent areas of materials research to XLPOs.\n\nManufacturing steps, such as cross-linking and curing can consume considerable energy, release undesired byproducts from the decomposition of organic peroxides, and contribute significantly to the overall environmental impact of an XLPO product.142 For example, manufacturing emits >2x more GHG emissions vs use for cables, as discussed in Section 3.47 In recognition of this point, there has been recent work to reduce curing times/temperatures and choose synthesis procedures that avoid the generation of toxic byproducts.142 There are additional opportunities to increase circularity in the production of XLPOs with regards to material inputs, such as upcycling thermoplastic PO waste to XLPO (i.e., substituting recycled POs as a material input for virgin PE) or incorporating biobased cross-linkers. For instance, Fenimore et al. employed post-consumer recycled (PCR) LDPE and HDPE to synthesize PE vitrimers,107 and Dey et al. used biobased cross-linkers to synthesize PCR–PP vitrimers with 90% retention of mechanical properties after five reprocessing cycles.143 Biobased peroxides also have been developed for the formulation of industrial hardeners, although they have not yet been applied to XLPO systems.144 The effects of the PCR purity and biobased cross-linkers on the long-term properties of XLPOs require additional evaluation, and future research should investigate if other steps within XLPO manufacturing (e.g., transportation, formulation design, compounding, product distribution) can be streamlined to further alleviate environmental impacts.\n\nA remaining challenge for XLPO circularity is the impact of additives on the strategies discussed throughout this review. Common additives used in XLPOs include stabilizers such as antioxidants, color concentrates, flame retardants, and carbon black (for conductivity or UV-weathering resistance).145−147 Additive packages vary from product to product, which adds another layer of uncertainty to XLPO circularity solutions, and the specific additives present have been shown to have significant consequences for thermoplastic PO recycling, especially for catalytic approaches. For instance, phenolic antioxidants reduced catalyst activity by 50% in the deconstruction of HDPE employing a Pt/WO3/ZrO2 catalyst system.148 Another example that highlights the impact of additives on the ultimate recyclate value is the difference in the price of natural vs colored mechanically recycled HDPE ($0.75 vs $0.23/lb for natural and colored HDPE, respectively in the United States in 2021).149 As additives are critical for the processing and performance of commercial XLPOs, it is vital to investigate the impact of additives on proposed recycling processes and develop solutions in the case that they interfere. Such remedies could include preprocessing steps to strip additives out of XLPOs, screening process conditions for robustness, or developing additive formulations more tolerable to the chosen circularity method.\n\nBalancing performance, cost, scalability, and circularity poses a major challenge in achieving complete circularity for XLPOs. Many XLPO applications necessitate high-purity materials to achieve extended lifecycles, which will have a large effect on the choice of circularity strategy. For instance, using upcycled POs in XLPO formulations could improve circularity and reduce costs but likely would demand stringent purity standards, or robust formulations and applications capable of handling any impurities to achieve the required performance. Furthermore, sustainable solutions will need to be either cost-competitive or subsidized with current methods to break into the market. Inevitably, there will be no one-size-fits-all remedy to improving the circularity of XLPO. Nonetheless, by employing a combination of circularity strategies discussed in this review and those yet to be uncovered, a significant opportunity exists to markedly improve the lifecycle circularity of both current and future XLPOs.\n\n8. Conclusions\n\nThe circularity of XLPOs has been relatively overlooked by the sustainable materials research community, yet numerous approaches present opportunities to enhance the circularity of this substantial and growing plastics waste stream. This review has highlighted solutions spanning the materials lifecycle, such as using biobased feedstocks, extending materials longevity, enabling circularity through mechanical and advanced recycling methods, and redesigning chemistries for circularity in next-generation XLPOs. Recent advances in plastics design, especially those targeting thermoplastic POs, offer promising future research directions for increased XLPO sustainability, but challenges remain to balance performance, cost, scalability, and circularity. Overall, there are several opportunities to transition from the current linear lifecycle of XLPOs to a more circular lifecycle and from the laboratory to industrial application.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nA.J.S. and T.H.E. would like to thank the National Science Foundation (NSF) Growing Convergence Research program (NSF GCR CMMI 1934887) in Materials Life Cycle Management for support during the writing of this work.

      "# [Furandicarboxylic Acid Dimethyl Ester (FDME) Manufacturers](https://www.sugar-energy.com/product/2-5-furandicarboxylicacid-dimethyl-ester.html)\n1. What is FDME and How is it Produced?\n\n2,5-Furandicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester (FDME) is a vital bio-based chemical intermediate that has attracted significant interest in various industries due to its renewable origins and wide range of applications. FDME is produced through the oxidation and esterification of hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), a compound derived from biomass sources like fructose and glucose. This production process makes FDME part of the broader trend towards utilizing renewable resources in chemical manufacturing, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and contributing to the sustainability of industrial processes.\n\nThe molecular structure of FDME, denoted by the formula C8H8O5, features two ester groups attached to a furan ring. This structure imparts FDME with unique chemical properties, such as its ability to easily participate in polymerization reactions. FDME has a molecular weight of 184.15 g/mol, and its physical properties further reflect its stability and usefulness in various chemical reactions. It has a melting point of 117.6℃, indicating its solid state at room temperature, and a boiling point of 270.9℃ at 760 mmHg, showing its stability under standard atmospheric conditions. Additionally, FDME has a relative density of 1.244 g/cm³, which is typical for organic esters and contributes to its ease of handling and storage.\n\nOne of the key advantages of FDME is its stability, particularly when stored in sealed containers at room temperature. This stability is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the chemical during transportation and storage, making FDME a reliable raw material for various industrial processes. The production of FDME is a relatively straightforward process, often involving catalytic oxidation of HMF followed by esterification. This process not only yields a high-purity product but also aligns with the principles of green chemistry, reducing the environmental impact of chemical production. As industries continue to seek sustainable and renewable alternatives to petrochemical-based products, FDME stands out as a promising candidate for a wide range of applications.\n\n2. Applications of FDME in Polymer Synthesis\n\nThe most prominent application of FDME lies in the polymer industry, where it is used as a key monomer in the production of polyethylene furanoate (PEF). PEF is a biobased polyester that is increasingly seen as a sustainable alternative to traditional petroleum-based plastics like polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The production of PEF involves the transesterification polymerization of FDME with ethylene glycol, resulting in a polyester that offers several advantages over PET. These advantages include superior barrier properties against gases like oxygen and carbon dioxide, which makes PEF an ideal material for packaging applications, particularly in the food and beverage industry.\n\nThe use of FDME in PEF production is not only beneficial from a performance standpoint but also from an environmental perspective. PEF is derived entirely from renewable resources, which significantly reduces the carbon footprint associated with its production compared to traditional plastics. Additionally, PEF is fully recyclable, aligning with the global push towards a circular economy where materials are reused and recycled rather than disposed of. The incorporation of FDME into PEF also enhances the material's mechanical properties, such as tensile strength and thermal stability, making it suitable for a wide range of applications beyond packaging, including textiles and automotive parts.\n\nBeyond its use in PEF, FDME is also being explored for the production of other types of polymers. Researchers are investigating the potential of FDME to create new classes of polyesters and polyamides, which could offer further improvements in properties such as biodegradability, strength, and resistance to heat and chemicals. These developments highlight the versatility of FDME as a monomer and its potential to drive innovation in the polymer industry. As demand for sustainable materials continues to grow, FDME is poised to play a critical role in the development of next-generation polymers that meet the needs of both industry and the environment."
