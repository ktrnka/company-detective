      "# [Perle AI](https://www.perle.ai/resources/2025-ai-training-data-trends-the-future-of-domain-specific-ai-rlhf-and-custom-tooling)\n2025 AI Training Data Trends: The Future of Domain-Specific AI, RLHF, and Custom Tooling\n\n‍\n\nAI innovation is reaching an inflection point: models are only as good as the data they’re trained on. While breakthroughs in model architecture have dominated recent years, 2025 marks a pivotal shift—human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning (RLHF), domain expertise, and custom annotation tooling are now the cornerstones of high-performing AI systems. From automating structured labeling to leveraging industry-specific data, here’s how AI teams can stay ahead of the curve.\n\n1. Beyond Unstructured Data: The Need for Domain-Specific Labeling\n\nThe AI landscape is drowning in unstructured data—text, images, videos, speech, sensor outputs—but raw data alone won’t drive innovation. The next frontier is high-fidelity, domain-specific annotation. Models trained with generic datasets struggle with real-world complexities, whether in biomedical research, geospatial intelligence, or financial forecasting.\n\nBy combining RLHF and STEM expertise, AI teams can create highly structured datasets tailored to their industries. This blend of subject-matter experts (SMEs) and machine-assisted annotation significantly enhances AI model accuracy and adaptability. Custom tooling further optimizes this process by providing precision labeling workflows, enabling scalable and efficient data curation.\n\n‍2. RLHF and Iterative Labeling: Enhancing Model Precision\n\nReinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is transforming AI training, allowing models to learn from expert-validated corrections rather than relying solely on static datasets. This is particularly critical for:\n\n- Conversational AI, where linguistic nuance and cultural context matter.\n\n- Complex decision-making AI, such as in healthcare or finance.\n\n- Autonomous systems, which require real-time adaptability.\n\nRLHF-driven annotation workflows ensure continuous model refinement, preventing drift and ensuring AI remains aligned with human expectations. As AI systems become more complex, integrating iterative labeling—where models continuously learn from new data inputs and expert interventions—will be essential for maintaining state-of-the-art performance.\n\n3. Automating Annotation with Custom Tooling\n\nTraditional annotation bottlenecks slow down AI innovation. Custom annotation tools, built to seamlessly integrate AI-assisted and human-led workflows, are revolutionizing the way datasets are curated. Cutting-edge AI training data platforms now offer:\n\n- Automated Pre-Labeling: AI-driven pre-annotations speed up workflows, reducing human effort by up to 60%.\n\n- Active Learning Integration: Algorithms prioritize the most uncertain samples, ensuring human annotators focus on high-impact labeling tasks.\n\n- Customizable Workflows: No more one-size-fits-all solutions—tailored interfaces for different industries streamline multi-modal annotation (text, image, audio, and video).\n\nThese advancements significantly enhance annotation efficiency, reducing errors, optimizing QA pipelines, and enabling rapid scalability.\n\n4. Industry-Specific Data Labeling: Why One-Size-Fits-All Won’t Work\n\nGeneralized datasets aren’t enough to power AI solutions in STEM-heavy fields. Consider:\n\n‍\n\n- Life sciences: AI models need rigorously annotated molecular datasets for drug discovery.\n\n- Manufacturing: Predictive maintenance AI relies on sensor data, requiring specialized labeling expertise.\n\n- Cybersecurity: AI models for phishing detection must be trained on real-world scam patterns curated by domain experts.\n\nOrganizations leveraging tailored data pipelines, SME-driven annotation, and custom tooling will gain a competitive edge in accuracy, efficiency, and deployment readiness.\n\n‍\n\n5. The Rise of Synthetic Data in AI Training\n\nWhile real-world data remains critical, synthetic data is filling the gaps where acquiring annotated samples is costly, privacy-sensitive, or simply infeasible. AI-generated datasets:\n\n- Enhance rare-event detection (e.g., fraud detection, disease diagnostics).\n\n- Overcome data scarcity challenges in emerging AI applications.\n\n- Reduce bias by generating balanced training sets, improving fairness in AI.\n\nBy integrating synthetic data with human-curated ground truth labels, AI models achieve higher generalization capabilities while maintaining domain-specific accuracy.\n\n‍\n\nConclusion: Future-Proofing AI with Smarter Data Strategies\n\n2025 is the year AI teams must rethink their data pipelines. The combination of RLHF, domain expertise, and customizable annotation tooling will set apart high-performing AI systems from those that stagnate. Organizations that invest in tailored annotation solutions, iterative model refinement, and high-fidelity STEM data will lead the next generation of AI advancements.\n\nFor teams looking to streamline AI data annotation, the future isn’t about collecting more data—it’s about curating the right data with the right tools. AI excellence starts with precision, automation, and human expertise working in unison.\n\n‍",

      "# [Perle AI](https://www.perle.ai/resources/the-kyc-arms-race-when-scammers-get-ai-superpowers)\nWe are now in an age that increasingly seems like a Black Mirror episode where technology can create unnerving, perfect replicas of the real-world. Something that previously seemed like a lifetime away as we viewed it on television is now our daily reality in KYC verification. We're battling against an army of synthetic identities so convincing they make you question your own perception of what is real.\n\nThe New Breed of Fraudsters\n\nThe landscape of identity fraud has evolved dramatically. Today's scammers are running operations with AI-generated:\n\nDeepfake selfies that blink, move, and respond just like a real person\n\nSynthetic identities mixing real and fake information\n\nDocument forgeries generated at scale with concerning accuracy\n\nFor financial institutions, this isn't just a compliance issue—it's an existential threat. When fraudsters can create thousands of convincing fake identities, traditional verification methods require significant reinforcement.\n\nThe Hidden Vulnerability: Your Annotation Workforce\n\nAt Perle, we've identified a critical vulnerability that few are discussing: the annotators themselves.\n\nThe same AI-powered threats targeting financial institutions can be turned against the very systems designed to stop them. What happens when scammers infiltrate the annotation workforce? When the people training your fraud detection systems are the same ones trying to circumvent them?\n\nThis creates a particularly insidious challenge:\n\nInsider knowledge becomes a weapon. A malicious annotator gains intimate understanding of detection systems while simultaneously helping scammers identify blind spots.\n\nTrust verification becomes paramount. How do you verify the verifiers? When annotators work remotely across global regions, traditional vetting falls short.\n\nData integrity faces new threats. Without proper safeguards, bad actors could manipulate training data to create deliberate weaknesses in fraud detection models.\n\nSecurity and payment systems create vectors. Conventional workforce management creates numerous opportunities for identity fraud within the annotation process itself.\n\nBuilding a Fortress Around the Annotation Process\n\nAt Perle, we're taking a fundamentally different approach to securing the annotation ecosystem:\n\nRigorous annotator vetting. We've implemented multi-layered identity verification for our own workforce that goes well beyond standard background checks, applying the same KYC principles we use for financial clients to our own team members.\n\nZero-trust annotation architecture. We assume verification can fail at any point and build redundant checking mechanisms that can catch malicious activity even if initial security measures are compromised.\n\nContinuous monitoring systems. Advanced behavioral analytics track annotation patterns to detect abnormalities that might indicate compromised accounts or deliberate sabotage attempts.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe reality is clear: while most companies focus exclusively on improving their KYC algorithms, they're overlooking a critical vulnerability in who trains those systems. Scammers have already figured this out, and they're targeting the foundation of AI-powered verification: the human annotators.\n\nThe question isn't just whether your verification system meets compliance standards. It's whether you can trust the people building it. When your first line of defense could become your greatest weakness, you need a fundamentally different approach to annotation security.\n\nIn this high-stakes game of digital cat and mouse, Perle is securing not just the data, but the entire annotation ecosystem from recruitment through payment. Because in the world of KYC, you're only as strong as your weakest link.\n\n‍\n\n‍",
      "# [Perle AI](https://www.perle.ai/resources/the-unsung-heroes-of-ai-the-value-of-human-annotation-and-knowledge-in-developing-vertical-ai-agents)\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has permeated industries, reshaping how businesses operate and innovate. However, while the spotlight often shines on cutting-edge algorithms and scalable compute resources, one crucial element tends to be overlooked: human annotation and expertise. This foundation of vertical AI agents—specialized AI systems tailored for specific industries or domains—is indispensable to their success. In this blog post, we’ll explore why human annotation and domain knowledge are vital, how they drive the efficacy and impact of vertical AI agents, and the steps necessary for creating strong, accurate AI agents for critical applications like law.\n\nWhat Are Vertical AI Agents?\n\nUnlike general-purpose AI systems, vertical AI agents are designed to address the unique challenges and requirements of specific sectors, such as healthcare, finance, retail, and manufacturing. These agents are built with a deep understanding of domain-specific nuances, enabling them to deliver insights and automation tailored to the context in which they operate. Vertical AI agents are at the forefront of solving niche problems that demand precise and reliable solutions.\n\nIn many ways, vertical AI agents are the future of Software as a Service (SaaS). While traditional SaaS platforms are software tools that businesses or individuals use for various tasks, vertical AI agents go beyond simply being tools [1]. They combine advanced software capabilities with human expertise, eliminating the need for manual operations such as data entry and approval by users. In essence, vertical AI agents are more than just software: they represent a partnership between AI and human knowledge, automating workflows, enhancing accuracy, and providing deeper insights, all without the need for constant human input.\n\nThe key difference between SaaS and vertical AI agents lies in this synergy of people and software. While SaaS is essentially a software product that users operate, vertical AI agents are a seamless blend of human input and AI, where the software does the heavy lifting, and human expertise ensures that results are reliable, accurate, and aligned with real-world contexts.\n\nFor example, platforms like Giga ML [2] provide AI-powered tools that can be used to streamline various machine learning workflows. Giga ML showcases how AI solutions can be integrated with human oversight to create vertical AI agents that tackle industry-specific challenges, helping businesses develop high-performing AI models for domains such as finance, healthcare, and more. Additionally, Wendy's has implemented an AI-driven voice ordering system in their drive-thrus, enhancing customer experience and operational efficiency [3]\n\nAnother prominent example is Zest AI [4], which uses AI to help lenders make more accurate decisions by analyzing loan applicants’ data. The company’s vertical AI agent automates the underwriting process while utilizing domain-specific knowledge to make decisions that better reflect the risk profile of each applicant, demonstrating the powerful combination of human and AI expertise in financial services.\n\nThe Role of Human Annotation\n\nData Quality and Relevance: High-quality training data is the lifeblood of any AI system. For vertical AI agents, the need for accurate and contextually relevant data is even greater. Human annotators bring invaluable expertise to the table, ensuring that datasets are labeled with precision. This step is critical for domains where accuracy is vital to the effectiveness of the system.\n\nUnderstanding Nuances: In many industries, data can have subtle variations that are difficult for machines to interpret without guidance. Human annotators with specialized knowledge are needed to properly label these data points, ensuring that the AI system can make accurate decisions based on detailed insights.\n\nBuilding Trustworthy AI: Human annotation ensures that AI systems make decisions based on reliable and unbiased data. This is particularly crucial in applications like hiring or lending, where fairness and transparency are paramount.\n\nThe Importance of Domain Knowledge\n\nContextual Relevance: Domain experts help define the scope and objectives of vertical AI agents. They understand the pain points and opportunities within their fields, shaping the AI’s development to align with real-world needs. Tempus, a leader in AI-powered precision medicine, exemplifies how domain experts shape the development of vertical AI agents for healthcare. By combining AI with clinical and molecular data, Tempus is able to help physicians make better treatment decisions based on real-world, domain-specific knowledge. They have built one of the world's largest libraries of multimodal healthcare data, which includes over 250,000 patients with various types of data [5].\n\nValidation and Feedback: Domain knowledge isn’t just important during the training phase; it’s also critical for validating AI outputs. Continuous input from experts ensures the system remains accurate and evolves with changing industry dynamics.\n\nEnhancing Interpretability: For AI agents to gain user trust, they must provide explainable results. Domain experts play a key role in developing interpretable models that users can understand and act upon confidently.\n\nCreating Strong AI Agents for Critical Applications\n\nFor critical applications like law, where accuracy and reliability are paramount, it is essential to follow a robust development process to ensure the AI agents are strong, effective, and trustworthy. Below are the key steps for developing vertical AI agents in such domains, emphasizing the value of domain experts in evaluating the results:\n\nFocus on the User's Needs: Understand the specific problems that users are trying to solve and how they can be addressed with AI. For example, in legal applications, the focus may be on automating document review or providing legal insights based on complex case law. ROSS Intelligence uses AI to assist lawyers by processing vast amounts of legal data and providing relevant legal insights, showcasing the value of AI combined with domain-specific expertise in law [6].\n\nBreak Down Complex Tasks into Smaller, More Manageable Steps: Large, complex tasks need to be broken down so that AI agents can focus on solving smaller components accurately and efficiently. This approach ensures that the AI agent can perform tasks step by step without overwhelming the system or introducing errors.\n\nTest and Evaluate the AI Agent Thoroughly: Rigorous testing is crucial to identify and address any issues that may arise. Domain experts should evaluate the performance of the AI agent throughout this process, ensuring that results meet the specific needs of the application.\n\nIterate and Improve the AI Agent Over Time: AI agents must evolve to stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in technology and adapt to changes in the industry. Continuous feedback from domain experts ensures that the AI agent remains accurate and relevant, particularly in fast-evolving fields like law.\n\nChallenges and Opportunities\n\nWhile the value of human annotation and expertise is clear, integrating these elements into AI development comes with challenges:\n\nScalability: Manually annotating data can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.\n\nBias Mitigation: Annotators bring their perspectives, which can inadvertently introduce biases into the dataset.\n\nCost: Hiring domain experts can be expensive, particularly for highly specialized industries.\n\nHowever, these challenges also present opportunities. Leveraging platforms that combine human expertise with AI-assisted annotation tools can significantly accelerate the process. Additionally, fostering collaborations between academia, industry, and annotation platforms can lead to the creation of high-quality datasets at scale.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs AI continues to transform industries, the importance of human annotation and domain knowledge cannot be overstated. These elements form the backbone of vertical AI agents, ensuring they are accurate, relevant, and trustworthy. By recognizing and investing in this foundational layer, businesses and researchers can unlock the full potential of AI to tackle some of the world’s most complex challenges, especially in critical applications like law, healthcare, and finance.\n\nBy following the right steps—focusing on user needs, breaking down tasks, thoroughly testing, and continuously improving—we can create AI agents that don’t just function but excel in their specific domains, elevating industries and transforming business operations with the power of human expertise and AI working in tandem.\n\n‍\n\nReferences\n\n[1] https://zbrain.ai/vertical-ai-agents/\n\n[2] https://gigaml.com/\n\n[3] Fortune.

(Also just any general mlm book recommendations that don't strictly revolve around the romance are appreciated.)\n\n-Sincerely,\nA gay man who will go ape shit if he has to read another fujoshi manga \n\nEdit: I'm also interested in any stories, female or male MC that don't have any love interests, whether it be because the MC is aromatic or it's just a deliberate writing choice. Preferably in the same Historical-European style but modern is okay too, I just want something with good adventure, action, and plot while still actually or technically falling into LGBTQ representation.\n\n\n## Comment ID kv8sirr with +6 score by [(DegreeEquivalent1786, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShounenAi/comments/1bgcqua/looking_for_some_actually_good_historical/kv8sirr/) (in reply to ID 1bgcqua):\nWell this does involve time travel, but it does have good historical aspect from Egypt, its called \nsee you my king( fan translation, ch 73)\nThe king and me ( official translation, ch 56)\n\nIts also orginal chinese so it doesn’t have any porn and in fact is pretty fluffy and adorable (if you ignore the minor deaths scenes) it has some good world building a great plot especially when you get the time travel involved.\n\n## Comment ID kvbsqee with +3 score by [(dank-leaf, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShounenAi/comments/1bgcqua/looking_for_some_actually_good_historical/kvbsqee/) (in reply to ID 1bgcqua):\n- [Perle](https://tapas.io/series/perle) might interest you in terms of the European Historical setting!

It's a whole package; it has comedy, action, romance, and really beautiful costumes.  It revolves around the Chinese opera a lot so you get to see a lot of dramas inside one story.\n\n\\- Eternal Contract: is set in medieval Europe. It has fantasy, dragons, past lives.

All other studies have been inconclusive. It was not a head-to-head study with any drug expected to control cough, not even OTC dextromethorphan. We have better drugs for acute infection-related cough. \n\nThe study validating capsaicin as a model for antitussive testing used nebulized lidocaine as the agent to reduce cough. Which uses a similar mechanism as benzonatate, and is basically circular reasoning. Also, it’s considered a better model of subacute and chronic cough than of acute cough.

He’s underweight (born at 26 weeks) as it is so we can’t afford to let his cough keep making him puke his food up. Dimetapp Nighttime & Children’s Mucinex Cold & Flu OTC meds have always worked on his chronic coughs & colds. He will be getting his adenoids removed in 3 weeks thank God but I’m glad I didn’t just blindly follow the doctor’s advice that OTC meds don’t help. They have a sheet with dosing tables for OTC meds & that’s what I used to calculate his dose. His doctor was glad when I came back & told her these worked & at a later visit she told me she tried them when her kids got the flu & now she recommends them for pediatric coughing. We all know that the studies say honey is as effective but that wasn’t our experience & out of all that we tried, Dimetapp Nighttime & Mucinex Cold & Flu are the GOAT. All the others were useless crap, even though many shared the same ingredients. Odd. Zarbees worked ok but it is so disgusting that the taste alone will trigger a child’s gag reflex. 🤢 On an unrelated note, I’m curious how the Tussinex is with Codeine works so well to calm cough. I have covid rn & it’s a dream. Had the 1st peaceful sleep uninterrupted by coughing since I came down with this dreaded beast after taking my first dose. I know kids can’t ever have that; I’m just curious how or why it works when nothing else does.\n\n#### Comment ID itwzlaf with +1 score by [(doktorcanuck, Reddit, 2022-10-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/rv658z/whats_your_experience_with_benzonatate/itwzlaf/) (in reply to ID itwntpc):\nYou are basically just knocking yourself out with antihistamines and opioids, I bet I would also sleep well if I did that\n\n## Comment ID hr3otx5 with +64 score by [(anngrn, Reddit, 2022-01-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/rv658z/whats_your_experience_with_benzonatate/hr3otx5/) (in reply to ID rv658z):\nAs an advice nurse, I can say the usefulness is that the patient knows they are getting a prescription medication, rather than an OTC.\n\n### Comment ID hr5hdu9 with +20 score by [(outsideroutsider, Reddit, 2022-01-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/rv658z/whats_your_experience_with_benzonatate/hr5hdu9/) (in reply to ID hr3otx5):\nUnderrated comment.

This is a severe hacking cough, and as you stated, I am in recovery, and before even waiting to see if the doctor would prescribe codeine/promethazine I asked for this..it doesn't remove the cough reflex when I breathe deeply, but it stops me from constantly coughing for a few hours so long as I don't trigger myself by super deep breathing. This walk in did a chest x-ray (best walk-in I've been to), and the in office radiologist and doctor both said lungs looked normal. Used to get chronic bronchitis but haven't had it in about 7-8 years so when I asked for a zpak she said they're no longer given and bronchitis is almost always viral, and that even bacterial infections have become resistant to zpacks from over prescription. She sent me home with a prescription corticosteroid nasal spray, 40mg of Prednisone every morning, and 3x a day of benzonatate, and my Albuterol inhaler and taking Mucinex and I'm feeling better.\n\n## Comment ID hr3r2yp with +17 score by [(Farnk20, Reddit, 2022-01-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/rv658z/whats_your_experience_with_benzonatate/hr3r2yp/) (in reply to ID rv658z):\nPrimary care so seeing a ton of covid cough.

Inks that shade?  They take much longer to dry.  Inks that don't feather?  They generally take longer to dry.\n\nIf you are looking for a specific ink that is made to dry as fast as possible over the largest grade of paper - you should try Noodler's Bernanke (black or blue) or  Q'Ternity.  These are made for left handed writers and are meant to dry before you hand gets to the letter to avoid smudging - also note that the fine or extra fine nibs will help with other inks that might take longer to dry.\n\nOutside of those specific recommendations it's a trial and error game and ink samples will be your friend as you get to know your pen.\n\n### Comment ID i6p9dw2 with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-04-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/uenwac/does_the_ink_always_smear/i6p9dw2/) (in reply to ID i6p1qt7):\nThank you. For some reason I wanted to avoid the quick-drying inks because it seemed like I was going out of my way to have something different, and I wanted more normal choices. I mean, I've heard of those. I've been reading a lot about fountain pens, papers and inks. It is a little odd that it gets so particular about a certain ink+pen+paper combination. I wonder if heat and weather play a role people are overlooking, and blaming on the ink or paper instead, sometimes. Like if you're writing out in the sun or in the winter inside, and depending on your altitude. \n\nI do use fine nibs. It was fascinating that the Lamy pen (CP1) would write too broadly, I thought, with the Lamy Blue it came with, on a regular Mead writing tablet, and then when I switched to the Midori MD it was much more scratchy and fine-lined. I think the same with Perle Noire. \n\nIn my mind, although it's not appropriate for fountain pens, the Mead pad is actually much smoother to write on. So is copy paper (#20?) The Midori feels rough, like I should be using a marker or pencil. But I realize there's feathering and bleedthrough and more showthrough with the cheap paper. \n\nThe Metropolitan seems more versatile so far. Although none of these options are as versatile as my trusty Pilot Precise V5 pens I liked so much. I wish Pilot made a fancier metal version of that, of needlepoint rollerballs. Maybe Sakura does with their Microns and I haven't seen yet.\n\n#### Comment ID i6pfqd5 with +3 score by [(random-idiom, Reddit, 2022-04-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/uenwac/does_the_ink_always_smear/i6pfqd5/) (in reply to ID i6p9dw2):\nOh yeah paper is super important and will have different feel and texture with fountain pens - something you rarely notice when squishing wax on a page using a rollerball.  I love Midori Mnemosyne paper for notebooks as it's smooth, and super pen friendly, even to gusher pens like the Noodler's triple tail.\n\nHumidity and temp do factor into the situation - not as much as the ink and pen itself though - You will find that popular inks tend to get there because they tend to be reliable no matter the situation - or in a broader range of situations.  Some of the fancier inks only look fancy on \\*really nice\\* paper - and Tomoe River might produce the most impressive looking results but that paper takes forever to dry for most ink.\n\nNoodler's btw isn't all 'quick dry' - they also make some of the longest drying ink I've ever used - my experience would tell you the more an ink is raved over for color shifting, shading, sheen, or other interesting quirks the more likely it will either feather, take forever to dry, or clog often.  There is a reason the basic inks are dull.\n\nDon't feel like you are going out of your way to be different - being able to pick ink that works best for you is part of what makes this hobby practical!\n\n## Comment ID i6ofw8e with +4 score by [(fivezero_ca, Reddit, 2022-04-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/uenwac/does_the_ink_always_smear/i6ofw8e/) (in reply to ID uenwac):\nI find Perle Noire can get smear-y if it dries out a bit in the nib.

This was in response to the ongoing conflicts since Israel's establishment in 1948 and the failure of peace agreements. They identified the problem of the northern border of Israel with Syria and Lebanon, suggesting that comprehensive peace wasn't achievable any longer, and that they needed to \"transcend the Middle East\".\n\nThe proposed solution was a radical shift. The authors suggested taking out Iraq as a means to instigate an insurrection in Syria and weaken support for Lebanon. Ultimately, the goal was to defeat Hezbollah to secure Israel's northern border.\n\nNotably, the individuals behind this memo later worked in the Bush administration, worked inside the Pentagon, inside the Defense Department.\n\nThe Office of Special Plans, a Pentagon unit created by these individuals, which allegedly fabricated intelligence to support the invasion of Iraq. This office had close ties with Israel, serving as a backchannel for alarmist reports on Saddam's Iraq that even Mossad wouldn't endorse.\n\nThe connections between the Clean Break Memo authors, the Iraq War, and their influence in the Bush administration is overwhelming.\n\nHere is more information about the writers of this memo:\n\n* Douglas Feith: Douglas Jay Feith served as the under **secretary of Defense for Policy for United States president George W. Bush**, from July 2001 until August 2005. **Feith has been described as an architect of the Iraq War.** Feith was **born** to a **Jewish family** in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, one of three children of Rose and Dalck Feith. **His father was a member of the Betar, a Revisionist Zionist youth organization**, in Poland, and a Holocaust survivor who lost his parents and seven siblings in the Nazi concentration camps.\n* Richard Norman Perle: An American political advisor who served as the **Assistant Secretary of Defense for Global Strategic Affairs under President Ronald Reagan.** Perle was born in New York City, New York, **the son of Jewish parents.** He has been involved with several think-tanks, including the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, the Center for Security Policy, the American Enterprise Institute, Project for the New American Century, and **the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs.**\n* David Wurmser (born in Switzerland) is an American foreign policy specialist. He served as Middle East Adviser to former US Vice President Dick Cheney, as special assistant to John R. Bolton at the State Department and as a research fellow on the Middle East at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI). **On September 4, 2004, The Washington Post reported that FBI counterintelligence investigators had questioned Wurmser, along with Feith, Harold Rhode, and Paul Wolfowitz about the passing of classified information to Ahmad Chalabi and/or the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.**\n* Meyrav Wurmser: wrote her Ph.D. thesis on [Revisionist Zionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revisionist_Zionism) behind the [Herut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herut) and [Likud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likud) parties, and received her doctorate in political science at [George Washington University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_University) in 1998.\n\nSo you had individuals who served and worked under Bush, created an office that fabricated evidence of Saddams Iraq that was so alarmist, so extreme, that not even the Mossad was prepared to pass along to U.S intelligence. You had individuals who wrote this memo, who work in Zionist think-tanks and organizatoins. You have an individual who was investigated for espionage for passing secrets of American intelligence through AIPAC to the Israeli government.\n\nHow is this not screamed from the roof tops by every American? How is this blatant Zionist infiltration in our American government not of concern to every single American? We had American boys and men die in the Iraq war, one million Iraqis dead, because of Israel's security interests in the region?\n\n## Comment ID kcv6qd2 with +6 score by [(BobThePC, Reddit, 2023-12-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/chomsky/comments/18fhnv6/a_clean_break_memo_a_new_strategy_for_securing/kcv6qd2/) (in reply to ID 18fhnv6):\n**Why isn't every American up in arms about this?**\n**Unbelievable**!!

It is one of CERN's main objectives to keep all research at CERN open access and that also involves guided tours for the public. Of course you cannot go everywhere (to protect both yourself and the experiments and because offices are mostly quite boring) but there are a surprisingly large amount of visit points scattered around CERN, most of which typical tourists never see.\n\nTypically, single visitors come to CERN, and are able to go into the \"globe\" which has a small exhibition regarding work at CERN which is quite nice but not too big. There is also the reception with a small souvenir shop and of course, maybe most importantly, the guided tours which at the moment are roughly 90 minutes and take visitors to two visit points, the Synchrocyclotron (the first accelerator at CERN) and the atlas visitor centre (one of the detectors at the LHC).\n\nAt the moment, a new visitor centre is being built and will (hopefully) be opened in October. There apparently will be a kind of exhibition/museum inside for visitors next to the already existing globe. The building looks quite nice from the outside, I have no idea what is going on inside but am looking forward to having a look myself once everything is finished.\n\nFinally, if you manage to find a group of people who also want to visit CERN, you can ask for an official tour. That way visitors can see some of the other visit points such as at the CCC (CERN control centre). I must warn you, however, that I believe only a third to half of all visit groups who apply for a tour are actually accepted due to limited capacity and high number of requests!\n\nFeel free to comment or dm if you have any further questions!\n\nPS: Here an official link where you can also see the times at which guided tours for tourist are offered. You can register at most an hour before the tour but to be sure, you might want to get into the queue 10 minutes before that as it is on a first come first serve basis. From what I have seen there are often no more places available after 55 minutes before the tour itself. Also, I assume the weekend will be fuller than weekdays.\n\nhttps://visit.cern/individual-visitors\n\n### Comment ID jmour2v with +9 score by [(42gauge, Reddit, 2023-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/13yf6bs/is_visiting_cernor_related_museum_as_a_tourist/jmour2v/) (in reply to ID jmmjvme):\n> but there are a surprisingly large amount of visit points scattered around CERN, most of which typical tourists never see.\n\nWhy don't they?\n\n#### Comment ID jmox8u3 with +8 score by [(Pixielo, Reddit, 2023-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/13yf6bs/is_visiting_cernor_related_museum_as_a_tourist/jmox8u3/) (in reply to ID jmour2v):\nBecause it's a complete pain in the ass ushering a group of >12 unscientific humans around office blocks, and other random areas.

      "# Post ID 1b6qtwf: Roundup of all of the tea fragrances I've tried with +253 score by [(lp1571, Reddit, 2024-03-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1b6qtwf/roundup_of_all_of_the_tea_fragrances_ive_tried/)\nI've quickly found that tea is my favorite note in fragrance and have tried more scents with tea as a note than anything else so I thought I'd pull together thoughts on everything I've tried. Included stuff about me bc I found it helpful when reading similar posts but feel free to skip!\n\n***ABOUT ME***\n\n**About me (general fragrance prefs):** I tend to like fragrances that skew feminine, like florals / greens / musk / boozy, / fruit, meh on gourmands / sweet / aquatics, tend to dislike spicy / earthy. Some of my current non-tea favorite fragrances are Initio Paragon, Diptyque Fleur de Peau, Maison Crivelli Hibiscus Majahad, and Replica Coffee Break. I value longevity but projection not as much, fragrances tend not to perform super well on me but I have dry skin, spend most of my time in dry climates, and don't tend to overspray.\n\n**About me (non-fragrance):** late 20s, female, Asian-American, have lived East Coast & West Coast, work corporate, avid home chef, very outdoorsy in my hobbies but most people wouldn't guess that based on first impressions, feminine, talk very fast, strong personality.\n\n**My level of interest in the hobby:** relatively new (6-12 months) but I notoriously go all-out on my hobbies. I've worked professionally in adjacent industries (beauty & food), so have kind of transitioned knowledge & skills from both into fragrance. Tea is a passion of mine - I drink every day, only drink loose leaf, careful about my sourcing, use a fancy kettle, etc.\n\n***REVIEWS (alphabetized by house, minimum tested on skin)***\n\n**The Yulong - Armani Prive (own a FB),  10/10**\n\nThis has a soft citrus / floral opening but settles down into a very realistic green tea. There's a soft smoky quality to it that evokes dried tea leaves, not a brewed cup. To me, this smells like sticking my nose into one of the tins of nice green tea I get from China (which is a huge positive). The Yulong is what I conceptualize when I think of what a 'tea fragrance' is. Performance is strong for an EdT, I get \\~4 hours of wear with light projection and then another 1-2 hours of it as a skin scent.\n\n*Some notes since I see this get compared to Wulong Cha a lot:* I'd say The Yulong is more sophisticated, floral, and more 'tea'; Wulong Cha is brighter, much more citrus, and more green. WC has moderately better performance in both longevity and projection. WC is more of a warm weather / day time scent, the smoky / dried quality makes TY more fitting for more seasons & scenarios. They're both very unisex, TY reads ever so slightly more feminine to me.\n\n*Where I'd wear this:* to the office, on a date (though I wouldn't say this is a 'sexy' scent), a work or family evening event, at home, but really pretty much anywhere.\n\n**Figuier Eden - Armani Prive (tested), 2/10**\n\nI almost blind bought this because from the notes (tea, fig, pink pepper, iris) it seemed like my perfect fragrance. Sadly, I got a very distinct dill / pickle note from this that ruined it for me :/. In general though, I do love the Armani Prive line and find them to be well-executed so maybe if you don't get the dill note you would like this.\n\n*Where I'd wear this:* I wouldn't.\n\n**Gris Charnel EDP - BDK (sampled), 6/10**\n\nGris Charnel is very well-blended, and doesn't smell like a tea fragrance to me as I don't really pick out many of the listed notes. I would describe this as a 'cold day' scent, where it feels like wearing a cashmere sweater but there's a sharpness to it that's like walking outside when it's windy and overcast. This is a nice fragrance and I do see why it gets the hype, but it's sharper and more masculine than I typically prefer so not so much for me, though I do see myself getting through the sample. Everything I've tried from BDK has been disappointing in terms of performance, where it's a skin scent after about 30 min. The internet led me to believe this was a more feminine scent, but I'd say it's solidly unisex and very fall/winter.\n\nP.S. I find the extrait very similar, ever so slightly warmer, sweeter, and a tiny bit longer lasting but you definitely don't need both.\n\n*Where I'd wear this:* a trip to the UK, walking around in an all-black outfit, a dimly lit craft cocktail bar\n\n**Rain Tea - Chasing Scents (tested), 7/10**\n\nThis is a very photorealistic chamomile tea with honey, which I grew up drinking. I don't get any actual tea leaves from this, maaaybe a little bit of white tea. It's cozy, warm, and sweet without the honey being overpowering. This wore close to the skin on me, and I don't remember its longevity. I'd say it skews more feminine, daytime, and is all-season appropriate except maybe summer.\n\n*Where I'd wear this:* lounging at home, taking a walk with friends on the weekend, dinner at my parents or in-laws\n\n**L'Ombre des Merveilles - Hermes (tested), 8/10**\n\nThis smells very true to its notes (black tea, incense, tonka) and gives me the impression of lapsang souchang. I'd describe it as warm, sheer, smoky, and relaxing. The opening is more incense-y and the dry down more black tea, but I can smell all of the notes throughout the full lifetime of the fragrance. On me, projection is moderate but longevity is quite good (6+ hours before it turns into a skin scent). Very unisex leaning very slightly masculine, and all season / time appropriate except maybe summer daytime. I enjoy this a lot and will probably buy a FB, but am not rushing to.\n\nThis reminds me a lot of Dear Polly in the dry down - both are warm, sheer black tea scents, but the fruitiness and musk in DP makes it more uplifting, feminine, and intimate vs. the smokiness in L'OdM reads more masculine and nighttime.\n\n*Where I'd wear this:* work event, dinner with friends, to feel warm in the winter with my favorite sweater\n\n**Unknown Pleasures - Kerosene (tested), 7.5/10** \n\nI originally discounted this because it opens with a super strong lemon that's a bit cleaner-y, but sniffed my wrist a few hours later and loved it. To me, this smells like oolong tea leaves after you steep them (somewhere in between leaves and a brewed cup). I associate this with Taiwanese oolongs which can often have a creamy, milky quality to them which I think is from the waffle cone accord. I do not think this is very reminiscent of earl grey, as I do not get either bergamot or black tea. This is probably the safest blind buy of all of the Kerosene fragrances I've tried, and I see why it's their best seller (will probably get my own bottle in the near future). As with many Kerosene fragrances, it's not really possible to ascribe to any gender, and the longevity is quite strong (could smell 6+ hours later).\n\nWhere I'd wear this: to a coffee shop, reading a good book, meeting a friend for lunch\n\n**The Matcha - Le Labo (sampled), 7/10 overall scent, 2/10 tea scent.**\n\nI can't pick out tea at all in this, and definitely not matcha. I get green fig, a creamy coconut / lactonic accord, and some herbaceous notes that I suppose could be slightly tea-like. For me, this feels like a fragrance that tried to capture all of the 'components' of matcha (green, creamy, earthy) but failed to actually make it smell like matcha. It is a nice unisex fig fragrance, more office-y and all-season for me than Philosykos or Debaser, but not a wow for me.\n\n*Where I'd wear this:* can't think of anywhere this would be particularly appropriate or inappropriate\n\n**The Noir - Le Labo (tried), 4/10**\n\nSimilar to The Matcha, I think Le Labo went for all of the components or facets of black tea but ended up with something that didn't actually smell like black tea. It's very smoky, incense-y, and tobacco-y to me with some woods in the background. I do not get any of the fig / bergamot top notes. Very masculine, and I'd still prefer this as a candle vs. on a man.\n\n*Where I'd wear this:* not for me\n\n**Matcha Meditation - Maison Margiela Replica (tested), 5/10**\n\nThis is more interesting & non-linear than a lot of the other MMR fragrances, but also IMO not as good. I get a citrus-y and floral opening that's quite pleasant although not very matcha-reminiscent. The problem for me is that for most of the middle of its life, I get very screechy jasmine/white floral + matcha (coming from someone who loves jasmine) that I could definitely see being headache-inducing. The matcha here does smell more realistic & noticeable to me than in most other fragrances I've tried with that accord. The drydown is a simple but nice white chocolate and musk that's sweet but not overly so. Feminine, reminds me of spring, and longevity was better than a lot of MMR EdTs. I won't be sampling or buying this.\n\n*Where I'd wear this:* a walk outside in the spring, maybe at home alone, not in any enclosed spaces with other people\n\n**Indigo - Nest (tested), 8/10**\n\nThis is a dark, juicy, fruity fragrance that smells like drinking a, cup of black tea with blackberry juice. I get the fruity + some woody components more than I get the tea, but it's a beautiful fragrance nonetheless. The fruit is realistic, with an almost sticky quality but not overly sweet, like the smell of crushed berries. The listed notes say cardamom, which is the one thing I can't really smell as there is no spicy quality to my nose. Some similarities to Dear Polly, but this is juicier, darker, and I smell the tea less. For the price it's excellent - the dark fruit is very addictive, and while it's not extremely complex it doesn't feel generic as I don't see as many designer/mass market fragrances with this scent profile. Definitely a feminine fragrance, don't recall the performance so probably not great and not terrible, and all-season appropriate except maybe summer day time. I will likely get a FB of this during the next Sephora sale.\n\n*Where I'd wear this:* going out in the summer or fall, on a date, office-appropriate in colder climates\n\n**Wulong Cha - Nishane (own a FB), 9.5/10**\n\n​This was the first niche bottle I bought, and I absolutely love it. It’s a bright, citrusy, green, herbaceous scent which lasts longer than any other citrus I’ve tried. This definitely reminds me more of a brewed cup of lemon green tea or iced green tea, as opposed to leaves, although I can smell the tea leaves a bit more in the dry down. I find this to be more of a citrus/green fragrance than a tea fragrance, very summery, and very unisex with no lean feminine or masculine. I get around \\~2 hours of moderate projection, and about 6 hours total of wear before it turns into a skin scent which is quite good for me for this scent profile. \n\n*Where I'd wear this:* out on a summer night, vacation, if I needed an energy boost, shopping at a farmer's market, also office-friendly.\n\n**Dear Polly - Vilhelm (sampled), 9/10**\n\nThis is a beautiful creamy sweet black tea scent, reminiscent of my best friend's favorite cup of black tea with milk and sugar. I don't agree with the accords listed on Fragrantica as it's neither citrusy nor green to my nose, but I do smell the green apple in the beginning (part of the sweetness). In the drydown, the sweetness fades and I can smell the musk more clearly. I think this fragrance matches perfectly with the inspiration (love letter to his wife), as it feels very intimate to me. I'd say it's more feminine, but a man could certainly wear it. Vilhelm has generally poor performance (with some outliers) on my skin, but I'd say this is a lightly projecting scent with moderate longevity. I will be buying a FB of this in the near future.\n\n*Where I'd wear this:* a cute date night, dinner with friends, hanging out at home, appropriate for most situations\n\n*Edited:* some tea fragrances I haven’t tried yet but are on my list are listed below, would appreciate thoughts on these + relating them to any I have tried above!\n\n- Indigo Smoke (Arquiste)\n- L’eau 2017 (Carolina Herrera)\n- Winter Palace, Inle, and Eau de Memo (Memo)\n- Tea Service (Chasing Scents)\n- Molecule 01 + Black Tea (Escentric Molecules)\n- African Rooibos (Chris Collins)\n- Remember Me (Jovoy)\n- Bamboo Harmony (Kilian)\n- 1900 L’Heure de Proust (Les Bains Guerbois)\n- Five O’Clock Au Gingembre (Serge Lutens)\n\n## Comment ID ktdo2wu with +27 score by [(hauteburrrito, Reddit, 2024-03-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1b6qtwf/roundup_of_all_of_the_tea_fragrances_ive_tried/ktdo2wu/) (in reply to ID 1b6qtwf):\nAh, what a gorgeous post!

It’s been about 9 months since I last smelled it though so I need to try it again and pay attention since I discounted it after the lemon opening. \n\nWinter Palace has been on my sample list but it’s been hard for me to get a hold of it! To be honest the fragrances I’ve tried so far from Memo have been a little disappointing in both scent and performance (performance especially), how do you find the performance on Winter Palace?\n\n## Comment ID kte12tz with +6 score by [(Aggravating_Diet_704, Reddit, 2024-03-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1b6qtwf/roundup_of_all_of_the_tea_fragrances_ive_tried/kte12tz/) (in reply to ID 1b6qtwf):\nI love tea scents so I loved this post!

Perfumes smell very different on my sibling vs me, and we look a lot alike. \n\nWulong Cha can definitely be finicky! I fell in love when I sniffed it on a hot, humid summer day on skin. Even now, I much prefer it on skin to clothing so usually spray when I’m bare armed. I think the warmth / musk of skin really helps it feel like a fragrance, otherwise because it is quite strong for a citrus freshie I could see it skewing in the direction of lemon cleaner or generic spa.\n\n## Comment ID kte756a with +4 score by [(pocketfulofcharm, Reddit, 2024-03-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1b6qtwf/roundup_of_all_of_the_tea_fragrances_ive_tried/kte756a/) (in reply to ID 1b6qtwf):\nI have Indigo Smoke, Winter Palace, and Molecule 01 + Black Tea.

Indigo Smoke is very smokey, and combined with the sweetness from the apricot note it makes me think of barbecue sauce, but after those top notes fade a little it is kind of woodsy and slightly pine-y and doesn't smell especially like tea but I think the tea notes help smooth things out. Winter Palace reminded me a bit of Indigo Smoke but without the pine and smoke. It has some soft fruity smells to it and some warm spices and is a little more tea forward. Five O'Clock Au Gingembre is a very good ginger scent and smells like a bright warm autumn day to me, but again I don't get a lot of tea from it. I may just not get what tea smells like in perfumery.\n\n### Comment ID ktexzbb with +2 score by [(lp1571, Reddit, 2024-03-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1b6qtwf/roundup_of_all_of_the_tea_fragrances_ive_tried/ktexzbb/) (in reply to ID ktdyzdt):\nOh no, the barbecue sauce comment scares me because I’m scarred from someone telling me that Xerjoff Golden Dallah which I find spicy/sweet smelled like breakfast sausage on me :(\n\nYour reviews of Winter Palace and Five O’Clock Au Gingembre sound promising though!

Tea is a passion of mine as well, so I am excited to delve into tea perfumes. Chasing Scents is next on my list to try.  \n\nI’ve only tried two tea-centric perfumes: Wulong Cha and Thé Matcha. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with both. I think I don’t like the smell of fig, as it makes perfumes “feel” waxy to me. The figginess was particularly noticeable in The Matcha, and I couldn’t get past it.  \n\nI’m in the vast minority, but I also didn’t like Wulong Cha. It had a bitterness to it. As it dried down, the smell reminded me of sipping out of a cold, oversteeped cup of green tea I’d forgotten about a few hours ago. Also, for reasons I don’t understand, it smelled specifically like a hotel lobby to me. I was getting “air freshener” instead of perfume. Maybe because of that association, and maybe because of the fig, it felt almost unclean, like I had waited in the lobby until housekeeping finished up and then immediately rolled around on the carpet. I have no idea why my brain is going there, haha, but I wasn’t able to turn it around! \n\nSince green teas don’t seem to be my vibe, I’m looking forward to trying some black tea scents! I LOVE the smell of dried black tea and think I’d be happy to smell like that all the time.\n\n### Comment ID ktf52nt with +2 score by [(lp1571, Reddit, 2024-03-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1b6qtwf/roundup_of_all_of_the_tea_fragrances_ive_tried/ktf52nt/) (in reply to ID ktern1w):\nI totally get what you mean with the fig, it’s a very polarizing note. The Mstcha is VERY figgy as well, and I feel the fig isn’t as balanced out by other accords as in some other fig forward fragrances. \n\nTry The Yulong before you give up on green tea! It’s more refined than Wulong Cha and doesn’t have the same loud citrusiness that could definitely veer into cleaner. \n\nOf this list, L’Ombre des Merveilles smells the most like black tea leaves to me! I’d also give Dear Polly a shot.\n\n#### Comment ID ktkaw0f with +2 score by [(LowerRoyal7, Reddit, 2024-03-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1b6qtwf/roundup_of_all_of_the_tea_fragrances_ive_tried/ktkaw0f/) (in reply to ID ktf52nt):\nThanks for these insights! I’ll add these to my sample wish list. I also tried molecule 01 + ginger from escentric molecules recently and was blown away by the realistic ginger scent.

I find Venenum to be kind of the opposite of Gris in some ways, though—like, if Gris Charnel is a cold, rainy day, Venenum is more like a dry heat. If Gris is dusky purple, Venenum is pale yellow.

Since you describe yourself as having a strong personality, I wanted to suggest *Parfums Vintage - Imbue* to you. It's a clone of the discontinued *Gucci pour Homme II* and praised as a very accurate dupe with superior longevity. Sadly, I haven't been able to verify the simlarity (yet). Definitely not a photorealistic tea scent and definitely unisex.   \n  \nThe black tea is nonetheless at its heart and there's a spice accord wrapped around it which, to my nose, evokes a juicy cherry, although cherry isn't listed in the scent profile. It also sports that soothing and calming property which tea frags generally veer towards.\n\n  \nIt's become my go to daily because of how it balances a character that naturally takes up space, it makes you approachable and likable. I'm sure you'll easily be able to research Imbue yourself, so I'll leave it at that.\n\nTake care!\n\n### Comment ID ktkp3kw with +1 score by [(lp1571, Reddit, 2024-03-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1b6qtwf/roundup_of_all_of_the_tea_fragrances_ive_tried/ktkp3kw/) (in reply to ID kti5doc):\nThis sounds super interesting!

IMO it was way better than Part 2 (which, while I still liked it a lot, was sort of patchy and had some jarring tonal shifts before ultimately being bailed out by a really fantastic ending), and probably better than Part 1 on the grounds that it's an actual complete season rather than half a season. Part 3 feels like it stands on its own better, and I would say the pacing and plotting was the strongest it's ever been.\n\nAnother nice thing was that the supporting characters, most notably Claire and Guédira, moved beyond being caricatures (\"wife\", \"geeky cop\") and got actual personalities of their own.\n\nI also felt that the technical work was better -- admittedly Parts 1 & 2 were shot during the height of the pandemic and Part 2 seems to have been somewhat rush-released to capitalize on the success of Part 1, but those weird continuity errors that kept popping up in Part 2 in particular aren't present here.\n\nThat's not to say it's totally without criticism: the ending was a little anticlimactic although it does set up another season well, and I think Assane himself comes across as somewhat less likable this time around (the scenes with Claire and Raoul where he's pretending to be the coach were very sweet, but let's be honest, betraying Benjamin like that was a massive bruh moment).\n\nAlso guys, seriously, by now if you've watched this far, you should really know that this series isn't realistic in the slightest and isn't meant to be, either.\n\n### Comment ID k3w9in7 with +6 score by [(JohannasGarden, Reddit, 2023-10-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/lupinNetflix/comments/170tb9r/lupin_season_3_discussion/k3w9in7/) (in reply to ID k3ph9bi):\nParticularly Claire.

He is by far the most innocent, kind and loyal person in the entire show and this season the writers decided he was going to suffer and he made me sad. Also Claire tricked him into telling her assane is alive and that was so sad too. But I'm confused as to why he has scars and cuts on his face when he's in prison after the interrogation. Like at some point his face is just randomly completely beat up. Did I miss a scene or something?\nAlso I really hoped assane would apologize, explain himself and shit. I thought there would be a heartbreaking reunion scene where everyone cries and he begs for forgiveness but no he just sent him a fucking steak. A FUCKING STEAK!! HE EXPECTS HIM TO FORGIVE HIM FOR HORRIBLY BETRAYING HIM AND SENDING HIM TO JAIL BY GIVING HIM A STEAK AND THE WORST PART IS HE DOES!  he's not mad at him for a single second. It's like repeatedly beating your dog and after all of that he still trusts you and comes back to you like wtf. By the end of the season I had no empathy for assane anymore. He even pretended he was his son's basketball coach and let his wife catch feelings for him again, making her believe she could move on and then NOPE! Surprise motherfuckers it's me!

Je trouve que c'est une bonne example de continuité, car il avait failli tuer Pellegrini quand il parlaient de Babakar.\n\nEn plus, quand on parle du trahison de Ben;  \n1) Assane n'avait pas le choix, Ben DEVAIT aller en prison, sinon il tueraient sa mère. Et vu qu'on découvre un peux plus tard que Keller n'allait jamais la rendre à Assane, et allait la tuer quoi qu'Assane aurait fait, envoyer Ben en prison était le seul choix. En plus, je crois que Ben n'était pas faché, car il ne faisaient pas un vol tout court, mais un vol pour sauver sa mère. Allors Ben avait compris que c'était Keller qui l'a demandé de le faire. En plus, je crois qu'il savait qu'Assane trouverait une manière de le sortir du prison.

These aren't crucial crucial characters but their absence was felt by me.\n\nGripes:\nKeller knowing Assane was still alive somehow? Youssef going from \"Leave Assane alone\" in s2 to \"I need to arrest him\" again was certainly a shift I didn't enjoy. Assane betraying Ben and then it hardly being mentioned because he got him steak and fries? Assane breaking character and doing the bottle flip thing in a fridge that isn't his so Claire can know his identity but then he's surprised. Sofia going back to not believing a word Youssef says when he's literally proven himself in s1 s2. Assane's mom just happens to be a great thief herself. Claire switching gears the moment Assane is ack in her life. Raoul having no character outside of being bullied in basketball and saying his dad is alive. Almost 0 mention of the events that occured last season outside everyone saying Assane is a master thief. More that probably aren't coming to mind. \n\nI just felt like this season had to have an arbitrary reason for Assane to do more crimes when he was only really doing everything to get justice for his father in the first 2 seasons. \n\nWith 1 and 2 there was a clear push and pull between the Lupin crew and the Pellegrini crew. Season 3 kind of just introduced more people out of nowhere to stir conflict. Now I don't think season 2 was the perfect ending by all means but I actually do think it could have stopped there? This felt like the sequel to a film that reached it's climax. Jean-Luc, Bruno, and the entire fight club wasn't a thought in season 1 and 2 and it really shows.\n\nI had fun with it, truly but I think I'm even more sour with the cliffhanger push for a 4th season when again, they could have resolved everything then and there in season 1 and 2. There was no cliffhanger or anything when that story ended, but after we wrapped up everything in season 3 let's introduce a random problem that was never suggested. How could anyone betray Assane when they were all literally about to leave town, there would be no way to plan for him to turn himself in Claire JUST found out. Driving me crazy.\n\n### Comment ID k675mqu with +1 score by [(Policeman5151, Reddit, 2023-10-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/lupinNetflix/comments/170tb9r/lupin_season_3_discussion/k675mqu/) (in reply to ID k5t08xd):\nSteak frites, I guess all is forgiven /s\n\n### Comment ID khjx7vf with +1 score by [(jungkookadobie, Reddit, 2024-01-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/lupinNetflix/comments/170tb9r/lupin_season_3_discussion/khjx7vf/) (in reply to ID k5t08xd):\nAgree\n\n## Comment ID k3mvggb with +5 score by [(ImaginaryEffort4409, Reddit, 2023-10-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/lupinNetflix/comments/170tb9r/lupin_season_3_discussion/k3mvggb/) (in reply to ID 170tb9r):\nmerciful squeeze chunky gaze rich bedroom include spark bow money\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n\n### Comment ID k3nm616 with +2 score by [(lMystic, Reddit, 2023-10-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/lupinNetflix/comments/170tb9r/lupin_season_3_discussion/k3nm616/) (in reply to ID k3mvggb):\nFor real.

Nobody saw Assane grabbing the Pearl from the cctv camera? Why would such a high level criminal be in a police vehicle with no escort following it? Since the first few episodes it started going off. Assane’s “death”, at the morgue scene, they told Guedira that Assane’s lungs were all damaged yet he never tried to open the sheet beyond his chest to confirm. To me the made Assane get away in some scenes in some unrealistic ways.

After holding her hands and hugging her, his expression shifts, hinting at a realization. It seems Assane might have already figured out that Mariama isn’t his real mom but chooses to play along.\n\nHe likely holds off addressing this because his priority is to deal with Keller’s schemes. \n\nAdditionally, Mariama may have influenced or encouraged Assane’s decision to turn himself in. It’s possible that Assane suspects Mariama is part of a larger conspiracy, and by cooperating, he aims to uncover who else might be controlling her or who is behind her. This interpretation suggests that Assane is always thinking several steps ahead, waiting for the right moment to reveal the truth.\n\n## Comment ID m7wgb13 with +1 score by [(Lucky-Weight8718, Reddit, 2025-01-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/lupinNetflix/comments/170tb9r/lupin_season_3_discussion/m7wgb13/) (in reply to ID 170tb9r):\nBoa noite, tenho algumas perguntas e queria saber oque passa pela cabeça de vocês...  \nSobre o final que mostra a carta que Diop recebeu, se Keller foi preso só por causa da tentativa de matar, onde anda Juliette oque ela poderia está fazendo nessa temporada, além de dumont que foi preso junto com hubert e como foi a vida do Beijamim na cadeia pois em varias cenas ele apanhou em brigas possivelmente homens ligados ao Pellegrini.\n\n## Comment ID k4bcdic with +1 score by [(Micronlance, Reddit, 2023-10-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/lupinNetflix/comments/170tb9r/lupin_season_3_discussion/k4bcdic/) (in reply to ID 170tb9r):\nLupin left his own funeral at the same time as the people who came to mourn him yet NOBODY CLOCKED HIM?\n\n### Comment ID ke4t1b2 with +1 score by [(Esoteric716, Reddit, 2023-12-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/lupinNetflix/comments/170tb9r/lupin_season_3_discussion/ke4t1b2/) (in reply to ID k4bcdic):\nI think those were just random people.

Why didn’t they at least put in oxygen canisters? Why didn’t the mourge attendants who dressed his body or put him in not notice he wasn’t dead?  Why couldn’t everyone see his chest rising from breathing in the mourge when he was examined by the doctors? \n\nBut I actually stopped watching when he handed over a priceless pearl based on a phone call with his assumed mother, who, assuming it wasn’t a con, is a total deadbeat who, based on the info at that point in the season, made no effort to contact him in 30 years after getting out of prison.

Firstly, all I want to say is how the writing is just unbelievable to make sense with what’s happening and makes Asane’s escape plans unrealistic IMO. Secondly, the current episode that I watched I hated the fact that Asane EASILY betrayed his own friend, Benjamin for his own personal reasons for saving his mom and instead of being more upfront he basically made his friend reveal himself to the police staff in order for his plan to work and at that mansion where them both were supposedly had to steal the real jewelry bracelet from the woman’s wrist Benjamin got busted and went to jail?!. Third of all, Why is nobody  ( the public crowd in this season) actually paying attention more vividly to Asane’s  many fake disguises? Tbh part 2 wrapped up the story and felt completed unlike this current one which is so lazy and the storyline just doesn’t pull me enough to engage in bc it feels like a filler season 🤷🏽‍♀️\n\n## Comment ID k7f7ml3 with +1 score by [(CarpenterIntrepid593, Reddit, 2023-11-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/lupinNetflix/comments/170tb9r/lupin_season_3_discussion/k7f7ml3/) (in reply to ID 170tb9r):\nI just finished the episode 4…Assane is a selfish asshole, I’m very angry😡 How can he did it with Ben?

At that point he doesn't have the phone yet so he clearly hasn't been in contact with Assane since the night of his arrest. So it's just as well he'd be able to act like he's been totally betrayed and caught. If he were betrayed he could have just as easily not sent the drone from the maze with the bracelet thing.\n\n### Comment ID kfdentp with +1 score by [(eyezonlyii, Reddit, 2023-12-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/lupinNetflix/comments/170tb9r/lupin_season_3_discussion/kfdentp/) (in reply to ID kay2sr3):\nComing in late, but we just finished it too.

      "# [KIVA AI Rebrands to Perle, Bringing Human Wisdom to AI Models for Companies of All Sizes on 2025-02-19](https://www.fintechnews.org/kiva-ai-rebrands-to-perle-bringing-human-wisdom-to-ai-models-for-companies-of-all-sizes/)\nPerle Makes it Simple to Train High-Quality AI Models With Modular, Expert-Powered Training Data Solutions, Allowing Customers to Focus on Innovation, Not Data Management\n\nSAN FRANCISCO–(BUSINESS WIRE)–KIVA AI today announced that it has rebranded as Perle, to deliver modular training data solutions that bring human wisdom to AI models. Perle takes the heavy lifting out of training and fine-tuning complex multi-modal AI models, giving customers powerful tools for everything from defining project requirements, RLHF, and expert human data tagging, to data enrichment, cleaning, and defending against adversarial attacks. By delivering actionable insights and intelligence guided by an expert-in-the-loop, Perle allows customers to focus on accelerating innovation. Learn more about Perle or request a demo at www.perle.ai.\n\nPerle’s first training solution is available now and delivers expert human data annotation via a vetted global network of domain experts spanning industries as diverse as STEM, Legal, and Linguistics. The company will also release an innovative AI project scoping feature in the coming weeks that directly addresses challenges with defining annotation project scope and guidelines in order to create custom optimized workflows. Additional offerings will roll out in the coming months.\n\nMany AI teams spend the majority of their time and resources on undifferentiated data management rather than model development. Companies can spend up to 80 percent of their development resources on data labeling, discovery, quality checks, compliance, versioning, bias auditing, drift detection, and more. Teams often are also forced to choose between expensive one-size-fits-all platforms they don’t need, or wrestle with a patchwork of services from different sources. Perle solves these challenges with a modular training data solution that helps companies choose the right mix of services to bring higher-quality AI models to market faster, and transform their organizations to focus on innovation over administration.\n\n“Perle is designed to help companies of all shapes and sizes extract ‘Perles of Wisdom’ from their data and accelerate innovation with their AI model development with our expert-in-the-loop solutions,” said Ahmed Rashad, Founder and CEO of Perle. “We’re obsessed with making it easy for customers to innovate by taking the heavy lifting of data management off their plates, and empowering them to choose the solutions they need to build better models faster and more efficiently.”\n\nFounded by a team of AI veterans from companies and institutions including Scale, Amazon, Meta, MIT, Harvard, UC Berkeley, and Columbia, the company raised $8.5 million in pre-seed funding in October 2024.\n\n###\n\nAbout Perle\n\nPerle brings human wisdom to artificial intelligence with expert-powered modular training data solutions that take the heavy lifting out of training complex multi-modal AI models.

      "# [Perle Console Server Replacement Options by ZPE Systems on 2024-10-03](https://zpesystems.com/perle-console-server-replacement-options-zs/)\nPerle offers two console server solutions for out-of-band (OOB) management of data center infrastructure: the IOLAN SCG and the IOLAN SCR. The SCG is available in both fixed and modular form factors, while the SCR comes in four models with different combinations of 56 managed ports, allowing companies to choose the OOB management hardware that best suits their environment. Unfortunately, IOLAN solutions suffer from hardware and software limitations that can curb scalability and limit agility. This guide discusses Perle console server replacement options that enable streamlined growth through automation capabilities and vendor freedom.\n\nKey takeaways\n\nPerle IOLAN SCG appliances offer out-of-band console server management for up to 48 devices in a fixed or modular form factor. Perle IOLAN SCR console servers come with four different managed port configurations for added flexibility.\n\nPerle console servers offer some automation capabilities, like auto-discovery and zero-touch provisioning, as well as comprehensive firewall functionality. However, their underpowered hardware and closed management software prevent Guest OS hosting or third-party infrastructure automation and orchestration.\n\nThe Nodegrid platform from ZPE Systems overcomes these limitations with robust CPU, RAM, and storage, as well as vendor-neutral software. It enables data center scalability by providing high-density serial port configurations and supporting 3rd-party automation.\n\nNodegrid can also run networking, security, edge computing, AIOps, and more, consolidating the data center tech stack and improving operational efficiency.\n\nPerle IOLAN console server overview\n\nPerle IOLAN SCG console servers provide out-of-band management for up to 48 infrastructure devices. Fixed-form-factor models use copper Ethernet for networking and OOB, while the modular version has options for Wi-Fi, cellular, and dial-up. The modular series also has three expansion bays that support any combination of 16-port RS-232 or USB serial modules.\n\nPerle IOLAN SCR console servers come in four different models with up to 56 managed serial, USB, and Ethernet ports, as well as optional cellular integration.\n\nClick here to compare Perle console server tech specs.\n\nPerle console servers have automatic LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol) discovery and can extend zero-touch provisioning (ZTP) to end-devices. They come with an embedded firewall, OpenVPN and IPSec VPN, and AES encryption. The PerleVIEW cloud-based management software provides centralized monitoring and control of all connected data center infrastructure.\n\nWhy consider Perle console server alternatives\n\nIOLAN console servers have an underpowered 500 MHz core 32-bit ARM processor, 4GB of flash storage, and 1GB RAM. This hardware may be sufficient for basic infrastructure management workflows and ZTP, but it prevents Guest OS hosting and more advanced automation. The Perle platform also doesn’t integrate with any third-party automation or orchestration solutions.\n\nAn inability to fully automate infrastructure management workflows – or to orchestrate those tasks that can be automated – ultimately limits operational efficiency and data center scalability. Consequently, IT teams can’t effectively support the needs of the growing business, adapt to strategy changes, or focus on revenue-driving innovations like artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML).\n\nWhat’s needed is an open platform that can manage any device, automate any workflow, and work with third-party software to provide a fully integrated infrastructure orchestration experience.\n\nPerle console server replacement options from ZPE Systems\n\nNodegrid is a family of vendor-neutral console server solutions from ZPE Systems. It comes in four models:\n\nThe Nodegrid Serial Console Plus (NSCP) is a robust platform offering up to 96 managed serial ports in a 1U rack-mounted form factor for hyperscale data centers and cloud service providers.\n\nThe Nodegrid Serial Console S Series provides up to 48 auto-sensing ports to unify management of legacy, modern, and multi-vendor data center environments.\n\nThe Nodegrid Net Services Router (NSR) is a modular solution that can be customized with a range of serial, networking, storage, and compute cards to adapt to any use case.\n\nThe Nodegrid Serial Console Plus Core Edition (NSCP-CE) is ideal for break-fix deployments while providing more robust security capabilities than comparable solutions.\n\nNodegrid devices come with Intel x86-32 bit processors, robust (and upgradable) internal storage and RAM options, and a Linux-based Nodegrid OS. The NSCP, S Series, and NSR support Guest OS and Docker containers for third-party applications. That means they can directly host infrastructure automation and orchestration (like Ansible, Puppet, and Chef), security (like Palo Alto’s next-generation firewalls), and much more. Plus, it can extend this automation to legacy and mixed-vendor devices that otherwise wouldn’t support it.\n\nAll Nodegrid models can use a wide range of USB environmental monitoring sensors to help remote teams maintain optimal conditions in the data center. Nodegrid hardware protects the control plane with advanced security features like BIOS protection, UEFI Secure Boot, self-encrypted disk (SED), Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0, and a multi-site VPN using IPSec, WireGuard, and OpenSSL protocols. The Nodegrid OS and the ZPE Cloud management software are also Synopsys-validated as achieving industry-leading security.\n\nWhich Nodegrid serial console is right for you?",
      "# [Socialite, Hostess, Philanthropist by The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica on 1999-07-01](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Perle-Mesta)\nPerle Mesta (born Oct. 12, 1889, Sturgis, Mich., U.S.—died March 16, 1975, Oklahoma City, Okla.) was an American socialite and diplomat who entertained the world’s business and political elite from the 1930s through the ’50s and who also served as the first U.S. minister to Luxembourg.\n\nPerle Skirvin grew up in an affluent family in Oklahoma City and was educated privately. In 1917 she married George Mesta, a wealthy Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, manufacturer. While he was working in Washington, D.C., during World War I, she had her first introduction to politics and Washington society. After the war the Mestas traveled extensively in Europe, and by the time of her husband’s death in 1925 Perle Mesta had a large acquaintanceship in the worlds of business and politics.\n\nIn 1929 Mesta settled in Newport, Rhode Island, where she soon became a leading hostess. About 1935 she began to devote much time to active political work. She joined the National Woman’s Party and became an effective lobbyist on behalf of the Equal Rights Amendment; she was also chairman of the party’s public relations committee for a time. In electoral politics Mesta supported the Republican Party until 1940 and the Democratic Party thereafter. About 1940 she moved her residence to Washington, D.C., and soon became one of the capital’s foremost hostesses. She was an early patron of Senator Harry S. Truman and was greatly helpful to him in the elections of 1944 and, especially, 1948, when she served on the finance committee of the Democratic campaign. In 1949 Mesta became U.S. minister to Luxembourg. She was the first to hold the post, diplomatic relations with the duchy having previously been handled by the ambassador to Belgium. She served in the post until 1953.",
      "# [The Difference Between Tapioca Pearls & Popping Fruit Boba by Nina Judy B on 2024-04-29](https://inspirefoodcompany.com/it/blogs/news/tapioca-pearls-vs-popping-boba)\nA lot of people still confuse popping boba and tapioca pearls when it comes to bubble tea ingredients. The Inspire Food Company is Europe’s leading importer of both ingredients and would like to educate customers about the differences and characteristics.\n\nTapioca Pearls\n\nTapioca boba pearls are small balls made of tapioca starch (cassava root) which is cooked with sugar or honey for color and flavor. They are usually dark brown or black in color and chewy in texture. Similar to gummy bears.\n\nThese tapioca pearls are commonly and mostly found in milk based bubble teas and other dessert creations such as ice cream or pancake topping.\n\nThe Inspire Food Company offers Tapioca pearls in 1kg and 3kg size.\n\nPopping Boba Pearls\n\nPopping fruit boba are little spheres made of sodium alginate and provide a different culinary experience in the mouth.\n\nThese bursting bobas are created by a process known as spherification. The thin skin holds fruit juice inside and by bursting the skin the mouth, the inside liquid is released. Just like a tiny flavor explosion, a truly unique experience.\n\nPopping boba is very popular for fruity bubble tea, ice cream toppings and frozen yoghurt.\n\nThe Inspire Food Company has popping boba available in sizes starting at 100g cups up to 3.2kg commercial size buckets.\n\nOur custom recipe does not contain sucralose and is 100% vegan and gluten free.",

      "# [FIRE joins animal advocates, free speech groups urging Ninth Circuit to affirm ruling that allows undercover audio recording on 2024-04-24](https://www.thefire.org/news/fire-joins-animal-advocates-free-speech-groups-urging-ninth-circuit-affirm-ruling-allows)\nSAN FRANCISCO, Calif., April 24, 2024 — Last night, lawyers from the Animal Activist Legal Defense Project filed a friend-of-the-court (“amicus”) brief on behalf of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, Animal Outlook, constitutional law professors, and the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression in support of a federal court ruling that struck down an Oregon law requiring consent by all parties to an audio recording—even in public places, where there is no reasonable expectation of privacy.\n\nThe full U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit will reconsider the ruling, issued by a three-judge appellate panel, which held Oregon’s requirement violated the First Amendment in Project Veritas v. Schmidt. For decades, journalists, undercover investigators, and animal rights activists — including PETA and Animal Outlook — have used audiovisual recordings to expose corruption, crime, and violence against animals in agricultural facilities and elsewhere.\n\nREAD THE FULL BRIEF\n\n“The modern-day Upton Sinclair would not conduct his landmark investigation into Chicago’s meatpacking plants relying solely on his written notes, based on memory, and transcribing them into a book,” said Chris Carraway, Staff Attorney at the Animal Activist Legal Defense Project, referring to Sinclair’s groundbreaking work, The Jungle. “He would instead create audiovisual recordings and distribute them across the Internet for mass consumption. Oregon’s statute prohibits many modern examples in which audiovisual recordings have contributed greatly to issues of public concern.”\n\nOregon’s statute permits an individual to secretly observe conversations and republish those statements in writing, as well as to surreptitiously film an individual, without capturing audio. However, it draws the line at recording conversations — through audio, or a combination of audio and video — a distinction that the amicus parties say is arbitrary and violates the First Amendment.\n\nNumerous surreptitious audiovisual recordings by PETA, Animal Outlook, and other animal rights advocates have documented horrific treatment of animals in agriculture, experimentation, and other industries that use and abuse animals.\n\nDescribing the impact of those investigations, Cheryl Leahy, Executive Director of Animal Outlook, said, “One can certainly conceptualize the pain of an animal from a written description or silent video. But when one hears an animal’s cries, the listener feels that pain in a completely different, and much more impactful, manner.”\n\nAnimal rights advocates sue after facing ongoing censorship and arrest for peaceful advocacy in Houston public park\n\nPress Release\n\nOne advocate was arrested and handcuffed for two hours after peacefully demonstrating in a public park. FIRE is suing to protect the constitutional right to speak freely in public parks.\n\nRead More\n\n“The federal court ruled that Oregon’s law was an impermissible restriction on free speech, and we fully expect the court to uphold this ruling,” says PETA Foundation Managing General Counsel Jared Goodman. “All Oregonians have a First Amendment right to expose criminal wrongdoing, including cruelty to animals. Animal rights defenders, including PETA, will continue to use every legal means at their disposal, from whistleblower reports to undercover investigations, to expose the horrors that occur behind closed doors in laboratories, slaughterhouses, puppy mills, and other abusive facilities.”\n\n“Oregon has drawn its own line determining how journalists and others can record when uncovering the truth — and that line runs headlong into the First Amendment,” said Gabe Walters, FIRE attorney. “Recordings can be essential for newsgathering on issues that matter most to the public, but wrongdoers have a funny habit of straightening up when they know they’re being recorded. Today, FIRE is proud to fight alongside a broad coalition of advocates to protect this important right to expose what’s wrong.”\n\nThese days, notes the brief, news stories are as likely to be broken by ordinary citizens recording on their cell phones as by mainstream journalists for major publications. Likewise, most people consume news through audiovisual mediums, including online videos and podcasts, and the self-authenticating quality of audio recordings makes them a particularly persuasive means of conveying information. The brief further discusses the negative impacts of a requirement to give notice of recording, including chilling candid conversations and putting would-be recorders at risk of harassment and even violence.\n\nOregon is one of only five states that requires the consent of more than one party to audio recordings, and its broad prohibition on audio recordings—including in public places—is one of the most restrictive in the country.\n\nCONTACT:\n\nDaniel Burnett, Senior Director of Communications, FIRE: 215-717-3473; media@thefire.org\n\nLauren Gazzola, AALDP, press@aaldp.com\n\nDavid Perle, PETA, davidp@peta.org\n\nBelinda Davis, Animal Outlook, press@animaloutlook.org\n\nThe Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization dedicated to defending and sustaining the individual rights of all Americans to free speech and free thought—the most essential qualities of liberty. FIRE educates Americans about the importance of these inalienable rights, promotes a culture of respect for these rights, and provides the means to preserve them.\n\nPETA — whose motto reads, in part, that “animals are not ours to use in any way” — points out that Every Animal Is Someone and offers free Empathy Kits for people who need a lesson in kindness. For more information, please visit PETA.org or follow the group on X, Facebook, or Instagram.\n\nAnimal Outlook strategically challenges animal agribusiness through undercover investigations, legal advocacy, corporate and food system reform, and disseminating information about the many harms of animal agriculture, empowering everyone to choose vegan.\n\nThe Animal Activist Legal Defense Project at the University of Denver Sturm College of Law works to empower and defend animal advocates through activist defense, affirmative litigation, and training law students to join and transform the field of animal law.

      "# [Jenifer’s Shelter Island Journal: Dinner at six by Jenifer Maxson on 2025-02-03](https://shelterislandreporter.timesreview.com/2025/02/03/jenifers-shelter-island-journal-dinner-at-six/)\nYes, “at six.” Though it’s still an homage, in part, to that iconic, star-studded 1934 film, “Dinner at Eight” featuring, among others, John Barrymore (playing Barrymore) and the dazzling and hilarious Jean Harlow.\n\nThe fact is, now in my dotage, if I had to wait until 8 o’clock to eat, I’d have already gnawed my arm halfway to the elbow. So yes, this past Wednesday, for the first time in years, I actually cooked dinner and invited five people to eat it with me. Yup, six at six.\n\nTo some extent, I was inspired by the sweet little dining “corner” that’s part of the addition to my house which, Lord knows, I’ve mentioned enough in this space.\n\nBut also it struck me that I hadn’t hosted an official “dinner party” with food that I actually cooked and with people to whom I was not blood-related, since — is it possible? — New Year’s Eve 2018? Not that I had been the Perle Mesta (for those of you who remember Perle) of Shelter Island by any means, but my nice, roomy dining room had seen, over the decades, its share of family celebrations, of course, but also some big parties and little dinners to which “civilians” had been invited. Nice.\n\nSix months after that New Year’s dinner, my husband, Tom, died and six months after that the COVID Invasion began so, for me, if I’d thought about it at all, I suspect I’d have lumped “dinner parties” with other quaint vestiges of bygone eras, like stockings with seams, phones with cords, jukeboxes with nickels.\n\nStrange times.\n\nIt was about then that I mounted my half-hearted cyber campaign to find a reasonable facsimile of a significant other. It turned out, however, that nobody was “Tom” and, besides, remote relationships were nothing if not, well, remote. But by then, “remote” was in fashion, what with masks and limited occupancy and mandatory 6-foot distances between humans, at work or at play.\n\nNo question that Queen Corona had ginned-up “remote” to a whole new level for everyone, not just 70-something widows, but — and perhaps it’s struck some of you, too — she didn’t start this trend. Mesmerized by technology, our society has been, for years, redefining “human connection” almost beyond recognition.\n\nThe results seem to suggest that loneliness has become a major by-product, a newfangled kind of loneliness that isn’t necessarily “solved,” or even assuaged by the presence of other people, who themselves are often attending to their own personal devices.\n\nI recall writing a column on the increase in loneliness, ambient loneliness, I now realize, a few years ago in response to an article about the United Kingdom creating a Ministry of Loneliness back in 2019. The British government produces a policy paper every year since to track the nation’s progress which, fortunately, has been considerable, but they admit there is much, much more to be done.\n\nOur Surgeon General Dr. Vivek H. Murthy writes in his 2023 Surgeon General’s Advisory Report, “Our Epidemic of Loneliness and Isolation:” “… Given the profound consequences of loneliness and isolation, we have an opportunity, and an obligation, to make the same investments in addressing social connection that we have made in addressing tobacco use, obesity, and the addiction crisis.”\n\nDr. Murthy continues, “If we fail to do so, we will pay an ever-increasing price in our individual and collective health and well-being. And we will continue to splinter and divide until we can no longer stand as a community or a country … and we will further retreat to our corners — angry, sick, and alone.”\n\nIn its survey from this past October, “What is Causing Our Epidemic of Loneliness and How Can We Fix It?” the Harvard School of Graduate Education published these findings regarding the causes of loneliness in America:\n\n• Technology — 73% of those surveyed selected technology as contributing to loneliness in America.\n\n• Insufficient time with family — 66% chose this issue as a reason.\n\n• “People are overworked or too busy or tired” — 62% surveyed picked this concern.\n\n• Mental health challenges that harm relationships with others — 60% of people rated this as a problem.\n\n• 58% named “Living in a society that is too individualistic.”\n\n• No religious or spiritual life, too much focus on one’s own feelings, the changing nature of work, more remote and hybrid schedules — were all perceived as cause by around 50% of participants.\n\nAnd from most-to-least lonely, this is how the various ages fared: The loneliest group of participants, at 29%, are ages 30-44; the next, at 24%, are ages 18-29; at 20% are ages 45-64; and the least lonely, at only 10%, is the 65-plus group.\n\nSo, the six of us sat down together last Wednesday out of hunger and curiosity about the other five. Nice. We had to start somewhere.",

      "# [Mike Lynch yacht disaster: Missing tycoon’s ties to UK spy chiefs by Laurie Clarke on 2024-08-20](https://www.politico.eu/article/missing-tech-tycoon-mike-lynchs-ties-to-uk-spy-chiefs/)\nLONDON — It was a freak yachting accident that gripped the world.\n\nAnd the disappearance of British tech tycoon Mike Lynch in stormy seas off the coast of Sicily was even made stranger by the fact that two days earlier, his business partner Stephen Chamberlain was fatally injured in a car accident.\n\nAs long-standing business associates, the pair were tried as co-defendants in a fraud trial over the sale of software company Autonomy to Hewlett-Packard for $11 billion (£7 billion). Following the sale of Autonomy in 2011, Lynch co-founded the cybersecurity firm Darktrace and Chamberlain was appointed chief financial officer.\n\nThe Cambridge-based company fights cyberattacks using software that learns the behavioral patterns of every actor within an organization and detects unusual activity.\n\nThere is nothing so far to indicate foul play in either man’s respective accidents, which have been put down to a tragic coincidence.\n\nAdding to the intrigue, however, are the business partners’ ties to the worlds of U.K. and U.S. intelligence.\n\nSpy connections\n\nLynch co-founded Darktrace in partnership with former U.K. intelligence officials in 2013.\n\nOne of the co-founders was Stephen Huxter, a high-ranking figure in MI5’s cyber defense team, who became a managing director at Darktrace.\n\nLynch’s $1 billion VC fund Invoke Capital — set up following the sale of Autonomy — backed the Cambridge University spin-out with an initial investment of £12 million.\n\nHuxter hired 30-year GCHQ veteran Andrew France as the company’s chief executive — he later joined the company’s board. Lynch sat on the board until 2018, when he stepped down after being charged with fraud.\n\nFormer head of MI5 Jonathan Evans also sat on the Darktrace’s board for a time, while Jim Penrose, a 17-year veteran of the U.S.’s National Security Agency, formerly headed up the company's American operations.\n\nOther former spooks at the company included director of technology Dave Palmer, who previously worked at MI5 and GCHQ, and director of security John Richardson, who worked on cyber defence for the UK government.\n\nBut Lynch’s connections with the murky sphere of intelligence predated Darktrace. His first company Cambridge Neurodynamics, which specialized in computer-based fingerprint recognition, held contracts with the U.K. intelligence agencies.\n\n“They have the most interesting problems,” he told Wired magazine in 2002.\n\nLynch spun Autonomy out of Neurodynamics in 1996. The company, which Chamberlain joined in 2005, used machine learning to analyze data from sources such as intercepted phone calls and emails.\n\nA fan of the fictional spy James Bond, Lynch named conference rooms in Autonomy’s headquarters after the movie series’ villains including Dr. No and Goldfinger. He was said to have had a fish tank in the firm’s reception area filled with vicious piranhas, as a tribute to a scene in the movie “You Only Live Twice.”\n\nAutonomy also scored high-profile tenders from U.K. and U.S. government agencies, including a contract to provide infrastructure to the U.S. Office of Homeland Security to analyze intelligence as part of the war on terrorism following 9/11.\n\nA 2003 Guardian article described the company as “dealing with secret intelligence” and “among the few UK commercial organizations that stand to profit from the Iraq war.” It described the company’s technology as “advanced computer eavesdropping systems.”\n\nAt that time, the company held other contracts with U.S. government agencies including the army, NASA, and US intelligence agencies. GCHQ and MI6 were also believed to be clients.\n\nRichard Perle, a former Pentagon appointee who at that time served as chair of the Pentagon’s defense advisory board, acted as one of the company’s directors.\n\nFraud case\n\nA year after the sale of Autonomy, HP claimed that the firm’s value had been exaggerated. In 2018, U.S. prosecutors brought charges against Lynch and he was extradited to the U.S. to face trial in 2022.\n\nThe company's chief financial officer, Sushovan Hussain, was convicted of fraud in 2018 and later sentenced to five years in prison.\n\nHowever, Lynch unexpectedly escaped conviction on the basis that he focused on the company's tech and had little knowledge of its finances. He put his escape down to being wealthy enough to afford the legal fees involved in fighting the case in the U.S. courts. He was represented by the same defense lawyer as the disgraced late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nIn April, Darktrace agreed to a $5.3 billion (£4.2 billion) takeover by the U.S. private equity firm Thoma Bravo.\n\nSearches for survivors from the yacht accident are ongoing. Lynch’s 18-year-old daughter, Hannah, Morgan Stanley International Bank chair Jonathan Bloomer, and Clifford Chance lawyer Chris Morvillo, are also among those missing.\n\n“We do not exclude that they are not inside the boat, but we know the boat sank quickly,” said Vincenzo Zagarola, a spokesperson for the Italian coastguard on Tuesday. “We suppose that the six people missing may not have had time to get out.”"
