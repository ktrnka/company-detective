      "# [Cloud Observability Solutions on 2023-08-10](https://chronosphere.io/solutions/)\nInfrastructure metrics are the backbone of your observability implementation. This is especially true in a cloud native infrastructure environment. With an efficient cloud infrastructure monitoring solution that was purpose-built to reliably handle the scale of cloud native, you will know about issues before your customers do.\n\nChronosphere ingests a variety of open source infrastructure metrics formats from Prometheus to Graphite/StatsD and ships with out of the box dashboards like cAdvisor that give you instant insight into your Kubernetes clusters making Kubernetes monitoring easy.\n\nWith Prometheus, you can export infrastructure metrics from virtually any server, database, or service mesh. Monitoring infrastructure is a foundational to your observability strategy.\n\nApplication performance monitoring (APM,) or the task of troubleshooting application errors or performance issues, is no easy feat in a distributed microservices environment. With Chronosphere, engineers of any experience level can understand the root cause of issues via the insights provided by the automated analysis of the underlying Observability data.\n\nHarnessing the power of distributed tracing via OpenTelemetry, your tangled mess of microservices goes from unintelligible to understandable. The results? Fewer incidents, faster resolution, happier customers and developers thanks to the power of cloud native application monitoring.\n\nWhen your business moves at the speed of cloud, you can’t wait hours or days to understand business impact. With Chronosphere’s millisecond ingest and one second alert intervals, you can react to business metrics like revenue flow and customer engagement in seconds.\n\nWith a single solution that can connect infrastructure errors through to application performance all the way up to business impacts, you always have a 360 degree view of your business performance.\n\nCloud native environments produce massive amounts of telemetry data. Developers need this data to effectively operate and troubleshoot systems, but it quickly leads to observability costs spiraling out of control.\n\nWith Chronosphere, you still collect all the same data, but it’s aggregated and transformed into actionable insight that is usable for developers, while also being highly cost efficient. The result is greater predictability, increased accountability, and significant cost savings.\n\nWhen customer-facing issues arise, your developers need the best tools to solve these issues, fast. Chronosphere rapidly orients developers to the problem at hand with context-rich alerts and seamless linking of data types for faster time to triage. With a solution that is accessible for all levels of developers, you will no longer have your most senior resources pulled into every incident response.\n\nThe results? When you can scale reliably and meet customer demand, you’ll see increased revenue and less customer churn.\n\nWhen your observability solution is unreliable, the entire organization suffers. Developers can’t ship code, or worse, fly blind during an outage. They spend longer on troubleshooting, which means they are slower to deliver new features, which in turn frustrates customers and puts revenue at risk.\n\nWith Chronosphere, you gain an observability platform that is reliable, scalable, and performant, so engineers spend less time in the weeds and more time innovating\n\nWhile many organizations begin their cloud native observability journey with open source tools like Prometheus or Jaeger, they quickly run into major hurdles. The two big challenges that companies face when running their own open source observability in-house is the significant management overhead and tooling that is unreliable and slow.\n\nWith Chronosphere, you get the best of both worlds: a fully open source compatible solution that relieves the management overview and delivers best in class availability and performance. Win-win.",

      "# [FAQs on 2023-08-10](https://chronosphere.io/faqs/)\nChronosphere’s Observability Platform\n\nThe Chronosphere platform can ingest metrics, events, logs and distributed trace data in a variety of open source formats, such as Prometheus and OpenTelemetry, and gives teams the ability to cut through the noise to rapidly detect, understand and remediate issues before they impact customers.\n\nChronosphere’s Telemetry Pipeline\n\nChronosphere Telemetry Pipeline, from the creators of Fluent Bit and Calyptia, streamlines log collection, aggregation, transformation, and routing from any source to any destination.\n\nThis allows companies who are dealing with high costs and complexity the ability to control their data and scale their growing business needs.\n\nMonitoring data is growing faster than infrastructure/apps built to monitor it, and the increase in scale has created bottlenecks for reliability, performance and cost.\n\nThe result is that you often end up flying blind because metrics are not available or are too hard to find quickly. When surges in metric cardinality or read traffic happen in solutions not built for this level of complexity, it gets very expensive, very fast, the problem gets ignored, or the dashboards take too long to load, leading to system failures.\n\nWith Chronosphere, users have tools to help them understand their metric data in real-time, and filter/group by any metric labels to understand what the biggest contributors to write traffic are.\n\nChronosphere Observability Platform has a unique pricing model that is different from others out there. Instead of pricing based on host or VM, Chronosphere only charges for the useful data that you choose to retain in the Chronosphere Observability Platform. With our Control Plane, you can analyze and shape your observability data to fulfill your existing dashboard and alerting needs without having to store all the data in the raw form. Unlike other observability solutions that require you to store, query, and pay for all data, whether or not it is useful, Chronosphere pre-computes the data to get rid of the waste and efficiently delivers it to the glass.\n\nEvery organization’s needs are very different, so we want to work with you to drive the right value at the right price, without the fear of overages or huge price hikes when your data complexity inevitably grows.\n\nFor the Chronosphere Telemetry Pipeline, we follow a straightforward pricing model, based solely on data throughput – the volume of raw data you transmit through the pipeline. We understand that every team’s needs are different, so we work with you to drive the right value at the right price.\n\nNo concept of paid support here – we want to work with you every step of the way. We have dedicated customer success resources and offer 24/7 x 365 communications by Slack, Zendesk, or e-mail, in addition to options for weekly office hours, ad-hoc calls, and shared Slack channels. You are assigned a technical account manager, solution engineer, and account executive that you’ll have direct access to.\n\nAre you a customer needing to access our team or get a question answered? Reach out to our support team here, and someone will be with you ASAP!\n\nDue to the highly customized nature of each organization’s observability aggregation and rollup needs, we will work with you to stand up a pilot. The onboarding process depends on the scale of the deployment, but the goal is to prove out the required capabilities.\n\nPilots are typically free, unless you are running a large scale or long term pilot. The average pilot is 2-3 weeks long, during which you’ll be able to try out Chronosphere with your actual production data, with longer-term evaluations possible (most likely a paid pilot for long durations of evaluation).\n\nWe will work with you to tune control plane policies, define different resolution, and retention policies specific to your needs, and you will have full access to the same support you’d get as a Chronosphere customer. Ready to start a pilot? Click here to speak to our experts about your needs.\n\nThe Chronosphere collector is responsible for ingesting metrics and traces from a customer’s various applications and then sending them along to the Chronosphere backend. It is the only Chronosphere software deployed in customer environments. You can set up as many collectors as you need.\n\nFor a full explanation of how it works, check out our blog post on how Chronosphere collects metrics.\n\nChronosphere is a flexible SaaS solution, built for scaling cloud native engineering organizations.\n\nThe Chronosphere platform can ingest metrics and distributed trace data in a variety of open source formats, as well as Chronosphere collector instances which are the only pieces of technology that needs to be deployed by customers.The datastore and dashboards are fully provided and managed by Chronosphere.\n\nCustomers can manage their configuration through our Terraform provider or a command-line tool, in addition to through the UI.\n\nWe have a 99.9% SLA, calculated on a per-tenant basis.\n\nAvailability is determined continuously and automatically by monitoring for tenant downtime by having an external probe write a randomly generated datapoint and read it back, to verify that the platform is successfully persisting data and the whole end to end flow is working.\n\nWe calculate the SLA specifically for your tenant, not everyone, with a focus on the ability to read and write data.\n\nLearn more about our Commitment to Availability.\n\nChronosphere Telemetry Pipeline follows a hybrid or bring your own cloud (BYOC) architecture pattern by default. This means the data plane (where data processing occurs) is deployed in your environment, while Chronosphere hosts the management plane (where commands are issued).\n\nThis deployment model allows for rapid deployment of multiple core instances within different environments or clouds. For example, you can have five Telemetry Pipeline core instances deployed across Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, your private data center, and even your laptop.\n\nTelemetry Pipeline does not require any inbound network connections and instead only require a single outbound connection the management plane\n\nThis architecture gives the following advantages:\n\nFaster processing and lower latency: When the data plane is deployed closer to the data source, there are less latency and network hops required.\n\nIncreased data privacy: With data collection and processing staying within the environment, there is less risk of data leaking out of the environment outside of its sovereignty or compliance boundary. Chronosphere has no access to the underlying data.\n\nCost optimization: When data is processed (mainly reduced or removed) within your environment this can vastly decrease your bandwidth and egress charges within public cloud environments.",

      "# [Control your data](https://docs.chronosphere.io/control)\nYour app generates a lot of data, but not all of it's useful. Storing every byte is costly, and can quickly overwhelm your capacity limit, license limit, or both. Aside from financial cost, there's computing cost associated with generating, processing, and temporarily storing your telemetry data.\n\nReducing data volume keeps costs predictable and manageable as your business scales, and helps teams manage their data effectively by reducing the amount of available information. When you optimize your data, on-call engineers can find the data they need to solve problems faster.\n\nTo take control of your data, Chronosphere Observability Platform provides multiple tools you can use to identify and eliminate data that isn't used and doesn't deliver value to your business. See Chronosphere control entities to learn about the mechanisms you can use to control your data.\n\nUnderstand consumption and limits\n\nManage license consumption by reviewing licensing dashboards to identify usage trends and avoid exceeding your organization's licensing limits.\n\nUnderstand data limits for each telemetry type to ensure a performant experience when ingesting, querying, and creating resources.\n\nShape metric data\n\nUse the Chronosphere Control Plane to shape your metric data and reduce the amount of data you persist. Manage your data with tools that help you shape that traffic, such as creating drop rules, quotas, and aggregation rules.\n\nSample trace data\n\nCreate trace datasets that map tracing license consumption to relevant business units in your organization. Datasets let you track and measure data usage over time before you implement sampling strategies, whereas head and tail sampling alone require you to measure and implement together.",
      "# [Overview of alerting](https://docs.chronosphere.io/alerts)\nOne reason to ingest and store time series data is to know when data does or doesn't meet certain criteria. To generate alerts and notifications from data, regardless of whether it's about your system or about your use of Chronosphere Observability Platform itself, use alerting.\n\nYou create monitors to query time series, and optionally group results into signals. Whenever a time series meets a condition, an alert triggers that sends a notification. You can mute notifications with muting rules.\n\nMonitors\n\nObservability Platform alerting revolves around monitors. You can watch time series data that's specified in a monitor query. The results of a monitor query can be time series data or the outcome of a function applied to time series data. Because Observability Platform is a single data store, you can merge alerts, which lets an alert query all metrics and not only metrics local to a Prometheus instance.\n\nConditions\n\nConditions are evaluations run against every time series from the resulting monitor query, along with a related severity, such as critical or warning. For example, conditions can help you determine if a time series value remains greater than 1 for more than 30 seconds. If this happens, Observability Platform can display a warning alert.\n\nYou can also specify condition overrides to override the default conditions that define when an alert triggers for a monitor.\n\nSignals\n\nSignals are optional groupings by label of the results returned from a monitor query. For example, you can use signals to group time series from multiple environments, such as development or production, to generate separate alerts for each environment.\n\nIn Observability Platform, on the Monitors page, monitors with defined signals display the file tree icon. To view the signals from a displayed monitor, click the name of the monitor from the list.\n\nObservability Platform supports converting from Prometheus alerts to signals, and strongly recommends using signals instead of configuring complex routing trees to route notifications:\n\nYou can configure signals for individual monitors, which isolates changes to only that monitor. Prometheus requires a single global configuration, and any change impacts users across your entire organization.\n\nSignals let you group notifications within the monitor itself, rather than grouping notifications within the notification routing tree. This model makes signals easier to manage as part of a monitor configuration.\n\nAlerts\n\nAlerts occur when one or more monitor query results trigger a condition. Configuring the monitor signal to group query results generates an alert for each signal that triggers a condition.\n\nNotifications\n\nWhen an alert triggers, and optionally when an alert resolves, Observability Platform sends a notification to specified endpoints called notifiers, including PagerDuty, email, and Slack. You configure your notifications with notification policies.\n\nMuting rules\n\nUsing Observability Platform, you can temporarily mute notifications for a triggered alert. These muting rules can apply to:",

      "# [Ingest telemetry data](https://docs.chronosphere.io/ingest)\nBefore you can use Chronosphere Observability Platform to view and manage your observability data (of whatever type), you need to get that data into Observability Platform.\n\nObservability Platform supports multiple methods to ingest telemetry data, which depend on which type of data you want to ingest:\n\nIngestion methodChange eventsLogsMetricsTracesChronosphere CollectorOpenTelemetry CollectorTelemetry Pipeline or Core AgentExisting pipelineDirect to Observability Platform\n\nAfter ingesting telemetry data, you can use the control mechanisms that Observability Platform provides to control costs and ensure you're ingesting only the data you care about.\n\nChronosphere utilizes push and pull models of ingestion, depending on the data collected and the method of ingestion.\n\nPull models, like the Chronosphere Collector, scrape data from external sources and pull it in. These metrics have consistent reporting intervals.\n\nPush models, like tracing, send data to Chronosphere, which is then processed. These metrics can have a broad spectrum of reporting frequency, from large bursts of data to long periods with no data reporting.\n\nTelemetryPushPullMetricsTracesLogs\n\nThe ingestion model depends on the data source. Metrics pushed to Observability Platform can have latency delays or sparse time series which can result in unexpected query results.\n\nMetric and trace data\n\nTo ingest metrics and traces, you must configure one of the collection methods. Use the Chronosphere Collector or OpenTelemetry Collector for metric and trace data. Google Cloud metrics can also be directly ingested.\n\nChange event data\n\nChange event data gets sent directly to Observability Platform, and doesn't require an independent collection mechanism. Use Observability Platform or CreateEvent API to send your change events (opens in a new tab).\n\nYou can also ingest change events directly from supported third-party tools such as Amazon EventBridge, Buildkite, and LaunchDarkly.\n\nLog data\n\nTo ingest log data, Chronosphere recommends using Core Agent or a combination of Core Agent plus Telemetry Pipeline. Chronosphere also supports using your existing ingest pipeline to ingest log data, such as Fluent Bit or LogStash. You can also ingest log data using the OpenTelemetry Collector.\n\nControl costs\n\nIngesting more telemetry data increases your overall data and storage costs. Observability Platform provides several control mechanisms to manage the data you ingest.\n\nMetric data\n\nUse the following methods to control the metric data you ingest:\n\nProfile and analyze metrics for their usage and cost.\n\nCreate drop rules to drop incoming metrics based on labels.\n\nShape metric data with quotas.\n\nReduce the persisted metrics and cardinality at the cost of increased writes.\n\nTracing data\n\nUse the following methods to control the tracing data you ingest:",
      "# [Chronoctl](https://docs.chronosphere.io/chronoctl)\nChronoctl\n\nChronoctl is a Chronosphere-supplied app that lets you manage your organization's Chronosphere Observability Platform resources from the command line.\n\nFor example, to list your team's monitor definitions:\n\nGetting started\n\nTo install Chronoctl, see Install Chronoctl.\n\nTo use Chronoctl, you must provide an API token and organization name to authenticate as an account with administrative privileges, either by configuring them as environment variables or passing them with the command. You can also securely authenticate by using the chronoctl auth command.\n\nAfter you're ready to use Chronoctl, refer to its commands to directly control your Observability Platform environment.\n\nSupported resources\n\nUse Chronoctl commands to take actions on Observability Platform resources, such as dashboards, teams, or collections. To display a list of the resources supported by your installed version of Chronoctl, view the Chronoctl help:\n\nThe list of available resources displays in the Chronosphere Configuration section of the output.\n\nCommand list\n\nRequires Chronoctl version 0.53.0 or later.\n\nChronoctl is based on the structure of the Chronosphere API, which helps its commands be as consistent with one another as possible. This also better reflects features as they're presented for use in the Chronosphere API itself.\n\nFlags\n\nEach command has several flags for customizing its output or behavior.\n\nIn addition to the authentication flags, flags that are common among commands include:\n\n-h, --help: Outputs help text for the given command.\n\n--timeout: Defines a duration in seconds for the request before it times out and fails. Defaults to 30 seconds.\n\nChronoctl commands that return data representations of resources have additional common flags:\n\n-o, --output: Defines the output format. Accepts json for JSON, jsonl for JSON Lines, or defaults to yaml for YAML.\n\nChronoctl commands that can change the state of a resource in Observability Platform, such as chronoctl apply or resource create and update subcommands, also have:\n\n-d, --dry-run: If set, Chronoctl simulates but doesn't apply the manifest or change in a dry run, and then displays the predicted result.\n\n--no-strict: If set, Chronoctl accepts manifests or changes that contain unknown fields.\n\nSlugs\n\nObservability Platform identifies each resource by a unique slug, which has a 255-character length limit and contains only letters, numbers, underscores (_), and dashes (-). Slugs are case-sensitive. By default, Observability Platform generates a random slug (containing less than 255 characters) for each resource. Chronoctl lets you optionally specify a slug when creating resources.\n\nConfiguration commands\n\nConfiguration commands are the recommended way to interact with Observability Platform resources. Use the apply command for interacting with multiple resources, but in most cases, uses the configuration commands.\n\nEach of these commands are specific to Observability Platform resource types, which have the same following subcommands:\n\ncreate\n\ndelete\n\nlist\n\nread\n\nscaffold\n\nupdate\n\ncreate\n\nCreates one resource of the given type. For example:\n\nReplace the following:\n\nRESOURCE: The resource you want to take action on.\n\nFILE_NAME: The name of the definition file you want to use.\n\nFor more information about the subcommand, including its usage and accepted flags, see the Chronoctl command line help.\n\nReplace RESOURCE with the resource you want to take action on.\n\ndelete\n\nDeletes one resource of the given type. For example:\n\nReplace the following:\n\nRESOURCE: The resource you want to take action on.\n\nSLUG: The slug of the resource you want to delete.\n\nFor more information about the subcommand, including its usage and accepted flags, see the Chronoctl command line help.\n\nReplace RESOURCE with the resource you want to take action on.\n\nlist\n\nLists all resources of the given type. For example:\n\nReplace RESOURCE with the resource you want to take action on.\n\nFor more information about the subcommand, including its usage and accepted flags, see the Chronoctl command line help.\n\nReplace RESOURCE with the resource you want to take action on.\n\nread\n\nOutputs one resource of the given type. For example:\n\nReplace the following:\n\nRESOURCE: The resource you want to take action on.\n\nSLUG: The slug of the resource you want to output.\n\nFor more information about the subcommand, including its usage and accepted flags, see the Chronoctl command line help.\n\nReplace RESOURCE with the resource you want to take action on.\n\nscaffold\n\nOutputs an example resource definition of the given type, including inline comments documenting its properties. For example:\n\nReplace RESOURCE with the resource you want to take action on.\n\nupdate\n\nUpdates a resource of the given type. For example:\n\nReplace the following:\n\nRESOURCE: The resource you want to take action on.\n\nFILE_NAME: The name of the definition file you want to use.\n\nFor more information about the subcommand, including its usage and accepted flags, see the Chronoctl command line help.\n\nReplace RESOURCE with the resource you want to take action on.\n\nCore commands\n\nChronoctl core commands are independent of any resource type.\n\napply\n\nApplies a configuration change to resources from a YAML or JSON file, or from standard input. When you apply resources with Chronoctl, Observability Platform creates them if they don't already exist.\n\nThe apply command accepts input from a file by providing the path as the value of the -f (--filename) flag.\n\nFor example, to apply a file containing a resource's YAML manifest:\n\nTo apply a resource passed from standard input, use the - value of the -f flag:\n\nUpon success, the command returns the list of changes applied.\n\nThe apply command accepts the dry run (-d, --dry-run) flag, which displays the changes without applying them.\n\nauth\n\nRequires Chronoctl version 1.8.0 or later (or Chronoctl 0.65.0 or later if you're using a version earlier than 1.0.0).\n\nHandles secure programmatic access to Observability Platform. This command lets users access their organizations' applications after authentication with Chronoctl.\n\nlogin: Authenticate the Chronoctl session as your Observability Platform user.\n\nlist: List all authenticated Observability Platform organizations the current user can access. Users might have access to multiple organizations such as a production and a test organization.\n\nprint-session-id: Print the stored session id for an Observability Platform organization.\n\nset-default-org: Sets the default Observability Platform organization for future commands.\n\nTo sign in, use this command:\n\nReplace YOUR-ORG-NAME with the organization you want to sign in to. For example, if your Observability Platform tenant is https://acme.chronosphere.io, replace YOUR-ORG-NAME with acme, and then follow the prompts.\n\nThis process generates a session_ID, which is cached on your machine and valid for 24 hours. If a personal access token or service account token isn't passed to Chronoctl using an environment variable or command line flag, Chronoctl uses the cached session_ID to authenticate your command.\n\nState commands\n\nThese commands evaluate the current state of Observability Platform.\n\nrule-evaluations list\n\nThe list subcommand is the only subcommand for rule-evaluations.\n\nReturns a list of rule evaluation failures, including the rule's type, slug, failure count, message, and detection timestamp.\n\nSync commands\n\nThe sync command accepts the prometheus subcommand only. Use the sync prometheus command to sync a Prometheus rules YAML file and a Prometheus Alertmanager YAML configuration file into Chronosphere format.\n\nYou include a chronoconfig.yaml file to assign the rules to a team, and to specify a team to own the related notification policy. This command converts and applies the assets and resources to your tenant.\n\nTo sync Prometheus rules into Chronosphere format:\n\nDefine a chronoconfig.yaml file to assign the converted rules to a team, and specify a team to own the related notification policy:\n\nuse_collections:\"TRUE\" group_teams: - group_regex:\".*\" team_slug:\"OWNER_TEAM\" notification_policy_team_slug:\"POLICY_TEAM\"\n\nReplace the following:\n\nOWNER_TEAM: The slug of the Observability Platform team to own the converted rules.\n\nPOLICY_TEAM: The slug of the Observability Platform team to own the notification policy.\n\nRun the sync prometheus command and pass in your Prometheus rules file, Prometheus Alertmanager configuration file, and chronoconfig.yaml file:\n\nchronoctlsyncprometheus-a [ALERTMANAGER_CONFIG] -p [PROM_RULES] -c chronoconfig.yaml [FLAGS]\n\nReplace the following:\n\nALERTMANAGER_CONFIG: The file containing your Prometheus Alertmanager configuration.\n\nPROM_RULES: The file containing your Prometheus rules.\n\nFLAGS: Any flags to include with the command.

From my unsophisticated perspective, it appears that Grafana is the first mover in the space (meaning they were the first to raise VC funding and the are now valued the most (recently valued at $6 BN) vs Chronosphere which is now valued at $1 BN; however with the rapid growth of the market—is the market big enough for multiple players. And can companies like Grafana grow beyond the niche confines of the observability market? Can larger companies like Elastic displace smaller companies or are they complementary?\n\nBeyond these high level questions—how are these companies to work with? Are they easy to work with and put the customer first? How aggressive are they in moving customers to paying for premium services?\n\nAny thoughts and feedback are welcome and appreciated!!\n\n## Comment ID i3zp80t with +4 score by [(raptorjesus69, Reddit, 2022-04-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/grafana/comments/tzdvak/grafana_vs_chronosphere_vs_cribl/i3zp80t/) (in reply to ID tzdvak):\nThe other thing that sets grafana apart from the other two is grafana contributes much more to open source then the other companies. Grafana open sources there whole frontend along with all their databases. The only closed source parts of Grafanas observability tools are done plugins. That is what I think sets them a part from other observability vendors\n\n## Comment ID i3z0whv with +2 score by [(SelfDestructSep2020, Reddit, 2022-04-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/grafana/comments/tzdvak/grafana_vs_chronosphere_vs_cribl/i3z0whv/) (in reply to ID tzdvak):\n> can companies like Grafana grow beyond the niche confines of the observability market\n\nWhy would they need to? How/why would that influence why you'd select them as an observability provider?\n\nAnyways for your study you should probably also throw Honeycomb into your research.\n\n### Comment ID i3z60na with +1 score by [(ajreddi, Reddit, 2022-04-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/grafana/comments/tzdvak/grafana_vs_chronosphere_vs_cribl/i3z60na/) (in reply to ID i3z0whv):\nI am not looking at them to select a vendor—more just to get a sense for how the market evolves and who the winners and losers are.

Really interesting technology and love the direction.\n\n## Comment ID ihin4zg with +2 score by [(DarkLordofData, Reddit, 2022-07-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/grafana/comments/tzdvak/grafana_vs_chronosphere_vs_cribl/ihin4zg/) (in reply to ID tzdvak):\nThese are really different vendors so you would not be really comparing the same tech. Cribl specializes in getting data into the platform of your choice while chronosphere and Grafana are data analytics engines with a lot of focus on metrics. Cribl and Grafana are all very easy to work with large free tiers. I don’t have a ton of experience working with Chronosphere. The demo looks good, but their focus is too narrow for me. I don’t know if it has free tier. I want metrics and traces not just metrics. Grafana has some nice features but needs more analytics options and I would prefer options for security to use it as well. Cribl is a great option to scale your staff and gather pretty much any data for your analytics backends you can route your data anywhere and are not limited by your vendors at all. If you want to use one agent and route the same event to Grafana/ELK and Splunk for different use cases not a problem. Makes it all very easy and you can shape your data anyway you want. From an architecture POV I like decoupling data collection/management from your analytics platforms. Makes it easy to use whatever data platform you want and not feel stuck.  Cribl supports any data use case so operations/o11y/security use cases are no problem.",

If so, the combat occurs in a giant sphere that consumes space and time, and you're fighting to reach the center and destroy the boss and disable it to protect nearby planets. Inside the sphere reality and time are warped.\n\nBut aside from a general theme of warped time/reality there is no specific explanation for why the game is turn-based.

All animations looks ended in between \"turns\" so character fast moving and then immediately absolutely stable and still. It ruins feel of dynamic.\nI think about stopping at any frame of animation and blend animation from that state to the new one.\nIf it works, addition of physics and inertia also can make things more natural.\n\n### Comment ID jijplb3 with +5 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieDev/comments/135dj3g/making_progress_on_our_turnbasedrealtime/jijplb3/) (in reply to ID jijamgp):\nMight not feel normal. But I’d have to play it to tell if it’s actually not good.\n\nGame looks cool imo, turn based doesn’t have to mean slow, if you played any classic rogue likes like Brogue.\n\nThis is fast turn based, and if you want to animate it, new approaches are warranted.\n\n#### Comment ID jikbd4y with +1 score by [(oberguga, Reddit, 2023-05-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieDev/comments/135dj3g/making_progress_on_our_turnbasedrealtime/jikbd4y/) (in reply to ID jijplb3):\nI'm not sure that it is not good, but I feel somewhat dizzy because of frequent interupts. So I suggest add some continuity to animation. Maybe in form of slow mo between turns, so if you do nothing it eventually stops, but if you make frequent input it can work just like realtime. Or something... It need to be prototyped and tested, but for now all that interrupts looks slightly irritating for me .\n\n### Comment ID jijsqtd with +6 score by [(EffortStar, Reddit, 2023-05-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieDev/comments/135dj3g/making_progress_on_our_turnbasedrealtime/jijsqtd/) (in reply to ID jijamgp):\nIf I understand correctly you're noticing the very brief hitstop pauses that interrupt the turn playing out. These exist to give the brain time to interpret the events, to add weight to hits, and (in some cases) to allow animations to play out for events that would otherwise be instantaneous.\n\nThe system generally needs some massaging though, it made more sense before we added in animated characters.\n\n## Comment ID jik1ki3 with +4 score by [(N30_117, Reddit, 2023-05-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieDev/comments/135dj3g/making_progress_on_our_turnbasedrealtime/jik1ki3/) (in reply to ID 135dj3g):\nThe artstyle looks amazing.\n\n## Comment ID jik8l93 with +3 score by [(MakingaJessinmyPants, Reddit, 2023-05-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieDev/comments/135dj3g/making_progress_on_our_turnbasedrealtime/jik8l93/) (in reply to ID 135dj3g):\nThis looks unbelievably cool\n\n## Comment ID jik3ss4 with +4 score by [(ceaRshaf, Reddit, 2023-05-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieDev/comments/135dj3g/making_progress_on_our_turnbasedrealtime/jik3ss4/) (in reply to ID 135dj3g):\nI am really curios about this design choice.

We found that datadog is still actually fairly affordable all things considered. When you factor the amount of time we would spend maintaining the stack internally, or compare to the costs of other fully supported third party services with similar feature sets, it ended up being a sort of wash.\n\nIn the end we still use datadog because it doesn't cost disproportionately higher than the other options and because it provides a single pane of glass for all kinds of engineers across all parts of the BU (network folks, security folks, kubernetes folks, vcenter folks, DBAs, data analysts)\n\n### Comment ID jtqnxfy with +2 score by [(cryonine, Reddit, 2023-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/15b1057/datadog_costs_that_high/jtqnxfy/) (in reply to ID jtnqoys):\nAgree with this take. The biggest thing with Datadog is having a good framework around what metrics you bring in and training engineers on how to properly leverage metrics. In our old self-hosted system we brought in tons and tons of metrics that literally no one used and had questionable value. When we brought those apps into Datadog we figured out what we did and didn’t need based on what engineers looked at, figured out if they actually make sense, and helped people implement them.\n\nEventually we had a squad that was tasked to build a custom module that wrapped the DD logger. This had various safeguards and best practices we developed internally to act as guardrails. At the end of the day the cost was more than manageable and the data was meaningful.\n\nSimilar things with logging and tracing. We took in all traces, but we rarely retained any because it wasn’t necessary. Logs were indexed only if they were security-related and the rest were dumped to S3. We had ways for engineers to watch real-time logs elsewhere.\n\nDD costs are often times only astronomical if your organization doesn’t take the time to create meaningful metrics. You rarely need *all* the data, haha.\n\n#### Comment ID jtuhpgn with +2 score by [(salynch, Reddit, 2023-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/15b1057/datadog_costs_that_high/jtuhpgn/) (in reply to ID jtqnxfy):\nYou might find this Twitter thread resonates, as well: https://twitter.com/roskilli/status/1684351974559596544\n\n## Comment ID jtuhii4 with +4 score by [(salynch, Reddit, 2023-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/15b1057/datadog_costs_that_high/jtuhii4/) (in reply to ID 15b1057):\nThis has been covered a lot, and continues to come up:\n\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/sre/comments/rhko5f/what\\_you\\_use\\_for\\_observability/](https://www.reddit.com/r/sre/comments/rhko5f/what_you_use_for_observability/) \n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/wytllq/what\\_your\\_observability\\_stack\\_in\\_2022\\_looks\\_like/](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/wytllq/what_your_observability_stack_in_2022_looks_like/)\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/sre/comments/10wcomt/where\\_to\\_store\\_highcardinality\\_metrics/](https://www.reddit.com/r/sre/comments/10wcomt/where_to_store_highcardinality_metrics/)   \n\n...and Matt Duggan's recent blog post [Monitoring is a Pain](https://matduggan.com/were-all-doing-metrics-wrong/) discusses some interesting thoughts on this, as well.\n\nu/paigerduty at Chronosphere has [written about](https://thenewstack.io/conversations-im-sick-of-having-about-observability/) the brokenness of some observability cost models, when you hit a certain scale.\n\n## Comment ID jtteuxs with +3 score by [(GilderoyLockhartt, Reddit, 2023-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/15b1057/datadog_costs_that_high/jtteuxs/) (in reply to ID 15b1057):\nits not always about datadog.. all saas gets expensive when the org scale..

Companies like Chronosphere ([https://chronosphere.io/](https://chronosphere.io/)) allow for granular controls on what is getting ingressed, what is getting stored as well looking at overall usage to understand patterns to optimize.

One the really big problems with telemetry is as your org gets larger its starts to become extremely difficult manage over usage. Teams will not prioritize metrics/log clean up or worse they will assign it to the junior/bottom engineer. I spent months fighting with teams at a large retail company to get metrics and logs under control. This only really got fixed when we had to eat a 6 figure overage charge, though in that case a lot of teams just gutted there logs/metrics as they would rather fly blind than actually manage their integrations.   \n\n\nI led 2 massive telemetry migrations at that same company and what I learned is most engineers have not idea how logs/metrics/traces work at even a basic level. Teams will again try and assign the junior or bottom engineer to this work causing more problems. I had to explain the concept of cardinality in metrics at least once a week for over a year at one point.\n\n### Comment ID jtof908 with +6 score by [(thecurlyburl, Reddit, 2023-07-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/15b1057/datadog_costs_that_high/jtof908/) (in reply to ID jtoaecp):\nHaha oh man.

Also dd is severely lacking in its ability to write ad hoc queries for data. To be quite honest i think if i switch jobs again in the future i will avoid companies that rely on DD, thats how strongly i feel after using it for a year.

The company wants to save money on Sysdig, which is literally the only monitoring and observability we have right now.\n\nI suggested Dynatrace which I have a little bit of experience with, but was shot down.\n\nWe have not started the rollout of Datadog yet but my boss is 100% sold on it, so there's zero chance of me talking him out of it. I'm not experienced enough with metrics in general just yet, so I've been okay so far with Sysdig.\n\nSysdig is easy, they've got a library, so we just pick what we want and turn it on and customize the values.\n\nHowever, I'm literally the only person capable of getting the deployment of Datadog rolled out in the cluster, so I already know I'm going to have a bad time with configuring it once it's deployed if you're saying the engineering resources are crazy to get Datadog on parity with New Relic, because nobody else knows *anything* about metrics.\n\nWe have a talented, yet small, team of 8 developers plus myself as DevOps so I'd really appreciate any learning materials we can get our hands on so that Datadog can be given enough of a chance for me to show my boss that there are better alternatives without getting anyone fired.\n\nCan you recommend any books I could start reading now try to prepare myself for Datadog?

I haven't really got a chance to use it but I don't really hear bad things about it ever. My company is starting with Datadog very soon but has good feedback for our environment in comparison to New Relic during the POCs. The environment for us falls nicely in with DD's pricing and features (not very much dev work going on and many OOB solutions) so Dyna was significantly more expensive in our specific case.

Alerts are sorted and classifed in different slack channels tailored to each team/interest group.

Nothing comes close for H/A prom and the architecture between tempo, loki, and cortex are almost the same, which means you get a bit of efficiency gain when you are doing config across the stack. Cortex usage on grafana is effortless since they build for that stack, and you can have zero vendor lock-in going between self hosted and grafana cloud or amazon managed prom. \n\nThat sounded like an advertisement so here’s the bad parts:\n- the cortex memory footprint is much heavier than straight Prometheus since metrics are buffered in memory for 3h (default). It’s still cheaper for me due to s3 savings for infrequently accessed metrics. \n-  the cortex documentation borders on non existent except as a reference. It’s more like an api reference than an operations guide. \n- some bits of the stack like tempo are really early in their development, if you stack them against established apm products it’s far behind. It’s very promising though. They will outpace jaeger pretty quickly at least. \n\nA footnote that Prometheus is heavily dependent on a service discovery mechanism so if you have no service catalog or you aren’t using kubernetes then you will have to BYO catalog of things to monitor, versus the agent based approach of other systems where installing an agent just adds the host.\n\n### Comment ID hus17vl with +1 score by [(SuperQue, Reddit, 2022-01-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/sevtqs/whats_your_monitoring_stack/hus17vl/) (in reply to ID huonojq):\nYea, we had a Cortex cluster for doing some centralized data.

If you have mostly physical servers or VM's then it can get costly.\n\nFor log ingestion, they will charge you by volume.  So you really need to clean up your apps to make sure your log levels are appropriate.  For example, you should not be ingesting debug logs.  And for  your INFO logs, is all of that really needed?

I built out a very basic Prometheus and Grafana setup at my last company in a few days (plus a longer tail to get node_exporter rolled out everywhere, and replace the old metrics, but most of that was a matter of waiting on other teams, etc. None of it was much work). Handled metrics for 100+ VMs, some GKE clusters, and a bunch of apps running on them, plus some serverless stuff. The whole setup was about $50/month. Always had it on the todo list to scale that up, put better backups on the metrics data, do failover, etc. But it was rock solid and didn't really have any issues so that never became a priority. Nowadays, the built-in stuff in GCP and AWS are \"good enough\" for most purposes as the other comment points out and I'd start there, but going the Prometheus+Grafana route is still fine though I'd probably at least use Grafana Cloud to host the Grafana part (I'd rather let someone else worry about those upgrades).

Taking time off is promoted - I don't feel bad taking PTO to rest and recharge. The benefits and perks I receive make me feel truly appreciated and help me be more effective in my role (mental health counseling, gym credits, etc). Our founders are heavily involved, approachable, and have my full faith. I feel very fortunate to be working here, and probably talk about my job and the company a bit too often because I love it so much!",

Even at this fast pace, the company really enforces work-life balance by encouraging employees to take time off, not work weekends, and half day Fridays all summer. They really care about the mental and physical health of their employees.\n\nI highly recommend Chronosphere!",

      "# [Chronosphere Accelerates Revenue Growth and Global Customer Success with New Executive Leadership and Programs on 2024-05-07](https://chronosphere.io/news/chronosphere-accelerates-growth-new-executive-leadership/)\nNew York, May 7, 2024 — Observability innovator, Chronosphere, today announced strategic leadership moves to accelerate the company’s go-to-market initiatives, global scale, and customer support. Margaret Dawson joins the company as Global Head of Marketing and Bill Hineline is the new Field Chief Technology Officer. These moves come as Chronosphere continues to build out its full-stack observability platform following the acquisition of Calyptia earlier this year and increased investments in its European operations and partner alliances.\n\n“Both Margaret and Bill bring a wealth of experience helping customers increase the value and performance of critical technology platforms and innovations, and we are thrilled to have them on the team as our customers work to update their approach to observability and monitoring,” said Martin Mao, CEO of Chronosphere. “Their experience crafting customer and data-driven go-to-market strategies, as well as managing teams, will further propel our growth and adoption.\n\nA proven marketing and technology executive, Dawson brings more than 25 years of experience at early-stage startups and Fortune 500 companies. Most recently, she was Vice President of Portfolio Strategy and Chief of Staff to the CEO at Apptio, the leading technology spend and value management company, which IBM acquired in 2023. Prior to joining Apptio, she spent seven years at Red Hat, the leading provider of enterprise open source solutions. Ranked as one of the top Women in Cloud Computing, Dawson was named Business Role Model of the Year for Women in IT, and Mentor and Coach of the Year by the Stevie Business Awards.\n\nHineline joins Chronosphere after 17 years with United Airlines and brings a wealth of cross-functional expertise to his position. Over the last 24 years in the airline industry, he held a variety of leadership roles, ranging from IT operations and engineering to digital marketing. In his last role, he served as Director of Enterprise Observability for United Airlines. As Field CTO, Hineline will serve as a trusted advisor for Chronosphere customers. In his role, he will bridge the gap between business challenges and observability solutions by sharing real-world experience from a customer perspective.\n\nOther executives who will assume new and expanded roles include Ian Smith, who has been appointed Chief of Staff to the CEO and Head of Strategy, following four years as Field CTO and Solutions Engineering lead. Current head of Solution Engineering, Seong Park, will now also lead the Customer Success Engineering and Technical Advisory Management (TAM) team with a promotion to Global Head of Customer Success and Solution Engineering. Prior to Chronosphere, Park led Customer Success organizations at Lacework and ThoughtSpot. Finally, Calyptia Co-Founder Anurag Gupta will become the company’s first Field Architect to help design and implement solutions across telemetry pipeline and observability for Chronosphere’s growing global customer base.",
      "# [Calyptia Buy Completes Chronosphere Observability Trinity by Joab Jackson, Joe Fay, Amanda Brock, David Cassel, Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols, Rak Siva, Manas Chowdhury, Rahul Shrivastava, Mike Elissen, Kevin Wittek on 2024-01-31](https://thenewstack.io/chronospheres-calyptia-buy-completes-observability-trinity/)\nWith its acquisition of Calyptia earlier this month, Chronosphere will have competitive components for all three of the required pillars of a full-fledged observability platform: metrics, traces, and now logs.\n\nCalyptia was built around the open source Fluentd and the associated FluentBit pipeline, two unified logging projects of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. They have become a de facto part of many cloud native stacks, including those run by Oracle, IBM, Microsoft, AWS, and Google.\n\nIn addition to Calyptia’s expertise around the Fluent bits, what made Calyptia appealing was how nicely it fit with Chronosphere’s core values of keeping data costs low for users, said Martin Mao, CEO and co-founder of Chronosphere, in an interview with TNS.\n\n“We’ve historically done that very well on the metric side, and on the tracing side,” Mao explained. “We give you visibility into the explosion of data into what’s causing it and how to fix these things. So it’s not just having these things, but it’s actually having having them cost reliably.”\n\nThe approach is certainly a differentiator when compared to a Chronosphere rival, DataDog, which has been criticized for high customer bills.\n\n(Also to keep observability costs manageable, Chronosphere also recently partnered with Crowdstrike to provide data storage for the Chronosphere platform.)\n\nCalyptia fits into this value proposition comfortably, Mao said. Calyptia had a sharp focus on serving the enterprise, “building out the core pipeline product for the top end of the market,” he said.\n\nThe Three Pillars of Observability\n\nIn the past few years, what used to be known as monitoring has evolved into observability, which offers more tools to understand performance and help in troubleshooting. Observability is usually covered by three components: metrics, tracing and logging.\n\n“Historically, there have been different solutions, and people piece it together themselves, but the industry is moving towards consolidation in a single platform,” Mao said.\n\nChronosphere plans to incorporate Calyptia’s log transformation and optimization capabilities into the company’s own platform.\n\n“With Calyptia, telemetry can be automatically routed to a best-in-class observability solution (such as Chronosphere) for monitoring, to a SIEM platform that helps maintain your security posture, and to integrate disparate systems in cloud native environments,” wrote Eduardo Silva, founder and Fluentd core contributor of Calyptia, and creator of Fluentd, in a blog post.\n\nWhat Is Fluentd?\n\nThe Fluentd is a highly scalable open source log processor, allowing users to collect telemetry from multiple sources and distribute them to analysis and monitoring systems.\n\nBuilt on top of FluentBit is Calyptia’s observability pipeline, enabling the routing, transformation, and optimization of log data at scale. Users can add filters to reduce the amount of data being transferred. Data can also be enriched or redacted, and even analyzed in real time.\n\nThus far, FluentBit has been downloaded 12 billion times. Chronosphere pledges to invest in Fluent projects and community, Mao said.\n\n“Calyptia joining the Chronosphere team is excellent news for everyone who is invested in the future of open source cloud native technology,” said Chris Aniszczyk, CNCF CTO, in a statement on Chronosphere’s blog post.",

While the company itself may not be a household name, Calyptia was founded by the creators of the Fluent Ecosystem, which includes the popular open source observability projects like data collector Fluentd and metrics processor and forwarder Fluent Bit, both of which are part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation’s set of graduated projects.\n\nLike similar startups, Calyptia aimed to turn these projects into paid SaaS products. The team raised a $5 million seed round in 2022, led by Sierra Ventures and Carbide Ventures. Chronosphere and Calyptia did not disclose the price of today’s acquisition, but we’ve seen a lot of similar acquisitions in recent months where well-funded end-to-end platforms like Chronosphere acquire point solutions like Calyptia as enterprises now increasingly look to consolidate their expenses. Just last week, Chronosphere announced a $5 million strategic investment from CrowdStrike at a valuation of $1.6 billion, bringing the company’s total funding to date to almost $350 million.\n\n“With observability data growing by orders of magnitude, companies are ill-equipped to manage the costs and scale of this deluge, forcing their teams to make trade-offs. Teams are especially challenged to handle log data, which is prohibitively expensive to move and store,” said Martin Mao, CEO and co-founder of Chronosphere. “With the addition of Calyptia’s leading observability pipeline solution, we’re taking an important step to ensure that developers have the ultimate control over all their observability data from end to end — including log files to control cost and improve developer productivity.”\n\nWith Calyptia, Chronosphere says, its users will gain an observability pipeline system that they will be able to use to collect, transform and route their metric, log and trace data. This, for example, means that they will now be able to route data from the company’s recently announced log storage and visualization solution (powered by CrowdStrike) to their preferred data back end.\n\nChronosphere also notes that it will continue Calyptia’s engagement with the open source Fluent Ecosystem.\n\n“Calyptia joining the Chronosphere team is excellent news for everyone who is invested in the future of open source cloud native technology,” said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. “In today’s world, anyone that doesn’t adopt open source technology risks being left behind. I’m excited to see how the Fluentd and Fluent Bit projects will continue to grow and evolve as more end users embrace the capabilities of cloud native observability.”",

      "# [Team Archives](https://chronosphere.io/chronaut-culture/team/)\nI joined Chronosphere as an Engineering Manager in January after spending the past five and a half years at Palantir, where I led the observability team. My team was responsible for building and maintaining the infrastructure which enabled our engineers to observe and monitor their systems, debug issues as they occurred, and resolve problems in a timely manner. Our production fleet consisted of hundreds of thousands of pods running at any given point in time. Anybody who’s worked with distributed systems at this scale understands the criticality of good observability tooling: without highly available and reliable monitoring systems, you and the business are flying blind.\n\nChronosphere first appeared on my radar through this previous role, where one of the largest ongoing pain points for my team was managing the metrics usage of other engineering teams in the organization. It was all too easy for a developer to add a line of code which inadvertently blew up their metrics cardinality, and along with it, our observability bill.\n\nWhen I first joined the observability team at Palantir, we relied on in-house tooling built on top of our own data platform to monitor metrics usage on a per-team basis. While partially automated, it still required human intervention to resolve the issues that inevitably surfaced. This solution required an ongoing and active energy investment and failed to effectively “put the pebble in the shoe” of the teams instrumenting their services in an inefficient manner, where the value derived from the metrics was not proportionate with the cost.\n\nMy team built tooling that programmatically dropped low-value metrics, but I was intrigued by the opportunity to build generalized versions of such solutions at Chronosphere. I had a deep understanding of the frustrations experienced as a member of the central observability team. Chronosphere offered capabilities to manage metrics usage out of the box that I’d wished I had on my own team. This stood out to me as a game-changer in a highly competitive observability landscape, and I was convinced that their product would all but sell itself.\n\nConviction in the product seeded my initial interest, and the opportunity to participate in solving organizational problems at a quickly-growing early stage startup sealed the deal. My previous company had over 3,000 employees when I left. Chronosphere had closer to 100 people when I joined this past January and we’ve since doubled in size.\n\nWhile at Palantir, I had an amazing mentor who taught me the characteristics of an effective Engineering Manager over the course of several years. I was frequently outside of my comfort zone and it was a trial by fire at times, but my mentor gave me the tools and coaching I needed to solve hard engineering and leadership problems. The lessons that stuck with me the most were those which were learned through painful failures. However, the growth I experienced during these periods of discomfort was unparalleled. Toward the end of my tenure at the company, the periods of discomfort waned and my own growth tapered. I knew it was time for me to find a place where I could both continue to grow independently and also pass along the lessons and skills that I had learned.\n\nSince starting at Chronosphere, I’ve ramped up on three engineering teams and had an opportunity to apply the same lessons about building well-oiled software development machines in different contexts on a far more condensed timeline. I’ve been exposed to new problems, such as how to foster collaborative relationships between engineering and the field, and how to construct an effective hiring pipeline. However, the most unique set of challenges have come from remote work.\n\nThis was the first time that I joined a company remotely and it presented a unique set of additional challenges. I didn’t fully appreciate how much harder it is to ramp up and feel connected to the broader company in a remote-first environment. You lose out on all of the organic interactions which occur in the office and there isn’t a well-established playbook for how to bridge this gap, particularly at scale. In response to these new challenges, we’re experimenting with creative ways to build a strong culture in our distributed workforce, with efforts ranging from the highly local, such as supporting grassroots team clusters that we see forming in local coworking spaces, to global, such as holding company-wide events in virtual reality. This is at the cutting edge of how we work, and we get to pave the path at Chronosphere. The camaraderie is real.\n\nThe past nine months have gone by in a blur. At the same time, it feels like far more has happened than what deserves to reasonably fit within this timeframe, in the best way possible. I can’t wait to see what the future has in store.\n\nIf any of this resonates with you, there might be a place for you at Chronosphere. Reach out and let’s chat.\n\nIn this Meet the Team profile, we chat with Luke Tillman, located in Denver, Colorado, on what it’s like to be a front-end engineer on the platform team. Luke, who is well-versed in open-sourcing, joined Chronosphere and was actually one of the first hires on the UI team. Catch up on the whole chat with Chris Ward. Below are a few highlights.\n\nWhat do you do at Chronosphere?\n\nI’m a front-end engineer – a UI engineer – on the platform team. So, I work on our cloud product, but on the front end. We have a handful of other folks that also do UI work – they aren’t full-time front-end or UI engineers, but most of the UI folks work on the platform on the cloud.\n\nWhat were some of the reasons you decided to come to Chronosphere?\n\nI was one of the first two UI engineers hired. There were two things. When I started looking at Chronosphere, one aspect that jumped out at me immediately was the chance to work with cool distributed systems tech again. I have a little bit of background there. When I was looking at M3, our open source database that the tech is built around, it reminded me a lot of Cassandra – which is something that I worked with at a previous company.\n\nThe biggest reason that I ended up joining was the people. When I interviewed, everybody was just super kind and empathetic and it was really obvious even in the interview process. It gave me a chance to work with Sterling – the head of our UX who I adore, and we worked together at a previous company. The people are really what drew me and what keeps me around even a year and a half later.\n\nWhat did you do before coming to Chronosphere?\n\nI’ve been in tech for about twenty years now. I guess that dates me. I started out more full-stack, and spent a bunch of time in the . NET space. I wrote a lot of C# in my early days.\n\nI kind of burned out on tech in my twenties, and three years in my late twenties I just quit tech completely. I was a bartender for three years which was actually a lot of fun.\n\nMost recently, I was at a company called DataStax, where I worked on all things Apache Cassandra-related. That was fun.\n\nI also joined DevRel. I was a developer advocate for the first three years. It was something I had never done before. I got to go around and travel, give talks, and teach which I really enjoyed. I eventually went back to engineering full-time.\n\nWhat is the most interesting technical challenge that Chronosphere is solving?\n\nIt has to do with the scale of data that our customers are working with. Working with distributed databases, there’s a certain set of challenges that you don’t have unless you’re working at a bigger scale that some of these technologies solve. When you’re dealing with a huge scale of data, we think about things like: “How do you present a huge volume of data in a meaningful way?” It gets more challenging when you’re dealing with a scale that some of our customers have – or even making sure that things in the front-end perform. And that’s something you don’t get to do at every job.\n\nWhat are you working on right now that you’re most excited about?\n\nI’m on a new dashboard work stream that has been rolling for a little while. I’m doing most of my work right now in an open source project called Perses – where we’re building a dashboarding solution. It’s a lot of fun, and an opportunity to work in open source again. I’m having a good time building dashboarding from scratch.\n\nWhat’s a fun fact about you that nobody would guess?\n\nA friend of mine from grade school moved out here to Denver before I did and really got into the craft brewing scene and wanted to open his own brewery. I got the chance to invest a teeny tiny bit of money, so I own a little bit of a craft brewery here in Denver – called Downhill Brewing.\n\nWhat cool new tool are you trying out that you want to tell everyone about?\n\nThere is this project called Cue Lang. It’s a really interesting way of defining contracts for things – like our configuration of APIs. You can define structures, and get all sorts of validation and code generations for free. It’s a cool little piece of technology that I’ve been playing around with recently.\n\nIf you were an animal, what would you be?\n\nI would be a dog. My wife and I have two and I adore them. I think I would live my best life eating, sleeping and playing. We have two lhasa apsos that have Ewok faces.\n\nWho is someone you’ve considered a role model in your life or career?\n\nI’d say my parents played a huge role at different points and for different reasons. Early on, my Mom is the one who really instilled my work ethic and a love for learning that I still have to this day. She got me reading at a really young age – fiction and things like that. That’s something that I still do every day, before I go to bed.\n\nLater on in life, my dad played a huge role. My Dad’s been a software engineer for about forty years now. He works for Pivotal, in open source projects. He’s been a wealth of knowledge and really helpful at talking through things with me. Tech is a family business for us. My other two brothers have done coding boot camps.\n\nWhat is a quote that you reflect on that motivates you?\n\nI asked my wife this last night. I don’t really have a quote. If I had a quote, it would probably be from a movie. It would have to be “Runaway!!!” from Monty Python, the Holy Grail.\n\nListen in to hear Chris and Luke’s entire conversation:\n\nMore blogs in the Meet the Team series\n\nMeet the Chronosphere team: Mary Fesenko, software engineer\n\nMeet the Chronosphere team: Shreyas Srivatsan, Member of Technical Staff\n\nMeet the Team: Alec Holmes, Member of Technical Staff\n\nMeet the Chronosphere Team: Elenore Bastian, Engineering Manager\n\nMeet the Chronosphere Team: Audrey Bastian, UX Designer\n\nMeet the Chronosphere Team: Ting Chen, Member of Technical Staff\n\nMeet the Chronosphere Team: Brandon Bright, Account Executive\n\nIn today’s Meet the Chronosphere Team profile, we get to know Alex Miljanić, a Senior Sales Development Representative (SDR) who works out of Chronosphere’s New York office. In her role as an SDR, Alex is the first line of contact for many of Chronosphere’s new customers. In this interview with Chris Ward, Alex indulges us with her day-to-day life as a Sales Rep in the observability space, why she joined Chronosphere, and she talks fondly about her brief stint as an English teacher abroad.\n\nWhat do you do at Chronosphere?\n\nAs a Senior Sales Development Representative (SDR) my day-to-day job includes sourcing, tiering new accounts, identifying champions and main point of contacts – I do a lot of the original engagements when we’re trying to break in and identify a good use case fit for our observability platform.\n\nIs this about developing relationships?\n\nYes, I’m the first line of contact for many of the relationships we have/will have with incoming customers. My team will tier out accounts, collect information on their tools and challenges, and plan a strategy for use case tie-ins so we can have introductory conversations and make sure our relationship would be mutually beneficial.\n\nWhat were some of the reasons that you decided to come to Chronosphere?\n\nI came from a competitor. That was my first experience in sales. I really enjoyed observability and open source projects – and how those projects worked from the perspective of the engineers. I always wanted to stay in tech, but I found that my niche was in observability. Understanding how Chronosphere works, how scalable it is, how novel some of our control plane abilities are alongside the aggregation rights – ultimately, it was a decision about how advanced the technology is within the current day market, that’s what drew me in.\n\nWhat did you do before coming to Chronosphere?\n\nI worked in sales at another tech company and I wanted to stay within that space because I found that when you’re talking to engineers, observability is something always being prioritized or on the roadmap for future prioritizations – it’s a stabilizing front for teams understanding how their systems are behaving. If I’m talking to people in big banks, or talking to startups that are just getting their products off the ground – everybody is moving towards microservices, which are complex in nature and especially at scale. To handle microservices architectures, teams need to employ a seamless integration with reliable monitoring tools to track their metrics.\n\nObservability sounds like a buzzword, but whenever I speak to engineers, it doesn’t matter if I’m talking to a VP of engineering or an SRE – when you say observability, describe Chronosphere with one or two sentences, it resonates with everybody. Whether or not it’s a current challenge that the company is facing is another story. But when you bring up the product, it’s something that everybody’s familiar with as being something of critical value\n\nWhat is the most interesting technical challenge that Chronosphere is solving?\n\nThe scalability of microservices and resolving their associated pains. What I’m referring to can present itself in the form of outages and cardinality spikes in the same systems SRE and DevOps teams are actively managing. Chronosphere is particularly positioned in the market to handle these things.\n\nWe have the transparency and the visibility into your data which, now with these microservices becoming popularized and a de facto standard in the market – you’re noticing when you’re having these conversations with engineers, that they are all starting to see issues with the scale. They’re starting to understand that open source projects may not be able to handle the massive volume that they’re managing. So, they either have to hire a ton of engineers to build homegrown systems that can scale better – which costs a lot of money, or defer to SaaS vendors.\n\nSo, the answer to your question is scalability, through and through, which Martin talks about in his blogs and podcasts and Rob writes about in blogs as well.\n\nWhat are you working on right now that you’re excited about?\n\nAt the moment, the team is working around strategically reframing not only what kinds of customers/teams we’re actively targeting, but also planning for the changing secondary and tertiary questions that they’re asking us given their wider experience in resolving the variable issues with their observability stack. OS technologies are fantastic – they’re amongst the most exciting pieces of the tech space for me. Engineers love them, and they love to adopt and configure them. The intersection point is creating a managed system that avoids vendor lock-in by being compatible with Graphite and Prometheus to maintain comfort/familiarity, but can successfully scale and store those metric stacks and reduce management overhead.\n\nWhat’s a fun fact about you that nobody would guess?\n\nThis is actually on my LinkedIn. I worked at a Czech University in Prague as an English teacher for a year with students that were ages 16 to 28. I was 23, but I think they all imagined me as being older just because I was making the decisions in the classroom. A lot of incredibly intelligent exchange students who all had an impressive level of grit leaving their families to live in a different country.\n\nIf you were an animal, what would you be?\n\nI’ll say what other people call me – a llama. I have a friend at Chronosphere that always calls me a llama. I’m a little goofy and I have a really long neck.\n\nWho is someone that you consider a role model and how have they helped guide you in your life or career?\n\nMy Dad got a PhD in computer science from Rutgers University. That’s why both of my parents relocated from Serbia to America. Then war broke out over there and they ended up staying in America. I would say my Dad influenced me both from an academic and professional standpoint. He’s just incredibly hard working, so I’ve had those ideas instilled in me from a very young age. Growing up, becoming an adult – I’ve realized having parents who aren’t just solid parents but are also good people is a real gift. My dad always used to say that when you start speaking too loudly in a discussion, your content becomes less and less relevant. That’s a pretty important point in life; I think you should always be clear. If you operate with distracting behaviors, people will get distracted.\n\nWhat’s a quote you reflect on, you mention to people a lot, or that motivates you?\n\nIt’s kind of corny, but it’s one of Chronosphere’s pillars: “Win together, lose together.” When you’re a part of a cohort, everybody shares the same objective and the responsibility when things are going badly and when things are going well. You just have to stay aligned and share the emotional ups and downs that happen. I think in sales, they happen rather frequently.\n\nListen in to hear Alex and Chris’ entire conversation here:\n\nIn this Meet the Chronosphere Team profile, we chat with Brandon Bright, located in Atlanta, Georgia and who started 2 years ago as the first member of the Chronosphere sales team. Brandon runs us through his day-to-day life as an Account Executive and also shares what inspired him to join the team, how he educates customers about outgrowing open source, why the technical sale is his jam, and the excitement of being a new Dad.\n\nWhat do you do at Chronosphere?\n\nI partner with potential customers on observability and strategy – as well as which customers would be good for Chronosphere and vice versa. I support them through pilot and production. I also spend a lot of time supporting onboarding for new sales team members.\n\nWhat were some of the reasons that you decided to join Chronosphere?\n\nI would categorize the reasons why I joined in four different buckets. The first bucket is the founders. I spent ten-plus hours with (co-founder and CEO) Martin Mao, which was very rare in the interview process. With Martin, I spent time understanding the company vision and talking about what the sales team would look like; the technology; and Uber and M3 (Prior to co-founding Chronosphere, Martin led the observability team at Uber where he and Chronosphere co-founder and CTO, Rob Skillington, created the Prometheus-compatible open source metrics engine, M3).\n\nMartin spent a ton of time with me – I think he was partially evaluating me and also how I would strategically think about the organization. That was huge for me – just knowing that I’m going to a company where the founders are specifically motivated to find and build the right sales team. (Read the backstory about how Chronosphere came to be.)\n\nThe second bucket was the tech. It was obvious that there was a technical advantage with the M3 and Uber story. I didn’t come from (an observability) background, so I had to do a lot of research on it. But from what I found, and from speaking to Martin, Rob, and other people, there’s definitely an advantage to having leaders with their track record in observability.\n\nThe third thing that I always look for in a job is the type of customer that we sell to. I’m big on selling to technical customers. I like the highly technical sale and large-scale problems, so those are things that motivated me to join Chronosphere.\n\nThe fourth bucket was just the market in general – evaluating how much companies spend on observability. Also the fact it’s a business-critical tool and it’s something that everybody needs. So, I think those are the four reasons that made me want to join Chronosphere. (Chronosphere head of sales, Ron DeCanio, talks more about the observability market opportunity here.)\n\nWhat did you do before coming to Chronosphere?\n\nI went to school for Engineering but my first job out of college was tech sales at (semiconductor vendor) Texas Instruments. Two other people and I decided to leave TI and start our own business. We built two mobile applications and a web application for really large events. The goal was to use mesh networks to allow people to connect without service. It gave me the groundwork to do a lot of research on tech and that was helpful in understanding software.\n\nWhat is the most interesting technical challenge that you think Chronosphere is solving?\n\nProviding observability to large scale cloud-native companies is a huge challenge. A lot of the companies that we speak to, especially the big tech companies, only have two options: build it yourself with open source, or use Chronosphere. The other tools that we’ve seen in the market just don’t provide the reliability or availability on top of being cost efficient. After doing a TCO (total cost of ownership) exercise, these organizations see Chronosphere as the only SaaS offering that’s anywhere close to providing the value they need versus the investment being made. That speaks to the differentiators of M3, and the differentiation that [Chronosphere] has built on top of it in our SaaS offering.\n\nOrganizations often underestimate the hidden costs of open source. How do you educate customers about this challenge?\n\nThere is a lot to learn about:\n\nThe cost of building the same functionality you get with Chronosphere.\n\nThe cost of getting to a baseline with the tools you’re using that are open source.\n\nThe cost of training the team and being able to constantly have enough resources.\n\nWe try to help explain all the potential challenges that exist with using open source for your new observability requirements.\n\nWhat are you working on right now that you’re excited about?\n\nMore of a personal response, but my wife and I have been preparing for our first baby girl. A lot of my mental capacity has been preparing for that.\n\nAt work, I am building a training enablement program. With the recent funding and growth on the sales team, we’re hiring a ton of AEs (account executives), SDRs (sales development reps), SEs (sales engineers), and other sales team members. There’s a lot of work that goes into making sure new sales hires are prepared to be successful.\n\nWhat’s a fun fact about you that nobody would guess?\n\nI have never actually read a full book. I’ve tried multiple times. Didn’t do it in college. Didn’t do it in high school. Always found my way around it. Still don’t do it today. I’m usually listening to podcasts or I’ll read an article, but a full book – I just don’t have the capacity to do that.\n\nIf you were an animal, what would you be?\n\nI would be a bird. I have this recurring dream at least once a week where I can fly. I don’t know if I was a bird in a past life – I don’t have a specific one in mind, but that would have to be it.\n\nWho is someone that you consider a role model that has helped guide you in your life and career generally?\n\nMy Dad. He’s in sales as well. He was always around and made time for the family. He has a massive personality and always showed love for family and friends. Definitely the person that I strive to be.\n\nWhat is a quote that motivates you?\n\nI heard one recently from Eliza – a new team member on the recruiting team who said this in the interview process: “I chose this career because it gives me energy – rather than a career that takes energy away.” I’ve reflected on this a lot in my job, and while recruiting other people: figuring out what gives people energy, and what makes them excited.\n\nMore blogs in the Meet the Team series\n\nMeet the Chronosphere team: Mary Fesenko, software engineer\n\nMeet the Chronosphere team: Shreyas Srivatsan, Member of Technical Staff\n\nMeet the Team: Alec Holmes, Member of Technical Staff\n\nMeet the Chronosphere Team: Elenore Bastian, Engineering Manager\n\nMeet the Chronosphere Team: Audrey Bastian, UX Designer\n\nMeet the Chronosphere Team: Ting Chen, Member of Technical Staff\n\nIn today’s Meet the Chronosphere Team profile, we get to know Nate Broyles, one of Chronosphere’s software engineers on the control team and a member of our growing East Coast offices in New York (also our largest location!) In this interview with Chris Ward, Nate delights us with a discussion about his love for sloths and weekend roller-skating, the most interesting technical challenges that Chronosphere is solving today, and what led to him joining Chronosphere over a year ago.\n\nWhat do you do at Chronosphere?\n\nI am a software engineer, part of the technical staff on the control team. We are one of the teams responsible for the ownership of M3 – the core database that powers a lot of what we do here. We specifically focus on ensuring that we have the ability to control users’ access to data and resources. We are able to throw them in without causing any issues for the underlying data source itself. We also educate them on ways to better execute queries or writes so that they get on the golden path.\n\nWhat were some of the reasons that you decided to join Chronosphere?\n\nI had the opportunity to work with Matt Mihic [Chronosphere Head of Engineering] before. I really enjoyed working with him and got to trust his engineering acumen. Having been places before where metrics observability was a huge problem and we had to go through a few different vendors, I knew that what Chronosphere was attempting to solve was a big problem for people and it had a real opportunity. Then, I got to learn the backstory about how Chronoshere came to be. I had the opportunity to meet the co-founders Martin (CEO) and Rob (CTO) and I knew this is what I wanted to do.​​ I didn’t plan on joining a Series B startup, but having all of those factors outlined in front of me made me feel much more comfortable knowing this is a place that is solving a real problem and has the right people in place (Read Martin Mao’s blog about Chronosphere’s recent $200 Series C funding round and how the has achieved unicorn status here.)\n\nWhat did you do before coming to Chronosphere?\n\nI was at Square before. I was there for about 6 ½ years. I learned a ton there – I think it was probably one of the most rewarding jobs I had because it really helped me mature and become a much better engineer. I met some super talented folks, some of whom I am really fortunate enough to work with today. I’m really grateful for that. Matt was my old boss – we were working on CashApp, which is a part of Square.\n\nWhat is the most interesting technical challenge that you think Chronosphere is solving?\n\nI think it’s just the sheer magnitude of data that is coming into the system. Our whole value proposition is, “You can send a ton of data to us, no problem.” We’ll store it and we’ll serve you back, use nice graphs – whatever you want, In whatever kind of timescale you want, in a response time that you’ll find acceptable. That’s very easy to state, but very difficult to actually do. There’s a lot of work that has to go on behind the scenes from the data store itself, being able to just simply handle that volume and that amount of data, all the way up to the front end – being able to properly present that much data. It affects every aspect of what we do here at Chronosphere. The biggest technical challenge is simply what we’ve set out to actually solve – which is handling the sheer amount of volume that our customers send to us.\n\nWhat are you working on right now that you’re really excited about?\n\nWhat I’m currently focusing on right now is getting an integration test framework in place that can spin up the components of M3 and have them be able to talk to each other. We have unit tests in place and what we call “scenario tests” for long running operations, like adding a namespace. But, we don’t really have good integration tests that allow us to do inter-component communications. Like having an aggregator, a DB node, a coordinator spun up – and having them all talk to each other.\n\nWe actually have two iterations of this, but they require Docker containers to be spun up. And then those Docker containers talk to each other – and that’s fine, that works for correctness. But, it really is difficult when you’re trying to iterate and make changes very quickly. You have to rebuild your image and spin up a new Docker container. And then it makes debuggability difficult because you have to attach a remote debugger to a Docker container and that has to be built in a specific way to allow that. But it would be convenient if you could just go to your IDE and you just click run the same way you run a unit test and say: “Hey, I want a new DB node. I want a new aggregator, a new coordinator.” And they all come up and know how to talk to each other – and you can start issuing commands via the public API. That’s what I’m working on tackling right now. And this is really born out of the frustration that several engineers on the M3 team had as we were building out these previous features. I know when people talk about tests, eyes kind of glaze over, but I’m actually really excited about this.\n\nWhat’s a fun fact about you that nobody would guess?\n\nI love roller skating. I grew up next to a skating rink – so I’m actually decent. Fairly often I’ll go to the park and roller skate. I really enjoy it, and it’s having a revival right now. It feels a bit like a vindication because for a long time people thought it was like a dinosaur. But we’re back, so it feels good to be on trend again.\n\nIf you were an animal, what would you be?\n\nI’ve known this answer for a while. The three-toed sloth is one of my favorite animals. It’s just super lazy, and comes down once a week to do its business. Otherwise, it’s just hanging out in the trees and has this little goofy smile on its face all the time. And that’s just the kind of energy that I want to project: taking it easy, having a good time. I’m trying to mosey my way through life. That would be me.\n\nWho is someone that you consider a role model that has helped guide you in your life and career generally?\n\nMy parents. I think the world of them and they really provided a good example of work ethic and moral compass. And just how to try and be the best person you can be. I think my parents really gave me a solid footing. The older I get, the more I realize that not everyone gets that – and I just become more and more appreciative. I’m really, really grateful for what they’ve done and just being there for me and actually giving me the love I think anyone needs as they grow up from a child to an adult.\n\nProfessionally, I’ve just been fortunate to have people in the right place at the right time. I never had a mentor in the traditional sense where it’s the person that I check in with every so often, but I’ve been fortunate enough to meet people…and bounce ideas off of each other and it ends up helping me in the right direction. I don’t think I’ve taken the most direct path to where I am today. So there’s definitely been some missteps. But I do think that generally along the way, I’ve been able to gather really, really good advice that ultimately helped me get into a position that I’m pretty happy with.\n\nWhat’s a quote you reflect on, you mention to people a lot, or that motivates you??\n\nI actually don’t know where it came from, but it’s something that I started saying maybe five or six years ago and now some of my friends know that I say it. It’s never too late to be the person that you want to be. I try to use that to try new things or be a better person the next day, if I feel like I wasn’t great today. I like the idea behind it, where, no matter how old you are, or where you are in life, you can always use the next day to try and do better than the last. I kind of appreciate that.\n\nListen in to hear Chris and Nate’s entire conversation:\n\nMore blogs in the Meet the Team series\n\nMeet the Chronosphere team: Mary Fesenko, software engineer\n\nMeet the Chronosphere team: Shreyas Srivatsan, Member of Technical Staff\n\nMeet the Team: Alec Holmes, Member of Technical Staff\n\nMeet the Chronosphere Team: Elenore Bastian, Engineering Manager\n\nMeet the Chronosphere Team: Audrey Bastian, UX Designer\n\nMeet the Chronosphere Team: Ting Chen, Member of Technical Staff\n\nWhat do you get when you cross a former science teacher with an eternally happy person who loves a hard technical challenge? Meet Audrey. In today’s Meet the Chronosphere Team profile, we get to know Audrey Bastian, a UX designer who is helping Chronosphere give our customers – huge and not-as-huge alike – an excellent observability-team experience. Audrey has been with Chronosphere since March this year. In her interview below with Chris Ward, she talks about why she joined Chronosphere, exciting things she’s working on, what it’s like to be 5’3” and win an all-city fitness challenge, and more.\n\nWhat do you do at Chronosphere?\n\nI’m a UX designer – one of two currently, but our team is growing rapidly. That means I’m designing the product to make it as usable as possible for everyone, whether you are a team member, a manager, or an executive.\n\nWhat were some of the reasons you decided to come to Chronosphere?\n\nMy past experience was mostly working on stuff that wasn’t as technically challenging. When I was looking for my next role, I was looking for something that was super technical and kind of hard. Stuff that’s challenging just makes the day go faster, and I’m constantly – like every day – learning something new here, and it’s really fun to make those connections. I get so much pride and joy when I realize, “This connects to this” and I’m able to piece it all together. That’s a lot of fun. And then also my sister works here! Elenore is the engineering manager, and I feel like we’ve both been in tech for so long, and always thought it would be cool if we worked at the same company. So this has been a really great opportunity and a lot of fun for us … the Chrono-sisters, that’s what we call ourselves. {We recently did a Meet the Team profile on Audrey’s sister, Elenore Bastian, which you can read here.}\n\nWhat did you do before coming to Chronosphere?\n\nI’ve had a couple of different positions. The one most recently was working in media. I was designing how someone might program different TV shows to go on the air. It was cool. I worked in healthcare for a little bit, designing different products for health applications. I also worked at Microsoft. Prior to all of that, I taught eighth grade science on the South Side of Chicago. I made a big career switch.\n\nWhat is the most interesting technical challenge Chronosphere is solving?\n\nThe most interesting technical challenge I face is: How do you scale a product to fit so many different companies? We have customers that are massive, and have thousands of employees, and some that are much smaller. How do you create a product that’s intuitive for all of these different users? And make sure everyone understands all the things that the product does? And make sure they are all able to turn on the features that they need, or ignore the features that they don’t? How do we make a product that works for all groups? That’s definitely been a big challenge.\n\nWhat are you working on right now that you’re excited about?\n\nI’m part of the new Info Model team. It’s very small right now – there are just a couple of us. The Info Model team is essentially restructuring the product to better match users’ environments. Our users tend to think of themselves as teams, so how do we make our product more team-friendly? When you log into the product, how do you only see the things that are pertinent to you? That’s the new challenge I’m tackling. It’s very much like architecture, where you’re figuring out where everything fits in and how permissions work. We’re still very much in the early stages, and narrowing down exactly how we want it to look and feel, and what pieces need to be included.\n\nBefore the Info Model team, I was on the Foundations team and was working on a project that leads into this – users and teams, which is how users access the system, how do you set up a team, and now we’re getting into, what the team sees once it’s set up.\n\nWhat’s a fun fact about you that nobody would guess?\n\nI think I’m oddly strong for how small I am. I’m not very tall, but I recently won an all-city fitness competition, which I’m very proud of. Another fun fact is I’ve gotten to wear the Clippy suit. It’s in the Microsoft archives and I got to wear it once.\n\nWhat stickers are on your laptop?\n\nI actually don’t have any. I used to when I was a teacher. I was obsessed with stickers, and I had them all over my water bottle. One time my student dropped my water bottle and it bent in a way that I couldn’t use it anymore. I was devastated because I had taken so much time to collect and stick each one in a nice way. So now I can’t do it again. I get too attached, so no more stickers.\n\nIf you were an animal, what would you be?\n\nThis seems so basic, but I feel like I’d be a dog. I’m easily excited about stuff. I’m pretty much always in a good mood and pretty happy. I like being around people, which I think is true for most dogs. So maybe a dog, or a puppy – something that likes to play.\n\nWho is someone you have considered a role model and how have they helped guide you in your life or career?\n\nDefinitely my parents. From an early age, they taught my sister and me about perseverance and how to be confident and work hard and grit. They also exposed us to so many opportunities at a young age that I’m really appreciative of. More recently, I also think of my sister as a role model. It’s been so interesting working with her, and seeing this new perspective where she’s not just my younger sister anymore. She has a career and is respected by her peers, and it’s fun to see her really own her job and do so well.\n\nWhat’s a quote you reflect on, you mention to people a lot, or that motivates you?\n\nIt’s one that my mom said ever since my sister (Elenore) and I were so young and it’s from Eleanor Roosevelt: “No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.” As a young kid, it definitely was true. Like when you aren’t wearing the coolest clothes, or you just don’t feel as cool – as long as I’m confident in myself, nothing else matters. And now, as I’ve grown older, it’s also true. I did this big career change, and so sometimes I don’t necessarily feel like I’m the best UX designer, or that I know the most. But as long as I’m confident in myself, and as long as I put in my best effort, I can always do the best job.\n\nListen in to hear Audrey’s and Chris’ full conversation:\n\nMore blogs in the Meet the Team series\n\nMeet the Chronosphere team: Mary Fesenko, software engineer\n\nMeet the Chronosphere team: Shreyas Srivatsan, Member of Technical Staff\n\nMeet the Team: Alec Holmes, Member of Technical Staff\n\nMeet the Chronosphere Team: Elenore Bastian, Engineering Manager\n\nMeet the Chronosphere Team: Nate Broyles, Member of Technical Staff\n\nMeet the Chronosphere Team: Ting Chen, Member of Technical Staff\n\nIn today’s Meet the Chronosphere Team profile, we pivot to the hardworking front-end team. Ting Chen is a UI engineer who joined Chronosphere’s New York crew (also our largest) less than five months ago. As a developer who has been on-call, Ting brings first-hand experience to his work on new distributed tracing capabilities Chronosphere just added to our observability platform. After reading (or listening to) the interview below, you’ll find out how a UI engineer like Ting is a product of many interesting parts – whether it’s enjoying a technical challenge in his work, being a foodie, admiring the beauty of art, or drawing from the inspiration his family has provided.\n\nWhat do you do at Chronosphere?\n\nI’m a UI engineer on the platform team. I’ve had the opportunity to work on a range of features for our web app such as building a standalone site for our documentation, a dashboard to manage the user permissions, and also visualization for our new tracing feature.\n\nWhat were some of the reasons you decided to come to Chronosphere?\n\nFor quite some time, I’ve wanted to work at a startup company. However, I’ve also been pretty picky with the startups that I want to join since I’ve seen a lot of them struggle for years before finally simmering out. I got excited with Chronosphere because it popped into my radar from two separate instances; first at work while I was at DoorDash – our teams suddenly got shifted to prioritize integrating Chronosphere – then from a friend who decided after many years to leave Square to join Chronosphere. After speaking to my friend, he told me all about the team and the mission. I found out that Chronosphere was only a series B company and got the business of a client as big as DoorDash; I felt like they were doing something right. The more I learned about Chronosphere’s team, the more I wanted to join. It was a small company where I could make a large impact, but it was also a team that was composed of brilliant senior developers from top companies like Uber, Square, and Pivotal. When I joined, it became clear to me that these engineers laid the foundation for a great company, bringing all the best coding practices and processes together in order to make an awesome observability product.\n\nWhat did you do before coming to Chronosphere?\n\nI was building food delivery apps at Caviar and then after we got acquired, at DoorDash.\n\nWhat is the most interesting technical challenge Chronosphere is solving?\n\nI think the most interesting/fun technical challenge is in data visualization. Not only is it a pretty new space for me, but I think it’s interesting to take all the data we have and present it in a way that’s easily understandable to our end users. That’s part of the UI challenge – to take complex data and simplify it. In addition, there are some cool scaling and data ingestion challenges on the backend side that we also need to handle on the frontend. I’m not working on that personally, but there’s just so much complexity over there. Honestly, it’s hard to get my head wrapped around. While building our dashboards, we need to think about how we present all the data we have in a performant way, without oversimplifying our data to a point where it’s not really useful to people anymore.\n\nWhat are you working on right now that you’re excited about?\n\nI’m excited about the tracing project that we’re building. Having been on-call in the past, it’s important to be able to triage the issue as quickly as possible, and I think tracing is one of those features that will really help with that. And as I mentioned earlier, this has some cool visualization challenges; based on the data we’ve collected, how can we present the data in a way that would allow an engineer to quickly identify the issue from a glance? We’re looking at different solutions, such as D3, Visx, and Apache ECharts libraries, for providing the visualization – whether that’s a directed graph or a sankey diagram – that would, just by opening the page, allow the engineer to immediately identify the problem.\n\nWhat’s a fun fact about you that nobody would guess?\n\nMaybe it’s not too far-fetched since I am a UI engineer, but up till I was headed to college, my main passion was drawing and painting and I wanted to be an artist. I had even gotten into art school and planned on doing a dual degree in engineering and art, but quickly realized there was no way to do both without sacrificing all my sleep. I chose to do engineering instead.\n\nWhat stickers are on your laptop?\n\nI don’t like putting stickers on my laptop. I consider myself to be a minimalist and I think there’s beauty to the construction of the laptop that would be ruined by slapping on a sticker. Similar to bumper stickers on cars, it sends all kinds of confusing messages, especially when the purchased product was meant to be sleek and simple.\n\nIf you were an animal, what would you be?\n\nI’d probably be a panda. They seem like super chill animals that love to eat. I can resonate with that.\n\nWho is someone you have considered a role model and how have they helped guide you in your life or career?\n\nThroughout my life, I’ve considered different people role models. I’m fortunate to have two older brothers I could observe to determine what to do and what behaviors to avoid (at school and around my parents). Later on in my career, taking that same mentality, I sought mentors who could also share with me their successes and failures so that I could learn from them.\n\nAs for celebrity role models, Hayao Miyazaki has always been an inspiration to me for his attention to detail to the subtleties of often overlooked beauty in art.\n\nFinally, I’ve always considered my parents my longest running role models. They sacrificed a ton to immigrate to the US and they’re both blue collar workers that have had multiple jobs to give us a good life in the states. I’m motivated to work hard to give them an easier life as they have done for me.\n\nWhat’s a quote you reflect on, you mention to people a lot, or that motivates you?\n\nA quote that motivates me is, “You don’t have to be great to get started, but you have to get started to be great.” This probably falls in the same vein of, “A large task can be very daunting until you break it down into smaller pieces.” Data visualization is something that I’m not an expert at, but I’m confident that as long as I get started and learn something new everyday, I’m going to become pretty proficient at a cool new skill.\n\n~~~\n\nStay tuned for more profiles on Chronospherians and check out our open roles here.\n\nListen in to hear Ting’s and Chris Ward’s full conversation:\n\nMore blogs in the Meet the Team series\n\nMeet the Chronosphere team: Mary Fesenko, software engineer\n\nMeet the Chronosphere team: Shreyas Srivatsan, Member of Technical Staff\n\nMeet the Team: Alec Holmes, Member of Technical Staff\n\nMeet the Chronosphere Team: Elenore Bastian, Engineering Manager\n\nMeet the Chronosphere Team: Nate Broyles, Member of Technical Staff\n\nMeet the Chronosphere Team: Audrey Bastian, UX Designer\n\nIn today’s Meet the Chronosphere Team profile, we hand the microphone to Elenore who manages the Platform team … and who unflinchingly responded with “people” and “learning opportunity” when asked why she joined Chronosphere. Culture-building is a key component of Chronosphere’s values and we’re thrilled to have a people-person like Elenore on our engineering team. During her 10 months at Chronosphere, Elenore has gotten ramped up on the world of monitoring, observability, and metrics! Elenore joins our interview from her location on the West Coast and shares fun insights about life at Chronosphere.\n\nWhat do you do at Chronosphere?\n\nI’m the manager for the Platform team, and the Platform team is everything to do with how users interact with the product. It’s the UI (user interface) – the front end – as well as behind the scenes stuff like the API and the CLI and all the components we integrate with.\n\nWhat were some of the reasons you decided to come to Chronosphere?\n\nThe people, one hundred percent. I could tell the team was committed to ramping everybody up, to investing in each other – I’m brand new to monitors, observability, metrics, and that whole world and Chronosphere felt like a safe space to learn.\n\nWhat did you do before coming to Chronosphere?\n\nI was at a company called Pivotal for a long time, and Pivotal got acquired by VMware. So I was at VMware for a little bit and I just wasn’t into it – so I hopped over to Chronosphere.\n\nWhat is the most interesting challenge Chronosphere is solving?\n\nI think a big challenge we’re facing right now – which isn’t super technical but it’s something I think about a lot – is thinking about our product as a whole across all the touch points. How do we present Chronosphere’s ✨vibe✨ to our customers? How are they interacting with the UI and the CLI, and how do we make those interactions seamless and consistent?\n\nWhat are you working on right now that you’re excited about?\n\nI’ve just collected a bunch of peer feedback for all of my reports and I’m really excited to write that up and share it out – it was all really positive and I’m really excited to start building feedback as a habit and not as a chore. I’m hoping to show peer feedback is beneficial, productive, easy – not scary, or an overhead of process. I want the engineers to be giving feedback to each other all the time, but one thing that makes that really hard is being remote, and the pandemic, and not all knowing each other, and not all being in the office. It just comes less naturally, so I’m trying to think of better ways for us to have those organic conversations.\n\nSometimes it’s hard to hear feedback, so I wanted people to come up with ideas or growth goals for themselves. Like, “I want to be a better leader on my team by making sure I share the right amount of context and information.” I’m asking very pointed questions around specific goals, and that’s been helpful in that people are picking out what they want feedback on – essentially taking ownership over their growth.\n\nWhat’s a fun fact about you that nobody would guess?\n\nWhen I was 18 and a senior in high school, I won a pageant. It had all the pageant things like a big dress and a tiara. It’s a very small town thing.\n\nWhat stickers are on your laptop?\n\nI have a Pacific Northwest Native American totem pole. And I have a sticker of my cat, Owen.\n\nIf you were an animal, what would you be?\n\nI would be an alien. Or Sasquatch. I love conspiracy theories, so I would pick something like that.\n\nWho is someone you have considered a role model and how have they helped guide you in your life or career?\n\nMy parents. Both my parents are in positions of leadership – they’re both judges. For my mom, as a female judge, I think you just get more flack, more scrutiny, than your male counterparts – like you can get as a woman in tech. You can bottle up some of that frustration and anger and have that control your life. But you can also just let it go. I’ve been learning how to do that over the years. My dad’s also a judge, and he is very thoughtful. Being thoughtful and empathetic is helpful as a manager, and in software in general!\n\nWhat’s a quote you reflect on, you mention to people a lot, or that motivates you?\n\nAt work, every problem is a communication problem – pretty much always. So if people are having problems, I ask, “How can we communicate better? Where are the gaps in communication?”\n\n~~~\n\nStay tuned for more profiles on Chronospherians and check out our open roles here.

In today’s “Meet the Chronosphere Team” profile, you’ll get to know Alec Holmes, a critical member of our growing West Coast Team. Alec joined the team almost a year ago, and in this piece, he tells us about his career in software development, what drew him to Chronosphere, and what inspires him.\n\nWhat do you do at Chronosphere?\n\nI work in engineering, and because of the nature of startups, I tend to jump around a little bit. My primary focus, however, is centered around the part of our product that is helping customers track the health of their various systems. Lately this involves refining how customers manage their alerting configuration and how they build out various systems to support that. This ends up touching on a couple of different areas of the product. Some of my time is spent just sitting at my keyboard and coding, but I also spend a fair amount of time collaborating with others on ideas and architecture.\n\nWhat were some of the reasons you decided to join Chronosphere?\n\nThere are quite a few lists of reasons, so I’ll narrow it down a little bit. One of the really big ones for me is the team of people that I’m working with. I’ve always found that I’m happiest when I’m working in a team of people that are all very collaborative and supportive and working in sync. That’s something that I’ve found at Chronosphere. And what drew me in is – I knew a couple of people to start with, and then as I went through the interview process and met various people in various roles, I really liked the people I met and I had a really good feeling. I just want to work with really great people who will help me learn. Beyond the team is what we’re building here. It is something I’ve always been interested in and felt is pretty important. In past roles, I’ve worked in areas that have used observability platforms and I’ve never been quite satisfied. For me, when Chronosphere came along, it felt like the right time to join something early enough where you can really help shape what we’re doing. That was very compelling.\n\nWhat did you do before coming to Chronosphere?\n\nThe last thing that I was working on prior to Chronosphere was at the FinTech company, Square. I was there for about eight-and-a half years. I was kind of lucky because it was such a long time, and the company grew a lot during that time, so I was able to touch on a couple of different parts of the business. I started off working on their payments infrastructure – working on the systems that process credit card payments and make sure that the small merchants they support get paid every day. I also worked on their public developer API platform. The last stretch there was working for the Cash App part of the business. I was helping build their cloud infrastructure. It turns out that last stint on the Cash App ended up leading to my work at Chronosphere. A lot of the platform work we were doing there, and a lot of the problems we were trying to deal with, are the ones that Chronosphere is solving.\n\nWhat is the most interesting technical challenge Chronosphere is solving?\n\nWe talk a lot about scaling metrics and scaling the metric storage engine. That’s an extremely interesting problem, but I actually don’t work that much on those types of problems at Chronosphere. The ones I’m really interested in solving right now are scalability in two aspects around what we internally call “triage”, which is helping customers understand, quickly, when something is going wrong in their systems and helping them mitigate it.\n\nOne problem, which isn’t immediately technical, is that the customers we tend to target are quite large and have sprawling organizational structures. When these companies are trying to define alerting configuration, it’s not one small group of people doing it. It’s hundreds or thousands of people across many different business lines. The first challenge that we’ve had to start facing is – when there’s all this information they need to model in the observability space, how can we represent it for them so they can navigate it very naturally and not be overwhelmed by the sheer number of things that they’re looking at? When we’re designing some of our newer observability systems, we’ve had to really think about what concepts will make this natural to scale from a small customer to a large customer. From a conceptual model, that’s been very interesting.\n\nOn a more technical side, this all comes with challenges on the backend as well. If you’re a customer and you have thousands, or tens of thousands, of constantly executing alerts, we want to ensure those are running smoothly, they execute on time, and the data that’s coming back is correct and usable. Part of the challenge of building out the backend for easily navigable alert structures is that you want it to be fast and reliable and snappy, and that technically can be quite challenging to build.\n\nWhat are you working on right now that you’re excited about?\n\nWhat I’m mainly working on right now is rolling out a pretty significant revamp of how we let customers manage their alerting. We’re moving towards a model that’s more flexible and allows a lot more reusability around the parameters people define. One of the first things that I started on when I joined here was actually working with the head of product and head of design to step back and think about what are the important concepts we need to think about. We gradually worked from there to build out a model, and then from there to build out a pretty huge change to the backend to support this. It’s been months in the making and we are just starting to roll it out now. There’s excitement in seeing something you’ve been working on finally come to fruition, and seeing it in the hands of the customers actually using it.\n\nWhat’s a fun fact about you that nobody would guess?\n\nOne fun fact is I spent most of my childhood growing up in the suburbs outside of New York City, which is probably something anyone could guess. But the fun fact aspect of it is, for five years, when I was a teenager, I lived with my family in Tokyo, which was pretty amazing. I was very lucky as a kid to be able to run around this huge city with free rein. I was definitely very disappointed to move back and then not have a drivers licence and be stuck in the woods.\n\nWhat stickers are on your laptop?\n\nI am admittedly not much of a sticker person, so I don’t have any stickers on my laptops. I do have one single fridge magnet, which is an Eskimo holding a snow cone that I got in Iceland, but nothing on my laptop. I think if I were pressed, and had to put a sticker on, there’s a coffee shop around here I really like, called Andytown. I do notice when I buy my coffee at the register, they have a lot of very adorable stickers of birds holding coffee cups and things like that. I think that would probably be the first sticker to come.\n\nIf you were an animal, what would you be?\n\nThis is probably the opposite of the fun fact question in that everyone would guess it, at least people who know me and work with me: I would be a cat. For those who know me, I am a cat enthusiast. But beyond that, I think they have a good life. They spend half the time exploring and just kind of roaming around and learning new things, seeing new things. And the other half they’re just lounging and enjoying life.\n\nWho is someone you have considered a role model and how have they helped guide you in your life or career?\n\nI’m one of those people that has the mentality of “it takes a village,” so there might not be one singular person, but there’s certainly a lot of people over time. To give a few examples, when I was a kid in middle school, I was very lucky in that I had a teacher there who ran the computer lab, who basically saw that I liked computer things. And was not only very encouraging, but gave me books on programming and showed me the ropes a little bit. That was probably the first example of someone who really recognized what I liked and helped me learn how to explore that.\n\nWhen it comes to my career now, and where I’ve been going the past few years, it was during my time at Square that I was really able to mature a lot as an engineer. And I credit that with that company – just having a lot of very bright, very thoughtful people. When I was there, I had a bunch of leads that were very thoughtful about helping me plan my career path and giving me really good feedback – that went a really long way. Beyond that, I’ve also throughout my career become friends with a lot of peers I’ve worked with. What that’s ended up being for me is having not only friends, but a social support network where we all act as sounding boards to sometimes talk about very deep-in-the-weeds, technical things, and sometimes talk about the long arc of where we want to go as software engineers.\n\nWhat’s a quote you reflect on, you mention to people a lot, or that motivates you?\n\nThere is one quote I’ve always really enjoyed. It’s from James Baldwin, and the quote is, “Not everything that is faced can be changed. But nothing can be changed until it is faced.” I like the quote because I think life in general is full of challenges at various levels – some are personal, some are community, and some are global. I think it’s a good reminder that even when problems are huge, and sometimes feel almost insurmountable, that you can never make any progress until you just take that first step. It’s a quote I like that passes through my mind from time to time.\n\nIt’s always fun to hear someone in their own words.

      "# [Chronosphere Rapidly Scaling Observability Platform on Google Cloud on 2024-04-09](https://chronosphere.io/news/google-next-24-partnership/)\nLas Vegas, April 9, 2024 — Chronosphere, the leading observability platform provider for cloud-native services and a Google Cloud Premier Partner, today announced at Google Cloud Next ‘24 that it is one of the fastest growing monitoring and observability offerings hosted on Google Cloud. The observability leader also revealed today a new integration with Google Cloud’s Personalized Service Health (PSH).\n\nChronosphere partnered with Google Cloud to bring together the best in cloud native services and cloud native observability to hyper growth organizations. Teams can transform their observability data based on need, context, and utility—all delivered on Google Cloud. With Chronosphere, teams can store only the useful data to reduce cost and improve performance, gaining faster issue detection and resolution, up to 99.99% availability and open source compatibility–eliminating vendor lock-in.\n\n“In just a year since forming our partnership, the demand from our joint customers such as Mixpanel and Dandy underscores the momentum towards a cloud native future,” said Martin Mao, CEO and co-founder of Chronosphere. “Being a Google Cloud Premier Partner accelerates our ability to deliver this future to a broader group of customers, yielding impactful results that bolster their bottom lines.”\n\n“Thanks to Chronosphere and Google Cloud, we can confidently scale while controlling data costs and delivering a fast and reliable patient experience,” Jack Pierce, senior engineer at Dandy, the leading digital dental company. “Working with Kubernetes and Cloud Native industry leaders gives us the confidence to reach our company’s mission of providing dentists with the industry’s most trusted digital dental operating system.”\n\n“We saw immediate value in Chronosphere’s new Google Cloud Personalized Service Health integration. Having highly relevant incidents impacting the Google Cloud products we rely on overlayed in our most critical dashboards saves a lot of time. It’s great to see Chronosphere and Google Cloud working together so closely!” Austin Pray, Staff TLM in charge of the DevInfra team at Mixpanel.\n\nThe new Google Cloud Personalized Service Health integration enables customers to ingest events impacting Google Cloud product and services relevant to their projects into Chronosphere. These events identify when infrastructure changes occurred, providing responders with more information to help them better understand the full story related to the alerts and time series anomalies they are seeing. This enables engineers to respond to an issue quickly, reducing developer toil and improving their situational awareness during an incident.\n\n“Google Cloud Personalized Service Health (PSH) helps customers gain visibility into events impacting the Google Cloud products they use,” said Ritika Suri, Director of Technology Partnerships, Google Cloud. “Now, customers can natively create incident workflows from PSH that get triggered directly to the customer side, such as automated opening of tickets, sending alerts, etc, helping engineers be more effective and productive.”",
      "# [Chronosphere aims to help companies harness an 'explosion of data' from AI and cloud technologies by Devony Hof, JAMES FARRELL, MIKE WHEATLEY, MARIA DEUTSCHER, DUNCAN RILEY on 2023-11-13](https://siliconangle.com/2023/11/13/chronosphere-aims-to-help-companies-harness-an-explosion-of-data-from-ai-and-cloud-technologies-kubeconna/)\nAs developments in artificial intelligence and kubernetes technology fuel industry-wide transformations, tracking the performance of AI models and cloud applications is vital.\n\n“From an observability perspective, a lot of customers [are] obviously themselves experimenting with … generative AI, even building their own large language models, and so, they want to observe those workloads,” said Ian Smith (pictured), field chief technology officer of Chronosphere Inc.\n\nSmith spoke with theCUBE industry analysts Savannah Peterson and John Furrier at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. They discussed the impact of AI and Kubernetes on observability and the importance of open telemetry to a company’s data strategy. (* Disclosure below.)\n\nFinding an observability strategy\n\nWith tools such as OpenTelemetry, a framework for capturing metrics and logs from cloud-native applications, Chronosphere offers customers greater flexibility for data analysis.\n\n“OpenTelemetry … allows you to own your data and do things that you couldn’t do when you were sort of single vendor before,” said Smith, who likens advancements in AI to GraphQL, a data query and manipulation language. Both created a “massive explosion of data” that required detailed observability.\n\nWhen it comes to observing the data from large language models and an increasingly complex architecture of cloud services, it’s not as simple as finding the right vendor, argues Smith.\n\n“It’s a double-edged sword,” he said, “Observability strategy no longer can be just tool selection. And so, there’s a lot of choice out there, and I don’t think there are some hard and fast rules, but I think you really have to look at it through the lens of how does my tool selection feed into my observability strategy?”\n\nThe ratio of cost to value is a priority for crafting one’s strategy, highlights Smith. Instead of trying to “spend money infinitely,” companies should focus on how these observations serve their business.\n\nAs companies enter an era of AI and cloud-native innovations, being able to own their data and establish a concrete observability strategy is crucial, believes Smith. “They can be empowered. [Their] limited resources can be used more effectively.”\n\nHere’s the complete video interview, part of SiliconANGLE’s and theCUBE’s coverage of KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA:\n\n(* Disclosure: Chronosphere Inc. sponsored this segment of theCUBE.

In addition to being named a Leader in this report, Chronosphere was also recognized as A Strong Performer in the 2023 Gartner Peer Insights™ Voice of the Customer report for the Application Performance Monitoring and Observability category. The Voice of the Customer report, which is based on aggregated reviews of users and decision makers, recognized Chronosphere as a Strong Performer with the highest overall rating among all recognized vendors with an overall 4.7 out of 5 score based on 27 total reviews as of 31 October 2023.\n\nChronosphere’s product portfolio includes both its Observability Platform and its recently re-launched Telemetry Pipeline (formerly Calyptia).
