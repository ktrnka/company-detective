      "# [Cloud Observability Solutions on 2023-08-10](https://chronosphere.io/solutions/)\nInfrastructure metrics are the backbone of your observability implementation. This is especially true in a cloud native infrastructure environment. With an efficient cloud infrastructure monitoring solution that was purpose-built to reliably handle the scale of cloud native, you will know about issues before your customers do.\n\nChronosphere ingests a variety of open source infrastructure metrics formats from Prometheus to Graphite/StatsD and ships with out of the box dashboards like cAdvisor that give you instant insight into your Kubernetes clusters making Kubernetes monitoring easy.\n\nWith Prometheus, you can export infrastructure metrics from virtually any server, database, or service mesh. Monitoring infrastructure is a foundational to your observability strategy.\n\nApplication performance monitoring (APM,) or the task of troubleshooting application errors or performance issues, is no easy feat in a distributed microservices environment. With Chronosphere, engineers of any experience level can understand the root cause of issues via the insights provided by the automated analysis of the underlying Observability data.\n\nHarnessing the power of distributed tracing via OpenTelemetry, your tangled mess of microservices goes from unintelligible to understandable. The results? Fewer incidents, faster resolution, happier customers and developers thanks to the power of cloud native application monitoring.\n\nWhen your business moves at the speed of cloud, you can’t wait hours or days to understand business impact. With Chronosphere’s millisecond ingest and one second alert intervals, you can react to business metrics like revenue flow and customer engagement in seconds.\n\nWith a single solution that can connect infrastructure errors through to application performance all the way up to business impacts, you always have a 360 degree view of your business performance.\n\nCloud native environments produce massive amounts of telemetry data. Developers need this data to effectively operate and troubleshoot systems, but it quickly leads to observability costs spiraling out of control.\n\nWith Chronosphere, you still collect all the same data, but it’s aggregated and transformed into actionable insight that is usable for developers, while also being highly cost efficient. The result is greater predictability, increased accountability, and significant cost savings.\n\nWhen customer-facing issues arise, your developers need the best tools to solve these issues, fast. Chronosphere rapidly orients developers to the problem at hand with context-rich alerts and seamless linking of data types for faster time to triage. With a solution that is accessible for all levels of developers, you will no longer have your most senior resources pulled into every incident response.\n\nThe results? When you can scale reliably and meet customer demand, you’ll see increased revenue and less customer churn.\n\nWhen your observability solution is unreliable, the entire organization suffers. Developers can’t ship code, or worse, fly blind during an outage. They spend longer on troubleshooting, which means they are slower to deliver new features, which in turn frustrates customers and puts revenue at risk.\n\nWith Chronosphere, you gain an observability platform that is reliable, scalable, and performant, so engineers spend less time in the weeds and more time innovating\n\nWhile many organizations begin their cloud native observability journey with open source tools like Prometheus or Jaeger, they quickly run into major hurdles. The two big challenges that companies face when running their own open source observability in-house is the significant management overhead and tooling that is unreliable and slow.\n\nWith Chronosphere, you get the best of both worlds: a fully open source compatible solution that relieves the management overview and delivers best in class availability and performance.

      "# [Overview of alerting](https://docs.chronosphere.io/alerts)\nOne reason to ingest and store time series data is to know when data does or doesn't meet certain criteria. To generate alerts and notifications from data, regardless of whether it's about your system or about your use of Chronosphere Observability Platform itself, use alerting.\n\nYou create monitors to query time series, and optionally group results into signals. Whenever a time series meets a condition, an alert triggers that sends a notification. You can mute notifications with muting rules.\n\nMonitors\n\nObservability Platform alerting revolves around monitors. You can watch time series data that's specified in a monitor query. The results of a monitor query can be time series data or the outcome of a function applied to time series data. Because Observability Platform is a single data store, you can merge alerts, which lets an alert query all metrics and not only metrics local to a Prometheus instance.\n\nConditions\n\nConditions are evaluations run against every time series from the resulting monitor query, along with a related severity, such as critical or warning. For example, conditions can help you determine if a time series value remains greater than 1 for more than 30 seconds. If this happens, Observability Platform can display a warning alert.\n\nYou can also specify condition overrides to override the default conditions that define when an alert triggers for a monitor.\n\nSignals\n\nSignals are optional groupings by label of the results returned from a monitor query. For example, you can use signals to group time series from multiple environments, such as development or production, to generate separate alerts for each environment.\n\nIn Observability Platform, on the Monitors page, monitors with defined signals display the file tree icon. To view the signals from a displayed monitor, click the name of the monitor from the list.\n\nObservability Platform supports converting from Prometheus alerts to signals, and strongly recommends using signals instead of configuring complex routing trees to route notifications:\n\nYou can configure signals for individual monitors, which isolates changes to only that monitor. Prometheus requires a single global configuration, and any change impacts users across your entire organization.\n\nSignals let you group notifications within the monitor itself, rather than grouping notifications within the notification routing tree. This model makes signals easier to manage as part of a monitor configuration.\n\nAlerts\n\nAlerts occur when one or more monitor query results trigger a condition. Configuring the monitor signal to group query results generates an alert for each signal that triggers a condition.\n\nNotifications\n\nWhen an alert triggers, and optionally when an alert resolves, Observability Platform sends a notification to specified endpoints called notifiers, including PagerDuty, email, and Slack. You configure your notifications with notification policies.\n\nMuting rules\n\nUsing Observability Platform, you can temporarily mute notifications for a triggered alert. These muting rules can apply to:",

These metrics have consistent reporting intervals.\n\nPush models, like tracing, send data to Chronosphere, which is then processed. These metrics can have a broad spectrum of reporting frequency, from large bursts of data to long periods with no data reporting.\n\nTelemetryPushPullMetricsTracesLogs\n\nThe ingestion model depends on the data source. Metrics pushed to Observability Platform can have latency delays or sparse time series which can result in unexpected query results.\n\nMetric and trace data\n\nTo ingest metrics and traces, you must configure one of the collection methods. Use the Chronosphere Collector or OpenTelemetry Collector for metric and trace data. Google Cloud metrics can also be directly ingested.\n\nChange event data\n\nChange event data gets sent directly to Observability Platform, and doesn't require an independent collection mechanism. Use Observability Platform or CreateEvent API to send your change events (opens in a new tab).\n\nYou can also ingest change events directly from supported third-party tools such as Amazon EventBridge, Buildkite, and LaunchDarkly.\n\nLog data\n\nTo ingest log data, Chronosphere recommends using Core Agent or a combination of Core Agent plus Telemetry Pipeline. Chronosphere also supports using your existing ingest pipeline to ingest log data, such as Fluent Bit or LogStash. You can also ingest log data using the OpenTelemetry Collector.\n\nControl costs\n\nIngesting more telemetry data increases your overall data and storage costs.

Slugs are case-sensitive. By default, Observability Platform generates a random slug (containing less than 255 characters) for each resource. Chronoctl lets you optionally specify a slug when creating resources.\n\nConfiguration commands\n\nConfiguration commands are the recommended way to interact with Observability Platform resources. Use the apply command for interacting with multiple resources, but in most cases, uses the configuration commands.\n\nEach of these commands are specific to Observability Platform resource types, which have the same following subcommands:\n\ncreate\n\ndelete\n\nlist\n\nread\n\nscaffold\n\nupdate\n\ncreate\n\nCreates one resource of the given type. For example:\n\nReplace the following:\n\nRESOURCE: The resource you want to take action on.\n\nFILE_NAME: The name of the definition file you want to use.\n\nFor more information about the subcommand, including its usage and accepted flags, see the Chronoctl command line help.\n\nReplace RESOURCE with the resource you want to take action on.\n\ndelete\n\nDeletes one resource of the given type. For example:\n\nReplace the following:\n\nRESOURCE: The resource you want to take action on.\n\nSLUG: The slug of the resource you want to delete.\n\nFor more information about the subcommand, including its usage and accepted flags, see the Chronoctl command line help.\n\nReplace RESOURCE with the resource you want to take action on.\n\nlist\n\nLists all resources of the given type. For example:\n\nReplace RESOURCE with the resource you want to take action on.\n\nFor more information about the subcommand, including its usage and accepted flags, see the Chronoctl command line help.\n\nReplace RESOURCE with the resource you want to take action on.\n\nread\n\nOutputs one resource of the given type. For example:\n\nReplace the following:\n\nRESOURCE: The resource you want to take action on.\n\nSLUG: The slug of the resource you want to output.\n\nFor more information about the subcommand, including its usage and accepted flags, see the Chronoctl command line help.\n\nReplace RESOURCE with the resource you want to take action on.\n\nscaffold\n\nOutputs an example resource definition of the given type, including inline comments documenting its properties. For example:\n\nReplace RESOURCE with the resource you want to take action on.\n\nupdate\n\nUpdates a resource of the given type. For example:\n\nReplace the following:\n\nRESOURCE: The resource you want to take action on.\n\nFILE_NAME: The name of the definition file you want to use.\n\nFor more information about the subcommand, including its usage and accepted flags, see the Chronoctl command line help.\n\nReplace RESOURCE with the resource you want to take action on.\n\nCore commands\n\nChronoctl core commands are independent of any resource type.\n\napply\n\nApplies a configuration change to resources from a YAML or JSON file, or from standard input. When you apply resources with Chronoctl, Observability Platform creates them if they don't already exist.\n\nThe apply command accepts input from a file by providing the path as the value of the -f (--filename) flag.\n\nFor example, to apply a file containing a resource's YAML manifest:\n\nTo apply a resource passed from standard input, use the - value of the -f flag:\n\nUpon success, the command returns the list of changes applied.\n\nThe apply command accepts the dry run (-d, --dry-run) flag, which displays the changes without applying them.\n\nauth\n\nRequires Chronoctl version 1.8.0 or later (or Chronoctl 0.65.0 or later if you're using a version earlier than 1.0.0).\n\nHandles secure programmatic access to Observability Platform. This command lets users access their organizations' applications after authentication with Chronoctl.\n\nlogin: Authenticate the Chronoctl session as your Observability Platform user.\n\nlist: List all authenticated Observability Platform organizations the current user can access. Users might have access to multiple organizations such as a production and a test organization.\n\nprint-session-id: Print the stored session id for an Observability Platform organization.\n\nset-default-org: Sets the default Observability Platform organization for future commands.\n\nTo sign in, use this command:\n\nReplace YOUR-ORG-NAME with the organization you want to sign in to. For example, if your Observability Platform tenant is https://acme.chronosphere.io, replace YOUR-ORG-NAME with acme, and then follow the prompts.\n\nThis process generates a session_ID, which is cached on your machine and valid for 24 hours. If a personal access token or service account token isn't passed to Chronoctl using an environment variable or command line flag, Chronoctl uses the cached session_ID to authenticate your command.\n\nState commands\n\nThese commands evaluate the current state of Observability Platform.\n\nrule-evaluations list\n\nThe list subcommand is the only subcommand for rule-evaluations.\n\nReturns a list of rule evaluation failures, including the rule's type, slug, failure count, message, and detection timestamp.\n\nSync commands\n\nThe sync command accepts the prometheus subcommand only. Use the sync prometheus command to sync a Prometheus rules YAML file and a Prometheus Alertmanager YAML configuration file into Chronosphere format.\n\nYou include a chronoconfig.yaml file to assign the rules to a team, and to specify a team to own the related notification policy. This command converts and applies the assets and resources to your tenant.\n\nTo sync Prometheus rules into Chronosphere format:\n\nDefine a chronoconfig.yaml file to assign the converted rules to a team, and specify a team to own the related notification policy:\n\nuse_collections:\"TRUE\" group_teams: - group_regex:\".*\" team_slug:\"OWNER_TEAM\" notification_policy_team_slug:\"POLICY_TEAM\"\n\nReplace the following:\n\nOWNER_TEAM: The slug of the Observability Platform team to own the converted rules.\n\nPOLICY_TEAM: The slug of the Observability Platform team to own the notification policy.\n\nRun the sync prometheus command and pass in your Prometheus rules file, Prometheus Alertmanager configuration file, and chronoconfig.yaml file:\n\nchronoctlsyncprometheus-a [ALERTMANAGER_CONFIG] -p [PROM_RULES] -c chronoconfig.yaml [FLAGS]\n\nReplace the following:\n\nALERTMANAGER_CONFIG: The file containing your Prometheus Alertmanager configuration.\n\nPROM_RULES: The file containing your Prometheus rules.\n\nFLAGS: Any flags to include with the command. Run chronoctl sync prometheus --help to display supported flags.\n\nAdditional commands\n\nThese commands provide additional information as you use Chronoctl.\n\nhelp\n\nDisplays help text for the tool and any specified subcommand.\n\nversion\n\nDisplays the version, revision, build date, and Go version for Chronoctl. Provide this information when reporting an issue with Chronoctl to Chronosphere Support.\n\nCommand autocompletion\n\nYou can add support for shell command autocompletion with Chronoctl for the Bash, Zsh, Fish, and PowerShell by using the chronoctl completion command.\n\nThis section provides detailed steps for Bash and Zsh on macOS. For Linux-specific details and instructions for Fish and PowerShell, see the output of chronoctl help completion.",
      "# [Fleets](https://docs.chronosphere.io/fleets)\nFleets\n\nFleets in Chronosphere Telemetry Pipeline let you manage all of your Core Agent and Fluent Bit (opens in a new tab) deployments from a single, centralized location. By grouping multiple deployments under the banner of a unified fleet, you can perform batch operations across an entire fleet, instead of individually configuring dozens or hundreds of telemetry agents.\n\nSome of the benefits of using fleets in Telemetry Pipeline are:\n\nFleets streamline the process of managing telemetry agents deployed in different locations, machines, or environments.\n\nBecause all agents within a fleet share the same configuration settings, you can maintain consistent behavior between a large number of agents and roll out changes accordingly.\n\nUpdates are pulled from an HTTP endpoint rather than pushed directly to each agent, which gives you more control over your fleet's network settings and eliminates the need to open a hole in your firewall.\n\nView your fleets\n\nSelect from the following methods to view your available fleets.\n\nTo view all of your available fleets using the Telemetry Pipeline web interface (opens in a new tab), in the navigation menu select Fleets.\n\nCreate a fleet\n\nSelect from the following methods to create a fleet.\n\nTo create a new fleet using the Telemetry Pipeline user interface:\n\nSign in to the Telemetry Pipeline web interface (opens in a new tab).\n\nIn the navigation menu select Fleets, then click Create new fleet.\n\nIn Set the name of the Fleet, enter a name for your new fleet. The fleet name must be between eight and 15 characters in length.\n\nClick Next.\n\nIn the Agent Type menu, select either Fluent Bit or Core Agent.\n\nUse the corresponding instructions to update your Core Agent or Fluent Bit configuration.\n\nClick Save and deploy.\n\nUpdate a fleet\n\nSelect from the following methods to update a fleet.\n\nDelete a fleet\n\nSelect from the following methods to delete a fleet.\n\nTo delete a fleet:\n\nIn the navigation menu select Fleets.\n\nFind the fleet you want to delete in the list of fleets, and click its Delete icon.\n\nTo permanently delete the fleet, click Delete."

From my unsophisticated perspective, it appears that Grafana is the first mover in the space (meaning they were the first to raise VC funding and the are now valued the most (recently valued at $6 BN) vs Chronosphere which is now valued at $1 BN; however with the rapid growth of the market—is the market big enough for multiple players. And can companies like Grafana grow beyond the niche confines of the observability market? Can larger companies like Elastic displace smaller companies or are they complementary?\n\nBeyond these high level questions—how are these companies to work with? Are they easy to work with and put the customer first? How aggressive are they in moving customers to paying for premium services?\n\nAny thoughts and feedback are welcome and appreciated!!\n\n## Comment ID i3zp80t with +3 score by [(raptorjesus69, Reddit, 2022-04-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/grafana/comments/tzdvak/grafana_vs_chronosphere_vs_cribl/i3zp80t/) (in reply to ID tzdvak):\nThe other thing that sets grafana apart from the other two is grafana contributes much more to open source then the other companies. Grafana open sources there whole frontend along with all their databases. The only closed source parts of Grafanas observability tools are done plugins.

Cribl specializes in getting data into the platform of your choice while chronosphere and Grafana are data analytics engines with a lot of focus on metrics. Cribl and Grafana are all very easy to work with large free tiers. I don’t have a ton of experience working with Chronosphere. The demo looks good, but their focus is too narrow for me. I don’t know if it has free tier. I want metrics and traces not just metrics. Grafana has some nice features but needs more analytics options and I would prefer options for security to use it as well. Cribl is a great option to scale your staff and gather pretty much any data for your analytics backends you can route your data anywhere and are not limited by your vendors at all. If you want to use one agent and route the same event to Grafana/ELK and Splunk for different use cases not a problem. Makes it all very easy and you can shape your data anyway you want. From an architecture POV I like decoupling data collection/management from your analytics platforms. Makes it easy to use whatever data platform you want and not feel stuck.  Cribl supports any data use case so operations/o11y/security use cases are no problem.",

We found that datadog is still actually fairly affordable all things considered. When you factor the amount of time we would spend maintaining the stack internally, or compare to the costs of other fully supported third party services with similar feature sets, it ended up being a sort of wash.\n\nIn the end we still use datadog because it doesn't cost disproportionately higher than the other options and because it provides a single pane of glass for all kinds of engineers across all parts of the BU (network folks, security folks, kubernetes folks, vcenter folks, DBAs, data analysts)\n\n### Comment ID jtqnxfy with +3 score by [(cryonine, Reddit, 2023-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/15b1057/datadog_costs_that_high/jtqnxfy/) (in reply to ID jtnqoys):\nAgree with this take. The biggest thing with Datadog is having a good framework around what metrics you bring in and training engineers on how to properly leverage metrics. In our old self-hosted system we brought in tons and tons of metrics that literally no one used and had questionable value. When we brought those apps into Datadog we figured out what we did and didn’t need based on what engineers looked at, figured out if they actually make sense, and helped people implement them.\n\nEventually we had a squad that was tasked to build a custom module that wrapped the DD logger. This had various safeguards and best practices we developed internally to act as guardrails. At the end of the day the cost was more than manageable and the data was meaningful.\n\nSimilar things with logging and tracing. We took in all traces, but we rarely retained any because it wasn’t necessary. Logs were indexed only if they were security-related and the rest were dumped to S3. We had ways for engineers to watch real-time logs elsewhere.\n\nDD costs are often times only astronomical if your organization doesn’t take the time to create meaningful metrics. You rarely need *all* the data, haha.\n\n#### Comment ID jtuhpgn with +2 score by [(salynch, Reddit, 2023-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/15b1057/datadog_costs_that_high/jtuhpgn/) (in reply to ID jtqnxfy):\nYou might find this Twitter thread resonates, as well: https://twitter.com/roskilli/status/1684351974559596544\n\n## Comment ID jtuhii4 with +4 score by [(salynch, Reddit, 2023-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/15b1057/datadog_costs_that_high/jtuhii4/) (in reply to ID 15b1057):\nThis has been covered a lot, and continues to come up:\n\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/sre/comments/rhko5f/what\\_you\\_use\\_for\\_observability/](https://www.reddit.com/r/sre/comments/rhko5f/what_you_use_for_observability/) \n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/wytllq/what\\_your\\_observability\\_stack\\_in\\_2022\\_looks\\_like/](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/wytllq/what_your_observability_stack_in_2022_looks_like/)\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/sre/comments/10wcomt/where\\_to\\_store\\_highcardinality\\_metrics/](https://www.reddit.com/r/sre/comments/10wcomt/where_to_store_highcardinality_metrics/)   \n\n...and Matt Duggan's recent blog post [Monitoring is a Pain](https://matduggan.com/were-all-doing-metrics-wrong/) discusses some interesting thoughts on this, as well.\n\nu/paigerduty at Chronosphere has [written about](https://thenewstack.io/conversations-im-sick-of-having-about-observability/) the brokenness of some observability cost models, when you hit a certain scale.\n\n## Comment ID jtteuxs with +3 score by [(GilderoyLockhartt, Reddit, 2023-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/15b1057/datadog_costs_that_high/jtteuxs/) (in reply to ID 15b1057):\nits not always about datadog.. all saas gets expensive when the org scale..

Companies like Chronosphere ([https://chronosphere.io/](https://chronosphere.io/)) allow for granular controls on what is getting ingressed, what is getting stored as well looking at overall usage to understand patterns to optimize.

One the really big problems with telemetry is as your org gets larger its starts to become extremely difficult manage over usage. Teams will not prioritize metrics/log clean up or worse they will assign it to the junior/bottom engineer. I spent months fighting with teams at a large retail company to get metrics and logs under control. This only really got fixed when we had to eat a 6 figure overage charge, though in that case a lot of teams just gutted there logs/metrics as they would rather fly blind than actually manage their integrations.   \n\n\nI led 2 massive telemetry migrations at that same company and what I learned is most engineers have not idea how logs/metrics/traces work at even a basic level. Teams will again try and assign the junior or bottom engineer to this work causing more problems. I had to explain the concept of cardinality in metrics at least once a week for over a year at one point.\n\n### Comment ID jtof908 with +6 score by [(thecurlyburl, Reddit, 2023-07-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/15b1057/datadog_costs_that_high/jtof908/) (in reply to ID jtoaecp):\nHaha oh man. Cardinality is definitely one of those things where the person either gets it or they nod and will never get it. There’s no in between.\n\nI agree in general too, o11y is a foreign concept to a lot of engineers especially younger/newer ones. At face value they’re easy to grasp but difficult to leverage in a non-wasteful way.

Also they have an option to create a cluster near the data center where you are hosting your infrastructure so you will have low latency + they are managing all the headache with minor upgrades and incident management (happened once during my usage). Somehow they are managing to do more with less resources and smaller clusters. So really worth it, especially if you are using their APM.\nAnother alternative is the AWS OpenSearch service. Have a  similar experience except the APM.\n\n## Comment ID jtphwaw with +2 score by [(mvxlr, Reddit, 2023-07-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/15b1057/datadog_costs_that_high/jtphwaw/) (in reply to ID 15b1057):\nReading all the comments with tears.

I want to emphasize the fundamental difference with using an open telemetry approach. When you're using a real OTel approach, you're not locked into a single option. The work you do migrating to SigNoz or any other OTel observability tool, the process of migrating away just means changing your endpoint.   \n\n\nDatadog works \\*hard\\* to lock you in, it's the explanation for these prices getting out of control.

[gatling](https://gatling.io/) if you have (a monolith with) workflows and need more formalized code to *prove/audit* your testing.\n\nIn all cases, learn what you are really testing. In case of cloud we first test the ability to auto spin up more pods *before* the app goes into high load.  The second test is to turn this off and see what happens to the app instead when load surpasses 100%, which you end up testing the whole stack and its load/error handling capabilities. Its a must in the cloud, there are so many hidden performance settings you only know when you raise the load 10fold and wonder why their *internal routing* falls apart.

I would expect Telekinesis, snowball and Lasso to work.  \nTelekinesis is an odd one. THey way it behaves when combined with other stuns and disables is just unpredictable, other than it's going to be broken.  \nI think Snowball used to work on chrono (I remember Tusk being picked during TI to counter Void), but I believe it was changed so that the target ally has to \"make an action\" and \"accept\" the snowball invitation.

On the first glance, data dog may seems to be cheaper but if you add up all modules, it isn't. The last time I worked with new relic is 2 years ago, so my experience is lacking here.\nIt all comes down to how much money you want/can invest. Most enterprise companies will go for a paid solution.\nWhat are your requirements? What tool landscape are you running on?

Been using datadog for the past year and hate it. The engineering resources needed to support DD have been pretty crazy just to get parity with new relic. The pricing is sneaky, you’ll think DD is cheaper but when you start adding on integrations and custom metrics and tags it becomes a nightmare. Also dd is severely lacking in its ability to write ad hoc queries for data. To be quite honest i think if i switch jobs again in the future i will avoid companies that rely on DD, thats how strongly i feel after using it for a year. I think if you can go the open source route with prometheus, open telemetry, and some other apm solution i would highly recommend that route\n\n### Comment ID hotsdmi with +3 score by [(Rimbosity, Reddit, 2021-12-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sre/comments/rhko5f/what_you_use_for_observability/hotsdmi/) (in reply to ID hormrp2):\nThis was my experience with Datadog.

We use Sysdig right now and I'm rearchitecting Prometheus in December because the last deployment of that was done wrong by someone no longer with the company, and broke in spectacular fashion. The company wants to save money on Sysdig, which is literally the only monitoring and observability we have right now.\n\nI suggested Dynatrace which I have a little bit of experience with, but was shot down.\n\nWe have not started the rollout of Datadog yet but my boss is 100% sold on it, so there's zero chance of me talking him out of it. I'm not experienced enough with metrics in general just yet, so I've been okay so far with Sysdig.\n\nSysdig is easy, they've got a library, so we just pick what we want and turn it on and customize the values.\n\nHowever, I'm literally the only person capable of getting the deployment of Datadog rolled out in the cluster, so I already know I'm going to have a bad time with configuring it once it's deployed if you're saying the engineering resources are crazy to get Datadog on parity with New Relic, because nobody else knows *anything* about metrics.\n\nWe have a talented, yet small, team of 8 developers plus myself as DevOps so I'd really appreciate any learning materials we can get our hands on so that Datadog can be given enough of a chance for me to show my boss that there are better alternatives without getting anyone fired.\n\nCan you recommend any books I could start reading now try to prepare myself for Datadog?

I haven't really got a chance to use it but I don't really hear bad things about it ever. My company is starting with Datadog very soon but has good feedback for our environment in comparison to New Relic during the POCs. The environment for us falls nicely in with DD's pricing and features (not very much dev work going on and many OOB solutions) so Dyna was significantly more expensive in our specific case. Like others have mentioned though, it can quickly catch up with Dynatrace which I would recommend really looking into in that case. NR's pricing change to charge partially on users really hurts larger companies but was probably a strategic move to not be directly competitive entirely against DD.\n\n### Comment ID hosutz3 with +1 score by [(DoNnMyTh1, Reddit, 2021-12-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sre/comments/rhko5f/what_you_use_for_observability/hosutz3/) (in reply to ID hosqi87):\nThe change is user access and the surrounding pricing will create a mess for us also.\n\n#### Comment ID hotfz3p with +1 score by [(synkr0nus, Reddit, 2021-12-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sre/comments/rhko5f/what_you_use_for_observability/hotfz3p/) (in reply to ID hosutz3):\nDebugging deep new issues with New Relic often requires a Full user, however it's remarkable that Basic (free) users have access to all data.

Specifically, the new alerting system in Grafana 8.3+ does not yet support provisioning, so you have to set that up manually and that is saved in the database.

Nothing comes close for H/A prom and the architecture between tempo, loki, and cortex are almost the same, which means you get a bit of efficiency gain when you are doing config across the stack. Cortex usage on grafana is effortless since they build for that stack, and you can have zero vendor lock-in going between self hosted and grafana cloud or amazon managed prom. \n\nThat sounded like an advertisement so here’s the bad parts:\n- the cortex memory footprint is much heavier than straight Prometheus since metrics are buffered in memory for 3h (default). It’s still cheaper for me due to s3 savings for infrequently accessed metrics. \n-  the cortex documentation borders on non existent except as a reference. It’s more like an api reference than an operations guide. \n- some bits of the stack like tempo are really early in their development, if you stack them against established apm products it’s far behind. It’s very promising though. They will outpace jaeger pretty quickly at least. \n\nA footnote that Prometheus is heavily dependent on a service discovery mechanism so if you have no service catalog or you aren’t using kubernetes then you will have to BYO catalog of things to monitor, versus the agent based approach of other systems where installing an agent just adds the host.\n\n### Comment ID hus17vl with +1 score by [(SuperQue, Reddit, 2022-01-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/sevtqs/whats_your_monitoring_stack/hus17vl/) (in reply to ID huonojq):\nYea, we had a Cortex cluster for doing some centralized data.

I built out a very basic Prometheus and Grafana setup at my last company in a few days (plus a longer tail to get node_exporter rolled out everywhere, and replace the old metrics, but most of that was a matter of waiting on other teams, etc. None of it was much work). Handled metrics for 100+ VMs, some GKE clusters, and a bunch of apps running on them, plus some serverless stuff. The whole setup was about $50/month. Always had it on the todo list to scale that up, put better backups on the metrics data, do failover, etc. But it was rock solid and didn't really have any issues so that never became a priority. Nowadays, the built-in stuff in GCP and AWS are \"good enough\" for most purposes as the other comment points out and I'd start there, but going the Prometheus+Grafana route is still fine though I'd probably at least use Grafana Cloud to host the Grafana part (I'd rather let someone else worry about those upgrades).

It is basically what you are on the lookout for: per service sampling and such.  \nThe same can be done with logs by the way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf your startup qualifies, Datadog offers a [startup program](https://www.datadoghq.com/partner/datadog-for-startups/) which would probably help your organization to use their services more effectively by giving you access to a Program Manager and a range of services (formations, meetings with their engineers and others).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo give context, I have worked with them for around four years now, within orgs spending circa $300k annually.

If you want to narrow down the cost further, instead of buying several individual users, go for something like two users one for read-only purposes for viewing and all and one for configuring and managing (we did it like [sre-viewonly-user@your-company.com](mailto:sre-viewonly-user@your-company.com) and [sre-managing-user@your-company.com](mailto:sre-managing-user@your-company.com) )\n\n### Comment ID kc23hh0 with +1 score by [(SoundsGayIAmIn, Reddit, 2023-12-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sre/comments/186nnh6/benchmarks_for_observability_spend/kc23hh0/) (in reply to ID kb9btd6):\nNote that these shared accounts are technically against New Relic's policy, but they have at least so far done nothing to crack down on it.  I work at a competitor - there's plenty to praise about New Relic and it's certainly a lot easier to understand your bill than Datadog. However, I think their per-seat pricing is a mistake because it doesn't align with the natural way to increase a customer's data ingest - create features that encourage more users within the company to send more to you, so that any new team onboarding gets value right away with even a little test.\n\n## Comment ID kba8jeh with +1 score by [(eightnoteight, Reddit, 2023-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sre/comments/186nnh6/benchmarks_for_observability_spend/kba8jeh/) (in reply to ID 186nnh6):\n> Side point, but if anyone has any opinions of stacks that have worked/not worked too I'd appreciate any input!\n\ndon't use elk stack for logs. you can use clickhouse or setup a glue pipeline to send logs to s3 in columnar format and use athena query. the queries might take a bit of time but it would be similar behaviour with elk as well\n\n## Comment ID l2y4djl with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-05-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sre/comments/186nnh6/benchmarks_for_observability_spend/l2y4djl/) (in reply to ID 186nnh6):\n10 - 15% is what I've heard most companies do.\n\nOne of our customers used to spend as much as 30% on observability which is obviously a lot, so we helped them there.

They'll aim to align the value of the tool much closer to the number of engineers (assuming salaries are equivalent) that will use it rather than the amount of data you store, especially when you consider that B2B companies might have 1/10th the amount of data but have similar numbers of engineers as a similarly valued B2C.\n\nBenchmark figures for a 150 person engineering team at a B2B unicorn was (back in 2020):\n\n- Infra the powers production services was £35k/month\n\n- Logging infrastructure (self-hosted) was £10k/month\n\n- Time series data in Prometheus was £5k/month\n\n- SaaS subscriptions like Grafana etc <£10k/month\n\nObviously if we'd used the 10% rule we'd only have a £3.5k/month budget for o11y tools which would've led to weird decisions (we're paying £1.25M/month in salaries, so we expect productivity improvements to be <0.24% from o11y tools? I'd hope not!) that weren't aligned with the value we'd get from good tooling.\n\nI'd probably say budgeting against your people cost will help make better decisions and allow companies like B2B with lower data size buy better observability tools, which seems appropriate when you likely have a much higher value associated with each GB of o11y data processed than a B2C equivalent.\n\n### Comment ID kbbiyjo with +1 score by [(SuperQue, Reddit, 2023-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sre/comments/186nnh6/benchmarks_for_observability_spend/kbbiyjo/) (in reply to ID kba2ldw):\n> * Infra the powers production services was £35k/month\n> * Time series data in Prometheus was £5k/month\n\nWowza, that's a high ratio. How many series did you have with that? You're saying that ~12% of your compute spend was just Prometheus? I typically see 1%.\n\n£5k gives you about 1T of ram and 250 vCPUs in AWS with basic reserved instance pricing.

Not that hard to take advantage of it and cast it on random creep just to hit towers.\n\n#### Comment ID l5aq8b8 with +9 score by [(ematics, Reddit, 2024-05-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueDoTA2/comments/1cyfwro/patch_736_discussion/l5aq8b8/) (in reply to ID l5a5sob):\nIf anyone played HoN they basically making Lion Myrmadon lmao\n\n#### Comment ID l5bkeos with +7 score by [(GoatWife4Life, Reddit, 2024-05-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueDoTA2/comments/1cyfwro/patch_736_discussion/l5bkeos/) (in reply to ID l5a5sob):\n>run into melee as Lion\n\n>die instantly\n\n>feel the rage of a mage\n\n#### Comment ID l5ao6l1 with +8 score by [(This_is_Pat_, Reddit, 2024-05-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueDoTA2/comments/1cyfwro/patch_736_discussion/l5ao6l1/) (in reply to ID l5a5sob):\nYou're insane if you wanna go right clicking in melee range on a **lion**, a squishy hero that high level players prioritise bursting. \n\nRemember, mana drain damage had made lion a top tier pick before he took on a few waves of nerfs. \n\nIt's not nearly as straightforward as you think.\n\n#### Comment ID l5aneok with +7 score by [(HaeL756, Reddit, 2024-05-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueDoTA2/comments/1cyfwro/patch_736_discussion/l5aneok/) (in reply to ID l5a5sob):\nYea but lion is still a slow and squishy piece of shit.

And its getting closer (at the cost of primal brew).\n\nFirst of all, the facets. They're nice but not crazy when you compare it to what the other heroes get. The barrel is funny but the damage is pretty low for the stages of the game you would get it. (50 at start, 125 at max). Drunken brawler -20/+50 is generally nicer and the net positive ms means you can chase relatively well without needing to keep yourself on wind stance (so now you can be fire).\n\nSpeaking of stances...his innate is awesome. Stance was such a powerful value point early. Getting it as an innate means you can quickly get Q and W and level them up whilst keeping the advantage of being brewed up.\n\nBrewed up did get a slight nerf at level 1 but its not too terrible. Armor is the same. MS goes from 5% to 4% (practically nothing when brewed up). The actual issue is leveling up drunken brawler early feels bad now since the gains aren't as big as leveling thunderclap or cinder. Especially when thunder clap which is rescaled so its -15 damage at level 1 but then -10 and -5 as you level it. \n\nPrimal nerf. Demolish nerf again but its nothing. If pandas are hitting buildings, you're already in a nice position anyways. Actual big nerf is windwalk. 5s to 20s means you cannot combo the windwalk>nuke twice on your first split and thats damage loss.\n\nPrimal companion not having restrictions is the big one. No penalties means you can have a free panda running around without restraint. This could open up alot of playstyles. Needs more testing but I think this is the big plus.\n\n### Comment ID l5asgt2 with +10 score by [(phancerlantom, Reddit, 2024-05-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueDoTA2/comments/1cyfwro/patch_736_discussion/l5asgt2/) (in reply to ID l5aa0qc):\nBrew is always a wall of text man, we have more heroes to go so maybe later.\n\n#### Comment ID l5ass0k with +5 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-05-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueDoTA2/comments/1cyfwro/patch_736_discussion/l5ass0k/) (in reply to ID l5asgt2):\nto be real, not many people play him so its expected.\n\nfunnily enough, the changes are actually not as radical as a lot of other heroes.\n\n### Comment ID l5byzxh with +2 score by [(PacManRandySavage, Reddit, 2024-05-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueDoTA2/comments/1cyfwro/patch_736_discussion/l5byzxh/) (in reply to ID l5aa0qc):\nThe nerf to primal split is a direct reaction to buffing primal companion which feels like they’re pushing aghs as the build.

Such a huge advantage. \n\nAlch- getting seed money… lol. We should be seeing this hero mid every game. That’s a free soul ring, means spamming acid from level 1.\n\nPuck- Puck got a HUGE freaking boost on skill shots. Good lord. And huge healing potentials. \n\nLeshrac- with the new facet ability, I think we will see shrac player as a real, non pos 1 core. Should go for real raw damage, with less mana needs late game. I can’t imagine what that looks like with .5 area of effect plus blood stone at level 25. Probably fucking OP.\n\nLifestealer- 2 HP per unit killed….

Avenging missile for VS seems like its gonna smash hard. The spread damage windrunner one looks interesting, looks like you trade massive single target for beyblading arrows in a team fight. Beastmaster has beast mode which could be nuts, since it applies wild axes debuff...\n\nLots of stuff that looks very fun to play with. Bit disappointed with Visage, need to play a game with it to see if the grave chill one is any good since not microing takes some of the fun out of the character. QOL for upgrading without resummoning is nice, sometimes you would have to hold off resummoning because you were close to 12. \n\nYasha and Kaya will be nice on a few characters now, cast speed is a very good stat if old arcane blink taught us anything.

They just need to balance certain heroes with more options, since a lot of them feel like talents you just take at the start of the game rather than these heroe changing choice.\n\nInnates currently feel like they were more rushed as they wanted to have all heroes to have Innates instead of those that either need it for balance reasons. Like Centaur just giving you free extra HP, the respawn altering effects of Abbadon and Undying that lets you reduce the death timer, or Dawnbreaker just giving you full map vision if the sun comes up (which can be forced with certain abilties), Oracle breaking the power rune gameplay by just existing in order to know the location of a power rune spawm, and Gyrocopter breaking the item economy by being to disassemble items that are not dissasemble-able.\n\n### Comment ID l5a16m7 with +12 score by [(Mothanul, Reddit, 2024-05-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueDoTA2/comments/1cyfwro/patch_736_discussion/l5a16m7/) (in reply to ID l59ukni):\nThat's what's been going on for a while.

The shittiness scales as she goes, where normally you'd have +50% agi at level 18, now you get to have +36%. Which is 6% more than she used to have at level 6. How cool!\n\n**Huskar** - Always a squishy boi with low armour, now he gets to take even MORE damage from his own abilities, taking 150 dmg from inner fire (at level 4) and 4% (instead of 3%) HP damage from spears. AND he no longer disarms with inner fire! Neat! Now he has 0 counter to physical damage and punches himself in the dick every time he casts a spell, but I'm sure the extra 5% magic resist (more like 4% when you factor the multiplicative stacking) when he's at 10% health will make all the difference lol.

Invoker: no more spell amp on sunstrike. But getting lifesteal makes up for this nerf. Also, agnostic facet is like an easier invoker for beginners. Deny exp is back baby. (should help with support invoker level balance as well). All spell CDs have been reduced, this is actually such a great buff, along with OC you are going to be an actual arsenal magus. \n\n2. Magnus: Skewer distance damage was really good, but this patch makes it more interesting to understand terrain and skewer them. Second facet is shit IMO. Very hard to use it correctly. \n\n3. Morphing: Nerfed again, first shotgun, then aghs nerf and now this. Kinda bad, support morphling is viable now? but the kit is not good for support at all. I was expecting them to bring back shotgun morph. \n\n4. Earth Spirit: One facet is kinda good, the other kills the hero. I think atk dmg helps mid ES a lot to destroy sidelanes. \n\n5. Ember: Farming and laning against other melee mid heroes has become better I suppose. I think clearing camps shud be way easier. \n\n6. Antimage: Mana thirst sounds really OP, he is probably gonna crush laning so much harder than before. Diffusal first item is now even better. \n\n7. Phantom Assassin: Looks like a big nerf to blur, cannot sneaky farm anymore, and if you take the second facet, you are shooting yourself in the foot. Stifling focus chance is actually amazing, and lucky double crits can change the fight instantly. I really don't want to see double moon shard PA, Slardar atk speed rush is enough for the game. \n\n8. Pudge: Roaming pudge looks stronger now, esp while ulting. I personally like the second facet too, ranged hooks are my specialty, so Imma try calculating the damage and checking which is better. \n\n9. Riki: Huge buffs IMO, support riki with facet 1 = faster levels. also riki can get more dmg with backstab from level 1, thats great. Riki facet two is an incredible farmer, esp with aghs. Smoke screen ally buff is amazing, and ToT agility buff is great, no one makes high agi items on riki usually to benefit from % increase buff. flat buff is quite good, as I can go for items like nullifier or daedalus more confidently, instead of thinking about butterfly or disperser, just for the agi.\n\n### Comment ID l5a8vxb with +17 score by [(Gillfreex, Reddit, 2024-05-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueDoTA2/comments/1cyfwro/patch_736_discussion/l5a8vxb/) (in reply to ID l5a4oln):\nI don't like your hero pool\n\n#### Comment ID l5acxr9 with +2 score by [(EternalYouth98, Reddit, 2024-05-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueDoTA2/comments/1cyfwro/patch_736_discussion/l5acxr9/) (in reply to ID l5a8vxb):\nEvolved from mid to pos4 to safe now.\n\n### Comment ID l5alt0g with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-05-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueDoTA2/comments/1cyfwro/patch_736_discussion/l5alt0g/) (in reply to ID l5a4oln):\nDid you test pudge?

This is a really bad patch for several reasons. I can go on about how imba some of these changes are but what I have the biggest problem with is adding yet another complex mechanic to the game that makes it even harder for newer players to come on board. I think I may be alone in thinking this, but I genuinely feel like Valve may have taken a step in the direction of killing this game. With harder mechanics to grasp, this game is yet another step away from becoming a noob friendly game. I’m sure we’ll see some great pro gameplay out of this, but I don’t see this as a beneficial update to the DOTA community at large.\n\n### Comment ID l5aw44p with +9 score by [(Bitsand, Reddit, 2024-05-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueDoTA2/comments/1cyfwro/patch_736_discussion/l5aw44p/) (in reply to ID l5aq912):\nngl I see this similar comment when talent tree was introduced.\n\n### Comment ID l5etfef with +3 score by [(Thin-Guard6713, Reddit, 2024-05-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueDoTA2/comments/1cyfwro/patch_736_discussion/l5etfef/) (in reply to ID l5aq912):\nAgree and disagree at the same time.

OVERcomplication isn't a good thing by itself. With such complexity present, brain can comprehend less and less, the game becomes less of a strategy and more of reacting to random chaos player sees on the screen at a particular moment.\n\nAnd there's like no opposite side of the coin? They introduced more complexity for the sake of complexity, most of the stuff isn't even interesting really.\n\nI'd rather welcome removal of mechanics: deleting talents, deleting neutral items, deleting shards etc; even if you find anything of those interesting, it very well may be that complexity decrease will make game better overall. More mechanics doesn't equal better.\n\n### Comment ID l5awaqh with +1 score by [(Murakkin, Reddit, 2024-05-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueDoTA2/comments/1cyfwro/patch_736_discussion/l5awaqh/) (in reply to ID l5aq912):\nI agree, game is getting increasingly hard to pick up and it was one of the hardest one already.\n\n## Comment ID l5aivfv with +4 score by [(CloudCuddler, Reddit, 2024-05-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueDoTA2/comments/1cyfwro/patch_736_discussion/l5aivfv/) (in reply to ID 1cyfwro):\nDoes Dota really need more info and abilities that people will never read or understand?\n\n### Comment ID l5aps62 with +11 score by [(Ok_Instruction6924, Reddit, 2024-05-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueDoTA2/comments/1cyfwro/patch_736_discussion/l5aps62/) (in reply to ID l5aivfv):\nYes\n\n## Comment ID l59o0ae with +2 score by [(Onetwenty7, Reddit, 2024-05-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueDoTA2/comments/1cyfwro/patch_736_discussion/l59o0ae/) (in reply to ID 1cyfwro):\nThe facets on earth spirit seem absolutely random for his gameplay.

Stuff like Bloodseeker's lifesteal just being permanently innate and giving extra levers to truly buff Jugg to modern carry status are really smart. So many extra ways for them to balance and buff SK as well for example. And in terms of items, where one hero has forced devs to over nerf an item because it's so singularly good, like bloodstone storm, they can now just give them an innate or facet that mimics it, let the hero buy other items instead, and let the problem item continue to be fine for everyone else. It's clever for these reasons.\n\n## Comment ID l5aa5ik with +1 score by [(nahidfuck, Reddit, 2024-05-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueDoTA2/comments/1cyfwro/patch_736_discussion/l5aa5ik/) (in reply to ID 1cyfwro):\nabaddon is killed as carry now, but he is nice support now\n\n## Comment ID l5acq0w with +1 score by [(Responsible_Cup2387, Reddit, 2024-05-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueDoTA2/comments/1cyfwro/patch_736_discussion/l5acq0w/) (in reply to ID 1cyfwro):\nPrimal beast is also OP now\n\n## Comment ID l5ad03t with +1 score by [(tempreffunnynumber, Reddit, 2024-05-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueDoTA2/comments/1cyfwro/patch_736_discussion/l5ad03t/) (in reply to ID 1cyfwro):\n[As per uge](https://i594.photobucket.com/albums/tt30/johannn98/rage58.gif)\n\n## Comment ID l5ahgat with +1 score by [(ProfPeanut, Reddit, 2024-05-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueDoTA2/comments/1cyfwro/patch_736_discussion/l5ahgat/) (in reply to ID 1cyfwro):\n9-slotted Techies is the new one-button rampage dream.\n\nEven if they stay in support role, having 10 usable item slots all the time feels like blatant cheating.

Everyone is willing to help each other out and while not mandatory, people at the New York office like to hang out with each other after work\n- The company actively works to improve itself. Upon hearing about burnout, the company established Chronosummers, which includes half day fridays and an entire week off in August. Personally feels unheard of at a startup\n- Fantastic work benefits; on top of the typical retirement plan, there's also a mental health program, education stipend and lunch reimbursement.\n- Lots of career growth opportunities",

Combine this with a great product and a strong customer focus and Chronosphere is a winner!\n\nIt's fast paced and high growth, but they're doing everything right. Even at this fast pace, the company really enforces work-life balance by encouraging employees to take time off, not work weekends, and half day Fridays all summer. They really care about the mental and physical health of their employees.\n\nI highly recommend Chronosphere!",

Taking time off is promoted - I don't feel bad taking PTO to rest and recharge. The benefits and perks I receive make me feel truly appreciated and help me be more effective in my role (mental health counseling, gym credits, etc). Our founders are heavily involved, approachable, and have my full faith.

      "# [Chronosphere Accelerates Revenue Growth and Global Customer Success with New Executive Leadership and Programs on 2024-05-07](https://chronosphere.io/news/chronosphere-accelerates-growth-new-executive-leadership/)\nNew York, May 7, 2024 — Observability innovator, Chronosphere, today announced strategic leadership moves to accelerate the company’s go-to-market initiatives, global scale, and customer support. Margaret Dawson joins the company as Global Head of Marketing and Bill Hineline is the new Field Chief Technology Officer. These moves come as Chronosphere continues to build out its full-stack observability platform following the acquisition of Calyptia earlier this year and increased investments in its European operations and partner alliances.\n\n“Both Margaret and Bill bring a wealth of experience helping customers increase the value and performance of critical technology platforms and innovations, and we are thrilled to have them on the team as our customers work to update their approach to observability and monitoring,” said Martin Mao, CEO of Chronosphere. “Their experience crafting customer and data-driven go-to-market strategies, as well as managing teams, will further propel our growth and adoption.\n\nA proven marketing and technology executive, Dawson brings more than 25 years of experience at early-stage startups and Fortune 500 companies. Most recently, she was Vice President of Portfolio Strategy and Chief of Staff to the CEO at Apptio, the leading technology spend and value management company, which IBM acquired in 2023. Prior to joining Apptio, she spent seven years at Red Hat, the leading provider of enterprise open source solutions. Ranked as one of the top Women in Cloud Computing, Dawson was named Business Role Model of the Year for Women in IT, and Mentor and Coach of the Year by the Stevie Business Awards.\n\nHineline joins Chronosphere after 17 years with United Airlines and brings a wealth of cross-functional expertise to his position. Over the last 24 years in the airline industry, he held a variety of leadership roles, ranging from IT operations and engineering to digital marketing. In his last role, he served as Director of Enterprise Observability for United Airlines. As Field CTO, Hineline will serve as a trusted advisor for Chronosphere customers. In his role, he will bridge the gap between business challenges and observability solutions by sharing real-world experience from a customer perspective.\n\nOther executives who will assume new and expanded roles include Ian Smith, who has been appointed Chief of Staff to the CEO and Head of Strategy, following four years as Field CTO and Solutions Engineering lead. Current head of Solution Engineering, Seong Park, will now also lead the Customer Success Engineering and Technical Advisory Management (TAM) team with a promotion to Global Head of Customer Success and Solution Engineering. Prior to Chronosphere, Park led Customer Success organizations at Lacework and ThoughtSpot. Finally, Calyptia Co-Founder Anurag Gupta will become the company’s first Field Architect to help design and implement solutions across telemetry pipeline and observability for Chronosphere’s growing global customer base.",
      "# [Chronosphere Acquires Calyptia, Creators of Leading Observability Pipeline Solutions on 2024-01-22](https://chronosphere.io/news/chronosphere-acquires-calyptia/)\nCompany to Integrate Calyptia’s Capabilities with its Observability Platform while Continuing Support of Open Source Projects\n\nNEW YORK – January 22, 2024 – Chronosphere, the leading cloud native observability platform, announced that it has acquired Calyptia, a leading provider of observability pipeline solutions. Chronosphere will integrate Calyptia’s core technology, which provides log transformation and optimization capabilities, into the company’s cloud native observability platform.\n\nCalyptia is founded by the original creators of the Fluent Ecosystem, which includes the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) graduated projects Fluent Bit and Fluentd. The vendor-agnostic Fluent projects are lightweight and highly scalable log processors. They allow organizations to collect telemetry from multiple sources and distribute them to any defined destination. With more than 12 billion downloads, Fluent Bit is the preferred logging processor for cloud native environments. As part of its ongoing commitment to open source, Chronosphere will continue to invest in the Fluent projects and community.\n\nCalyptia’s observability pipeline product is built on top of Fluent Bit. The addition of this pipeline to Chronosphere’s platform enables the routing, transformation, and optimization of log data at scale. With these new capabilities, teams have a central interface to:\n\nControl costs at the source by not having to send the data they don’t need. Intelligent built-in filters can reduce volumes by 30% or more.\n\nProvide additional context by enriching data or improve security by redacting data – all in flight, before the data is stored at its destination.\n\nAnalyze log data in realtime while it’s being collected instead of waiting for it to be stored and indexed, allowing developers to quickly debug production impacting issues.\n\nChronosphere also recently announced its new log storage and visualization functionality, Logs powered by Crowdstrike. With both announcements, Chronosphere customers now have end-to-end logging capabilities in addition to the rest of the observability platform.\n\n“With observability data growing by orders of magnitude, companies are ill-equipped to manage the costs and scale of this deluge, forcing their teams to make trade-offs. Teams are especially challenged to handle log data which is prohibitively expensive to move and store,” said Martin Mao, CEO and Co-Founder, Chronosphere. “With the addition of Calyptia’s leading observability pipeline solution, we’re taking an important step to ensure that developers have the ultimate control over all their observability data from end to end—including log files to control cost and improve developer productivity.”\n\n“We are excited to join the Chronosphere team, which shares our passion and history of innovation in helping companies transform their approach to observability,” said Eduardo Silva, Founder, Calyptia. “We look forward to combining our solutions to make observability even more effective and more cost efficient, for any type of company and every telemetry data type. We’re excited to continue building and supporting the Fluent Ecosystem as an open source and vendor neutral solution.”\n\n“Calyptia joining the Chronosphere team is excellent news for everyone who is invested in the future of open source cloud native technology,” said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). “In today’s world, anyone that doesn’t adopt open source technology risks being left behind. I’m excited to see how the Fluentd and Fluent Bit projects will continue to grow and evolve as more end users embrace the capabilities of cloud native observability.”\n\nAdditional Resources:",

By ranking and highlighting the most probable sources of issues, DDx enables developers to quickly test their hypotheses and pivot if needed. This rapid analysis leads to faster root cause identification and, ultimately, quicker problem resolution.\n\nUsing open-source standards for data collection, Chronosphere’s observability platform enables cloud-native developers to focus on the most impactful customer issues and understand the problem faster. DDx is currently available to analyze distributed trace data and will be rolled out for other telemetry data types in the future.\n\nThe company also announced additional capabilities to provide incremental benefits:\n\nFaster Time to Insight: The latest Chronosphere Lens features give customers a unified, multi-telemetry visualization of services and microservices. Developers gain a comprehensive understanding of their application’s health and performance without the need for proprietary agents or complicated workflows.\n\nProactive Issue Prevention: Advanced Service Level Objective management includes simplified SLO creation capabilities. Teams can better align development efforts with business objectives and prioritize resolving the most impactful customer-facing issues.\n\n“We are improving life for on-call incident response teams who work with microservices and Kubernetes architectures,” said Jeff Cobb, Global Head of Product and Design at Chronosphere. “With these new capabilities, engineers and developers can uncover key issues faster and use simplified workflows that allow them to diagnose issues in a repeatable, optimized way. The new functionalities are open source compatible to fully leverage existing and future software without increased cost or complexity.”",

      "# [twisting roguelike that blends action and tactics by Mike Holmes on 2024-03-19](https://rogueliker.com/enter-the-chronosphere-trailer/)\nI was trawling through the usual selection of press releases from today and I found one potential gem that I wanted to sign post for you all, and that’s Enter the Chronosphere.\n\nNot only does the game have a wicked-cool name, but it looks like an absolute trip – in a good way, of course. Nobody likes a bad trip…\n\nThe game has only recently resurfaced, now with a Steam page, and so I grabbed the trailer that developer Effort Star (and publisher Joystick Ventures) have prepared for the game’s upcoming appearance at PAX East.\n\nI’m not going to the event which makes the PAX bit rather irrelevant to me, however, its intriguing blend of mechanics does have my attention – and who doesn’t love a good trailer!\n\nWhat is Enter the Chronosphere?\n\nAccording to the devs, their game offers a mixture of turn-based tactics and real-time action. Players will be able to play at their own pace “alternating between bold action and careful planning.” It looks like you’ll be able to move around and act quickly, but then slow things down when you need to think.\n\nIt sounds like crafting “wild combinations of weapons, items, and character abilities” is going to be central to the experience, as players traverse a variety of strange, labyrinthine biomes and battle the enemies that they find within.\n\nSo what is a “chronosphere” I here you ask? Well, Dear Reader, according to Effort Star – and they should know – it’s a huge structure that consumes time and twists reality. Apparently, the “deeper you go, the weirder it gets” – which only makes me want to visit one more!\n\nInside these chronospheres we’ll meet all manner of strange enemies, however, we’ll also able to take things from one world to another. That means that we can combine the gear that we find along the way (the Steam page includes examples such as “revolvers and radguns, spears and sniper rifles, wakizashis and wasps”).\n\nWe’ll be in control of a “crew of misfits” – which sounds like they’ll be quite personable. By completing missions we’ll be able to unlock new abilities for them, as well as “game modes, threats and secrets.”\n\nWhen can one enter their own chronosphere?\n\nThere’s no release date at the time of writing, but I’ve wishlisted it and will report back as and when there are any developments.\n\nIf you can’t wait to get your hands on the game, of course you could head over to PAX East, but if you’re like me and that’s not feasible, you could always play an earlier version of the game.\n\nEnter the Chronosphere started life during 7DRL Challenge 2021, and there’s a playable version of an earlier prototype over on Itch.io.",

      "# [The Combined Power of Chronosphere and Calyptia by Torsten Volk, David Cassel, Heather Joslyn, Amanda Brock, Dawn Foster, B. Cameron Gain, Joab Jackson, Loraine Lawson, Apu Pavithran, Jack Wallen on 2024-02-06](https://thenewstack.io/the-combined-power-of-chronosphere-and-calyptia/)\nChronosphere’s acquisition of Calyptia is a shrewd strategic move that adds strong data pipeline management capabilities to Chronosphere’s cloud native observability platform. Both Chronosphere and Calyptia follow a federated management paradigm that includes a central SaaS-based control plane that remains out of stream, in combination with multiple data planes that can be located close to the customer’s application clusters.\n\nThis acquisition is impressive alone based on the fact that Chronosphere found a like-minded company focusing on the highest possible degree of scalability. Like Chronosphere, Calyptia is the result of a seasoned founder team seeking to figure out a solution to the rapid growth of cloud native infrastructure in terms of quantity, complexity, and constant change.\n\nThe Chronosphere observability platform resulted from the rich experience the founder team had made at Uber, while Calyptia launched in 2020 with the idea of providing commercial services around Fluentd and Fluent Bit, to open source data collector projects the company helped found. But not only do both companies follow very similar philosophies in their approach toward establishing cloud native observability, but Calyptia has the final puzzle piece Chronosphere needed to become a truly formidable contender in the cloud native observability space: a platform for data pipeline management.\n\nWhy Developers Should Care\n\nAfter the introduction of Lens, Chronosphere’s capability to automatically surface telemetry data relevant to any specific developer, the acquisition of Calyptia will allow Chronosphere to add more developer goodies to its platform. This radically developer-centric approach is so impressive as all of the traditional observability platforms have tried this same strategy without much success, creating space for Chronosphere in the market. The key strategic value propositions of this acquisition are:\n\nEnhancing Developer Productivity: Calyptia Core, built on the open source Fluent Bit data collection agent, is tailored to streamline developer workflows, thereby boosting productivity in observability tasks. Developers can simply connect telemetry data sources with transformation steps and export targets to optimize observability for their application via a drag-and-drop interface and without having to worry about complex agent management procedures.\n\nExamples:\n\nAutomated Log Aggregation: A developer working on a microservices architecture needs to aggregate logs from various services for debugging. Fluent Bit can be configured to automatically collect logs from all services and forward them to Calyptia Core. This eliminates the need for manual log collection, allowing the developer to focus on analyzing the aggregated logs to quickly identify and resolve issues.\n\nStreamlined Monitoring for Kubernetes: In a Kubernetes environment, a developer can use Fluent Bit as a DaemonSet to collect metrics and logs from each node. Calyptia Core can then process this data, applying filters and transformations before sending it to a monitoring solution like Prometheus or Grafana. This setup simplifies the monitoring pipeline and reduces the time spent on configuring and managing multiple monitoring agents.\n\nOptimizing Observability Costs: A key focus of Calyptia Core is to reduce the costs associated with observability. This is achieved through more efficient data management, which directly benefits Chronosphere’s clientele by simplifying telemetry data ingestion and management.\n\nExamples:\n\nReducing Data Ingestion Costs: Calyptia Core’s First Mile Observability strategy optimizes observability costs by focusing on efficient data management at the source. This approach reduces backend and egress costs, particularly beneficial for organizations dealing with IoT and edge applications spread across disparate public and private infrastructure. By filtering out noisy data before it is ingested into systems like Splunk, organizations can reduce costs and improve data quality, with some of Calyptia’s customers reporting substantial savings on their Splunk bills.\n\nAdditionally, by routing data to more cost-effective storage locations, organizations can significantly reduce the costs associated with data growth. This strategy enables organizations to gain immediate insights, improve data quality, and significantly reduce their observability costs.\n\nRouting Non-Essential Data to Cheaper Storage: Calyptia Core, powered by Fluent Bit, allows organizations to redirect non-essential data to cheaper storage. This can result in substantial savings, especially when using costly storage and analysis applications.\n\nBoosting Performance and Security: By leveraging Calyptia’s technologies, Chronosphere aims to enhance the performance of its observability platforms and fortify application security, addressing two critical concerns in modern computing environments.\n\nExamples:\n\nData Security: Calyptia Core provides features to identify sensitive data and redact, remove, or hash it midstream before it is stored. This capability can enhance the security of Chronosphere’s observability platforms by ensuring sensitive data is not unnecessarily exposed or stored.\n\nPerformance Measurement: Calyptia emphasizes the importance of effective performance measurement, which can help Chronosphere to establish performance benchmarks and goals, ensuring the quality of its application improves over time. By tracking metrics over time, teams can detect changes in behavior that may point to an underlying issue, thereby enhancing the performance of the observability platforms.\n\nAddressing Microservices Architecture Challenges: The growing trend toward microservices architecture, characterized by loosely coupled services owned by different teams and residing in varied cloud environments, poses unique challenges in observability, particularly in cost management and risk mitigation. The Chronosphere-Calyptia combination aims to offer solutions to these emerging challenges.\n\nExamples:\n\nEnhanced Observability: Microservices architecture can be complex and difficult to monitor due to the distributed nature of services. Chronosphere’s observability platform, enhanced by Calyptia’s log processing capabilities, can provide comprehensive visibility into the system. This allows for efficient troubleshooting and debugging, which are crucial in a microservices environment where services are loosely coupled and owned by different teams.\n\nCost Management: The cost of observability can be a significant challenge in a microservices environment due to the high volume of data generated. Calyptia’s platform can reduce the volume of data at the source using filters, making it more cost-effective to analyze. This can help Chronosphere manage the cost of observability in a microservices architecture.\n\nPipelines Simplified: Low Code/No-Code for Data Collection, Processing and Export\n\nCalyptia Core simplifies data pipeline construction and management in cloud native environments through a low-code/no-code approach. Its drag-and-drop interface allows developers to build data pipelines visually, reducing complexity and making it accessible to those with limited coding expertise. With over 100 integrations, Calyptia Core standardizes data collection across various applications and environments. It also offers built-in data processing transformations for data enrichment, aggregation, filtering, and reduction. Developers can test their pipelines in a sandbox environment before deployment, reducing risks.\n\nCalyptia leverages Fluent Bit’s pluggable architecture, eliminating the need for SDKs and APIs for custom integration code. Fluent Bit’s input, filter, and output plugins collect, process, and route data respectively. It also integrates well with Kubernetes and Prometheus, enriching logs with Kubernetes metadata and integrating with Prometheus Grafana dashboards.\n\nWebAssembly Integration\n\nThe Fluent Bit WebAssembly (WASM) plugin introduces a significant shift in data processing capabilities within observability frameworks, moving beyond traditional methods like Lua scripting or regular expressions. WASM allows developers to use comprehensive programming languages like C, Golang, and Rust for custom data processing tasks, compiled into a portable and efficient WASM binary for high performance and low overhead. This enables sophisticated log processing routines in complex cloud native environments, where logs can be filtered, enriched, and classified. For example, a routine could parse log entries, extract key information, and enrich the logs with additional context from an external API.\n\nThe WASM plugin can also leverage advanced technologies like large language models (LLMs) for tasks such as sentiment analysis, trend prediction, or anomaly detection. For instance, an LLM could categorize logs based on their urgency or potential impact on system performance, enabling a more focused and efficient observability strategy.\n\nAdditionally, the WASM plugin can facilitate sophisticated routing mechanisms, allowing log data to be routed to different destinations based on the analysis performed. In essence, the Fluent Bit WASM plugin enhances data observability and analysis capabilities in complex and dynamic cloud native environments by allowing the use of full-fledged programming languages and the integration of state-of-the-art AI models.\n\nSmall Footprint\n\nFluent Bit’s small footprint is a key feature for data collection efficiency in cloud native microservices architectures. Its implementation entirely in C results in a dramatically reduced memory footprint, operating with just around 1MB compared to FluentD’s 40MB and an average OpenTelemetry collector’s 50MB. This minimal resource usage is crucial in distributed environments with numerous microservices, where it leads to cost reductions and performance improvements.\n\nFluent Bit’s lean architecture allows for widespread deployment across application containers without significant resource consumption, especially important in Kubernetes environments. Additionally, the compiled C code enhances Fluent Bit’s data processing speed, essential for real-time observability and monitoring, making it a highly suitable solution for modern cloud native architectures.\n\nIn-Stream Processing\n\nFluent Bit’s in-stream processing, particularly through tail reading, enhances real-time data handling in cloud native environments by continuously monitoring and capturing changes in log files. This capability is beneficial in dynamic cloud native architectures, where the volume and velocity of data can be substantial.\n\nFluent Bit’s in-stream processing reduces latency and resource consumption, supports advanced operations such as applying new data schemata, parsing logs, and enriching data streams. For example, it can dynamically parse and structure log data, convert it from unstructured to structured formats, and enrich the data stream by applying tags or integrating additional metadata. This process is crucial for context-aware monitoring and analysis, providing deeper insight into the behavior and performance of applications and services.\n\nIn essence, Fluent Bit’s in-stream processing and tail reading capabilities enable efficient, real-time observability in cloud native environments, ensuring immediate data availability and facilitating advanced data manipulation.\n\nFluent Bit and OpenTelemetry: Better Together\n\nThe integration of Fluent Bit and OpenTelemetry offers a comprehensive data collection and analysis solution for modern observability, combining Fluent Bit’s efficiency with OpenTelemetry’s extensive instrumentation capabilities. Fluent Bit, with its lightweight footprint, can be deployed as a sidecar container in each pod of a Kubernetes cluster, using the OpenTelemetry input plugin to collect telemetry data directly from the application and infrastructure for real-time data collection and processing.\n\nFluent Bit can also collect logs and metrics from multiple microservices and send this data to observability tools like Jaeger and AWS X-Ray using the OpenTelemetry output plugin, enabling a unified view of distributed systems and aiding in tracing requests through microservices. Furthermore, Fluent Bit’s customizable nature allows for the collection of targeted telemetry data, which can be enriched, processed, and exported to OpenTelemetry-compatible backends for detailed analysis and visualization, providing bespoke insights into applications. In essence, the combination of Fluent Bit and OpenTelemetry provides a flexible, efficient, and comprehensive observability framework for diverse monitoring needs.\n\nConclusion: A New Era in Cloud Native Observability\n\nThe acquisition of Calyptia by Chronosphere marks a pivotal advancement in cloud native observability. This strategic alignment not only enhances Chronosphere’s observability platform but also signifies a commitment to scalability and developer-centric solutions. The integration of Calyptia’s efficient data management tools with Chronosphere’s existing capabilities paves the way for more intuitive, cost-effective, and performance-oriented observability in complex cloud native ecosystems.\n\nThis merger is particularly significant in its potential to streamline developer workflows and optimize data pipeline management, underpinned by the robust capabilities of Fluent Bit and OpenTelemetry. The future of observability in the cloud native domain looks promising, with this partnership poised to deliver more refined, intelligent, and adaptive solutions, addressing the intricate demands of modern application development and operations.\n\nIn short, Chronosphere’s acquisition of Calyptia is not just a merger of two companies but a fusion of shared visions and technological prowess, setting a new benchmark in the field of cloud native observability."
