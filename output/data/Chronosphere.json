      "# [Cloud Observability Solutions on 2023-08-10](https://chronosphere.io/solutions/)\nInfrastructure metrics are the backbone of your observability implementation. This is especially true in a cloud native infrastructure environment. With an efficient cloud infrastructure monitoring solution that was purpose-built to reliably handle the scale of cloud native, you will know about issues before your customers do.\n\nChronosphere ingests a variety of open source infrastructure metrics formats from Prometheus to Graphite/StatsD and ships with out of the box dashboards like cAdvisor that give you instant insight into your Kubernetes clusters making Kubernetes monitoring easy.\n\nWith Prometheus, you can export infrastructure metrics from virtually any server, database, or service mesh. Monitoring infrastructure is a foundational to your observability strategy.\n\nApplication performance monitoring (APM,) or the task of troubleshooting application errors or performance issues, is no easy feat in a distributed microservices environment. With Chronosphere, engineers of any experience level can understand the root cause of issues via the insights provided by the automated analysis of the underlying Observability data.\n\nHarnessing the power of distributed tracing via OpenTelemetry, your tangled mess of microservices goes from unintelligible to understandable. The results? Fewer incidents, faster resolution, happier customers and developers thanks to the power of cloud native application monitoring.\n\nWhen your business moves at the speed of cloud, you can’t wait hours or days to understand business impact. With Chronosphere’s millisecond ingest and one second alert intervals, you can react to business metrics like revenue flow and customer engagement in seconds.\n\nWith a single solution that can connect infrastructure errors through to application performance all the way up to business impacts, you always have a 360 degree view of your business performance.\n\nCloud native environments produce massive amounts of telemetry data. Developers need this data to effectively operate and troubleshoot systems, but it quickly leads to observability costs spiraling out of control.\n\nWith Chronosphere, you still collect all the same data, but it’s aggregated and transformed into actionable insight that is usable for developers, while also being highly cost efficient. The result is greater predictability, increased accountability, and significant cost savings.\n\nWhen customer-facing issues arise, your developers need the best tools to solve these issues, fast. Chronosphere rapidly orients developers to the problem at hand with context-rich alerts and seamless linking of data types for faster time to triage. With a solution that is accessible for all levels of developers, you will no longer have your most senior resources pulled into every incident response.\n\nThe results? When you can scale reliably and meet customer demand, you’ll see increased revenue and less customer churn.\n\nWhen your observability solution is unreliable, the entire organization suffers. Developers can’t ship code, or worse, fly blind during an outage. They spend longer on troubleshooting, which means they are slower to deliver new features, which in turn frustrates customers and puts revenue at risk.\n\nWith Chronosphere, you gain an observability platform that is reliable, scalable, and performant, so engineers spend less time in the weeds and more time innovating\n\nWhile many organizations begin their cloud native observability journey with open source tools like Prometheus or Jaeger, they quickly run into major hurdles. The two big challenges that companies face when running their own open source observability in-house is the significant management overhead and tooling that is unreliable and slow.\n\nWith Chronosphere, you get the best of both worlds: a fully open source compatible solution that relieves the management overview and delivers best in class availability and performance.

      "# [FAQs on 2023-08-10](https://chronosphere.io/faqs/)\nChronosphere’s Observability Platform\n\nThe Chronosphere platform can ingest metrics, events, logs and distributed trace data in a variety of open source formats, such as Prometheus and OpenTelemetry, and gives teams the ability to cut through the noise to rapidly detect, understand and remediate issues before they impact customers.\n\nChronosphere’s Telemetry Pipeline\n\nChronosphere Telemetry Pipeline, from the creators of Fluent Bit and Calyptia, streamlines log collection, aggregation, transformation, and routing from any source to any destination.\n\nThis allows companies who are dealing with high costs and complexity the ability to control their data and scale their growing business needs.\n\nMonitoring data is growing faster than infrastructure/apps built to monitor it, and the increase in scale has created bottlenecks for reliability, performance and cost.\n\nThe result is that you often end up flying blind because metrics are not available or are too hard to find quickly. When surges in metric cardinality or read traffic happen in solutions not built for this level of complexity, it gets very expensive, very fast, the problem gets ignored, or the dashboards take too long to load, leading to system failures.\n\nWith Chronosphere, users have tools to help them understand their metric data in real-time, and filter/group by any metric labels to understand what the biggest contributors to write traffic are.\n\nChronosphere Observability Platform has a unique pricing model that is different from others out there. Instead of pricing based on host or VM, Chronosphere only charges for the useful data that you choose to retain in the Chronosphere Observability Platform. With our Control Plane, you can analyze and shape your observability data to fulfill your existing dashboard and alerting needs without having to store all the data in the raw form. Unlike other observability solutions that require you to store, query, and pay for all data, whether or not it is useful, Chronosphere pre-computes the data to get rid of the waste and efficiently delivers it to the glass.\n\nEvery organization’s needs are very different, so we want to work with you to drive the right value at the right price, without the fear of overages or huge price hikes when your data complexity inevitably grows.\n\nFor the Chronosphere Telemetry Pipeline, we follow a straightforward pricing model, based solely on data throughput – the volume of raw data you transmit through the pipeline. We understand that every team’s needs are different, so we work with you to drive the right value at the right price.\n\nWe offer a flexible support model to meet your needs. We have dedicated customer success resources and offer 24/7 x 365 communications by Slack, Zendesk, or e-mail, in addition to options for weekly office hours, ad-hoc calls, and shared Slack channels. You are assigned a customer success architect, solution architect, and account executive that you’ll have direct access to.\n\nAre you a customer needing to access our team or get a question answered? Reach out to our support team here, and someone will be with you ASAP!\n\nDue to the highly customized nature of each organization’s observability aggregation and rollup needs, we will work with you to stand up a pilot. The onboarding process depends on the scale of the deployment, but the goal is to prove out the required capabilities.\n\nPilots are typically free, unless you are running a large scale or long term pilot. The average pilot is 2-3 weeks long, during which you’ll be able to try out Chronosphere with your actual production data, with longer-term evaluations possible (most likely a paid pilot for long durations of evaluation).\n\nWe will work with you to tune control plane policies, define different resolution, and retention policies specific to your needs, and you will have full access to the same support you’d get as a Chronosphere customer. Ready to start a pilot? Click here to speak to our experts about your needs.\n\nThe Chronosphere collector is responsible for ingesting metrics and traces from a customer’s various applications and then sending them along to the Chronosphere backend. It is the only Chronosphere software deployed in customer environments. You can set up as many collectors as you need.\n\nFor a full explanation of how it works, check out our blog post on how Chronosphere collects metrics.\n\nChronosphere is a flexible SaaS solution, built for scaling cloud native engineering organizations.\n\nThe Chronosphere platform can ingest metrics and distributed trace data in a variety of open source formats, as well as Chronosphere collector instances which are the only pieces of technology that needs to be deployed by customers.The datastore and dashboards are fully provided and managed by Chronosphere.\n\nCustomers can manage their configuration through our Terraform provider or a command-line tool, in addition to through the UI.\n\nWe have a 99.9% SLA, calculated on a per-tenant basis.\n\nAvailability is determined continuously and automatically by monitoring for tenant downtime by having an external probe write a randomly generated datapoint and read it back, to verify that the platform is successfully persisting data and the whole end to end flow is working.\n\nWe calculate the SLA specifically for your tenant, not everyone, with a focus on the ability to read and write data.\n\nLearn more about our Commitment to Availability.\n\nChronosphere Telemetry Pipeline follows a hybrid or bring your own cloud (BYOC) architecture pattern by default. This means the data plane (where data processing occurs) is deployed in your environment, while Chronosphere hosts the management plane (where commands are issued).\n\nThis deployment model allows for rapid deployment of multiple core instances within different environments or clouds. For example, you can have five Telemetry Pipeline core instances deployed across Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, your private data center, and even your laptop.\n\nTelemetry Pipeline does not require any inbound network connections and instead only require a single outbound connection the management plane\n\nThis architecture gives the following advantages:\n\nFaster processing and lower latency: When the data plane is deployed closer to the data source, there are less latency and network hops required.\n\nIncreased data privacy: With data collection and processing staying within the environment, there is less risk of data leaking out of the environment outside of its sovereignty or compliance boundary. Chronosphere has no access to the underlying data.\n\nCost optimization: When data is processed (mainly reduced or removed) within your environment this can vastly decrease your bandwidth and egress charges within public cloud environments.",

      "# [Control your data](https://docs.chronosphere.io/control)\nYour app generates a lot of data, but not all of it's useful. Storing every byte is costly, and can quickly overwhelm your capacity limit, license limit, or both. Aside from financial cost, there's computing cost associated with generating, processing, and temporarily storing your telemetry data.\n\nReducing data volume keeps costs predictable and manageable as your business scales, and helps teams manage their data effectively by reducing the amount of available information. When you optimize your data, on-call engineers can find the data they need to solve problems faster.\n\nTo take control of your data, Chronosphere Observability Platform provides multiple tools you can use to identify and eliminate data that isn't used and doesn't deliver value to your business. See Chronosphere control concepts to learn about the mechanisms you can use to control your data.\n\nUnderstand consumption and limits\n\nManage license consumption by reviewing licensing dashboards to identify usage trends and avoid exceeding your organization's licensing limits.\n\nUnderstand data limits for each telemetry type to ensure a performant experience when ingesting, querying, and creating resources.\n\nShape metric data\n\nUse the Chronosphere Control Plane to shape your metric data and reduce the amount of data you persist. Manage your data with tools that help you shape that traffic, such as creating drop rules, quotas, and aggregation rules.\n\nSample trace data\n\nCreate trace datasets that map tracing license consumption to relevant business units in your organization. Datasets let you track and measure data usage over time before you implement sampling strategies, whereas head and tail sampling alone require you to measure and implement together.",
      "# [Overview of alerting](https://docs.chronosphere.io/alerts)\nOne reason to ingest and store time series data is to know when data does or doesn't meet certain criteria. To generate alerts and notifications from data, regardless of whether it's about your system or about your use of Chronosphere Observability Platform itself, use alerting.\n\nYou create monitors to query time series, and optionally group results into signals. Whenever a time series meets a condition, an alert triggers that sends a notification. You can mute notifications with muting rules.\n\nMonitors\n\nObservability Platform alerting revolves around monitors. You can watch time series data that's specified in a monitor query. The results of a monitor query can be time series data or the outcome of a function applied to time series data. Because Observability Platform is a single data store, you can merge alerts, which lets an alert query all metrics and not only metrics local to a Prometheus instance.\n\nConditions\n\nConditions are evaluations run against every time series from the resulting monitor query, along with a related severity, such as critical or warning. For example, conditions can help you determine if a time series value remains greater than 1 for more than 30 seconds. If this happens, Observability Platform can display a warning alert.\n\nYou can also specify condition overrides to override the default conditions that define when an alert triggers for a monitor.\n\nSignals\n\nSignals are optional groupings by label of the results returned from a monitor query. For example, you can use signals to group time series from multiple environments, such as development or production, to generate separate alerts for each environment.\n\nIn Observability Platform, on the Monitors page, monitors with defined signals display the file tree icon. To view the signals from a displayed monitor, click the name of the monitor from the list.\n\nObservability Platform supports converting from Prometheus alerts to signals, and strongly recommends using signals instead of configuring complex routing trees to route notifications:\n\nYou can configure signals for individual monitors, which isolates changes to only that monitor. Prometheus requires a single global configuration, and any change impacts users across your entire organization.\n\nSignals let you group notifications within the monitor itself, rather than grouping notifications within the notification routing tree. This model makes signals easier to manage as part of a monitor configuration.\n\nAlerts\n\nAlerts occur when one or more monitor query results trigger a condition. Configuring the monitor signal to group query results generates an alert for each signal that triggers a condition.\n\nNotifications\n\nWhen an alert triggers, and optionally when an alert resolves, Observability Platform sends a notification to specified endpoints called notifiers, including PagerDuty, email, and Slack. You configure your notifications with notification policies.\n\nMuting rules\n\nUsing Observability Platform, you can temporarily mute notifications for a triggered alert. These muting rules can apply to:",

      "# [Ingest telemetry data](https://docs.chronosphere.io/ingest)\nBefore you can use Chronosphere Observability Platform to view and manage your observability data (of whatever type), you need to get that data into Observability Platform.\n\nObservability Platform supports multiple methods to ingest telemetry data, which depend on which type of data you want to ingest:\n\nIngestion methodChange eventsLogsMetricsTracesChronosphere CollectorOpenTelemetry CollectorTelemetry Pipeline or Core AgentExisting pipelineDirect to Observability Platform\n\nAfter ingesting telemetry data, you can use the control mechanisms that Observability Platform provides to control costs and ensure you're ingesting only the data you care about.\n\nChronosphere utilizes push and pull models of ingestion, depending on the data collected and the method of ingestion.\n\nPull models, like the Chronosphere Collector, scrape data from external sources and pull it in. These metrics have consistent reporting intervals.\n\nPush models, like tracing, send data to Chronosphere, which is then processed. These metrics can have a broad spectrum of reporting frequency, from large bursts of data to long periods with no data reporting.\n\nTelemetryPushPullMetricsTracesLogs\n\nThe ingestion model depends on the data source. Metrics pushed to Observability Platform can have latency delays or sparse time series which can result in unexpected query results.\n\nMetric and trace data\n\nTo ingest metrics and traces, you must configure one of the collection methods. Use the Chronosphere Collector or OpenTelemetry Collector for metric and trace data. Google Cloud metrics can also be directly ingested.\n\nChange event data\n\nChange event data gets sent directly to Observability Platform, and doesn't require an independent collection mechanism. Use Observability Platform or CreateEvent API to send your change events (opens in a new tab).\n\nYou can also ingest change events directly from supported third-party tools such as Amazon EventBridge, Buildkite, and LaunchDarkly.\n\nLog data\n\nTo ingest log data, Chronosphere recommends using Core Agent or a combination of Core Agent plus Telemetry Pipeline. Chronosphere also supports using your existing ingest pipeline to ingest log data, such as Fluent Bit or LogStash. You can also ingest log data using the OpenTelemetry Collector.\n\nControl costs\n\nIngesting more telemetry data increases your overall data and storage costs.

      "# [Chronoctl](https://docs.chronosphere.io/chronoctl)\nChronoctl is a Chronosphere-supplied app that lets you manage your organization's Chronosphere Observability Platform resources from the command line.\n\nFor example, to list your team's monitor definitions:\n\nGetting started\n\nTo install Chronoctl, see Install Chronoctl.\n\nTo use Chronoctl, you must provide an API token and organization name to authenticate as an account with administrative privileges, either by configuring them as environment variables or passing them with the command. You can also securely authenticate by using the chronoctl auth command.\n\nAfter you're ready to use Chronoctl, refer to its commands to directly control your Observability Platform environment.\n\nSupported resources\n\nUse Chronoctl commands to take actions on Observability Platform resources, such as dashboards, teams, or collections. To display a list of the resources supported by your installed version of Chronoctl, view the Chronoctl help:\n\nThe list of available resources displays in the Chronosphere Configuration section of the output.\n\nCommand list\n\nRequires Chronoctl version 0.53.0 or later.\n\nChronoctl is based on the structure of the Chronosphere API, which helps its commands be as consistent with one another as possible. This also better reflects features as they're presented for use in the Chronosphere API itself.\n\nFlags\n\nEach command has several flags for customizing its output or behavior.\n\nIn addition to the authentication flags, flags that are common among commands include:\n\n-h, --help: Outputs help text for the given command.\n\n--timeout: Defines a duration in seconds for the request before it times out and fails. Defaults to 30 seconds.\n\nChronoctl commands that return data representations of resources have additional common flags:\n\n-o, --output: Defines the output format. Accepts json for JSON, jsonl for JSON Lines, or defaults to yaml for YAML.\n\nChronoctl commands that can change the state of a resource in Observability Platform, such as chronoctl apply or resource create and update subcommands, also have:\n\n-d, --dry-run: If set, Chronoctl simulates but doesn't apply the manifest or change in a dry run, and then displays the predicted result.\n\n--no-strict: If set, Chronoctl accepts manifests or changes that contain unknown fields.\n\nSlugs\n\nObservability Platform identifies each resource by a unique slug, which has a 255-character length limit and contains only letters, numbers, underscores (_), and dashes (-). Slugs are case-sensitive. By default, Observability Platform generates a random slug (containing less than 255 characters) for each resource. Chronoctl lets you optionally specify a slug when creating resources.\n\nConfiguration commands\n\nConfiguration commands are the recommended way to interact with Observability Platform resources. Use the apply command for interacting with multiple resources, but in most cases, uses the configuration commands.\n\nEach of these commands are specific to Observability Platform resource types, which have the same following subcommands:\n\ncreate\n\ndelete\n\nlist\n\nread\n\nscaffold\n\nupdate\n\ncreate\n\nCreates one resource of the given type. For example:\n\nReplace the following:\n\nRESOURCE: The resource you want to take action on.\n\nFILE_NAME: The name of the definition file you want to use.\n\nFor more information about the subcommand, including its usage and accepted flags, see the Chronoctl command line help.\n\nReplace RESOURCE with the resource you want to take action on.\n\ndelete\n\nDeletes one resource of the given type. For example:\n\nReplace the following:\n\nRESOURCE: The resource you want to take action on.\n\nSLUG: The slug of the resource you want to delete.\n\nFor more information about the subcommand, including its usage and accepted flags, see the Chronoctl command line help.\n\nReplace RESOURCE with the resource you want to take action on.\n\nlist\n\nLists all resources of the given type. For example:\n\nReplace RESOURCE with the resource you want to take action on.\n\nFor more information about the subcommand, including its usage and accepted flags, see the Chronoctl command line help.\n\nReplace RESOURCE with the resource you want to take action on.\n\nread\n\nOutputs one resource of the given type.

For example:\n\nReplace RESOURCE with the resource you want to take action on.\n\nupdate\n\nUpdates a resource of the given type. For example:\n\nReplace the following:\n\nRESOURCE: The resource you want to take action on.\n\nFILE_NAME: The name of the definition file you want to use.\n\nFor more information about the subcommand, including its usage and accepted flags, see the Chronoctl command line help.\n\nReplace RESOURCE with the resource you want to take action on.\n\nCore commands\n\nChronoctl core commands are independent of any resource type.\n\napply\n\nApplies a configuration change to resources from a YAML or JSON file, or from standard input. When you apply resources with Chronoctl, Observability Platform creates them if they don't already exist.\n\nThe apply command accepts input from a file by providing the path as the value of the -f (--filename) flag.\n\nFor example, to apply a file containing a resource's YAML manifest:\n\nTo apply a resource passed from standard input, use the - value of the -f flag:\n\nUpon success, the command returns the list of changes applied.\n\nThe apply command accepts the dry run (-d, --dry-run) flag, which displays the changes without applying them.\n\nauth\n\nRequires Chronoctl version 1.8.0 or later (or Chronoctl 0.65.0 or later if you're using a version earlier than 1.0.0).\n\nHandles secure programmatic access to Observability Platform. This command lets users access their organizations' applications after authentication with Chronoctl.\n\nlogin: Authenticate the Chronoctl session as your Observability Platform user.\n\nlist: List all authenticated Observability Platform organizations the current user can access. Users might have access to multiple organizations such as a production and a test organization.\n\nprint-session-id: Print the stored session id for an Observability Platform organization.\n\nset-default-org: Sets the default Observability Platform organization for future commands.\n\nTo sign in, use this command:\n\nReplace YOUR-ORG-NAME with the organization you want to sign in to. For example, if your Observability Platform tenant is https://acme.chronosphere.io, replace YOUR-ORG-NAME with acme, and then follow the prompts.\n\nThis process generates a session_ID, which is cached on your machine and valid for 24 hours. If a personal access token or service account token isn't passed to Chronoctl using an environment variable or command line flag, Chronoctl uses the cached session_ID to authenticate your command.\n\nState commands\n\nThese commands evaluate the current state of Observability Platform.\n\nrule-evaluations list\n\nThe list subcommand is the only subcommand for rule-evaluations.\n\nReturns a list of rule evaluation failures, including the rule's type, slug, failure count, message, and detection timestamp.\n\nSync commands\n\nThe sync command accepts the prometheus subcommand only. Use the sync prometheus command to sync a Prometheus rules YAML file and a Prometheus Alertmanager YAML configuration file into Chronosphere format.\n\nYou include a chronoconfig.yaml file to assign the rules to a team, and to specify a team to own the related notification policy. This command converts and applies the assets and resources to your tenant.\n\nTo sync Prometheus rules into Chronosphere format:\n\nDefine a chronoconfig.yaml file to assign the converted rules to a team, and specify a team to own the related notification policy:\n\nuse_collections:\"TRUE\" group_teams: - group_regex:\".*\" team_slug:\"OWNER_TEAM\" notification_policy_team_slug:\"POLICY_TEAM\"\n\nReplace the following:\n\nOWNER_TEAM: The slug of the Observability Platform team to own the converted rules.\n\nPOLICY_TEAM: The slug of the Observability Platform team to own the notification policy.\n\nRun the sync prometheus command and pass in your Prometheus rules file, Prometheus Alertmanager configuration file, and chronoconfig.yaml file:\n\nchronoctlsyncprometheus-a [ALERTMANAGER_CONFIG] -p [PROM_RULES] -c chronoconfig.yaml [FLAGS]\n\nReplace the following:\n\nALERTMANAGER_CONFIG: The file containing your Prometheus Alertmanager configuration.\n\nPROM_RULES: The file containing your Prometheus rules.\n\nFLAGS: Any flags to include with the command.

From my unsophisticated perspective, it appears that Grafana is the first mover in the space (meaning they were the first to raise VC funding and the are now valued the most (recently valued at $6 BN) vs Chronosphere which is now valued at $1 BN; however with the rapid growth of the market—is the market big enough for multiple players. And can companies like Grafana grow beyond the niche confines of the observability market? Can larger companies like Elastic displace smaller companies or are they complementary?\n\nBeyond these high level questions—how are these companies to work with? Are they easy to work with and put the customer first? How aggressive are they in moving customers to paying for premium services?\n\nAny thoughts and feedback are welcome and appreciated!!\n\n## Comment ID i3zp80t with +4 score by [(raptorjesus69, Reddit, 2022-04-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/grafana/comments/tzdvak/grafana_vs_chronosphere_vs_cribl/i3zp80t/) (in reply to ID tzdvak):\nThe other thing that sets grafana apart from the other two is grafana contributes much more to open source then the other companies.

Cribl specializes in getting data into the platform of your choice while chronosphere and Grafana are data analytics engines with a lot of focus on metrics. Cribl and Grafana are all very easy to work with large free tiers. I don’t have a ton of experience working with Chronosphere. The demo looks good, but their focus is too narrow for me. I don’t know if it has free tier. I want metrics and traces not just metrics. Grafana has some nice features but needs more analytics options and I would prefer options for security to use it as well. Cribl is a great option to scale your staff and gather pretty much any data for your analytics backends you can route your data anywhere and are not limited by your vendors at all. If you want to use one agent and route the same event to Grafana/ELK and Splunk for different use cases not a problem. Makes it all very easy and you can shape your data anyway you want. From an architecture POV I like decoupling data collection/management from your analytics platforms. Makes it easy to use whatever data platform you want and not feel stuck.  Cribl supports any data use case so operations/o11y/security use cases are no problem.",

We found that datadog is still actually fairly affordable all things considered. When you factor the amount of time we would spend maintaining the stack internally, or compare to the costs of other fully supported third party services with similar feature sets, it ended up being a sort of wash.\n\nIn the end we still use datadog because it doesn't cost disproportionately higher than the other options and because it provides a single pane of glass for all kinds of engineers across all parts of the BU (network folks, security folks, kubernetes folks, vcenter folks, DBAs, data analysts)\n\n### Comment ID jtqnxfy with +3 score by [(cryonine, Reddit, 2023-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/15b1057/datadog_costs_that_high/jtqnxfy/) (in reply to ID jtnqoys):\nAgree with this take. The biggest thing with Datadog is having a good framework around what metrics you bring in and training engineers on how to properly leverage metrics. In our old self-hosted system we brought in tons and tons of metrics that literally no one used and had questionable value. When we brought those apps into Datadog we figured out what we did and didn’t need based on what engineers looked at, figured out if they actually make sense, and helped people implement them.\n\nEventually we had a squad that was tasked to build a custom module that wrapped the DD logger. This had various safeguards and best practices we developed internally to act as guardrails. At the end of the day the cost was more than manageable and the data was meaningful.\n\nSimilar things with logging and tracing. We took in all traces, but we rarely retained any because it wasn’t necessary. Logs were indexed only if they were security-related and the rest were dumped to S3. We had ways for engineers to watch real-time logs elsewhere.\n\nDD costs are often times only astronomical if your organization doesn’t take the time to create meaningful metrics. You rarely need *all* the data, haha.\n\n#### Comment ID jtuhpgn with +2 score by [(salynch, Reddit, 2023-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/15b1057/datadog_costs_that_high/jtuhpgn/) (in reply to ID jtqnxfy):\nYou might find this Twitter thread resonates, as well: https://twitter.com/roskilli/status/1684351974559596544\n\n## Comment ID jtuhii4 with +3 score by [(salynch, Reddit, 2023-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/15b1057/datadog_costs_that_high/jtuhii4/) (in reply to ID 15b1057):\nThis has been covered a lot, and continues to come up:\n\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/sre/comments/rhko5f/what\\_you\\_use\\_for\\_observability/](https://www.reddit.com/r/sre/comments/rhko5f/what_you_use_for_observability/) \n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/wytllq/what\\_your\\_observability\\_stack\\_in\\_2022\\_looks\\_like/](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/wytllq/what_your_observability_stack_in_2022_looks_like/)\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/sre/comments/10wcomt/where\\_to\\_store\\_highcardinality\\_metrics/](https://www.reddit.com/r/sre/comments/10wcomt/where_to_store_highcardinality_metrics/)   \n\n...and Matt Duggan's recent blog post [Monitoring is a Pain](https://matduggan.com/were-all-doing-metrics-wrong/) discusses some interesting thoughts on this, as well.\n\nu/paigerduty at Chronosphere has [written about](https://thenewstack.io/conversations-im-sick-of-having-about-observability/) the brokenness of some observability cost models, when you hit a certain scale.\n\n## Comment ID jtteuxs with +3 score by [(GilderoyLockhartt, Reddit, 2023-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/15b1057/datadog_costs_that_high/jtteuxs/) (in reply to ID 15b1057):\nits not always about datadog.. all saas gets expensive when the org scale..

Companies like Chronosphere ([https://chronosphere.io/](https://chronosphere.io/)) allow for granular controls on what is getting ingressed, what is getting stored as well looking at overall usage to understand patterns to optimize.

One the really big problems with telemetry is as your org gets larger its starts to become extremely difficult manage over usage. Teams will not prioritize metrics/log clean up or worse they will assign it to the junior/bottom engineer. I spent months fighting with teams at a large retail company to get metrics and logs under control. This only really got fixed when we had to eat a 6 figure overage charge, though in that case a lot of teams just gutted there logs/metrics as they would rather fly blind than actually manage their integrations.   \n\n\nI led 2 massive telemetry migrations at that same company and what I learned is most engineers have not idea how logs/metrics/traces work at even a basic level. Teams will again try and assign the junior or bottom engineer to this work causing more problems. I had to explain the concept of cardinality in metrics at least once a week for over a year at one point.\n\n### Comment ID jtof908 with +6 score by [(thecurlyburl, Reddit, 2023-07-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/15b1057/datadog_costs_that_high/jtof908/) (in reply to ID jtoaecp):\nHaha oh man. Cardinality is definitely one of those things where the person either gets it or they nod and will never get it.

Lina's stun is a unit, too. Mirana's arrow and pudge's hook, too.\n\nMany spells use units. Some of them are just accepted as a spell effect, rather than a unit. MK's soldiers fall in that category, since you have 0 control over them. They might as well be piles of particles randomly dealing damage to units within 300 range of them based on MK's attack damage.\n\nAnyway, Chronosphere does not affect invulnerable heroes.

Way better than chrono imo since you can't fail it hard, and you need too much to kill any hero 1v1 during regular chrono, also you can't always place chronosphere perfectly, but with timezone it's a lot easier to use ulti and kill enemy hero(es) just with your lane supp or any ganker with buffs time zone provides.\n\n### Comment ID lgsre93 with +20 score by [(xKnuTx, Reddit, 2024-08-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1elh9g7/promise_me_you_wont_freak_out_time_zone_has_a/lgsre93/) (in reply to ID lgs49de):\neven prior to this patch i think time zone was more consitant first of all you can´t fail it and 100% of teams like time zone while chrono can be the best abilty in the game or rather mid depeding on competion. second an imo even more importend. Faceless void can lose lanes impossible hard and never recover. and if you cant kill people in chrono because you are to poor your game is basically impossible. at that point you pretty much turned into a support and you will not deal any meaningful damage until min 50. and you are just a chorono bot. time zonge gives you so much damage you can kill people if played correctly while with chrono if you dont kill someone inside chorno there is no real way of playing better.\n\n#### Comment ID lgut29a with +6 score by [(CrushingK, Reddit, 2024-08-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1elh9g7/promise_me_you_wont_freak_out_time_zone_has_a/lgut29a/) (in reply to ID lgsre93):\nplenty of games you need to bkb inside chrono so it makes no real difference, chrono is an unfair advantage but timezone is simply more consistant and produces similar results with none of the drawbacks.

Treads - MoM/Diffusal/Mage slayer (depends on your need to purchase Disperser, but overall I like diffusal more than MoM, because i just don't like MoM, also tried mage slayer in 3 matches against a lot of magic damage in enemy team, works decent) - Manta (it's especially good against with diffusal and any ranged enemy carry, since you can dodge all projectiles after time zone ends) - Mjolnir (if you can afford to purchase maelstrom before manta for farming - it's better to do so) - BKB - Skadi/Butterfly/Damage.  \nNullifier sometimes, if needed. Bought refresher once, usually go for agh's blessing instead, but I guess Refresher might be good too, bkb and ulti refreshes are always good, can't say a lot about that, since 20 games isn't enough  \nedit: overall i can say that Void with timezone is not a hard carry as it is with chrono, you have to participate in many fights as possible in midgame, ulti is much more teamplay-wise skill and hero is becoming more midgame-oriented with this aspect, losing such a hard disable hits to your late late game really hard, but as for me, I would rather pick Time Zone now, especially since they removed that little buff for time walk from a Chrono aspect\n\n### Comment ID lgtpvax with +1 score by [(xjiwolf, Reddit, 2024-08-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1elh9g7/promise_me_you_wont_freak_out_time_zone_has_a/lgtpvax/) (in reply to ID lgs49de):\nMay I ask what bracket are you playing?\n\n#### Comment ID lgupgev with +1 score by [(Erealim, Reddit, 2024-08-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1elh9g7/promise_me_you_wont_freak_out_time_zone_has_a/lgupgev/) (in reply to ID lgtpvax):\nLegend\n\n## Comment ID lgs18oc with +16 score by [(ExO_o, Reddit, 2024-08-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1elh9g7/promise_me_you_wont_freak_out_time_zone_has_a/lgs18oc/) (in reply to ID 1elh9g7):\nI'm really freaking out.\n\n### Comment ID lgs1fo8 with +4 score by [(dota2_responses_bot, Reddit, 2024-08-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1elh9g7/promise_me_you_wont_freak_out_time_zone_has_a/lgs1fo8/) (in reply to ID lgs18oc):\n[I'm really freaking out.](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dota2_gamepedia/images/e/e3/Vo_treant_treant_freakout.mp3) (sound warning: Treant Protector)\n\n---\nBleep bloop, I am a robot. *OP can reply with \"Try hero_name\" to update this with new hero*\n\n[*^(Source)*](https://github.com/Jonarzz/DotaResponsesRedditBot) *^(|)* \n[*^(Suggestions/Issues)*](https://github.com/Jonarzz/DotaResponsesRedditBot/issues/new/choose) *^(|)* \n[*^(Maintainer)*](https://www.reddit.com/user/MePsyDuck/) *^(|)* \n[*^(Author)*](https://www.reddit.com/user/Jonarz/)\n\n### Comment ID lgtlm43 with +1 score by [(TheBurningSoda, Reddit, 2024-08-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1elh9g7/promise_me_you_wont_freak_out_time_zone_has_a/lgtlm43/) (in reply to ID lgs18oc):\nI also freak out when someone on the internet shows me statistics\n\n## Comment ID lgrpqg6 with +13 score by [(Darkhrono, Reddit, 2024-08-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1elh9g7/promise_me_you_wont_freak_out_time_zone_has_a/lgrpqg6/) (in reply to ID 1elh9g7):\nas off is really good, i played a game were my cores were melee (ursa and shaker), we just snowballed them\n\n## Comment ID lgrts3j with +101 score by [(Erikaa-, Reddit, 2024-08-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1elh9g7/promise_me_you_wont_freak_out_time_zone_has_a/lgrts3j/) (in reply to ID 1elh9g7):\nStats like this has always been misleading, since Chrono had almost 4 times the pick rate of Time Zone, meaning Time Zone has 2% higher winrate even in the situation that favors it (No Ember, No Puck, No Centaur, No Anti-Mage, etc)\n\n### Comment ID lgs06qc with +37 score by [(monsj, Reddit, 2024-08-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1elh9g7/promise_me_you_wont_freak_out_time_zone_has_a/lgs06qc/) (in reply to ID lgrts3j):\nThe heroes that counters it are dark seer, weaver and centaur.

I don't feel like anyone plays void as well as he does.  I was really disappointed when they didn't have him play it in the third game.  I think engima was also a pretty greedy pick.  I would rather have seen them pick something that doesn't have such a long ultimate cd.  They're obviously going to ward the jungle camps if you pick enigma, and so far I haven't really seen an enigma successfully ancient.\n\nThe enigma pick in general made their lanes really weak as well as their teamfight.  Relying on a super long cd ultimate is not wise in the current meta imo and it's kind of redundant when you have a chronosphere. I'm not sure if it was banned, but even tide would have been better imo and at least he could have successfully killed the ancients.\n\n### Comment ID cj3epog with +1 score by [(smog_alado, Reddit, 2014-07-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/2b9g0t/universes_perfect_chronosphere/cj3epog/) (in reply to ID cj3ek9k):\ndunno about tide.

Before you just needed to be a creep killer that could make great decisions in the late game, nowadays you'll sometimes have to do that, sometimes play a tempo controller more akin to a 6.77 mid, or even straight up utility if your lane is sacked. It's really interesting to see how the role has evolved in this meta, it'll be cool to see how it all shakes out in the post-ti patch and meta. \n\nI also don't think any of those players actually played that badly, there were just numerous times for each of them where their lanes were abandoned in favor of securing farm for the mid and offlaner.

It completely stops everyone and everything (creeps heroes towers etc.) thats caught in it. So what u would want is to catch as many enemy heroes and a little allies as possible so your allies are outside and free to attack while the enemy is stopped inside this sphere. Here UNiVeRsE managed to catch 3 of the enemies right at the edge and have no allies inside. This is very hard to achieve with everyone moving in fights and risks catching no one if he was a split second late and they all moved a little outwards.

He used to have a long range time walk a passive bash, and a passive skill that dodged damage. He would leap in, cast crono and a 3k networth Rubick could just sit behind his team with blink, steal the crono, cast it on top of voids crono and it would entirely counter the hero. Void was played only as a hard carry back then, and it basically ment that in competitive DotA void was unplayable because of the interaction with Rubick.

On the other hand, these days Faceless Void has another active spell he could use to prevent this scenario, so I'm not sure it's even necessary to arbitrarily dick over Rubick anymore. If he steals Chrono and counterinitiates, he has every right to render FV useless.\n\nAt the time it was the right decision, but it was also made for another iteration of Faceless Void.

Blackhole has a 180 sec CD without AGHS. The ability goes through BKB, linkins, and is a 4 second disable to whoever is captured inside. Your whole team can dish out damage during this time. Chronosphere is 80 sec CD without an AGHS. This ability also goes through all forms of magic immunity but only Faceless Void can deal damage inside of it. However, his team can also throw in spells inside the chrono if they are not captured inside the chrono. A 100 sec CD difference and in my opinion Chrono is WAY too good to have an 80 second CD. I feel like Blackhole should have a 120 sec CD or Chrono should go to 100 and 80 secs with AGHS.

      "# [Chronosphere Acquires Calyptia, Creators of Leading Observability Pipeline Solutions on 2024-01-22](https://chronosphere.io/news/chronosphere-acquires-calyptia/)\nCompany to Integrate Calyptia’s Capabilities with its Observability Platform while Continuing Support of Open Source Projects\n\nNEW YORK – January 22, 2024 – Chronosphere, the leading cloud native observability platform, announced that it has acquired Calyptia, a leading provider of observability pipeline solutions. Chronosphere will integrate Calyptia’s core technology, which provides log transformation and optimization capabilities, into the company’s cloud native observability platform.\n\nCalyptia is founded by the original creators of the Fluent Ecosystem, which includes the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) graduated projects Fluent Bit and Fluentd. The vendor-agnostic Fluent projects are lightweight and highly scalable log processors. They allow organizations to collect telemetry from multiple sources and distribute them to any defined destination. With more than 12 billion downloads, Fluent Bit is the preferred logging processor for cloud native environments. As part of its ongoing commitment to open source, Chronosphere will continue to invest in the Fluent projects and community.\n\nCalyptia’s observability pipeline product is built on top of Fluent Bit. The addition of this pipeline to Chronosphere’s platform enables the routing, transformation, and optimization of log data at scale. With these new capabilities, teams have a central interface to:\n\nControl costs at the source by not having to send the data they don’t need. Intelligent built-in filters can reduce volumes by 30% or more.\n\nProvide additional context by enriching data or improve security by redacting data – all in flight, before the data is stored at its destination.\n\nAnalyze log data in realtime while it’s being collected instead of waiting for it to be stored and indexed, allowing developers to quickly debug production impacting issues.\n\nChronosphere also recently announced its new log storage and visualization functionality, Logs powered by Crowdstrike. With both announcements, Chronosphere customers now have end-to-end logging capabilities in addition to the rest of the observability platform.\n\n“With observability data growing by orders of magnitude, companies are ill-equipped to manage the costs and scale of this deluge, forcing their teams to make trade-offs. Teams are especially challenged to handle log data which is prohibitively expensive to move and store,” said Martin Mao, CEO and Co-Founder, Chronosphere. “With the addition of Calyptia’s leading observability pipeline solution, we’re taking an important step to ensure that developers have the ultimate control over all their observability data from end to end—including log files to control cost and improve developer productivity.”\n\n“We are excited to join the Chronosphere team, which shares our passion and history of innovation in helping companies transform their approach to observability,” said Eduardo Silva, Founder, Calyptia. “We look forward to combining our solutions to make observability even more effective and more cost efficient, for any type of company and every telemetry data type. We’re excited to continue building and supporting the Fluent Ecosystem as an open source and vendor neutral solution.”\n\n“Calyptia joining the Chronosphere team is excellent news for everyone who is invested in the future of open source cloud native technology,” said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). “In today’s world, anyone that doesn’t adopt open source technology risks being left behind. I’m excited to see how the Fluentd and Fluent Bit projects will continue to grow and evolve as more end users embrace the capabilities of cloud native observability.”\n\nAdditional Resources:",

My name is Paul Nashawaty, I’m the Practice Lead for the AppDev practice at The Futurum Group. I’m joined today by Chronosphere’s CEO, Martin Mao, to talk about the recent partnership with CrowdStrike and their recent acquisition of Calyptia. But before that, Martin, let’s talk a little bit about Chronosphere. What’s that all about?\n\nMartin Mao: Yeah, for sure. Paul, thank you for having me on the show. Chronosphere is a cloud native observability company. We provide an observability platform, you can imagine insights into your infrastructure, into your application, into your business. In particular, we provide it for companies adopting cloud native architecture or running on cloud native environments. For us, what’s different about Chronosphere is we’re really trying to solve the pain points that arise when you try to tackle observability in a cloud native environment.\n\nReally, there’s two pain points there. One is cost: It’s very expensive to monitor and observe these cloud native environments, there’s a lot of data and the cost is pretty high, the associated cost is pretty high when it comes to observability. The second part is that these environments are pretty complex, and hence it’s much harder to solve problems and figure out what’s going on. Those are the two problems that we try to target and do a better job at, here at Chronosphere.\n\nPaul Nashawaty: That’s really exciting. It’s really interesting, when I think about my area of coverage. I focus on day zero, day one, day two, so build, release and operations. When I think about the impact in the CIC pipeline and the impact to the devops teams and such, it really does matter about how quickly you can resolve issues and seeing how these things happen. But it also matters about the security and all the aspects that go along with it. But when we look at all the aspects of observability, as we were going through it in what Chronosphere does, this recent announcement with CrowdStrike, so you have logs powered by CrowdStrike.\n\nIt’s really catchy and it really drives to that log storage and virtualization solution that you have, which I really think is amazing. I’ve been following Chronosphere for quite some time, and I’ve loved to see your growth and where you’re going. But this embedded CrowdStrike Falcon LogScale within the Chronosphere cloud native observability platform, how does it really help your clients, and why CrowdStrike in particular?\n\nMartin Mao: Yeah, 100%. I would say in the first part, the whole industry is moving towards a single unified platform for observability these days, whereas a few years ago, you would perhaps have a log management solution separate from your APM separate from your infrastructure monitoring software. Really, all those tools are used to solve one use case these days, so what really the industry’s looking for is all of that in one. The very first thing that this does is it helps us complete the platform by adding log management capabilities there.\n\nIn particular we chose CrowdStrike because, for our customer base, we serve some of the largest, most complex companies in the world, and they have huge scale requirements and performance requirements for their log management capabilities. For us, CrowdStrike checks those boxes extremely well. It’s highly scalable, so it can handle petabytes and petabytes of data, while also having performance against all of that data as well. For us, it was not only completing the platform, but also the right technology, the right log management technology to power that side for all of the existing Chronosphere customers and the companies that we work with.\n\nPaul Nashawaty: It sounds interesting, and the reason it does is when I think about observability as a practice, there was a running, I call it a joke, for a while there that the observability practice was basically a glorified storage admin, because basically all they did was just collect a bunch of data and didn’t know what to do with it.\n\nMartin Mao: Yeah.\n\nPaul Nashawaty: You did this alerting, and monitoring, and logging, but that’s really the immature stages of observability practices. With just alerts and monitoring, you really can see what’s happening but with those actionable insights really is really what matters. When you look at it from the perspective of maturity, there is different levels of maturity within organizations, both large and small. You have SMBs or large enterprises that may have observability practices that can fully mature, taking actionable insights on everything that’s going on. Or being at the very, very early stages and saying, “Okay, well we have this red light, yellow light, green light approach that happens, and we know what’s happening but we don’t know what to do about it.”\n\nI definitely like the CrowdStrike partnership. It definitely ties things together to do that, that logging and tracing all the way through the entire ecosystem and try to figure it out so that’s really powerful. Again, the other side of it is the actionable insights. You can feed that into the CICD pipeline very easily now, with having that information. But speaking of developers and devops and such, Calyptia, what’s all this about? You have Chronosphere, you recently acquired Calyptia. They’re the original creators of the fluent ecosystem, as you know. I don’t have to tell you that, you already know that. Why is this strategic for Chronosphere?\n\nMartin Mao: Yeah, 100%. For those that don’t know, Calyptia provide a telemetry pipeline, so it’s the ingestion and the transformation of a lot of telemetry or observability data, including logs, and metrics, and traces, before it goes to a back end. The main reason for us to do that is, I mentioned in my introduction, that one of the problems that Chronosphere wants to solve is the cost problem of observability. It’s a huge pain point for a lot of those in the industry right now. The way for us to solve the cost problem is not by just making it cheaper, that’s a losing battle there. But for us, the way we approach it is we actually want to understand the cost of all the data and cost accounted back to an individual team or a particular use case.\n\nThat cost, by the way, is not easy to figure out. A line of instrumentation may cost you $1 million a year, that same line may cost you $1. When you’re instrumenting it, you actually don’t know how much it’s going to cost you. We show you that cost, but we also marry that cost with the value of the data. We also want you to understand how you’re using the data, and what sets of data is valuable and not valuable. You can imagine, with both sides of that equation, we can identify what’s expensive but not valuable, and help you figure out what data is and isn’t valuable to you and how much you’re spending on it. You can imagine with that data, you can go and optimize your observability costs by ideally focusing on the data that is really valuable there.\n\nThat’s what we do across the whole platform, however we just added log management capabilities. As we added log management capabilities, we also wanted to bring this control value proposition around cost onto log data as well. That’s what Calyptia really does for us, for the Chronosphere platform there, is it allows you to have that same type of concept but for the log data type as well. Now our customers can see the cost of particular logs and also start to see the value of that as well. That is through this telemetry pipeline acquisition that we made in Calyptia.\n\nPaul Nashawaty: Yeah. Really, one other piece that you didn’t touch on a little bit, and I want to double click a little bit down on that, is the impacts to the ecosystem. Calyptia is also very broadly accepted in the open source community as well.\n\nMartin Mao: Yeah.\n\nPaul Nashawaty: That’s a big selling statement, especially for devops and devs and such, they want to make sure that there’s an open source project out there that’s been hardened, and tested and it works, but also with the Chronosphere backing of it, you have the enterprise level support that goes along with it. I probably didn’t want to steal your thunder there, but can you talk a little bit about that?\n\nMartin Mao: Yeah, 100%. The founders at Calyptia also created the Fluent Bit project, which is a graduated CNCF project and it could be used to ingest, enrich, process logs, metrics, traces and various telemetry types. That project has become super popular over the last couple of years. I think in the last two years, it went from one billion downloads to 13 billion downloads. This project is literally everywhere and it’s probably the thing that’s processing and routing your log data right now. For us, to your point, it was important for us to be able to continue to invest in open source community.\n\nChronosphere actually has an open core nature in itself, as well, so a lot of the technologies that we build on top of at Chronosphere are open source technologies that myself and my co-founder actually built originally at Uber as well. We’ve had this theme of open source and supporting the open source community from the very beginning, and I think Calyptia only continues that into the fluent side as well. We’re looking forward to continuing to support and I would say additionally support even further, the fluent community now as part of this acquisition.\n\nPaul Nashawaty: Martin, do you see this as, and I’m going to lead into it a little bit, but as a major differentiator in the market? The reason why I say that is because you see a lot of shifts that have been happening, a lot of acquisitions that are occurring, big, large vendors are being gobbled up and such. But there’s a very specific reason to go to Chronosphere over other solutions. Maybe you can just double click a little bit down on that, because I think that really, the audience should know that.\n\nMartin Mao: Yeah, 100%. For us, this acquisition, again, adds this concept of controlling your data and managing your costs through controlling that data. That for us is one of our major differentiators. We’ll talk about the other one in a second here, but that’s one of our major differentiators. Because the trend at which the observability data was growing, and hence directly correlated, the observability cost was growing, was an unsustainable trend. The cost of observability data and the volume of observability data increase over time is growing far faster than your overall cloud information footprint.\n\nIt was an unsustainable growth pattern. For us, solving that problem was key, in our mind, for the industry and that’s one of our major differentiators. Having Calyptia allowed us to do that for the log data type as well, and we’ve been doing it for metrics and for distributed traces this whole time, really does help us to continue to differentiate, at least on the cost side, for us there, but yeah.\n\nPaul Nashawaty: That makes sense, Martin. I think that customer choice, that’s what I’ve heard. I heard you customers can get to where they want to go to, they can leverage the platform for as much or as little, even if their journey doesn’t mean that they’re fully on that right side of the observability spectrum, they could be on the left side and just getting started, and they can still know and figure out how to get there. It’s definitely you have that customer choice to get them in the door, and try it, crawl, walk, run approach. But, Martin, as we’re wrapping this up, this last section, what’s next for Chronosphere? What do you see as the next advancements in the observability and the security space?\n\nMartin Mao: Yeah. On one hand for us, we’re going to continue down this cost control side of things for sure, and just really start to get more advanced there. But what’s more interesting is, and you mentioned this earlier, it’s all about actionable insights. I think the industry has been talking about a single pane of glass for a very long time. The problem with a single pane of glass is yes, you have all of your data in one place, but it’s all raw data. To what I said earlier about the volume increase in the amount of data there is, it’s almost too much for any developer to sift through.\n\nNow when something goes wrong, there’s so much data for somebody to process and figure out what’s going on, it’s actually quite hard and quite a difficult job to do. For us, the other differentiator of Chronosphere is that we actually automatically, through this feature called Chronosphere Lens which is our unique user experience, we actually automatically analyze all that raw data for you, and only present you the actionable insights. The whole thing is about actionable insights there. That’s really where both our investment is going to be going more and more into as we move forward, but also I think where the industry’s going a well.\n\nIf you look at the trend of more complex environments, more data, more signals I would say, one, you have to go deal with the cost of that, and two, you have to get more value out of that at a quicker pace. Those are really the two problems that we’re trying to solve here, and I think those are the two problems that the industry is running into, and hence that’s where we want to make our investments.\n\nPaul Nashawaty: Exciting. But for the audience here that’s watching this video right now, how would they get started with Chronosphere? Where do they go and what do they do? If they know nothing about this, how do they get going?\n\nMartin Mao: Yeah. Probably the best place is to go to chronosphere.io. We do our website there. We do have a lot of blog content, we do have a lot of webinars and things like that, that talks about I would say the problems that people on this call may be running into, and perhaps some of the ways that they can use Chronosphere to go help solve those particular problems.\n\nPaul Nashawaty: Very good, Martin. Martin, it’s always a pleasure talking to you. Thank you for your insights and your overview of Chronosphere, and this new acquisition as well as this partnership. It’s a very exciting time. I love the picture of Mount Rainier in the background, the Space Needle, it’s fantastic to see that. I also want to thank the audience for watching today.

      "# [The Combined Power of Chronosphere and Calyptia by Torsten Volk, Heather Joslyn, Randy Bias, Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols, Mary Branscombe, Raghavan \"Rags\" Srinivas, Ido Neeman, Todd R. Weiss, Rob Pankow, Will Stewart on 2024-02-06](https://thenewstack.io/the-combined-power-of-chronosphere-and-calyptia/)\nChronosphere’s acquisition of Calyptia is a shrewd strategic move that adds strong data pipeline management capabilities to Chronosphere’s cloud native observability platform. Both Chronosphere and Calyptia follow a federated management paradigm that includes a central SaaS-based control plane that remains out of stream, in combination with multiple data planes that can be located close to the customer’s application clusters.\n\nThis acquisition is impressive alone based on the fact that Chronosphere found a like-minded company focusing on the highest possible degree of scalability. Like Chronosphere, Calyptia is the result of a seasoned founder team seeking to figure out a solution to the rapid growth of cloud native infrastructure in terms of quantity, complexity, and constant change.\n\nThe Chronosphere observability platform resulted from the rich experience the founder team had made at Uber, while Calyptia launched in 2020 with the idea of providing commercial services around Fluentd and Fluent Bit, to open source data collector projects the company helped found. But not only do both companies follow very similar philosophies in their approach toward establishing cloud native observability, but Calyptia has the final puzzle piece Chronosphere needed to become a truly formidable contender in the cloud native observability space: a platform for data pipeline management.\n\nWhy Developers Should Care\n\nAfter the introduction of Lens, Chronosphere’s capability to automatically surface telemetry data relevant to any specific developer, the acquisition of Calyptia will allow Chronosphere to add more developer goodies to its platform. This radically developer-centric approach is so impressive as all of the traditional observability platforms have tried this same strategy without much success, creating space for Chronosphere in the market. The key strategic value propositions of this acquisition are:\n\nEnhancing Developer Productivity: Calyptia Core, built on the open source Fluent Bit data collection agent, is tailored to streamline developer workflows, thereby boosting productivity in observability tasks. Developers can simply connect telemetry data sources with transformation steps and export targets to optimize observability for their application via a drag-and-drop interface and without having to worry about complex agent management procedures.\n\nExamples:\n\nAutomated Log Aggregation: A developer working on a microservices architecture needs to aggregate logs from various services for debugging. Fluent Bit can be configured to automatically collect logs from all services and forward them to Calyptia Core. This eliminates the need for manual log collection, allowing the developer to focus on analyzing the aggregated logs to quickly identify and resolve issues.\n\nStreamlined Monitoring for Kubernetes: In a Kubernetes environment, a developer can use Fluent Bit as a DaemonSet to collect metrics and logs from each node. Calyptia Core can then process this data, applying filters and transformations before sending it to a monitoring solution like Prometheus or Grafana. This setup simplifies the monitoring pipeline and reduces the time spent on configuring and managing multiple monitoring agents.\n\nOptimizing Observability Costs: A key focus of Calyptia Core is to reduce the costs associated with observability. This is achieved through more efficient data management, which directly benefits Chronosphere’s clientele by simplifying telemetry data ingestion and management.\n\nExamples:\n\nReducing Data Ingestion Costs: Calyptia Core’s First Mile Observability strategy optimizes observability costs by focusing on efficient data management at the source. This approach reduces backend and egress costs, particularly beneficial for organizations dealing with IoT and edge applications spread across disparate public and private infrastructure. By filtering out noisy data before it is ingested into systems like Splunk, organizations can reduce costs and improve data quality, with some of Calyptia’s customers reporting substantial savings on their Splunk bills.\n\nAdditionally, by routing data to more cost-effective storage locations, organizations can significantly reduce the costs associated with data growth. This strategy enables organizations to gain immediate insights, improve data quality, and significantly reduce their observability costs.\n\nRouting Non-Essential Data to Cheaper Storage: Calyptia Core, powered by Fluent Bit, allows organizations to redirect non-essential data to cheaper storage. This can result in substantial savings, especially when using costly storage and analysis applications.\n\nBoosting Performance and Security: By leveraging Calyptia’s technologies, Chronosphere aims to enhance the performance of its observability platforms and fortify application security, addressing two critical concerns in modern computing environments.\n\nExamples:\n\nData Security: Calyptia Core provides features to identify sensitive data and redact, remove, or hash it midstream before it is stored. This capability can enhance the security of Chronosphere’s observability platforms by ensuring sensitive data is not unnecessarily exposed or stored.\n\nPerformance Measurement: Calyptia emphasizes the importance of effective performance measurement, which can help Chronosphere to establish performance benchmarks and goals, ensuring the quality of its application improves over time. By tracking metrics over time, teams can detect changes in behavior that may point to an underlying issue, thereby enhancing the performance of the observability platforms.\n\nAddressing Microservices Architecture Challenges: The growing trend toward microservices architecture, characterized by loosely coupled services owned by different teams and residing in varied cloud environments, poses unique challenges in observability, particularly in cost management and risk mitigation. The Chronosphere-Calyptia combination aims to offer solutions to these emerging challenges.\n\nExamples:\n\nEnhanced Observability: Microservices architecture can be complex and difficult to monitor due to the distributed nature of services. Chronosphere’s observability platform, enhanced by Calyptia’s log processing capabilities, can provide comprehensive visibility into the system. This allows for efficient troubleshooting and debugging, which are crucial in a microservices environment where services are loosely coupled and owned by different teams.\n\nCost Management: The cost of observability can be a significant challenge in a microservices environment due to the high volume of data generated. Calyptia’s platform can reduce the volume of data at the source using filters, making it more cost-effective to analyze. This can help Chronosphere manage the cost of observability in a microservices architecture.\n\nPipelines Simplified: Low Code/No-Code for Data Collection, Processing and Export\n\nCalyptia Core simplifies data pipeline construction and management in cloud native environments through a low-code/no-code approach. Its drag-and-drop interface allows developers to build data pipelines visually, reducing complexity and making it accessible to those with limited coding expertise. With over 100 integrations, Calyptia Core standardizes data collection across various applications and environments. It also offers built-in data processing transformations for data enrichment, aggregation, filtering, and reduction. Developers can test their pipelines in a sandbox environment before deployment, reducing risks.\n\nCalyptia leverages Fluent Bit’s pluggable architecture, eliminating the need for SDKs and APIs for custom integration code. Fluent Bit’s input, filter, and output plugins collect, process, and route data respectively. It also integrates well with Kubernetes and Prometheus, enriching logs with Kubernetes metadata and integrating with Prometheus Grafana dashboards.\n\nWebAssembly Integration\n\nThe Fluent Bit WebAssembly (WASM) plugin introduces a significant shift in data processing capabilities within observability frameworks, moving beyond traditional methods like Lua scripting or regular expressions. WASM allows developers to use comprehensive programming languages like C, Golang, and Rust for custom data processing tasks, compiled into a portable and efficient WASM binary for high performance and low overhead. This enables sophisticated log processing routines in complex cloud native environments, where logs can be filtered, enriched, and classified. For example, a routine could parse log entries, extract key information, and enrich the logs with additional context from an external API.\n\nThe WASM plugin can also leverage advanced technologies like large language models (LLMs) for tasks such as sentiment analysis, trend prediction, or anomaly detection. For instance, an LLM could categorize logs based on their urgency or potential impact on system performance, enabling a more focused and efficient observability strategy.\n\nAdditionally, the WASM plugin can facilitate sophisticated routing mechanisms, allowing log data to be routed to different destinations based on the analysis performed. In essence, the Fluent Bit WASM plugin enhances data observability and analysis capabilities in complex and dynamic cloud native environments by allowing the use of full-fledged programming languages and the integration of state-of-the-art AI models.\n\nSmall Footprint\n\nFluent Bit’s small footprint is a key feature for data collection efficiency in cloud native microservices architectures. Its implementation entirely in C results in a dramatically reduced memory footprint, operating with just around 1MB compared to FluentD’s 40MB and an average OpenTelemetry collector’s 50MB. This minimal resource usage is crucial in distributed environments with numerous microservices, where it leads to cost reductions and performance improvements.\n\nFluent Bit’s lean architecture allows for widespread deployment across application containers without significant resource consumption, especially important in Kubernetes environments. Additionally, the compiled C code enhances Fluent Bit’s data processing speed, essential for real-time observability and monitoring, making it a highly suitable solution for modern cloud native architectures.\n\nIn-Stream Processing\n\nFluent Bit’s in-stream processing, particularly through tail reading, enhances real-time data handling in cloud native environments by continuously monitoring and capturing changes in log files. This capability is beneficial in dynamic cloud native architectures, where the volume and velocity of data can be substantial.\n\nFluent Bit’s in-stream processing reduces latency and resource consumption, supports advanced operations such as applying new data schemata, parsing logs, and enriching data streams. For example, it can dynamically parse and structure log data, convert it from unstructured to structured formats, and enrich the data stream by applying tags or integrating additional metadata. This process is crucial for context-aware monitoring and analysis, providing deeper insight into the behavior and performance of applications and services.\n\nIn essence, Fluent Bit’s in-stream processing and tail reading capabilities enable efficient, real-time observability in cloud native environments, ensuring immediate data availability and facilitating advanced data manipulation.\n\nFluent Bit and OpenTelemetry: Better Together\n\nThe integration of Fluent Bit and OpenTelemetry offers a comprehensive data collection and analysis solution for modern observability, combining Fluent Bit’s efficiency with OpenTelemetry’s extensive instrumentation capabilities. Fluent Bit, with its lightweight footprint, can be deployed as a sidecar container in each pod of a Kubernetes cluster, using the OpenTelemetry input plugin to collect telemetry data directly from the application and infrastructure for real-time data collection and processing.\n\nFluent Bit can also collect logs and metrics from multiple microservices and send this data to observability tools like Jaeger and AWS X-Ray using the OpenTelemetry output plugin, enabling a unified view of distributed systems and aiding in tracing requests through microservices. Furthermore, Fluent Bit’s customizable nature allows for the collection of targeted telemetry data, which can be enriched, processed, and exported to OpenTelemetry-compatible backends for detailed analysis and visualization, providing bespoke insights into applications. In essence, the combination of Fluent Bit and OpenTelemetry provides a flexible, efficient, and comprehensive observability framework for diverse monitoring needs.\n\nConclusion: A New Era in Cloud Native Observability\n\nThe acquisition of Calyptia by Chronosphere marks a pivotal advancement in cloud native observability. This strategic alignment not only enhances Chronosphere’s observability platform but also signifies a commitment to scalability and developer-centric solutions. The integration of Calyptia’s efficient data management tools with Chronosphere’s existing capabilities paves the way for more intuitive, cost-effective, and performance-oriented observability in complex cloud native ecosystems.\n\nThis merger is particularly significant in its potential to streamline developer workflows and optimize data pipeline management, underpinned by the robust capabilities of Fluent Bit and OpenTelemetry. The future of observability in the cloud native domain looks promising, with this partnership poised to deliver more refined, intelligent, and adaptive solutions, addressing the intricate demands of modern application development and operations.\n\nIn short, Chronosphere’s acquisition of Calyptia is not just a merger of two companies but a fusion of shared visions and technological prowess, setting a new benchmark in the field of cloud native observability.",
      "# [Welcome Calyptia to Chronosphere by Martin Mao, Amanda Mitchell on 2024-01-22](https://chronosphere.io/learn/calyptia-acquisition-announcement/)\nChronosphere has been helping customers tackle Observability challenges in their cloud native environments since we opened our doors for business four and a half years ago. When we launched Chronosphere, my co-founder Rob Skillington and I were fresh off building and operating the Observability platform for one of the largest cloud native environments in the world at Uber. We saw first hand the problems and pressures that this new architecture places on Observability tooling and we have been solving these problems with innovative solutions since then.\n\nOne of these solutions we’re well known for is helping customers control Observability data growth, which is outpacing infrastructure footprint growth by 2-3x. We started off by helping companies deal with high cardinality Metrics. Next, we helped companies control their distributed tracing volumes with dynamic sampling techniques. We were even the first Observability vendor to join the FinOps foundation and built the Observability Data Optimization Cycle. And most recently, the Chronosphere Observability platform added the ability to store and query Logs with Logs powered by CrowdStrike, which meant we needed to solve the data growth challenge for Logs as well.\n\nAll telemetry data is growing at an incredible rate, but Logs are a special kind of beast due to the immense verbosity of Log data. Take these astounding findings from Gartner: Enterprises are producing higher than 10TBs per day of Logging data, with an increasing number observed in the 100TB range. That’s per day!\n\nThere are also dynamics with Logs that don’t exist for Metrics or Traces. For one, there is no industry standard Logging format or protocol like Prometheus for Metrics and OpenTelemetry for Traces. This makes controlling Log data growth a much harder problem as the solution needs to work across multiple protocols, coming from multiple sources. Unlike Metrics or Traces, there are also many different use cases for Logs — like security, audit, or Observability — and these use cases are solved with different tools. This means a company’s Log data is rarely stored in a single location.\n\nThese Log data growth and translation complexity challenges are exactly what the open source Fluent projects — created by the founders of Calyptia, Eduardo Silva and Anurag Gupta — are designed to solve. Fluent Bit can ingest telemetry data from multiple sources, in multiple formats, and route that data to multiple different Logging backends — seamlessly translating that data along the way. Calyptia, the leader in Observability pipelines, offers a product built on Fluent Bit that enables turnkey Log collection, aggregation, and transformation — ultimately allowing companies control of their Log data.\n\nThe positives in teaming with Calyptia go way beyond technology — we are a natural fit. For starters, Chronosphere and Calyptia are long-time friends. To see that friendship in action, look no further than Chronosphere’s first ever company blog published in May 2021, which recaps my fireside chat with Anurag at FluentCon.\n\nWe also have similar origin stories — we were both co-founded by two long-time colleagues and friends; we are both remote-first; and the success of both startups took hold during the pandemic when everything was happening online and cloud native adoption took off.\n\nThe cultural values of the two companies are well aligned and then there’s the talent — team members from both startups are brimming with grit and can-do attitudes. Chronosphere’s talented team has always been a source of pride for me and I’m excited that we’ll be gaining more of the same from the Calyptia team.\n\nEach May I write my annual birthday blog to mark a new anniversary and to reflect back on what we’ve accomplished over the past year — and we’ve had some really huge milestones to celebrate such as our rounds of funding that total $343 million to date and which established us as a unicorn at only two years old.\n\nDare I say past milestones, grand as they are, almost pale in comparison to the acquisition of Calyptia and offering the complete data growth control capabilities in our Observability platform. In a flash, we’re now able to continue solving our customers’ most pressing challenge across the Log data type. And we’re doing this with an even larger team of Chronaut superstars who are distributed around the globe from the US to the UK to my beloved home country, Australia. My “Happy Fifth Birthday Chronosphere” blog is still a few months away, but I have an idea of what will be top of mind when I sit down to write it.\n\nWelcome to the team, Calyptia!",

      "# [Chronosphere Tackles Log Data Management Costs & Complexity with Launch of Telemetry Pipeline and Observability Log Controls on 2024-06-07](https://chronosphere.io/news/chronosphere-tackles-log-data-management-costs-amp-complexity/)\nJune 10, 2024; Portland, OR, MONITORAMA:\n\nThe top log data challenge facing organizations today is getting useful insights from exploding log data volumes that are expected to grow by more than 250% in the next year¹. Chronosphere, the observability platform built for control, today announced new log data control capabilities that reduce log data volumes and costs by up to 30%, while streamlining log data processing. Six months after the acquisition of Calyptia, Chronopshere is relaunching the Fluent Bit-based solution as Telemetry Pipeline. In addition, the company is adding greater control of log data volumes and routing as part of the logging solution in its Observability Platform.\n\nChronosphere Telemetry Pipeline is 20x more resource efficient than the top competitor, according to a side-by-side comparison². Customers save money by transforming and reducing log data before it’s routed and stored. Continuing with Calyptia’s commitment to open standards and connections, customers can route data from any source to any observability, object storage, log streams, or SIEM (Security information and event management) back end. The Kubernetes-native solution also simplifies the management of log pipelines with out of box automation capabilities, such as automatic load balancing, automatic healing, and one-click scaling.\n\n“Engaging with Chronosphere Telemetry Pipeline (formerly known as Calyptia) enabled us to significantly reduce our complexity and project timelines. This allowed us to onboard more data sources, compare multiple SIEM backends, and reduce complexity as we performed transformations and reductions,“ said Michael Shubaly, Senior Security Operations Specialist at BlackBerry LTD, a leading cybersecurity company that helps organizations secure the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\nLog data management is already a part of Chronosphere’s highly-scalable and comprehensive Observability Platform, which also manages Metrics, Traces, and Events. With this launch, Logs are now fully integrated into the Observability Control Plane, which allows customers to transform data into its most useful form while removing less valuable data. Plus, customers can now transform log data in flight, before routing to either Chronosphere or a cloud object store. The net effect reduces data volumes and optimizes costs since customers only pay for the data they keep.\n\n“With the rapid growth of log data, organizations are struggling to balance observability and security needs with the pressure to cut costs and reduce the sheer volume,” said Chronosphere Global Head of Product and Design Jeff Cobb. “This is what we are focused on with Chronosphere Telemetry Pipeline and the new Logs control capabilities, which automatically transform, enhance, and route logs in an efficient and affordable way.”\n\nTo learn more about the Chronosphere Observability Platform and Chronosphere Telemetry Pipelines:",
      "# [Team Archives](https://chronosphere.io/chronaut-culture/team/)\nI joined Chronosphere as an Engineering Manager in January after spending the past five and a half years at Palantir, where I led the observability team. My team was responsible for building and maintaining the infrastructure which enabled our engineers to observe and monitor their systems, debug issues as they occurred, and resolve problems in a timely manner. Our production fleet consisted of hundreds of thousands of pods running at any given point in time. Anybody who’s worked with distributed systems at this scale understands the criticality of good observability tooling: without highly available and reliable monitoring systems, you and the business are flying blind.\n\nChronosphere first appeared on my radar through this previous role, where one of the largest ongoing pain points for my team was managing the metrics usage of other engineering teams in the organization. It was all too easy for a developer to add a line of code which inadvertently blew up their metrics cardinality, and along with it, our observability bill.\n\nWhen I first joined the observability team at Palantir, we relied on in-house tooling built on top of our own data platform to monitor metrics usage on a per-team basis. While partially automated, it still required human intervention to resolve the issues that inevitably surfaced. This solution required an ongoing and active energy investment and failed to effectively “put the pebble in the shoe” of the teams instrumenting their services in an inefficient manner, where the value derived from the metrics was not proportionate with the cost.\n\nMy team built tooling that programmatically dropped low-value metrics, but I was intrigued by the opportunity to build generalized versions of such solutions at Chronosphere. I had a deep understanding of the frustrations experienced as a member of the central observability team. Chronosphere offered capabilities to manage metrics usage out of the box that I’d wished I had on my own team. This stood out to me as a game-changer in a highly competitive observability landscape, and I was convinced that their product would all but sell itself.\n\nConviction in the product seeded my initial interest, and the opportunity to participate in solving organizational problems at a quickly-growing early stage startup sealed the deal. My previous company had over 3,000 employees when I left. Chronosphere had closer to 100 people when I joined this past January and we’ve since doubled in size.\n\nWhile at Palantir, I had an amazing mentor who taught me the characteristics of an effective Engineering Manager over the course of several years. I was frequently outside of my comfort zone and it was a trial by fire at times, but my mentor gave me the tools and coaching I needed to solve hard engineering and leadership problems. The lessons that stuck with me the most were those which were learned through painful failures. However, the growth I experienced during these periods of discomfort was unparalleled. Toward the end of my tenure at the company, the periods of discomfort waned and my own growth tapered. I knew it was time for me to find a place where I could both continue to grow independently and also pass along the lessons and skills that I had learned.\n\nSince starting at Chronosphere, I’ve ramped up on three engineering teams and had an opportunity to apply the same lessons about building well-oiled software development machines in different contexts on a far more condensed timeline. I’ve been exposed to new problems, such as how to foster collaborative relationships between engineering and the field, and how to construct an effective hiring pipeline. However, the most unique set of challenges have come from remote work.\n\nThis was the first time that I joined a company remotely and it presented a unique set of additional challenges. I didn’t fully appreciate how much harder it is to ramp up and feel connected to the broader company in a remote-first environment. You lose out on all of the organic interactions which occur in the office and there isn’t a well-established playbook for how to bridge this gap, particularly at scale. In response to these new challenges, we’re experimenting with creative ways to build a strong culture in our distributed workforce, with efforts ranging from the highly local, such as supporting grassroots team clusters that we see forming in local coworking spaces, to global, such as holding company-wide events in virtual reality. This is at the cutting edge of how we work, and we get to pave the path at Chronosphere. The camaraderie is real.\n\nThe past nine months have gone by in a blur. At the same time, it feels like far more has happened than what deserves to reasonably fit within this timeframe, in the best way possible. I can’t wait to see what the future has in store.\n\nIf any of this resonates with you, there might be a place for you at Chronosphere. Reach out and let’s chat.\n\nIn this Meet the Team profile, we chat with Luke Tillman, located in Denver, Colorado, on what it’s like to be a front-end engineer on the platform team. Luke, who is well-versed in open-sourcing, joined Chronosphere and was actually one of the first hires on the UI team. Catch up on the whole chat with Chris Ward. Below are a few highlights.\n\nWhat do you do at Chronosphere?\n\nI’m a front-end engineer – a UI engineer – on the platform team. So, I work on our cloud product, but on the front end. We have a handful of other folks that also do UI work – they aren’t full-time front-end or UI engineers, but most of the UI folks work on the platform on the cloud.\n\nWhat were some of the reasons you decided to come to Chronosphere?\n\nI was one of the first two UI engineers hired. There were two things. When I started looking at Chronosphere, one aspect that jumped out at me immediately was the chance to work with cool distributed systems tech again. I have a little bit of background there. When I was looking at M3, our open source database that the tech is built around, it reminded me a lot of Cassandra – which is something that I worked with at a previous company.\n\nThe biggest reason that I ended up joining was the people. When I interviewed, everybody was just super kind and empathetic and it was really obvious even in the interview process. It gave me a chance to work with Sterling – the head of our UX who I adore, and we worked together at a previous company. The people are really what drew me and what keeps me around even a year and a half later.\n\nWhat did you do before coming to Chronosphere?\n\nI’ve been in tech for about twenty years now. I guess that dates me. I started out more full-stack, and spent a bunch of time in the . NET space. I wrote a lot of C# in my early days.\n\nI kind of burned out on tech in my twenties, and three years in my late twenties I just quit tech completely. I was a bartender for three years which was actually a lot of fun.\n\nMost recently, I was at a company called DataStax, where I worked on all things Apache Cassandra-related. That was fun.\n\nI also joined DevRel. I was a developer advocate for the first three years. It was something I had never done before. I got to go around and travel, give talks, and teach which I really enjoyed. I eventually went back to engineering full-time.\n\nWhat is the most interesting technical challenge that Chronosphere is solving?\n\nIt has to do with the scale of data that our customers are working with. Working with distributed databases, there’s a certain set of challenges that you don’t have unless you’re working at a bigger scale that some of these technologies solve. When you’re dealing with a huge scale of data, we think about things like: “How do you present a huge volume of data in a meaningful way?” It gets more challenging when you’re dealing with a scale that some of our customers have – or even making sure that things in the front-end perform. And that’s something you don’t get to do at every job.\n\nWhat are you working on right now that you’re most excited about?\n\nI’m on a new dashboard work stream that has been rolling for a little while. I’m doing most of my work right now in an open source project called Perses – where we’re building a dashboarding solution. It’s a lot of fun, and an opportunity to work in open source again. I’m having a good time building dashboarding from scratch.\n\nWhat’s a fun fact about you that nobody would guess?\n\nA friend of mine from grade school moved out here to Denver before I did and really got into the craft brewing scene and wanted to open his own brewery. I got the chance to invest a teeny tiny bit of money, so I own a little bit of a craft brewery here in Denver – called Downhill Brewing.\n\nWhat cool new tool are you trying out that you want to tell everyone about?\n\nThere is this project called Cue Lang. It’s a really interesting way of defining contracts for things – like our configuration of APIs. You can define structures, and get all sorts of validation and code generations for free. It’s a cool little piece of technology that I’ve been playing around with recently.\n\nIf you were an animal, what would you be?\n\nI would be a dog. My wife and I have two and I adore them. I think I would live my best life eating, sleeping and playing. We have two lhasa apsos that have Ewok faces.\n\nWho is someone you’ve considered a role model in your life or career?\n\nI’d say my parents played a huge role at different points and for different reasons. Early on, my Mom is the one who really instilled my work ethic and a love for learning that I still have to this day. She got me reading at a really young age – fiction and things like that. That’s something that I still do every day, before I go to bed.\n\nLater on in life, my dad played a huge role. My Dad’s been a software engineer for about forty years now. He works for Pivotal, in open source projects. He’s been a wealth of knowledge and really helpful at talking through things with me. Tech is a family business for us. My other two brothers have done coding boot camps.\n\nWhat is a quote that you reflect on that motivates you?\n\nI asked my wife this last night. I don’t really have a quote. If I had a quote, it would probably be from a movie. It would have to be “Runaway!!!” from Monty Python, the Holy Grail.\n\nListen in to hear Chris and Luke’s entire conversation:\n\nMore blogs in the Meet the Team series\n\nMeet the Chronosphere team: Mary Fesenko, software engineer\n\nMeet the Chronosphere team: Shreyas Srivatsan, Member of Technical Staff\n\nMeet the Team: Alec Holmes, Member of Technical Staff\n\nMeet the Chronosphere Team: Elenore Bastian, Engineering Manager\n\nMeet the Chronosphere Team: Audrey Bastian, UX Designer\n\nMeet the Chronosphere Team: Ting Chen, Member of Technical Staff\n\nMeet the Chronosphere Team: Brandon Bright, Account Executive\n\nIn today’s Meet the Chronosphere Team profile, we get to know Alex Miljanić, a Senior Sales Development Representative (SDR) who works out of Chronosphere’s New York office. In her role as an SDR, Alex is the first line of contact for many of Chronosphere’s new customers. In this interview with Chris Ward, Alex indulges us with her day-to-day life as a Sales Rep in the observability space, why she joined Chronosphere, and she talks fondly about her brief stint as an English teacher abroad.\n\nWhat do you do at Chronosphere?\n\nAs a Senior Sales Development Representative (SDR) my day-to-day job includes sourcing, tiering new accounts, identifying champions and main point of contacts – I do a lot of the original engagements when we’re trying to break in and identify a good use case fit for our observability platform.\n\nIs this about developing relationships?\n\nYes, I’m the first line of contact for many of the relationships we have/will have with incoming customers. My team will tier out accounts, collect information on their tools and challenges, and plan a strategy for use case tie-ins so we can have introductory conversations and make sure our relationship would be mutually beneficial.\n\nWhat were some of the reasons that you decided to come to Chronosphere?\n\nI came from a competitor. That was my first experience in sales. I really enjoyed observability and open source projects – and how those projects worked from the perspective of the engineers. I always wanted to stay in tech, but I found that my niche was in observability. Understanding how Chronosphere works, how scalable it is, how novel some of our control plane abilities are alongside the aggregation rights – ultimately, it was a decision about how advanced the technology is within the current day market, that’s what drew me in.\n\nWhat did you do before coming to Chronosphere?\n\nI worked in sales at another tech company and I wanted to stay within that space because I found that when you’re talking to engineers, observability is something always being prioritized or on the roadmap for future prioritizations – it’s a stabilizing front for teams understanding how their systems are behaving. If I’m talking to people in big banks, or talking to startups that are just getting their products off the ground – everybody is moving towards microservices, which are complex in nature and especially at scale. To handle microservices architectures, teams need to employ a seamless integration with reliable monitoring tools to track their metrics.\n\nObservability sounds like a buzzword, but whenever I speak to engineers, it doesn’t matter if I’m talking to a VP of engineering or an SRE – when you say observability, describe Chronosphere with one or two sentences, it resonates with everybody. Whether or not it’s a current challenge that the company is facing is another story. But when you bring up the product, it’s something that everybody’s familiar with as being something of critical value\n\nWhat is the most interesting technical challenge that Chronosphere is solving?\n\nThe scalability of microservices and resolving their associated pains. What I’m referring to can present itself in the form of outages and cardinality spikes in the same systems SRE and DevOps teams are actively managing. Chronosphere is particularly positioned in the market to handle these things.\n\nWe have the transparency and the visibility into your data which, now with these microservices becoming popularized and a de facto standard in the market – you’re noticing when you’re having these conversations with engineers, that they are all starting to see issues with the scale. They’re starting to understand that open source projects may not be able to handle the massive volume that they’re managing. So, they either have to hire a ton of engineers to build homegrown systems that can scale better – which costs a lot of money, or defer to SaaS vendors.\n\nSo, the answer to your question is scalability, through and through, which Martin talks about in his blogs and podcasts and Rob writes about in blogs as well.\n\nWhat are you working on right now that you’re excited about?\n\nAt the moment, the team is working around strategically reframing not only what kinds of customers/teams we’re actively targeting, but also planning for the changing secondary and tertiary questions that they’re asking us given their wider experience in resolving the variable issues with their observability stack. OS technologies are fantastic – they’re amongst the most exciting pieces of the tech space for me. Engineers love them, and they love to adopt and configure them. The intersection point is creating a managed system that avoids vendor lock-in by being compatible with Graphite and Prometheus to maintain comfort/familiarity, but can successfully scale and store those metric stacks and reduce management overhead.\n\nWhat’s a fun fact about you that nobody would guess?\n\nThis is actually on my LinkedIn. I worked at a Czech University in Prague as an English teacher for a year with students that were ages 16 to 28. I was 23, but I think they all imagined me as being older just because I was making the decisions in the classroom. A lot of incredibly intelligent exchange students who all had an impressive level of grit leaving their families to live in a different country.\n\nIf you were an animal, what would you be?\n\nI’ll say what other people call me – a llama. I have a friend at Chronosphere that always calls me a llama. I’m a little goofy and I have a really long neck.\n\nWho is someone that you consider a role model and how have they helped guide you in your life or career?\n\nMy Dad got a PhD in computer science from Rutgers University. That’s why both of my parents relocated from Serbia to America. Then war broke out over there and they ended up staying in America. I would say my Dad influenced me both from an academic and professional standpoint. He’s just incredibly hard working, so I’ve had those ideas instilled in me from a very young age. Growing up, becoming an adult – I’ve realized having parents who aren’t just solid parents but are also good people is a real gift. My dad always used to say that when you start speaking too loudly in a discussion, your content becomes less and less relevant. That’s a pretty important point in life; I think you should always be clear. If you operate with distracting behaviors, people will get distracted.\n\nWhat’s a quote you reflect on, you mention to people a lot, or that motivates you?\n\nIt’s kind of corny, but it’s one of Chronosphere’s pillars: “Win together, lose together.” When you’re a part of a cohort, everybody shares the same objective and the responsibility when things are going badly and when things are going well. You just have to stay aligned and share the emotional ups and downs that happen. I think in sales, they happen rather frequently.\n\nListen in to hear Alex and Chris’ entire conversation here:\n\nIn this Meet the Chronosphere Team profile, we chat with Brandon Bright, located in Atlanta, Georgia and who started 2 years ago as the first member of the Chronosphere sales team. Brandon runs us through his day-to-day life as an Account Executive and also shares what inspired him to join the team, how he educates customers about outgrowing open source, why the technical sale is his jam, and the excitement of being a new Dad.\n\nWhat do you do at Chronosphere?\n\nI partner with potential customers on observability and strategy – as well as which customers would be good for Chronosphere and vice versa. I support them through pilot and production. I also spend a lot of time supporting onboarding for new sales team members.\n\nWhat were some of the reasons that you decided to join Chronosphere?\n\nI would categorize the reasons why I joined in four different buckets. The first bucket is the founders. I spent ten-plus hours with (co-founder and CEO) Martin Mao, which was very rare in the interview process. With Martin, I spent time understanding the company vision and talking about what the sales team would look like; the technology; and Uber and M3 (Prior to co-founding Chronosphere, Martin led the observability team at Uber where he and Chronosphere co-founder and CTO, Rob Skillington, created the Prometheus-compatible open source metrics engine, M3).\n\nMartin spent a ton of time with me – I think he was partially evaluating me and also how I would strategically think about the organization. That was huge for me – just knowing that I’m going to a company where the founders are specifically motivated to find and build the right sales team. (Read the backstory about how Chronosphere came to be.)\n\nThe second bucket was the tech. It was obvious that there was a technical advantage with the M3 and Uber story. I didn’t come from (an observability) background, so I had to do a lot of research on it. But from what I found, and from speaking to Martin, Rob, and other people, there’s definitely an advantage to having leaders with their track record in observability.\n\nThe third thing that I always look for in a job is the type of customer that we sell to. I’m big on selling to technical customers. I like the highly technical sale and large-scale problems, so those are things that motivated me to join Chronosphere.\n\nThe fourth bucket was just the market in general – evaluating how much companies spend on observability. Also the fact it’s a business-critical tool and it’s something that everybody needs. So, I think those are the four reasons that made me want to join Chronosphere. (Chronosphere head of sales, Ron DeCanio, talks more about the observability market opportunity here.)\n\nWhat did you do before coming to Chronosphere?\n\nI went to school for Engineering but my first job out of college was tech sales at (semiconductor vendor) Texas Instruments. Two other people and I decided to leave TI and start our own business. We built two mobile applications and a web application for really large events. The goal was to use mesh networks to allow people to connect without service. It gave me the groundwork to do a lot of research on tech and that was helpful in understanding software.\n\nWhat is the most interesting technical challenge that you think Chronosphere is solving?\n\nProviding observability to large scale cloud-native companies is a huge challenge. A lot of the companies that we speak to, especially the big tech companies, only have two options: build it yourself with open source, or use Chronosphere. The other tools that we’ve seen in the market just don’t provide the reliability or availability on top of being cost efficient. After doing a TCO (total cost of ownership) exercise, these organizations see Chronosphere as the only SaaS offering that’s anywhere close to providing the value they need versus the investment being made. That speaks to the differentiators of M3, and the differentiation that [Chronosphere] has built on top of it in our SaaS offering.\n\nOrganizations often underestimate the hidden costs of open source. How do you educate customers about this challenge?\n\nThere is a lot to learn about:\n\nThe cost of building the same functionality you get with Chronosphere.\n\nThe cost of getting to a baseline with the tools you’re using that are open source.\n\nThe cost of training the team and being able to constantly have enough resources.\n\nWe try to help explain all the potential challenges that exist with using open source for your new observability requirements.\n\nWhat are you working on right now that you’re excited about?\n\nMore of a personal response, but my wife and I have been preparing for our first baby girl. A lot of my mental capacity has been preparing for that.\n\nAt work, I am building a training enablement program. With the recent funding and growth on the sales team, we’re hiring a ton of AEs (account executives), SDRs (sales development reps), SEs (sales engineers), and other sales team members. There’s a lot of work that goes into making sure new sales hires are prepared to be successful.\n\nWhat’s a fun fact about you that nobody would guess?\n\nI have never actually read a full book. I’ve tried multiple times. Didn’t do it in college. Didn’t do it in high school. Always found my way around it. Still don’t do it today. I’m usually listening to podcasts or I’ll read an article, but a full book – I just don’t have the capacity to do that.\n\nIf you were an animal, what would you be?\n\nI would be a bird. I have this recurring dream at least once a week where I can fly. I don’t know if I was a bird in a past life – I don’t have a specific one in mind, but that would have to be it.\n\nWho is someone that you consider a role model that has helped guide you in your life and career generally?\n\nMy Dad. He’s in sales as well. He was always around and made time for the family. He has a massive personality and always showed love for family and friends. Definitely the person that I strive to be.\n\nWhat is a quote that motivates you?\n\nI heard one recently from Eliza – a new team member on the recruiting team who said this in the interview process: “I chose this career because it gives me energy – rather than a career that takes energy away.” I’ve reflected on this a lot in my job, and while recruiting other people: figuring out what gives people energy, and what makes them excited.\n\nMore blogs in the Meet the Team series\n\nMeet the Chronosphere team: Mary Fesenko, software engineer\n\nMeet the Chronosphere team: Shreyas Srivatsan, Member of Technical Staff\n\nMeet the Team: Alec Holmes, Member of Technical Staff\n\nMeet the Chronosphere Team: Elenore Bastian, Engineering Manager\n\nMeet the Chronosphere Team: Audrey Bastian, UX Designer\n\nMeet the Chronosphere Team: Ting Chen, Member of Technical Staff\n\nIn today’s Meet the Chronosphere Team profile, we get to know Nate Broyles, one of Chronosphere’s software engineers on the control team and a member of our growing East Coast offices in New York (also our largest location!) In this interview with Chris Ward, Nate delights us with a discussion about his love for sloths and weekend roller-skating, the most interesting technical challenges that Chronosphere is solving today, and what led to him joining Chronosphere over a year ago.\n\nWhat do you do at Chronosphere?\n\nI am a software engineer, part of the technical staff on the control team. We are one of the teams responsible for the ownership of M3 – the core database that powers a lot of what we do here. We specifically focus on ensuring that we have the ability to control users’ access to data and resources. We are able to throw them in without causing any issues for the underlying data source itself. We also educate them on ways to better execute queries or writes so that they get on the golden path.\n\nWhat were some of the reasons that you decided to join Chronosphere?\n\nI had the opportunity to work with Matt Mihic [Chronosphere Head of Engineering] before. I really enjoyed working with him and got to trust his engineering acumen. Having been places before where metrics observability was a huge problem and we had to go through a few different vendors, I knew that what Chronosphere was attempting to solve was a big problem for people and it had a real opportunity. Then, I got to learn the backstory about how Chronoshere came to be. I had the opportunity to meet the co-founders Martin (CEO) and Rob (CTO) and I knew this is what I wanted to do.​​ I didn’t plan on joining a Series B startup, but having all of those factors outlined in front of me made me feel much more comfortable knowing this is a place that is solving a real problem and has the right people in place (Read Martin Mao’s blog about Chronosphere’s recent $200 Series C funding round and how the has achieved unicorn status here.)\n\nWhat did you do before coming to Chronosphere?\n\nI was at Square before. I was there for about 6 ½ years. I learned a ton there – I think it was probably one of the most rewarding jobs I had because it really helped me mature and become a much better engineer. I met some super talented folks, some of whom I am really fortunate enough to work with today. I’m really grateful for that. Matt was my old boss – we were working on CashApp, which is a part of Square.\n\nWhat is the most interesting technical challenge that you think Chronosphere is solving?\n\nI think it’s just the sheer magnitude of data that is coming into the system. Our whole value proposition is, “You can send a ton of data to us, no problem.” We’ll store it and we’ll serve you back, use nice graphs – whatever you want, In whatever kind of timescale you want, in a response time that you’ll find acceptable. That’s very easy to state, but very difficult to actually do. There’s a lot of work that has to go on behind the scenes from the data store itself, being able to just simply handle that volume and that amount of data, all the way up to the front end – being able to properly present that much data. It affects every aspect of what we do here at Chronosphere. The biggest technical challenge is simply what we’ve set out to actually solve – which is handling the sheer amount of volume that our customers send to us.\n\nWhat are you working on right now that you’re really excited about?\n\nWhat I’m currently focusing on right now is getting an integration test framework in place that can spin up the components of M3 and have them be able to talk to each other. We have unit tests in place and what we call “scenario tests” for long running operations, like adding a namespace. But, we don’t really have good integration tests that allow us to do inter-component communications. Like having an aggregator, a DB node, a coordinator spun up – and having them all talk to each other.\n\nWe actually have two iterations of this, but they require Docker containers to be spun up. And then those Docker containers talk to each other – and that’s fine, that works for correctness. But, it really is difficult when you’re trying to iterate and make changes very quickly. You have to rebuild your image and spin up a new Docker container. And then it makes debuggability difficult because you have to attach a remote debugger to a Docker container and that has to be built in a specific way to allow that. But it would be convenient if you could just go to your IDE and you just click run the same way you run a unit test and say: “Hey, I want a new DB node. I want a new aggregator, a new coordinator.” And they all come up and know how to talk to each other – and you can start issuing commands via the public API. That’s what I’m working on tackling right now. And this is really born out of the frustration that several engineers on the M3 team had as we were building out these previous features. I know when people talk about tests, eyes kind of glaze over, but I’m actually really excited about this.\n\nWhat’s a fun fact about you that nobody would guess?\n\nI love roller skating. I grew up next to a skating rink – so I’m actually decent. Fairly often I’ll go to the park and roller skate. I really enjoy it, and it’s having a revival right now. It feels a bit like a vindication because for a long time people thought it was like a dinosaur. But we’re back, so it feels good to be on trend again.\n\nIf you were an animal, what would you be?\n\nI’ve known this answer for a while. The three-toed sloth is one of my favorite animals. It’s just super lazy, and comes down once a week to do its business. Otherwise, it’s just hanging out in the trees and has this little goofy smile on its face all the time. And that’s just the kind of energy that I want to project: taking it easy, having a good time. I’m trying to mosey my way through life. That would be me.\n\nWho is someone that you consider a role model that has helped guide you in your life and career generally?\n\nMy parents. I think the world of them and they really provided a good example of work ethic and moral compass. And just how to try and be the best person you can be. I think my parents really gave me a solid footing. The older I get, the more I realize that not everyone gets that – and I just become more and more appreciative. I’m really, really grateful for what they’ve done and just being there for me and actually giving me the love I think anyone needs as they grow up from a child to an adult.\n\nProfessionally, I’ve just been fortunate to have people in the right place at the right time. I never had a mentor in the traditional sense where it’s the person that I check in with every so often, but I’ve been fortunate enough to meet people…and bounce ideas off of each other and it ends up helping me in the right direction. I don’t think I’ve taken the most direct path to where I am today. So there’s definitely been some missteps. But I do think that generally along the way, I’ve been able to gather really, really good advice that ultimately helped me get into a position that I’m pretty happy with.\n\nWhat’s a quote you reflect on, you mention to people a lot, or that motivates you??\n\nI actually don’t know where it came from, but it’s something that I started saying maybe five or six years ago and now some of my friends know that I say it. It’s never too late to be the person that you want to be. I try to use that to try new things or be a better person the next day, if I feel like I wasn’t great today. I like the idea behind it, where, no matter how old you are, or where you are in life, you can always use the next day to try and do better than the last. I kind of appreciate that.\n\nListen in to hear Chris and Nate’s entire conversation:\n\nMore blogs in the Meet the Team series\n\nMeet the Chronosphere team: Mary Fesenko, software engineer\n\nMeet the Chronosphere team: Shreyas Srivatsan, Member of Technical Staff\n\nMeet the Team: Alec Holmes, Member of Technical Staff\n\nMeet the Chronosphere Team: Elenore Bastian, Engineering Manager\n\nMeet the Chronosphere Team: Audrey Bastian, UX Designer\n\nMeet the Chronosphere Team: Ting Chen, Member of Technical Staff\n\nWhat do you get when you cross a former science teacher with an eternally happy person who loves a hard technical challenge? Meet Audrey. In today’s Meet the Chronosphere Team profile, we get to know Audrey Bastian, a UX designer who is helping Chronosphere give our customers – huge and not-as-huge alike – an excellent observability-team experience. Audrey has been with Chronosphere since March this year. In her interview below with Chris Ward, she talks about why she joined Chronosphere, exciting things she’s working on, what it’s like to be 5’3” and win an all-city fitness challenge, and more.\n\nWhat do you do at Chronosphere?\n\nI’m a UX designer – one of two currently, but our team is growing rapidly. That means I’m designing the product to make it as usable as possible for everyone, whether you are a team member, a manager, or an executive.\n\nWhat were some of the reasons you decided to come to Chronosphere?\n\nMy past experience was mostly working on stuff that wasn’t as technically challenging. When I was looking for my next role, I was looking for something that was super technical and kind of hard. Stuff that’s challenging just makes the day go faster, and I’m constantly – like every day – learning something new here, and it’s really fun to make those connections. I get so much pride and joy when I realize, “This connects to this” and I’m able to piece it all together. That’s a lot of fun. And then also my sister works here! Elenore is the engineering manager, and I feel like we’ve both been in tech for so long, and always thought it would be cool if we worked at the same company. So this has been a really great opportunity and a lot of fun for us … the Chrono-sisters, that’s what we call ourselves. {We recently did a Meet the Team profile on Audrey’s sister, Elenore Bastian, which you can read here.}\n\nWhat did you do before coming to Chronosphere?\n\nI’ve had a couple of different positions. The one most recently was working in media. I was designing how someone might program different TV shows to go on the air. It was cool. I worked in healthcare for a little bit, designing different products for health applications. I also worked at Microsoft. Prior to all of that, I taught eighth grade science on the South Side of Chicago. I made a big career switch.\n\nWhat is the most interesting technical challenge Chronosphere is solving?\n\nThe most interesting technical challenge I face is: How do you scale a product to fit so many different companies? We have customers that are massive, and have thousands of employees, and some that are much smaller. How do you create a product that’s intuitive for all of these different users? And make sure everyone understands all the things that the product does? And make sure they are all able to turn on the features that they need, or ignore the features that they don’t? How do we make a product that works for all groups? That’s definitely been a big challenge.\n\nWhat are you working on right now that you’re excited about?\n\nI’m part of the new Info Model team. It’s very small right now – there are just a couple of us. The Info Model team is essentially restructuring the product to better match users’ environments. Our users tend to think of themselves as teams, so how do we make our product more team-friendly? When you log into the product, how do you only see the things that are pertinent to you? That’s the new challenge I’m tackling. It’s very much like architecture, where you’re figuring out where everything fits in and how permissions work. We’re still very much in the early stages, and narrowing down exactly how we want it to look and feel, and what pieces need to be included.\n\nBefore the Info Model team, I was on the Foundations team and was working on a project that leads into this – users and teams, which is how users access the system, how do you set up a team, and now we’re getting into, what the team sees once it’s set up.\n\nWhat’s a fun fact about you that nobody would guess?\n\nI think I’m oddly strong for how small I am. I’m not very tall, but I recently won an all-city fitness competition, which I’m very proud of. Another fun fact is I’ve gotten to wear the Clippy suit. It’s in the Microsoft archives and I got to wear it once.\n\nWhat stickers are on your laptop?\n\nI actually don’t have any. I used to when I was a teacher. I was obsessed with stickers, and I had them all over my water bottle. One time my student dropped my water bottle and it bent in a way that I couldn’t use it anymore. I was devastated because I had taken so much time to collect and stick each one in a nice way. So now I can’t do it again. I get too attached, so no more stickers.\n\nIf you were an animal, what would you be?\n\nThis seems so basic, but I feel like I’d be a dog. I’m easily excited about stuff. I’m pretty much always in a good mood and pretty happy. I like being around people, which I think is true for most dogs. So maybe a dog, or a puppy – something that likes to play.\n\nWho is someone you have considered a role model and how have they helped guide you in your life or career?\n\nDefinitely my parents. From an early age, they taught my sister and me about perseverance and how to be confident and work hard and grit. They also exposed us to so many opportunities at a young age that I’m really appreciative of. More recently, I also think of my sister as a role model. It’s been so interesting working with her, and seeing this new perspective where she’s not just my younger sister anymore. She has a career and is respected by her peers, and it’s fun to see her really own her job and do so well.\n\nWhat’s a quote you reflect on, you mention to people a lot, or that motivates you?\n\nIt’s one that my mom said ever since my sister (Elenore) and I were so young and it’s from Eleanor Roosevelt: “No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.” As a young kid, it definitely was true. Like when you aren’t wearing the coolest clothes, or you just don’t feel as cool – as long as I’m confident in myself, nothing else matters. And now, as I’ve grown older, it’s also true. I did this big career change, and so sometimes I don’t necessarily feel like I’m the best UX designer, or that I know the most. But as long as I’m confident in myself, and as long as I put in my best effort, I can always do the best job.\n\nListen in to hear Audrey’s and Chris’ full conversation:\n\nMore blogs in the Meet the Team series\n\nMeet the Chronosphere team: Mary Fesenko, software engineer\n\nMeet the Chronosphere team: Shreyas Srivatsan, Member of Technical Staff\n\nMeet the Team: Alec Holmes, Member of Technical Staff\n\nMeet the Chronosphere Team: Elenore Bastian, Engineering Manager\n\nMeet the Chronosphere Team: Nate Broyles, Member of Technical Staff\n\nMeet the Chronosphere Team: Ting Chen, Member of Technical Staff\n\nIn today’s Meet the Chronosphere Team profile, we pivot to the hardworking front-end team. Ting Chen is a UI engineer who joined Chronosphere’s New York crew (also our largest) less than five months ago. As a developer who has been on-call, Ting brings first-hand experience to his work on new distributed tracing capabilities Chronosphere just added to our observability platform. After reading (or listening to) the interview below, you’ll find out how a UI engineer like Ting is a product of many interesting parts – whether it’s enjoying a technical challenge in his work, being a foodie, admiring the beauty of art, or drawing from the inspiration his family has provided.\n\nWhat do you do at Chronosphere?\n\nI’m a UI engineer on the platform team. I’ve had the opportunity to work on a range of features for our web app such as building a standalone site for our documentation, a dashboard to manage the user permissions, and also visualization for our new tracing feature.\n\nWhat were some of the reasons you decided to come to Chronosphere?\n\nFor quite some time, I’ve wanted to work at a startup company. However, I’ve also been pretty picky with the startups that I want to join since I’ve seen a lot of them struggle for years before finally simmering out. I got excited with Chronosphere because it popped into my radar from two separate instances; first at work while I was at DoorDash – our teams suddenly got shifted to prioritize integrating Chronosphere – then from a friend who decided after many years to leave Square to join Chronosphere. After speaking to my friend, he told me all about the team and the mission. I found out that Chronosphere was only a series B company and got the business of a client as big as DoorDash; I felt like they were doing something right. The more I learned about Chronosphere’s team, the more I wanted to join. It was a small company where I could make a large impact, but it was also a team that was composed of brilliant senior developers from top companies like Uber, Square, and Pivotal. When I joined, it became clear to me that these engineers laid the foundation for a great company, bringing all the best coding practices and processes together in order to make an awesome observability product.\n\nWhat did you do before coming to Chronosphere?\n\nI was building food delivery apps at Caviar and then after we got acquired, at DoorDash.\n\nWhat is the most interesting technical challenge Chronosphere is solving?\n\nI think the most interesting/fun technical challenge is in data visualization. Not only is it a pretty new space for me, but I think it’s interesting to take all the data we have and present it in a way that’s easily understandable to our end users. That’s part of the UI challenge – to take complex data and simplify it. In addition, there are some cool scaling and data ingestion challenges on the backend side that we also need to handle on the frontend. I’m not working on that personally, but there’s just so much complexity over there. Honestly, it’s hard to get my head wrapped around. While building our dashboards, we need to think about how we present all the data we have in a performant way, without oversimplifying our data to a point where it’s not really useful to people anymore.\n\nWhat are you working on right now that you’re excited about?\n\nI’m excited about the tracing project that we’re building. Having been on-call in the past, it’s important to be able to triage the issue as quickly as possible, and I think tracing is one of those features that will really help with that. And as I mentioned earlier, this has some cool visualization challenges; based on the data we’ve collected, how can we present the data in a way that would allow an engineer to quickly identify the issue from a glance? We’re looking at different solutions, such as D3, Visx, and Apache ECharts libraries, for providing the visualization – whether that’s a directed graph or a sankey diagram – that would, just by opening the page, allow the engineer to immediately identify the problem.\n\nWhat’s a fun fact about you that nobody would guess?\n\nMaybe it’s not too far-fetched since I am a UI engineer, but up till I was headed to college, my main passion was drawing and painting and I wanted to be an artist. I had even gotten into art school and planned on doing a dual degree in engineering and art, but quickly realized there was no way to do both without sacrificing all my sleep. I chose to do engineering instead.\n\nWhat stickers are on your laptop?\n\nI don’t like putting stickers on my laptop. I consider myself to be a minimalist and I think there’s beauty to the construction of the laptop that would be ruined by slapping on a sticker. Similar to bumper stickers on cars, it sends all kinds of confusing messages, especially when the purchased product was meant to be sleek and simple.\n\nIf you were an animal, what would you be?\n\nI’d probably be a panda. They seem like super chill animals that love to eat. I can resonate with that.\n\nWho is someone you have considered a role model and how have they helped guide you in your life or career?\n\nThroughout my life, I’ve considered different people role models. I’m fortunate to have two older brothers I could observe to determine what to do and what behaviors to avoid (at school and around my parents). Later on in my career, taking that same mentality, I sought mentors who could also share with me their successes and failures so that I could learn from them.\n\nAs for celebrity role models, Hayao Miyazaki has always been an inspiration to me for his attention to detail to the subtleties of often overlooked beauty in art.\n\nFinally, I’ve always considered my parents my longest running role models. They sacrificed a ton to immigrate to the US and they’re both blue collar workers that have had multiple jobs to give us a good life in the states. I’m motivated to work hard to give them an easier life as they have done for me.\n\nWhat’s a quote you reflect on, you mention to people a lot, or that motivates you?\n\nA quote that motivates me is, “You don’t have to be great to get started, but you have to get started to be great.” This probably falls in the same vein of, “A large task can be very daunting until you break it down into smaller pieces.” Data visualization is something that I’m not an expert at, but I’m confident that as long as I get started and learn something new everyday, I’m going to become pretty proficient at a cool new skill.\n\n~~~\n\nStay tuned for more profiles on Chronospherians and check out our open roles here.\n\nListen in to hear Ting’s and Chris Ward’s full conversation:\n\nMore blogs in the Meet the Team series\n\nMeet the Chronosphere team: Mary Fesenko, software engineer\n\nMeet the Chronosphere team: Shreyas Srivatsan, Member of Technical Staff\n\nMeet the Team: Alec Holmes, Member of Technical Staff\n\nMeet the Chronosphere Team: Elenore Bastian, Engineering Manager\n\nMeet the Chronosphere Team: Nate Broyles, Member of Technical Staff\n\nMeet the Chronosphere Team: Audrey Bastian, UX Designer\n\nIn today’s Meet the Chronosphere Team profile, we hand the microphone to Elenore who manages the Platform team … and who unflinchingly responded with “people” and “learning opportunity” when asked why she joined Chronosphere. Culture-building is a key component of Chronosphere’s values and we’re thrilled to have a people-person like Elenore on our engineering team. During her 10 months at Chronosphere, Elenore has gotten ramped up on the world of monitoring, observability, and metrics! Elenore joins our interview from her location on the West Coast and shares fun insights about life at Chronosphere.\n\nWhat do you do at Chronosphere?\n\nI’m the manager for the Platform team, and the Platform team is everything to do with how users interact with the product. It’s the UI (user interface) – the front end – as well as behind the scenes stuff like the API and the CLI and all the components we integrate with.\n\nWhat were some of the reasons you decided to come to Chronosphere?\n\nThe people, one hundred percent. I could tell the team was committed to ramping everybody up, to investing in each other – I’m brand new to monitors, observability, metrics, and that whole world and Chronosphere felt like a safe space to learn.\n\nWhat did you do before coming to Chronosphere?\n\nI was at a company called Pivotal for a long time, and Pivotal got acquired by VMware. So I was at VMware for a little bit and I just wasn’t into it – so I hopped over to Chronosphere.\n\nWhat is the most interesting challenge Chronosphere is solving?\n\nI think a big challenge we’re facing right now – which isn’t super technical but it’s something I think about a lot – is thinking about our product as a whole across all the touch points. How do we present Chronosphere’s ✨vibe✨ to our customers? How are they interacting with the UI and the CLI, and how do we make those interactions seamless and consistent?\n\nWhat are you working on right now that you’re excited about?\n\nI’ve just collected a bunch of peer feedback for all of my reports and I’m really excited to write that up and share it out – it was all really positive and I’m really excited to start building feedback as a habit and not as a chore. I’m hoping to show peer feedback is beneficial, productive, easy – not scary, or an overhead of process. I want the engineers to be giving feedback to each other all the time, but one thing that makes that really hard is being remote, and the pandemic, and not all knowing each other, and not all being in the office. It just comes less naturally, so I’m trying to think of better ways for us to have those organic conversations.\n\nSometimes it’s hard to hear feedback, so I wanted people to come up with ideas or growth goals for themselves. Like, “I want to be a better leader on my team by making sure I share the right amount of context and information.” I’m asking very pointed questions around specific goals, and that’s been helpful in that people are picking out what they want feedback on – essentially taking ownership over their growth.\n\nWhat’s a fun fact about you that nobody would guess?\n\nWhen I was 18 and a senior in high school, I won a pageant. It had all the pageant things like a big dress and a tiara. It’s a very small town thing.\n\nWhat stickers are on your laptop?\n\nI have a Pacific Northwest Native American totem pole. And I have a sticker of my cat, Owen.\n\nIf you were an animal, what would you be?\n\nI would be an alien. Or Sasquatch. I love conspiracy theories, so I would pick something like that.\n\nWho is someone you have considered a role model and how have they helped guide you in your life or career?\n\nMy parents. Both my parents are in positions of leadership – they’re both judges. For my mom, as a female judge, I think you just get more flack, more scrutiny, than your male counterparts – like you can get as a woman in tech. You can bottle up some of that frustration and anger and have that control your life. But you can also just let it go. I’ve been learning how to do that over the years. My dad’s also a judge, and he is very thoughtful. Being thoughtful and empathetic is helpful as a manager, and in software in general!\n\nWhat’s a quote you reflect on, you mention to people a lot, or that motivates you?\n\nAt work, every problem is a communication problem – pretty much always. So if people are having problems, I ask, “How can we communicate better? Where are the gaps in communication?”\n\n~~~\n\nStay tuned for more profiles on Chronospherians and check out our open roles here.

In today’s “Meet the Chronosphere Team” profile, you’ll get to know Alec Holmes, a critical member of our growing West Coast Team. Alec joined the team almost a year ago, and in this piece, he tells us about his career in software development, what drew him to Chronosphere, and what inspires him.\n\nWhat do you do at Chronosphere?\n\nI work in engineering, and because of the nature of startups, I tend to jump around a little bit. My primary focus, however, is centered around the part of our product that is helping customers track the health of their various systems. Lately this involves refining how customers manage their alerting configuration and how they build out various systems to support that. This ends up touching on a couple of different areas of the product. Some of my time is spent just sitting at my keyboard and coding, but I also spend a fair amount of time collaborating with others on ideas and architecture.\n\nWhat were some of the reasons you decided to join Chronosphere?\n\nThere are quite a few lists of reasons, so I’ll narrow it down a little bit. One of the really big ones for me is the team of people that I’m working with. I’ve always found that I’m happiest when I’m working in a team of people that are all very collaborative and supportive and working in sync. That’s something that I’ve found at Chronosphere. And what drew me in is – I knew a couple of people to start with, and then as I went through the interview process and met various people in various roles, I really liked the people I met and I had a really good feeling. I just want to work with really great people who will help me learn. Beyond the team is what we’re building here. It is something I’ve always been interested in and felt is pretty important. In past roles, I’ve worked in areas that have used observability platforms and I’ve never been quite satisfied. For me, when Chronosphere came along, it felt like the right time to join something early enough where you can really help shape what we’re doing. That was very compelling.\n\nWhat did you do before coming to Chronosphere?\n\nThe last thing that I was working on prior to Chronosphere was at the FinTech company, Square. I was there for about eight-and-a half years. I was kind of lucky because it was such a long time, and the company grew a lot during that time, so I was able to touch on a couple of different parts of the business. I started off working on their payments infrastructure – working on the systems that process credit card payments and make sure that the small merchants they support get paid every day. I also worked on their public developer API platform. The last stretch there was working for the Cash App part of the business. I was helping build their cloud infrastructure. It turns out that last stint on the Cash App ended up leading to my work at Chronosphere. A lot of the platform work we were doing there, and a lot of the problems we were trying to deal with, are the ones that Chronosphere is solving.\n\nWhat is the most interesting technical challenge Chronosphere is solving?\n\nWe talk a lot about scaling metrics and scaling the metric storage engine. That’s an extremely interesting problem, but I actually don’t work that much on those types of problems at Chronosphere. The ones I’m really interested in solving right now are scalability in two aspects around what we internally call “triage”, which is helping customers understand, quickly, when something is going wrong in their systems and helping them mitigate it.\n\nOne problem, which isn’t immediately technical, is that the customers we tend to target are quite large and have sprawling organizational structures. When these companies are trying to define alerting configuration, it’s not one small group of people doing it. It’s hundreds or thousands of people across many different business lines. The first challenge that we’ve had to start facing is – when there’s all this information they need to model in the observability space, how can we represent it for them so they can navigate it very naturally and not be overwhelmed by the sheer number of things that they’re looking at? When we’re designing some of our newer observability systems, we’ve had to really think about what concepts will make this natural to scale from a small customer to a large customer. From a conceptual model, that’s been very interesting.\n\nOn a more technical side, this all comes with challenges on the backend as well. If you’re a customer and you have thousands, or tens of thousands, of constantly executing alerts, we want to ensure those are running smoothly, they execute on time, and the data that’s coming back is correct and usable. Part of the challenge of building out the backend for easily navigable alert structures is that you want it to be fast and reliable and snappy, and that technically can be quite challenging to build.\n\nWhat are you working on right now that you’re excited about?\n\nWhat I’m mainly working on right now is rolling out a pretty significant revamp of how we let customers manage their alerting. We’re moving towards a model that’s more flexible and allows a lot more reusability around the parameters people define. One of the first things that I started on when I joined here was actually working with the head of product and head of design to step back and think about what are the important concepts we need to think about. We gradually worked from there to build out a model, and then from there to build out a pretty huge change to the backend to support this. It’s been months in the making and we are just starting to roll it out now. There’s excitement in seeing something you’ve been working on finally come to fruition, and seeing it in the hands of the customers actually using it.\n\nWhat’s a fun fact about you that nobody would guess?\n\nOne fun fact is I spent most of my childhood growing up in the suburbs outside of New York City, which is probably something anyone could guess. But the fun fact aspect of it is, for five years, when I was a teenager, I lived with my family in Tokyo, which was pretty amazing. I was very lucky as a kid to be able to run around this huge city with free rein. I was definitely very disappointed to move back and then not have a drivers licence and be stuck in the woods.\n\nWhat stickers are on your laptop?\n\nI am admittedly not much of a sticker person, so I don’t have any stickers on my laptops. I do have one single fridge magnet, which is an Eskimo holding a snow cone that I got in Iceland, but nothing on my laptop. I think if I were pressed, and had to put a sticker on, there’s a coffee shop around here I really like, called Andytown. I do notice when I buy my coffee at the register, they have a lot of very adorable stickers of birds holding coffee cups and things like that. I think that would probably be the first sticker to come.\n\nIf you were an animal, what would you be?\n\nThis is probably the opposite of the fun fact question in that everyone would guess it, at least people who know me and work with me: I would be a cat. For those who know me, I am a cat enthusiast. But beyond that, I think they have a good life. They spend half the time exploring and just kind of roaming around and learning new things, seeing new things. And the other half they’re just lounging and enjoying life.\n\nWho is someone you have considered a role model and how have they helped guide you in your life or career?\n\nI’m one of those people that has the mentality of “it takes a village,” so there might not be one singular person, but there’s certainly a lot of people over time. To give a few examples, when I was a kid in middle school, I was very lucky in that I had a teacher there who ran the computer lab, who basically saw that I liked computer things. And was not only very encouraging, but gave me books on programming and showed me the ropes a little bit. That was probably the first example of someone who really recognized what I liked and helped me learn how to explore that.\n\nWhen it comes to my career now, and where I’ve been going the past few years, it was during my time at Square that I was really able to mature a lot as an engineer. And I credit that with that company – just having a lot of very bright, very thoughtful people. When I was there, I had a bunch of leads that were very thoughtful about helping me plan my career path and giving me really good feedback – that went a really long way. Beyond that, I’ve also throughout my career become friends with a lot of peers I’ve worked with. What that’s ended up being for me is having not only friends, but a social support network where we all act as sounding boards to sometimes talk about very deep-in-the-weeds, technical things, and sometimes talk about the long arc of where we want to go as software engineers.\n\nWhat’s a quote you reflect on, you mention to people a lot, or that motivates you?\n\nThere is one quote I’ve always really enjoyed. It’s from James Baldwin, and the quote is, “Not everything that is faced can be changed. But nothing can be changed until it is faced.” I like the quote because I think life in general is full of challenges at various levels – some are personal, some are community, and some are global. I think it’s a good reminder that even when problems are huge, and sometimes feel almost insurmountable, that you can never make any progress until you just take that first step. It’s a quote I like that passes through my mind from time to time.\n\nIt’s always fun to hear someone in their own words.

      "# [What is a Telemetry Pipeline by Erik Bledsoe on 2024-05-30](https://chronosphere.io/learn/what-is-a-telemetry-pipeline/)\nWith the move to cloud native applications and microservices architecture, the volume of data generated has exploded. By some estimations, cloud native environments emit 10x and 100x more data than traditional VM-based environments.\n\nYet, logs, metrics, traces, and event data (collectively known as telemetry or observability data) all contain information that teams need to monitor performance, troubleshoot issues, and reduce mean time to remediate (MTTR). The ever-increasing volume of data makes it harder for teams to locate actionable insights amongst all the noise and increases the costs of storing and analyzing the data.\n\nToday, many companies leverage observability and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms to collect, store, and analyze telemetry data. However, with the increase in data volume, data sources, and data destinations, companies need more comprehensive tools to collect, transform, and route telemetry data before sending it to these backend systems.\n\nEnter the telemetry pipeline. Telemetry pipelines enable organizations to receive data from multiple sources, enrich, transform, redact, and reduce it before routing it to its intended destinations for storage and analysis. The result is that organizations are able to control their data from collection to backend destination, reducing the complexity of managing multiple pipelines, reducing the volume of data sent to backend systems, and decreasing backend costs.\n\nThis post provides an introduction to the telemetry pipeline. It provides a quick overview of what telemetry pipelines do and how they differ from the observability and SIEM platforms with which they integrate. Along the way, we offer some advice about why you may — or may not — need a telemetry pipeline solution.\n\nTo better understand what a telemetry pipeline does, let’s compare it to what observability and SIEM platforms do. In an admitted oversimplification, observability platforms and SIEMs:\n\ncollect data\n\nroute data\n\nstore data\n\nanalyze data\n\nObservability platforms give developers and infrastructure teams visibility into their software applications and environments and provide insight into the state of their applications and infrastructure. SIEM platforms, on the other hand, are concerned with security information and events. Security teams use SIEM platforms to recognize and address potential security threats and vulnerabilities before they disrupt business. Both platforms may use some of the same data, especially logs, but they examine it through different lenses.\n\nThe collection of data is typically handled by an agent, a small application running on or adjacent to the data source that gathers logs, metrics, and/or traces and delivers them to the platform for storage. Collector agents are the worker bees of observability and SIEM platforms, tirelessly gathering data and delivering it back to the hive (platform) for the good of the larger organization. These agents are often proprietary, and can only be used to route data exclusively to the vendor’s platform. Some platforms may allow the use of open source agents like Fluent Bit or the OTel collector instead of proprietary agents. However, be cautious; in some cases, they actually require forked versions of these open source collectors that have been engineered to work specifically with their platform.\n\nLarge organizations may require hundreds or even thousands of collectors, spread out across Kubernetes pods, VMs, and other infrastructure. When platforms require vendor-specific agents they further tighten the screws of vendor lock-in — to switch platforms, organizations must not only face the pain of the platform change itself, but must also contend with uninstalling all of their collector agents, and installing and configuring new ones that work with the new platform.\n\nWithout a dedicated telemetry pipeline solution, the process of moving data from multiple sources to multiple destinations can become quite complex. It’s not unusual to see architectures that resemble something like this:\n\nA dedicated telemetry pipeline solution can tame the tangle. Vendor-neutral agents replace multiple vendor-specific agents. Multiple intermediaries are eliminated as data flows through a single solution for routing to multiple destinations.\n\nA simplified architecture is easier to maintain, and built-in integrations make onboarding new sources or destinations much faster. As a result, developers are freed up to focus on writing the code and building the applications that will drive their businesses rather than writing custom connectors and transformations.\n\nTransforming and processing data in the pipeline reduces the stress on the endpoint platform. If a platform stores log files as JSON, for example, the telemetry pipeline can handle the intensive process of converting raw log files into structured data ready for storage and analysis.\n\nBecause telemetry pipelines sit between the data sources and the data destinations, they can access information about sources that would typically be unavailable further downstream. This is particularly true for ephemeral containerized environments. The pipeline application can then enrich the telemetry data with this additional context before routing it to its final destination where teams can then use it to troubleshoot issues.\n\nThe pipeline’s proximity to the data sources makes it ideal for removing or redacting sensitive data that should not be made available to downstream systems. This is an essential step for some compliance regulations.\n\nTelemetry pipelines can also significantly reduce the amount of data delivered to platform endpoints. They do so by identifying and dropping duplicate records, and, more significantly, by applying rules to filter out unnecessary data. It’s a trivial matter, for instance, to eliminate all debug-level logs if desired. Judicial filtering rules eliminate noisy data, making it easier for observability and security teams to derive true insights from their platforms. Since many platforms charge based on the amount of data stored and processed, reducing the data flow can result in significant cost savings as well.\n\nVendors know that the time, effort, and expense associated with replacing their platforms with a competitor give them an advantage when it comes to contract renewals. Dedicated telemetry pipelines can shift the balance of power, giving organizations more control over their data. They can eliminate the necessity of swapping out thousands of collector agents. Business logic applied to data in flight does not need to be recreated. Changing destinations becomes a configuration change. The time, effort, and expense of ripping and replacing drops dramatically, and renewal negotiations can become more equitable.\n\nOf course, no major system migration is without its pain points. However, having a telemetry pipeline can significantly reduce them. In fact, organizations that are unhappy with their platforms sometimes integrate a telemetry pipeline as a preliminary step to migrating to a better platform.",
