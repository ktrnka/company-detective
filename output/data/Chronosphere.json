      "# [Cloud Observability Solutions on 2023-08-10](https://chronosphere.io/solutions/)\nInfrastructure metrics are the backbone of your observability implementation. This is especially true in a cloud native infrastructure environment. With an efficient cloud infrastructure monitoring solution that was purpose-built to reliably handle the scale of cloud native, you will know about issues before your customers do.\n\nChronosphere ingests a variety of open source infrastructure metrics formats from Prometheus to Graphite/StatsD and ships with out of the box dashboards like cAdvisor that give you instant insight into your Kubernetes clusters making Kubernetes monitoring easy.\n\nWith Prometheus, you can export infrastructure metrics from virtually any server, database, or service mesh. Monitoring infrastructure is a foundational to your observability strategy.\n\nApplication performance monitoring (APM,) or the task of troubleshooting application errors or performance issues, is no easy feat in a distributed microservices environment. With Chronosphere, engineers of any experience level can understand the root cause of issues via the insights provided by the automated analysis of the underlying Observability data.\n\nHarnessing the power of distributed tracing via OpenTelemetry, your tangled mess of microservices goes from unintelligible to understandable. The results? Fewer incidents, faster resolution, happier customers and developers thanks to the power of cloud native application monitoring.\n\nWhen your business moves at the speed of cloud, you can’t wait hours or days to understand business impact. With Chronosphere’s millisecond ingest and one second alert intervals, you can react to business metrics like revenue flow and customer engagement in seconds.\n\nWith a single solution that can connect infrastructure errors through to application performance all the way up to business impacts, you always have a 360 degree view of your business performance.\n\nCloud native environments produce massive amounts of telemetry data. Developers need this data to effectively operate and troubleshoot systems, but it quickly leads to observability costs spiraling out of control.\n\nWith Chronosphere, you still collect all the same data, but it’s aggregated and transformed into actionable insight that is usable for developers, while also being highly cost efficient. The result is greater predictability, increased accountability, and significant cost savings.\n\nWhen customer-facing issues arise, your developers need the best tools to solve these issues, fast. Chronosphere rapidly orients developers to the problem at hand with context-rich alerts and seamless linking of data types for faster time to triage. With a solution that is accessible for all levels of developers, you will no longer have your most senior resources pulled into every incident response.\n\nThe results? When you can scale reliably and meet customer demand, you’ll see increased revenue and less customer churn.\n\nWhen your observability solution is unreliable, the entire organization suffers. Developers can’t ship code, or worse, fly blind during an outage. They spend longer on troubleshooting, which means they are slower to deliver new features, which in turn frustrates customers and puts revenue at risk.\n\nWith Chronosphere, you gain an observability platform that is reliable, scalable, and performant, so engineers spend less time in the weeds and more time innovating\n\nWhile many organizations begin their cloud native observability journey with open source tools like Prometheus or Jaeger, they quickly run into major hurdles. The two big challenges that companies face when running their own open source observability in-house is the significant management overhead and tooling that is unreliable and slow.\n\nWith Chronosphere, you get the best of both worlds: a fully open source compatible solution that relieves the management overview and delivers best in class availability and performance.

      "# [FAQs on 2023-08-10](https://chronosphere.io/faqs/)\nChronosphere’s Observability Platform\n\nThe Chronosphere platform can ingest metrics, events, logs and distributed trace data in a variety of open source formats, such as Prometheus and OpenTelemetry, and gives teams the ability to cut through the noise to rapidly detect, understand and remediate issues before they impact customers.\n\nChronosphere’s Telemetry Pipeline\n\nChronosphere Telemetry Pipeline, from the creators of Fluent Bit and Calyptia, streamlines log collection, aggregation, transformation, and routing from any source to any destination.\n\nThis allows companies who are dealing with high costs and complexity the ability to control their data and scale their growing business needs.\n\nMonitoring data is growing faster than infrastructure/apps built to monitor it, and the increase in scale has created bottlenecks for reliability, performance and cost.\n\nThe result is that you often end up flying blind because metrics are not available or are too hard to find quickly. When surges in metric cardinality or read traffic happen in solutions not built for this level of complexity, it gets very expensive, very fast, the problem gets ignored, or the dashboards take too long to load, leading to system failures.\n\nWith Chronosphere, users have tools to help them understand their metric data in real-time, and filter/group by any metric labels to understand what the biggest contributors to write traffic are.\n\nChronosphere Observability Platform has a unique pricing model that is different from others out there. Instead of pricing based on host or VM, Chronosphere only charges for the useful data that you choose to retain in the Chronosphere Observability Platform. With our Control Plane, you can analyze and shape your observability data to fulfill your existing dashboard and alerting needs without having to store all the data in the raw form. Unlike other observability solutions that require you to store, query, and pay for all data, whether or not it is useful, Chronosphere pre-computes the data to get rid of the waste and efficiently delivers it to the glass.\n\nEvery organization’s needs are very different, so we want to work with you to drive the right value at the right price, without the fear of overages or huge price hikes when your data complexity inevitably grows.\n\nFor the Chronosphere Telemetry Pipeline, we follow a straightforward pricing model, based solely on data throughput – the volume of raw data you transmit through the pipeline. We understand that every team’s needs are different, so we work with you to drive the right value at the right price.\n\nWe offer a flexible support model to meet your needs. We have dedicated customer success resources and offer 24/7 x 365 communications by Slack, Zendesk, or e-mail, in addition to options for weekly office hours, ad-hoc calls, and shared Slack channels. You are assigned a customer success architect, solution architect, and account executive that you’ll have direct access to.\n\nAre you a customer needing to access our team or get a question answered? Reach out to our support team here, and someone will be with you ASAP!\n\nDue to the highly customized nature of each organization’s observability aggregation and rollup needs, we will work with you to stand up a pilot. The onboarding process depends on the scale of the deployment, but the goal is to prove out the required capabilities.\n\nPilots are typically free, unless you are running a large scale or long term pilot. The average pilot is 2-3 weeks long, during which you’ll be able to try out Chronosphere with your actual production data, with longer-term evaluations possible (most likely a paid pilot for long durations of evaluation).\n\nWe will work with you to tune control plane policies, define different resolution, and retention policies specific to your needs, and you will have full access to the same support you’d get as a Chronosphere customer. Ready to start a pilot? Click here to speak to our experts about your needs.\n\nThe Chronosphere collector is responsible for ingesting metrics and traces from a customer’s various applications and then sending them along to the Chronosphere backend. It is the only Chronosphere software deployed in customer environments. You can set up as many collectors as you need.\n\nFor a full explanation of how it works, check out our blog post on how Chronosphere collects metrics.\n\nChronosphere is a flexible SaaS solution, built for scaling cloud native engineering organizations.\n\nThe Chronosphere platform can ingest metrics and distributed trace data in a variety of open source formats, as well as Chronosphere collector instances which are the only pieces of technology that needs to be deployed by customers.The datastore and dashboards are fully provided and managed by Chronosphere.\n\nCustomers can manage their configuration through our Terraform provider or a command-line tool, in addition to through the UI.\n\nWe have a 99.9% SLA, calculated on a per-tenant basis.\n\nAvailability is determined continuously and automatically by monitoring for tenant downtime by having an external probe write a randomly generated datapoint and read it back, to verify that the platform is successfully persisting data and the whole end to end flow is working.\n\nWe calculate the SLA specifically for your tenant, not everyone, with a focus on the ability to read and write data.\n\nLearn more about our Commitment to Availability.\n\nChronosphere Telemetry Pipeline follows a hybrid or bring your own cloud (BYOC) architecture pattern by default. This means the data plane (where data processing occurs) is deployed in your environment, while Chronosphere hosts the management plane (where commands are issued).\n\nThis deployment model allows for rapid deployment of multiple core instances within different environments or clouds. For example, you can have five Telemetry Pipeline core instances deployed across Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, your private data center, and even your laptop.\n\nTelemetry Pipeline does not require any inbound network connections and instead only require a single outbound connection the management plane\n\nThis architecture gives the following advantages:\n\nFaster processing and lower latency: When the data plane is deployed closer to the data source, there are less latency and network hops required.\n\nIncreased data privacy: With data collection and processing staying within the environment, there is less risk of data leaking out of the environment outside of its sovereignty or compliance boundary. Chronosphere has no access to the underlying data.\n\nCost optimization: When data is processed (mainly reduced or removed) within your environment this can vastly decrease your bandwidth and egress charges within public cloud environments.",

      "# [Overview of alerting](https://docs.chronosphere.io/alerts)\nOne reason to ingest and store time series data is to know when data does or doesn't meet certain criteria. To generate alerts and notifications from data, regardless of whether it's about your system or about your use of Chronosphere Observability Platform itself, use alerting.\n\nYou create monitors to query time series, and optionally group results into signals. Whenever a time series meets a condition, an alert triggers that sends a notification. You can mute notifications with muting rules.\n\nMonitors\n\nObservability Platform alerting revolves around monitors. You can watch time series data that's specified in a monitor query. The results of a monitor query can be time series data or the outcome of a function applied to time series data. Because Observability Platform is a single data store, you can merge alerts, which lets an alert query all metrics and not only metrics local to a Prometheus instance.\n\nConditions\n\nConditions are evaluations run against every time series from the resulting monitor query, along with a related severity, such as critical or warning. For example, conditions can help you determine if a time series value remains greater than 1 for more than 30 seconds. If this happens, Observability Platform can display a warning alert.\n\nYou can also specify condition overrides to override the default conditions that define when an alert triggers for a monitor.\n\nSignals\n\nSignals are optional groupings by label of the results returned from a monitor query. For example, you can use signals to group time series from multiple environments, such as development or production, to generate separate alerts for each environment.\n\nIn Observability Platform, on the Monitors page, monitors with defined signals display the file tree icon. To view the signals from a displayed monitor, click the name of the monitor from the list.\n\nObservability Platform supports converting from Prometheus alerts to signals, and strongly recommends using signals instead of configuring complex routing trees to route notifications:\n\nYou can configure signals for individual monitors, which isolates changes to only that monitor. Prometheus requires a single global configuration, and any change impacts users across your entire organization.\n\nSignals let you group notifications within the monitor itself, rather than grouping notifications within the notification routing tree. This model makes signals easier to manage as part of a monitor configuration.\n\nAlerts\n\nAlerts occur when one or more monitor query results trigger a condition. Configuring the monitor signal to group query results generates an alert for each signal that triggers a condition.\n\nNotifications\n\nWhen an alert triggers, and optionally when an alert resolves, Observability Platform sends a notification to specified endpoints called notifiers, including PagerDuty, email, and Slack.

Keep the data you need to control costs and configure rules to drop the rest.\n\nMetrics data: Analyze your traffic and usage to identify opportunities to reduce the overall volume of metrics and understand the impact of proposed shaping rules.\n\nTrace data: Use sampling, datasets, and behaviors to manage the data you keep and discard to help control costs and maximize the usefulness of your trace data.\n\nTo reduce downtime and fix issues efficiently, you need to view the full picture of connected microservices and reduce your Mean Time To Repair (MTTR).\n\nConfigure alerts that trigger on specific conditions and provide developers with the necessary context to identify and resolve issues when problems occur.\n\nUse services to determine potential issues, and apply that context across several exploration tools to analyze metric, trace, log, and event data.\n\nChronosphere incorporates all of your telemetry in a single platform so you can act on trends, correlate changes in data to incidents, and monitor status in real time, all from a single location.\n\nUse Chronosphere Lens to identify services having problems.\n\nCreate dashboards and add visualizations of query results that you can customize, filter, and focus.\n\nBuild queries to drill deeper into telemetry data and gain greater context of an issue.\n\nGet started\n\nLearn more about the different features available in Observability Platform, and how you can interact with them to control and use your data more efficiently.",
      "# [Ingest telemetry data](https://docs.chronosphere.io/ingest)\nBefore you can use Chronosphere Observability Platform to view and manage your observability data (of whatever type), you need to get that data into Observability Platform.\n\nObservability Platform supports multiple methods to ingest telemetry data, which depend on which type of data you want to ingest:\n\nIngestion methodChange eventsLogsMetricsTracesChronosphere CollectorOpenTelemetry CollectorTelemetry Pipeline or Core AgentExisting pipelineDirect to Observability Platform\n\nAfter ingesting telemetry data, you can use the control mechanisms that Observability Platform provides to control costs and ensure you're ingesting only the data you care about.\n\nChronosphere utilizes push and pull models of ingestion, depending on the data collected and the method of ingestion.\n\nPull models, like the Chronosphere Collector, scrape data from external sources and pull it in. These metrics have consistent reporting intervals.\n\nPush models, like tracing, send data to Chronosphere, which is then processed. These metrics can have a broad spectrum of reporting frequency, from large bursts of data to long periods with no data reporting.\n\nTelemetryPushPullMetricsTracesLogs\n\nThe ingestion model depends on the data source. Metrics pushed to Observability Platform can have latency delays or sparse time series which can result in unexpected query results.\n\nMetric and trace data\n\nTo ingest metrics and traces, you must configure one of the collection methods. Use the Chronosphere Collector or OpenTelemetry Collector for metric and trace data. Google Cloud metrics can also be directly ingested.\n\nChange event data\n\nChange event data gets sent directly to Observability Platform, and doesn't require an independent collection mechanism. Use Observability Platform or CreateEvent API to send your change events (opens in a new tab).\n\nYou can also ingest change events directly from supported third-party tools such as Amazon EventBridge, Buildkite, and LaunchDarkly.\n\nLog data\n\nTo ingest log data, Chronosphere recommends using Core Agent or a combination of Core Agent plus Telemetry Pipeline. Chronosphere also supports using your existing ingest pipeline to ingest log data, such as Fluent Bit or LogStash. You can also ingest log data using the OpenTelemetry Collector.\n\nControl costs\n\nIngesting more telemetry data increases your overall data and storage costs. Observability Platform provides several control mechanisms to manage the data you ingest.\n\nMetric data\n\nUse the following methods to control the metric data you ingest:\n\nProfile and analyze metrics for their usage and cost.\n\nCreate drop rules to drop incoming metrics based on labels.\n\nShape metric data with quotas.\n\nReduce the persisted metrics and cardinality at the cost of increased writes.\n\nTracing data\n\nUse the following methods to control the tracing data you ingest:",
      "# [Investigate your data](https://docs.chronosphere.io/investigate)\nAfter ingesting your telemetry data, Chronosphere Observability Platform gives you access to all of your data to help identify issues and determine which services are causing latency.\n\nTo help understand your network's health, and to troubleshoot issues that arise, Observability Platform includes tools and features to provide actionable insights into each type of observability data you ingest.\n\nMetrics\n\nMetrics are aggregate measurements from your services and apps, such as a fixed number of periodic observations that record the count of requests handled over the span of a minute.\n\nObservability Platform adds, drops, and aggregates those statistics for use in dashboards, traces, and alerts.\n\nLive Telemetry Analyzer provides a real-time view of incoming metrics.\n\nTelemetry Usage Analyzer provides a list of all metrics in Observability Platform, with usage and storage data.\n\nMetrics Explorer helps you investigate query requests, responses, and statistics.\n\nDistributed traces\n\nDistributed tracing involves mapping and analyzing requests as they flow through a distributed system. Traces include spans that an app emits, and connects related spans together. Each span represents an operation or unit of work.\n\nTrace Explorer identifies traces where problems are occurring.\n\nTrace Analyzer lets you view traces in real-time. Use this information to help understand how often your applications emit traces, and to troubleshoot spikes in ingest rates.\n\nTrace Metrics lets you create metrics from your trace data. You can display that metric in a dashboard for faster discovery.\n\nChange events\n\nChange events are data elements that describe real world changes or events that could have affected your environment. Events let you answer questions like \"When did a particular service deploy last?\"\n\nChanges Explorer displays available change events to create a comprehensive view of all changes in your environment.\n\nLogs\n\nLogs represent data directly generated by apps and services, which you can ingest with Observability Platform to investigate issues with your systems and monitor their health.\n\nQuerying",
      "# [Chronoctl](https://docs.chronosphere.io/chronoctl)\nChronoctl is a Chronosphere-supplied app that lets you manage your organization's Chronosphere Observability Platform resources from the command line.\n\nFor example, to list your team's monitor definitions:\n\nGetting started\n\nTo install Chronoctl, see Install Chronoctl.\n\nTo use Chronoctl, you must provide an API token and organization name to authenticate as an account with administrative privileges, either by configuring them as environment variables or passing them with the command. You can also securely authenticate by using the chronoctl auth command.\n\nAfter you're ready to use Chronoctl, refer to its commands to directly control your Observability Platform environment.\n\nSupported resources\n\nUse Chronoctl commands to take actions on Observability Platform resources, such as dashboards, teams, or collections. To display a list of the resources supported by your installed version of Chronoctl, view the Chronoctl help:\n\nThe list of available resources displays in the Chronosphere Configuration section of the output.\n\nCommand list\n\nRequires Chronoctl version 0.53.0 or later.\n\nChronoctl is based on the structure of the Chronosphere API, which helps its commands be as consistent with one another as possible. This also better reflects features as they're presented for use in the Chronosphere API itself.\n\nFlags\n\nEach command has several flags for customizing its output or behavior.\n\nIn addition to the authentication flags, flags that are common among commands include:\n\n-h, --help: Outputs help text for the given command.\n\n--timeout: Defines a duration in seconds for the request before it times out and fails. Defaults to 30 seconds.\n\nChronoctl commands that return data representations of resources have additional common flags:\n\n-o, --output: Defines the output format. Accepts json for JSON, jsonl for JSON Lines, or defaults to yaml for YAML.\n\nChronoctl commands that can change the state of a resource in Observability Platform, such as chronoctl apply or resource create and update subcommands, also have:\n\n-d, --dry-run: If set, Chronoctl simulates but doesn't apply the manifest or change in a dry run, and then displays the predicted result.\n\n--no-strict: If set, Chronoctl accepts manifests or changes that contain unknown fields.\n\nSlugs\n\nObservability Platform identifies each resource by a unique slug, which has a 255-character length limit and contains only letters, numbers, underscores (_), and dashes (-). Slugs are case-sensitive. By default, Observability Platform generates a random slug (containing less than 255 characters) for each resource. Chronoctl lets you optionally specify a slug when creating resources.\n\nConfiguration commands\n\nConfiguration commands are the recommended way to interact with Observability Platform resources. Use the apply command for interacting with multiple resources, but in most cases, uses the configuration commands.\n\nEach of these commands are specific to Observability Platform resource types, which have the same following subcommands:\n\ncreate\n\ndelete\n\nlist\n\nread\n\nscaffold\n\nupdate\n\ncreate\n\nCreates one resource of the given type. For example:\n\nReplace the following:\n\nRESOURCE: The resource you want to take action on.\n\nFILE_NAME: The name of the definition file you want to use.\n\nFor more information about the subcommand, including its usage and accepted flags, see the Chronoctl command line help.\n\nReplace RESOURCE with the resource you want to take action on.\n\ndelete\n\nDeletes one resource of the given type. For example:\n\nReplace the following:\n\nRESOURCE: The resource you want to take action on.\n\nSLUG: The slug of the resource you want to delete.\n\nFor more information about the subcommand, including its usage and accepted flags, see the Chronoctl command line help.\n\nReplace RESOURCE with the resource you want to take action on.\n\nlist\n\nLists all resources of the given type. For example:\n\nReplace RESOURCE with the resource you want to take action on.\n\nFor more information about the subcommand, including its usage and accepted flags, see the Chronoctl command line help.\n\nReplace RESOURCE with the resource you want to take action on.\n\nread\n\nOutputs one resource of the given type. For example:\n\nReplace the following:\n\nRESOURCE: The resource you want to take action on.\n\nSLUG: The slug of the resource you want to output.\n\nFor more information about the subcommand, including its usage and accepted flags, see the Chronoctl command line help.\n\nReplace RESOURCE with the resource you want to take action on.\n\nscaffold\n\nOutputs an example resource definition of the given type, including inline comments documenting its properties. For example:\n\nReplace RESOURCE with the resource you want to take action on.\n\nupdate\n\nUpdates a resource of the given type. For example:\n\nReplace the following:\n\nRESOURCE: The resource you want to take action on.\n\nFILE_NAME: The name of the definition file you want to use.\n\nFor more information about the subcommand, including its usage and accepted flags, see the Chronoctl command line help.\n\nReplace RESOURCE with the resource you want to take action on.\n\nCore commands\n\nChronoctl core commands are independent of any resource type.\n\napply\n\nApplies a configuration change to resources from a YAML or JSON file, or from standard input. When you apply resources with Chronoctl, Observability Platform creates them if they don't already exist.\n\nThe apply command accepts input from a file by providing the path as the value of the -f (--filename) flag.\n\nFor example, to apply a file containing a resource's YAML manifest:\n\nTo apply a resource passed from standard input, use the - value of the -f flag:\n\nUpon success, the command returns the list of changes applied.\n\nThe apply command accepts the dry run (-d, --dry-run) flag, which displays the changes without applying them.\n\nauth\n\nRequires Chronoctl version 1.8.0 or later (or Chronoctl 0.65.0 or later if you're using a version earlier than 1.0.0).\n\nHandles secure programmatic access to Observability Platform. This command lets users access their organizations' applications after authentication with Chronoctl.\n\nlogin: Authenticate the Chronoctl session as your Observability Platform user.\n\nlist: List all authenticated Observability Platform organizations the current user can access. Users might have access to multiple organizations such as a production and a test organization.\n\nprint-session-id: Print the stored session id for an Observability Platform organization.\n\nset-default-org: Sets the default Observability Platform organization for future commands.\n\nTo sign in, use this command:\n\nReplace YOUR-ORG-NAME with the organization you want to sign in to. For example, if your Observability Platform tenant is https://acme.chronosphere.io, replace YOUR-ORG-NAME with acme, and then follow the prompts.\n\nThis process generates a session_ID, which is cached on your machine and valid for 24 hours. If a personal access token or service account token isn't passed to Chronoctl using an environment variable or command line flag, Chronoctl uses the cached session_ID to authenticate your command.\n\nState commands\n\nThese commands evaluate the current state of Observability Platform.\n\nrule-evaluations list\n\nThe list subcommand is the only subcommand for rule-evaluations.\n\nReturns a list of rule evaluation failures, including the rule's type, slug, failure count, message, and detection timestamp.\n\nSync commands\n\nThe sync command accepts the prometheus subcommand only. Use the sync prometheus command to sync a Prometheus rules YAML file and a Prometheus Alertmanager YAML configuration file into Chronosphere format.\n\nYou include a chronoconfig.yaml file to assign the rules to a team, and to specify a team to own the related notification policy. This command converts and applies the assets and resources to your tenant.\n\nTo sync Prometheus rules into Chronosphere format:\n\nDefine a chronoconfig.yaml file to assign the converted rules to a team, and specify a team to own the related notification policy:\n\nuse_collections:\"TRUE\" group_teams: - group_regex:\".*\" team_slug:\"OWNER_TEAM\" notification_policy_team_slug:\"POLICY_TEAM\"\n\nReplace the following:\n\nOWNER_TEAM: The slug of the Observability Platform team to own the converted rules.\n\nPOLICY_TEAM: The slug of the Observability Platform team to own the notification policy.\n\nRun the sync prometheus command and pass in your Prometheus rules file, Prometheus Alertmanager configuration file, and chronoconfig.yaml file:\n\nchronoctlsyncprometheus-a [ALERTMANAGER_CONFIG] -p [PROM_RULES] -c chronoconfig.yaml [FLAGS]\n\nReplace the following:\n\nALERTMANAGER_CONFIG: The file containing your Prometheus Alertmanager configuration.\n\nPROM_RULES: The file containing your Prometheus rules.\n\nFLAGS: Any flags to include with the command. Run chronoctl sync prometheus --help to display supported flags.\n\nAdditional commands\n\nThese commands provide additional information as you use Chronoctl.\n\nhelp\n\nDisplays help text for the tool and any specified subcommand.\n\nversion\n\nDisplays the version, revision, build date, and Go version for Chronoctl. Provide this information when reporting an issue with Chronoctl to Chronosphere Support.\n\nCommand autocompletion\n\nYou can add support for shell command autocompletion with Chronoctl for the Bash, Zsh, Fish, and PowerShell by using the chronoctl completion command.\n\nThis section provides detailed steps for Bash and Zsh on macOS.

From my unsophisticated perspective, it appears that Grafana is the first mover in the space (meaning they were the first to raise VC funding and the are now valued the most (recently valued at $6 BN) vs Chronosphere which is now valued at $1 BN; however with the rapid growth of the market—is the market big enough for multiple players. And can companies like Grafana grow beyond the niche confines of the observability market? Can larger companies like Elastic displace smaller companies or are they complementary?\n\nBeyond these high level questions—how are these companies to work with? Are they easy to work with and put the customer first? How aggressive are they in moving customers to paying for premium services?\n\nAny thoughts and feedback are welcome and appreciated!!\n\n## Comment ID i3zp80t with +5 score by [(raptorjesus69, Reddit, 2022-04-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/grafana/comments/tzdvak/grafana_vs_chronosphere_vs_cribl/i3zp80t/) (in reply to ID tzdvak):\nThe other thing that sets grafana apart from the other two is grafana contributes much more to open source then the other companies. Grafana open sources there whole frontend along with all their databases. The only closed source parts of Grafanas observability tools are done plugins. That is what I think sets them a part from other observability vendors\n\n## Comment ID i3z0whv with +2 score by [(SelfDestructSep2020, Reddit, 2022-04-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/grafana/comments/tzdvak/grafana_vs_chronosphere_vs_cribl/i3z0whv/) (in reply to ID tzdvak):\n> can companies like Grafana grow beyond the niche confines of the observability market\n\nWhy would they need to?

Cribl specializes in getting data into the platform of your choice while chronosphere and Grafana are data analytics engines with a lot of focus on metrics. Cribl and Grafana are all very easy to work with large free tiers. I don’t have a ton of experience working with Chronosphere. The demo looks good, but their focus is too narrow for me. I don’t know if it has free tier. I want metrics and traces not just metrics. Grafana has some nice features but needs more analytics options and I would prefer options for security to use it as well. Cribl is a great option to scale your staff and gather pretty much any data for your analytics backends you can route your data anywhere and are not limited by your vendors at all. If you want to use one agent and route the same event to Grafana/ELK and Splunk for different use cases not a problem. Makes it all very easy and you can shape your data anyway you want. From an architecture POV I like decoupling data collection/management from your analytics platforms. Makes it easy to use whatever data platform you want and not feel stuck.  Cribl supports any data use case so operations/o11y/security use cases are no problem.",
      "# Post ID sgzjx4: [2022 in RoguelikeDev] Enter the Chronosphere with +24 score by [(EffortStar, Reddit, 2022-01-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/sgzjx4/2022_in_roguelikedev_enter_the_chronosphere/)\n# Enter the Chronosphere\n\n[Gameplay video](https://youtu.be/wAa__tuJ2VY)\n\n\n*Enter the Chronosphere* is a tactical bullet hell roguelike where each turn is a slice of real time action. You are an interdimensional soldier tasked with fighting through and disabling uncharted Chronospheres: Colossal, world-eating, reality-warping structures whose floors each reflect a major event in an alien history. Each sphere is unique, containing new environments, enemies, artifacts, weapons and mechanics.\n\nOver the course of many runs, you assemble a crew of misfits and rogues who each have their own reasons for taking on the seemingly impossible task of protecting the universe and finding a way to destroy the Chronospheres for good.\n\nOur design came from asking the question ‘what happens if we take a traditional roguelike off the grid?’ Chronosphere replaces ascii with icons, and square rooms with circles and curves. Instead of moving from tile to tile, you step a fixed distance in any direction.\n\nIt plays somewhere between Superhot and a tactical shooter. You can check out the jam version [here](https://rhys-vdw.itch.io/enter-the-chronosphere), which shows off the core action system, 13 floors, a boss, and fairly hefty pool of weapons. Very limited progression (just picking up stronger weapons on higher floors) but that’s going to change!\n\n\n## 2021 retrospective\n\nWe made the above version of Chronosphere for 7DRL and it was really well received, so we decided to expand the idea into a full game. We had to finish the project we were working on first ([Negative Nancy](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1276750/Negative_Nancy/), very much not a roguelike) which we did, and then formed our new company Effort Star. We’ll be working on Chronosphere full time this year which we are extremely excited about!\n\n\n## What’s new in 2022\n\nThis is going to be a huge year for us, and we’ll be aiming to have a build ready for steam by the end of it. The next three months are getting a vertical slice together, but here are some major goals for us.\n\n- **Finding an art style that will work**\n  While we really like the symbolic style we currently have, we think we could probably reach a lot more players with a hybrid sprites / 3d environment approach. Rhys and I are a programmer and designer respectively, so we’re currently looking for artists to work with.\n\n- **Wildly different themed dimensions**\n  The titular Chronosphere is an excuse for us to create wildly varied enemies, environments and weapons. Medieval sieges, dieselpunk dwarves, cyberpunk, gothic horror… with the core action system this flexible not much is off the table and we’d like to get weird. Every run of the game should feel like a love letter to the genre we’re drawing from.\n\n- **More dynamic level generation**\n  The current level generation is very simple, and we’re looking to do some more interesting things with obstacles, single floor goals (almost like implicit quests), destructible props and secrets. It’s important to get this right, as we want all the different dimensions to require different tactics and have a very different feel to play through.\n\n- **Building a compelling run progression**\n  Currently the game has no real run progression to speak of (I have more powerful weapons appearing on later floors, but that’s a band aid solution to the issue). We’re looking at giving players the ability to blend and mash up the active dimension of their runs halfway through (cowboys on velociraptors anybody?), and I’d like this to open up some interesting strategic choices. Actually this whole thing is probably just an excuse for me to fight a SWAT team with an enchanted axe and shield.\n\nWe’ll be having most of our development discussions publicly on discord, so anyone who’s interested in roguelike dev can follow along. Keen to connect with some other roguelike devs too, so we’ll probably be hanging out more here.\n\nSee you around!\n\n[itch.io](https://rhys-vdw.itch.io/enter-the-chronosphere) | [twitter](https://twitter.com/effortstargames) | [web](https://effortstar.com/) | [discord](https://discord.gg/guCYG8567Q)\n\n## Comment ID huzi0t8 with +3 score by [(Kyzrati, Reddit, 2022-01-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/sgzjx4/2022_in_roguelikedev_enter_the_chronosphere/huzi0t8/) (in reply to ID sgzjx4):\nWith as much fun as I already had with this back during 7DRL, would very much like to see progress updates in this in Sharing Saturday, that's for sure :)\n\n### Comment ID hv04o6m with +2 score by [(EffortStar, Reddit, 2022-01-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/sgzjx4/2022_in_roguelikedev_enter_the_chronosphere/hv04o6m/) (in reply to ID huzi0t8):\nThanks, Josh.

We found that datadog is still actually fairly affordable all things considered. When you factor the amount of time we would spend maintaining the stack internally, or compare to the costs of other fully supported third party services with similar feature sets, it ended up being a sort of wash.\n\nIn the end we still use datadog because it doesn't cost disproportionately higher than the other options and because it provides a single pane of glass for all kinds of engineers across all parts of the BU (network folks, security folks, kubernetes folks, vcenter folks, DBAs, data analysts)\n\n### Comment ID jtqnxfy with +3 score by [(cryonine, Reddit, 2023-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/15b1057/datadog_costs_that_high/jtqnxfy/) (in reply to ID jtnqoys):\nAgree with this take. The biggest thing with Datadog is having a good framework around what metrics you bring in and training engineers on how to properly leverage metrics. In our old self-hosted system we brought in tons and tons of metrics that literally no one used and had questionable value. When we brought those apps into Datadog we figured out what we did and didn’t need based on what engineers looked at, figured out if they actually make sense, and helped people implement them.\n\nEventually we had a squad that was tasked to build a custom module that wrapped the DD logger. This had various safeguards and best practices we developed internally to act as guardrails. At the end of the day the cost was more than manageable and the data was meaningful.\n\nSimilar things with logging and tracing. We took in all traces, but we rarely retained any because it wasn’t necessary. Logs were indexed only if they were security-related and the rest were dumped to S3. We had ways for engineers to watch real-time logs elsewhere.\n\nDD costs are often times only astronomical if your organization doesn’t take the time to create meaningful metrics.

Companies like Chronosphere ([https://chronosphere.io/](https://chronosphere.io/)) allow for granular controls on what is getting ingressed, what is getting stored as well looking at overall usage to understand patterns to optimize.

One the really big problems with telemetry is as your org gets larger its starts to become extremely difficult manage over usage. Teams will not prioritize metrics/log clean up or worse they will assign it to the junior/bottom engineer. I spent months fighting with teams at a large retail company to get metrics and logs under control. This only really got fixed when we had to eat a 6 figure overage charge, though in that case a lot of teams just gutted there logs/metrics as they would rather fly blind than actually manage their integrations.   \n\n\nI led 2 massive telemetry migrations at that same company and what I learned is most engineers have not idea how logs/metrics/traces work at even a basic level. Teams will again try and assign the junior or bottom engineer to this work causing more problems.

All animations looks ended in between \"turns\" so character fast moving and then immediately absolutely stable and still.

Been using datadog for the past year and hate it. The engineering resources needed to support DD have been pretty crazy just to get parity with new relic. The pricing is sneaky, you’ll think DD is cheaper but when you start adding on integrations and custom metrics and tags it becomes a nightmare. Also dd is severely lacking in its ability to write ad hoc queries for data. To be quite honest i think if i switch jobs again in the future i will avoid companies that rely on DD, thats how strongly i feel after using it for a year.

I haven't really got a chance to use it but I don't really hear bad things about it ever. My company is starting with Datadog very soon but has good feedback for our environment in comparison to New Relic during the POCs. The environment for us falls nicely in with DD's pricing and features (not very much dev work going on and many OOB solutions) so Dyna was significantly more expensive in our specific case. Like others have mentioned though, it can quickly catch up with Dynatrace which I would recommend really looking into in that case.

[gatling](https://gatling.io/) if you have (a monolith with) workflows and need more formalized code to *prove/audit* your testing.\n\nIn all cases, learn what you are really testing. In case of cloud we first test the ability to auto spin up more pods *before* the app goes into high load.  The second test is to turn this off and see what happens to the app instead when load surpasses 100%, which you end up testing the whole stack and its load/error handling capabilities. Its a must in the cloud, there are so many hidden performance settings you only know when you raise the load 10fold and wonder why their *internal routing* falls apart.

In my old project we wrote the load results into a database, so someone else could do reports on it. JMeter is a fine tool but it has more a technical view about the backend, while gatling is more formalized at the business side of things in my perspective.

I've included all the abilities that work as well as some that most people probably expect to work, but they don't.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Beastmaster; Roar - His ult pushes other enemies away from the target (not acutally sure why you would ever want that). This effect can push away out of chrono.\n* Centaur; Cart - Will pull you out of chrono. With Aether Lens you can get ppl out of the centre of the default chrono without getting frozen yourself.\n* Chaos Knight; Reality Rift - Allied CK can rift enemies in chrono and pull out them out of it.\n* Clock; Cogs - If a hero is on the edge of the chrono and clock is just outside of it, his cogs can drag reposition someone on the edge outside of chrono.\n* Earth Spirit; Boulder Smash - All heroes can be kicked out of chrono (they slide away pretty far). With enough cast range you can almost kick people on the other sied of chrono.\n* Earth Spirit; Geo Grip - Can't pull anyone out, unless they are turned into a Stone remnant with aghs.\n* Earthshaker; Fissure - Tricky one, but if placed correctly, it can get people out if they are on the very edge of chrono.\n* Elder Titan; Earth Splitter - Enemies on the edge of chrono can be pulled out with ET's ult.\n* Huskar; Inner Fire - With a shard, Inner fire can be cast during disable (including chrono), so if someone stands nearby, they can be pushed outside.\n* IO; Relocate - If you dont get stunned by getting pulled into chrono with tether, you will relo your ally out.\n* Kunkka; Tidal Wave - Kunkka's shard can push enemies out if aimed properly.\n* Magnus; Shockwave - Enemies on the edge of chrono will be pulled out of it.\n* Magnus; Skewer - If you manage to slide just along the tangent of chrono, you will drag enemies on the edge of it with you.\n* Magnus; Horn Toss - Can pull out enemies out of chrono.\n* Magnus; RP - Any enemies on the edge will be pulled towards the magnus and out chrono.\n* Marci; Dispose - Enemies and allies can be pulled out of chrono.\n* Marci; Rebound - With her shard she can throw allies into target location, so if an ally is on the very edge, you can get them out.\n* Mars; Spear - Can push out enemies out of chrono.\n* Mars; Arena - If placed on the edge of chrono so that both rings overlap, enemies will be pushed out by the soldiers/\n* Phoenix; Supernova - With his agha, allies can be pulled out of chrono.\n* Pudge; Hook - Can pull both enemies and allies out.\n* Pudge; Dismember - Can save allies by pulling them out with his agha.\n* Snapfire; Gobble Up - Her Aghs can save allies just like pudge's ult.\n* Spirit Breaker; Nether Strike - His ult (combined the bash) can push out enemies.\n* Tiny; Toss - Can get both allies and enemies out, depending on the cast range and if it has target ot the talent.\n* Tusk; Snowball - CAN'T pull allies in chrono into snowball.\n* Tusk; Kick - can kick out enemies out of chrono.\n* Arc Warden; Magnetic Field - With shard you can push out enemies.\n* Hoodwink; Bushwack - If a tree is nearby enemies on the edge of chrono will be pulled out.\n* Naga Siren; Reel in - Her new aghs WILL NOT pull out enemies.\n* Pango; Rolling thunder - If you blink into chrono while rolling you will push out enemis on the edge.\n* Sniper; Conc Grenade - His shard can be cast so that it pushes enemies away and out of chrono.\n* Sniper; Headshot - Headshot pushes enemies in chorno, so at the right angle you can push them out of it.\n* Venge; Swap - Proabably the most popular way to deal with chorno. Can \"save\" both enemies and allies.\n* Weaver; Time Lapse - If timed correctly you can reverse allies out of chrono with his agha.\n* Batrider; Flamebreak - Will push out enemies.\n* Batride; Lasso - His Ult WON'T drag enemies out of chrono.\n* Dark Seer; Vacuum - Will pull enemies out of chrono.\n* Distruptor; Glimpse - If timed correctly, it will reposition enemies, just like Time Lapse.\n* Engima; Black Hole - Will pull enemies out chrono. With agha there is technially a moment when you are out of chorno and not stunned by BH so you can escape.\n* KOTL; Blinding Light - Will push enenmies out just like Flamebreak.\n* KOTL; Will-o-Wisp - WILL NOT drag enemies during chrono.\n* Lich; Gaze - WILL NOT pull enemies in chrono.\n* Natures Prophet; Sprout - Similar to cogs and fissure, it can push out heroes on the very edge.\n* OD; Astral - With the shard if cast on allies, they can suddnely move and walk out of chrono.\n* Puck; Waning Rift - Will push out enemies out of chrono with the agha upgrade.\n* QOP; Sonic Wave - Will move enemies in chrono so it can oush out enemies.\n* Rubick.

I would expect Telekinesis, snowball and Lasso to work.  \nTelekinesis is an odd one. THey way it behaves when combined with other stuns and disables is just unpredictable, other than it's going to be broken.  \nI think Snowball used to work on chrono (I remember Tusk being picked during TI to counter Void), but I believe it was changed so that the target ally has to \"make an action\" and \"accept\" the snowball invitation.

We set out to make a game that takes a traditional roguelike formula and removes the constraints of the ASCII grid (360 degree movement, curved walls, vector art instead of text characters) but retains the synchronous turn-based combat.\n\n# — 2022 Retrospective —\n\nWell it's been a wild year! Forgive me, it's going to be hard to keep this short.\n\n## 🦎Incorporation of Effort Star\n\nWe started the year with our new company [Effort Star](https://effortstar.games), ready to work full time on the game.\n\n## 💰Government grant\n\nWe applied for funding from our state games funding body, VicScreen. Our pitch included a plan to bring the game to early access with just Ned and myself working on it. Happily they liked the game, and we got enough to sustain ourselves for about a year (on an extremely restricted income).\n\n## 📺Rogue Jam\n\nAt the end of 2021 we had impulsively entered our game in \"Rogue Jam\", a Shark-Tank-style game pitching event hosted on IGN. Surprisingly we made the cut for the \"Huge Potential\" category. The judges included Reggie Fils-Aimé (ex-nintendo) and Peer Schneider (IGN founder). They both played and loved the game. We came in first place!\n\n[Watch the full episode on YouTube](https://youtube.com/watch?v=yy_HNDqmqBw&si=EnSIkaIECMiOmarE)\n\n## 👯Growing the team\n\nSo at this stage we were pretty confident that we had a good game on our hands. We decided that the limiting factor was its minimal art style. We needed actual art (not just simple icons from Noun Project).\n\nAmazingly at this time another games grant was announced—this time a federal body, Screen Australia. We leveraged our success with Rogue Jam to apply for more funding. This time we pitched a larger game with a bigger team. Again this went well for us, and the next few months were spent finding a team who could create the visuals of the game.\n\nThis is our full team!\n\n* Rhys (me/programmer/producer): [https://twitter.com/Rhys\\_vdw](https://twitter.com/Rhys_vdw)\n* Ned (designer/writer): [https://twitter.com/BoyWhoCriedGame](https://twitter.com/BoyWhoCriedGame)\n* Tess (art director): [https://twitter.com/tessamonash](https://twitter.com/tessamonash)\n* Tim (concept artist): [https://www.instagram.com/tim\\_goschnick/](https://www.instagram.com/tim_goschnick/)\n* Matt (tech artist): [https://twitter.com/MattDavisGames](https://twitter.com/MattDavisGames)\n* Angus (composer/audio producer): [https://twitter.com/Angus\\_MV\\_Arnold](https://twitter.com/Angus_MV_Arnold)\n\n## 🖼️ New art style\n\nAt this stage we've developed our art style, but haven't fully incorporated it into the game. We have a single level that showcases our new environment, character and enemy designs.\n\n[Video playthrough of the art showcase (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TT-_oF4CDr4)\n\n## ⚙️ New game content\n\nOkay, so what about the gameplay? Yeah we found time to work on that too (incredibly)!\n\n[Video playthrough of the game with new content (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYnqyBndAUc)\n\n**Items**\n\nYou can now pick up items that modify your behavior during a run (they're kind of like perks, but some have active abilities that can be used). Examples: \"Gain health every time you kill an enemy\", or \"the last bullet in your clip explodes\".\n\nFor a small team with one programmer, it's crucial that this can be done without modifying code. It's just not going to be possible to create the game if I need to be involved in the process. The solution was a logic graph editor so that Ned can build these out. This means I just need to make a new node every now and then, and he can compose them however he wishes.\n\n**Biomes**\n\nWe've two \"biomes\" to the game. Each biome contains unique weapons, items, enemies and environments. Each biome has a specific mechanical focus, and you move through several in a single run of the game, allowing you to combine items from different biomes in interesting ways.\n\n*Wild west:* Cowboys, ricochets, dynamite, reloading.\n\n*Mole mines:* Drills, explosives, burrowing enemies.\n\n# — 2023 Outlook —\n\n2023 is going to be huge for us. There's a lot to do, but more people to do it!\n\n## 🔫 More content\n\nBy the end of 2023 we plan to have added three more biomes to the game. You'll have to wait and see what they are, but they'll each have new enemies, items and weapons.\n\n## 👩‍🎤Playable characters\n\nAt the moment the game has only one character, but we're planning on having character selection. Each character will have an active and a passive ability that makes them feel very different to play.\n\n## 🌏Level generation\n\nThis one is huge. Our level generation at the moment is very basic (essentially what I built during 7DRL 2021). We have plans for forests, doors & keys, environmental hazards and a system that is generally more sophisticated in how it places things in the level.\n\n## 👿Bosses\n\nOur existing boss still needs 3D art, and we're also planning to add at least one more major boss to the game.\n\n## 🎨Art\n\nMore enemies, more animations, more weapon models, more VFX. Oh, and also the levels will need to actually generate with art. Currently they're still just vector lines.\n\n# — Links —\n\nWe share our latest build with our Discord community, so if you'd like to try it out come and join us!

I've rinse and re-used this stack with about 20 companies now.  Pure beauty.  You can setup alerting schedules and such in PagerDuty to do shifts.  You can enable devs to monitor and maintain things by inviting them into Slack and giving them access to Grafana/Kibana.\n\nGenerally on top of that above I CI/CD 99% of everything with either Gitlab or Github.

Wrote custom agents for telemetry collection. Custom pipeline to ship metrics to our tsdb and the UI layers on top to visualize stuff.

The show up on the other side. We use splunk but we’re thinking of writing our own implementation because cost for licensing is more expensive vs hiring to build it. \n\nWe use Java, Kafka, Trino, S3, EC2, Flink, Elasticsearch, PagerDuty and probably a bunch of other things I’m forgetting. \n\nJust our log volume is around 300TB a week.

Nothing comes close for H/A prom and the architecture between tempo, loki, and cortex are almost the same, which means you get a bit of efficiency gain when you are doing config across the stack. Cortex usage on grafana is effortless since they build for that stack, and you can have zero vendor lock-in going between self hosted and grafana cloud or amazon managed prom. \n\nThat sounded like an advertisement so here’s the bad parts:\n- the cortex memory footprint is much heavier than straight Prometheus since metrics are buffered in memory for 3h (default). It’s still cheaper for me due to s3 savings for infrequently accessed metrics. \n-  the cortex documentation borders on non existent except as a reference. It’s more like an api reference than an operations guide. \n- some bits of the stack like tempo are really early in their development, if you stack them against established apm products it’s far behind. It’s very promising though. They will outpace jaeger pretty quickly at least. \n\nA footnote that Prometheus is heavily dependent on a service discovery mechanism so if you have no service catalog or you aren’t using kubernetes then you will have to BYO catalog of things to monitor, versus the agent based approach of other systems where installing an agent just adds the host.\n\n### Comment ID hus17vl with +1 score by [(SuperQue, Reddit, 2022-01-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/sevtqs/whats_your_monitoring_stack/hus17vl/) (in reply to ID huonojq):\nYea, we had a Cortex cluster for doing some centralized data.

When we merged with a much larger competitor, who happened to be living in the stone age as far as, well, pretty much everything on the tech side, we decided we'd try to use New Relic in a much more thorough way. We're currently working on centralizing logging and getting instrumentation on some CLI services, and APM is managing over 100 VMs nowadays. \n\n\nIt's absolutely remarkable how much NR can tie together. They have pretty solid APIs for pretty much everything, profiling tools, top notch documentation, and pretty active support of their products (bug fixes, etc.). They did recently change their pricing dimensions, which fucked us a bit, but it's genuinely worth it.\n\n## Comment ID huo5jdc with +1 score by [(russianguy, Reddit, 2022-01-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/sevtqs/whats_your_monitoring_stack/huo5jdc/) (in reply to ID sevtqs):\nOpenstack private cloud here:\n\n* fluentd, elasticsearch for logs\n* telegraf, prometheus for metrics\n* grafana, kibana for visualization\n* auditbeat for file integrity monitoring\n* pagerduty and slack for pings\n\n## Comment ID hum792n with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-01-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/sevtqs/whats_your_monitoring_stack/hum792n/) (in reply to ID sevtqs):\nWe use chronosphere to do the scraping/alerting for prometheus style metrics that goto opsgenie.\n\n## Comment ID humffe1 with +1 score by [(engineered_academic, Reddit, 2022-01-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/sevtqs/whats_your_monitoring_stack/humffe1/) (in reply to ID sevtqs):\nOur monitoring is kind of a mess across the organization, and we're trying to standardize it.\n\nSplunk for log aggergation (security & compliance) but ELK for metrics with OpenTelemetry Tracing and custom dashboards.\n\nWe also have legacy monitoring on our HW that I'm trying to drag into the modern age so that it can integrate with our modern cloud monitoring stack.\n\n## Comment ID hun0niq with +1 score by [(waaayfar3r, Reddit, 2022-01-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/sevtqs/whats_your_monitoring_stack/hun0niq/) (in reply to ID sevtqs):\nVictoriaMetrics as the core\nTelegraf for monitoring VMs\nPrometheus (kube-prometheus-stack) for scraping and remotewriting metrics from Kubernetes to VictoriaMetrics\nGrafana for dashboards and alerts\nOpsGenie for paging\n\nAlso:\nELK for logging\nSentry for error tracing\n\n\n\n\n\n## Comment ID humm000 with +1 score by [(placid8246, Reddit, 2022-01-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/sevtqs/whats_your_monitoring_stack/humm000/) (in reply to ID sevtqs):\nSystem: Netdata\nApps logs: Sentry\nAlerts: Slack\n\"Services goes down\" activation: Monit\n\n## Comment ID humtbfa with +1 score by [(jcoelho93, Reddit, 2022-01-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/sevtqs/whats_your_monitoring_stack/humtbfa/) (in reply to ID sevtqs):\nTIG, telegraf, influxdb and grafana.\nI setup a serverless telegraf to regularly check the status of some applications.\n\n## Comment ID humu0ug with +1 score by [(fluid_numerics, Reddit, 2022-01-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/sevtqs/whats_your_monitoring_stack/humu0ug/) (in reply to ID sevtqs):\nWith what you can do to configure fluent you can pipe most logging operations and visualization to cloud resources.

Even at this fast pace, the company really enforces work-life balance by encouraging employees to take time off, not work weekends, and half day Fridays all summer. They really care about the mental and physical health of their employees.\n\nI highly recommend Chronosphere!",

      "# [Chronosphere Acquires Calyptia, Creators of Leading Observability Pipeline Solutions on 2024-01-22](https://chronosphere.io/news/chronosphere-acquires-calyptia/)\nCompany to Integrate Calyptia’s Capabilities with its Observability Platform while Continuing Support of Open Source Projects\n\nNEW YORK – January 22, 2024 – Chronosphere, the leading cloud native observability platform, announced that it has acquired Calyptia, a leading provider of observability pipeline solutions. Chronosphere will integrate Calyptia’s core technology, which provides log transformation and optimization capabilities, into the company’s cloud native observability platform.\n\nCalyptia is founded by the original creators of the Fluent Ecosystem, which includes the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) graduated projects Fluent Bit and Fluentd. The vendor-agnostic Fluent projects are lightweight and highly scalable log processors. They allow organizations to collect telemetry from multiple sources and distribute them to any defined destination. With more than 12 billion downloads, Fluent Bit is the preferred logging processor for cloud native environments. As part of its ongoing commitment to open source, Chronosphere will continue to invest in the Fluent projects and community.\n\nCalyptia’s observability pipeline product is built on top of Fluent Bit. The addition of this pipeline to Chronosphere’s platform enables the routing, transformation, and optimization of log data at scale. With these new capabilities, teams have a central interface to:\n\nControl costs at the source by not having to send the data they don’t need. Intelligent built-in filters can reduce volumes by 30% or more.\n\nProvide additional context by enriching data or improve security by redacting data – all in flight, before the data is stored at its destination.\n\nAnalyze log data in realtime while it’s being collected instead of waiting for it to be stored and indexed, allowing developers to quickly debug production impacting issues.\n\nChronosphere also recently announced its new log storage and visualization functionality, Logs powered by Crowdstrike. With both announcements, Chronosphere customers now have end-to-end logging capabilities in addition to the rest of the observability platform.\n\n“With observability data growing by orders of magnitude, companies are ill-equipped to manage the costs and scale of this deluge, forcing their teams to make trade-offs. Teams are especially challenged to handle log data which is prohibitively expensive to move and store,” said Martin Mao, CEO and Co-Founder, Chronosphere. “With the addition of Calyptia’s leading observability pipeline solution, we’re taking an important step to ensure that developers have the ultimate control over all their observability data from end to end—including log files to control cost and improve developer productivity.”\n\n“We are excited to join the Chronosphere team, which shares our passion and history of innovation in helping companies transform their approach to observability,” said Eduardo Silva, Founder, Calyptia. “We look forward to combining our solutions to make observability even more effective and more cost efficient, for any type of company and every telemetry data type. We’re excited to continue building and supporting the Fluent Ecosystem as an open source and vendor neutral solution.”\n\n“Calyptia joining the Chronosphere team is excellent news for everyone who is invested in the future of open source cloud native technology,” said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). “In today’s world, anyone that doesn’t adopt open source technology risks being left behind. I’m excited to see how the Fluentd and Fluent Bit projects will continue to grow and evolve as more end users embrace the capabilities of cloud native observability.”\n\nAdditional Resources:",
      "# [Calyptia Buy Completes Chronosphere Observability Trinity by Joab Jackson, Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols, Martin Visser, Heather Joslyn, Richard MacManus, Loraine Lawson, Apu Pavithran, Tobi Knaup, B. Cameron Gain, Susan Hall on 2024-01-31](https://thenewstack.io/chronospheres-calyptia-buy-completes-observability-trinity/)\nWith its acquisition of Calyptia earlier this month, Chronosphere will have competitive components for all three of the required pillars of a full-fledged observability platform: metrics, traces, and now logs.\n\nCalyptia was built around the open source Fluentd and the associated FluentBit pipeline, two unified logging projects of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. They have become a de facto part of many cloud native stacks, including those run by Oracle, IBM, Microsoft, AWS, and Google.\n\nIn addition to Calyptia’s expertise around the Fluent bits, what made Calyptia appealing was how nicely it fit with Chronosphere’s core values of keeping data costs low for users, said Martin Mao, CEO and co-founder of Chronosphere, in an interview with TNS.\n\n“We’ve historically done that very well on the metric side, and on the tracing side,” Mao explained. “We give you visibility into the explosion of data into what’s causing it and how to fix these things. So it’s not just having these things, but it’s actually having having them cost reliably.”\n\nThe approach is certainly a differentiator when compared to a Chronosphere rival, DataDog, which has been criticized for high customer bills.\n\n(Also to keep observability costs manageable, Chronosphere also recently partnered with Crowdstrike to provide data storage for the Chronosphere platform.)\n\nCalyptia fits into this value proposition comfortably, Mao said. Calyptia had a sharp focus on serving the enterprise, “building out the core pipeline product for the top end of the market,” he said.\n\nThe Three Pillars of Observability\n\nIn the past few years, what used to be known as monitoring has evolved into observability, which offers more tools to understand performance and help in troubleshooting. Observability is usually covered by three components: metrics, tracing and logging.\n\n“Historically, there have been different solutions, and people piece it together themselves, but the industry is moving towards consolidation in a single platform,” Mao said.\n\nChronosphere plans to incorporate Calyptia’s log transformation and optimization capabilities into the company’s own platform.\n\n“With Calyptia, telemetry can be automatically routed to a best-in-class observability solution (such as Chronosphere) for monitoring, to a SIEM platform that helps maintain your security posture, and to integrate disparate systems in cloud native environments,” wrote Eduardo Silva, founder and Fluentd core contributor of Calyptia, and creator of Fluentd, in a blog post.\n\nWhat Is Fluentd?\n\nThe Fluentd is a highly scalable open source log processor, allowing users to collect telemetry from multiple sources and distribute them to analysis and monitoring systems.\n\nBuilt on top of FluentBit is Calyptia’s observability pipeline, enabling the routing, transformation, and optimization of log data at scale. Users can add filters to reduce the amount of data being transferred. Data can also be enriched or redacted, and even analyzed in real time.\n\nThus far, FluentBit has been downloaded 12 billion times. Chronosphere pledges to invest in Fluent projects and community, Mao said.\n\n“Calyptia joining the Chronosphere team is excellent news for everyone who is invested in the future of open source cloud native technology,” said Chris Aniszczyk, CNCF CTO, in a statement on Chronosphere’s blog post.",
      "# [Chronosphere Accelerates Revenue Growth and Global Customer Success with New Executive Leadership and Programs on 2024-05-07](https://chronosphere.io/news/chronosphere-accelerates-growth-new-executive-leadership/)\nNew York, May 7, 2024 — Observability innovator, Chronosphere, today announced strategic leadership moves to accelerate the company’s go-to-market initiatives, global scale, and customer support. Margaret Dawson joins the company as Global Head of Marketing and Bill Hineline is the new Field Chief Technology Officer. These moves come as Chronosphere continues to build out its full-stack observability platform following the acquisition of Calyptia earlier this year and increased investments in its European operations and partner alliances.\n\n“Both Margaret and Bill bring a wealth of experience helping customers increase the value and performance of critical technology platforms and innovations, and we are thrilled to have them on the team as our customers work to update their approach to observability and monitoring,” said Martin Mao, CEO of Chronosphere. “Their experience crafting customer and data-driven go-to-market strategies, as well as managing teams, will further propel our growth and adoption.\n\nA proven marketing and technology executive, Dawson brings more than 25 years of experience at early-stage startups and Fortune 500 companies. Most recently, she was Vice President of Portfolio Strategy and Chief of Staff to the CEO at Apptio, the leading technology spend and value management company, which IBM acquired in 2023. Prior to joining Apptio, she spent seven years at Red Hat, the leading provider of enterprise open source solutions. Ranked as one of the top Women in Cloud Computing, Dawson was named Business Role Model of the Year for Women in IT, and Mentor and Coach of the Year by the Stevie Business Awards.\n\nHineline joins Chronosphere after 17 years with United Airlines and brings a wealth of cross-functional expertise to his position. Over the last 24 years in the airline industry, he held a variety of leadership roles, ranging from IT operations and engineering to digital marketing. In his last role, he served as Director of Enterprise Observability for United Airlines. As Field CTO, Hineline will serve as a trusted advisor for Chronosphere customers. In his role, he will bridge the gap between business challenges and observability solutions by sharing real-world experience from a customer perspective.\n\nOther executives who will assume new and expanded roles include Ian Smith, who has been appointed Chief of Staff to the CEO and Head of Strategy, following four years as Field CTO and Solutions Engineering lead. Current head of Solution Engineering, Seong Park, will now also lead the Customer Success Engineering and Technical Advisory Management (TAM) team with a promotion to Global Head of Customer Success and Solution Engineering. Prior to Chronosphere, Park led Customer Success organizations at Lacework and ThoughtSpot. Finally, Calyptia Co-Founder Anurag Gupta will become the company’s first Field Architect to help design and implement solutions across telemetry pipeline and observability for Chronosphere’s growing global customer base.",
      "# [Chronosphere Named a Leader in the 2024 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Observability Platforms on 2024-08-14](https://chronosphere.io/news/mq-leader-2024/)\nNEW YORK – August 14, 2024 – Chronosphere, the observability platform built for control, today announced it is named a Leader in the 2024 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Observability Platforms.

As with any private company, investors interested in Chronosphere should keep an eye on official announcements and financial reports for the most up-to-date information on the company's status and any potential plans to go public.\n\nHow to invest in Chronosphere\n\nWhile Chronosphere's IPO prospects remain uncertain, investors interested in the cloud-native observability space don't have to wait on the sidelines.

      "# [twisting roguelike that blends action and tactics by Mike Holmes on 2024-03-19](https://rogueliker.com/enter-the-chronosphere-trailer/)\nI was trawling through the usual selection of press releases from today and I found one potential gem that I wanted to sign post for you all, and that’s Enter the Chronosphere.\n\nNot only does the game have a wicked-cool name, but it looks like an absolute trip – in a good way, of course. Nobody likes a bad trip…\n\nThe game has only recently resurfaced, now with a Steam page, and so I grabbed the trailer that developer Effort Star (and publisher Joystick Ventures) have prepared for the game’s upcoming appearance at PAX East.\n\nI’m not going to the event which makes the PAX bit rather irrelevant to me, however, its intriguing blend of mechanics does have my attention – and who doesn’t love a good trailer!\n\nWhat is Enter the Chronosphere?\n\nAccording to the devs, their game offers a mixture of turn-based tactics and real-time action. Players will be able to play at their own pace “alternating between bold action and careful planning.” It looks like you’ll be able to move around and act quickly, but then slow things down when you need to think.\n\nIt sounds like crafting “wild combinations of weapons, items, and character abilities” is going to be central to the experience, as players traverse a variety of strange, labyrinthine biomes and battle the enemies that they find within.\n\nSo what is a “chronosphere” I here you ask? Well, Dear Reader, according to Effort Star – and they should know – it’s a huge structure that consumes time and twists reality. Apparently, the “deeper you go, the weirder it gets” – which only makes me want to visit one more!\n\nInside these chronospheres we’ll meet all manner of strange enemies, however, we’ll also able to take things from one world to another. That means that we can combine the gear that we find along the way (the Steam page includes examples such as “revolvers and radguns, spears and sniper rifles, wakizashis and wasps”).\n\nWe’ll be in control of a “crew of misfits” – which sounds like they’ll be quite personable. By completing missions we’ll be able to unlock new abilities for them, as well as “game modes, threats and secrets.”\n\nWhen can one enter their own chronosphere?\n\nThere’s no release date at the time of writing, but I’ve wishlisted it and will report back as and when there are any developments.\n\nIf you can’t wait to get your hands on the game, of course you could head over to PAX East, but if you’re like me and that’s not feasible, you could always play an earlier version of the game.\n\nEnter the Chronosphere started life during 7DRL Challenge 2021, and there’s a playable version of an earlier prototype over on Itch.io.",
