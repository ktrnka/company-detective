      "# [OpenHands + Daytona](https://openhands.daytona.io/infrastructure)\nImagine you're using an AI coding assistant like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, or Cody, which suggests code improvements while you work. While these tools are powerful, they face significant limitations: they often only operate within single files and lack access to your full development environment. This limits their ability to fully understand and simulate your project’s behavior. Even when tools like Cursor introduce features such as \"shadow workspaces,\" the AI still doesn’t have full access to a dynamic, comprehensive environment to test and iterate safely without disrupting your work.\n\nNow, picture a game-changing solution: Agent-Agnostic Infrastructure Middleware. This type of middleware acts as a robust, cloud-based system that dynamically creates isolated workspaces—or sandboxes—for AI agents to operate in. Think of it as the multiverse from MCU movies, where each new change spins off into its own timeline, in this case, a sandbox. This setup lets the AI run experiments, explore solutions, and iterate independently across countless sandboxes without impacting your main project. When one pathway proves valuable, the AI can integrate those tested solutions back into your code seamlessly.\n\nMost AI coding agents today face two main constraints:\n\nLimited Context\n\nThey only operate within open files or indexed codebases but can’t simulate runtime behavior or project-level dependencies fully.\n\nExperiment Interference: If they try to test code changes, it could conflict with your current work.\n\nThe Future Vision\n\nAn AI coding agent capable of spinning up and managing parallel workspaces as needed. This capability means the AI can explore, test, and optimize multiple solutions in real time. Once an optimal solution is found, it’s provided back to you, the developer, fully tested and ready to use. This innovation turns coding agents from file-focused assistants into fully capable partners that can independently analyze and solve complex problems without you needing to sift through trial-and-error processes.\n\nWhile traditional cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, or DigitalOcean could technically manage these sandboxes, the cost and DevOps workload would be overwhelming. Agent-agnostic middleware solves this by offering automated, efficient resource management: it spins up multiple sandboxes when needed and shuts them down as soon as they're no longer useful. This way, even if an AI agent spins up 100 parallel workspaces, the cost and compute usage can be kept as efficient as one machine running for an hour or two.\n\nWe’ve begun to connect open-source AI coding agents to Daytona as a proof of concept and are actively seeking input from other innovators in the space. Whether you’re building an AI agent or are interested in collaborating on developing industry-wide standards for this middleware, we’d love to hear from you.\n\nIf this vision resonates with you, reach out at here.",

      "# [AI Agents](https://www.daytona.io/definitions/a/ai-agents)\nAI agents are autonomous or semi-autonomous software systems that combine artificial intelligence algorithms, knowledge bases, and decision-making capabilities to perceive their environment, reason about objectives, and execute purposeful actions to achieve defined goals.\n\nThese agents can operate in both digital and physical spaces, leveraging capabilities like environment perception, strategic planning, tool utilization, adaptive learning, and memory management.\n\nCategories of AI Agents\n\n1. Autonomous Agents\n\nFunction independently with minimal human oversight\n\nIt can be generalist (handling various tasks) or specialized (domain-specific)\n\nMake decisions and execute actions independently\n\n2. Semi-autonomous Agents\n\nOperate with periodic human input or verification\n\nCan be generalist or specialized\n\nBalance automated operation with human oversight\n\n3. Assistive Agents\n\nWork alongside humans as collaborative partners\n\nCan be generalist or specialized\n\nAugment human capabilities rather than replace them\n\nSpecialization Examples in Development\n\nSpecialized AI agents can focus on specific development tasks such as:\n\nCode review and PR analysis\n\nTest generation and validation\n\nCode documentation and commenting\n\nSecurity vulnerability scanning\n\nPerformance optimization\n\nCode refactoring suggestions\n\nDependency management\n\nBuild process optimization\n\nDevelopment Environment Integration\n\nIn modern development environments, AI agents can seamlessly integrate with existing tools and workflows to enhance developer productivity. They can operate within IDEs, version control systems, and CI/CD pipelines, providing intelligent assistance throughout the development lifecycle.\n\nThe AI Enablement Stack provides a structured framework for effectively implementing these agents. This architecture spans foundational infrastructure through core AI capabilities to end-user agents, helping organizations build production-ready AI implementations using validated, enterprise-grade solutions.\n\nIntegration Capabilities\n\nInteract with source code repositories and version control systems\n\nIntegrate with popular IDEs and development tools\n\nAnalyze code changes and provide real-time feedback\n\nAssist in debugging and problem-solving\n\nAutomate routine development tasks\n\nEnhance code quality and maintainability\n\nSupport collaborative development practices\n\nOptimize development workflows and processes\n\nEach type of agent, whether generalist or specialized, employs AI techniques to persistently pursue objectives while adapting to changing conditions in their operational environment. This ultimately improves the efficiency and quality of software development.\n\nSecurity Through Sandboxing\n\nImplementing robust sandboxing mechanisms for AI agents is crucial for maintaining security and control in development environments. Sandboxing ensures that agents operate within well-defined boundaries, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive systems or data. This controlled environment allows agents to execute tasks while protecting against potential vulnerabilities, unintended behaviors, or malicious exploitation. Organizations should implement multiple layers of security controls, including access limitations, resource constraints, and continuous monitoring of agent activities.",
      "# [API (Application Programming Interface)](https://www.daytona.io/definitions/a/api-application-programming-interface)\nA set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other.\n\nDefinition\n\nAn API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other .It specifies how software components should interact, making it easier for developers to integrate and extend functionality across different systems and services.\n\nContext and Usage\n\nAPIs enable software interoperability and are crucial in web, mobile, and third-party integrations. Examples like REST, GraphQL, and SOAP facilitate tasks such as retrieving weather data and managing authentication.

      "# [Automated Provisioning](https://www.daytona.io/definitions/a/automated-provisioning)\nAutomated Provisioning refers to the streamlined process of automatically creating and configuring computing resources, such as servers, virtual machines, or containers, without the need for manual intervention. This method ensures efficient scaling and management of resources, eliminating the potential errors and time constraints associated with manual provisioning. Automated provisioning enables developers and IT teams to quickly and consistently provision the necessary infrastructure, removing the dependence on individual developer's machines or manual setups. By automating the provisioning process, organizations can minimize configuration inconsistencies, enhance collaboration, and accelerate software development and deployment workflows. Through the use of standardized development environments (SDEs) and automation tools, such as infrastructure-as-code and containerization technologies, automated provisioning brings consistency, speed, and scalability to the creation and management of computing resources, contributing to the overall efficiency and productivity of software development processes.",
      "# [Bash Script](https://www.daytona.io/definitions/b/bash-script)\nA bash script is a plain text file containing a sequence of commands for the Bash shell, a command-line interpreter included in many Unix-based systems. These scripts typically have a `.sh` extension and are used to automate tasks by running multiple commands in a sequence, simplifying repetitive actions or complex workflows. Bash scripts can encompass a variety of commands, from simple file operations to complex logic involving loops, conditionals, and variable manipulations.\n\nIn the context of setting up a remote development environment, a bash script can be immensely valuable. For instance, when provisioning a Linux server for development purposes, you might use a bash script to sequentially execute commands to install necessary software like Docker, set up SSH keys for secure connections, and configure security settings. This automation minimizes manual errors and saves time, making the onboarding process smoother, especially when dealing with environments on different machines. With Daytona, you can bring your own dotfiles, including bash scripts, to customize your environment to your liking.",
      "# [Browser-Based Development Environment](https://www.daytona.io/definitions/b/browser-based-development-environment)\nA Browser-Based Development Environment is a subset of cloud development environments that allows developers to access and manage their development workspace through a web browser interface. These environments are designed to streamline the development process by providing on-demand, pre-configured setups that can be instantly spun up, enabling developers to quickly switch between projects and languages, and collaborate in real-time with team members. As part of the broader spectrum of Development Environment Management (DEM), these browser-based setups offer flexibility, scalability, and improved cost efficiency by utilizing pooled cloud resources.",
      "# [agnostic](https://www.daytona.io/definitions/c/cloud-agnostic)\nCloud-agnostic refers to the ability of a software application, development environment, or service to operate seamlessly across different cloud service providers without being locked into a single provider's ecosystem. In the context of Cloud Integrated Development Environments (Cloud IDEs), a cloud-agnostic IDE offers developers the flexibility to code, debug, and deploy software across various cloud environments (such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), ensuring consistent tooling, configurations, and workflows. This adaptability is particularly beneficial for maintaining standardized development environments, enabling easy integration and transition between local and cloud-based development setups.",

Spa would be second\n\n\\- I own the Mercedes and the LMP2. I've put more laps in practice on the Mercedes. But I'm happy to drive whatever the team drives and will learn the car quickly.\n\n\\- I am available every night (except Wednesday) this week for some team practice.\n\n\\- I will not be the fastest driver but I will do my best to keep all four wheels on the pavement.

I really enjoy racing against them with most combinations.  For me, it's better than online racing in general--it feels more like real racing.  Some things to keep in mind:\n\nAlways use static, default conditions.  Race at noon or afternoon under sunny or partly cloudy skies with a temperature of 78F.  The AI get a big turbo boost when it's cool.\n\nSome cars do have sucky AI.  Super Formula Lights and the SR 10 are in this category.\n\nThey can be slow on cold tires on road courses.\n\nNASCAR at Daytona and Talladega aren't great.\n\nThere were a number of bugs that got introduced with the S2 release that have yet to be fixed.\n\nI guess most of those are negative comments, but that leaves 90% of the racing you want to do.\n\n### Comment ID l1wknh5 with +1 score by [(MrWillyP, Reddit, 2024-04-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/iRacing/comments/1cgi8mx/whats_the_ai_like_now/l1wknh5/) (in reply to ID l1wcuq9):\nI can't seem to get the ai to race how I'd like them to to be honest.

If I set the AI to 90% at one track I can wipe the floor with them, but at another track they could be getting literal grip hacks and setting times that are impossible. Lots of trial and error is needed to get them running at a suitable pace on a track by track basis.\n\n### Comment ID l1xjghl with +3 score by [(rungunseattacos, Reddit, 2024-04-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/iRacing/comments/1cgi8mx/whats_the_ai_like_now/l1xjghl/) (in reply to ID l1xf51q):\nYup, this is the biggest issue. In some tracks they can be at 30% and they absolutely fly. Like Sebring. At 30% they’re capable of doing 1:59.xx lap times. But on other tracks you can set em and 90% and they can’t even keep up with me. It’s weird.

In the MX-5, the AI skill settings made sense, with \"pro\" times matching those of top split 1 drivers on all tracks I've tried.  Now that I'm using the GR86 though, the AI skill settings make no sense on any track I've tried.  I just did an AI race at Oschersleben in the GR86 in dry conditions, and an AI skill setting of 60% had the fastest group of cars doing 2 seconds per lap better than the absolute best times seen in any real session.  Way faster than any real human can do with a skill setting of 60%?  How does that make sense?  If I want a representative race with AI, I have to keep adjusting the skill settings by trial and error until they get realistic times (not wildly slow or wildly fast) in qualifying.\n\n## Comment ID l1vxofx with +3 score by [(nasanu, Reddit, 2024-04-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/iRacing/comments/1cgi8mx/whats_the_ai_like_now/l1vxofx/) (in reply to ID 1cgi8mx):\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L\\_IGYNyj0Do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_IGYNyj0Do) You can see the racecraft, pace and collision avoidance there.\n\n## Comment ID l1vz6k0 with +2 score by [(gabiii_Kokeko, Reddit, 2024-04-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/iRacing/comments/1cgi8mx/whats_the_ai_like_now/l1vz6k0/) (in reply to ID 1cgi8mx):\nI saw some good ai overtakes but maybe that's because the ai range that I've on was very wide.

I watch every single qualified and race and it's like my own racing universe which all have custom names (taken from FM regens).\n\nIt's pretty good now. Barcelona, Fuji, and Road America probably the Top 3 tracks I have noticed on a constant basis. Rejoins are still not good but improves, wreck avoidance is much better and 90% of situations they avoid them. Snetteron is actually pretty good because of that back straight, had a wonder pass in that long right hander before the pit straight in my European MX5 Championship.\n\nBest cars? The Super Formula Lights is pretty good from racing perspective at Fuji, the Australiasia Super Formula B (the A is the top series... I'm getting carried away now) is about to enter the Australian Leg which has Phillip Island and Sandown.\n\nWillow Springs is pretty good aswell.\n\nKnockhill and some short courses like Motegi West and Oscheleben B Course, no passes at all.

It is possible I misspoke on that one because I was trying different setups. But I know I decided no spoiler on the Camaro in the end, so whatever the no rear spoiler downforce is what I went with. Does no rear spoiler allow adjustment? \n\nA lot of it is to taste as well, minor things won't matter once you get in the race. But f you notice a certain car type going too fast or too slow that's where you can go back and adjust either downforce or horsepower to \"correct\" their speeds. We're essentially doing custom BoP on the cars and there's more than one way to make it work.\n\n## Comment ID kxfgmpi with +34 score by [(furrynoy96, Reddit, 2024-03-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/granturismo/comments/1bse1qk/nascar_in_gt7/kxfgmpi/) (in reply to ID 1bse1qk):\nDue to NASCAR licensing, I hope that PD can make a fictional stock car based on the NASCAR stock car.

But by endurance, teamwork, and strategy. A perfect, timeless idea, which is then completely hammered into the dirt by constant meddling from our sanctioning body. Some painful but understandable, like the COT and other safety changes. Others mindbogglingly poor ideas. Like formatting our entire championship system around an elimination gimmick.

      "# Post ID 1hmurd0: I'm so tired of beating 19 cars from the back of the grid with +716 score by [(Foxxear, Reddit, 2024-12-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/granturismo/comments/1hmurd0/im_so_tired_of_beating_19_cars_from_the_back_of/)\nWe all know the AI in Gran Turismo isn't the best to race against, because they just lack good racecraft. But that aside, why does every race design have to be \"Defeat a huge conga line of slowpokes, starting from the back\"? Especially with how short these events are, it just seems completely backwards.\n\nWhy can't we start some of these 5-10 lap races from maybe 3rd or 4th on the grid, and work our way past a few *genuinely fast* drivers? You can keep the equivalent challenge level that way, but it would be nice to actually practice running behind/alongside your opponent, and finding a good opportunity to narrowly make a pass. This is how most racing against humans actually goes.\n\nThere's no time to set up sane passes on 19 cars to catch the leader in time to win, you end up needing to blow by them with insane maneuvers at every other corner. That can be fun at times (especially early game), but it's just not a very realistic daily racing scenario, it doesn't encourage good racecraft, and it's not something I think anyone wants to do every time. It is ironically a very \"Need For Speed\" type scenario. The AI doesn't make for good drivers to try risky moves on, either... they'll just ram you or spin you for interrupting their line, even when they arent on the limit... it's not great to have to pass 19 of these guys. If they're going to be so slow, I wish they were pushovers, too.\n\nAs a long time fan of the series, and even just a player of the newest entry, some scenario variation would be much appreciated. I think this series gets away with this stuff because it has so many incredible merits that you just dont get in one package anywhere else. And I really like Gran Turismo 7... but it's also been 20 years since Gran Turismo *4*.\n\nI feel like a lot of players, even those with immense racing skill, just end up ramming AI off the track (or using them as pinball bumpers for your car), just from being burnt out on the same silly scenario with weak implementation. When does it end\n\n**EDIT:** To everyone saying \"Just play online\" \"Just play Sport mode\" \"Just do Custom Race\" \"Just race Sophy\" etc., this would be a fine point if the game's singleplayer career weren't required to access all the cars, tracks, and tuning parts first. As it stands, you cannot *just* do the other content, so I'm saying I want the required content to be more fun & interesting than it currently is, via some *very simple* tweaks.\n\n**EDIT 2:** To everyone saying \"Just use a slower car to make the events harder\", my issue is not really with the *difficulty.* Right from the title, this post has been about the lack of *variety* in racing scenarios. There is a huge difference in the racing *experience* you get from passing 19 cars in a few laps vs. passing around 2-3 tough opponents in that same timeframe. Having faster opponent cars is only a means to an end here, not the entire goal.\n\n**EDIT 3:** To everyone saying \"They can't make the current AI drive fast enough to be a challenge\", I don't buy that, there are some late game driving missions where it seems plenty quick. Even if the AI were too limited in \"skill\", just give their cars more grip, power, traction control etc. until they can fight a driver at the desired level. The PP restrictions on players needn't apply to the opponents so long as the *result* is a fair and well constructed race scenario.\n\n## Comment ID m3wtdav with +498 score by [(TospLC, Reddit, 2024-12-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/granturismo/comments/1hmurd0/im_so_tired_of_beating_19_cars_from_the_back_of/m3wtdav/) (in reply to ID 1hmurd0):\nI want to do a qualifying lap, then place me in the field wherever that puts me.\n\n### Comment ID m3wtxgr with +158 score by [(Foxxear, Reddit, 2024-12-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/granturismo/comments/1hmurd0/im_so_tired_of_beating_19_cars_from_the_back_of/m3wtxgr/) (in reply to ID m3wtdav):\nI suspect they fear qualifying because many fast players would then find every *race* to be an empty tack day, with some other cars starting behind you.

I am also using a controller, so I have a bit of a handicap. I can't win the top formula races yet, so I guess for others, they might always start in the front. I still think, with one lap, it would be hard to post your best time. I know my fastest laps are a few laps in. I would imagine it is like that for others? But maybe I'm wrong. Maybe the pro wheel,\n users would get bored doing that, but maybe there could be an option to skip qualifying, and it just places you in the back, since you didn't post a time. In any event, I agree, there should be some system so I'm not always starting in the back, and getting boxed in by the terrible AI every time.\n\n#### Comment ID m3xhrc3 with +2 score by [(brash, Reddit, 2024-12-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/granturismo/comments/1hmurd0/im_so_tired_of_beating_19_cars_from_the_back_of/m3xhrc3/) (in reply to ID m3wtxgr):\nThat was my experience with the old GT games, I’d win the qualifying race every time and then start from the pole and never see another car for the whole race unless I was lapping someone. \n\nI do kind of prefer having to fight my way from last to first even if the competition isn’t fantastic.\n\n### Comment ID m3wyxyz with +23 score by [(bomber991, Reddit, 2024-12-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/granturismo/comments/1hmurd0/im_so_tired_of_beating_19_cars_from_the_back_of/m3wyxyz/) (in reply to ID m3wtdav):\nSame.

They could probably make races challenging with a preselected, pretuned car, but that defeats a lot of the purpose of collecting a lot of cars and tuning them yourself for your own driving preferences. The PP system is an attempt to let you have that freedom while still letting them tune races to be challenging, but it's incredibly exploitable, and in some cases nonsensical, since a race car with the same PP rating as a budget sedan is pretty much always going to beat it across the board.\n\n### Comment ID m3x8ow3 with +12 score by [(Foxxear, Reddit, 2024-12-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/granturismo/comments/1hmurd0/im_so_tired_of_beating_19_cars_from_the_back_of/m3x8ow3/) (in reply to ID m3x6lw9):\nShould just make it a street racing game with traffic\n\n### Comment ID m40gxxk with +1 score by [(Gandalf_2077, Reddit, 2024-12-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/granturismo/comments/1hmurd0/im_so_tired_of_beating_19_cars_from_the_back_of/m40gxxk/) (in reply to ID m3x6lw9):\nGT7 always felt more like a puzzle game.\n\n### Comment ID m43rto4 with +1 score by [(OldBay-Szn, Reddit, 2024-12-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/granturismo/comments/1hmurd0/im_so_tired_of_beating_19_cars_from_the_back_of/m43rto4/) (in reply to ID m3x6lw9):\nYea I don’t think I’ll get the next GT if it has the same race from the back racing again.

People sometimes say \"Ah these games aren't really about the AI races, its about multiplayer\" but the singeplayer career is immensely necessary to unlock the game's content. It would indeed be great if it focused on getting you in sync with good racecraft, as you obtain vehicles and resources to move into multiplayer with.\n\nImproved AI is the obvious fix, but like I said, even just starting further up the grid against faster cars would help things as-is. By starting players in the back, you are forced to create a scenario where every opponent is substantially slower, even if they werent dumb about racecraft. Real races rarely work this way. You need to be fastest, but only by a little bit, next to other quite fast drivers.\n\n## Comment ID m3x6yvk with +21 score by [(Proper-Scientist-153, Reddit, 2024-12-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/granturismo/comments/1hmurd0/im_so_tired_of_beating_19_cars_from_the_back_of/m3x6yvk/) (in reply to ID 1hmurd0):\nYeah mate.

I get bored of it very quickly and that's a massive shame because the franchise is a huge part of my youth. I was 17 when the first one came out and have fond memories of it - all of em actually - but when you think that they've hardly changed and improved gameplay and features in 27 years, and are just using the same old method, it's basically GT1 with updated graphics and cars. As I don't play online because that doesn't interest me, I want a 1 player mode that I can just sink into and waste hours of my days on it like I used to over the years. \n\nHow about some kind of story mode with your career progression. \n\nQualifying. \n\nSponsors. \n\nMedia work and interviews.\n\nDifferent types of mini games, not just mundane chasing and grinding for bronze, silver or gold trophies on licenses and missions. \n\n. \n\nIt's basically chase the rabbit over and over again.

Having a fast car does little to engagement if the driver or ai isn't capable of driving. \n\nCasuals want to thrash some ai and feel bad ass as they win a race. That's why the races are that way. Easy to over take easier to stay up front. Buuuut just enough of them to make it hard ish to get 1st place. It's actually more intricate than that. You can tell that the spacing and paces of cars is on purpose if fr you have a car with pp equal to that of a race suggestion. Then the ai will race you by keeping pace when your away and then park it on the apex making it hard for you to drive around them. All to slow you down elude  you that victory. If you drive faster cars the ai does that to but it's less obstructive and less effective. Specially driving in races where pp is locked and you in a gr3 car. The ai almost always takes apex slower than if your 10 secs behind them. It's so that if you lose. You'll try again and rack up your playtime.\n\n### Comment ID m3yk2u3 with +1 score by [(HairyTough4489, Reddit, 2024-12-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/granturismo/comments/1hmurd0/im_so_tired_of_beating_19_cars_from_the_back_of/m3yk2u3/) (in reply to ID m3wu8wy):\nI think PD has made a mistake trusting all their AI development to the Sophy project.

Pick a ride with 10% less PP and find the best way to catch the leader for that particular race. \n\nFor example, the Porche Cup and Euro Club 600 on Nord both have you chasing an overpowered rival. The euro 600 race is two laps so it’s easier to focus on handling and grip with your PP, because getting smoked on the straight is waaay less of a negative if you have a whole second lap of corners to chew them up.\n\nThe Porsche cup is only one lap, and it usually rains, so cornering is far less of an exploitable angle.

Even if the AIs were too slow, give their cars more grip and power until they can fight a serious driver.

I get tired of negativity myself, especially because it often feels ill advised. \n\nBut I feel like its not crazy to ask why a game with already poor AI stages almost every race as a 19 car takedown, and makes this gameplay necessary to access the cars, tracks, etc.. It’s worsened further by how few credits you actually earn. \n\nI suspect the buckets of negativity around this game would be drastically reduced if these few things were addressed, and players were generally having more fun. Once people aren’t having much fun, the experience with every single thing is broadly worsened, and vitriol manifests towards things that really aren’t a big problem (or a problem at all) in isolation. I see people hating on the presence of Scapes. Scapes! It’s an indisputably amazing feature, people are just not having fun with the core gameplay. It puts a bad taste in your mouth.\n\nI would love to see Gran Turismo rectify this, so I can have more fun, and engage in a happier community. I’m sure they’d gain new players and hold onto veterans better, too. Improved AI goes a long way, but the actual design of the events is arguably a separate thing, and an even easier element to fix.

And if that isn't competitive enough, learn some real racecraft and go race online. \n\nBetween, all of those settings and options you should find plenty of challenges.\n\nThe issue is that people don't want a real challenge. They don't want to race for 15 minutes only to get 4th place and lose out on that easy money because the Race Hard Tires make everything too easy. \n\nEveryone wants big payouts and winnable fun races. You can't have both. Make the races harder and you make less. Make the races boring and easy, and you make bank.

I'm not looking for \"a challenge\". My core issue is not with overall race difficulty, it's with the repetitive scenarios. As the title says, \"I'm so tired of beating 19 cars from the back of the grid\". Rebalancing car performance on my end doesn't address this, I only mentioned making opponents faster as a method of potential game design to compensate in races where you'd perhaps start higher up the grid. So long as you have to pass 19 cars, the opponents always have to be considerably slower than you, period. I want to instead race some opponents driving at a similar speed for once, because that's what most real racing scenarios are.\n2. My issue with bringing up online play is that you still have to play the bland career to access the all game's cars, tracks, tuning parts, etc. to bring into multiplayer. Also, ironically, the singleplayer is terrible for learning good racecraft, and I'm saying it would be nice if it were a little better than that, both for quality of fun and for setting people up to enter the online spaces.\n\n#### Comment ID m3znjx3 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-12-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/granturismo/comments/1hmurd0/im_so_tired_of_beating_19_cars_from_the_back_of/m3znjx3/) (in reply to ID m3zn4jt):\n1) Then stick to Sophy Races, Custom Races, and Online Races.\n\n2) This game is old as hell.

There are very few real world racing scenarios where you move up 20 places against feet dragging opponents in 3 laps. You're usually somewhere in a pack against a few people who operate around your level, and most of the action comes in how you combat that.

Ultimately, the goal is to collect every car in the game. So the arcade like gameplay is just there to keep things slightly interesting for the first two laps. But I will say that once you get to the top three, it does become a little challenging. So it’s not like you were just passing 19 cars within a small window quickly. Even when tuning a certain car way to get things rolling fast and turning better. It’s also an easier way to keep a casual player on board with this kind of hardcore car junky presentation of these games. Especially one that’s being released by a major first party company. If this was even more challenging and realistic, Then those potential buyers will reject putting down 69.99 for this.\n\nThe only problem with an arcade racer in this kind of game is that there is a heavy promotion for this game to be the most realistic simulation of car racing in the video game landscape. And that is factually untrue within the gameplay of Gran Turismo.\n\nThis is where I suggest that the developer needs to program in this game a mode for hardcore players to be able to enjoy a non-multiplayer simulation mode. Because there is always a halfway player base that wants a challenge, But doesn’t want a user based challenge that will frustrate them. Those players just want to restart an off-line game till they figure out the right pattern to go through these tracks.\n\n## Comment ID m42hna6 with +1 score by [(mcfly_rules, Reddit, 2024-12-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/granturismo/comments/1hmurd0/im_so_tired_of_beating_19_cars_from_the_back_of/m42hna6/) (in reply to ID 1hmurd0):\nYeah that Bathurst chili race is just that\n\n## Comment ID m42sqap with +1 score by [(Sylsomnia, Reddit, 2024-12-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/granturismo/comments/1hmurd0/im_so_tired_of_beating_19_cars_from_the_back_of/m42sqap/) (in reply to ID 1hmurd0):\nMost part you ain't wrong.\nGt7 also need a quick race, all random apart from difficulty.\n\n## Comment ID m42wz0v with +1 score by [(see_the_fnords, Reddit, 2024-12-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/granturismo/comments/1hmurd0/im_so_tired_of_beating_19_cars_from_the_back_of/m42wz0v/) (in reply to ID 1hmurd0):\nHave you tried racing sophy?

Looks like PS4 can't handle Sophy, you're right. That sucks. It isn't much harder but very different. The drivers are creative and reactive, and do things like make mistakes when you put them under pressure, or get frustrated and push too hard if you pass them. Even the emojis are kinda cool. Definitely try it out if you get the opportunity. Hopefully the next incarnation of GT will have Sophy or something similar instead of the scripted \"AI\" drivers. They could then absolutely bring back qualifying and the single player experience would be a lot better.

Been playing for around 2 months and it feels slow to make money. I know there’s a lot available but large payouts at generally really tough like circuit experiences.

If you have it, you can equip it via the tuning parts section in the garage). If you get lucky with that, you can make some cash  to get the tomahawk and still do the grind before 50, or do the same grind with another high PP car in the interim.\n\n### Comment ID kplzivy with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GranTurismo7/comments/1amhb68/any_afk_farming_methods_for_new_update_not_level/kplzivy/) (in reply to ID kplxom3):\nIt's possible without swap/ sub level 50!\nYou don't even need the Tomahawk. Just your best car.\nPayout will be less, but still good for afk farming.\n\nSearch for those Beat/Daytona afk methods and use the same principle:\n 1. low pp tune honda beat - change to afk high hp tune in the race menu\n 2.

The R92CP just hit Legends a couple days ago for the first time that I remember in that time period.  Not sure how you could be tired of grinding with it already?  Maybe you mean grinding in general.  I get that, I work as well and have kids.  My time is limited.  From the research I've done I don't think AFK is worth the effort until hitting Level 50.  I plan to grind to that point then run AFK.\n\nFor reference I'm at Level 43 now.  Assuming you're somewhere similar it shouldn't take much longer.  Sargdena grind takes 25 mines to get $725k.  If you're doing that 3x day that $2.2 million/day.  Should put us close to Level 50 in a week or two with a couple decent Driving Marathon Raffle ticket wins..\n\nSide note - I'm enjoying the grind as it builds credit fast while providing an opportunity to work on technique.  I've shaved off 4 seconds a lap in the couple days I've been doing it since the R92CP came out.  Take a ride along with the circuit experience demo.  Work on hitting the apexes correctly and nailing braking points perfectly every time.  I still don't know how they go through the left turn after the little farm house flat out at 150mph."

      "# [Two Double Golds, First Gold, Highlight Championship Sunday in Daytona Beach](https://www.theapp.global/news/2025-daytona-recap)\nThe Association of Pickleball Players (APP) brought the adrenaline to the Birthplace of Speed, hosting five high-octane Championship Sunday matches at the APP Vlasic Classic in Daytona Beach. The world’s first and world’s best pickleball tour welcomed pickleball players from all ages and skill levels over five exciting days at Pictona at Holly Hill, culminating with a new set of champions.\n\nMegan Fudge, the APP’s all-time women’s total medal leader, and 20-year-old phenom Jack Munro stole the show with two gold medals each, including as mixed doubles partners. Former University of Miami tennis standout Sofia Sewing won her first career APP Tour gold medal in women’s singles, while Chris Haworth wrapped up his seventh consecutive men’s singles title. Munro took home the men’s doubles title alongside Will Howells, who also earned two silvers, plus Fudge and Jill Braverman collected another pair of gold medals in women's doubles.\n\nIn addition to showcasing pickleball’s elite professionals, the APP Vlasic Classic in Daytona Beach welcomed a large field of amateur players, the AARP Champions and AARP Masters Divisions, and the first round of the 2025 season-long Humana Cup team competition for pros 50 and older. Gold medalists from the event secured their rights to pre-register for the 2025 USA Pickleball National Championships.\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\nWomen’s Pro Singles‍\n\nThe Championship Sunday slate started with No. 16-seed Sofia Sewing taking on No. 11-seed Daria Walczak for women’s doubles gold. Sewing built off a silver-medal performance at the Humana APP Fort Lauderdale Open with a strong opening game, winning 15-12. The Miami, Fla. native continued her momentum into game two, cruising past Walczak 15-10, to clinch her first career APP Tour gold medal.\n\n“This week was really hot, we were grinding the matches in the Florida humidity,” Sewing commented. “You have to be very mentally and physically tough, and I was just excited to play. I really love how [Daria] plays, and I think we play similarly. Mentally I was just prepared to grind a little bit and stay patient. I played a lot of good players and will keep improving myself, and I’m happy that I did.”\n\nAmanda Hendry earned women’s singles bronze in Daytona Beach.\n\n‍\n\nMen’s Pro Doubles\n\nIn a rematch from two weeks ago, the men’s doubles final featured the top-seeded Will Howells and Jack Munro against the Pacific Northwest duo of Erik Lange and Max “Purple Jesus” Manthou. Howells and Munro hit the ground running in their title defense, taking game one 12-10. Lange and Manthou wouldn’t go down without a fight, taking a 7-2 lead early in game two. Howells and Munro regrouped and stormed back to win, 11-9, securing their second straight APP Tour men’s doubles gold medals to start 2025.\n\nAsked what made the difference in the game, Munro commented, “Our change of rhythm and change of pace. We ended up playing their game for a bit, and they took advantage of it big time. We used a timeout and had a little change of strategy, we recognized a few patterns that worked and got it done.”\n\n“We’re really having fun,” added Howells. “We talk really well with each other on the court.”\n\nMark Dancuart and Patrick Kawka took home the men’s doubles bronze medals.\n\n‍\n\nWomen’s Pro Doubles\n\nNext up on Championship Court, the women’s doubles final pitted one of the APP Tour’s most experienced duos, Jill Braverman and Megan Fudge, against an impressive first-time partnership in Susannah Barr and Daria Walczak. Experience proved to be key in this matchup, as Braverman and Fudge dominated 11-0 and 11-3 en route to their second-straight women’s doubles title together.\n\n“We did our homework,” Fudge said following the win. “We did some great studying last night and we executed our game plan.”\n\n“When you play together a lot you have the benefit of not having to over-talk or over-communicate, and it just comes from being a partnership” added Braverman.\n\nKelsey Grambeau and Allison Harris battled to win the women’s doubles bronze in Daytona Beach.\n\n‍\n\nMixed Pro Doubles\n\nAnother rematch from the APP Tour’s season opener in Fort Lauderdale followed suit to Daytona Beach, as Jill Braverman and Will Howells faced off against Megan Fudge and Jack Munro for the mixed doubles title. Fudge and Munro came out swinging, controlling game one to win 11-2. Following a brief medical timeout in game two, Munro and Fudge rallied from down 8-2 to win 11-9 and take home the golds.\n\n“This guy’s a beast right here,” Fudge said, referring to Munro. “A lot of resilience. I have a lot of respect for him and his competitive spirit. He came back out here and gave it his all, and I’m just proud to be on the court with him. He carries me every other day, so it was my time to step up.”\n\nAmanda Hendry and Chris Haworth won mixed doubles bronze, marking Haworth’s first career APP Tour doubles medal.\n\n‍\n\nMen’s Pro Singles\n\nThe action concluded with Will Howell’s third title match of the afternoon, facing six-time defending men’s singles champion Chris Haworth. Haworth’s consistency guided him to an undefeated record over his last six tournaments entering the weekend, and used that consistency once more in Daytona Beach. The Oklahoma City native won each game 15-10 en route to his seventh consecutive APP Tour men’s singles title and 30th straight match win.\n\n“I liked my aggression a lot,” Haworth said. “I feel like I came out and swung a little harder at my shots, used my ground strokes and adapted as I went.”\n\nAlex Crum took home men’s singles bronze.\n\n‍\n\nAARP Champions and Masters Pro Action\n\nIn AARP Champions Division (50+) competition in Daytona Beach, Marcello Jardim won two gold medals - one in men’s doubles with Jaime Oncins and another in men’s singles. Sheri Courter and Jose Derisi won the mixed doubles title, Angela Simon and Lee Whitwell earned another women’s gold title, and Cantillon Endara won the women’s singles gold.\n\nIn AARP Masters Division (60+) action, Steve Price and David Spearman won the men’s doubles title, Kristin Hickman and Diane Wainio took home the women’s doubles title, and Heather Iffert and John Moorin teamed up for mixed doubles gold. Lee Sponaugle earned the men’s singles gold.\n\n‍\n\nHumana Cup Competition\n\nPictona at Holly Hill played host to the Humana Cup, a season-long team competition for pros aged 50 and older, with the first event of the 2025 standings race.

      "# [Dramatic finale of the 24h Daytona deprives BMW M Hybrid V8 and BMW M4 GT3 EVO of chances to win.](https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/usa/article/detail/T0447715EN_US/dramatic-finale-of-the-24h-daytona-deprives-bmw-m-hybrid-v8-and-bmw-m4-gt3-evo-of-chances-to-win?language=en_US)\nDaytona. For more than 23 hours, BMW M Team RLL and Paul Miller Racing had their sights set on victory at the 24 Hours of Daytona (USA), but a dramatic final stage dashed all hopes of a well-deserved reward for a great performance by BMW M Motorsport at the season opener of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IWSC). Dries Vanthoor (BEL), who had secured pole position in the #24 BMW M Hybrid V8, collided with a competitor while fighting for second place and fell to fourth place due to the subsequent repairs. A similar fate befell Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) in the #1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, who was also contending for the win but ultimately had to settle for fourth position in the GTD-PRO class after an incident.\n\nDespite the disappointment over the frustrating final stage of the race, BMW M Motorsport looks back on a very strong race weekend at Daytona. Both the BMW M Hybrid V8 and the BMW M4 GT3 EVO demonstrated their enormous potential and made a significant impact on the track. Vanthoor, starting as the lead driver for the #24 from pole position – the first for BMW M Motorsport's LMDh project – built a 25-second lead in his first double-stint. Although this was levelled by numerous yellow flag periods, it underscored the strength of the vehicle. The same applies to the fastest race lap, which Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) drove in 1:35.868 minutes in the #25 BMW M Hybrid V8 which also showed impressive speed but fell back due to several incidents, finishing in seventh place. Both BMW M Hybrid V8s had no technical issues.\n\nIn the GTD-PRO class, Paul Miller Racing played several leading roles. The #48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO led the race into the evening but was then hit by an opponent in a mass collision. The heavily damaged vehicle was repaired thanks to the great efforts of the mechanics but lost many laps and crossed the finish line in twelfth place. The sister #1 car stepped up, moved up from its 13th starting position, and fought for the win until just before the end. Kelvin van der Linde had the podium in sight at his race debut for BMW M Motorsport until he was forced into a spin by an opponent and fell back to fourth place. In the GTD class, Turner Motorsport also gave a strong performance, finishing the race with the #96 BMW M4 GT3 EVO in fifth place.\n\nNote to editors:\n\nYou can find video interviews with BMW M Motorsport head Andreas Roos and the BMW M factory drivers, as well as footage from Daytona for editorial use at the following link: https://f.io/bX42CP2u.\n\nComments after the 24h Daytona:\n\nFranciscus van Meel (CEO of BMW M GmbH): \"Of course we had hoped for a different outcome of the Daytona weekend. With 50 minutes left, we were in the fight for the win in all categories. Everyone could see how fast and reliable our car is. The drivers and the teams did a great job and made no mistakes. But that's racing.\"\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “A big thank you to the entire team. Unfortunately, we had a weekend of ups and downs. If we only look at the race results, we cannot be satisfied with the fourth places in the GTP and GTD PRO classes. We started the weekend well, achieving very good results in both the free practice sessions and in qualifying – with Dries Vanthoor on pole position (GTP) and Dan Harper in third place (GTD PRO). That was very promising. For much of the race, we were able to compete for class victories and even the overall win. That's the positive we want to take with us. When you fight for the top positions in a 24-hour race for so long though, it is ultimately sad and disappointing for the teams and drivers who have invested a lot of work to get there - it would have been deserved to win at least one, if not the winner's trophy. Nevertheless, we must take the positives: the strong trend from 2024 clearly continues, we were able to build on it and field a competitive car in the GTP class here. The BMW M4 GT3 EVO has also shown in its third race that it can compete against the toughest competition – also in IMSA.”\n\nDries Vanthoor (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 4th place): “I want to say a massive congratulations to my brother. If there is someone who should win the race if it is not me then it is my brother. He has had a good time in the last couple of races and seasons and I am very happy for him. I for sure am very gutted with this result. We showed a great pace and that the car is capable of doing it. Obviously finishing in P4 in a 24 hour race is not the end of the world, but at the end of the day it is very sad to fight for 22 hours and not come home with a podium, which we for sure deserved. I feel sorry for the guys, who have been working very hard and also to my teammates. I would have loved to gift them with something, but most important is that we showed that we were strong and able to fight. We will make sure to come back and we will win this race.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 7th place): “It was a very disappointing ending to the race for us. We had a very good package to fight for the win, which we showed all week long so we were quite positive heading into the race. Unfortunately we had a small issue in the pit stop with the brake change. That cost us three laps and we never really manage to make it back again. Obviously that was not the reward we wanted to give all the guys for the hard work all over the winter trying to make sure we have a fast car that is able to fight for the win. But we will definitely take a lot of notes from the race weekend, try to improve for Sebring and really bring that podium home.”\n\nKelvin van der Linde (#1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 4th place GTD PRO): “It is a proud moment for me, fighting the whole race for the win. It was a good mileage for me, learning the car for the first time. To narrowly have missed out on the win is more than I could have ever expected. It was unfortunate as we led the race for the last two hours. The last pit stop was where we unfortunately lost track position and we weren’t really able to overtake looking forward. The rest is history. We will come back and try again next time.”\n\nMax Hesse (# 48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 12th place GTD PRO):\n\n“First of all, I would like to express a huge thank you to BMW M Motorsport and Paul Miller Racing. It was the first time I was able to start here. It's a very cool event and it remains my dream to win here someday. This year, we definitely had the package to do it. Unfortunately, we were involved in a big crash, which was not our fault. I was very well warned by my team, but unfortunately, our competitors behind us were not. That's part of it. Our car ran great. The mechanics did a top job getting us back on track. I think we've gained good experience for Sebring - and there we'll try to go full attack again.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (#48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 12th place GTD PRO): “The situation with the Corvette and our sister car was very difficult. My intention was to support my teammate in the sister car in the fight for victory. I was aware that it was hard racing. The situation that led to the collision between the Corvette and Connor De Phillippi behind me was very unfortunate – but I had nothing to do with it directly. I stayed on my inside line.”\n\nJens Klingmann (#96 BMW M4 GT 3 EVO, Turner Motorsport, 5th place GTD):\n\n“Looking solely at the result, fifth place for Turner Motorsport was the best 24-hour race at Daytona. On the other hand, we entered to win. Therefore, we are very frustrated. Half an hour before the end of the race, we were in second place and had done many things right up to that point. When you then finish in fifth place, at first glance you tend to see the negatives, but we gave it our all, and that was the maximum we could achieve with the overall package. I am still proud that after the BMW M4 GT3 was already capable of winning in its first two dress rehearsals in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, we also had the cars in the lead for a long time here and once again proved that the car has the potential to win races. This gives me a positive outlook; we will take this experience home, continue working, and then I think it will still be a very successful season.”",

They discuss the importance of developer experience, security in development environments, and the role of AI in transforming the developer landscape. Ivan shares insights into Daytona’s roadmap, including their open-source and enterprise offerings, and emphasizes the need for a seamless developer experience.\n\nThis was a RedMonk video, sponsored by Daytona.\n\nTranscript\n\nKate Holterhoff\n\nHello and welcome to this RedMonk Conversation. My name is Kate Holterhoff, senior analyst at RedMonk and with me today is Ivan Burazin, co founder and CEO at Daytona. Ivan, thank you so much for joining me on this conversation.\n\nIvan Burazin\n\nThanks for having me, Kate.\n\nKate\n\nAll right, so let’s begin with some background here. Can you tell us a little bit about yourself? What is your history in terms of education, career? Yeah. Just anything you’d care to share?\n\nIvan\n\nSure. I mean mostly been solving or catering to developers most of my career. So at very early beginning probably a quasi developer. So did websites and whatever. But after that created a company called Code Anywhere way back in the day, which is one of the first browser based IDEs, which led to the company which we are today, but in the meantime also created this developer conference. So a conference focused exclusively on developers, did that for almost a decade, sold that and led the developer experience initiative at this fairly large private company. And so today again trying to make developers lives better, hopefully happier with Daytona, which is a, what we call dev environment manager.\n\nKate\n\nAll right, and yeah, let’s shift directly into that here. So talk to me about Daytona. What is Daytona?\n\nIvan\n\nSo Daytona, the reason we built Daytona and sort of how it started is when way back in the day when we were creating this browser based IDE interface, unlike Google Docs or whatever, you actually have to have a runtime to be able to execute the code and run the code. And so when we were doing this in 2009, 10, 12 and like way, way, way back, there was very few things off the shelf that we could use. And so we had to build all of these things around the infrastructure to be able to execute code. And that was a good learning — like today in Daytona we use a lot of off the shelf things. Like we don’t want to rebuild, you don’t want to reinvent the wheel, right. But we did learn sort of how you should structure these things. And what happened was probably about two years ago we had a bunch of interest. And I think also it was really interesting was there was a RedMonk article actually that said next year is the year of cdes or cloud development environments, another word for what we are. And that’s when we were actually contemplating to come “back into the space.”\n\nThere was, like you all wrote an article about that. We got people from other analyst houses interested because their customers were interested. And so what they were interested in was not the SaaS browser based editor, but a on prem enterprise solution to automate these dev environments. Because they have become so complex in these large organizations. It was very, very hard or it is very hard still for people to onboard, but not just onboard, but to collaborate on other parts of the company. Like once you’ve got it set up and running, that’s fine, but if you want to help someone else, it’s very, very hard. And so it just became this big pull to sort of suck us into this space which had not been solved. And so we were very wary about that. And we did a bunch of research and found out that it is an actual issue. And so what is the issue and what are the problems? I should probably get into that — is we divide it into three segments which is developer productivity, security and scalability. And developer productivity is what a lot of people associate this with, is that, you know, one button you spin up your dev environment, it works.\n\nYou don’t have to read through the readme, you don’t have to like debug. No works in my machine problem. Great. Scalability is what we refer to when the machine that you work on or that you got from the company is constrained by the resources that it has. So very often in companies like you can have a brand new M4 Mac. Awesome. And you still might not be able to run the entire dev environment that you want. And so how do you solve that? Well, you usually have to get a EC2 instance or something from your DevOps team. You have to connect to that. It’s complicated, expensive, and you have to also work bother the DevOps team. And so that’s scalability. And the third one is security, just the CISO vertical. Especially in very security stringent companies, they must as a mandate have all the source code behind their firewall on prem whatever. And the only way to do that is via VDIs, which is a very, very terrible experience and more costly than something like a Daytona. So we offer like a good experience. So like one that you would like to use versus I don’t know if people have used VDIs.\n\nI’ve used them in my career. Like I would not want to work eight hours a day in that. And so can we get a great experience developers while also making sure that everything is secure and then hopefully it’s more cost effective than the VDI itself.\n\nKate\n\nRight. Yeah. The problems that developer environments seem to solve really take me back to when I was a practitioner and I remember at one point I had this very old operating system running on my computer because it would break our developer environment if I tried to update. And so it was such a problem, I know for many developers that are actually working in this space to try to make sure that they have this consistency for all the engineers working in there. And I feel like the sort of problems that you’re identifying here with these VDIs, et cetera are — it’s just so universal and I’m surprised it hasn’t been solved yet. So it’s great that Daytona is sort of moving us in this direction, but it does bring me to this question that I have about why Daytona came about, which is why do we need to manage developer environments? You use the acronym DEM, Development Environment Management, and Daytona is a platform for those. So how did this need come about? Why is it that management is something that’s going to solve the pain that I personally experienced as a practitioner and I know folks are still grappling with.\n\nIvan\n\nYeah, it’s part of it. It’s interesting that no one solved it yet. I think that it was not enough of a pain back then because to your comment, it’s probably like you just don’t update and it works. That’s the solution. But also, if we think about the history of what an IDE is like an integrated development environment, for the most part, when you used Eclipse or whatever it was, NetBeans, Visual Studio, the original one, they were IDEs in the sense they had everything integrated in that piece of software. They’re like very large pieces of software where you would remember this also when I was like much younger, we’d open up Visual Studio and you create a new project in it. You type code and you hit run. If the code was correct, it would run right like that was it. There was nothing else to do. Like fast forward. Today I was talking to one of our customers or onboarding them as a customer right now. The dev environment that they have — this is their words. It takes them two to three weeks to get one person onboarded. Like that’s how long it takes because they have to spin up some services locally, they have to spin some of them remotely.\n\nThen they have to spin up their own, some proxy, I forgot which one it was. And the developer has to do all the networking to make sure that all connects and all works and the back to the IDEs. Today most of us use text editors essentially, not IDEs. And the reason is because you actually can’t fit all of these things inside that one piece of software. There’s all sort of like microservices or even more specific. What we have quite often is multiple monorepos in one system. And so the idea itself cannot solve it. So we’ve fallen back to really good text editors, which is usually Vs code. And the developer now has to go and figure all this stuff out, right? So we’ve gone from a place where the software would solve a lot of it, where now the software has become so complex that it does not solve it, and now we need a new solution to solve that again, which. It sounds sort of cyclical and all that, but I feel what Daytona is trying to solve is sort of bring us back to that place where it’s like, open this thing or point to a git repository in our case and just actually start coding.\n\nLike, not worry about anything else. Everything else is ready to go. You just have to worry that the code that you write is actually good and does what you want to do. And so that’s how I feel. And looking back, how the illusion and why there wasn’t that much investment to solve it before, because there were sort of like the way we coded before was good enough or it was not a big enough pain point to actually validate a solution like Daytona.\n\nKate\n\nRight. And it seems like the agnosticism of the systems that you support then would have to be extremely broad. I mean, every cloud, every IDE. I mean, how is Daytona able to manage just the breadth of development environments that modern engineering departments leverage?\n\nIvan\n\nSweat, I guess that would be the answer. It is one of those… I forgot what the word was watching an interview of the founder of Plaid. Plaid, the Fintech, the very successful one that was supposed to be acquired by Visa. And so basically what they did is just like they connected all the — they have one interface that connected all the APIs of all the banks in the United States of America. Right. And so it is more, I think the word was like a grind project versus a technological product. Not saying that Daytona is not complex, it very much is. But one of the biggest problems creating Daytona is like being able to work with all these providers of infrastructure, so cloud providers on prem, whatever it may be, on one hand, all the IDEs on the other, all the git repositories, and making sure that no matter what variations or combinations you use as a user, that the interface and experience is the same. I think that is the biggest job of Daytona, per se. So when your question is like, how do we do that? Very, very hard, I think. And also when you look at dev environments, the ones that we support and the ones that we’re going to support, right now it’s mostly monorepo projects.\n\nNow looking at poly Repo projects and spinning them up, there’s different ways to spin this up. And we’re trying to right now define a “standard” for the user interface. No matter what you’re using underneath to spin these up, that it feels quite the same. And so I have to say that the architecture of that is probably the hardest part of the job.\n\nKate\n\nWow. Okay, so it sounds like I was able to intuit that just from the fact that my brain was exploding thinking about the sort of multiple possibilities, or infinite possibilities rather. Yeah, let’s pivot a little bit and talk about something that you mentioned, which is Developer Experience. So at RedMonk, of course we’re always thinking about developers and how they interact with the tools that are part of their workflows. So I was really interested to find a blog post on Daytona’s website by Nikola Balić called the Developer Experience Revolution, which certainly piqued my interest. Nikola’s the head of growth at Daytona, and in this article he’s arguing for the importance of “modern DX focused tools.” So I’m interested in the role that Developer Experience plays in Daytona’s roadmap and your go to market strategy. How has Daytona made prioritizing Developer Experience central to its value proposition?\n\nIvan\n\nSure, I mean, there’s so many things. I mean, prior to Daytona, I was, the title was Chief Developer Experience Officer, I think I was one of the two or three people that had that title. Interesting title for sure. But what we had to do with that job or what was the mandate or what we had oversight under was everything from sign up from the PLG motion to the documentation to what the API looked like. There were so many things to, you know, community building events, whatever it may be. So all of that sort of falls under, I feel, Developer Experience. So on a very, very high level, it is like every interaction developer has with your company and or product can be measured under that. And then specifically what do you do to make your developer experience as good as it can be? I mean there’s very, there’s specific things that I can always say and I’m actually — the one thing I start off with mostly, and Daytona’s not perfect yet in that sense, but I definitely feel that documentation is something that most companies don’t work with a lot. And I feel that especially if you’re a dev tool, if you’re an API, whatever, like your product is the docs, almost like that is — like if you think about when a developer interfaces with your product, it’s probably more with the docs than the actual product.\n\nAnd so that’s why I feel like docs should definitely be assumed. You could think about it as product and invest as much time as you can to make them as good as they can be. And I’m saying with a caveat, is that we’re trying really hard and I still don’t think we’re there in the sense of like the docs, but we’re trying very hard with that. Everything else falls in the product itself, we call them basically paper cuts. And so like as a developer, so first, time to first value is like, if you set that from the idea to, oh, this is a new product, I want to try it out to actually getting value… like, how long is that time? Is it an hour? Is it a half hour? Is it two days? Is it five minutes? Is it 35 seconds? How fast can you get to that value is probably one of the best indicators that people are going to try it, see the value at least, and then see if that value is actually valuable to them and then move on from there. So I’d say that documentation and after that would be what we call paper cuts.\n\nAnd paper cuts are… some people say it’s like design, but I don’t think it’s design. It’s more than that. It is the interactions which you have with a product that lead you astray or blocker. So you try, you’re going through this path and then it sort of stops. Or doesn’t do what you would expect it to do. And this could be in a CLI tool, it could be in a dashboard, it could be in anything. But basically, how do you sort of like sand off those sort of like edges to the software to make it an enjoyable experience as much as you can. And I say this because when you look at companies like, so Vercel, I’m just going to pick on Vercel right now. And you have these Internet memes. I have nothing against Vercel. Just like Internet memes, I think, DHH put it up where it’s like, oh, this is just like AWS hidden behind this. And they’re just charging a premium for that. And it might be true, but what premium are they charging on? They’re charging on that great experience. Just the experience of using anyone that’s used Amazon or AWS.\n\nIt’s just like that’s the worst thing in the world? And a lot of people are super happy to pay the extra just to have it better, easier, faster, get to what they want. So that’s sort of my take on that. I’d love to hear also yours if you have anything to add on that. But that was an example that’s very showing or telling of what you can achieve with great developer experience.\n\nKate\n\nYeah, well, I mean, I think you’ve hit the nail on the head. In terms of Vercel and sort of these abstractions that we can, you know, that are using developers unwillingness to deal with all the sort of fiddly bits that go on with a lot of infrastructure. Yeah, absolutely. There’s a real market for that. But I also think that it points to the fact that, you know, developers are extremely important to making a lot of these purchasing decisions and that ranges not only with the sort of backend IT folks who have historically made a lot of these purchasing decisions, but also developers who are working towards the top of the stack. So in my own research I focus a lot on JavaScript developers and they tend to be the ones that are targeted by Vercel. I mean they call themselves a front end cloud. So this is a sort of new era of targeting front end developers in particular and noticing that they are the ones who increasingly making these decisions. But I think you point to this idea of abstractions which is extremely important to how a lot of products are finding their niche in the developer tooling space right now.\n\nAnd so, yeah, making a product that is going to appeal to developers by making their own lives easier and yes, sawing off sharp edges and making sure that they’re actually enjoying the tools that they’re using. Absolutely. That’s a surefire way of making sure that they’re actually going to use the products available to them, not let them just become shelfware, but also make the difficult parts not so terrible. You have mentioned security a couple times. Absolutely. A lot of times developers don’t want to think about the problems of security because that’s not what they want to be doing. They want to be writing business logic. They want to be doing the fun parts, building features. They don’t want to be dealing with — everyone jokes about YAML, right? I knew some front end developers who were in YAML hell, that’s not what they want to be writing. So I think if Daytona is able to make sure that these developers are able to work on the parts of their job that they actually enjoy. Absolutely. That’s what makes developer experience so key to making sure that products are actually meeting developers where they are, but also, yeah, that they’re improving this entire domain of developer tools so that everybody is satisfied. Everybody is getting what they want, be it the CISOs, folks who are interested in security, or just the developers who want to not hate their lives, who want to not become burned out by doing labor that they don’t find appealing. That isn’t the sort of joy giving part of their career choice.\n\nIvan\n\nAbsolutely. So, yeah, glad we agree on that one.\n\nKate\n\nYeah. And so I did kind of bring up this idea of security here, and I actually would be interested in maybe pivoting this to talk about some of the ways that Daytona is looking at security, because you speak a lot about the hybrid approach, so that Daytona is leveraging both local and cloud development. And so I’m interested in why that would be more secure than just working on local or on prem. How is the cloud actually helping companies to maintain their security posture that they need?\n\nIvan\n\nSure. I think it goes back to… so a lot of people in enterprises will probably know Microsoft Outlook, for example, everyone uses Microsoft Outlook. And so if you think about Microsoft Outlook, you have this desktop, there’s a web application, but the vast majority of people still use the desktop one because it’s just a better feeling. And so everything feels like it’s local. You’re working on your machine, there’s like an offline mode, whatever. But if you’re in a large enterprise and for some reason your laptop gets, you know, stolen, you are let go or you leave or whatever it may be, whatever reason, the security team can revoke all access to that email and it’s gone from the machine instantaneously. Right? It is absolutely gone. For software development that does not exist. Like, there’s no way to do that. All the, like, most developers are working on their local machine. And even if they’re working on a local machine, some of that can be tamed or looked at. But if they’re working inside of a Docker container, for the vast majority of companies, that is a black box. Like, not only can they not revoke it, they don’t even know what is going on.\n\nAnd so people might think, oh, you know, Big Brother, whatever. But the companies that I talk to, it’s not about oppression in the sense of like, oh, are you working your eight hours a day? Or whatever it is? Like, are the things that are running, are they allowed to be run? Can we flag if something’s running that’s not supposed to be an insecure, you know, whatever dependency library are you connecting to APIs or whatever that are, you’re not allowed to. Is traffic going through the network that it’s supposed to do? There’s all these things that you can now manage through a, or see or have observability through a system like Daytona. And so Daytona gives developers that same Microsoft Outlook analogy, although not all of them have used it. Whereas you can use your desktop VS code. It feels local. You know, it is. There is a local option as well, but in general, most of them keep all the source code or dev environments in the cloud, in the cloud being on prem like an actual IBM HP server inside a data center or AWS, if people choose that as well. And so you as a developer feel that it’s there, it’s local, everything’s proxy, it’s local host.\n\nBut the, you know, SecOps people in the company can, you know, revoke access, remove this. It is not on your laptop. Actually, there is observability tools that are there and more are being added, reporting tools. All these things that you might need post the fact of any sort of security issue and that in today’s world is not feasible at all. And so when we talk about security, that’s sort of what we talk about inside Daytona.\n\nKate\n\nThat makes sense. All right, and so I gotta ask, let’s talk about how AI is transforming the developer environment space. How is Daytona looking at our new AI era?\n\nIvan\n\nSure. I mean, AI. I think I wrote an article about — the title, I took it from someone else, so it’s not a great title. AI Agnostic Infrastructure Middleware. So like a very, very long word. The idea behind it is that AI coding is here both as an augmentation of humans and fully autonomous. But there is a lot of limitations. So you’ll see a lot of demos and most of those demos are like fairly, fairly simple apps. Like if you try to do something more complicated, for the most part it doesn’t work. I’m talking about the autonomous ones where the augmentation is pretty good. It can be better, but pretty good. And so looking at how things work right now, the way it works, and I take Cursor as an example, and they’re doing really well. They wrote this whole article about how they actually have an invisible electron pane that you can’t see while you’re typing in Cursor and the AI using the code base and the file you’re on, trying to figure out, you know, what is the best outcome and what it deems the best. Basically, that is what you see as a suggestion to what you’re doing.\n\nAnd so there’s, there are limitations to that. It’s not perfect, it’s very far from it. And the reason it is far from it is that coding is not just files, it is like runtimes and outputs and debuggers and linters and all these things that a human has. And the AI actually doesn’t have access to that, really. I’m not going to get into anthropics like whole use my computer as a human part, but as an AI agent, coding agent, right now they don’t have access. And so what we talk about now with Daytona and dev environments management, remote dev environments generally is, is this or the way we see the future going is imagine an AI agent can actually spin up a replica of what you’re working on and actually test and see outputs of what it is trying. You would then get the suggestion or the output or the PR what you had gotten would be tested because the AI could spin up a identical dev environment, see the output, if the output is desired, it will send you back, oh, here it is. Because it already knows the output is right. And that is only if you think of like one to one.\n\nSo if an AI agent is equal to human and they’re just working on one, but an AI agent could in theory spin up to 10, 15, 30, 100, 1000. These dev environments, of course, if you have budget like all of them cost something, right? And so you can think about, let’s say you’ve raised a new round or whatever, you are a large company and you have to get to a outcome very fast. You’re like, okay, I can spin up the dial and have much more vertically spun up these environments to get to the desired outcome as fast as I possibly can, right? And so in a world where a lot more will be done, coding done by AI, I feel that the only way to do this, and we’ve talked to a bunch of AI co generation companies, they all have this bottleneck or the ceiling right now and they’re all trying to figure this out. And so there is no standard yet around this. And so we’re trying to work with as much as we can to define a standard around the API endpoints. An agent would need to be able to always get the information at once and spin up and spin down these environments.\n\nKate\n\nYeah, that’s huge. So not only are we thinking about this in terms of the developers who are using AI code assistance, but also in terms of our agentic future, which is going to be throughout the entire stack that there’s suddenly going to be AI. I mean I’ve heard folks talk about AI native now is I think the buzz word. So. That’s the word. So, yes, our AI native future that this is also going to be part of it. And I like this idea of working on standards collaboratively because it seems like that is sort of the inflection point when we know that a technology is mature enough that there is sort of buy in from enough organizations and enough enterprise customers that are willing to invest in this and try to figure out what is going to work across the board.\n\nIvan\n\nYeah, I mean you have to try it out. Like it’s also all thesis, like you’re not sure what you’re doing. So we’ve actually just recently launched a version of OpenHands, previously called OpenDevin, that runs on Daytona. So it’s like a SaaS product, but it’s OpenHands, it’s running on it. We’re also doing one with continue.dev which is a copilot, similar to GitHub Copilot, and it runs on Daytona infrastructure. And so it sort of, we did it to first see if it was feasible. And then the other is it’s a conversation starter with all the companies where it’s like, hey, we’ve already built this thing. Like you might as well use it because it’ll make your life probably easier. Anyway. That’s how we think about it. And we’re very much into experiments at Daytona and those are some of the experiments we’re doing. And we have some more coming up. And I think it’s really exciting when you see something that you’ve created, you can just add on things on top. In this example, in OpenHands, a continue or someone else and it just works magically out of the box. So we’re very excited about that in the future.\n\nKate\n\nI can see why. All right, so talk to me about the roadmap at Daytona. What else should folks who are interested in the space be thinking about?\n\nIvan\n\nSo the roadmap for Daytona, we have a open source product and we have an enterprise product. We’ve actually split them up into two different ones. Unlike a lot of companies, I think we didn’t open source the entire, let’s call it enterprise product. There was a couple reasons for that. One is the licensing becomes very complicated if you’re trying to give something open source that you also try to sell or put on the market because you’re trying to figure out, oh, can I make it open, but sort of restrict something, do I give this out, do I not? And so I think there’s… and we’ve seen a lot of issues with that recently. You know, companies having clawing back licenses, whatnot and so we really didn’t want to do that. And it’s also when you think about, like the value, what you’re trying to do is the thing that you open source, you’re trying to give value to one set of people. The thing that you charge for, you’re trying to give value to another set of people, right? In our case, you want to open source the value of the developer. And that developer also doesn’t want this like, clunky, huge thing that they have to install.\n\nThey want just like this quick one button, spin it up, it works. And so what we did, we created the core, let’s call it Core of Daytona, which is the developer experience. Like one button, it spins up a dev environment. You point where you want to run it, it does all that. And that is like Apache 2.0, actual open source. Anyone can, you know, fork it, use it, do whatever they want with it. And then we have the enterprise, which is actually the open source is upstreamed into the enterprise, and the enterprise is everything the enterprise actually wants to pay for. And so who are you giving value to then? Well, we’re giving value to the DevOps manager, CTO, CISO, whatnot. And so what are they interested in? They’re interested in team management, compliance, logging, audit logs, sso, like all these different things. And none of that is in the open source because the individual developer actually doesn’t care. So we basically have these two products, one that upstreams into the other. And for the open source, just like getting back to the question, which is roadmap, Daytona open source is, you know, it’s been out there since March.\n\nWe have like 10,000 people, stars on GitHub, a bunch of people using it, and a lot of the functionalities are actually done, one of the most important things that’s coming up is basically it was a CLI tool only. And so GUI Dashboard, we didn’t want to do it at all, but it just seems that people like it a lot. And I guess that’s why Docker did it and everyone else did it. So there is a graphic user interface coming very soon just to expand the amount of people it can actually attract. And the second thing that it’s adding, and this will go upstream to the Enterprise as well, as we talked about before, is creating — right now it’s like monorepo dev environments, where in the future you’ll be able to have multiple monorepos. Like you can do microservices right now, but actually very complex multiple monorepo environments that will spin up multiple physical VMs or containers and also be able to connect to external services on AWS or whatever it may be. And so that is something that will be launched both in the open source and the enterprise.\n\nAnd probably the biggest thing outside of the AI native things that we’re adding in there, that would be probably the biggest thing that is coming. From the enterprise side, it’s just a bunch of “boring things” where it’s not exciting. It’s like, what new things does compliance want out of the product? And that is what we’re building. And so that is mostly the open source, the enterprise side that is coming up.\n\nKate\n\nYeah. So just, just a few things. Just a small — I get it.\n\nIvan\n\nSmall bunch of things. Yeah.\n\nKate\n\nAll right. Well, it has been an absolute pleasure speaking with you today, Ivan. Let’s just kind of round up by talking about how folks can keep up with what you’re doing at Daytona. So what are your preferred social channels and how can folks, yeah, what’s the best way to maybe get in touch with you if folks want to follow up?\n\nIvan\n\nSure. Daytona.io, the website is probably where we have everything and all the information is there. Obviously there’s a community Slack, GitHub is there, Twitter and LinkedIn. So all of them are there. Also, if they want me, first [email protected], feel free to shoot me an email. Also, I’m in the Slack, so you can DM me directly in Daytona Slack if you join, so yeah.",

AdventHealth Daytona Beach says the project will add 104 beds to the hospital, boosting capacity from 362 beds to 466 beds.\n\nTwo of the hospital’s existing towers will be standing a little taller when the project is done. One tower will rise four stories higher, while another tower is going to get a one-story expansion in the project. The hospital is planning to add four new surgical suites as well.\n\nThe project will add more than 240,000 square feet to the hospital. When completed, the Daytona Beach hospital will occupy just under 1 million square feet.\n\nAdventHealth says the project should be completed by the fall of 2026.\n\nRead more: How AdventHealth works to nurture and retain nurses\n\nOfficials say the project includes plans for an expanded cardiovascular intensive care unit and a dedicated neuro-ICU unit. Other elements of the project include a new laboratory department, a new and bigger pharmacy, and expanded imaging services.\n\nThe expansive project follows the recent completion of a new ambulatory surgical center and medical office building. The $45.7 million facility opened earlier this month.\n\nAudrey Gregory, CEO of AdventHealth’s East Florida Division, touted the opening of the medical building and the plans for the expansion of the hospital. She said the expansion of the hospital “will increase the community’s access to world-class, patient-centered care.”\n\n“Now, as we embark on this new expansion project, patients will soon have even greater access to high-quality care close to home,” Gregory said in a statement.\n\nAdventHealth officials note that the expansion of the hospital is being designed to accommodate additional growth. The system said the project will allow for more inpatient beds and surgical suites in the future.\n\nDavid Weis, president and CEO of AdventHealth Daytona Beach and the East Volusia Market, highlighted the potential for additional expansion of the hospital. He also noted a “high volume of patients” seeking care.\n\n“Meticulously crafted, this multi-phased plan is extensive and answers a great need as it is designed to accommodate the on-going growth within East Volusia County,” Weis said in a statement.\n\nPlanning for growth seems like a safe bet. Daytona Beach's population rose to about 78,000 in 2022, an increase of 8.9% since 2020, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Volusia County, home to Daytona Beach, is also seeing substantial growth, as the county population topped 590,000 in 2023, a 6.7% increase since 2020.\n\nAs hospitals expand, many systems are designing their facilities not just to meet immediate needs, but to accommodate future growth.\n\nAs Mayo Clinic develops its plans for a $5 billion transformation of its main campus, the health system is designing buildings that can be expanded vertically. The Mayo Clinic project includes two 9-story buildings, but those buildings will also be able to grow an additional 9 stories higher.\n\nAdventHealth opened the Daytona Beach hospital in 2009, replacing a 42-year-old facility. The system built the hospital for $270 million 15 years ago, but illustrating rising prices, the expansion price tag looks to be $50 million less than the cost of the original construction.\n\nAdventHealth, a faith-based, nonprofit system, is based in Altamonte Springs, Florida, and operates 52 hospitals in nine states.",

      "# [The First Rainbow: A Historic Rolex Daytona Set to Make History by Francesco Bortolan on 2024-10-28](https://blog.watchanalytics.io/p/the-first-rainbow-a-historic-rolex)\nLess than two weeks to go until the Reloaded: The Rebirth of Mechanical Watchmaking, 1980-1999 auction on November 8, 2024, where Phillips will auction a piece that promises to make history. This is the very first Rolex Daytona \"Rainbow,\" a unique specimen that predates the modern version unveiled at Baselworld in 2012 by nearly two decades. This timepiece, shrouded in mystery, is a genuine piece of horological history that enthusiasts were unaware of until Phillips surprised everyone by offering it at auction. This unique Daytona was commissioned for a client in the Middle East and remained hidden for years in a prestigious private collection, fueling rumors and legends about its existence.\n\nThe reference number is 16599SAAEC, where “SAAEC” translates to “Sapphire Arc-en-Ciel” in French, meaning “Rainbow Sapphire.” Starting with the arrangement of the rainbow on the bezel, we note that the color sequence is inverted compared to more recent Rainbow models, further emphasizing its uniqueness. In references from 2012 onward, the gradient begins with red and moves clockwise through shades of yellow, green, light blue, blue, and pink, while in this case, the sequence is exactly the opposite.Enhancing its aesthetics is a diamond pavé dial with blue sapphire hour markers.\n\nWe all know the importance of the Daytona Zenith in the history of this model and in watch collecting in general, and the fact that the very first Rainbow created by Rolex features the legendary caliber 4030 only adds to its prestige.\n\nBeyond its technical features, there are other reasons why this Daytona holds such great importance for Rolex. Traditionally, the Daytona line has been associated with motorsports and sporty chronographs. The sports watch was intended to serve strictly for its designed function. With the introduction of this gem-set version, Rolex not only redefined the concept of a luxury sports watch but also anticipated a trend that is now prevalent among various high-end watch brands, offering sporty watches adorned with precious stones. The 16599 thus represents Rolex’s avant-garde capabilities and foresight, qualities that have led the brand to become the most popular in the world.\n\nLooking at modern models, it is clear how the legacy of the \"Rainbow\" ref. 16599 has influenced the entire luxury watch sector. The fusion of aesthetics and functionality has made the Rainbow series an icon of the Rolex brand.
