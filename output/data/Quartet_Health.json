Everything from company holidays to vacation time constantly stripped back for non-leadership employees. Ask someone about the Juneteenth or maternity leave debates. It will tell you everything you need to know.\nContinue to claim \"start up\" status only because they are floundering for a strategy they can monetize. Total lack a consistent roadmap, because the strategy is changes yearly. \nEver-increasing workload shoveled on the few employees not laid off with no increase in compensation or titles. Employee stratification undervalues everyone except leadership. Use that that to refuse to compensate employees for the additional work demanded of them.\nCommitment to DEI is a lie, especially at the leadership level. All management hiring based on knowing the existing management team. Very white, hetero, male. Don't let the current female CEO fool you.\nHR team tries, but they are handcuffed by leadership. As long as an employee is \"producing\" or part of the leadership circle, bad behavior is excused. Repeat offenders sit on the leadership team, and the people that reported leave rather than fight a losing battle. \nIf you want real nightmares, know they laid off people on maternity/paternity leave, and laid off an employee that was literally weeks from her due date.

They lie, make up fake laws and only pay or reward upper management. THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AT ALL. \n\n\nThey continue to advertise “unlimited pto”. However this just isn’t true. If you’re a manager or above then yes, have at it. If you’re on the Care Navigation team or the Customer Support Staff who answer phones they will not give you time off. \nThey count literally everyday you are off and have a point system for those who they deem unworthy to use their “unlimited pto”. It’s now the WORST Pto plan I’ve had in 20 years in health care. \n\nThey have also taken our 15 holidays a year and reduced it to 6. Which is well below the National average for holidays allowed per year. \n\nThe management staff have absolutely no idea how difficult the roles are speaking to the patients on a daily basis. The burn out rate is very high due to their unrealistic metrics. Also- most patients are not cared for simply because they have the “wrong” insurance and Quartet doesn’t get paid. This place is a complete waste of time for most patients and employees. If you want to feel like the sludge at the bottom of a pond, join Quartet!",

The old strategy of the company wasn't profitable and being profitable is what pays the bill and ensures my paycheck. Apart of me is so fulfilled that Quartet is such an extremely mission driven company but it's not a nonprofit or a doctors office we are a business and we are here to offer a service. The bad reviews on here aren't false but they were at a different point in time in the companies journey. Things are really starting to look up. From the time I started in early 2021 the company has done a complete 360. I have extreme faith in the our new CEO and the new c-suite. I'm seeing transparency, structure, accountability, opportunity and reward that I've never seen before. Even though Quartet has been around a while it's still very much in a \"start-up\" phase with all the changes in strategy so keep that top of mind and take it into consideration if you're looking for a new role here. I came from an industry where work life balance was completely nonexistent and Quartet offers some of the best work life balance I've ever seen. Leadership has recently taken some huge steps to offer career planning tools and growth opportunities.",

The managers have one way meetings and don’t allow care navigators or care support specialists to have voices. The team members are not allowed to ask questions during meetings and are told that if they do have questions to please go to their managers in their one-on-one meetings in private. Meanwhile, all of the Care navigation members talk crap about the managers in private slack groups. The morale of the team is incredibly low, the turnover rate is extremely high, and the managers “have no idea why.” When I started with quartet, the benefits were amazing and the morale of the team was high. But, gradually, the benefits have been taken away from the care navigation team and the work life balance absolutely sucks. Oh, but don’t worry, Care navigation managers get to keep their unlimited PTO, salaried wages, and great benefits. It’s in anyone and everyone’s best interest to avoid this sinking ship of a company. They have a great mission but they do an absolutely horrible job of executing it to patients in need of mental health services. Also, the cost of living has gone up and there’s been an increase in job responsibilities for the care navigation team, yet no increase in salary. If you’re looking for a job, look elsewhere.

The company has completely gone down hill, it is not profitable and their revised business model does not work. So there is absolutely no job security. They just went through a second round of layoffs in the two years I've been at the company, meaning things have just been getting worst. Leadership does not care about employees or company culture. This is not a mission driven company any more, they DO NOT even care or prioritize their own employees mental health so please tell me how the heck would they be able to care about other's mental health ? This place is a dumpster fire and it's truly sad. I'd stay away as you may end up unemployed in a short amount of time given the state of the business.",

The bad reviews on here aren't false but they were at a different point in time in the companies journey. Things are really starting to look up.

I'm seeing transparency, structure, accountability, opportunity and reward that I've never seen before.

If you’re on the Care Navigation team or the Customer Support Staff who answer phones they will not give you time off. \nThey count literally everyday you are off and have a point system for those who they deem unworthy to use their “unlimited pto”. It’s now the WORST Pto plan I’ve had in 20 years in health care. \n\nThey have also taken our 15 holidays a year and reduced it to 6.

PHILADELPHIA, PA, January 29, 2025 — Today, we are excited to share that NeuroFlow has acquired Quartet Health, a value-based behavioral health care enablement company, expecting the deal to officially close by the end of the month. NeuroFlow’s technology and analytics platform integrates behavioral health into physical health workflows, enhances the enablement of care delivery and visibility into quality and risk management. This acquisition builds on our 2024 purchase of Owl Health, which brought advanced measurement-based care capabilities, and our recent partnership announcement with Intermountain Health to incorporate their proprietary analytics behavioral health risk model for proactive behavioral health management. Through this deal, NeuroFlow will continue supporting Quartet’s existing payer and provider customers which include fellow Philadelphia-based Independence Blue Cross, among others. Dr. Richard Snyder, Executive Vice President at Independence Blue Cross, shared, “We are proud of our collaboration with Quartet and excited to begin this next chapter with NeuroFlow, a fellow Philadelphia-based company, to help us in providing solutions for our network providers and case managers as well as the best care for our members.” The additional capabilities that Quartet brings include an extensive behavioral health provider network and referral management capabilities that will broaden NeuroFlow’s offerings to our existing customers which include a national footprint of payers, health systems, and the federal government. We are looking forward to partnering with Quartet’s customers in new ways and integrating NeuroFlow’s broad set of capabilities to improve the continuity and cost of care. Quartet CEO, Christina Mainelli said, “Quartet is a mission-driven company and putting our patients and customers first is of the utmost importance to us. As we thought about this next step for Quartet and how to increase our reach and impact, it was critically important to find a partner that is aligned with us in terms of mission and committed to driving better quality and affordability for more patients living with mental illness across the U.S. And we really feel like we have found that with NeuroFlow.” “This is an exciting moment for NeuroFlow, the current customers of Quartet Health, and the future of behavioral health,” said Chris Molaro, CEO of NeuroFlow. “By bringing Quartet and its customers onto our platform, we will accelerate our goal of making behavioral health care more accessible, personalized, and effective.” We are thrilled to welcome the Quartet team into our organization and look forward to creating powerful solutions to support our partners in achieving their goals and helping to create a happier and healthier world.
