Everything from company holidays to vacation time constantly stripped back for non-leadership employees. Ask someone about the Juneteenth or maternity leave debates. It will tell you everything you need to know.\nContinue to claim \"start up\" status only because they are floundering for a strategy they can monetize. Total lack a consistent roadmap, because the strategy is changes yearly. \nEver-increasing workload shoveled on the few employees not laid off with no increase in compensation or titles. Employee stratification undervalues everyone except leadership. Use that that to refuse to compensate employees for the additional work demanded of them.\nCommitment to DEI is a lie, especially at the leadership level. All management hiring based on knowing the existing management team. Very white, hetero, male. Don't let the current female CEO fool you.\nHR team tries, but they are handcuffed by leadership. As long as an employee is \"producing\" or part of the leadership circle, bad behavior is excused. Repeat offenders sit on the leadership team, and the people that reported leave rather than fight a losing battle. \nIf you want real nightmares, know they laid off people on maternity/paternity leave, and laid off an employee that was literally weeks from her due date. That is the leadership you're getting here.",

They have given us 9 days notice and we will go without full pay while they do this. Quartet Health is the WORST company I have ever worked for. They lie, make up fake laws and only pay or reward upper management. THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AT ALL. \n\n\nThey continue to advertise “unlimited pto”. However this just isn’t true. If you’re a manager or above then yes, have at it. If you’re on the Care Navigation team or the Customer Support Staff who answer phones they will not give you time off. \nThey count literally everyday you are off and have a point system for those who they deem unworthy to use their “unlimited pto”. It’s now the WORST Pto plan I’ve had in 20 years in health care. \n\nThey have also taken our 15 holidays a year and reduced it to 6. Which is well below the National average for holidays allowed per year. \n\nThe management staff have absolutely no idea how difficult the roles are speaking to the patients on a daily basis. The burn out rate is very high due to their unrealistic metrics. Also- most patients are not cared for simply because they have the “wrong” insurance and Quartet doesn’t get paid. This place is a complete waste of time for most patients and employees. If you want to feel like the sludge at the bottom of a pond, join Quartet!",

My experience at Quartet has had quite a few \"pros.\"\r\n\r\n- Smart and kind people across the board. Feeling like you can reach out to anyone with a question is paid lip service at other companies, but it's real here\r\n- Inspiring mission, evolving strategy. Shifting strategy is frustrating, but the new strategy is objectively clearer, and I understand how we plan to make money with the new changes. Before...not so much \r\n- New, interesting challenges. This probably isn't true for every role or team, but I think my day-to-day is rich with new experiences\r\n- I'm not patient-facing, so my view is limited, but I think we highlight our patient wins well and often. I love hearing about the indirect impact of my work on someone getting the care they need\r\n\r\nI feel like you could throw a stone and hit 10 other companies \"similar\" to Quartet (Cerebral, Ginger, Alma, etc). I like what we're doing differently, the people, and my work, so it's a great match for me. Maybe it's not for you, but I'd take other reviews with a grain of salt and find out for yourself.",

More management training for new managers has been implemented, and it'll be important to see how that makes things better. The stakes are high as we're working directly with people's health, which must be balanced against the desire of the company to iterate quickly and experiment with new approaches where many employees don't come in from the healthcare industry. Greater reliance of health/clinical domain knowledge will allow Quartet to make decisions more relevant and beneficial to users.",

This is not a mission driven company any more, they DO NOT even care or prioritize their own employees mental health so please tell me how the heck would they be able to care about other's mental health ?

The team members are not allowed to ask questions during meetings and are told that if they do have questions to please go to their managers in their one-on-one meetings in private. Meanwhile, all of the Care navigation members talk crap about the managers in private slack groups. The morale of the team is incredibly low, the turnover rate is extremely high, and the managers “have no idea why.” When I started with quartet, the benefits were amazing and the morale of the team was high. But, gradually, the benefits have been taken away from the care navigation team and the work life balance absolutely sucks. Oh, but don’t worry, Care navigation managers get to keep their unlimited PTO, salaried wages, and great benefits. It’s in anyone and everyone’s best interest to avoid this sinking ship of a company. They have a great mission but they do an absolutely horrible job of executing it to patients in need of mental health services. Also, the cost of living has gone up and there’s been an increase in job responsibilities for the care navigation team, yet no increase in salary. If you’re looking for a job, look elsewhere.

This probably isn't true for every role or team, but I think my day-to-day is rich with new experiences\r\n- I'm not patient-facing, so my view is limited, but I think we highlight our patient wins well and often.

Management changes, poorly thought out metrics and workflows, and a lot of the jobs themselves are horrible to do. Always understaffed due to high turnover. \r\n\r\n- Out of Touch Leadership: Great lip service but that's about it. Employees are miserable yet leadership thinks everything is great.

If you’re on the Care Navigation team or the Customer Support Staff who answer phones they will not give you time off. \nThey count literally everyday you are off and have a point system for those who they deem unworthy to use their “unlimited pto”. It’s now the WORST Pto plan I’ve had in 20 years in health care. \n\nThey have also taken our 15 holidays a year and reduced it to 6. Which is well below the National average for holidays allowed per year. \n\nThe management staff have absolutely no idea how difficult the roles are speaking to the patients on a daily basis. The burn out rate is very high due to their unrealistic metrics. Also- most patients are not cared for simply because they have the “wrong” insurance and Quartet doesn’t get paid. This place is a complete waste of time for most patients and employees. If you want to feel like the sludge at the bottom of a pond, join Quartet!",

Total lack a consistent roadmap, because the strategy is changes yearly. \nEver-increasing workload shoveled on the few employees not laid off with no increase in compensation or titles. Employee stratification undervalues everyone except leadership. Use that that to refuse to compensate employees for the additional work demanded of them.\nCommitment to DEI is a lie, especially at the leadership level. All management hiring based on knowing the existing management team. Very white, hetero, male. Don't let the current female CEO fool you.\nHR team tries, but they are handcuffed by leadership. As long as an employee is \"producing\" or part of the leadership circle, bad behavior is excused. Repeat offenders sit on the leadership team, and the people that reported leave rather than fight a losing battle. \nIf you want real nightmares, know they laid off people on maternity/paternity leave, and laid off an employee that was literally weeks from her due date.

      "# [Quartet Health Launches Innovative Whole Health Program to Improve Outcomes for Patients with Serious Mental Illness on 2024-03-19](https://www.quartethealth.com/perspectives/quartet-health-launches-innovative-whole-health-program-to-improve-outcomes-for-patients-with-serious-mental-illness/)\nPartnership with Clover Health Supports Underserved Patient Population With a New Whole-Person Care Delivery Solution\n\nQuartet Health, a leading value-based behavioral health care enablement and delivery company, today launched their Whole Health program in partnership with Clover Health, a physician enablement company, to better serve patients living with serious mental illnesses (SMI). The first-of-its-kind, whole-person care delivery solution is the only fully integrated physical and behavioral health model that takes accountability for the total cost of care (TCOC) risk on health plans’ most complex members, while also providing wraparound care services for a traditionally underserved patient population. The program was launched first in the New Jersey market.\n\n“Patients with serious mental illness often have worse outcomes and a lower life expectancy, and they experience a fragmented healthcare system that does not adequately address their behavioral, physical, and social needs” said Dr. Michael J. Lipp, Quartet Health’s Chief Medical Officer, and former CMO of the CMS Innovation Center. Clover Health’s members with SMI average at least four different chronic conditions, with more than five different providers prescribing medications. Additionally, one in five members with SMI did not see a primary care physician (PCP) last year, and one in three did not see a behavioral health provider. “Patients often struggle to get access to care, and the care they do receive is often uncoordinated. This program will provide care that is coordinated, comprehensive and convenient, at no additional cost to patients.”\n\nThe partnership with Clover Health gives Quartet Health the opportunity to address the unique needs of this complex patient population with a health equity-based focus, through 24/7 care access, medication support, mental and physical care coordination, as well as local community resource and transportation support. Care teams – both in-market and virtual – will be led by nurse practitioners, trained in both mental health and family medicine, along with care coordinators, social workers, case managers, therapists, peers, and supervising psychiatrists and internal medicine physicians.\n\n“For far too long, behavioral healthcare solutions for individuals living with SMI have not adequately accounted for the interconnectedness of both their physical and mental health needs,” said Christina Mainelli, Quartet Health CEO. “Patients are often forced to navigate an incredibly fragmented healthcare system, a system that fails to meet their needs, contributes to unnecessary hospitalizations and, ultimately, worse outcomes. That’s why it was so critical for us, in developing our Whole Health program, to take an approach that treats the whole person in a way that improves quality and patient outcomes, while also lowering the cost of care.”\n\n“We’re confident that additional behavioral health support for our SMI cohort will increase the quality of life for these members, while continuing to reduce unnecessary spend,” said Brady Priest, CEO of Clover Home Care.",
      "# [Clover Health Launches New Clinical Program in Partnership with Quartet Health to Address Serious Mental Illness by Clover Health Investments, Corp, Clover Health Investments on 2024-03-19](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/03/19/2848607/0/en/Clover-Health-Launches-New-Clinical-Program-in-Partnership-with-Quartet-Health-to-Address-Serious-Mental-Illness.html)\nFRANKLIN, Tenn., March 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, Clover Health (“Clover” or the “Company”) announced a partnership with Quartet Health, a value-based behavioral health care enablement and delivery company, to increase the support and resources provided to Clover members with serious mental illness (SMI) through the Company’s home-based care delivery unit, Clover Home Care.\n\nAs part of this partnership, Quartet will use its expert care teams to augment Clover Home Care’s capabilities. Quartet’s clinicians will also begin using the Clover Assistant platform to deliver care to the Clover patients under its care.\n\nClover Home Care addresses the needs of Clover’s most complex patient cohorts by delivering in-home care access, medication support, mental and physical care coordination, as well as local community resource and transportation support. Its care teams – both in-home and virtual – are led by physicians and nurse practitioners trained in both palliative care and family medicine, along with care coordinators, social workers, medical assistants and dedicated case managers.\n\nTo augment Clover Home Care’s robust care delivery model, and address one of Clover’s highest need cohorts, the Company is tapping into the behavioral health expertise of Quartet Health’s Whole Health program to provide additional support to members suffering from SMI. The Whole Health program is a unique, whole-person care delivery solution that delivers a fully-integrated physical and behavioral health model that will take accountability for the total cost of care (TCOC) on Clover Health’s most complex members, while also providing wraparound care services for a traditionally underserved patient population.\n\n“Patients with serious mental illness often have worse outcomes and a lower life expectancy, and they experience a fragmented healthcare system that does not adequately address their behavioral, physical, and social needs,” said Dr. Michael J. Lipp, Quartet Health’s Chief Medical Officer, and former CMO of the CMS Innovation Center. “Patients often struggle to get access to care, and the care they do receive is often uncoordinated. Layered on top of Clover Assistant's data-driven insights, this program will provide care that is coordinated, comprehensive and convenient, at no additional cost to patients.”\n\n“Through Clover Home Care, we are delivering impactful, proactive support to our members via a high-touch model built on top of the computing power of Clover Assistant. This allows our highly skilled and compassionate care teams to have a holistic view of each patient’s individual needs and address them accordingly,” said Brady Priest, CEO of Clover Home Care. “We’re confident that additional behavioral health support for our SMI cohort will increase the quality of life for these members, while continuing to reduce unnecessary spend.”\n\nIn addition to its care management capabilities, Clover's proprietary technology stack is essential in driving enrollment in disease-specific programs like Whole Health by Quartet. For example, Artificial intelligence (AI) embedded in Clover Assistant will identify members at highest risk of suffering from under-treated SMI, and identify increasing risk of hospitalizations for the SMI population.\n\nAs of January 1, Clover Home Care with Whole Health by Quartet Health is available to eligible members in New Jersey for no additional cost. For Clover members interested in learning more about the program, including eligibility, visit https://www.quartethealth.com/whole-health or call 888-528-7618.\n\nAbout Clover Health\n\nClover Health (Nasdaq: CLOV) is a physician enablement company committed to bringing access to great healthcare to everyone on Medicare. This includes a health equity-based focus on seniors who have historically lacked access to affordable, high-quality healthcare. Our strategy is powered by our software platform, Clover Assistant, which is designed to aggregate patient data from across the healthcare ecosystem to support clinical decision-making and improve health outcomes through the early identification and management of chronic disease.\n\nAbout Quartet Health\n\nQuartet is a leading value-based behavioral health care enablement and delivery company.
