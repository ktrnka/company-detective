Pursuant to these Privacy Rules, certain information, which receive special protections, should not be shared in communications facilitated by the Care Team Experience, including: psychotherapy notes, substance abuse records, and HIV/AIDS-related information.\n\nPsychotherapy notes are recorded by a mental health provider documenting or analyzing the contents of a conversation during a confidential individual, group, joint, or family session. Quartet does not permit such notes to be communicated in order to protect your patient’s privacy.\n\nSubstance abuse records from “Part 2” federally assisted treatment programs require an additional level of consent for disclosure and Quartet is not responsible for obtaining the requisite consent from clients.

No one’s experience with mental health is the same – different people have different needs, not just clinically, but in terms of access, too.\n\nGetting people the mental health care they need calls for a range of mental health care options. Below, you can learn more about the care options* available through Quartet.\n\nTherapy\n\nA therapist helps you to talk through your thoughts and feelings. This may be related to handling difficult experiences, solving problems, changing behavior or learning how to manage stress.\n\nTherapy sessions are usually offered weekly for 45-60 minutes, and can either be in-person or virtual. Virtual sessions can be over the phone or video conferencing. How long you choose to attend therapy will vary depending on your individual needs and goals.\n\nPsychiatry\n\nA psychiatrist is a doctor who is trained and specializes in treating mental health conditions using medication. Psychiatrists will talk through your symptoms, create a treatment plan, explain medication options, and keep track of your progress.\n\nPsychiatry appointments may be in-person or virtual, depending on the patient. Virtual sessions can be over the phone or video conferencing. First appointments may be between 45-60 minutes and follow up appointments are shorter and less frequent. Many people who see a psychiatrist also see a therapist.\n\nDigital Options\n\nOnline programs allow you to access care wherever you are, at your convenience and help you manage symptoms like stress, anxiety, or sadness using tools that help you change behaviors and improve your outlook. These programs are goal-oriented and can be done on your own or with the support of an optional coach. Online programs are often accessible by phone, computer or tablet.\n\n*The mental health care options available to you will depend on your clinical needs, preferences, and insurance. Policies regarding in-person or virtual care are subject to change, and it is recommended that you verify coverage with your insurance plan.",

No one cares enough about the company or culture to try.\nManagement decreases benefits about every 6 months. Raises are paltry. Everything from company holidays to vacation time constantly stripped back for non-leadership employees. Ask someone about the Juneteenth or maternity leave debates. It will tell you everything you need to know.\nContinue to claim \"start up\" status only because they are floundering for a strategy they can monetize. Total lack a consistent roadmap, because the strategy is changes yearly. \nEver-increasing workload shoveled on the few employees not laid off with no increase in compensation or titles. Employee stratification undervalues everyone except leadership. Use that that to refuse to compensate employees for the additional work demanded of them.\nCommitment to DEI is a lie, especially at the leadership level. All management hiring based on knowing the existing management team. Very white, hetero, male. Don't let the current female CEO fool you.\nHR team tries, but they are handcuffed by leadership. As long as an employee is \"producing\" or part of the leadership circle, bad behavior is excused. Repeat offenders sit on the leadership team, and the people that reported leave rather than fight a losing battle. \nIf you want real nightmares, know they laid off people on maternity/paternity leave, and laid off an employee that was literally weeks from her due date. That is the leadership you're getting here.",

Management changes, poorly thought out metrics and workflows, and a lot of the jobs themselves are horrible to do. Always understaffed due to high turnover. \r\n\r\n- Out of Touch Leadership: Great lip service but that's about it. Employees are miserable yet leadership thinks everything is great.

They are very defensive when faced with it, and I have heard many in the C suite laugh at how people at Quartet are \"too sensitive\" or \"get offended by everything.\" They blame people for being unhappy and insist that's why the culture is bad.\r\n-Decision makers do not have enough of a clinical background or lens to be successful in this type of company. When trying to figure out why patients aren't getting to care, they ignore the real reasons because they just want the quick fixes. They don't want to invest in fixing the tech or in making a positive experience for patients or providers. They just want to find the easiest, fastest thing they can present as a \"solution\" to investors and customers\r\n-Leaders say to follow the data, but when presented with data that contradicts what they want to hear, the response is \"Are you sure that's what it says? Let's pull it differently\" until it aligns with their expectations.\r\n\r\nIt makes sense why leadership had to change and why Quartet focuses on just getting acquired. But they are so incredibly top heavy and filled with middle managers that I don't feel confident the company will reach that goal. They prioritize hiring old coworkers from Aspire to fill leadership roles, which is not only frustrating from a nepotism standpoint but it also means no opportunities for advancement for people who have been with the company and want to actually grow in their career. \r\n\r\nUnless you are coming from their white boys club in Nashville, I would not recommend joining at this time. Most of us are only still here while we actively look for other jobs.",

Feeling like you can reach out to anyone with a question is paid lip service at other companies, but it's real here\r\n- Inspiring mission, evolving strategy. Shifting strategy is frustrating, but the new strategy is objectively clearer, and I understand how we plan to make money with the new changes. Before...not so much \r\n- New, interesting challenges. This probably isn't true for every role or team, but I think my day-to-day is rich with new experiences\r\n- I'm not patient-facing, so my view is limited, but I think we highlight our patient wins well and often. I love hearing about the indirect impact of my work on someone getting the care they need\r\n\r\nI feel like you could throw a stone and hit 10 other companies \"similar\" to Quartet (Cerebral, Ginger, Alma, etc). I like what we're doing differently, the people, and my work, so it's a great match for me. Maybe it's not for you, but I'd take other reviews with a grain of salt and find out for yourself.",

I was coming in brand new trying to adjust to everything and was ultimately let go because I could not keep my head above the water (unrealistic way of getting through the patient call logs and turnaround time).

Let's break this down for the palate, shall we?\n\nLook, accountability is difficult for the ego. You have to chew through and acknowledge the mistake, the oversight, the lack of research, the lack of innovation, the repeating of mistakes and failed initiatives, the willful neglect of user feedback, the pushing out of subject matter experts, the nepotism, the rapid career acceleration of friends over qualified candidates, the lack of communication, the close door decision making that lead to layoffs and a company reorg that had people taken from roles they were exceedingly well qualified for and putting them into ones that were in totally different fields, the lack meaningful feedback loops, the redefining of KPIs every quartet to spin a success story, the...oh...yeah there is a lot to chew through here. \n\nHmmm, I guess we can just say that accountability starts at the top and in my 5 years I saw its presence dwindle into non-existence. Don't worry though, they'll send out a survey to learn more about why surveys don't lead to impactful changes.\n\nThe inappropriate behavior is hard to break down here, so I'll simply say that I took my fiancée to one work event, never again. Need to say more? No I do not.\n\nFeedback is more a confirmation bias loop and if you're not part of the inner circle you will be stone walled from any meaningful platform to share concerns and it'll stunt your career progress. At Quartet who you know matters more than performance or competence.\n\nThere's a lot more complexity to the soup, huh? I hope by now you've spat it out, complained to the waiter, asked to see the manager, and know with conviction this ain't the place to dine. You can read from other reviewers, but be warned the current staff like to write their own and claim they have world famous matzoballs. I am not sure the health department would even consider it human food....and do you really want to find out for yourself when this market is exploding with new health tech companies and there are several, attractive competitors to consider?",

You can nibble into some great skill development areas and have freedom to laterally change teams, if you have a supportive manager. However, this will be marred by dysfunctional processes, broken departments, defeated colleagues, an incoherent and always changing business strategy, and an inner circle that makes life miserable for everyone in their wake. \n\nEverything you could learn at Quartet can be found in \"The Hard Thing About Hard Things\" or \"Why the Mighty Fall\". Go to your local book store and check out books on failed leadership, iteration, innovation, and accountability. You'll come out learning everything you would have gleaned here while enjoying life at a functional start-up building your professional equity in a meaningful way.\n\nDon't get swayed by the seasoning of \"this is a difficult problem we're trying to solve\" or the spices of \"we've learned a lot along the way\". As a five year vet at Quartet what they learned was how to reuse the same talk track after every failure. \n\nThe mission meant the world to me as someone who lost loved ones to suicide, addiction, and domestic violence. Quartet will exploit your goodwill and dedication to pawn a quick buck on a doomed to fail business model. Trust me, this soup is served to burn your mouth and make you numb to sensation so you just trust them when they say \"This is good soup\". It ain't!",

They have given us 9 days notice and we will go without full pay while they do this. Quartet Health is the WORST company I have ever worked for. They lie, make up fake laws and only pay or reward upper management. THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AT ALL. \n\n\nThey continue to advertise “unlimited pto”. However this just isn’t true. If you’re a manager or above then yes, have at it. If you’re on the Care Navigation team or the Customer Support Staff who answer phones they will not give you time off. \nThey count literally everyday you are off and have a point system for those who they deem unworthy to use their “unlimited pto”. It’s now the WORST Pto plan I’ve had in 20 years in health care. \n\nThey have also taken our 15 holidays a year and reduced it to 6. Which is well below the National average for holidays allowed per year. \n\nThe management staff have absolutely no idea how difficult the roles are speaking to the patients on a daily basis. The burn out rate is very high due to their unrealistic metrics. Also- most patients are not cared for simply because they have the “wrong” insurance and Quartet doesn’t get paid. This place is a complete waste of time for most patients and employees. If you want to feel like the sludge at the bottom of a pond, join Quartet!",

They just went through a second round of layoffs in the two years I've been at the company, meaning things have just been getting worst. Leadership does not care about employees or company culture. This is not a mission driven company any more, they DO NOT even care or prioritize their own employees mental health so please tell me how the heck would they be able to care about other's mental health ? This place is a dumpster fire and it's truly sad. I'd stay away as you may end up unemployed in a short amount of time given the state of the business.",

The managers have one way meetings and don’t allow care navigators or care support specialists to have voices. The team members are not allowed to ask questions during meetings and are told that if they do have questions to please go to their managers in their one-on-one meetings in private. Meanwhile, all of the Care navigation members talk crap about the managers in private slack groups. The morale of the team is incredibly low, the turnover rate is extremely high, and the managers “have no idea why.” When I started with quartet, the benefits were amazing and the morale of the team was high. But, gradually, the benefits have been taken away from the care navigation team and the work life balance absolutely sucks. Oh, but don’t worry, Care navigation managers get to keep their unlimited PTO, salaried wages, and great benefits. It’s in anyone and everyone’s best interest to avoid this sinking ship of a company. They have a great mission but they do an absolutely horrible job of executing it to patients in need of mental health services. Also, the cost of living has gone up and there’s been an increase in job responsibilities for the care navigation team, yet no increase in salary. If you’re looking for a job, look elsewhere.

They are very defensive when faced with it, and I have heard many in the C suite laugh at how people at Quartet are \"too sensitive\" or \"get offended by everything.\" They blame people for being unhappy and insist that's why the culture is bad.\r\n-Decision makers do not have enough of a clinical background or lens to be successful in this type of company. When trying to figure out why patients aren't getting to care, they ignore the real reasons because they just want the quick fixes. They don't want to invest in fixing the tech or in making a positive experience for patients or providers. They just want to find the easiest, fastest thing they can present as a \"solution\" to investors and customers\r\n-Leaders say to follow the data, but when presented with data that contradicts what they want to hear, the response is \"Are you sure that's what it says? Let's pull it differently\" until it aligns with their expectations.\r\n\r\nIt makes sense why leadership had to change and why Quartet focuses on just getting acquired. But they are so incredibly top heavy and filled with middle managers that I don't feel confident the company will reach that goal. They prioritize hiring old coworkers from Aspire to fill leadership roles, which is not only frustrating from a nepotism standpoint but it also means no opportunities for advancement for people who have been with the company and want to actually grow in their career. \r\n\r\nUnless you are coming from their white boys club in Nashville, I would not recommend joining at this time.

Let's break this down for the palate, shall we?\n\nLook, accountability is difficult for the ego. You have to chew through and acknowledge the mistake, the oversight, the lack of research, the lack of innovation, the repeating of mistakes and failed initiatives, the willful neglect of user feedback, the pushing out of subject matter experts, the nepotism, the rapid career acceleration of friends over qualified candidates, the lack of communication, the close door decision making that lead to layoffs and a company reorg that had people taken from roles they were exceedingly well qualified for and putting them into ones that were in totally different fields, the lack meaningful feedback loops, the redefining of KPIs every quartet to spin a success story, the...oh...yeah there is a lot to chew through here. \n\nHmmm, I guess we can just say that accountability starts at the top and in my 5 years I saw its presence dwindle into non-existence. Don't worry though, they'll send out a survey to learn more about why surveys don't lead to impactful changes.\n\nThe inappropriate behavior is hard to break down here, so I'll simply say that I took my fiancée to one work event, never again. Need to say more? No I do not.\n\nFeedback is more a confirmation bias loop and if you're not part of the inner circle you will be stone walled from any meaningful platform to share concerns and it'll stunt your career progress. At Quartet who you know matters more than performance or competence.\n\nThere's a lot more complexity to the soup, huh? I hope by now you've spat it out, complained to the waiter, asked to see the manager, and know with conviction this ain't the place to dine. You can read from other reviewers, but be warned the current staff like to write their own and claim they have world famous matzoballs. I am not sure the health department would even consider it human food....and do you really want to find out for yourself when this market is exploding with new health tech companies and there are several, attractive competitors to consider?",

However, this will be marred by dysfunctional processes, broken departments, defeated colleagues, an incoherent and always changing business strategy, and an inner circle that makes life miserable for everyone in their wake. \n\nEverything you could learn at Quartet can be found in \"The Hard Thing About Hard Things\" or \"Why the Mighty Fall\". Go to your local book store and check out books on failed leadership, iteration, innovation, and accountability. You'll come out learning everything you would have gleaned here while enjoying life at a functional start-up building your professional equity in a meaningful way.\n\nDon't get swayed by the seasoning of \"this is a difficult problem we're trying to solve\" or the spices of \"we've learned a lot along the way\". As a five year vet at Quartet what they learned was how to reuse the same talk track after every failure. \n\nThe mission meant the world to me as someone who lost loved ones to suicide, addiction, and domestic violence. Quartet will exploit your goodwill and dedication to pawn a quick buck on a doomed to fail business model. Trust me, this soup is served to burn your mouth and make you numb to sensation so you just trust them when they say \"This is good soup\". It ain't!",

If you’re on the Care Navigation team or the Customer Support Staff who answer phones they will not give you time off. \nThey count literally everyday you are off and have a point system for those who they deem unworthy to use their “unlimited pto”. It’s now the WORST Pto plan I’ve had in 20 years in health care. \n\nThey have also taken our 15 holidays a year and reduced it to 6.

      "# [Clover Health, Quartet launch whole health program to address mental illness in seniors on 2024-03-20](https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/clover-health-quartet-launch-whole-health-program-address-mental-illness-seniors)\nTennessee-based insurtech provider Clover Health announced a partnership with mental and behavioral health platform Quartet Health, which will bring value-based behavioral healthcare to Clover members with severe mental illness through Clover Home Care.\n\nClover Home Care delivers care access, medication support, mental and physical care coordination, and community resources to seniors. Clover supports Medicare Advantage plans.\n\nQuartet’s Whole Health will add in-person or virtual therapy or psychiatry, plus self-guided programs to Clover’s offerings.\n\nThe service matches patients with mental health professionals based on preferences, needs and insurance. Providers can also refer patients to the service.\n\nQuartet Clinicians will use the Clover Assistant platform, an AI tool that aggregates data to help health providers make decisions regarding chronic conditions. Their platform now includes offerings to help individuals with serious mental illness.\n\n\"Patients are often forced to navigate an incredibly fragmented healthcare system, a system that fails to meet their needs, contributes to unnecessary hospitalizations and, ultimately, worse outcomes. That’s why it was so critical for us, in developing our Whole Health program, to take an approach that treats the whole person in a way that improves quality and patient outcomes, while also lowering the cost of care,\" Christina Mainelli, CEO of Quartet Health, told MobiHealthNews in an email.\n\nTHE LARGER TREND\n\nIn December of 2021, Quartet Health announced it acquired fellow virtual mental health company InnovaTel Telepsychiatry. The acquisition enabled Quartet to grow capacity and delivery capabilities.\n\nThe announcement came days after a $60 million funding round and partnership announcement with Independence Health Group. The deal allowed Quartet to grow its patient identification tools and expand its ability to support additional conditions.\n\nLast year, Clover Health settled multiple lawsuits that alleged the insurtech company was under active investigation when it went public in 2021.\n\nThe same year, Clover avoided a stock delisting – after regaining compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of closing at $1 or more per share for at least 10 consecutive days. At the time this article was published, Clover was trading on the NASDAQ at $0.88 per share.\n\nIn December, Clover Health elected to exit the Center for Medicaid and Medicaid Services ACO REACH program, which supports care delivery and coordination for people in underserved communities.",
      "# [Quartet Health Launches Innovative Whole Health Program to Improve Outcomes for Patients with Serious Mental Illness on 2024-03-19](https://www.quartethealth.com/perspectives/quartet-health-launches-innovative-whole-health-program-to-improve-outcomes-for-patients-with-serious-mental-illness/)\nPartnership with Clover Health Supports Underserved Patient Population With a New Whole-Person Care Delivery Solution\n\nQuartet Health, a leading value-based behavioral health care enablement and delivery company, today launched their Whole Health program in partnership with Clover Health, a physician enablement company, to better serve patients living with serious mental illnesses (SMI). The first-of-its-kind, whole-person care delivery solution is the only fully integrated physical and behavioral health model that takes accountability for the total cost of care (TCOC) risk on health plans’ most complex members, while also providing wraparound care services for a traditionally underserved patient population. The program was launched first in the New Jersey market.\n\n“Patients with serious mental illness often have worse outcomes and a lower life expectancy, and they experience a fragmented healthcare system that does not adequately address their behavioral, physical, and social needs” said Dr. Michael J. Lipp, Quartet Health’s Chief Medical Officer, and former CMO of the CMS Innovation Center. Clover Health’s members with SMI average at least four different chronic conditions, with more than five different providers prescribing medications. Additionally, one in five members with SMI did not see a primary care physician (PCP) last year, and one in three did not see a behavioral health provider. “Patients often struggle to get access to care, and the care they do receive is often uncoordinated. This program will provide care that is coordinated, comprehensive and convenient, at no additional cost to patients.”\n\nThe partnership with Clover Health gives Quartet Health the opportunity to address the unique needs of this complex patient population with a health equity-based focus, through 24/7 care access, medication support, mental and physical care coordination, as well as local community resource and transportation support. Care teams – both in-market and virtual – will be led by nurse practitioners, trained in both mental health and family medicine, along with care coordinators, social workers, case managers, therapists, peers, and supervising psychiatrists and internal medicine physicians.\n\n“For far too long, behavioral healthcare solutions for individuals living with SMI have not adequately accounted for the interconnectedness of both their physical and mental health needs,” said Christina Mainelli, Quartet Health CEO. “Patients are often forced to navigate an incredibly fragmented healthcare system, a system that fails to meet their needs, contributes to unnecessary hospitalizations and, ultimately, worse outcomes. That’s why it was so critical for us, in developing our Whole Health program, to take an approach that treats the whole person in a way that improves quality and patient outcomes, while also lowering the cost of care.”\n\n“We’re confident that additional behavioral health support for our SMI cohort will increase the quality of life for these members, while continuing to reduce unnecessary spend,” said Brady Priest, CEO of Clover Home Care.",
      "# [Quartet Health Company Overview, Contact Details & Competitors](https://leadiq.com/c/quartet-health/5a1d98992300005200874388)\nWhole Health Program Launch Quartet Health recently launched the Whole Health program, offering a comprehensive solution addressing behavioral, physical, and social determinants of health challenges. This initiative presents an opportunity for collaboration with healthcare providers and institutions focused on holistic patient care.\n\nVirtual Clinic Expansion With the successful launch of a virtual clinic specializing in treating patients with moderate and serious mental illness, Quartet Health demonstrates a commitment to innovative care delivery. Leveraging this virtual care model can open doors for partnerships with telehealth service providers and health systems aiming to enhance mental health services.\n\nMarket-Leading Care Delivery Quartet Health is actively developing market-leading care delivery capabilities, positioning itself as a key player in the mental health care landscape. This presents an opportunity for collaboration with health insurance plans and organizations seeking advanced care solutions.\n\nNew Executive Team Recent key executive hires, including the CEO and Chief Clinical Strategy & Quality Officer, underscore Quartet Health's focus on clinical excellence.

As the demand for behavioral health services within our communities continues to grow, Emily and her team will help to ensure our patients are receiving the best care possible. We are pleased that through our partnership with Acadia, we were able to find an executive of Emily’s caliber with roots in Michigan to lead this hospital.”\n\nThe hospital is expected to open at the end of 2024.\n\nAccanto announces new chief people officer\n\nEating disorder provider Accanto has named Katy Kowalsky its new chief people officer.\n\nAccanto is the parent company of the Emily Program, Veritas Collaborative and Gather Behavioral Health.\n\nKowalsky joined Accanto in April of 2023 as HR director.

      "# [A Whole-Person Approach to Mental Health by Christina Mainelli on 2024-04-08](https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/whole-person-approach-to-mental-health)\nQ: What is the scale of the mental health need in the U.S.?\n\nIt’s estimated that more than one in five adults live with a mental illness. And if you add addiction—substance use disorder—that number gets much larger. It’s also pretty alarming that 55% of adults with mental illness go untreated. That’s devastating for those individuals and their families and friends. There are impacts on productivity, employment, even lifespan, and for society there’s lost economic vitality.\n\nFor adults with serious mental illness—think bipolar, schizophrenia, PTSD, major depressive disorder—there are even greater impacts. These individuals often have multiple comorbid conditions and worse health outcomes. Forty to fifty percent of this population also has a substance use disorder.\n\nAdditionally, the impact of mental illness on kids is staggering. Over half of adolescents have had a mental health issue or mental illness. Kids with a mental illness are two times more likely to drop out of school. Suicide is the second leading cause of death for adolescents as a whole and the leading cause of death for 14- and 15-year-olds.\n\nQ: What’s keeping people from getting the care they need?\n\nI think of three major issues that need to be addressed: access, quality, and the fragmentation of the delivery system.\n\nOne way to think of access is simply getting an appointment. You hear about wait times of weeks or months for people struggling with high acuity concerns—meaning their condition may be serious and could benefit from immediate care. The average wait time to see a psychiatrist is 25 days, and it can be up to 90 days. That’s a huge issue. Generally accepted standards include speed to care within 10 days for routine needs, within 48 hours for urgent needs, and within 6 hours for those in non-life-threatening crisis.\n\nFrom a business perspective, access is largely a supply and a matching issue. Almost half of the U.S. population, 164 million people, live in designated mental health professional shortage areas. To bring this to life, in Massachusetts, there’s one behavioral health clinician for every 150 people. In Alabama, there’s one behavioral health clinician for every 920 people. Essentially, in Alabama, there’s simply not enough supply, while in Massachusetts access challenges have more to do with matching the right provider to the patient.\n\nIt’s a very personal experience to obtain mental health care; we want a clinician who understands our circumstances. We may feel more comfortable with someone who “looks like us” in terms of age, race, religion, language, or gender. To fully address access, we need to support patients in getting connected or “matched” to the right behavioral healthcare clinician, and we need clinicians that reflect the complexion of our population as part of addressing health equity issues.\n\nQ: What about quality?\n\nDelivering high quality care that achieves the best outcomes for patients is critical, but significant variation remains in adherence to evidenced based care and in treatment outcomes across care settings, providers, and geographies. There are multiple contributing factors, including training, reimbursement models, and impact of health disparities which need to be addressed both on the healthcare delivery side as well as from a policy perspective.\n\nQ: The third issue you noted was fragmentation.\n\nFragmentation between physical and behavioral healthcare is a huge problem—the more we learn about mental health care, the clearer it is that physical health can be a large determinant of mental health and vice versa.\n\nThere has been progress addressing fragmentation as demonstrated by collaborative care models and related codes, and most recently a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services announcement around Integrated Health Models aimed at advancing holistic care. However, there is still a huge need for a formalized structure that not just enables but also incentivizes primary care doctors to connect with behavioral health specialists.\n\nImagine you’re a primary care physician in a practice seeing patients every 12 to 15 minutes, and someone presents with a mental health issue. It may not be clear how acute the patient is or how serious the issue is. What’s the appropriate treatment pathway? Who should you refer the patient to? It’s not obvious—or efficient to act on—in today’s clinical world.\n\nI often hear that physical health providers are reticent to treat individuals with serious mental illness. Why? Because patients with these conditions often have a complex combination of physical, behavioral, and social health needs.\n\nThere’s a lack of aligned incentives that would enable physical health providers to take on these patients, work with the mental health provider on a treatment plan that addresses all health needs, and engage in an ongoing exchange of information with the patient and the mental health provider about how the patient is progressing.\n\nAll of these things combined contribute to a lack of connectivity between the physical and behavioral health provider. It also creates a confusing and fragmented experience for the patient.\n\nQ: How does Quartet Health work?\n\nQuartet is both a technology platform and a direct provider of patient care. On our digital platform, we are connected to over 10,000 behavioral health providers that service up to 21 million patients. We also have a medical group that directly employs over 250 behavioral health clinicians who see over 500,000 patients a year.\n\nHere’s a real-life example: a 71-year-old female patient in Michigan used her phone to access our digital platform where she answered a few questions and selected what was most important to her in her care. She requested a female provider for virtual and in-person services to help address her anxiety. Within two hours, we reached out to the patient in Michigan and matched her to a provider. The provider contacted her within the hour, and she had her first appointment three days later.\n\nThe patient in Michigan is what we’d consider a good patient experience—within three hours the patient had an appointment set for within three days. This is using technology to help solve the access problem. We triage, match, and then provide care. At every step, we’re measuring outcomes to ensure quality.\n\nWhile this patient used the self-service option, primary care providers on our platform can also make a referral or have someone in the front office go through the initial matching process with a patient. Whether it’s the patient or the provider making the query, it passes right through our algorithms which help match the best behavioral health provider. That’s the connectivity between physical and behavioral health reducing fragmentation.\n\nThe name Quartet refers to what we see as the foundation of the physical health provider, the behavioral health provider, the payer, and the patient all working together.\n\nQ: Why not just operate a digital platform to connect patients to existing providers?\n\nMany behavioral healthcare companies were born out of the pandemic. A lot of them offer point solutions—they’re addressing one specific need. We’re starting to see consolidation in that part of the industry. We’re also seeing some of those companies fail due to lack of a robust business model. The ones that are surviving aren’t just offering point solutions, they’re taking on bigger industry-wide problems.\n\nAt Quartet, we felt that the digital platform alone wasn’t solving a big enough problem, so we made a strategic decision to deliver care ourselves. Quartet Medical Group delivers care in 30+ markets. We practice measurement-based care (MBC) to ensure our clinicians are using evidence-based medicine; we have close to 80% adherence to MBC, which is well above industry best practice. We also offer appointments within 48 hours for high acuity patients, and our outcomes are strong. Our data shows over 40% improvement in total cost of care for patients in our clinic. I don’t know of another company that connects physical health to behavioral health the way we do.\n\nUsing that integrated approach, we’ve just launched a new product. For patients with serious mental illness, we’re building a behavioral health home that delivers whole-person treatment—physical health, behavioral health, and social care, which is reimbursed in a value-based model. I worked closely with two of my classmates from Yale SOM to develop this solution: Tom Dow, who leads our medical economics team, and Michael Lipp, our chief medical officer. Getting to collaborate and innovate with Michael and Tom at Quartet has been one of the greatest gifts from the program.\n\nQ: Why did Quartet choose to focus its new offering on the seriously mentally ill population?\n\nIn the last few years, we’ve seen lots of new entrants in behavioral health—think Talkspace, Headspace, Calm. Most new entrants focus on those with mild mental illness. There are very few programs directed at the moderate to seriously mentally ill.\n\nThis is a patient population that really struggles. Their average lifespan is 15 to 17 years shorter. Often, they do not have access to physical or behavioral healthcare. And from an economic perspective, these are incredibly expensive patients because they require a lot of services and, if they don’t get those services, they end up in situations that require an emergency room or inpatient facility.\n\nI have absolute conviction that we must address the “whole person” in healthcare. I’ve spent over two decades in the field. I’ve worked on the physical health side. I’ve seen the difficulties and complexities of delivering care to patients. I’ve also done work focused on the social determinants of health. That’s why I know Quartet’s approach is an opportunity to improve experience and outcomes for these patients. This is a business opportunity because, in a value-based context, we can deliver higher quality care that lowers overall costs and provides better patient outcomes.\n\nQ: How does the program work?\n\nWe take total cost-of-care accountability. Our primary care and behavioral health clinicians provide care virtually and in person. We meet the patient where they are: in the hospital, in the home, in the community. We provide whatever service the patient needs, whether it’s physical health, behavioral health, or social services. We’re not saying, “Oh, this or that’s not covered.” We’re doing what we think is clinically appropriate for each patient because, at the end of the day, we are rewarded based on our clinical outcomes: Did we reduce cost of care? Did the patient’s health improve?\n\nValue-based care is a very impactful reimbursement model for this population because it aligns incentives. This population has complex needs, with nearly three comorbid conditions on average, and thus requires a payment model that reimburses for not just mental health services but treatment for the whole person. By treating all aspects of health, we can prevent acute events such as hospital admissions by ensuring access, quality, and continuity of care, which in turn lowers overall costs. And we can do this successfully because it’s one care delivery team working together.\n\nThis isn’t a short-term program; we stay with patients for as long as they need us. That could be 12 months or 18 months or it could be three years. We see up to a 30% to 40% total cost-of-care reduction while improving quality and patient experience. It’s early, but we’re seeing very good results to start. For example, we are seeing over 25% patient engagement in a tough to reach population, and over 95% are coming back for follow on appointments and visits. That is an early indicator of success.\n\nQ: How is mental health care usually paid for?\n\nToday, mental health is still primarily a fee-for-service game. If you’re fortunate enough to find a provider that’s in your network, you have a co-pay, but the lion’s share of individuals are using cash pay in order to get access to the mental health provider that they want on the timeline that they want.\n\nA lot of work has been done on mental health parity, which would ensure mental health issues are covered by insurance and that providers are available, but more work needs to be done to fully implement these programs with payers across the country.\n\nI know people who are paying up to $450 an hour to see a therapist in New York City. I don’t think that’s sustainable. It doesn’t solve the core issues at hand with respect to equitable access, quality, or fragmentation. For example, the fee-for-service world does not reimburse for treating the whole person. Services like transportation, wellness visits, or peer support are often not reimbursed, but they are critical to improving health outcomes and lowering overall costs. That’s why we’ve made the choice to work with both commercial and government payers, so the providers we make available to individuals are largely in-network choices, and why we’ve launched our value-based products to provide alternative payment models.\n\nQ: Who is your customer?\n\nWe have a patient-first culture and mentality. We are accountable to our patients, but often we get access to them through a payer, so at the end of the day, our customers are health plans, health systems, community mental health centers, and government payers.\n\nQ: Where do you see the field moving in the next five years?\n\nI think that we are going to see a lot more movement toward value-based care for behavioral health. Traditional fee-for-service does not work for whole-person care or for higher acuity populations—whether its mental health or substance use.\n\nI also absolutely think there’s a place for AI in behavioral healthcare. There’s work being done on patient intake, routine administrative tasks, and transcribing notes from sessions, all of which can help to tackle issues of supply by freeing up staff to focus on patient care.\n\nAI can also analyze vast datasets far more efficiently than humans. This capability can lead to earlier detection of diseases, help develop personalized treatment plans, and lead to better patient outcomes. It’s worth noting that for these efforts to be successful, they rely on high quality data, a multi-disciplinary team to develop and validate recommendations, and the protection of patient data and privacy.\n\nQ: Has your experience at Yale SOM shaped how you approach your work?\n\nI got a tremendous amount out of my Yale SOM experience. Because I chose the healthcare focus, my classmates all worked in healthcare, too, but they had expertise in other disciplines such as law, technology, or medicine. Their different points of view gave me a broader understanding of the many constituents in healthcare and the challenges and opportunities each faces, as well as the importance of the entire healthcare delivery system working together. This broader view and experience have made me a better problem solver, strategist, partner, and leader of people and organizations.",

      "# [Independence Blue Cross expands member options for faster access to behavioral health services, to support their whole health journey by Ajé King on 2024-09-17](https://news.ibx.com/behavioral-health-services/)\nIndependence Blue Cross (IBX) has expanded its covered behavioral health offerings, which include mental health and substance use disorder services and member programs, to better support members’ whole health. The offerings get members the type of care they need faster and give them a wider range of clinicians to choose from.\n\n“As part of our commitment to equitable whole-person health, we have prioritized expanding access to behavioral health care across our community. One of the things we did when looking at our members’ needs was to identify high quality providers, who can get our members quick access to appointments and the services that they need. We have also created mental health value-based programs to recognize our best providers and incentivize continuous improvement in the network,” said Dr. Rodrigo Cerdá, senior vice president of Health Services and chief medical officer at Independence Blue Cross.\n\nEnhancing members’ access to care\n\nMembers have access to a comprehensive and diverse behavioral health network as part of the expanded offerings. It gives members a wider range of services to choose from for a variety of conditions, including:\n\nGeneral mental and behavioral health.\n\nChildren, adolescent, and young adult services.\n\nSpecific conditions, such as eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, substance use disorders, and more.\n\nThe local options include 6,700 behavioral health practitioners in the Philadelphia five-county region who offer in person and virtual care. That is a 47 percent increase from the number of local providers that were in IBX’s network in 2022. More than 500 of the new providers are Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). The top two languages they speak are Spanish and Russian, the two most common languages requested by IBX members. This shows that IBX is working hard to make sure that people have access to health care from providers who are more likely to understand their culture and speak their language.\n\nIBX is also working to improve health equity in behavioral health by encouraging and compensating for depression screenings by all providers, not just those in the behavioral health field which should improve the observed disparity in behavioral health diagnosis and treatment.\n\nAdditionally, IBX offers an expanded set of virtual care options serving both local and out-of-area members, offering convenient access, and innovative care models. Included in these options are “Connect to Care” providers who can help members quickly access appointments with scheduling tools and live intake. These providers have approximately 4,000 appointments available per month and offer appointments in less than seven days. Members can choose from several providers, including but not limited to those focused on:\n\nGeneral mental health care: Grow Therapy, Thriveworks, Headway\n\nChildren, adolescents and young adults: Little Otter, Joon, Handspring Health, Blackbird Health\n\nCare for people with substance use disorders: Pelago, Ria Health, Pursue Care, Forge Health, Crossroads, New Life\n\nOther behavioral health specialty care: Equip Health, NOCD, Quartet Medical Group\n\nNavigating members to the right care when they need it\n\n“Health care is complex and navigating care can be overwhelming. This is especially true for people who are dealing with a mental health or substance use disorder condition,” said Diana Lehman, B.S.N., R.N., vice president of Case and Condition Management at Independence Blue Cross. “That’s why we have Behavioral Health Case Managers, Behavioral Health Customer Care Advocates, and a Clinical Triage Team available to help support members with all aspects of their care.”\n\nIBX Behavioral Health Case Managers are registered nurses, licensed social workers, and professional counselors who proactively identify members who may benefit from behavioral health services. They look at a member’s health history and their care patterns to identify risk levels and offer support. This support involves reaching out to members to help them access care, schedule follow-ups, and stay aligned with their care plans. By identifying unmet needs and supporting quicker access to integrated care, IBX is helping to close care gaps and improve total health. Since making Behavioral Health Case Managers available in 2022, IBX has been able to identify four times more members in need of behavioral health services.\n\nMembers also have access to care navigation services that are provided by specialized IBX Behavioral Health Customer Care Advocates and Licensed Behavioral Health professionals. The team works together to provide risk screening and guide members to the right care options based on their individual needs. High risk members are escalated to the IBX Clinical Triage Team who can identify priority needs, provide in the moment support, directly connect the member to care (via warm transfer or direct scheduling), and follow up to ensure safety and successful linkage. Care navigation services are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to provide members with rapid connection to the right care. Between April 2023 and June 2024, the team has helped more than 20,000 members connect to care. With the support of seamless connection and direct scheduling, members are receiving appointments within five days.\n\nOffering members additional support and tools:\n\nIBX members enrolled in fully insured health plans can get additional support from Quartet Health*, a company that matches them to mental health care that fits their needs, preferences, and is covered by their health insurance. In addition to its regular platform, Quartet Health has a Virtual Clinic that it launched in 2022 with IBX. The clinic, which focuses on treating the needs of patients with serious mental illness, has a patient appointment availability guarantee within 48 hours. IBX, as part of its strategic partnership with and investment in Quartet, offers these navigational services free to eligible members.\n\nThe company also gives members access to the Shatterproof* Treatment Atlas® tool. The tool helps people search and compare addiction treatment facilities to find high-quality care for themselves or their loved ones. Members also have coverage for mental health coaching by Teladoc Health*, a digital resource that offers personalized, evidence-based programs and dedicated support for a wide range of topics, including stress, depression, chronic pain, work-life balance, substance use, and anxiety.
