Due to the sensitivity of the information, this memo addresses what type of communication is appropriate between providers.\n\nThe HIPAA Privacy Rule and certain state and Federal rules (collectively, “Privacy Rules”) establish standards to protect patient health information. Pursuant to these Privacy Rules, certain information, which receive special protections, should not be shared in communications facilitated by the Care Team Experience, including: psychotherapy notes, substance abuse records, and HIV/AIDS-related information.\n\nPsychotherapy notes are recorded by a mental health provider documenting or analyzing the contents of a conversation during a confidential individual, group, joint, or family session. Quartet does not permit such notes to be communicated in order to protect your patient’s privacy.\n\nSubstance abuse records from “Part 2” federally assisted treatment programs require an additional level of consent for disclosure and Quartet is not responsible for obtaining the requisite consent from clients.

      "# [What Kind of Mental Health Care Options Can I Access Through Quartet? on 2020-10-08](https://www.quartethealth.com/resources/care-options/)\nAt Quartet, our vision is that one day, every person with a mental health condition will get the care they need. No one’s experience with mental health is the same – different people have different needs, not just clinically, but in terms of access, too.\n\nGetting people the mental health care they need calls for a range of mental health care options. Below, you can learn more about the care options* available through Quartet.\n\nTherapy\n\nA therapist helps you to talk through your thoughts and feelings. This may be related to handling difficult experiences, solving problems, changing behavior or learning how to manage stress.\n\nTherapy sessions are usually offered weekly for 45-60 minutes, and can either be in-person or virtual. Virtual sessions can be over the phone or video conferencing. How long you choose to attend therapy will vary depending on your individual needs and goals.\n\nPsychiatry\n\nA psychiatrist is a doctor who is trained and specializes in treating mental health conditions using medication. Psychiatrists will talk through your symptoms, create a treatment plan, explain medication options, and keep track of your progress.\n\nPsychiatry appointments may be in-person or virtual, depending on the patient. Virtual sessions can be over the phone or video conferencing. First appointments may be between 45-60 minutes and follow up appointments are shorter and less frequent. Many people who see a psychiatrist also see a therapist.\n\nDigital Options\n\nOnline programs allow you to access care wherever you are, at your convenience and help you manage symptoms like stress, anxiety, or sadness using tools that help you change behaviors and improve your outlook. These programs are goal-oriented and can be done on your own or with the support of an optional coach. Online programs are often accessible by phone, computer or tablet.\n\n*The mental health care options available to you will depend on your clinical needs, preferences, and insurance. Policies regarding in-person or virtual care are subject to change, and it is recommended that you verify coverage with your insurance plan.",

Also open to remote. They have Regence insurance, does anyone with Regence insurance recommend a therapist they personally use?

It really depends on your friend’s specific plan. With that said, this isn’t really the specific recommendation you’re asking for, but I have ADHD and do medication management via telehealth through ZoomCare with a provider up in Seattle.  I absolutely adore my DNP, and I’m confident their talk therapists are great too. I have an amazing therapist in Vancouver, but unfortunately she isn’t taking new clients.

There's a few behavioral health specific ones out there (Quartet Health, etc.). As a note, many that say they use AI don't actually use AI in any meaningful way.\n\nThese companies will have roles that touch healthcare (ie: Data Science, ML, Stats, some data eng, some backend eng) and roles which are more agnostic (CRUD backends, frontend, etc.). Most of the work is probably going to be no different from any other company out there. After all, if it's consumer facing they still need a web page, an app, backend to server data, etc.\n\nIf you want to be more in touch with the healthcare side then I'd recommend data engineering or machine learning roles.\n\n## Comment ID evoqkgj with +1 score by [(QmV6b3MgQm9p, Reddit, 2019-08-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ckjbb5/how_can_a_computer_scientist_contribute_to/evoqkgj/) (in reply to ID ckjbb5):\nRoche is hiring software engineers :)\n\n## Comment ID evoxjcq with +1 score by [(BoobRockets, Reddit, 2019-08-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ckjbb5/how_can_a_computer_scientist_contribute_to/evoxjcq/) (in reply to ID ckjbb5):\nLook into computational neuroscience.\n\n## Comment ID evp465u with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-08-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ckjbb5/how_can_a_computer_scientist_contribute_to/evp465u/) (in reply to ID ckjbb5):\nnuna.com\n\n## Comment ID evp97ki with +1 score by [(pacific_plywood, Reddit, 2019-08-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ckjbb5/how_can_a_computer_scientist_contribute_to/evp97ki/) (in reply to ID ckjbb5):\nLook through faculty at your nearest medical school (it may even have a dedicated bioinformatics department).

I've worked in several of them and contribute my perspective.\n\nA couple areas that I\"m aware of that could use more help:\n\n* Deep data analytics for drug research.  Pharmaceutical companies keep data for millions of molecules and the job of recognizing what could be useful as medicines is incredibly complicated.  Also, many scientists involved in the work, don't have a strong mathematical background.  This area does get a lot of attention and money, but it still seems under served to me.\n* Long Term Care systems.  Expert systems along with data analytics.  The medical needs of elderly patients are a low priority in the US.   There are lots of systems to track and manage patients, but not many actually improve the care of elderly patients.  The elderly generally only get medical care when a crisis occurs.  There's very little done to actually improve their overall health.  I've worked with systems that tracked a few factors for elderly diabetic patients that would monitor trends and get a physician involved to prevent a crisis instead of reacting to them.  I know 15 years ago, our problem was that there was very little profit in keeping the elderly healthy.  Not sure if this has changed, but the need is still there.\n\nThis is only my limited perspective, I know there are tons of other opportunities that I'm not aware of too.  \n\nIf I were looking for an internship I would start with either end of the spectrum of companies.  Either the large ones with lots of money & resources or the small startups that are in need of lots of help.  For the former you could start with this list:   [https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/features/top-pharmaceutical-companies/](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/features/top-pharmaceutical-companies/)For the latter:  [https://healthcareweekly.com/best-healthcare-startups-to-watch-for-in-2019/](https://healthcareweekly.com/best-healthcare-startups-to-watch-for-in-2019/)\n\n## Comment ID evpe3gp with +1 score by [(Twin_Nets_Jets, Reddit, 2019-08-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ckjbb5/how_can_a_computer_scientist_contribute_to/evpe3gp/) (in reply to ID ckjbb5):\nThere's a startup in San Francisco called Commure.

I also worry a lot of these data science jobs may devolve back into traditional Excel jockeying once senior management have moved onto the next business fad. \n\nWe also have a move towards more 'smart' medical devices and there's also a trend now of having phone apps for patients to compliment their medical products.\n\n## Comment ID evoybkt with +1 score by [(neuro-grey7, Reddit, 2019-08-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ckjbb5/how_can_a_computer_scientist_contribute_to/evoybkt/) (in reply to ID ckjbb5):\nCompanies like Cerner work primarily in healthcare tech.

Everything from company holidays to vacation time constantly stripped back for non-leadership employees. Ask someone about the Juneteenth or maternity leave debates. It will tell you everything you need to know.\nContinue to claim \"start up\" status only because they are floundering for a strategy they can monetize. Total lack a consistent roadmap, because the strategy is changes yearly. \nEver-increasing workload shoveled on the few employees not laid off with no increase in compensation or titles. Employee stratification undervalues everyone except leadership. Use that that to refuse to compensate employees for the additional work demanded of them.\nCommitment to DEI is a lie, especially at the leadership level. All management hiring based on knowing the existing management team. Very white, hetero, male. Don't let the current female CEO fool you.\nHR team tries, but they are handcuffed by leadership. As long as an employee is \"producing\" or part of the leadership circle, bad behavior is excused. Repeat offenders sit on the leadership team, and the people that reported leave rather than fight a losing battle. \nIf you want real nightmares, know they laid off people on maternity/paternity leave, and laid off an employee that was literally weeks from her due date.

They have given us 9 days notice and we will go without full pay while they do this. Quartet Health is the WORST company I have ever worked for. They lie, make up fake laws and only pay or reward upper management. THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AT ALL. \n\n\nThey continue to advertise “unlimited pto”. However this just isn’t true. If you’re a manager or above then yes, have at it. If you’re on the Care Navigation team or the Customer Support Staff who answer phones they will not give you time off. \nThey count literally everyday you are off and have a point system for those who they deem unworthy to use their “unlimited pto”. It’s now the WORST Pto plan I’ve had in 20 years in health care. \n\nThey have also taken our 15 holidays a year and reduced it to 6. Which is well below the National average for holidays allowed per year. \n\nThe management staff have absolutely no idea how difficult the roles are speaking to the patients on a daily basis. The burn out rate is very high due to their unrealistic metrics. Also- most patients are not cared for simply because they have the “wrong” insurance and Quartet doesn’t get paid. This place is a complete waste of time for most patients and employees. If you want to feel like the sludge at the bottom of a pond, join Quartet!",

Management changes, poorly thought out metrics and workflows, and a lot of the jobs themselves are horrible to do. Always understaffed due to high turnover. \r\n\r\n- Out of Touch Leadership: Great lip service but that's about it. Employees are miserable yet leadership thinks everything is great.

They are very defensive when faced with it, and I have heard many in the C suite laugh at how people at Quartet are \"too sensitive\" or \"get offended by everything.\" They blame people for being unhappy and insist that's why the culture is bad.\r\n-Decision makers do not have enough of a clinical background or lens to be successful in this type of company. When trying to figure out why patients aren't getting to care, they ignore the real reasons because they just want the quick fixes. They don't want to invest in fixing the tech or in making a positive experience for patients or providers. They just want to find the easiest, fastest thing they can present as a \"solution\" to investors and customers\r\n-Leaders say to follow the data, but when presented with data that contradicts what they want to hear, the response is \"Are you sure that's what it says? Let's pull it differently\" until it aligns with their expectations.\r\n\r\nIt makes sense why leadership had to change and why Quartet focuses on just getting acquired. But they are so incredibly top heavy and filled with middle managers that I don't feel confident the company will reach that goal. They prioritize hiring old coworkers from Aspire to fill leadership roles, which is not only frustrating from a nepotism standpoint but it also means no opportunities for advancement for people who have been with the company and want to actually grow in their career. \r\n\r\nUnless you are coming from their white boys club in Nashville, I would not recommend joining at this time. Most of us are only still here while we actively look for other jobs.",

Do NOT ignore all the negative reviews you have just read... Reach out to people who have previously worked at this company for feedback on their experience. The amount of talented people who have filtered out of this company in record speed should be a red flag not worth ignoring.\r\nI haven't even touched on the \"mission driven company\" - which would be more meaningful if they actually fulfilled the mission (ding ding, they aren't) nor is there a clear strategy to make it happen.",

Feeling like you can reach out to anyone with a question is paid lip service at other companies, but it's real here\r\n- Inspiring mission, evolving strategy. Shifting strategy is frustrating, but the new strategy is objectively clearer, and I understand how we plan to make money with the new changes. Before...not so much \r\n- New, interesting challenges. This probably isn't true for every role or team, but I think my day-to-day is rich with new experiences\r\n- I'm not patient-facing, so my view is limited, but I think we highlight our patient wins well and often. I love hearing about the indirect impact of my work on someone getting the care they need\r\n\r\nI feel like you could throw a stone and hit 10 other companies \"similar\" to Quartet (Cerebral, Ginger, Alma, etc). I like what we're doing differently, the people, and my work, so it's a great match for me. Maybe it's not for you, but I'd take other reviews with a grain of salt and find out for yourself.",

It's been a handful of years since so I do not not how it's operating currently, but management certainly did not take this pain point seriously as my counterparts were already familiar with the inner workings of the platform. I was coming in brand new trying to adjust to everything and was ultimately let go because I could not keep my head above the water (unrealistic way of getting through the patient call logs and turnaround time). Poorly mismanaged then and certainly paid undermarket. Was a blessing in disguise to be let go.",

They just went through a second round of layoffs in the two years I've been at the company, meaning things have just been getting worst. Leadership does not care about employees or company culture. This is not a mission driven company any more, they DO NOT even care or prioritize their own employees mental health so please tell me how the heck would they be able to care about other's mental health ? This place is a dumpster fire and it's truly sad. I'd stay away as you may end up unemployed in a short amount of time given the state of the business.",

          "pros": "Quartet has changed immensely over the past couple of months and the changes continue to happen. It's been hard and at first I was uncertain but the changes have been for the best. The old strategy of the company wasn't profitable and being profitable is what pays the bill and ensures my paycheck. Apart of me is so fulfilled that Quartet is such an extremely mission driven company but it's not a nonprofit or a doctors office we are a business and we are here to offer a service. The bad reviews on here aren't false but they were at a different point in time in the companies journey. Things are really starting to look up. From the time I started in early 2021 the company has done a complete 360. I have extreme faith in the our new CEO and the new c-suite. I'm seeing transparency, structure, accountability, opportunity and reward that I've never seen before. Even though Quartet has been around a while it's still very much in a \"start-up\" phase with all the changes in strategy so keep that top of mind and take it into consideration if you're looking for a new role here. I came from an industry where work life balance was completely nonexistent and Quartet offers some of the best work life balance I've ever seen. Leadership has recently taken some huge steps to offer career planning tools and growth opportunities.",

Meanwhile, all of the Care navigation members talk crap about the managers in private slack groups. The morale of the team is incredibly low, the turnover rate is extremely high, and the managers “have no idea why.” When I started with quartet, the benefits were amazing and the morale of the team was high. But, gradually, the benefits have been taken away from the care navigation team and the work life balance absolutely sucks. Oh, but don’t worry, Care navigation managers get to keep their unlimited PTO, salaried wages, and great benefits. It’s in anyone and everyone’s best interest to avoid this sinking ship of a company. They have a great mission but they do an absolutely horrible job of executing it to patients in need of mental health services. Also, the cost of living has gone up and there’s been an increase in job responsibilities for the care navigation team, yet no increase in salary. If you’re looking for a job, look elsewhere.

When trying to figure out why patients aren't getting to care, they ignore the real reasons because they just want the quick fixes. They don't want to invest in fixing the tech or in making a positive experience for patients or providers. They just want to find the easiest, fastest thing they can present as a \"solution\" to investors and customers\r\n-Leaders say to follow the data, but when presented with data that contradicts what they want to hear, the response is \"Are you sure that's what it says? Let's pull it differently\" until it aligns with their expectations.\r\n\r\nIt makes sense why leadership had to change and why Quartet focuses on just getting acquired. But they are so incredibly top heavy and filled with middle managers that I don't feel confident the company will reach that goal. They prioritize hiring old coworkers from Aspire to fill leadership roles, which is not only frustrating from a nepotism standpoint but it also means no opportunities for advancement for people who have been with the company and want to actually grow in their career. \r\n\r\nUnless you are coming from their white boys club in Nashville, I would not recommend joining at this time.

But, gradually, the benefits have been taken away from the care navigation team and the work life balance absolutely sucks. Oh, but don’t worry, Care navigation managers get to keep their unlimited PTO, salaried wages, and great benefits. It’s in anyone and everyone’s best interest to avoid this sinking ship of a company. They have a great mission but they do an absolutely horrible job of executing it to patients in need of mental health services. Also, the cost of living has gone up and there’s been an increase in job responsibilities for the care navigation team, yet no increase in salary. If you’re looking for a job, look elsewhere.

Everything from company holidays to vacation time constantly stripped back for non-leadership employees. Ask someone about the Juneteenth or maternity leave debates. It will tell you everything you need to know.\nContinue to claim \"start up\" status only because they are floundering for a strategy they can monetize. Total lack a consistent roadmap, because the strategy is changes yearly. \nEver-increasing workload shoveled on the few employees not laid off with no increase in compensation or titles. Employee stratification undervalues everyone except leadership. Use that that to refuse to compensate employees for the additional work demanded of them.\nCommitment to DEI is a lie, especially at the leadership level. All management hiring based on knowing the existing management team. Very white, hetero, male. Don't let the current female CEO fool you.\nHR team tries, but they are handcuffed by leadership. As long as an employee is \"producing\" or part of the leadership circle, bad behavior is excused. Repeat offenders sit on the leadership team, and the people that reported leave rather than fight a losing battle. \nIf you want real nightmares, know they laid off people on maternity/paternity leave, and laid off an employee that was literally weeks from her due date.

Clover supports Medicare Advantage plans.\n\nQuartet’s Whole Health will add in-person or virtual therapy or psychiatry, plus self-guided programs to Clover’s offerings.\n\nThe service matches patients with mental health professionals based on preferences, needs and insurance. Providers can also refer patients to the service.\n\nQuartet Clinicians will use the Clover Assistant platform, an AI tool that aggregates data to help health providers make decisions regarding chronic conditions. Their platform now includes offerings to help individuals with serious mental illness.\n\n\"Patients are often forced to navigate an incredibly fragmented healthcare system, a system that fails to meet their needs, contributes to unnecessary hospitalizations and, ultimately, worse outcomes. That’s why it was so critical for us, in developing our Whole Health program, to take an approach that treats the whole person in a way that improves quality and patient outcomes, while also lowering the cost of care,\" Christina Mainelli, CEO of Quartet Health, told MobiHealthNews in an email.\n\nTHE LARGER TREND\n\nIn December of 2021, Quartet Health announced it acquired fellow virtual mental health company InnovaTel Telepsychiatry. The acquisition enabled Quartet to grow capacity and delivery capabilities.\n\nThe announcement came days after a $60 million funding round and partnership announcement with Independence Health Group. The deal allowed Quartet to grow its patient identification tools and expand its ability to support additional conditions.\n\nLast year, Clover Health settled multiple lawsuits that alleged the insurtech company was under active investigation when it went public in 2021.\n\nThe same year, Clover avoided a stock delisting – after regaining compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of closing at $1 or more per share for at least 10 consecutive days. At the time this article was published, Clover was trading on the NASDAQ at $0.88 per share.\n\nIn December, Clover Health elected to exit the Center for Medicaid and Medicaid Services ACO REACH program, which supports care delivery and coordination for people in underserved communities.",
      "# [Quartet Health Launches Innovative Whole Health Program to Improve Outcomes for Patients with Serious Mental Illness on 2024-03-19](https://www.quartethealth.com/perspectives/quartet-health-launches-innovative-whole-health-program-to-improve-outcomes-for-patients-with-serious-mental-illness/)\nPartnership with Clover Health Supports Underserved Patient Population With a New Whole-Person Care Delivery Solution\n\nQuartet Health, a leading value-based behavioral health care enablement and delivery company, today launched their Whole Health program in partnership with Clover Health, a physician enablement company, to better serve patients living with serious mental illnesses (SMI). The first-of-its-kind, whole-person care delivery solution is the only fully integrated physical and behavioral health model that takes accountability for the total cost of care (TCOC) risk on health plans’ most complex members, while also providing wraparound care services for a traditionally underserved patient population. The program was launched first in the New Jersey market.\n\n“Patients with serious mental illness often have worse outcomes and a lower life expectancy, and they experience a fragmented healthcare system that does not adequately address their behavioral, physical, and social needs” said Dr. Michael J. Lipp, Quartet Health’s Chief Medical Officer, and former CMO of the CMS Innovation Center. Clover Health’s members with SMI average at least four different chronic conditions, with more than five different providers prescribing medications. Additionally, one in five members with SMI did not see a primary care physician (PCP) last year, and one in three did not see a behavioral health provider. “Patients often struggle to get access to care, and the care they do receive is often uncoordinated. This program will provide care that is coordinated, comprehensive and convenient, at no additional cost to patients.”\n\nThe partnership with Clover Health gives Quartet Health the opportunity to address the unique needs of this complex patient population with a health equity-based focus, through 24/7 care access, medication support, mental and physical care coordination, as well as local community resource and transportation support. Care teams – both in-market and virtual – will be led by nurse practitioners, trained in both mental health and family medicine, along with care coordinators, social workers, case managers, therapists, peers, and supervising psychiatrists and internal medicine physicians.\n\n“For far too long, behavioral healthcare solutions for individuals living with SMI have not adequately accounted for the interconnectedness of both their physical and mental health needs,” said Christina Mainelli, Quartet Health CEO. “Patients are often forced to navigate an incredibly fragmented healthcare system, a system that fails to meet their needs, contributes to unnecessary hospitalizations and, ultimately, worse outcomes. That’s why it was so critical for us, in developing our Whole Health program, to take an approach that treats the whole person in a way that improves quality and patient outcomes, while also lowering the cost of care.”\n\n“We’re confident that additional behavioral health support for our SMI cohort will increase the quality of life for these members, while continuing to reduce unnecessary spend,” said Brady Priest, CEO of Clover Home Care.",

      "# [A Whole-Person Approach to Mental Health by Christina Mainelli on 2024-04-08](https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/whole-person-approach-to-mental-health)\nQ: What is the scale of the mental health need in the U.S.?\n\nIt’s estimated that more than one in five adults live with a mental illness. And if you add addiction—substance use disorder—that number gets much larger. It’s also pretty alarming that 55% of adults with mental illness go untreated. That’s devastating for those individuals and their families and friends. There are impacts on productivity, employment, even lifespan, and for society there’s lost economic vitality.\n\nFor adults with serious mental illness—think bipolar, schizophrenia, PTSD, major depressive disorder—there are even greater impacts. These individuals often have multiple comorbid conditions and worse health outcomes. Forty to fifty percent of this population also has a substance use disorder.\n\nAdditionally, the impact of mental illness on kids is staggering. Over half of adolescents have had a mental health issue or mental illness. Kids with a mental illness are two times more likely to drop out of school. Suicide is the second leading cause of death for adolescents as a whole and the leading cause of death for 14- and 15-year-olds.\n\nQ: What’s keeping people from getting the care they need?\n\nI think of three major issues that need to be addressed: access, quality, and the fragmentation of the delivery system.\n\nOne way to think of access is simply getting an appointment. You hear about wait times of weeks or months for people struggling with high acuity concerns—meaning their condition may be serious and could benefit from immediate care. The average wait time to see a psychiatrist is 25 days, and it can be up to 90 days. That’s a huge issue. Generally accepted standards include speed to care within 10 days for routine needs, within 48 hours for urgent needs, and within 6 hours for those in non-life-threatening crisis.\n\nFrom a business perspective, access is largely a supply and a matching issue. Almost half of the U.S. population, 164 million people, live in designated mental health professional shortage areas. To bring this to life, in Massachusetts, there’s one behavioral health clinician for every 150 people. In Alabama, there’s one behavioral health clinician for every 920 people. Essentially, in Alabama, there’s simply not enough supply, while in Massachusetts access challenges have more to do with matching the right provider to the patient.\n\nIt’s a very personal experience to obtain mental health care; we want a clinician who understands our circumstances. We may feel more comfortable with someone who “looks like us” in terms of age, race, religion, language, or gender. To fully address access, we need to support patients in getting connected or “matched” to the right behavioral healthcare clinician, and we need clinicians that reflect the complexion of our population as part of addressing health equity issues.\n\nQ: What about quality?\n\nDelivering high quality care that achieves the best outcomes for patients is critical, but significant variation remains in adherence to evidenced based care and in treatment outcomes across care settings, providers, and geographies. There are multiple contributing factors, including training, reimbursement models, and impact of health disparities which need to be addressed both on the healthcare delivery side as well as from a policy perspective.\n\nQ: The third issue you noted was fragmentation.\n\nFragmentation between physical and behavioral healthcare is a huge problem—the more we learn about mental health care, the clearer it is that physical health can be a large determinant of mental health and vice versa.\n\nThere has been progress addressing fragmentation as demonstrated by collaborative care models and related codes, and most recently a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services announcement around Integrated Health Models aimed at advancing holistic care. However, there is still a huge need for a formalized structure that not just enables but also incentivizes primary care doctors to connect with behavioral health specialists.\n\nImagine you’re a primary care physician in a practice seeing patients every 12 to 15 minutes, and someone presents with a mental health issue. It may not be clear how acute the patient is or how serious the issue is. What’s the appropriate treatment pathway? Who should you refer the patient to? It’s not obvious—or efficient to act on—in today’s clinical world.\n\nI often hear that physical health providers are reticent to treat individuals with serious mental illness. Why? Because patients with these conditions often have a complex combination of physical, behavioral, and social health needs.\n\nThere’s a lack of aligned incentives that would enable physical health providers to take on these patients, work with the mental health provider on a treatment plan that addresses all health needs, and engage in an ongoing exchange of information with the patient and the mental health provider about how the patient is progressing.\n\nAll of these things combined contribute to a lack of connectivity between the physical and behavioral health provider. It also creates a confusing and fragmented experience for the patient.\n\nQ: How does Quartet Health work?\n\nQuartet is both a technology platform and a direct provider of patient care. On our digital platform, we are connected to over 10,000 behavioral health providers that service up to 21 million patients. We also have a medical group that directly employs over 250 behavioral health clinicians who see over 500,000 patients a year.\n\nHere’s a real-life example: a 71-year-old female patient in Michigan used her phone to access our digital platform where she answered a few questions and selected what was most important to her in her care. She requested a female provider for virtual and in-person services to help address her anxiety. Within two hours, we reached out to the patient in Michigan and matched her to a provider. The provider contacted her within the hour, and she had her first appointment three days later.\n\nThe patient in Michigan is what we’d consider a good patient experience—within three hours the patient had an appointment set for within three days. This is using technology to help solve the access problem. We triage, match, and then provide care. At every step, we’re measuring outcomes to ensure quality.\n\nWhile this patient used the self-service option, primary care providers on our platform can also make a referral or have someone in the front office go through the initial matching process with a patient. Whether it’s the patient or the provider making the query, it passes right through our algorithms which help match the best behavioral health provider. That’s the connectivity between physical and behavioral health reducing fragmentation.\n\nThe name Quartet refers to what we see as the foundation of the physical health provider, the behavioral health provider, the payer, and the patient all working together.\n\nQ: Why not just operate a digital platform to connect patients to existing providers?\n\nMany behavioral healthcare companies were born out of the pandemic. A lot of them offer point solutions—they’re addressing one specific need. We’re starting to see consolidation in that part of the industry. We’re also seeing some of those companies fail due to lack of a robust business model. The ones that are surviving aren’t just offering point solutions, they’re taking on bigger industry-wide problems.\n\nAt Quartet, we felt that the digital platform alone wasn’t solving a big enough problem, so we made a strategic decision to deliver care ourselves. Quartet Medical Group delivers care in 30+ markets. We practice measurement-based care (MBC) to ensure our clinicians are using evidence-based medicine; we have close to 80% adherence to MBC, which is well above industry best practice. We also offer appointments within 48 hours for high acuity patients, and our outcomes are strong. Our data shows over 40% improvement in total cost of care for patients in our clinic. I don’t know of another company that connects physical health to behavioral health the way we do.\n\nUsing that integrated approach, we’ve just launched a new product. For patients with serious mental illness, we’re building a behavioral health home that delivers whole-person treatment—physical health, behavioral health, and social care, which is reimbursed in a value-based model. I worked closely with two of my classmates from Yale SOM to develop this solution: Tom Dow, who leads our medical economics team, and Michael Lipp, our chief medical officer. Getting to collaborate and innovate with Michael and Tom at Quartet has been one of the greatest gifts from the program.\n\nQ: Why did Quartet choose to focus its new offering on the seriously mentally ill population?\n\nIn the last few years, we’ve seen lots of new entrants in behavioral health—think Talkspace, Headspace, Calm. Most new entrants focus on those with mild mental illness. There are very few programs directed at the moderate to seriously mentally ill.\n\nThis is a patient population that really struggles. Their average lifespan is 15 to 17 years shorter. Often, they do not have access to physical or behavioral healthcare. And from an economic perspective, these are incredibly expensive patients because they require a lot of services and, if they don’t get those services, they end up in situations that require an emergency room or inpatient facility.\n\nI have absolute conviction that we must address the “whole person” in healthcare. I’ve spent over two decades in the field. I’ve worked on the physical health side. I’ve seen the difficulties and complexities of delivering care to patients. I’ve also done work focused on the social determinants of health. That’s why I know Quartet’s approach is an opportunity to improve experience and outcomes for these patients. This is a business opportunity because, in a value-based context, we can deliver higher quality care that lowers overall costs and provides better patient outcomes.\n\nQ: How does the program work?\n\nWe take total cost-of-care accountability. Our primary care and behavioral health clinicians provide care virtually and in person. We meet the patient where they are: in the hospital, in the home, in the community. We provide whatever service the patient needs, whether it’s physical health, behavioral health, or social services. We’re not saying, “Oh, this or that’s not covered.” We’re doing what we think is clinically appropriate for each patient because, at the end of the day, we are rewarded based on our clinical outcomes: Did we reduce cost of care? Did the patient’s health improve?\n\nValue-based care is a very impactful reimbursement model for this population because it aligns incentives. This population has complex needs, with nearly three comorbid conditions on average, and thus requires a payment model that reimburses for not just mental health services but treatment for the whole person. By treating all aspects of health, we can prevent acute events such as hospital admissions by ensuring access, quality, and continuity of care, which in turn lowers overall costs. And we can do this successfully because it’s one care delivery team working together.\n\nThis isn’t a short-term program; we stay with patients for as long as they need us. That could be 12 months or 18 months or it could be three years. We see up to a 30% to 40% total cost-of-care reduction while improving quality and patient experience. It’s early, but we’re seeing very good results to start. For example, we are seeing over 25% patient engagement in a tough to reach population, and over 95% are coming back for follow on appointments and visits. That is an early indicator of success.\n\nQ: How is mental health care usually paid for?\n\nToday, mental health is still primarily a fee-for-service game. If you’re fortunate enough to find a provider that’s in your network, you have a co-pay, but the lion’s share of individuals are using cash pay in order to get access to the mental health provider that they want on the timeline that they want.\n\nA lot of work has been done on mental health parity, which would ensure mental health issues are covered by insurance and that providers are available, but more work needs to be done to fully implement these programs with payers across the country.\n\nI know people who are paying up to $450 an hour to see a therapist in New York City. I don’t think that’s sustainable. It doesn’t solve the core issues at hand with respect to equitable access, quality, or fragmentation. For example, the fee-for-service world does not reimburse for treating the whole person. Services like transportation, wellness visits, or peer support are often not reimbursed, but they are critical to improving health outcomes and lowering overall costs. That’s why we’ve made the choice to work with both commercial and government payers, so the providers we make available to individuals are largely in-network choices, and why we’ve launched our value-based products to provide alternative payment models.\n\nQ: Who is your customer?\n\nWe have a patient-first culture and mentality. We are accountable to our patients, but often we get access to them through a payer, so at the end of the day, our customers are health plans, health systems, community mental health centers, and government payers.\n\nQ: Where do you see the field moving in the next five years?\n\nI think that we are going to see a lot more movement toward value-based care for behavioral health. Traditional fee-for-service does not work for whole-person care or for higher acuity populations—whether its mental health or substance use.\n\nI also absolutely think there’s a place for AI in behavioral healthcare. There’s work being done on patient intake, routine administrative tasks, and transcribing notes from sessions, all of which can help to tackle issues of supply by freeing up staff to focus on patient care.\n\nAI can also analyze vast datasets far more efficiently than humans. This capability can lead to earlier detection of diseases, help develop personalized treatment plans, and lead to better patient outcomes. It’s worth noting that for these efforts to be successful, they rely on high quality data, a multi-disciplinary team to develop and validate recommendations, and the protection of patient data and privacy.\n\nQ: Has your experience at Yale SOM shaped how you approach your work?\n\nI got a tremendous amount out of my Yale SOM experience. Because I chose the healthcare focus, my classmates all worked in healthcare, too, but they had expertise in other disciplines such as law, technology, or medicine. Their different points of view gave me a broader understanding of the many constituents in healthcare and the challenges and opportunities each faces, as well as the importance of the entire healthcare delivery system working together. This broader view and experience have made me a better problem solver, strategist, partner, and leader of people and organizations.",

      "# [Independence Blue Cross expands member options for faster access to behavioral health services, to support their whole health journey by Ajé King on 2024-09-17](https://news.ibx.com/behavioral-health-services/)\nIndependence Blue Cross (IBX) has expanded its covered behavioral health offerings, which include mental health and substance use disorder services and member programs, to better support members’ whole health. The offerings get members the type of care they need faster and give them a wider range of clinicians to choose from.\n\n“As part of our commitment to equitable whole-person health, we have prioritized expanding access to behavioral health care across our community. One of the things we did when looking at our members’ needs was to identify high quality providers, who can get our members quick access to appointments and the services that they need. We have also created mental health value-based programs to recognize our best providers and incentivize continuous improvement in the network,” said Dr. Rodrigo Cerdá, senior vice president of Health Services and chief medical officer at Independence Blue Cross.\n\nEnhancing members’ access to care\n\nMembers have access to a comprehensive and diverse behavioral health network as part of the expanded offerings. It gives members a wider range of services to choose from for a variety of conditions, including:\n\nGeneral mental and behavioral health.\n\nChildren, adolescent, and young adult services.\n\nSpecific conditions, such as eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, substance use disorders, and more.\n\nThe local options include 6,700 behavioral health practitioners in the Philadelphia five-county region who offer in person and virtual care. That is a 47 percent increase from the number of local providers that were in IBX’s network in 2022. More than 500 of the new providers are Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). The top two languages they speak are Spanish and Russian, the two most common languages requested by IBX members. This shows that IBX is working hard to make sure that people have access to health care from providers who are more likely to understand their culture and speak their language.\n\nIBX is also working to improve health equity in behavioral health by encouraging and compensating for depression screenings by all providers, not just those in the behavioral health field which should improve the observed disparity in behavioral health diagnosis and treatment.\n\nAdditionally, IBX offers an expanded set of virtual care options serving both local and out-of-area members, offering convenient access, and innovative care models. Included in these options are “Connect to Care” providers who can help members quickly access appointments with scheduling tools and live intake. These providers have approximately 4,000 appointments available per month and offer appointments in less than seven days. Members can choose from several providers, including but not limited to those focused on:\n\nGeneral mental health care: Grow Therapy, Thriveworks, Headway\n\nChildren, adolescents and young adults: Little Otter, Joon, Handspring Health, Blackbird Health\n\nCare for people with substance use disorders: Pelago, Ria Health, Pursue Care, Forge Health, Crossroads, New Life\n\nOther behavioral health specialty care: Equip Health, NOCD, Quartet Medical Group\n\nNavigating members to the right care when they need it\n\n“Health care is complex and navigating care can be overwhelming. This is especially true for people who are dealing with a mental health or substance use disorder condition,” said Diana Lehman, B.S.N., R.N., vice president of Case and Condition Management at Independence Blue Cross. “That’s why we have Behavioral Health Case Managers, Behavioral Health Customer Care Advocates, and a Clinical Triage Team available to help support members with all aspects of their care.”\n\nIBX Behavioral Health Case Managers are registered nurses, licensed social workers, and professional counselors who proactively identify members who may benefit from behavioral health services. They look at a member’s health history and their care patterns to identify risk levels and offer support. This support involves reaching out to members to help them access care, schedule follow-ups, and stay aligned with their care plans. By identifying unmet needs and supporting quicker access to integrated care, IBX is helping to close care gaps and improve total health. Since making Behavioral Health Case Managers available in 2022, IBX has been able to identify four times more members in need of behavioral health services.\n\nMembers also have access to care navigation services that are provided by specialized IBX Behavioral Health Customer Care Advocates and Licensed Behavioral Health professionals. The team works together to provide risk screening and guide members to the right care options based on their individual needs. High risk members are escalated to the IBX Clinical Triage Team who can identify priority needs, provide in the moment support, directly connect the member to care (via warm transfer or direct scheduling), and follow up to ensure safety and successful linkage. Care navigation services are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to provide members with rapid connection to the right care. Between April 2023 and June 2024, the team has helped more than 20,000 members connect to care. With the support of seamless connection and direct scheduling, members are receiving appointments within five days.\n\nOffering members additional support and tools:\n\nIBX members enrolled in fully insured health plans can get additional support from Quartet Health*, a company that matches them to mental health care that fits their needs, preferences, and is covered by their health insurance. In addition to its regular platform, Quartet Health has a Virtual Clinic that it launched in 2022 with IBX. The clinic, which focuses on treating the needs of patients with serious mental illness, has a patient appointment availability guarantee within 48 hours. IBX, as part of its strategic partnership with and investment in Quartet, offers these navigational services free to eligible members.\n\nThe company also gives members access to the Shatterproof* Treatment Atlas® tool. The tool helps people search and compare addiction treatment facilities to find high-quality care for themselves or their loved ones. Members also have coverage for mental health coaching by Teladoc Health*, a digital resource that offers personalized, evidence-based programs and dedicated support for a wide range of topics, including stress, depression, chronic pain, work-life balance, substance use, and anxiety. The Mental Health Coaching is available 24/7 from a computer or the Teladoc mobile app.\n\nVisit www.ibx.com for more information on IBX’s expanded offerings for behavioral health and to see how they are helping to give members quicker and expanded access to care, enhancing care coordination, closing care gaps, ensuring appropriate use of services, and supporting innovative products and programs.\n\n*Independent companies",

Our latest study has demonstrated the remarkable capability of our MFVB platform to accurately discern individuals' mental health symptoms based on short recordings of their voice.\n\nLeading enterprise vocal biomarker company Sonde Health has partnered with Together, an AI-based health assistant, to provide enhanced mental health detection and monitoring through its new Mental Vitals feature. This collaboration integrates Sonde’s pioneering technology into the Together app, allowing users to access advanced voice analysis for early detection of symptoms related to depression and anxiety. Launched only a month ago, more than 20% of Together’s daily users are already using Sonde-powered Mental Vitals.\n\nHidden away in our voices are signals that may hold clues to how we’re doing, what we’re feeling and even what’s going on with our physical health. Now, AI systems tasked with analyzing these signals are moving into healthcare.\n\nSonde Health, a health technology company committed to bringing accessible health monitoring to everyone, in conjunction with the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Frontotemporal Disorders (FTD) Unit, has been selected by the Massachusetts Artificial Intelligence and Technology Center for Connected Care in Aging & Alzheimer’s Disease (MassAITC) to lead a pilot study focused on leveraging vocal biomarkers for remote detection and monitoring of mild cognitive impairment in the home environment.\n\nBy David Liu, CEO Sonde Health December 8th, 2022\n\nI am beyond excited to share the latest major milestone in Sonde’s journey to making preventive care possible through voice-powered health monitoring.\n\nWe have raised $19.25 million in Series B funding, led by Partners Investment, with NEOM Company and KT Corporation participating. Our existing investors, co-founder PureTech Health, M Ventures, MP Healthcare Venture Management, Neoteny and Evidity Health Capital all came back and invested in this round.\n\nBOSTON – Dec. 8, 2022 – Sonde Health, a health technology company committed to bringing accessible health monitoring to everyone, has raised a $19.25 million Series B investment round led by Partners Investment, with participation from NEOM Company, KT Corporation, and existing investors, including co-founder PureTech Health and M Ventures. The company has raised $35.25 million in total and will use the funding to drive its global commercial growth, deepen its respiratory and mental health monitoring technologies, and build capabilities for additional health conditions.\n\nBy Elizabeth Svoboda Updated December 8, 2022, 3:00 a.m.\n\nNew apps promise to detect when you’re feeling blue and o!er some\n\nassistance. But they still have to prove that the benefits of sharing\n\nsensitive data outweigh any drawbacks.\n\nSEOUL -- South Korea's top telecom company KT will enhance the competitiveness of the artificial intelligence-based health diagnosis business through a strategic investment in Sonde Health, a United States-based digital medicine company specializing in the detection of various diseases such as mental health and respiratory disorders through the analysis of voices.\n\nSoftware that analyzes snippets of your speech to identify mental health problems is rapidly making its way into call centers, medical clinics and telehealth platforms. The idea is to detect illnesses that might otherwise go untreated. Why it matters: Proponents of \"voice biomarker\" technology say the underlying artificial intelligence is good enough to recognize depression, anxiety and a host of other maladies.\n\nDavid Liu is CEO of Sonde Health, a company using vocal biomarkers to assess patient health, wellness, and fitness. The company is white labeling its solution for app developers with initial products for respiratory and mental health problems.\n\nIn the interview, Liu discusses the product, technology, and key markets serving as the first adopters. These include healthcare providers and payers along with one industry I wasn’t expecting.\n\nLiu has been CEO of Sonde Health since 2019. He previously was the chief operating officer at Quartet Health and education technology company Knewton and was a senior vice president at AOL. He earned an engineering degree from Purdue and an MBA from Columbia.\n\nSonde’s vocal biomarker technology to analyze ongoing mental and physical health challenges of people across four African countries during the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nSonde Health, in collaboration with Michigan State University, University of Botswana, University of Ghana, University of Dar es Salaam, and University of Nigeria, Nsukka, has launched a new study that uses vocal biomarkers to identify and understand the relationship among physical activity, mental health, and respiratory health of individuals living in Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sonde Health and the Cognitive Behavior Institute (CBI) have teamed up to study the effectiveness of Sonde’s Mental Fitness app as an engagement and monitoring tool for patients with depression and anxiety to help health systems and wellness service providers enhance patient care.\n\nThe study will use Sonde Mental Fitness, a voice-enabled mental health detection and monitoring technology that analyzes the sound of patients’ voices to evaluate aspects of mental well-being. By combining voice recordings, patient symptoms, and medical data, this research will enable Sonde to continue to improve its vocal biomarker models for depression and mental health monitoring.\n\nA leader from the health tech company explains how voice-based technologies could transform monitoring of patients with dementia, Alzheimer's, and other conditions.\n\nVocal biomarkers can be highly useful, telling caregivers and researchers things that other vital signs are not able to fully show. Outsourcing-Pharma recently spoke with David Liu, CEO of health technology company Sonde Health, about the potential of vocal biomarkers in research and care, and how the company's voice-enabled symptom detection and monitoring platform can be useful in watching chronic and mental health conditions\n\nImagine a test as quick and easy as having your temperature taken or your blood pressure measured that could reliably identify an anxiety disorder or predict an impending depressive relapse.\n\nHealth care providers have many tools to gauge a patient’s physical condition, yet no reliable biomarkers — objective indicators of medical states observed from outside the patient — for assessing mental health.\n\nBut some artificial intelligence researchers now believe that the sound of your voice might be the key to understanding your mental state — and A.I. is perfectly suited to detect such changes, which are difficult, if not impossible, to perceive otherwise. The result is a set of apps and online tools designed to track your mental status, as well as programs that deliver real-time mental health assessments to telehealth and call-center providers.",
      "# [VMFH Delivers on Its Mission to Expand Access](https://www.vmfh.org/about-vmfh/news-media/news-releases/vmfh-delivers-on-its-mission-to-expand-access)\nToday, Virginia Mason Franciscan Health (VMFH) announced key milestones in its ongoing efforts to improve access and reduce cost of care for residents across the Puget Sound, especially those on the Kitsap Peninsula. Kitsap County’s population growth is outpacing Washington state averages, while there remains a shortage of primary care and specialty care providers in the area, presenting both a unique challenge and opportunity to better serve the community.\n\nTo help address some of the community's most pressing needs, VMFH plans to open a hybrid Emergency Department (ED)/Urgent Care clinic in Port Orchard. This will be its second hybrid ED/urgent care clinic developed in partnership with Intuitive Health, with the first location currently under construction and set to open in Bremerton in early 2025. Combined, the two locations will drastically improve emergency/urgent care access from Gig Harbor to Silverdale and beyond.\n\n“This is a significant step in our ongoing efforts to improve access to needed care across Kitsap County and beyond to better serve our communities,” noted Ketul J. Patel, Chief Executive Officer of Virginia Mason Franciscan Health and President of CommonSpirit Health’s Northwest Region. “The hybrid ED/urgent care model is one great example of how we can improve our patient experience, getting patients to the right level of care while also reducing costs, and alleviating some strain on our hospitals.\"\n\nWhen a patient comes to the hybrid ED/urgent care clinic, they will be examined and triaged to the appropriate level of care, removing the burden for patients who may not know where to go. The facility will be staffed with emergency-trained physicians and nurses and fully equipped like a traditional hospital emergency department. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) can bring patients directly to the hybrid ED/urgent care facility, which will accommodate ambulances onsite.\n\n“By collaborating on innovative, community-based solutions, like the Port Orchard hybrid ED/urgent care clinic, we are able to expand access to care that best fits patient needs, while preserving hospital emergency department capacity for the most serious conditions and injuries,” noted Chad Melton, President at St. Michael Medical Center.\n\nEmergency Departments across the country continue to be over utilized. This impacts access to care for those who need emergency medicine services and increases costs for patients. St. Michael Medical Center, located in Silverdale and serving the Port Orchard community, is home to one of the busiest EDs in the state of Washington with more than 80,000 visits each year.\n\nConstruction for the Port Orchard ED/urgent care (located at 450 S Kitsap Blvd, Port Orchard, WA 98366) is anticipated to begin this summer with completion in 2025. It will be open 24/7, equipped with onsite lab equipment and a radiology suite with X-ray and multi-slice CT scanners. Patients can also expect walk-in convenience and shorter wait times compared to a traditional emergency room visit.\n\nThe Port Orchard hybrid ED/urgent care clinic is just one example of many investments by VMFH to better serve Kitsap County residents. Other examples of initiatives in progress to expand access to care include:\n\nCARES (Community Assistance, Referral, and Education Service) Mobile Health Taskforce: St. Michael Medical Center is partnering with the Central Kitsap Fire & Rescue CARES programs by employing a mobile provider team to treat patients in the field, with the goal of reducing the need for non-emergency 911 calls, ED visits and hospital readmissions.\n\nBehavioral Health Support: VMFH continues to collaborate with Kitsap Mental Health Services and has expanded options for virtual behavioral health services through Concert and Quartet Health.\n\nFuture Workforce Growth: Through an expanded partnership with Olympic College, VMFH is supporting workforce development programs to build a future diverse pipeline of students interested in a health care career.\n\nPrimary Care Development: The VMFH Family Medicine Clinic in Bremerton has expanded access to primary care, and its Family Medicine Residency Program trains 24 family medicine residents, with eight graduates, per year.\n\nHospital Capacity: St. Michael Medical Center is currently building a new patient tower that will house 74 additional acute care beds to be completed in fall 2025.\n\nWhile there remains much work to be done, VMFH is proud to continue addressing the unique needs of each community it serves. More information on efforts specific to Kitsap County can be found in the St. Michael Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment.\n\n“We have proudly served this community for more than 105 years,” noted Chad Melton, St. Michael Medical Center President. “We don’t just work here, most of us also live here and know firsthand how unique our history is and how much has changed over the last several years. We’re excited to be an integral part of shaping the future of Kitsap and beyond.”\n\nAbout Virginia Mason Franciscan Health"
