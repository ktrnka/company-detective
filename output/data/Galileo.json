      "# [The Generative AI Evaluation Company](https://www.galileo.ai/)\nThere is a strong need for an evaluation toolchain across prompting, fine-tuning and production monitoring to proactively mitigate hallucinations. Galileo offers exactly that toolchain. Highly recommend it to all GenAI builders!\n\nWaseem Alshikh\n\nCo-founder and CTO\n\n\"Before Galileo, we could go three days before knowing if something bad is happening. With Galileo, we can know within minutes. Galileo fills in the gap we had in instrumentation and observability.\"\n\nDarrel Cherry\n\nDistinguished Engineer\n\n\"Before Galileo, getting from 70% to 100% accuracy was a significant challenge. With Galileo, we've not only improved our responses but also scaled our services efficiently. Galileo has truly filled the gap for us.\"\n\nRandall Newman\n\nCo-founder & CPO",
      "# [Galileo Research](https://www.galileo.ai/research)\nPrivate\n\nA major bottleneck to evaluations is the need for a test set. Creating a high-quality test set is often labor-intensive and expensive, typically requiring the involvement of human experts or GPT models.\n\nWith Galileo Luna, you do not need for ground truth test sets. To do this, we pre-trained EFMs on evaluation-specific datasets across a variety of domains. This innovation not only saves teams considerable time and resources, but also reduces cost significantly. The Luna EFMs power a host of evaluation tasks. Visit our docs to read more about each of these evaluation tasks.\n\nCustomizable\n\nEven with 75%+ (industry-leading) accuracy rates, some use cases need much higher precision auto evaluation. For instance, when working with an AI team at a large pharma organization working on new drug discovery, it was clear that the cost of potential hallucinations would be catastrophic to their chances for the drug passing the next phase of clinical trials. Moreover, it was extremely hard to get expert humans to evaluate the model response. Therefore, Galileo’s Luna EFM needed to provide 95%+ accuracy.\n\nTo accomplish this, we fine-tuned the client’s EFMs to their specific needs. Every Luna model can be quickly fine-tuned with customers’ data in their cloud using Galileo’s Fine Tune product to provide an ultra-high accuracy custom evaluation model within minutes!\n\n-ChainPoll: a novel approach to hallucination detection that is substantially more accurate than any metric we’ve encountered in the academic literature. Across a diverse range of benchmark tasks, the ChainPoll outperforms all other methods – in most cases, by a huge margin.\n\n- ChainPoll dramatically out-performs a range of published alternatives – including SelfCheckGPT, GPTScore, G-Eval, and TRUE – in a head-to-head comparison on RealHall.\n\n- ChainPoll is also faster and more cost-effective than most of the metrics listed above.\n\n- Unlike all other methods considered here, ChainPoll also provides human-readable verbal justifications for the judgments\n\n- it makes, via the chain-of-thought text produced during inference.\n\n- Though much of the research literature concentrates on the the easier case of closed-domain hallucination detection, we show that ChainPoll is equally strong when detecting either open-domain or closed domain hallucinations. We develop versions of ChainPoll specialized to each of these cases: ChainPoll-Correctness for open-domain and ChainPoll-Adherence for closed-domain.",

It is hot shit. Will out put a few decent designs then I am sure they pass off allocation of resources once you sign up and pay. Very quickly you will see the designs deteriorate and the AI will just stop taking input commands and generate designs (wasting credits) without making changes. I use Ai on the regular and know how to manage prompts. It seems intentional honestly. Don't waste your money till they fix this or learn how to allocate resources and keep up quality. \n\nAlso, the AI can only generate components to a certain degree of complexity. It seems like it has access to static components it can slightly change inputs to render outputs, but beyond that it can't. For instance if you need a graph or chart with customization, it can't make it beyond the standard graph.. because it can't fully generate a component from scratch. It can only pull from what seems a preset amount of components. \n\nNot worth the money.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Comment ID j7z6rqq with +1 score by [(thicckar, Reddit, 2023-02-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/10y2un4/new_ai_tool_called_galileo_that_will_deliver/j7z6rqq/) (in reply to ID 10y2un4):\nGod damn\n\n## Comment ID j7zkho6 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-02-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/10y2un4/new_ai_tool_called_galileo_that_will_deliver/j7zkho6/) (in reply to ID 10y2un4):\nBro stfu...

Therefore, we focused on training specialized models on tasks aligned with UI design standards. Helen's deep knowledge in design was able to drive significant improvements by training the AI on the concepts of components, colors, styles, and other design principles. Likewise, Arnaud leveraged his experience at Google where he learned to train state-of-the-art language models by creating custom datasets. This enabled the team to build a unique UI design dataset, which is key to the superior quality of UI generation.\"\n\nLooks like they have one model focused on extracting the right design colours, theming, type of components from the prompt. and another LLM trained on custom datasets (probably react components/templates) which composes all the elements together.\n\n## Comment ID kqmu0zo with +6 score by [(Similar-Feature-140, Reddit, 2024-02-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1arxxxg/d_how_do_you_train_generative_ai_for_ui_design/kqmu0zo/) (in reply to ID 1arxxxg):\nmaybe they fine tune LLM? like llamma or chatgpt to generate html w styling?\n\n## Comment ID kxzoijw with +1 score by [(Ok_Ice5420, Reddit, 2024-04-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1arxxxg/d_how_do_you_train_generative_ai_for_ui_design/kxzoijw/) (in reply to ID 1arxxxg):\nim trying to figure that too , did you find an answer?\n\n## Comment ID kqmsrcu with +1 score by [(WiseFriendship3426, Reddit, 2024-02-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1arxxxg/d_how_do_you_train_generative_ai_for_ui_design/kqmsrcu/) (in reply to ID 1arxxxg):\nInteresting post\n\n## Comment ID kqn80u6 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-02-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1arxxxg/d_how_do_you_train_generative_ai_for_ui_design/kqn80u6/) (in reply to ID 1arxxxg):\n[removed]\n\n## Comment ID kqoqa0x with +1 score by [(vatsadev, Reddit, 2024-02-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1arxxxg/d_how_do_you_train_generative_ai_for_ui_design/kqoqa0x/) (in reply to ID 1arxxxg):\nProbably a VLM designing this?

This still scares me a bit, heres why.\n\nIndeed, this is absolutely not viable currently and can’t do much more than produce dribbble type designs with very limited value.\n\nWhat happens though, when someone plugs in something like Hotjar data and starts teaching these things how to improve in real time based on real client signals? Combine that with good prompting and enough time for it to iterate on this current version and we can start to imagine nightmare scenarios.\n\nCompanies could potentially buy a product that plugs into their existing site, learns the current design system and tracks user signals to then make real time updates based on that data. It could even AB test different solutions and apply all sorts of the well known UX methodologies to decide on its own roadmap. Configuration/ good prompting could take this even further of course.\n\nThe only missing piece here (unless something exists that I don’t know about) is a way to automate the interpretation of user feedback and signals into actionable tasks.\n\nThat can’t be hard, stupid example:\n\n- 10 users emailed us about our shopping cart being annoying to use\n- 100 users took 1 minute or more to find the buy now button\n- Look at existing flow and the specific data of all these users\n- Find they are all using tiny iPhone SEs\n- Test flow on iPhone SE \n- See that the buy button is below the fold now due to small device height\n- Generate potential solutions\n- AB test them with users in real time \n- Repeat the last two steps\n- Fire your design team\n\nOk it’s not that simple, but you get my point. Things can evolve.\n\nFrom a branding standpoint it’s not impossible either. You can improve any system if you can collect, understand and apply user feedback (direct or indirect).\n\nGoogleAds just fired hundreds of sales people while at the same time announcing automation tools like Performance Max… make of that what you wish but I personally don’t like the looks of it.\n\nMy point is things are evolving really fast and looking at something like this and saying “it will never” is probably an overstatement. \n\nI look at this and think more like “it can’t yet”\n\nJust my 2c. Happy designing everybody. :)\n\n### Comment ID kppk86g with +6 score by [(BobTehCat, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1amolz4/example_of_an_ai_tool_that_can_take_away_1000s_of/kppk86g/) (in reply to ID kpo24sz):\nIt’s starting to looking like the only way to be unaffected by AI js to become a jazz musician.\n\n### Comment ID kr68261 with +1 score by [(maowai, Reddit, 2024-02-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1amolz4/example_of_an_ai_tool_that_can_take_away_1000s_of/kr68261/) (in reply to ID kpo24sz):\nI think what you’re describing is the long-term evolution of UX design: not the goal of creating mocked-up UIs, but the orchestration of persona-level or individual user-level experience generation and optimization. I think it’s difficult to imagine what exactly that looks like in terms of a UX Designers day-to-day activities, but we must acknowledge that our skills and knowledge are still applicable even if we’re not down at the level of individual layouts, buttons and checkboxes.\n\nOf course, there’s the notion that “a designer isn’t needed because the AI will just make everything perfect itself,” but I think that, at least for the foreseeable future, such a system will need to be set up, monitored and configured to keep its boundaries and decision making processes in check.\n\nI’m perfectly willing to admit and accept that part of my job will not always be creating UI mockups, and the experiences that I help create will be much more fluid and personalized. But I still think that there’s a big need in all of that for people who decide and configure how all of that works, specifically.\n\n## Comment ID kpnmwr3 with +9 score by [(morphcore, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1amolz4/example_of_an_ai_tool_that_can_take_away_1000s_of/kpnmwr3/) (in reply to ID 1amolz4):\nJobs that can be taken away by this tool, were already irrelevant before it existed.\n\n### Comment ID kprjhmb with +1 score by [(Successful-Leek-1900, Reddit, 2024-02-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1amolz4/example_of_an_ai_tool_that_can_take_away_1000s_of/kprjhmb/) (in reply to ID kpnmwr3):\nIt did even before AI came to the picture.\n\n## Comment ID kpn0vil with +7 score by [(newtownkid, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1amolz4/example_of_an_ai_tool_that_can_take_away_1000s_of/kpn0vil/) (in reply to ID 1amolz4):\nLol have you tried generating a website with it?

For those who think that the boss can now have his secretary come up with the UI and somehow have it made, the boss can never give clear direction, so I don't believe an AI is going to be able to figure that out. \n\nNow the boss could hire a designer, some mediocre graphic designer and they can use this AI to make the website interface. Just from what I'm seeing on that side, everything still looks very turnkey and cookie cutter. Maybe if it's pushed it'll come up with something more unique, but I still feel like eventually we're going to see someone tell the designer they want the site to look different from everything else out there. \n\nLastly, the one big thing I always push out there is that if a business that relies on its website or app for its revenue generation believes that it doesn't need anybody thinking about UX, even if they can have these beautiful layouts created, then it's only a matter of time before they hit a problem and don't know how to fix it. \n\nI keep thinking about the example in that book I read *Escaping the Build Trap*, where a company that does these meal kits couldn't figure out why they weren't getting subscriptions, and they were ready to spruce up the design or offer free gifts, basically throwing things out there without any actual research or thought put into it. The author did the research and figured out that most people were not signing up because they couldn't easily see the menu of the meal kits on the website. It was too buried. \n\nThis is what I'm getting at. AI could probably speed up the work, and maybe possibly a company that has overwhelmed. UX designers can now have more balanced UX designers, but it's not going to completely replace things because the UX team are the people that dig into the human behavior that goes into their websites and apps to figure out why something isn't playing right with the customer. \n\nEven without all that, I've seen too many occurrences of people that proclaim they want the website or the app to look different from everyone else, and unless the systems can pull that off, it usually ends up requiring a real designer to think outside of the box. Let's think about that when everybody was using bootstrap and WordPress to make quick sites and others thought that their line of work was dead.\n\n## Comment ID kpnbygh with +3 score by [(42kyokai, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1amolz4/example_of_an_ai_tool_that_can_take_away_1000s_of/kpnbygh/) (in reply to ID 1amolz4):\nThese are pretty trash.\n\n## Comment ID kpnc5ee with +3 score by [(highway84revisited, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1amolz4/example_of_an_ai_tool_that_can_take_away_1000s_of/kpnc5ee/) (in reply to ID 1amolz4):\nSo another one that believes that a lawyer is simply gonna open an account with an ai website builder to create his own website. yeah sure…\n\n## Comment ID kpnd0jo with +3 score by [(cabbage-soup, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1amolz4/example_of_an_ai_tool_that_can_take_away_1000s_of/kpnd0jo/) (in reply to ID 1amolz4):\nI did an experiment with Framer AI to see the worst website it could produce.

It was extremely difficult to get unique fonts and custom color palettes. It just recycles the same average looking designs. \n\nIt’s obvious who’s using these tools and the people who do will not have products that stand out.

Rather than starting from nothing, I now articulate my goals, and let AI handle the first exploration. I've been playing around with a bunch of them lately and thought it might help others.\n\n* [V0](http://v0.dev/) by Vercel is pretty good for getting designs done quickly. Picking components is really straightforward, also they were rolled out Figma integration last week, so its possible to get design from Figma. But this is more engineering-targeted tool like Bolt.\n* [Bolt](http://bolt.new/) by Stackblitz is cool and exactly same with v0 about its capabilities. They've got Figma integration too and deployment options, which makes life easier for developers who want to turn designs into working code fast. I like how you can edit designs through chat - it's different but works well. Perfect for solo projects when you need to move quickly.\n* [Polymet](http://polymet.ai/) is doing some interesting stuff. Their focus is only product design, and get this - you can turn images and sketches straight into UI. Making prototypes is quick, the editing feels natural - kind of like Framer. What really makes it stand out though is how well it handles team collaboration, as if you are working with your teammates, there should be a collaboration place.\n* [Galileo AI](https://www.usegalileo.ai/explore) is pretty versatile - handles both mobile and web designs. Works well with Figma and gives you code you can actually use. Even if you're not a designer, you can edit stuff through chat, though you need to be pretty clear about what you want to change. Great option if you're working on different platforms.\n* [Uizard](http://uizard.ai/) comes with lots of design guides and templates, which is handy. You can make prototypes and it gives you React code too. The Figma plugin works well, and anyone can use it thanks to the drag-and-drop setup. They've got team features too, which is great for group work.\n\nIf you've an extraordinary tool, please drop your suggestions to me and others. Its not so hard to pick one, all of them have freemium package, try and choose.\n\nDrop me a message if you want to know more about any of these - happy to share more details about my experience with them!\n\n## Comment ID mg4cnzc with +2 score by [(arpitashinde, Reddit, 2025-03-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/product_design/comments/1hcj56d/ai_product_design_tools_comparisons_v0_bolt/mg4cnzc/) (in reply to ID 1hcj56d):\nWhat my team has been doing is use GPT O1/O3 or Claude sonnet for brainstorming on the problem statement. It gives great ideas as it has knowledge about many things, it is not biased, you can add your product context in the project files and give context which helps the model give solutions that fit better for your unique product, rather than generic shit. User flows, user personas, and ideation have been great with these tools. When it comes to UI, we have tried tools like Lovable, V0, Bolt, Claude artifact and although there is scope for improvement - it has significantly reduced the execution time. We generate prompts from Claude or GPT as they have full context after brainstorming and then, feed that prompt to UI tools and keep iterating if required. Galileo and UIzard have not been helpful to me as they don't follow the prompt properly compared to the above tools.  \nLet me know if this helps!\n\n## Comment ID m1oibep with +1 score by [(OkSuggestion626, Reddit, 2024-12-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/product_design/comments/1hcj56d/ai_product_design_tools_comparisons_v0_bolt/m1oibep/) (in reply to ID 1hcj56d):\nThank you for sharing all the Al and Design tools, Polymet looks interesting - I had seen before that they were in YC-S24. They've made quite a bit of progress so far and are focused on developing their products quickly. I'm actively trying to use it and they're doing a nice job of rapidly updating the product. Compared to their competitors, as you mentioned, making revisions and edits to the product feels really natural.\n\n## Comment ID m30kfs1 with +1 score by [(CreativeIdols, Reddit, 2024-12-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/product_design/comments/1hcj56d/ai_product_design_tools_comparisons_v0_bolt/m30kfs1/) (in reply to ID 1hcj56d):\nIf I already prototyped in Figma but I'm not happy with the UX/UI, which one of these tools would you recommend to push my app to the next level?",

I won't lie to you, the bot isn't a magic money-making machine. It has\r\nits own limitations and, yeah, you need to watch your trades carefully.\r\nRegarding the accuracy rate, I've noticed that they calculate the winning rate based on closed\r\ntrades. Like any other bot, Galileo FX sometimes waits out the market if the trade isn't going as\r\nplanned, hence some trades might be open for a long time. It's not necessarily a bad thing, just\r\na strategy – some trades simply take longer to hit the take profit.\r\nAs for the issue of threatening legal action, I think they're mainly trying to protect their\r\nreputation. It's hard for businesses these days with so many trolls and bad-faith reviews out\r\nthere. Just keep in mind, there are two sides to every story.\r\nI can only speak from my experience – and for me, Galileo FX has been pretty solid. I've made\r\ngood money with it, albeit with some initial losses. It's definitely not a 'get rich quick' scheme but\r\nwith patience, you can yield decent profits.\r\nAlways remember to invest what you're willing to lose, and don't put all your eggs in one basket.\r\nAs the old saying goes, \"Hope for the best, prepare for the worst\".

I'm an American guy, married and around your age. I can definitely share my\r\nexperience with Galileo FX EA. Just remember I'm not a pro trader, alright? My day job is as a\r\nmarketing manager, not a finance whiz.\r\nI jumped into trading with Galileo back in 2022 and carried on through 2023. I won't sugarcoat it, at\r\nthe beginning, it was a bit rocky – I lost about $2,000. But you know what they say, no risk, no reward,\r\nright? Eventually, I started getting the hang of it, tweaked some settings, and so far, I've made around\r\n$25,837. Pretty neat, huh?\r\nI've been using the slow settings on Galileo FX. Tried it with all forex pairs, even played around with\r\nsome indexes and crypto. I've been using it on MetaTrader 4 with Oanda as my broker.\r\nListen, I get it. It's tempting to believe in those crazy bots claiming sky-high profits, but remember,\r\nRome wasn't built in a day. Just like anything else, you've got to give it time and be patient. It's\r\nimportant not to gamble away more than you're willing to lose.\r\nSo, my two cents? If you're willing to put in the effort and play it smart, go for it. Hope this helps!

I've had a good run with Galileo FX, but it's important to remember that past performance doesn't necessarily predict future results.

Either web or mobile app.\nIdeally by describing features that should be present on a screen, giving some hints for inspiration of the design of other apps.\n\n\nI have tried using Midjourney without getting any usable results so far… so before going down a prompt engineering rabbit hole, I’ve figured will ask community if something I am looking for already exist.\n\n\nTo give more background, generated design would be used to build an web app so if step of coming up with an image of the design that will be sliced into HTML/CSS is an overkill, if there is a tool that will be building the website using chat based prompts as an input that may be another path to achieve same end goal.\n\n\nThank you for your help.\n\n## Comment ID ji4y7cf with +5 score by [(That_Panda_8819, Reddit, 2023-04-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AIAssisted/comments/132gj8l/best_ai_tool_for_appuiux_design/ji4y7cf/) (in reply to ID 132gj8l):\nI hope someone has a good answer, the best I can offer is that sometimes I ask chatgpt to wireframe in ASCII.

      "# [How AI Can Radically Interconnect A Business… And Also HR by joshbersin on 2024-12-11](https://joshbersin.com/2024/12/the-most-powerful-feature-of-ai-in-business-interconnectedness/)\nAI is turning out to be pretty spectacular. Starting with ChatGPT and now moving to agents, reasoning, voice, image and video creation, the technology seems boundless. And now that Elon Musk has figured out how to connect 100,000 Nvidia chips in a high speed network, the opportunity just gets bigger.\n\nAmong all the things we’ll do with AI (art, music, warfare, medicine, science, learning), there is one feature that excites me the most. And as a business person first, analyst second, I think it has the most potential.\n\nThat feature is “interconnectedness.”\n\nFor the first time in my adult life, we have a technology that can understand the interconnectedness of information.\n\nI have always been a systems thinker. Perhaps from my background in science, I’ve always felt that any given problem or issue could be best understood if we knew all the related factors. I’ve been reading a magnificent book “The Song of the Cell,” by Siddhartha Mukherjee, and the interconnectedness of the human body is magical. Each one of our cells, in its own complex way, works with its peers to create the magic of life.\n\nCompanies are the same. In fact as I read the book I realized that our companies are not unlike the human bodies: individual teams (cells) do things together and later have to interconnect, share, and coexist with the whole. This systemic idea (the core of Systemic HR) is what differentiates high performing companies from their peers.\n\nI want my HR friends to think about this. Not only is every financial and business process connected (that supplier that raised his price just upset your profit on a product, forcing your sales people to discount, impacting your customer brand, for example), but HR people essentially operate in this “soup of data” every day.\n\nA single decision like “who to hire” has enormous systemic effects throughout your organization. And if we want to make these individual “cellular” decisions well, we have to see how they interconnect with the rest of the system.\n\nListen To This Podcast\n\nIf this seems too abstract to you, please listen to the following podcast.\n\nAfter months of work with Galileo™ (which interconnects HR practices amazingly well) and many vendor discussions, I developed a pragmatic vision to explain how AI could change the entire process of talent management. It explains how an AI Agent could interconnect all our talent processes in a highly systemic way.\n\nCan we trust it? As the financial community has discovered (read this piece on Black Box vs White Box models), the answer is yes. AI systems, as unexplainable as they may be, outperform our own simple models. (Human cells behave astoundingly well even though we don’t fully understand them.)\n\nOver time I think we’ll do away with “recruiting” and “performance management” and “career management” and end up with Systemic Talent Management. The same will happen to rewards (we call it Systemic Rewards), learning (Systemic L&D), employee engagement, and more.\n\nAll these things are interconnected and we always knew this.

      "# [\"A Bloomberg terminal for HR people\" - Josh Bersin's Galileo AI assistant is unleashed by Sarah  Aryanpur on 2024-05-20](https://diginomica.com/bloomberg-terminal-hr-people-josh-bersins-galileo-ai-assistant-unleashed)\nAs the Josh Bersin Company kicks off its annual Irresistible conference in LA today, the firm’s Galileo AI assistant has gone into general availability mode. To date, around a hundred customers have been using the tech in beta mode. So, what’s the skinny? According to Josh Bersin himself:\n\nIt is a deeply-trained AI assistant, primarily targeted towards HR professionals, and uses 25 years of research, case studies and vendors and benchmarks and just amazing amounts of information. It has been trained using our extensive HR resources, and is not scraping its data from the Internet. I like to think of it a like a Bloomberg terminal for HR people.\n\nBuilt on Sana AI, Galileo has a workgroup version for small teams of two or three people, up to an enterprise version. The enterprise version also has the option to create a protected environment for the organization. It will allow users to talk to other AI tools and access Galileo from other available systems. Bersin says:\n\nA lot of companies want to put their own content into Galileo, their own hiring practices, their own pay models, and then turn it over to their employees and let their employees ask questions. So it's actually not just our content, we expect it to be client content too.\n\nGalileo also shows sources of information, allowing users to read a research report, listen to an audio or a video of the original interview that provided the information.\n\nPartnering\n\nThe Josh Bersin Company is also lifting the lid on its Trusted Partner Program at this week’s conference, with four partners providing additional data for Galileo, Lightcast, Visier, Oyster, and Heidrick and Struggles. Each brings particular skills to the mix.\n\nLightcast assesses and collects skills and job related data from the labor market. Bersin explains:\n\nIt scrapes job postings from around the world, getting data from economic departments and state agencies and they have this massive database of job titles, job descriptions and skills, and they classify skills as essential skills and differentiating skills. So we've collected all that skills data for Galileo. So you can start asking Galileo questions about ‘How do I hire people with this job title? What are the other job titles or roles that I might be considering?’. It uses that skills data to create interview questions. Most companies are currently trying to figure out how to build a skills model on their own. So this is a huge way to get started.\n\nThe second partner is Visier, which has 1000s of companies that are using Visier to run reports on retention rate, or time to hire, or cause to hire or whatever, and has produced a benchmark database based on all this real world data. Bersin comments:\n\nWe have extracted two particular benchmarks. One is voluntary turnover, which is the percentage of people that are quitting in a given year. The second is span of control, and we're getting that data by industry, by job tenure, how many years you've been with the company, by gender, by managerial level. So you could go by job role, and say ‘I'm the head of sales, and 30% of my people just quit. What should I do?’ And Galileo would say, ‘Well, based on benchmarks, you're 22% Above Average, for your industry, so you certainly have a problem’. Or it might say, ‘You're doing great because the average is actually 45%’.\n\nThe third partner, Oyster, deals with global employment practices:\n\nOyster enables users to ask questions like ‘I need to hire a software engineer in New Zealand. What should be the vacation policy? I want a diversity of job candidates in Australia. What are the diversity practices in Australia versus the United States?’.\n\nOyster is a global payroll provider that has collected all this data, and is licensing all of its global employment practices to Galileo. So you can ask Galileo virtually any hiring or staffing or managerial question about a particular jurisdiction.\n\nFinally, Heidrick and Struggles, an executive search company, handles about 2000 Senior Executive searches every year. It has built a leadership model that helps it assess who's going to be a good leader in an executive search, and it has shared the documentation in that model with Galileo. Bersin says:\n\nIt will let HR people ask questions like, ‘Who would be good? How would I find a good leader for this project? How do I assess leaders in this part of the organization? What are the characteristics of this group that might help me improve the leadership capabilities of their team?’. It starts writing all sorts of answers about leadership, and it then gives you examples. So if the Board has said it needs to build a better leadership program, it will actually walk through and you can ask good questions like, ‘ We're in this industry, and we're growing at this rate and so forth’, and it will say, ‘Well, here's the characteristics of leaders you should look for. Here's the way you assess them. And here's some examples of other companies doing it’.\n\nBersin believes there is a big existential change going on in HR, where people with highly skilled professional jobs are moving between industries and taking their skills with them. In the US, 40% of workers change jobs every year, and half of them are changing industries. That presents challenges, concludes Bersin:\n\nThere is a lot of effort going into understanding the skills models that are needed in a company, and what skills are missing. We’ve been talking about the future of work for 10 years, but the future has landed. Everything about the way people work today is different than it was a decade ago. I think this is the most exciting thing I've done in my career. I've been doing this for 27 years, writing reports and selling people subscriptions and doing websites and stuff. Now people are getting orders of magnitude more value out of the content that we create using Galileo.\n\nMy take\n\nWith early adopters claiming HR managers are saving more than an hour a day using Galileo, that could make a real difference in addressing the current labor and skills shortages that companies are having to deal with. We’ll be talking to one such early adopter soon.",
      "# [Anthropic to Google: Who's winning against AI hallucinations? by Ryan Daws on 2024-07-29](https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/anthropic-to-google-who-winning-ai-hallucinations/)\nGalileo, a leading developer of generative AI for enterprise applications, has released its latest Hallucination Index.\n\nThe evaluation framework – which focuses on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) – assessed 22 prominent Gen AI LLMs from major players including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Meta. This year’s index expanded significantly, adding 11 new models to reflect the rapid growth in both open- and closed-source LLMs over the past eight months.\n\nVikram Chatterji, CEO and Co-founder of Galileo, said: “In today’s rapidly evolving AI landscape, developers and enterprises face a critical challenge: how to harness the power of generative AI while balancing cost, accuracy, and reliability. Current benchmarks are often based on academic use-cases, rather than real-world applications.”\n\nThe index employed Galileo’s proprietary evaluation metric, context adherence, to check for output inaccuracies across various input lengths, ranging from 1,000 to 100,000 tokens. This approach aims to help enterprises make informed decisions about balancing price and performance in their AI implementations.\n\nKey findings from the index include:\n\nAnthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet emerged as the best overall performing model, consistently scoring near-perfect across short, medium, and long context scenarios.\n\nGoogle’s Gemini 1.5 Flash ranked as the best performing model in terms of cost-effectiveness, delivering strong performance across all tasks.\n\nAlibaba’s Qwen2-72B-Instruct stood out as the top open-source model, particularly excelling in short and medium context scenarios.\n\nThe index also highlighted several trends in the LLM landscape:\n\nOpen-source models are rapidly closing the gap with their closed-source counterparts, offering improved hallucination performance at lower costs.\n\nCurrent RAG LLMs demonstrate significant improvements in handling extended context lengths without sacrificing quality or accuracy.\n\nSmaller models sometimes outperform larger ones, suggesting that efficient design can be more crucial than scale.\n\nThe emergence of strong performers from outside the US, such as Mistral’s Mistral-large and Alibaba’s qwen2-72b-instruct, indicates a growing global competition in LLM development.\n\nWhile closed-source models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Gemini 1.5 Flash maintain their lead due to proprietary training data, the index reveals that the landscape is evolving rapidly. Google’s performance was particularly noteworthy, with its open-source Gemma-7b model performing poorly while its closed-source Gemini 1.5 Flash consistently ranked near the top.\n\nAs the AI industry continues to grapple with hallucinations as a major hurdle to production-ready Gen AI products, Galileo’s Hallucination Index provides valuable insights for enterprises looking to adopt the right model for their specific needs and budget constraints.\n\nSee also: Senators probe OpenAI on safety and employment practices\n\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

      "# [Introducing Galileo: Next-Level Data Observability Technology by Acceldata Product Team on 2025-02-13](https://www.acceldata.io/blog/introducing-galileo)\nIntroduction\n\nIn today’s landscape of big data and complex IT systems, maintaining system reliability and preempting data anomalies is crucial for large enterprises. Acceldata has taken a bold step toward revolutionizing data observability by incorporating Large Language Models (LLMs) into its framework. This blog explores how Acceldata has developed and refined its LLM-driven data observability strategy and its impact on business operations.\n\nBeyond Traditional Monitoring\n\nData observability involves more than just tracking metrics; it requires a deep understanding and proactive management. Traditional methods have relied heavily on manual tools that necessitate significant human oversight. As data volumes and system complexities surged, it became evident that a more advanced, scalable solution was needed. With the ever-increasing number of data assets, manually defining and observing them has become an arduous task. Following the proliferation of LLMs, we observed a similar trend becoming mainstream across industries: “Employee” Agents. These agents automate part or all of the workflows associated with various employee roles.\n\nWith our Observability Agents, customers can experience the platform in three ways: Manual (customizable to their requirements), Semi-Automated (providing recommendations and actions), or Full Auto Pilot.\n\nIntroducing Galileo: The Heart of Acceldata’s LLM Strategy\n\nWhat is Galileo?\n\nGalileo stands for Generative AI-Language Integration & Liaison Engine. It is a foundational platform designed to leverage Large Language Models for creating agents that automate data observability tasks. The broad capabilities of Galileo include:\n\nAbility to build GenAI agents based on popular 3rd party LLMs, both open-source and proprietary\n\nAbility for “Prompt Management”\n\nAuthoring, Testing, and Publishing of Prompts\n\nPrompt versioning\n\nPerformance Monitoring\n\nGuardrailing & QA\n\nDebuggability\n\nFeedback Collection and Reporting\n\nAbility to Monitor the cost of such agents\n\nOverall and per agent\n\nOptimize costs on the fly\n\nOperational Managementsome text\n\nTurning on/off agents depending on the needs or preferences of customers\n\nThese capabilities allow us to automate the routine tasks that data engineers face daily. Examples include:\n\nText-to-Rules: This enables users to type in plain English, which the application converts into rules or SQL that can be configured in ADOC (DR). This allows business users to manage and observe their data assets.\n\nAutomatically generating descriptions of assets at the table, column, rule, and policy levels to aid in discoverability.\n\nDetecting column content types and tagging them (e.g., PII, phone number).\n\nRecommending rules and other optimizations to improve data quality or reduce costs.\n\nEnabling natural language-based interactions, such as, “What are my top 10 most important assets with a low-reliability score?” or “Summarize my data assets as a chart with reliability scores.”\n\nBuilding the LLM Stack: Key Considerations and Implementations\n\nSeveral key considerations guided the development of Galileo:\n\nSelecting the Right Model\n\nChoosing the appropriate LLM is crucial given the variety of models available, ranging from proprietary options like OpenAI and Anthropic to open-source models like Llama 3 and Qwen. The decision involves balancing accuracy, latency, and costs while also considering licensing, instruction-following capabilities, and minimizing hallucinations.\n\nAddressing Customer Concerns\n\nPrivacy and Security: Enterprises often prefer to use open-source foundational LLMs on their premises to maintain control over their data, rather than relying on proprietary models.\n\nFlexibility: Galileo offers the option to host models on-premises or manage them externally, adapting to various customer needs.\n\nQuality Assurance and Performance\n\nRigorous QA: Implementing a robust QA process to address potential LLM hallucinations and ensure accuracy.\n\nScalability: The system is designed to handle tens of thousands of queries per second (QPS).\n\nReliability: Includes error handling protocols and operational alerts to manage data anomalies and system inefficiencies.\n\nFeedback Mechanism: A dual feedback system refines model performance through user input and backend analysis.\n\nCost Efficiency: Balancing operational costs with scaling requirements to maintain efficiency.\n\nFeature Management: Implementing feature flags for dynamic testing and stability.\n\nMonitoring and Logging: Comprehensive systems for transparency and accountability.\n\nSecurity and Safety: Emphasizing data handling, model training, and prevention of security threats.\n\nEnhancing Internal Capabilities\n\nPrompt Management: Tools for managing and refining prompt versions and templates.\n\nInternal Democratization: Making LLM technologies accessible within the company for broader use cases.\n\nGuardrails: Establishing cost-related safeguards to manage expenses and avoid surprises.\n\nEffective Outcomes and Business Impacts\n\nProactive Management\n\nThe ability to generate SQL queries and monitoring rules on demand shifts data management from a reactive to a proactive stance, mitigating potential issues before they disrupt operations.\n\nData Access Democratization\n\nThe simplified “Text-to-SQL” and “Text-to-Rules” interfaces enable even non-technical users to interact with data and set up monitoring, breaking down barriers to data access within large enterprises.\n\nCost and Time Efficiency\n\nAutomating processes and reducing manual intervention cut labor costs and minimize errors, while rapid issue detection ensures minimal system downtime.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nAcceldata is focused on further advancing its LLM capabilities by developing robust LLM agents and expanding use cases, propelling data observability into the next era.

      "# [Bringing Together Data Intelligence and Evaluation Intelligence: Databricks Ventures Invests in Galileo on 2024-10-24](https://www.databricks.com/blog/bringing-together-data-intelligence-and-evaluation-intelligence-databricks-ventures-invests)\nOur customers say their biggest challenge in getting Generative AI from pilot to production is the \"measurement problem.\" It's hard to measure and trust these systems. LLM providers share performance results in controlled tests, but companies change the models and add their own data. This makes real-world evaluation difficult.\n\nIn the current state of AI, most organizations have moved from simple single call LLM applications to AI systems. These systems use multiple tools, retrieval strategies, reasoning steps, and business rules, along with a LLM, to create a single output from a user prompt. There’s a lot going on under the hood.\n\nAt Databricks, we’re democratizing access to analytics and intelligent applications by marrying customers’ data with powerful AI models tuned to the unique characteristics of their business. We’re leading the way in the shift from general intelligence to what we call Data Intelligence. As our users can attest, even a small improvement in the quality and efficiency of data can make an outsized impact. And with the explosion of applications built on Databricks Mosaic AI this year, it is critical that Databricks is able to offer industry-leading and scalable evaluation for our customer’s compound systems.\n\nWe’re excited to share that Databricks Ventures has invested in the Series B funding round of Galileo, a startup focused on Evaluation Intelligence for AI teams everywhere. And with this deeper partnership, now all Databricks models are natively available to Galileo users, giving our customers both Data Intelligence and Evaluation Intelligence.\n\nWhy Galileo\n\nGalileo offers a new type of Evaluation Intelligence with its Luna Evaluation Suite, a set of proprietary metrics and Evaluation Foundation Models. Galileo brings together Luna and its opinionated workflows for experimenting, monitoring, and real-time protection to empower teams with evaluations that:\n\nSpan the entire AI development workflow\n\nJust work out-of-the-box without needing ground truth data\n\nScale to millions of AI queries a month without impacting cost or latency\n\nAre equally helpful to engineers, developers, and business users\n\nContinuously improve by auto-adapting to the data unique to your use case\n\nThis allows teams to rapidly ship trustworthy applications while ensuring consistent outputs and positive brand experiences for internal and external users. Galileo has proven experience across the enterprise, including existing relationships with Fortune 50 Databricks customers and more than 800% business growth over the last year.\n\nWhat’s Next for Galileo and Databricks\n\nGalileo now offers Databricks’ latest generation of high-quality, pre-trained foundation models from its Unity Catalog, Databricks Marketplace, and Mosaic AI Model Service.

Please let us know if you have feedback.\n\nDive Brief:\n\nAnthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperformed competitors overall across short, medium and long context windows, according to a Monday report by generative AI platform Galileo. Machine learning engineers tested 22 popular models.\n\nThe Hallucination Index evaluated model accuracy, performance and cost. Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash was one of the best models for cost, Galileo said.\n\nAmong open-source competitors, Alibaba’s Qwen2 model series performed on par with one of Meta‘s Llama 3 models during short and medium-context testing but outperformed in supporting longer context sets, the report said.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nHallucinations, or inaccurate results, present a hurdle for enterprise adoption. CIOs are worried about AI’s precision and how much employees trust the tools and the results they obtain.\n\nThe majority of tech leaders are unsure if it is possible to gauge AI output accuracy, according to a Juniper Networks survey.\n\nIn the hunt for enterprise customers, vendors have beefed up risk mitigation and security capabilities as they try to stand out in a crowded field.\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei pitched enterprise and public sectors on the startup’s safety, security and responsibility in Washington, D.C. earlier this summer. Amazon, which has a minority ownership position in Anthropic, has focused on reducing the chance of models producing incorrect results when building out its portfolio as well.\n\nSAP infused its cloud-based data service SAP Datasphere with knowledge graphing capabilities meant to inhibit model hallucinations in March. Google expanded its grounding capabilities to curb hallucinations in July. And Microsoft launched several tools in Azure to increase the trustworthiness of generative AI applications in March.\n\nAnalysts say CIOs should encourage employees to deploy skepticism when using these tools and to only use them as part of initial draft stages, rather than copy and paste to production.\n\nAccuracy of AI tools is crucial, but enterprises face a number of other barriers.",
      "# [AAR’s Galileo Week Convenes Interdisciplinary Conversation about Connections Between Arts, Sciences, and Humanities on 2025-03-14](https://aarome.org/news/features/galileo-week-convenes-interdisciplinary-conversation-about-connections-between)\nThis April, the American Academy in Rome, the dynamic international community that supports innovative artists, writers, and scholars living and working together, convenes Galileo Week. This public program of lectures and conversations brings together pathbreaking luminaries in the arts, sciences, and humanities for intellectual and creative exploration in the same interdisciplinary spirit that sparked Galileo’s revolutionary discoveries. At the site where Galileo first demonstrated his telescope in Rome in 1611, this year, the Academy welcomes Edwin S. Wilsey Professor and Chair of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and founder of the interdisciplinary lab creativeX at Princeton University Naomi Ehrich Leonard, leading AI scholar and author of Atlas of AI, Research Professor at USC Annenberg Kate Crawford, composer Alvin Curran, and poet Erica Hunt to examine how collective systems—whether biological, artificial, or artistic—make decisions and create meaning in fields ranging from robotics and AI to dance and music.\n\n“Galileo Week expands upon the Academy’s deep-rooted commitment to fostering dialogue across disciplines, pushing its boundaries even further into a dynamic creative space that unites scientists, artists, and humanists. We recognize that these expansive conversations are essential not only for the pursuit of knowledge but also for uncovering fresh perspectives. Through this interdisciplinary exchange, we can model the power of the arts and humanities for understanding more precisely the complex challenges of the twenty-first century,” stated Peter N. Miller, President of the American Academy in Rome. “In addition to our public programming, Galileo Week will serve as a short-term residency program—welcoming scientists to the Academy for the first time in its 131-year history. We are proud to launch this new tradition with Naomi Ehrich Leonard and Kate Crawford, whose pioneering research sets the stage for this year’s event. We eagerly anticipate their engaging conversations with each other as well as the visionary minds of Alvin Curran and Erica Hunt.”\n\nGalileo Week 2025 evolves from David Spergel’s inaugural lecture in 2024, which was held on the anniversary of the night in 1611 when Galileo first demonstrated the telescope. This historic innovation occurred in the building whose ruins lie buried beneath the Academy’s Casa Rustica, at the back of the Bass Garden. Spergel’s Physics as Aesthetics, Cosmology as a Historical Science: From Galileo to the Big Bang investigated the connections between physics, aesthetics, and cosmology's historical nature. In 2025, Galileo Week events will similarly foster interdisciplinary inquiry.\n\nGalileo Week is free and open to the public with pre-registration at aarome.org. The program will be held in English and livestreamed.\n\nGalileo Week 2025\n\nGalileo Night Lecture: The Art and Science of Collective Decision-Making\n\nMonday, April 14\n\nNaomi Ehrich Leonard\n\nEdwin S. Wilsey Professor and Chair of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Princeton University\n\nFounding Director, creativeX\n\nIntroduced by Mario di Bernardo\n\nFlocking birds, schooling fish, swarming bees, and other animal groups that lack centralized control can nonetheless meet real-world uncertainties with collective decision-making that is fast, flexible, adaptive, and often stunningly beautiful. This lecture will discuss Professor Leonard’s theory, which shows how these complex collective behaviors emerge from relatively simple choices individual animals make in response to their neighbors and environment. She will show further how the theory can be harnessed in science and art, such as for environmental monitoring with robotic teams and for rule-based improvisational dance. Crucially, Professor Leonard will discuss how her design and art-making experiments inform the science that motivated them. Here, art and science meet and expand one another.\n\nThe Galileo Night Lecture will be followed by a conversation between Naomi Ehrich Leonard and Kate Crawford.\n\n“Rhythm Bots”\n\nApril 14–17\n\nNaomi Leonard will present a new immersive installation with video, sound, and virtual reality (VR) evoking her most recent experiment, “Rhythm Bots” (2024), a playground for human-robot interaction in which a group of gentle, rhythmically rotating robots synchronize their movement in response to one another and their audience. Video interviews reveal how a group of scientists, scholars, and artists collaborated to create “Rhythm Bots.”\n\nMapping AI: How to See Planetary-Scale Artificial Intelligence\n\nTuesday, April 15\n\nKate Crawford\n\nResearch Professor at USC Annenberg, founder of the AI Now Institute, and author of Atlas of AI\n\nGenerative AI systems are at the heart of a profound shift in how we create, access, and define knowledge. The mass extraction of data across the internet, as well as from libraries and archives, raises pressing questions about who gets to build private AI models on public data. At the same time, AI systems are reshaping the planet in lasting, often hidden ways, becoming one of the largest planetary architectures built by our species and requiring vast amounts of energy, water, data, and labor to function.\n\nThis lecture will explore the dual nature of generative AI as a cultural transformation and a material force. Crawford will also discuss her recent research project and visual installation Calculating Empires: A Genealogy of Power and Technology since 1500, which places AI systems in a historical lineage of empires that used technology to centralize power and reshape societies and ecosystems on a global scale.\n\nArtist Conversation: Modelling Collective Decision-Making\n\nWednesday, April 16\n\nNaomi Ehrich Leonard, Alvin Curran, and Erica Hunt\n\nBuilding from Professor Leonard’s studies of how flocks, schools, and swarms move, and her model of collective decision-making, she will be in conversation with composer Alvin Curran and poet Erica Hunt about the ways in which group decisions are taken in a creative and collaborative setting. Drawing parallels between the different ways in which animals move together, dancers coordinate themselves on stage, and musicians play along with each other, the speakers will explore how collective decision-making takes place in science, art, and the natural world. This will include thinking about patterns, rhythms, and social and behavioral structures that are able to ground collective decision-making in space and time."
