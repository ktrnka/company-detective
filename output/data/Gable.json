      "# [What is DataOps? What Leaders Need to Know](https://www.gable.ai/blog/dataops)\nSomething interesting is taking place in the world of DataOps right now. A big something. But what’s really interesting is what’s at play behind the scenes.\n\nAccording to our friends at Global Market Insights (GMI), the calculated annual growth rate (CAGR) of the DataOps platform marketplace is projected to grow 22% from 2023 to 2032 (i.e., less than one decade). By comparison, this is potentially 1% more than the much-buzzed-about low-code application marketplace is projected to grow during the same time.\n\nHowever, the factors driving DataOps aren’t quite as clear compared to low-code.\n\nData orchestration capabilities need to keep pace with the growing volume and complexity of Big Data, and this is part of the reason for this exceptional amount of growth. Improving customer service and experience, increasing operational efficiency, and maintaining competitive advantages are ongoing priorities for businesses.\n\nHowever, this near-exponential investment in DataOps may be due to a reckoning between two other causal trends—the increasing business need for real-time data insights and the growing impact of data governance and compliance globally.\n\nTo better understand why, let’s start by breaking down DataOps, covering its core principles, best practices, and implementation challenges within modern organizations.\n\nA basic definition of DataOps\n\nFor those who work in leadership or data-adjacent teams, DataOps is a lot like shifted paradigms—no doubt you’ve heard it mentioned while doing business. However, lacking any direct experience, what exactly DataOps is may be less than clear. Let’s correct this now.\n\nDataOps is short for Data Operations. It is a process-oriented methodology that shares and builds on many characteristics of Agile methodologies, DevOps, and lean manufacturing. Simply, the goal of DataOps is to reduce the cycle time of data analytics. In practice, it does so by streamlining collection from data sources to consumption by data consumers.\n\nBroadly speaking, the DataOps process is driven through an organized emphasis on automation, collaboration, and communication. For good reason, this means DataOps and DevOps cross streams quite often in practice. Both are instrumental in keeping Big Data and business value from being at odds.\n\nWe’ve done our best to compare and contrast both processes elsewhere. But know that exploring the core pillars of DataOps helps clarify the distinct role it plays.\n\nCore principles of modern DataOps\n\nAndy Palmer coined the term \"DataOps\" in 2015, describing it as the intersection of data engineering, data quality, and data integration with a focus on various data professionals in a given organization communicating and collaborating to increase the velocity, reliability, and quality of data analytics.\n\nWhile the concept and practice of DataOps has evolved and expanded beyond Palmer’s definition the core principles that enable professionals to put DataOps into practice remain largely the same:\n\n1. Automation and Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)\n\nThe beating heart of DataOps is automation, which aims to reduce manual efforts related to data validation, integration, and deployment processes.\n\nThis often includes automating data ingestion, testing, monitoring, and deployment within a build/deployment pipeline to ensure both consistency and reliability.\n\n2. Agile and lean methodologies\n\nPractitioners work to streamline data management processes by incorporating agile and lean methodologies.\n\nAgile’s focus on flexibility, continuous improvement, and the delivery of high-quality products in short cycles enables data teams to accelerate experimentation and adaptation based on feedback. Lean methodologies, in turn, guide teams to streamline data pipelines, minimize inefficiencies, and ensure that data delivery remains firmly coupled to business needs.\n\n3. Collaboration and alignment\n\nEffective DataOps encourages a culture of collaboration and alignment among cross-functional teams, which typically includes data engineers, scientists, and business stakeholders.\n\nFostering collaboration in this fashion ensures data products align with business needs and that data analysts can deliver all insights efficiently.\n\n4. Cloud-first and scalable infrastructure\n\nModern DataOps ecosystems should prioritize cloud-based solutions for optimal scalability and flexibility.\n\nThis principle specifically supports distributed data processing and storage, enabling organizations to scale data operations as needed.\n\n5. Highly automated and continuous processes\n\nDataOps ecosystems should feature high levels of automation to manage the scale and scope of enterprise data efficiently and effectively.\n\nIn practice, this often includes automating the cataloging, movement, and organization of data, in addition to testing and releasing processes.\n\n6. Openness and interoperability\n\nAn ecosystem in which DevOps practitioners leverage best-in-class, open-source, and potentially free tools is essential for innovation. The inverse also holds true—DataOps practitioners should avoid reliance on single, proprietary platforms (as opposed to a variety of tools that are easy to integrate and replace).\n\nThis ease of integration should also apply to a broad spectrum of potential data sources (e.g., data lakes, data warehouses) to improve data quality and governance.\n\n7. Data quality and governance\n\nImplementing robust data governance guidelines and practices is essential to ensure high data quality.\n\nAt a minimum, governance should involve data validation, cleaning, and reconciliation processes which can ensure accuracy and reliability throughout the data lifecycle.\n\n8. Ephemeral environments and code reuse\n\nEphemeral environments are temporary by nature, so using them for testing further enhances flexibility and accelerates development. As such, they reduce the risk of conflicts between environments while promoting resource efficiency.\n\nCode reuse helps practitioners maintain consistency, reduce errors, and save time by avoiding duplications of effort. Additionally, containerization encapsulates applications and their dependencies into containers that can run reliably in different computing environments.\n\n9. Monitoring, observability, and customer centricity\n\nDataOps practitioners should prioritize continuous monitoring and observability of data pipelines, ensuring data availability, performance, and security. This is vital for identifying, addressing, and resolving issues as quickly as possible.\n\nWhile DataOps practitioners focus on reducing cycle times for data delivery, enabling faster insights, and improving data-driven decision-making, ultimately everything done must remain rooted in delivering value to the organization’s end-users and customers.\n\nBeing such an elemental aspect of any data practice, it’s also beneficial to explore how other data leaders articulate their core principles of DataOps. For an excellent perspective to which we can compare and contrast the above, we recommend looking at DataKitchen’s seminal DataOps Cookbook (that is, after finishing our own article, here, of course).\n\nDataOps best practices\n\nIf core principles are one side of the DataOps coin, best practices are the other. Without them, no amount of core principles would allow organizations to actively streamline their data management processes, accelerate their insight generation, and (perhaps most fundamentally) improve data quality.\n\nBecause of this, DataOps best practices naturally intertwine with the principles outlined above. But the key best practices are still worth detailing, as they are applicable across industries and organizations:\n\nFoster a collaborative culture\n\nThe existence of departmental silos within organizations is understandable. But they aren’t acceptable. This is why DataOps best practices begin by breaking down obstacles and fostering communication and collaboration between teams—data engineers, data scientists, business users, stakeholders, and operations.\n\nDataOps makes data quality and accessibility a shared responsibility across an organization, which, in turn, sets the stage for all best practices that follow.\n\nAdopt a customer-centric approach\n\nToo often, adopting a customer-centric approach emerges as an afterthought in the practice of DataOps. This borders on being a tragic irony, as the benefits of DataOps itself—enhanced value delivery, promoting agility and responsiveness, driving innovation, fueling trust and loyalty, etc.—can only be fully realized by engaging with end-users to understand their needs, challenges, and desires.\n\nImplement agile methodologies\n\nLook to agile practices like sprints and scrums to manage data projects, allowing for rapid iteration and responses to change. Practitioners can also use Agile approaches to prioritize work based on business needs and value.\n\nHowever, it bears noting that when practitioners seek to leverage Agile as a DataOps best practice, they must ensure its impact is balanced and holistic within the organization. When employed dogmatically, these Agile methodologies can muddle the practice of proper documentation, over-complicate data management, erode data quality for the sake of responsiveness, and potentially introduce security and compliance risks.\n\nFor these reasons, make sure that Agile within your organization is used as part of the overall DataOps solution, not a solution unto itself.\n\nAutomate data pipelines\n\nActively implement CI/CD pipelines in order to automate data integration, testing, deployment, and monitoring processes. In addition to this best practice of reducing manual efforts and errors, CI/CD pipelines help ensure seamless, automated updates and deployments.\n\nEmbrace continuous testing\n\nLeverage automation to test data quality, data integration, and performance throughout the organization’s data lifecycle.\n\nFurthermore, test-driven development (TDD) approaches should be adopted for data-related code and pipelines. TDD encourages earlier issue identification and potential integration issues while contributing to overall data quality.\n\nMake version control ubiquitous\n\nTrack changes and facilitate collaboration by utilizing version control for all data assets—code, configurations, and data modeling, to name a few.\n\nAdditionally, data versioning strategies should be considered to manage changes in datasets. Doing so enables reproducibility and replicability, supports the experimentation and iteration that DataOps champions, and allows organizations to demonstrate the lineage and provenance of their data.\n\nObsessively monitor data quality and performance\n\nThe ability to identify and solution for issues quickly requires the continuous monitoring of pipeline performance and data quality.\n\nEstablishing key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics related to quality is itself key for operationalizing effective monitoring capabilities.\n\nEnsure data security and compliance\n\nData security, privacy, and compliance checks should be embedded through data pipelines to protect sensitive information while helping the organization comply with all relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).\n\nThese compliance checks also require regular reviews, and security practices must be updated to keep pace with ever-evolving threats and regulations.\n\nInvest in scalable and flexible infrastructure\n\nUtilize cloud services and technologies that bolster operational pillars of effective DataOps, scalability, optimal data processing, and organizational flexibility.\n\nIn doing so, data teams should consider adopting data virtualization and containerization capabilities to improve agility and resource efficiency.\n\nLeverage metadata management while planning for growth\n\nWork to implement robust metadata management practices to improve data discoverability, understanding, and governance.\n\nAs part of planning for future (perhaps inevitable) growth, design data architectures and systems to allow for easy adaption and scaling. Use metadata to automate data lineage, data cataloging, and impact analysis.\n\nEmbrace ongoing learning\n\nAs part of laying the foundations for future growth, DataOps initiatives should encourage team members to continually seek out, evaluate, and adopt emerging technologies and practices that will benefit the organization over time.\n\nDataOps is a journey, not a destination. As such, opportunities and areas of improvement should always be identified as part of a culture of testing, learning, and growing.\n\nCommon roadblocks to DataOps implementation (and how data contracts help)\n\nWhether an organization is just getting off the ground or has already experienced some measure of success, DataOps practices may be poorly defined or functionality non-existent. This is also common and commonly attributed to one or a combination of many of the challenges that follow. Fortunately, drafting and implementing a robust data contract can help in all cases.\n\nChange-averse cultures\n\nIt’s not uncommon for progressive thinkers to face resistance from within when trying to inspire a shift towards more collaborative, agile approaches to data management. Reluctance to adopt new processes (even those that are clearly beneficial) in addition to existing departmental silos can hinder DataOps initiatives before they can even begin.\n\nIn these situations, the data contract drafting process can act as a cultural balm, as it necessitates a clear definition of expectations, responsibilities, and roles of all parties involved in data management and usage (not just those directly involved in data analytics). The drafting process also mitigates resistance to new workflows by setting and/or codifying standardized processes all stakeholders must agree upon.\n\nSkill or knowledge deficits\n\nEven a modest implementation of DataOps requires a healthy mix of skills that span data engineering, data science, software development, and operations. Depending on their size or maturity, an organization may lack the diverse skill set and experience needed to integrate these distinct disciplines effectively.\n\nNo data contract is capable of directly addressing gaps in skills and experience. The implementation of data contracts does, however, clarify standards and requirements for data security, access, and quality. As such, they can indirectly guide employee training and development.\n\nInadequate data governance\n\nAs mentioned, effective DataOps relies on the foundation of solid data governance. Therefore, organizations may struggle to implement governance frameworks that are both robust and agile enough to support modern DataOps practices.\n\nData contracts directly support governance within an organization by establishing clear guidelines for data usage, sharing, and management. The framework for compliance and data quality standards established as they’re drafted makes governance more actionable and aligned with ensuing DataOps goals.\n\nComplexities regarding data integration\n\nThe ability to integrate data from a variety of sources presents significant technical challenges, especially in complex or legacy IT environments. This complexity can stall the progress of DataOps implementation by making data pipelines hard to manage or brittle.\n\nConversely, data contracts simplify integration efforts by specifying data interfaces, standards, and formats. This ensures that raw data from any number of sources will be compatible with the organization’s data infrastructure and can be processed and analyzed with optimal efficiency.\n\nPervasive data quality issues\n\nPoor data quality is (unfortunately) a common challenge in the business world, undermining analytics and eroding trust in data-driven decision-making. This can be an open secret too, with employees painfully aware of the issues substandard data is causing while struggling to quantify what exactly is to blame.\n\nThe metrics, validation processes, and remediation steps for non-compliance that data contracts define can make this a non-issue within organizations. This proactive approach (which is always ideal, especially in enterprise data environments) quickly becomes instrumental in maintaining high data quality across the organization.\n\nDifficulties in scaling data operations\n\nFinally, as organizations grow, it’s increasingly challenging to scale data operations efficiently while maintaining data quality. DataOps aims to address scalability issues but, ironically, a lack of foresight and flexibility regarding processes and infrastructure can prevent this from happening.\n\nData contracts circumvent these issues through the guidelines and expectations for data infrastructure, processing capabilities, and performance metrics they crystalize. This ensures that as the volume of data an organization must subsist on grows, systems and processes adapt and scale accordingly.\n\nDrafting an optimal DataOps process\n\nIt’s clear that DataOps functions best at the genetic level of data-driven organizations. It’s also clear that, given such high stakes in the market, business leaders should be doing everything in their power to get their own DataOps right.\n\nAs covered in the last section, data contracts serve as an excellent solution to ensure this happens. That said, the benefits these contracts bring to a data-centric organization extend far beyond DataOps.\n\nFor a quick, digestible, informative primer on data contracts, give Why Data Leaders Opt for Ounces Over Pounds a read.\n\nThis article is part of our blog at Gable.ai — where our goal is to create a shared data culture of collaboration, accountability, quality, and governance.\n\nCurrently, our industry-first approach to drafting and implementing data contracts is in private Beta.",
      "# [About Gable](https://www.gable.ai/about-gable)\nIn 2019, the Gable co-founders: Chad (CEO), Adrian (CTO), and Daniel (Founding Engineer) worked together on the Data Platform team at a late-stage freight tech startup called Convoy. Data was incredibly valuable at Convoy. It drove everything from a central pricing model to dashboards that powered day-to-day business operations. Despite this, data scientists, analysts, and data engineers were constantly dealing with data quality, data governance, and change management issues stemming from issues with upstream source data.\n\nAfter spending time talking to dozens of data teams, the trio realized that the data industry’s approach to managing data at the source was 15 years behind software engineering. Data contracts, integration testing, unit testing, diffs, and monitoring were all sorely lacking outside the Data Warehouse. This caused data quality issues to cascade from upstream sources into the analytical environment spurring an overflow of failed tests and randomly changing data - a problem that made data products fundamentally unscalable. Shortly after, Gable was born, with the mission of creating a data culture of collaboration, accountability, quality, and governance.",
      "# [Federated Data: Advantages for Data Leaders](https://www.gable.ai/blog/federated-data)\nRobust data management is important for any data-driven organization. But for compliance-conscious organizations (e.g., those in finance or healthcare), it is now bordering on essential.\n\nFor this reason, and in these industries, federated data is gaining traction as teams look to bolster their ability to manage and maintain high-quality data at scale.\n\nBut what about federated data specifically is making this so? What difference is it actually making in highly compliant, data-driven industries? And will data teams in other industries soon see the federation of their data as a solid option or a serious need?\n\nLet's find out.\n\nWhat is federated data?\n\nFederated data in data engineering refers to a system that provides unified access to data spread across multiple, often diverse sources without requiring the physical movement or consolidation of that data into a central repository.\n\nInstead, data federation relies on a virtual layer that connects and abstracts these sources, allowing engineering teams and data consumers to work with a unified view of their data—using it just as if it were housed in a single, cohesive system.\n\nThis approach enables organizations that rely on high data quality to leverage comprehensive insights while maintaining control over data location, governance, and compliance. For these reasons, data leaders are turning to federated data as an adaptable solution for today’s complex, data-driven environments.\n\nHow does federated data work?\n\nThe ability to provide unified access and control involving differing data sources (without any need for data consolidation) relies on four key components acting in concert. Let’s walk through them.\n\nData fabric\n\nWithin an organization's overall data environment, the data fabric establishes a singular overarching operational infrastructure. This is important, as even simple data environments (by today's standards) are composed of multiple ecosystems, such as on-premises servers, cloud platforms, and hybrid setups.\n\nEach of these ecosystems, in turn, can host a variety of data sources, including data lakes, warehouses, IoT devices, and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. The operative role of the data fabric is to integrate and manage these ecosystems and their underlying data sources, ensuring secure and seamless data integration and comprehensive data governance across the data environment as a whole.\n\nA federation layer\n\nSpecific software operating within the data fabric framework introduces a federation layer that acts as a query engine, breaking down user queries into subqueries tailored for each data source within the data fabric.\n\nThis engine retrieves the results from these subqueries in real time, aggregating them into a unified response. By doing so, the federation layer ensures that users can interact with distributed datasets as if they were part of a single system.\n\nData virtualization layers\n\nTypically, this same software will also add abstraction layers above each distributed data source in the data environment. These technical mechanisms (i.e., virtualization layers) first translate each federation query into source-specific formats before abstracting the response back to the federation layer in a standardized format.\n\nAs a result, users can access and query data through the federation layer without moving or duplicating the actual data from its source.\n\nMetadata management\n\nFinally, as all this takes place, the data fabric's metadata management maintains consistency while sourcing and using the federated data within an organization.\n\nThis is key because the metadata repositories store information about each dataset's structure, format, and governance policies, enabling the federation engine to execute queries accurately across various sources with different schemas.\n\nFederated vs. centralized data management: 5 reasons data federation comes out on top\n\nNow that we’ve discussed how federated data typically works within an organization, we can stress the strategic advantages it has over more traditional, centralized data management.\n\n1. Superior strategic flexibility and scalability\n\nData leaders and data-adjacent stakeholders (e.g., chief data officers, VPs of data, chief data and analytics officers) face significant challenges in effectively managing the growth and complexity of data assets across multiple ecosystems.\n\nFor these reasons, centralized data management practices struggle to keep pace as this growth increases the resources needed to shepherd organizational data into a single location (e.g., a data warehouse or lake). Even for organizations that can afford the ongoing investment to do this, the traditionally centralized approach can’t, by design, accommodate new data sources with the flexibility today’s data-driven organizations require.\n\nAlternately, the flexibility and out-of-the-box agility to scale that’s inherent in data federation is ideal for data leaders, as it provides the adaptability they need to evolve data sources and business needs without additional investment or restructuring of infrastructure.\n\n2. Enhanced compliance, governance, and data security\n\nCompliance-focused executives often struggle with the complex regulatory requirements of enterprise data, which dictate how organizations must store and access their data. And, here, too, the consolidation of information in centralized data management practices can cause issues. Centralization of data creates accessibility challenges (i.e., who may access data, when, and why) and heightens risk exposure, especially when data must travel from region to region or transcontinentally. Moreover, data consolidation in this manner relies on strict, resource-intensive security measures that are robust enough to protect sensitive information, especially for financial and healthcare organizations, where common use cases include real-time analytics, regulatory reporting, and cross-functional data collaboration.\n\nBy contrast, data federation allows organizations to keep data in its original location, simplifying compliance by enabling control over data location. This decentralized approach supports more agile, region-specific compliance with regulations like GDPR and HIPAA while still providing (if not improving) accessibility or flexibility.\n\n3. Improved cross-functional data collaboration\n\nThe data needs of some organizations are heavily cross-departmental. Within the walls of these large yet dynamic businesses (think Coca-Cola, Netflix, or Amazon), fostering effective data collaboration is a must for operational alignment and productivity.\n\nHere again, centralized models fail to deliver in the world of big data. In these environments, centralized models rely on data flowing through a central data team, which creates bottlenecks in managing access control, as teams must wait for permissions to access consolidated datasets. This centralization also reduces agility as other departments and end users wait for the team to move, prepare, and organize data.\n\nContrast this with a federated data model that, by enabling decentralized data access, allows departments like finance, marketing, and operations to interact with the data they need in real time without depending on a central team to manage it.\n\nThis structure supports a more collaborative and self-sufficient approach to data use, empowering departments with the Netflixes and Amazons of the world to work more effectively while aligning with organizational governance standards.\n\n4. Faster time-to-insight for business agility\n\nOrganizations are regaining agility and flexibility while staying compliant, turning this capability into a competitive advantage. By generating and acting on real-time insights faster and more decisively, they enhance the utility of their data environments. Unfortunately, centralized systems stumble and fail when tasked with performing in this way.\n\nDespite everyone's best efforts, time-intensive ETL pipeline processes may create unacceptable delays by routing data through multiple stages of transformation before it reaches its central repository for use.\n\nFor financial organizations, data delays can cost millions of dollars by compromising leadership's ability to make effective decisions. This erosion of decision-making impacts customer satisfaction and complicates efforts to remain compliant. In healthcare, these delays can be even more dire, potentially costing lives as they disrupt operational efficiency in care facilities, hinder patient care, and slow the delivery of critical health insights to those who need them most.\n\nIn these high-stakes environments, federated data systems free organizations to work at the speed of innovation by reducing latency and accelerating time-to-insight, which empowers teams to act quickly and make data-informed decisions.\n\n5. Optimized costs and resource allocation\n\nFinally, every leader in modern organizations is responsible for justifying budgets and resource allocation, especially as data volumes continue to grow.\n\nCentralized data management requires significant investments in infrastructure for storage, processing, and security, as well as additional costs for ETL operations to consolidate data. When data sources multiply, as they so commonly do, these expenses naturally increase, leading to duplicated storage and higher operational costs.\n\nIn contrast, data federation reduces the need for extensive infrastructure as it allows data to remain in its original location. By minimizing data duplication and streamlining resource allocation, federated data creates efficiencies that drive cost savings, which is a valuable benefit for any executive looking to optimize their technology budgets. That is, all data executives, everywhere.\n\nFunctionality, flexibility, and future-forward thinking with Gable.ai\n\nFederated systems are just one example of how industry leaders are embracing smarter ways to keep their companies agile and intelligent, as opposed to simply throwing more time, energy, and resources at the event horizon of big data.\n\nWhile this is imperative for data leaders in industries like finance and healthcare, leaders in every industry should consider how the right strategic investments upstream can have exponentially impactful results as they ripple downstream.",
      "# [4 Best Data Producer Practices to Improve Your Data Quality](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-producers)\nData engineering teams and data producers can find it hard to collaborate within an organization for a number of reasons.\n\nPoor data quality is one of them.\n\nFor example, a customer’s address may be recorded incorrectly, which can affect their delivery. Sometimes, there are inconsistent data formats (e.g., inconsistency between two datasets). These issues can make data integration tricky and hamper data analytics. As a consequence, you risk dealing with outages and lose a lot of time that goes into fixing things.\n\nThat’s precisely why you need to gain a thorough understanding of data producers, assess their relationship with data consumers, and follow best practices for data producers to minimize data quality issues and improve your data management.\n\nWho and what are data producers?\n\nA data producer is anything that collects, processes, generates, and stores data that’s relevant to your organization and makes it available for data consumers. This can be a user interface, service, device, system—or human.\n\nData producers serve a key role in data lifecycle as the main source of truth. This information is fed into analysis and decision-making processes. Since data producers often generate unstructured data or raw data, it needs to undergo further processing in order to derive meaningful insights from it.\n\nFor example, a point-of-sale (PoS) system is a data producer for a retail company. It generates raw data in the form of sales transaction records, including customer information, product ID, and purchase details. You can perform processing and analysis on this data via customer segmentation or sales trend analysis to understand consumer buying behavior.\n\nSoftware engineers, on the other hand, are also data producers because they develop and maintain systems and applications that generate large amounts of data. They create transactional databases, message queues like Kafka topics, and other tools that produce data.\n\nData producers vs. data consumers\n\nWhile data producers generate data, a data consumer is an entity that uses it. Data consumers copy this data, perform data transformations on it, or send it to other systems. Some examples of data consumers include marketing automation platforms, BI platforms, data analysts, and data scientists. In the case of data analysts, Python, SQL, and other tools can analyze, transform, or visualize data.\n\nTechnical overview of data producers\n\nConsider an ecommerce website that uses a database to store product information, customer profiles, and transaction records. The website's API serves as the intermediary, enabling seamless communication between the database and the front-end interface. The website provides users with a user-friendly interface to browse products, add items to their cart, and complete purchases.\n\nWhen it comes to data producers, your data follows a unidirectional path. In other words, data only flows upstream or downstream at any given time. In this example, the data follows a unidirectional flow, starting from the database, where product information and customer details are stored. The API then processes this data and delivers it to the front-end interface, allowing users to view product listings, add items to their cart, and make purchases. User interactions with the front-end interface, such as selecting products and completing payments, are returned to the API and then stored in the database.\n\nWhat you should keep in mind is that a data producer can function as a data consumer in a different context. The database functions as the data producer when it generates and stores data for the website. The API is the data consumer when it retrieves the data from the database.\n\nHowever, the API becomes the data producer when the front-end interface (acting as a data consumer) calls it to retrieve data. Similarly, the front-end interface can become a data producer for the customer who is now the data consumer that goes through the information provided on the website.\n\nData producer examples\n\nData producers can consist of any of the following:\n\nSoftware engineers act as data producers when they develop applications or systems that generate data during user interactions.\n\nSales associates contribute as data producers when they record customer interactions and sales transactions into company systems. The data they generate helps to improve customer relationship management and boost sales.\n\nCustomers become data producers by interacting with the company’s platforms via online purchases and social media engagement. Their activities generate valuable data on user preferences, behaviors, and feedback. This data helps to analyze and improve customer experience in the future.\n\nBest practices for data producers\n\nStruggling to maintain standardized data formats and failing to streamline data integration can leave your organization behind the curve and impact your decision-making processes. Data engineering managers should consider the following best practices for data producers to improve data management within their organization.\n\n1. Understand your data sources\n\nYou need to understand your data sources when it comes to data producers. When you assess how the data was created and its context, you can identify potential inaccuracies, biases, or limitations.\n\nFor instance, an automated employee attendance tracking system is a data producer. The system serves as the data producer by generating and recording employee attendance data. Understanding the data source—in this case, a biometric attendance system—allows the office management to identify any potential inaccuracies or limitations. They might recognize that the system may not be able to capture nuanced attendance details, such as the reasons for late arrivals. By reviewing these limitations, office management can implement relevant initiatives such as periodic manual checks to provide more accurate information for data producers.\n\n2. Introduce metadata management\n\nMetadata management provides context and information about the data. It helps data producers understand the structure, meaning, and relationships within a dataset. For instance, data producers, such as customer service agents, need to know how the customer data is organized with the CRM system.\n\nMetadata management includes documenting and categorizing different data types within the CRM system via a data catalog. This can help agents understand whether the data is numerical, textual, or categorical. They can also learn about relationships between different data entities. For example, it can uncover how customer data is linked to past purchases or interactions.\n\n3. Implement data quality assurance\n\nData quality assurance is an ongoing process to ensure data is accurate, reliable, consistent, and relevant. It includes using a wide range of techniques and practices to maintain and improve the quality of data that producers generate. This process involves validating data at the point of entry, identifying and resolving errors within it, and ensuring it remains consistent across different systems throughout the organization.\n\nConsider a financial firm where a transaction monitoring system serves as a data producer. The system generates data on customer transactions, account activities, and financial operations. Implementing data quality assurance in this context includes validating how accurate the transaction data is, ensuring data is standardized and consistent across different accounts, and detecting any potential fraudulent activities. This can be done through real-time transaction monitoring, anomaly detection algorithms, and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance checks.\n\n4. Use a data collaboration management platform\n\nGartner analysts predict that by next year, 50% of businesses will embrace a modern data quality solution.\n\nAfter GitHub was launched in 2008, it quickly became a must-have tool for software development teams throughout the world for companies of all scales. GitHub helped teams to manage and track code effectively in a collaborative environment.\n\nSimilar to how GitHub was highly needed for software teams, there’s a need for a collaboration management tool for data teams. Fortunately, Gable.ai fills this vacuum. Gable.ai can bridge the gap between data producers and data consumers. By introducing data contracts and a data collaboration system, the platform can help to improve data quality, consistency, and communication.\n\nFor example, if you have an order processing system as a data producer and an inventory management system as a data consumer, Gable.ai can create data contracts for them. These contracts define specific data parameters that are required by the inventory system and ensure that the order processing system produces data according to its needs.\n\nRevolutionize the way you communicate data between your data producers and consumers",
      "# [Data Debt: What Is it and How to Avoid It](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-debt)\nAccruing data debt might be the cost of doing business in today's digital economy. But, just like its financial cousin, data debt can cost a business dearly if left unmanaged.\n\nAnd, while the monetary analogy makes for a helpful onramp, it's crucial to appreciate the unique and specific impacts data debt has on organizations. While gaining this appreciation, it's also essential to differentiate data debt from technical debt—an analog that occurs in data engineering and software departments.\n\nData debt, to begin with, refers to shortcuts and compromises made within an organization related to data quality, data architecture, and data management in an effort to accelerate access to data. As opposed to creating immediate issues, data debt accumulates over time and can create significant, long-term challenges that, ironically, \"seem to come out of nowhere.\" And, while a majority of modern business models are susceptible to these effects, data debt is particularly troublesome within organizations for whom accessible, reliable, high-quality data is mission-critical.\n\nAlternatively, for technical debt, the causal decisions often involve hardware and software-related factors. While the \"costs\" associated with correcting technical debt can impact an entire organization, the damage inherent in data debt can be far more insidious.\n\nData is increasingly—if not overwhelmingly—fueling the engines of modern business. Poor data quality, compounded by an accumulation of data debt, compromises data-driven decision-making.\n\nWhat's more, left unchecked, data issues can also lead to operational inefficiencies, hamper scalability, harm customer trust, increase security and compliance risks, and more.\n\nFor these reasons, proactively handling data debt should be considered mission-critical. And the ability to do so hinges on helping stakeholders appreciate the multitude of ways data debt can damage an organization.\n\n13 symptoms that may mean data debt is sinking the ship\n\nIntegration issues: When a company moves to adopt new tools or systems, data debt begins to complicate the integration process, leading to delays, complexity, and errors. This same situation can occur when two companies merge and are forced to reconcile two drastically different data systems.\n\nProject delays: Projects in highly data-dependent departments (e.g., IT and product development) may be the first to slow down, be put on hold, or begin going over budget as teams increasingly deal with inconsistencies or proper data hygiene.\n\nSystem degradation: Data debt can begin to compound data integrity, creating malfunctions, service errors and outages, or even complete system failures.\n\nPoor decision-making: It’s admirable when an organization’s leadership tries to use data to make better decisions. But data debt can begin empowering sub-optimal strategies and actions that cause more harm than good. In this sense, no data truly is better than bad data.\n\nMissed opportunities: As data grows untrustworthy or begins to lag behind real time, leadership will also struggle to capitalize on market trends, competitive intel, or the evolving needs of their own customers.\n\nReduced productivity: Employees who end up (re)cleaning, transforming, and validating data are spending less time on their own tasks. As data debt snowballs, inefficiencies and lessening throughput do as well.\n\nIncreasing operational costs: The constant rework needed to counteract an organization’s growing debt begins increasing direct costs like bringing in more resources to help, and indirect costs related to lost time and effort.\n\nSecurity vulnerabilities: Data debt can begin to erode overall security, leading to lax user access management, inadequate encryption, or outdated data storage protocols that begin exposing the organization to unacceptable amounts of risk.\n\nRegulatory and legal issues: Common debt contributors make it exceptionally difficult to handle user data with the same level of integrity and transparency once limited to a few specific industries, like finance and health care. But, while the scope of who needs to clear regulatory bars has changed, the consequences of failing to do so haven’t, often resulting in severe penalties and/or fines.\n\nDecreasing employee morale: We’ve touched on impacts ranging from projects and processes to workflows and costs. Unfortunately, data debt can also announce itself through the toll it takes on employee wellbeing. Frustration builds as day-to-day employees continually deal with data-related fire drills, leading to low morale and updated LinkedIn accounts.\n\nDissatisfied customers: Ongoing data issues eventually leech out through the walls of the organization as billing mishaps, ineffective customer support, misleading product recommendations, and poor customer experience begin frustrating customers.\n\nBrand reputation damage: The same data quality issues that begin to eat away at customer satisfaction can also harm an organization’s reputation within its industry. This, in turn, puts the screws to customer acquisition and retention.\n\nDulling competitive edge: Companies that manage data effectively generate insights faster, utilize them better, respond to market changes quicker, and not only innovate but do so more rapidly. For organizations drowning in data debt, the exact opposite holds true. And it’s these organizations that, sooner or later, find themselves losing step with competitors.\n\nBest practices for managing data debt\n\nFortunately, despite all the factors that can contribute to data debt within an organization, there is an array of best practices that business leaders can champion to counteract debt’s ability to accrue. Broadly, these best practices can be lumped into three categories: procedural, technological, and cultural. Or, as it’s commonly known in reference to digital transformation, “people, processes, and technologies.”\n\nProcedural best practices\n\nThese best practices begin and end with instituting and supporting a robust data governance framework. To counteract data debt, this framework needs to clearly outline all methodologies, use cases, procedures, and policies related to the data lifecycle.\n\nThe governance framework should be employee-accessible, ensuring individuals at all levels of the organization understand data standards and how they can avoid contributing to poor-quality data. These efforts should also include training and workshops, so the entire organization gets on (and stays on) the same page regarding data management best practices.\n\nAs you develop your governance framework, put a system in place for documenting how data is collected, processed, and stored. Plan to use this system as a foundation for clear data lineage procedures in order to benefit from the ability to trace and map data’s unique journey throughout your organization.\n\nProcedures also need to account for data retention policies, outlining where data should be retained, for how long, and whether it should eventually be archived or deleted entirely. Audit processes should then be put in place so that data is regularly reviewed for consistency, accuracy, and relevance.\n\nTechnological best practices\n\nNext, turn your attention to tools and technology that actively work against data debt. Ideally, this begins by modernizing your data infrastructure. Data should be migrated carefully from any legacy systems to more agile, efficient, and scalable systems. And cloud-based solutions continue to make this increasingly easy to implement.\n\nConsider introducing data integration platforms to keep the merging, cleaning, and integration of data from different sources streamlined over time. Metadata management systems make it easier to manage, store, and access valuable context about data as it flows into, and through, your organization. Use data quality tools and automated data validation so that new data is validated against a specific set of standards, and corrected automatically when those standards aren’t met.\n\nAnd while access to data documentation and context should be widely available, access to the data itself shouldn’t be. By implementing access control tools you can dial in user permissions, ensuring only specified individuals can access and modify data.\n\nCultural best practices\n\nWith proper processes and technologies in place, you must absolutely address the human element inherent in an organization’s data debt.\n\nStart with buy-in from leadership because data quality is everyone’s responsibility. Without executives and stakeholders making this clear, data quality within an organization will rot from the roots up—diligent, day-to-day processes ultimately keep organizational data aligned with the truth. It’s important, then, to ensure top management commits and is ready to take accountability for their organization’s data debt. Leadership will also need to ensure best practices are funded and adopted.\n\nWith leadership behind these efforts, a culture of data ownership can actually be fostered. As employees begin to benefit from data debt mitigation, it will be easier for peers to hold each other accountable for good data management and contributing to data quality.\n\nAs this sense of ownership takes hold, encourage a collaborative environment where departments work together on data projects, as this requires unified standards, promotes data literacy, and breaks down silos.\n\nKeep communication channels open so that your increasingly empowered employees can easily suggest improvements and report data issues as they arise. Comparing and contrasting feedback from different departments can uncover valuable insights. And, finally, actively reward data hygiene.\n\nA natural by-product of these best practices is that the idea of data quality and data debt will become much more tangible. Reinforce this tangibility by recognizing and rewarding teams and individuals who maintain the highest standards of data quality and management.\n\nData contracts: 10 ways better data agreements and specifications are paving a data debt-free future\n\nData contracts can play a pivotal role in minimizing or mitigating data debt. At its core, a data contract is a formal agreement or specification that outlines the format, structure, and semantics of data. They are particularly important when different systems or services interact with one another, ensuring a standardized and expected format of data exchange. Here's how they can help:\n\nStandardization: Data contracts ensure a consistent structure, which means that data from different sources or teams adheres to a unified format. This reduces discrepancies and inconsistencies, a common form of data debt.\n\nValidation: Data contracts can be used as a validation mechanism, ensuring that incoming or outgoing data meets specific criteria or standards before processing. This can prevent inaccurate or corrupt data from entering the system.\n\nDocumentation: A well-defined data contract serves as a form of documentation that’s version controlled, clarifying how data should be structured, what each attribute means, and any constraints on the data. This reduces the chances of misunderstandings or misinterpretations.\n\nInteroperability: As organizations grow, they may integrate multiple systems, tools, or external services. Data contracts ensure seamless integration by setting clear expectations about how data should be sent and received between systems.\n\nReduction in ambiguity: With clear data contracts, there's less guesswork or ambiguity involved in how data should be managed or understood, reducing the risk of errors.\n\nEasier troubleshooting: When issues arise, having a data contract in place makes it easier to pinpoint deviations from the expected data format, speeding up troubleshooting and resolution processes. Contracts also ensure that the correct data owners are contacted based on the specific issues at hand.\n\nSupport for evolution: As data needs change, data contracts can be versioned, allowing for organized transitions and updates. This ensures that even as changes occur, there's a clear record of different data formats and structures over time.\n\nEfficiency in collaboration: When different teams or departments collaborate, having clear data contracts reduces friction and misunderstandings. Everyone knows what to expect, ensuring smoother collaboration.\n\nTransparency and trust: For consumers of the data (which might be internal teams or external partners), a clear contract gives confidence in the data's consistency and quality, fostering trust.\n\nEnhanced compliance: For industries with stringent regulatory requirements around data, having clear data contracts can assist in ensuring compliance by setting and following clear data standards.\n\nTo harness these benefits, it's essential to ensure that data contracts are kept up-to-date, widely accessible to relevant stakeholders, and strictly enforced.\n\nAnd that’s the core principle Gable was designed to address. Join our beta waiting list to be one of the first in your field to learn how data contracts are foundational aspects of a strong data strategy, effectively curbing the accrual of data debt.\n\n‍",

Data modeling: An overview\n\nAt one point in the not-too-distant past, data modeling was the cornerstone of any data management strategy. Due to the technical and business practices that were predominant at the end of the 21st century, data modeling at its zenith placed a strong emphasis on structured, well-defined models.\n\nHowever, in the late 2000s, the emergence of major cloud service providers like Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) enabled cloud computing to gain traction within business organizations.\n\nBy the end of that same decade, the benefits of scaleable, on-demand computing resources led to a proper surge within business organizations, which then led to the proliferation of what is now commonly referred to as the modern data stack—a group of cloud-based tools and technologies used for the collection, storage, processing, and analysis of data.\n\nCompared to the at-the-push-of-a-button benefits available on demand, data modeling was then seen by a growing number of practitioners as rigid and inflexible. Data modeling takes time. It can get complicated. The costs and overheads associated with the process reflected this. Perhaps most damaging at the time, it became easy to frame data modeling as a bottleneck—dead weight hampering the speed and flexibility of modern data management.\n\nHowever, this overemphasis on speed and flexibility and the underutilization of data modeling wasn’t sustainable. Though there is no specific “breaking point” to point to, by the mid-2010s, these issues became increasingly attributable to data modeling’s diminution.\n\nWhile far from exhaustive, increasingly common factors helped to precipitate this recalibration in the data space:\n\nData governance challenges: The abundance of cloud-based data storage and processing fueled an explosive increase in the data sources and repositories the average organization had access to. This sudden abundance, in turn, intensified the maintenance of data quality, security, and compliance, irreparably complicating the governance process.\n\nData quality issues: The fevered rate at which cloud-based solutions were adopted resulted in the neglect of data modeling and proper data architecture, resulting in inconsistencies, data quality issues, and difficulties in data integration.\n\nLack of standardization: While cloud environments freed teams to use various tools and platforms, the consistency of data management practices degraded, making it harder to ensure consistency and interoperability across an organization.\n\nScalability and performance issues: Without proper data modeling, it became difficult to optimize systems for performance and scalability. Bottlenecks and reduced system efficiency resulted as data volumes grew.\n\nSecurity and compliance risks: Rapid cloud adoption without adequate attention to data modeling and architecture can expose organizations to security vulnerabilities and compliance risks, especially when dealing with sensitive or regulated data.\n\nDifficulties in extracting value from data: Without a well-thought-out data model, organizations struggle to extract meaningful insights from data. Inevitably, these organizations found that simply having data in the cloud did not guarantee it was inherently usable or valuable for decision-making.\n\n2. Data modeling defined\n\nData modeling is the practice or process of creating a conceptual representation of data objects and the relation between them. Data modeling is comparable to architecture, in that the process blueprints how data is stored, managed, and used within and between systems and databases.\n\nIn essence, there are three key components of data modeling:\n\nEntities: Entities represent the real-world objects or concepts an organization wants to understand better. Examples of data modeling entities include products, employees, and customers.\n\nAttributes: These are the characteristics or properties of the entities being modeled. Attributes provide details that are used to describe and distinguish instances of an entity—product names, prices, customer names, phone numbers, etc.\n\nRelationships: The connections between entities in a data model are called relationships. They can be one-to-one, many-to-many, or one-to-many. Each entity is represented in a relational database in the typical data modeling process. While each entity has a unique identity, it can have multiple instances.\n\nTraditionally, the role of data modeling primarily focused on designing databases for transactional systems and normalizing data to reduce redundancy, improving database performance. The process itself mainly involved working with structured data in relational databases.\n\nModern data modeling is highly varied by comparison. And while its practice and process have evolved beyond some of its inherent qualities viewed negatively in the past, others are now increasingly accepted as trade-offs to be balanced against.\n\nData modeling today caters to a wide range of data storage and processing systems, ranging from traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS) to data lakes and NoSQL databases. Data models now facilitate data integration. They can support advanced analytics, data science initiatives, and predictive modeling. Modern models emphasize agility and scalability to quickly adapt to shifting business requirements.\n\nAs such, data modeling now also supports efforts in the data space to democratize data, helping to make data more understandable and accessible to a wide range of users.\n\n3. Common types of data models\n\nThere are four main types of data models, conceptual, logical, physical, and dimensional. This is true when the goal is to simplify the categorization of data models.\n\nDepending on the business needs of an organization, however, more than these initial four may be considered and utilized. We note the former simply because of the confusion this can sometimes cause within the data space.\n\nConceptual data models\n\nThe purpose of conceptual data models is to establish a macro, business-focused view of an organization’s data structure. Conceptual models are often leveraged in the planning phase of database design or a database management system.\n\nIn these cases, a data architect or modeler may work with business stakeholders and analysts to identify relevant entities, attributes, and relationships using unified modeling language (UML) and entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs).\n\nLogical data modeling\n\nLogical data models work to provide a detailed view of organizational data that is independent of specific technologies and physical considerations. By doing so, logical models are free to focus on capturing business requirements and rules without being biased by technical constraints. As a result, they can provide a clearer understanding of data from a business perspective.\n\nThe ability of less technical stakeholders to more easily understand logical data models also makes them a particularly useful tool for communicating with technical teams.\n\nPhysical data modeling\n\nAlternately, physical data modeling aims to capture and represent the detailed structure and design of a database, taking into account the specific features and constraints of a chosen database management system (DBMS), as well as business requirements for performance, access methods, and storage.\n\nFor this reason, the entities database administrators and developers will focus on include physical aspects of a database—indexes, keys, partitioning, stored procedures and triggers, etc.\n\nDimensional data modeling\n\nFor business intelligence and data warehousing applications, dimensional data modeling is often used. This is because a dimensional model employs an efficient, user-friendly, flexible structure that organizes data into fact tables and dimensions to support fast querying and reporting.\n\nDue to this, dimensional data models can specifically support related applications' complex queries, analysis, and reporting needs.\n\nObject-oriented data modeling\n\nBased on the principles of object-oriented programming, object-oriented data modeling represents data as objects instead of entities. The objects in this type of data modeling encapsulate both data and behavior. This object-oriented approach is key, making object-oriented models highly useful in scenarios where data structures must reflect real-world objects and their relationships.\n\nCommon examples of these scenarios include ecommerce and inventory management systems, banking and financial systems, customer relationship management (CMS) systems, and educational software.\n\nData vault modeling\n\nAs the word “vault” implies, data vault modeling is used in data warehousing, but also in business intelligence. Both data warehousing and BI projects benefit from the historical data preservation, scalability, flexibility, and integration capabilities that data vault models provide.\n\nIn theory, this makes data modeling a potential tool for any organization that needs to integrate data from multiple sources while maintaining data history and lineage (e.g., healthcare organizations, government agencies, and manufacturing companies).\n\nNormalized data modeling\n\nThis type of data modeling focuses on two things—reducing data redundancy and improving data integrity. This can be crucial for transactional systems where data integrity and consistency are of prime importance. Normalized models are easier to maintain and update, while they also prevent data anomalies like inconsistencies and duplication.\n\nDe-normalized data modeling\n\nAlternately, de-normalized data models involve the intentional introduction of redundancies into a dataset in order to improve performance. Through de-normalized modeling, related data can be stored in the same table or document. This reduces the need for computationally expensive join operations, which can slow down query performance.\n\nBecause of how they function, de-normalized data models also harmonize with the principles of NoSQL databases, which prioritize flexibility, scalability, and performance.\n\n4. Causes of controversy in the data modeling space\n\nData scholars agree that discussions around data modeling function similarly to a hornet’s nest in nature—both tend to cause massive amounts of pain when stumbled into. While unfortunate for the stumbler, it helps to understand that, in both cases, damage results in the attempt to defend what one holds dear.\n\nFor hornets, driven to protect the nest’s existing and developing queens, the aggression results from a combination of their innate programming, alarm pheromones, and the instinct to attack in numbers in order to intimidate and dissuade larger foes.\n\nFor data practitioners, however, aggressively defending one’s beliefs about the process and practice of data modeling is usually motivated by one or more of the following factors:\n\nDiverse perspectives: Data modeling is a field that intersects with numerous disciplines, including data science, software engineering, database design, data analytics, and business intelligence. While sharing varying degrees of overlap, these disparate professional backgrounds act as frames through which the views of “effective data modeling” become wildly divergent in the data space.\n\nComplexity and trade-offs: Additionally, data modeling tends to involve near-endless tradeoffs between competing priorities. These tradeoffs include speed vs. governance, normalization vs. performance, and structure vs. flexibility—each with passionate advocates on both sides of the aisle.\n\nOrganizational context: The “right” data model in one organization may not be the same in another, even when operating within the same industry. Differing business rules and goals, data requirements, schema, information systems, and data maturity all but guarantee that there will never be one true data modeling technique or process.\n\nSubjectivity in design: Data modeling itself can be quite subjective. Like many design disciplines, there are often multiple ways to model a given dataset. And data modelers themselves often have legitimate reasons for championing one approach over another. This subjectivity is part of why many find the challenges of data modeling so fulfilling.\n\nEvolving technologies: Despite the order and logic practitioners attempt to bring to the table, the exponentially rapid evolution of data technologies—from traditional relational databases to NoSQL, low and no-code platforms, and big data—necessitates approaches to data modeling to continuously diversify.\n\nFluctuating best practices: Due to the ever-evolving modeling landscape, its related best practices invariably need to change. Techniques once considered sacrosanct can find themselves outdated, furthering debates about what the current best approach may be at any given time.\n\nEmotional Investment: Data practitioners tend to be curious, persistent, analytical thinkers who benefit from a high attention to detail. As such, those who practice data modeling (or cross paths with it) tend to invest a great deal of intellectual and emotional capital in their work. Occasionally, this can create an environment where critiques or suggestions for alternate approaches can either be delivered as a personal attack, or taken as such.\n\n5. Restoring the model of balance\n\nThe good news is that navigating the tension between the impact of data modeling and the convenience of the modern data stack is inevitable. Organizations helping to strike the balance should consider employing the following:\n\nAdopt a hybrid approach: Consider using structured data modeling for core business entities that require consistency and stability above all. In areas that call for more agility and flexibility, employ modern data technologies that enable rapid iteration.\n\nHarmonize flexibility with standardization: Building on a hybrid approach, look to standardize core data elements and processes. At the same time, allow for flexibility in areas where rapid change can be expected. Embrace constant balancing and rebalancing of the strengths of structured data modeling and the modern data stack.\n\nUse iterative data modeling: Instead of insisting on extensive upfront data modeling, try an iterative approach. Start with a basic model, then evolve it as needed. Iteration can produce the best of both worlds, maintaining a structured approach while responding to requirements as they change over time.\n\nLeverage data virtualization: Data visualization provides a helpful layer of abstraction that allows for integrating diverse data sources without extensive modeling. In some organizations, this approach maintains agility while ensuring data is effectively understood and used.\n\nFocus on metadata management: Bridging the gap between structure modeling and agility usually involves a (sometimes renewed) focus on effective metadata management. Robust metadata curation further enables organizational flexibility while clarity regarding data structures and relationships is maintained.\n\nEmphasize data governance: When individuals are empowered to enact consistent data governance, clear policies and standards guiding data quality, usage, and security help ensure a data environment remains as agile as possible.\n\nEnable self-service data access: When implemented with appropriate controls, self-service data access supports agility by allowing users to access data as needed while still operating within the framework of the established data model.\n\nContinuous collaboration: Make sure to foster continuous collaboration between your data architects, engineers, and business users. While the passionate data modeling discussions will still take place from time to time, making cross-disciplinary collaboration an important part of the culture helps keep modeling efforts and business needs aligned.\n\nImplement data contracts: Finally, employ data contracts to provide structured agreements on data formats and interfaces. Their ability to foster communication between data producers and consumers promotes balance just as the other tactics here do—but also allows that balance to scale.\n\n6. Suggested next steps\n\nAs is now abundantly clear, treating data as a product is paramount for any organization looking to succeed in an overwhelmingly data-dependent world. Data contracts are the best way to guarantee the quality of data before it even enters an organization.",
      "# [What Are Data Contracts? What Leaders Need to Know](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-contracts)\nFounding Father Benjamin Franklin knew a few things about a few things. However, what he couldn’t know is how much one of those things relates to the use of data in our modern age—that it’s far easier to prevent a fire than it is to put one out.\n\nThis insight, the basis of the proverb “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,” came from Franklin’s work to counsel city leaders in 18th-century Philadelphia, helping them deal with particularly hazardous urban fires.\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause Franklin knew what the stakes were. He’d witnessed firsthand how panic and disorganization prevented any response to a blaze from being efficient, coordinated, and effective. And he realized that, when everything around you is on fire, success at best can only be less of a failure.\n\nSo it goes with data, especially with the sheer impact it has on modern business, society, and well, life in general. But here, in our more modern world, Franklin’s favoring ounces over pounds relates squarely to data contracts and the role they play in preventing our need for high-quality data from erupting into flames.\n\nThat said, as vital a role as they’re already playing, data contracts are a newer concept to many, even unheard of by some. So let this article serve as our proverbial Bucket Brigade, raising awareness of the value of data contracts by defining exactly what they are, how they work, and valuable ways they can be used.\n\nWhat is a data contract?\n\nA data contract is a formal agreement between two or more parties that outlines specific terms and conditions of data sharing. These contracts can exist between organizations, systems, or individuals.\n\nWhere traditional contracts exist as written or spoken agreements, data contracts tend to encompass a combination of documents, tools, and artifacts that provide clear specifications, assurances, and systems to monitor and manage the data exchange between parties.\n\nWe now live in a world where the amount of new data created each day, structured by complex data architecture, rests comfortably in the quintillions of bytes. In this world, where business leaders work to enable digital transformation initiatives and more data-driven decision-making, data contracts are proving to be invaluable.\n\nHow do data contacts work?\n\nIn practice, the formal agreement that data contracts represent will marshal the exchange, handling, storage, and usage of data. Contracting parties agree to ensure that any data outlined in the contract is managed accurately and securely, remaining in compliance with relevant regulations.\n\nThese agreements aren’t hypothetical. A contract only works if it can be enforced. This is why data contracts that involve software should be programmatic.\n\nOperationally, contracts will commonly include the following:\n\nSchema definitions: A data contract should explicitly define the schema, including semantics, so the structure of data is clear. As part of a contract, schema definitions may involve specifying which formats, structures (e.g., Avro or JSON), and data types will be used.\n\nValidation rules: These rules make sure all ensuing data adheres to the defined schema and will meet data quality standards the contracting parties require.\n\nAccess control: Data contracts may specify who approved data producers and data consumers will be for the duration of time specified within the contract.\n\nData flow management: Contracts typically outline how datasets should flow between specific systems like data pipelines and data ingestion processes. They may also determine how data should be managed as it moves between contracting parties, such as data engineers and software engineers.\n\nCommunication protocols: API specifications and communication protocols may also be outlined to standardize the data exchange between systems and platforms.\n\nVersioning: Data contracts implement versioning to manage changes made to the data schema. This management ensures that all changes, including breaking changes, will be handled in a way that won’t disrupt existing systems.\n\nDependency and metadata management: To make sure changes don’t negatively impact dependent systems, dependencies between different data entities may also be managed as part of a data contract. Data contracts may also dictate how metadata will be managed and exchanged between systems, ensuring data will be understandable and usable.\n\nCompliance and auditing: Data contracts will ensure that all data exchange and management adhere to legal and compliance requirements. Mechanisms for auditing and tracking data usage and changes can also be specified.\n\nError handling: Finally, as much as data contracts work to make sure things go right, they should also guide responses when things go wrong. Defining how errors and discrepancies in data will be handled ensures that any issues that arise will be logged, addressed, and communicated properly.\n\nEssential aspects of the contract drafting process\n\nHaving defined what a data contract is and what it should typically entail, we can turn to how they’re implemented.\n\nWhile implementation specifics of a data contract will certainly vary from case to case, the blend of technical, organizational, and governance practices will, more or less, consist of the following nine aspects:\n\n1. Objectives and parameters\n\nEffective data contracts begin with defining the landscape in which they’ll operate. At their most basic, these landscapes should include all relevant stakeholders and use cases to which the contract will pertain.\n\nAs part of the stakeholder identification process, it’s important to understand their needs and challenges. Use cases can contain as much or as little detail deemed necessary, but should at least include the specific data requirements of both data producers and data consumers. With this foundational information, the ideal duration of the data contract can also be outlined.\n\n2. Schema design and management\n\nNext, a clear and comprehensive scheme should be defined using formats like YAML, JSON, or Avro to detail data structure, formats, and types. However, know that the data contract does not need to describe the entire data schema. Comprehensive as it relates to data contracts refers to everything that will be useful and can be well-owned.\n\nDoing so ensures schema changes that occur over the course of the contract will not disrupt existing systems. Further, contract parties should align how metadata will be managed to ensure valuable context about data will be accurate and accessible.\n\n3. Data quality assurance\n\nValidation rules can then be established to ensure optimal data quality and consistency. Take email for instance—are we validating that information entered in an email field is actually a real address? Or are we employing value-based validation, ensuring for example that numbers added to an age field are never less than zero?\n\nData quality metrics should also be identified at this time. Doing so ensures all parties agree on how the data quality will be defined, which metrics will be monitored, and the role the data contract will play in ensuring adherence to these standards.\n\nWhile this step may seem straightforward, it shouldn’t be undervalued—especially considering the humbling costs poor data quality enacts on businesses each year.\n\n4. Technical implementation\n\nBased on the constraint, different enforcements of the contract, such as those involving SQL queries, will be needed depending on the technologies used. This makes sense as, for example, the actualities of protecting against NULLS in a database like MySQL will differ from checking value constraints in Kafka.\n\nAPI design should also be accounted for, as needed. If APIs will be used for data exchange, they should be designed to follow GraphQL or RESTful principles, as per requirements.\n\nA format like JSON or Avro will need to be chosen for appropriate data serialization. Plans to implement robust data ingestion mechanisms and data pipelines that will handle data flow also need to be outlined.\n\n5. SLA, security, and compliance\n\nSpecifics regarding data quality, latency, and availability will be clearly defined and minted in the data contract’s SLA. Any service-level agreement will also require monitoring to ensure adherence by all contracting parties. Monitoring and detection pre-deployment here is also essential for identifying any post-implementation issues proactively.\n\nSecurity factors should involve the use of access control mechanisms that will regulate who can produce and consume data. The contract should clearly establish how data management and data exchange will comply with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements. Working in parallel, outlined data governance policies can further guide data management throughout its lifecycle.\n\n6. Communication, error handling, and resolution\n\nData contracts should be authored to facilitate collaboration between data engineers, other data teams, and data consumers affected by the contract. This collaboration relies on clear lines of communication being established and maintained among stakeholders. Moreover, providing as much context as possible bi-directionally helps teams changing the contract understand why constraints are needed while keeping consumers aware of how and when updates are being made.\n\nCommunication is key for managing expectations and providing the right updates at the right time throughout the course of the contract. That said, a data contract should at least include the basics of how productive lines of communication will be established and maintained—and who is responsible for doing so. Error logging and a defined resolution workflow must be established as part of the drafting process. Contract owners should also be alerted if the contract itself is ever violated.\n\n7. Documentation and changes\n\nWhile the contract is being drafted, the formalities of robust documentation and change management must also be captured. While both are important parts of the data contract process, each is its own distinct element. They support the contract by providing clarity and the framework for managing changes and maintaining records.\n\nDocumentation during the course of the data contract should be a clear and clearly accessible chronicle of operating facets of the data contract, including schemas and workflows.\n\nChanges in the data contract or schema should be recorded separately to ensure they can be communicated to stakeholders as needed.\n\n8. Continuous improvement\n\nAs a data contract actively guides the use of data in a given situation, feedback loops need to be established with data consumers and producers. Feedback provides valuable information that can be used to continuously improve how the data contract functions.\n\nFeedback loops also enable contracting parties to adopt an iteration approach to making these improvements, gradually enhancing and refining the data contract as needs evolve.\n\n9. Technology, tooling, and testing\n\nWith the previous aspects defined, appropriate tools and technologies can be chosen to put the contract to work. Automation should be implemented if and when possible in order to streamline the data management and validation processes.\n\nOnce completed, data contracts require thorough testing to ensure they meet all requirements and handle edge cases effectively. This testing should also validate the performance of data exchange mechanisms under various loads and scenarios.\n\nThree use cases for data contracts\n\nFinally, to stitch the why of data contracts together with their respective what and hows, the following three distinct use cases illustrate their importance and application in practice.\n\nReal-time data streaming in financial services\n\nIt’s increasingly common for financial institutions to rely on real-time data streaming—essential for making instantaneous decisions related to trading, fraud detection, and customer service.\n\nBut, with stakes this high, data must be accurate, timely, and reliable. Data discrepancies or delays can cripple decision-making and lead to financial losses.\n\nIn this use case, data contracts provide the following:\n\nAccuracy: The schema that data contracts define can ensure that data is both available and guaranteed to adhere to expected formats.\n\nSLA management: The data contract will ensure that data latency remains within acceptable parameters and selected data sources will be able to provide and process data as needed.\n\nSecurity: The contract will also make sure that sensitive financial data remains secure while transmitted, and that it can only be authorized to approved entities and individuals.\n\nCollaborative data ecosystems in healthcare\n\nHealthcare ecosystems present their own substantial regulatory and privacy concerns, as stakeholders such as doctors, hospitals, insurance companies, and research institutions need to share sensitive patient data to function at their best.\n\nThe challenges here then involve not just data privacy and consistency, but also extensive interoperability required among diverse systems to ensure compliance with regulations like HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act).\n\nIn this use case, data contracts provide the following:\n\nData quality: In this case, the data contract will ensure that data shared among entities will be accurate and reliable—essential for both patient care and research.\n\nData privacy and compliance: Data contracts define how sensitive health data can be handled, which then ensures compliance with regulatory and legal requirements.\n\nInteroperability and dependency management: Data contracts ensure not only the consistency and interoperability necessary in healthcare ecosystems but can also manage dependencies between diverse systems and stakeholders.\n\nSupply chain management in retail\n\nRetailers engage with supply chains that can consist of a huge network of logistics providers, manufacturers, and suppliers. Doing so enables retailers to keep products manufactured, transported, and stocked efficiently.\n\nWith 74% of supply chain leaders reporting increasing their investment in technology and innovation in 2023, the need to guarantee traceability, transparency, and efficiency within retail supply chains increasingly hinges on the availability of consistent, high-quality data.\n\nIn this use case, data contracts provide the following:\n\nData integration: With so many players involved in even basic retail supply chains, data contracts can facilitate the integration of data across all relevant entities, ensuring data is both consistent and accessible.\n\nTransparency and traceability: Data contracts are instrumental in defining data related to product movement, timelines, and quantities. This ensures the complicated journey products take from manufacturer to retailer remains traceable and transparent.\n\nAutomation: Contracts also govern a seamless flow of data across the entire supply chain which, in turn, enables automation and real-time decision-making.\n\nWhat goes around comes around\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of data management, the age-old wisdom of thought leaders like Benjamin Franklin remains strikingly relevant. If “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,” the importance of proactive measures in data handling cannot be overstated.\n\nData contracts, as highlighted in this article, serve as that crucial ounce of prevention, safeguarding businesses from potential pitfalls and ensuring seamless data operations. As we move forward in this digital age, the value of such preventive measures only increases.",
      "# [What is Data Provenance? Importance & Challenges](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-provenance)\nThe amount of data swarming throughout our daily lives increases exponentially. For this reason, data quality is becoming a frequently discussed topic. Bring it on, we say.\n\nBut as data quality (and big data more generally) is discussed more often, it’s imperative that we all understand and employ key terms related to data management and data governance the same way.\n\nData provenance—the term, concept, and practice—should be toward the top of one’s list. For forward-thinking organizations working to improve data quality and use, the provenance of data plays a key role in ensuring the integrity, reliability, and value of all data handled.\n\nWhat is data provenance?\n\nData provenance refers to the information (often metadata) that traces the origin and movement of data throughout the data life cycle. Ideally, this information encompasses the history of specific data—where it came from, the processes and methodologies undergone since origination, and changes of ownership and structure along the way.\n\nThis information is essential for compliance with regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which requires clear data audit trails. Additionally, this information aids in reproducing scientific research, validating experimental results, and managing the ever-increasing complexity and volume of metadata.\n\nIn this way, data provenance is similar to data lineage because the information is essential for ensuring data authenticity, integrity, and reliability. This makes both data lineage and provenance vitally important across industries and applications, from supporting the service quality and operational efficiency of massive telecommunications companies to case-by-case applications in business analytics.\n\nDespite the similarities between data provenance and lineage, they are distinct concepts. What’s more, applying data provenance as a process further distinguishes it from its contextual cousin. So, let’s use an entertaining analogy to ensure we understand how to give provenance its due.\n\nHow are data provenance and data lineage different?\n\nTo help draw a clearer distinction between data provenance and lineage, consider this basic use case:\n\nA business intelligence (BI) team in a large organization needs to generate some reports to aid in executive decision-making.\n\nOne humble data engineer, our hero, compiles relevant customer data (i.e., customer profiles, demographics, shopper behavior) into a dataset and delivers it to the BI team, as requested.\n\nWith the data in hand, the BI team plugs the dataset into a data visualization tool and begins analyzing it, hunting for trends and insights.\n\nLet’s visualize this use case through a cinematic lens (pun intended). The BI team, scouring that customer data for said trends and insights? That’s a movie (you choose the genre).\n\nThis movie has a prequel. That’s data provenance: all the unique backstory, characters, and formative events that, together, made the dataset what it is today. The data provenance here would include all processes and methodologies the data engineer used to collect, cleanse, and transform customer data from multiple data producers pre-delivery.\n\nChances are good that our main movie will also have a sequel or two. Any and all sequels will be data lineage—chronicling the continued adventures of the dataset as the plot and characters flow on and progress through various systems, data consumers, and subsequent use cases.\n\nSo, as different yet equally valuable facets of data management, provenance and lineage help engineers, analysts, auditors, and administrators answer different types of questions.\n\nData provenance answers these questions:\n\nWho created this data, and when?\n\nHow was this data initially collected/generated?\n\nWhat standards and methodologies were used to collect this data?\n\nWhat is the original data source?\n\nData lineage answers these questions:\n\nWhich processes or systems did this data come from?\n\nWhat transformations has this data undergone?\n\nWhere will it go next?\n\nHow will this data be applied in downstream processes and systems?\n\nHow data professionals put data provenance to work\n\n1. Ensuring data integrity and authenticity\n\nIf data is the new oil, data quality is its sweetness (i.e., “sweet crude,” data’s relative value). Data provenance provides a comprehensive history of data that includes sources of the data, changes that were made to it, and who made the changes. This historical record becomes essential for helping teams verify the authenticity and integrity of organizational data. When data quality can be verified, that data can be trusted—applicable for reporting, analysis, and decision-making.\n\n2. Supporting data quality\n\nTherefore, data provenance is intrinsically linked to data quality—providing the context needed for data teams to assess the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of their data. When the history of data is clear, teams can more easily identify the root causes of data issues if, or when, they arise. This reduces the time needed to implement corrective measures, helping to maintain high data quality over time.\n\n3. Facilitating compliance and auditing\n\nIndustries are increasingly subject to data privacy and security regulations that require fastidious data management and record-keeping practices. Data provenance ensures organizations keep data compliant and secure by providing a verifiable trail of its data origins and transformations.\n\nThis makes provenance a key contributor to audit trails—when data teams need to demonstrate compliance with specific regulations and laws, avoiding penalties and damage to organizational reputation.\n\n4. Enhancing transparency and accountability\n\nThe micro to compliance’s macro, day-to-day use and reliance on data requires ongoing transparency and accountability. The audit trail of a piece of data that provenance enables also fosters trust and accessibility among data users and stakeholders, ensuring all parties are confident in the validity of the data used to do their jobs.\n\n5. Improving data security\n\nData provenance allows data teams to make sure the logs they use to track data maintain access and that changes are immutable. As such, these logs can significantly improve cybersecurity. Potential security issues can be quickly identified and responded to, protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access and breaches.\n\n6. Enhancing decision-making\n\nIt borders on the unavoidable; data is, in one way or another, informing most of the critical decisions made in organizations today. Therefore, data teams must guarantee all data used in the decision-making process is reliable and has not been inadvertently altered or tampered with. This goes a long way toward ensuring data is informing, not misinforming, decisions destined to drive business success.\n\n7. Increasing research reproducibility and validity\n\nFinally, among research, analyst, and scientific communities, data provenance is crucial to ensure the reproducibility and validity of studies. Provenance allows researchers to trace the origin of research data, understand any applied methodologies, and evaluate the integrity of their findings.\n\nThis traceability is essential for building robust, verifiable evidence and facilitating peer review and collaboration.\n\nKey characteristics of a well-defined data provenance system\n\nA well-defined data provenance system will be meticulously designed to track data as it is collected, transformed, and used throughout its data life cycle.\n\nWhat follows is a sense of how such systems work in practice and what sets well-defined data provenance systems apart.\n\nComprehensive data capture: Well-defined data provenance systems should automatically log detailed information about the data’s origin, transformations, and states throughout its life cycle. These details should include metadata, system processes, user inputs, and external interactions. Capturing detailed contextual information is key.\n\nData management tool integration: To avoid potential gaps in data tracking, data provenance systems should seamlessly integrate with existing data management systems (e.g., databases, data lakes, ETL tools). Seamless integration ensures all transformations and movements are logged without manual entry.\n\nGranular data tracking: Provenance systems should track data at a granular level, including individual data elements or records. This provides data teams with precise traceability and allows for detailed data history analysis. This is especially important when organizational data needs to undergo complex analysis or auditing.\n\nAutomated workflows for compliance and auditing: To avoid manual or reactive compliance or auditing, well-defined data provenance systems should include automated workflows to generate reports or alerts for anomalies.\n\nData integrity and security measures: These systems implement robust security measures to protect data and its provenance while helping to ensure its integrity. These measures typically include encryption, access controls, and regular integrity checks.\n\nUser-friendly access and visualization: As with other aspects of data management, information from data provenance systems should not be limited to technical users or rely on formats that are hard for stakeholders throughout the company to understand. User-friendly interfaces and visualization tools allow a wide range of professionals to easily access and interpret provenance data, increasing its value organization-wide.\n\nWhy data provenance and prequels both deserve a better script\n\nWhen the stakes are high, whether for data provenance or a movie prequel, script quality becomes vitally important.\n\nIn addition to establishing important story details, settings, and narrative elements, a prequel script needs to address more practical matters—like introducing key characters, budgetary constraints, and high audience expectations.\n\nA well-drafted data contract serves this purpose when relating to data provenance and data management in general. It handles source details, data handling specifications, quality requirements, and regulatory clauses.",
      "# [Data Collaboration: What Working Better Together Really Entails](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-collaboration)\nIt only takes a Google search (or a hot minute or two on LinkedIn) to find a long list of modern data trends:\n\nBig data and the mind-bogglingly explosive volume of it all. Competitive pressures across industries as more organizations endeavor to digitally transform. Machine learning and the use of AI becoming the rule, not the exception. The push towards data democratization. Globalization, distributed teams, and increasingly stringent and complex digital privacy governance and regulations.\n\nActing as a force multiplier, data collaboration can dramatically increase the effectiveness of organizational efforts and systems without the need for additional resources, effort, or investment. That said, there exists an exceptional amount of pressure on data engineers to get data collaboration right within their organizations.\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\nAll of this leads to a central truth: It’s imperative that organizations both understand and embrace what data collaboration is, how it functions to benefit an organization, why data engineers should begin their own collaboration initiatives by looking outside their profession, and best practices that can help facilitate success.\n\nWhat is data collaboration?\n\nData collaboration is the process or practice of sharing, managing, and working on data across different teams, departments, or even entire organizations to achieve common goals in a coordinated and strategic manner. These goals can vary but often relate to an organization wanting to increase data integration to make better decisions, improve personalization and customer experiences, or increase operational efficiency.\n\nBased on these goals, data collaboration may be applied on a case-by-case basis or implemented as a fundamental aspect of how an organization functions. But to fully understand (and appreciate) data collaboration, we must go beyond its technical definition and touch on the complicated interplay it relies upon and enables in data-driven ecosystems.\n\nData sharing, one of the main aspects of data collaboration, will often involve combining datasets (i.e., collections of data) from different departments within an organization and external data producers.\n\nPartnerships between departments and external sources will be unique to an organization, as differing business outcomes may require data sharing with a variety of data sources—suppliers, consultants, customers, research institutions, or other businesses. This diversity is important, as this pooling of resources and knowledge enriches data, leading to better, more comprehensive insights.\n\nApplication programming interfaces (APIs) play a vital role in facilitating the connection and communication between all the differing software applications data providers bring to the table. Workflows ensure data sets are collected, processed, analyzed, and utilized accurately and efficiently. And visualization tools like dashboards play a vital role, enabling data collaborators to more easily monitor, report, and make decisions based on their enriched data.\n\nBut the value data collaboration creates can’t come at the expense of data security. Data access—and stakeholders maintaining control of their data throughout the data collaboration process—is essential. So data teams must stringently manage permissions, controlling access at various levels to ensure these newly created datasets remain compliant and abide by all relevant privacy regulations.\n\nWhile the above only scratches the surface of the complexities involved, it sheds light on the interplay required to successfully implement data collaboration to drive insights, innovation, and improved business performance.\n\nThe benefits of data collaboration\n\nAgain, there are as many potential benefits of data collaboration as ways of using data. In general, within an organization, these typically include better organizational knowledge and skill development, more creativity, innovation, and better cross-functional alignment,\n\nHowever, for an organization's more technical practitioners, beneficial use cases may specifically include the following:\n\nEnhanced data change management processes\n\nRobust data collaboration helps ensure any and all changes to data structures, formats, and usage are systematically recorded, reviewed, and implemented with full visibility.\n\nThe resulting transparency and accessibility facilitates clearer communication among data stakeholders. In this way, data collaboration also improves the traceability of changes and better compliance with data governance standards.\n\nImproved dependency alerting\n\nData collaboration also enables dependency alerting to become more accurate and proactive. In turn, the organization can benefit from earlier identification of potential issues, more agility to respond to changes, and minimized impact of said changes on dependent processes or systems.\n\nHighly collaborative teams may also find it easier to automate alerts that notify relevant data consumers in real time about changes in the data they depend on.\n\nChange request centralization\n\nBusiness environments are increasingly dynamic, meaning that change requests can come from anywhere in the organization (and at any time). Data collaboration also benefits here as it can centralize the process of requesting changes to data or data practices. Further, the requests themselves become more structured and efficient.\n\nChange requests submitted through a centralized platform enable teams to log, prioritize, and address each in a timely manner. Overall, this can make an organization’s data management strategy more adaptive.\n\nFaster detection and response to broken data pipelines\n\nIn addition to consistently producing better solutions, collaborative data analysis can help teams identify issues before they become problems (and fix problems before they create issues). As a result, teams (not just individuals) get better at analyzing and interpreting trends, patterns, correlations, and anomalies related to their data pipelines over time.\n\nThis also means that when a pipeline does break down, the collaborative team is better equipped to drill down into an issue faster, decreasing time-to-resolution.\n\nData models evolve more effectively\n\nData models enjoy enhanced flexibility and scalability thanks to robust data collaboration. This fosters an environment where stakeholder feedback, insights, and emerging needs are better integrated into the evolution of data models.\n\nAdditionally, the improved alignment with business goals and increased ability to leverage new data sources often improves the effectiveness of data-driven initiatives.\n\nImproved potency of data contracts\n\nAs a final benefit of note, while drafting data contracts, highly collaborative organizations enjoy more opportunities to reduce misunderstandings or potential conflicts regarding their data use.\n\nData contracts are drafted, agreed on, and maintained with contributions from all relevant parties. As such, they enter service optimally comprehensive, clear, and aligned with the needs of all stakeholders—facilitating smoother data exchanges and integration efforts.\n\nThe valuable (and somewhat counterintuitive) starting point for successful data collaboration initiatives\n\nMelvin Conway is well-known among software developers for Conway’s Law: “Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.” As noted by the author, speaker, and software developer Martin Fowler, this axiom is important enough “to affect every system [he’s] come across, and powerful enough that you're doomed to defeat if you try to fight it.”\n\nThere’s something immutable to this idea—that the things we make are invariably shaped by the ways we make them—which is why Conway’s Law can, and should, serve as a potent starting point for data engineers to champion data collaboration best practices in their own organizations.\n\nHere’s why:\n\nData engineering often requires an extensive focus on technical proficiency and system optimization. Engineers typically work on specific systems or components within larger organizational architectures.\n\nIn these cases, user experience or user-centric design may naturally take a back seat, while the predominant roles and goals of the data engineer may not include a deep understanding of the broader dynamics at play within an organization, especially how these dynamics pertain to data flow and usage. For engineers looking to head up or bolster a data collaboration initiative, these factors can lead to several blindspots.\n\nRephrased for the context at hand, Conway’s Law could instead read as follows: “In organizations where data engineers are tasked with implementing data collaboration initiatives, the structure and effectiveness of these initiatives will mirror the communication patterns and organizational structures within the company.\"\n\nAs such, embracing our take on Conway’s Law grounds the data engineer in a mindset where cross-functional collaboration needs to be championed in addition to the technical aspects of data systems.\n\nDespite the complexity and time invested in existing projects, the engineer must realize that the organizational change inherent in data collaboration necessitates adaptations in data systems, with an emphasis on flexibility and scalability.\n\nAnd, as part of true collaboration, the pursuit of technical solutions can’t overtake the need for clear data governance structures that both support and mirror the overall communication and decision-making processes of the organization.\n\nWith this important keystone of collaboration in place, data engineers can employ best practices knowing that the foundation they’re building on is immutable as the law that informs it.\n\nBest practices for implementing data collaboration\n\nThere exists a healthy bit of overlap for how best to implement a data process or practice. Since data quality is a foundational requirement for all data activities, it should be viewed and treated as a product, not a commodity. Clear governance and policies need to be established to ensure data is shared and used correctly.\n\nThere are, however, a few best practices specific to successful data collaboration:\n\n1. Encourage cross-functional collaboration\n\nActively break down organizational silos (data silos, departmental silos, etc.) in order to foster collaboration across different departments and teams. Whatever their justification, siloing stifles the diverse data and sources that productive collaboration hinges on.\n\n2. Promote transparency and open communication\n\nWhile important in all areas, everyone involved in data collaboration, be it a project or process, needs to be accountable for promoting transparency and open communication. Build on the clear policies and guidelines established through governance. Establish feedback mechanisms. Recognize and reward openness as data collaboration begins to thrive.\n\n3. Invest in people and processes before tools and technologies\n\nIn data engineering, prioritizing tools and technologies is common. But that doesn’t make it correct. Due to the complexity and scale of data collaboration in organizations, even the tech provides diminishing returns without skilled personnel operating within a robust framework of efficient, adaptable processes. It will be the people and processes that begin to cultivate a culture of collaboration, one where technology serves an organization’s goals (as opposed to dictating them).\n\nFrom Conway to contracts: Why collaborative success hinges on better beginnings\n\nFor those seeking to harness the full potential of their data through data collaboration, the implementation of data contracts inevitably emerges as a pivotal tool. These contracts serve as a blueprint ensuring clarity, consistency, and compliance in the collaborative process, much like architectural plans in building design.\n\nAs we navigate the intricate landscape of data collaboration, the value of well-defined data contracts cannot be overstated. They are the cornerstone of effective data management, enabling organizations to unlock the true power of their data assets.",
      "# [Data Compliance: What You Need to Know in 2025](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-compliance)\nData leaders and stakeholders in data-driven organizations are already well aware of the stakes inherent in data compliance. But as the present reality within data environments becomes more challenging to deal with, it can be hard to keep an eye on what's just over the horizon.\n\nThat said, global and US state-level privacy laws are set to expand. As just one example, fines for non-compliance under the American Privacy Rights Act (APRA) may reach up to 4% of a company's global revenue. This will mirror the stringent penalties under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), signaling that non-compliance will carry increasingly heavy financial consequences.\n\nWith all the potential fines and reputation damage at play, the stakes that data leaders face would be intimidating in any casino. Therefore, access to information about tomorrow's key compliance, security, and privacy concerns is crucial to ensuring that no one in their org is rolling the dice regarding data compliance.\n\nAnd this information ideally consists of more than understanding what’s in store regarding data compliance. Through some analysis, data leaders can begin to strategize what to do moving forward.\n\nAwareness: Key data compliance trends for 2025\n\nAs big data continues to make the business world smaller, data leaders face trends of increasing global proportions.\n\nThat said, we now face an inflection point where access to the scale and complexity business owners need to keep their organizations competitive is less of an issue. The quality and ethical implications of data use, however, have never been more important.\n\n1. Stricter data privacy laws for greater global standardization\n\nAs 2025 peeks out at us from just over the horizon, so too do more stringent data privacy laws. These laws are spurring a move toward global standardization.\n\nNew regulations, such as the APRA in the US, will introduce federal standards that align with the European Union’s GDPR (which went into effect back in 2018). Once in effect, these new regulations will require companies to adapt their data compliance programs across regions.\n\nThe ensuing shift will simplify some aspects of compliance for businesses but will increase accountability across third-party vendors and data processors as a result.\n\nOrganizations must build security safeguards and transparent data practices into their compliance frameworks (i.e., fully embracing data governance as code) to remain fully compliant with these increasingly global privacy regulations.\n\n2. Broader data sovereignty and localization mandates\n\nAdditionally, nations around the world are pushing for stronger data sovereignty through localization laws that mandate the storage and processing of personal information within specific geographic boundaries.\n\nFor organizations operating globally, this trend requires revisiting data storage and access strategies to ensure compliance with local laws while avoiding significant penalties.\n\nMoreover, as more regions embrace these localization mandates, data leaders must prioritize regulatory compliance within their organizations. By doing so, they actively safeguard sensitive and proprietary data, keeping it securely stored and managed as part of their data management frameworks according to each jurisdiction's standards.\n\n3. Increasing demands for more ethical and compliant AI data governance\n\nAs AI systems increasingly rely on vast amounts of personal data, rapid integration of AI into business operations is driving the creation of new and unique compliance requirements.\n\nRegulators, in turn, are focusing more intently on AI governance to ensure data is handled ethically, securely, and in accordance with evolving privacy laws.\n\nThe resulting shift will compel data leaders to robustify existing frameworks they use to oversee AI-driven data practices—ensuring compliance with both local and international data protection regulations. Failing to do so will be unacceptable, if it isn’t already, as it will jeopardize the ethical development and deployment of AI technologies.\n\n4. Deeper integrations of data privacy and security in compliance foundations\n\nAs cybersecurity threats grow more sophisticated, data security and functionality like automated data governance are gaining precedence among the other facets responsible for robust data compliance, like data lifecycle management and risk management.\n\nTo adapt, organizations must adopt proactive measures like real-time monitoring, access control, and encryption to safeguard sensitive information from vulnerabilities and unauthorized access, both from data consumers and external bad actors.\n\nIn addition to regulatory requirements, post-pandemic consumer expectations are driving this trend, as consumers demand greater transparency in data handling, and rightly so.\n\nIncreasingly essential components of a strong data compliance program include the following:\n\nSecurity standards and access control: By implementing standards like SOX, PCI DSS, and NIST, data leaders provide individuals with only the customer data they are authorized to use, such as credit card information and other personally identifiable information in relevant industries.\n\nRisk management and assessment: Leaders should also implement a consistent cadence of risk assessments and data audits to pinpoint compliance vulnerabilities and mitigate cyber threats effectively. Proactivity is key here, as data teams who actively keep data aligned with data compliance regulations can also foster more robust information security management programs.\n\nData deletion and data storage protocols: In addition to secure storage, data deletion policies play a critical role in protecting customer privacy. Sometimes overlooked in older, more-is-better approaches to data management, data leaders who champion these policies improve organizational adherence to privacy regulations, making certain their teams securely erase outdated or irrelevant data in compliance with regulatory requirements.\n\nBy embedding these data security practices into a comprehensive compliance program, organizations can reduce the risks associated with data breaches and non-compliance and position themselves as trustworthy custodians of sensitive information.\n\n5. Better safeguards for health information through tighter healthcare compliance standards\n\nExperts predict the emergent direct-to-consumer healthcare industry will gain traction in 2025 as patients increasingly seek expanded access to drugs and medical devices without going through traditional healthcare providers.\n\nHealthcare compliance demands a heightened focus on privacy and security, especially in light of regulations like HIPAA, which governs the handling of health information in the US.\n\nHealthcare providers and service organizations are required to meet strict standards in data collection, storage, and access to protect patient information from data breaches and unauthorized use.\n\nKey factors that influence healthcare compliance in 2025 will include:\n\nPrivacy regulations and data protection laws: HIPAA, along with emerging health-focused privacy laws, ensures that healthcare organizations prioritize the security of health information and patient privacy.\n\nData collection, access, and storage: As the healthcare industry continues to digitize patient data, healthcare providers must adhere to data compliance regulations governing the storage, access, and management of health data. Effective access control, data safeguards, and consistent data audits are essential to protect patient data from vulnerabilities and ensure compliance.\n\nIndustry-specific compliance: Healthcare providers must stay agile and responsive to changing standards around patient data privacy and secure information handling. This requires balancing data access needs with compliance obligations. As compliance frameworks evolve, organizations should conduct regular assessments to continuously meet new regulations and maintain patient trust.\n\nThe healthcare industry’s unique requirements for data privacy and protection underscore the importance of compliance programs that address sector-specific regulations.\n\nHowever, by embedding robust data safeguards and adopting healthcare-compliant data storage and access controls, data leaders in relevant industries ensure that patient data remains protected while their organization maintains optimal compliance.\n\nAnalysis: Increasingly critical data compliance challenges in 2025\n\nBased on these trends, data leaders are in the hot seat—responsible in large part for helping their organizations prepare to navigate these changing tides of data compliance.\n\nDoing so creates specific challenges for anyone in these roles, including the mounting complexities of new regulations (both broad and niche), the persistent need to keep data de-siloed, and consumers who, on average, care more about the information they share online, and who expect far more transparency from those who use it.\n\nKeeping pace with stricter regulations and global standardization\n\nIn addition to APRA, as mentioned in our introduction, 2025 will witness the emergence of new state privacy laws in Delaware, Iowa, and Minnesota. These laws will further complicate the already intricate framework of regulations in the United States.\n\nAs always, evolving data compliance regulations demand continuous monitoring and adaptation to avoid non-compliance penalties, which can include fines, reputational damage, and increased scrutiny from regulatory bodies.\n\nThat said, rising cyber threats and vulnerabilities compound this challenge and force organizations to adopt stronger safeguards and security standards, such as those defined by SOX, PCI DSS, and HIPAA.\n\nBreaking down data silos to enhance accessibility and governance\n\nData silos will continue to be significant barriers to compliance in 2025. Fragmented data spread across systems or departments prevents organizations from implementing consistent security controls, such as access control and authentication, which are critical for ensuring compliance with privacy regulations. These silos also hinder effective governance and make it difficult to meet requirements for data accuracy, accessibility, and storage management.\n\nBreaking down silos enables a more comprehensive view of operations. This, in turn, not only improves efficiency and overall data quality but also facilitates the alignment of data handling practices with compliance frameworks.\n\nFor organizations that are managing sensitive customer or health information, this step is critical for maintaining regulatory compliance, particularly under laws like GDPR and HIPAA.\n\nEmbedding privacy by design into compliance foundations\n\nPrivacy by Design (PbD) is increasingly becoming a regulatory mandate under frameworks like Europe’s GDPR, Brazil’s General Data Protection Law (LGPD), and emerging US privacy laws. This approach requires organizations to proactively embed privacy considerations into the design and development of systems, processes, and products rather than applying them retroactively.\n\nBy 2025, PbD will be integral for managing compliance across industries and will ensure that safeguards for personal data—including data deletion protocols—are in place throughout the data lifecycle. However, implementing PbD can be challenging, as it requires cross-functional data collaboration between legal, IT, and product development teams to ensure they consistently prioritize consumer privacy.\n\nAs technologies like AI create new opportunities and risks, organizations will need to align their AI governance efforts with privacy regulations to address emerging ethical concerns while maintaining compliance. PbD will remain a cornerstone of these efforts, ensuring the design of systems and processes anticipate and mitigate compliance vulnerabilities from the outset.\n\nAction: 3 key strategies for adjusting to 2025’s evolving compliance needs\n\nAs it stands, data leaders should begin rethinking (or at least thoroughly considering) their current approaches to compliance. Despite high stakes, most won't need to scratch their current strategies and processes completely.\n\nThe value here is to reconcile what's worked in the past with what must work in the near future—optimizing solutions to address evolving demands to help their organizations both keep pace and stay competitive.\n\n1. Embrace upstream data contracts\n\nData contracts are agreements between data producers and consumers. They define how data is structured, shared, and maintained. As such, a data contract that is drafted and implemented upstream enforces data quality, schema consistency, and compliance requirements at the data lifecycle’s inception point. This is why data contracts are particularly critical for navigating stricter data privacy laws, such as APRA or GDPR, as well as sector-specific mandates like HIPAA in healthcare.\n\nBy embedding these contracts into CI/CD pipelines, companies can automate the enforcement of data standards, which reduces the risk of non-compliance due to schema-breaking changes or poor-quality data.\n\nThis proactive approach supports governance frameworks and ensures that organizations handle sensitive data, like health information and customer data, in full compliance with regulations.\n\nData contracts also reduce technical debt and align all stakeholders on data handling requirements, which is increasingly important as organizations face global standardization pressures and localization mandates.\n\n2. Automate your data lineage processes and audits\n\nAutomated data lineage tools provide a real-time view of how data moves through an organization, from its origin to its final destination. Transparent data flows are essential for demonstrating compliance with evolving data compliance regulations—such as GDPR or PCI DSS—and meeting industry-specific requirements, including those in the payment card industry or healthcare.\n\nAutomated lineage tools simplify compliance reporting by creating audit trails that regulators can review efficiently. These tools also ensure that data deletion and access protocols align with privacy regulations. As regulations grow more complex in 2025, real-time monitoring and lineage automation will be critical for identifying vulnerabilities, ensuring compliance across data lifecycles, and reducing the manual burden on compliance teams.\n\n3. Invest in staff training and promote optimal awareness\n\nHuman error remains a significant factor in compliance failures and data breaches. Training employees on evolving regulations, cybersecurity best practices, and internal compliance protocols is essential to mitigate this risk. In sectors like healthcare, where compliance with HIPAA and privacy-focused regulations is paramount, staff awareness plays a critical role in protecting health information.\n\nRegular training programs help organizations adapt to regulatory changes and foster a culture of privacy and data integrity. This approach ensures that employees understand their responsibilities in managing sensitive data, from implementing access controls to adhering to secure data storage and deletion standards.\n\nPlanning ahead: Future-proof your organization’s compliance framework by shifting data left\n\nMoving forward into 2025, we can agree that proactive and integrated data compliance will be essential, not optional. VPs of data must lead the way by building scalable, adaptable compliance frameworks that meet regulatory demands and protect organizational trust.\n\nBut for these leaders, it’s of critical importance to understand that high stakes are best managed well before cards ever hit the table. The answers here are upstream, embracing tools and technologies that prevent data compliance from becoming a gamble in the first place.",
      "# [Database Schema: The Need for (and Risks of) Iterative Evolution](https://www.gable.ai/blog/database-schema)\nThe humble, foundational aspects of data environments make it possible for modern tools, solutions, and platforms to scale and adapt to our ever-evolving digital world.\n\nAnd while it’s understandable that an abundance of digital ink will be spilled to cover new frontiers, let’s not forget that said foundational aspects and their need to keep pace are just as important, if not more so.\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\nFor organizations of all sizes, database schema serves as a critical blueprint that dictates the functional structure of data management.\n\nThis is especially true for startups and smaller organizations, where data can be a significant driver of innovation and growth.\n\nDatabase schema, defined\n\nA database schema acts as the blueprint within a relational database management system (DBMS), outlining its logical structure and organization. Schemas are often defined using data definition language (DDL), which provides a clear, consistent way to define how data is stored in tables.\n\nDatabase schemas also define the relationships between these tables, incorporating integrity constraints to establish and maintain optimal data quality. Such organization makes efficient data retrieval, query optimization, and overall performance management possible, playing a crucial role in database design and operation.\n\nTo do so, database schema typically encompasses a wide range of database objects (but certainly not all of them). Schema primarily focuses on the specific database objects needed to define a given database’s structure and organization.\n\nTypically, these objects will include the following:\n\nTables: The core components of a database schema, tables store data in rows and columns, with each table representing a set of related data.\n\nIn the context of data warehouses or multidimensional database models, schemas often include more specialized “fact tables.” These specialized tables are designed to store quantitative data for analysis, known as facts, and often contain keys that link to related dimension tables, which store descriptive attributes.\n\nColumns: Within tables, columns (also known as fields) represent the attributes or properties of the data. Each column in a table is designed to store a specific type of data (e.g., integers, text, dates, etc.).\n\nRows: Individual records in a table are represented as rows, where each row in a table contains unique data for the corresponding columns.\n\nPrimary keys: These are special fields that uniquely identify each record in a table. A primary key ensures that each row in a table is distinct from all others.\n\nForeign keys: Fields in a table that link to primary keys in other tables are called foreign keys. These keys establish relationships between tables and are crucial for maintaining referential integrity within a database.\n\nIndexes: Functioning as an “address book” of sorts, indexes guide databases to the location of needed data more quickly. This functionality speeds up overall data retrieval from the database.\n\nStored procedures and functions: These are sets of SQL statements that perform tasks like calculations and data manipulation that are frequently reused.\n\nViews: A view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement. Just like a real table, views contain rows and columns. However, views are created with the data from one or more tables.\n\nConstraints: Constraints are rules that ensure the data in the database remains accurate and reliable.\n\nTriggers: Scripts that are automatically executed in response to certain events are referred to as triggers on a particular table or view in the database.\n\nAll together, these are the components that enable schema to function as the metaphorical blueprint, keeping databases optimally structured as their data is stored, organized, and managed.\n\nA note on schema types: While they often focus on similar data objects, different schemas may vary depending on the nature of the data being used and the requirements of their respective systems. In exploring the types of database schemas, database administrators may use a conceptual or logical schema during the planning phase.\n\nHowever, they may transition to a physical schema for implementation and then a physical database schema to manage the physical aspects of the database when it’s put into use. Data scientists and business analysts, on the other hand, might rely on star schema to enable complex queries or snowflake schema if data integrity and reduction of data redundancy take precedence.\n\nThe need for iterative schema evolution\n\nIterative schema evolution is a critical aspect of successfully implementing and managing a database, particularly in dynamic environments where business requirements and data models are subject to change. Its importance can be understood in relation to other key factors in database management:\n\nAdaptability to changing requirements: One of the most significant challenges in database management is the continuous need to adapt to evolving business needs. Iterative schema evolution allows for gradual, controlled modifications to the database schema, ensuring that it can keep pace with changing requirements without disrupting ongoing operations.\n\nData integrity and consistency: While maintaining data integrity and consistency is vital, overly rigid schema designs can hinder necessary changes. Iterative schema evolution, when done correctly, allows for schema modifications while maintaining data integrity through versioning, migration scripts, and backward compatibility.\n\nPerformance optimization: Over time, it's common for the performance requirements of a given database to change. Iterative schema evolution enables incremental adjustments to optimize performance, such as indexing strategies and partitioning, without the need for a complete overhaul.\n\nScalability: As the volume of data grows, a database schema might need to be adjusted to scale effectively. Iterative evolution allows for scaling-related changes, such as denormalization or sharding, to be implemented as needed.\n\nCompatibility with development practices: Modern development practices, such as Agile and DevOps, emphasize continuous improvement and rapid iteration. Iterative schema evolution aligns well with these methodologies, allowing database schema changes to be integrated into the broader development lifecycle.\n\nRisk management: By enabling small, incremental changes, iterative schema evolution reduces the risk associated with large-scale database modifications. It allows for easier rollback, testing, and validation of changes.\n\nThe risks of iterative schema evolution\n\nAttempting to enable iterative schema evolution without a data contract in place does, unfortunately, present several challenges and risks.\n\nThese risks are amplified in environments where data integrity, consistency, and compliance are crucial:\n\nLack of predictability and standardization: Without support, changes to the data schema can occur in an ad-hoc, inconsistent manner. The unpredictability this introduces can lead to issues in data quality and compatibility, especially when logical constraints are not uniformly applied across multiple teams or systems.\n\nData integrity risks: Sporadic schema changes can lead to data integrity issues. If a field's data type is altered without proper synchronization, for example, it could lead to data loss or corruption.\n\nCompliance violations: In regulated industries or under laws like GDPR or CCPA, organizational data needs to be handled according to specific guidelines. Iterative schema changes can inadvertently lead to non-compliance, resulting in legal and financial repercussions.\n\nIncreased testing and validation overhead: Schema changes require extensive testing and validation to ensure they don’t break existing systems. While important, this process becomes more complex and time-consuming as a database needs to evolve, as there are no predefined rules or expectations to test against.\n\nDependency management issues: In a microservices architecture or in systems with multiple data sources, changes in one part often affect others. Managing these dependencies over time compounds testing complexity while the subsequent risks of system failures or downtime increase.\n\nDifficulty in rollbacks: If a schema change leads to issues, a rollback may be required. However, this operation becomes difficult when no record of the previous schema state is available, or when data may have already been transformed in a way that is not easily reversible.\n\nImpact on data consumers: Applications or services consuming the data may face issues if they are not aware of or prepared for schema changes. This can lead to system errors, application crashes, or incorrect data processing.\n\nScaling challenges: As an organization’s systems scale, managing schema evolution takes an increasing toll on data teams. Moreover, as the volume of organizational data and the number of interconnected services increases, the complexity and risk of making changes without breaking existing functionalities also grows exponentially.\n\nWhy your database blueprints deserve their own blueprint\n\nData leaders in organizations of all sizes need to embrace the reality that their database will need to evolve. Therefore, any means or method that can mitigate the risks of iterative schema evolution should be embraced as well.\n\nEnter data contracts. For database designers and data engineers, these contracts can support the design of a database schema, not just its management.\n\nData contracts: Advantages for schema design\n\n1. Defining data structure and format\n\nEarly specification: Data contracts can provide an early specification of the data structure, including data types, formats, and fields, guiding the normalization process in database design. This helps in designing database tables and relationships that align with these specifications.\n\nConsistency across systems: When a database needs to interact with other systems, a data contract ensures that the schema is designed in a way that is compatible and consistent with these external systems.\n\n2. Setting standards and constraints\n\nData integrity: By defining the rules and constraints for data, contracts help in designing schemas that inherently support data integrity and validity.\n\nStandardization: Data contracts often include standardization rules, which are crucial in designing a schema with consistent syntax and structure.\n\n3. Guiding relationships and dependencies\n\nRelationship mapping: Contracts can outline the relationships between different data entities, providing a clear visual representation through an entity-relationship diagram in the schema design process.\n\nDependency management: Understanding the dependencies between different data elements as specified in a contract helps in designing a schema that efficiently manages these dependencies.\n\n4. Facilitating scalability and evolution\n\nFuture-proofing: Data contracts can include provisions for future changes, which can guide the design of a flexible and scalable schema.\n\nIterative development: As contracts may evolve, designing a schema with the ability to accommodate these changes is crucial. Data contracts provide guidelines on how the schema should adapt, ensuring it remains relevant and functional over time.\n\n5. Ensuring compliance and security\n\nCompliance: Data contracts often outline requirements for compliance with regulations. This can be integrated into the schema design to ensure that data storage and processing meet legal standards.\n\nSecurity protocols: Contracts may specify security protocols or encryption standards, which can be considered in the schema design to ensure data is stored and accessed securely.\n\n6. Data governance\n\nGovernance framework: Data contracts often form part of a broader data governance strategy. Designing a schema with these contracts in mind helps align it with the organization's data governance policies, ensuring the effective organization of data.\n\nRole and access management: Data contracts may define roles and access levels for database users, which can influence the design of the schema in terms of access controls and data segregation.\n\n7. Optimizing performance and efficiency\n\nPerformance requirements: Contracts can specify performance requirements, guiding the design of efficient indexes, optimized query paths, and streamlined data structures.\n\nResource management: Understanding the expected data load and usage patterns from the contract can guide decisions on resource allocation and optimization in the schema design.\n\nReady to support your own database schemas? Here’s how to get started\n\nCompared to larger organizations, smaller organizations and startups often require wearing multiple hats, achieving more with less, and just doing what it takes to get the work done. That’s why it’s simply not worth leaving database schema unsupported, which effectively creates little ticking time bombs tucked away in some of the most vulnerable aspects of your data infrastructure.\n\nFortunately, we’re improving the process required to draft and implement a top-notch data contract, in part because everyone in our data-driven world (not just enterprise organizations) deserves the security and operational support they provide.\n\nReserve your spot now to learn more about Gable and how you can create a preventative strategy with data contracts.\n\n‍",
      "# [How to Think About Data Quality](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-quality)\nBig data is big enough that, yes, it still warrants the occasional media story or captivating infographic. But, increasingly, our collective attention needs to focus far more on the quality—not quantity—of data.\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\nHowever, good data quality doesn’t manifest itself. Management of specific factors and categories by data governance teams, data stewards, and the like is essential to ensure data from producers consistently reaches consumers in its optimal form.\n\nThis is why any data quality initiative should arguably begin with internal alignment on what those factors and categories entail.\n\nWhat are the 5 characteristics of data quality?\n\nLike many aspects of data engineering and science, the concept of data quality is quite simple until two professionals sit down to discuss it. Professionals of varying specialties and experience will, understandably, emphasize different characteristics concerning data quality they consider more important.\n\nBut at a very foundational level, we can define the quality of a specific dataset by evaluating five key characteristics:\n\nAccuracy: How accurate is the data at hand? Data values should represent the real-world event or instance it exists to depict.\n\nConsistency: High-quality data contains no contradictions across a given dataset or system.\n\nReliability: Referring to the trustworthiness of data sources, the reliability of a source can often be determined through data lineage.\n\nTimeliness: Whenever required, data is both up-to-date and available.\n\nUniqueness and completeness: Quality data is whole, with no missing values or parts.\n\nWhat are the 4 categories of data quality?\n\nTaken together, data quality characteristics allow us to quantify the quality of data flowing from producers to consumers. However, a categorical lens also provides valuable context for data governance when paired with the five factors above. Traditionally, these categories are organized to address specific areas of concern or dimensions.\n\nAs such, the four most common categories are as follows:\n\nAvailability and accessibility issues: Can the data be used when needed? Can it also be accessed by those who need it (and inaccessible to those who don’t)? In addition to permissions structures and security protocols, this category includes issues like system errors and data outages.\n\nAccuracy and integrity issues: Here we focus on whether the data is reliable and correct. Can it be trusted? Addressing this category typically involves correcting for inconsistencies, inaccuracies, and whether or not the relationships between datasets maintain their integrity.\n\nConformity issues: This category covers whether a dataset or system conforms to a predefined standard or set of business rules based on particular formats, standards, or patterns.\n\nRelevancy, completeness, and timeliness issues: This final category of data quality focuses on whether or not the data is current, complete in terms of covering all necessary aspects, and relevant to its intended use.\n\nIt bears repeating that these characteristics and categories are in no way mutually exclusive.\n\nFor instance, the characteristic of data \"completeness” can be seen in both the relevancy/completeness/timeliness and accuracy/integrity categories. While the quality characteristic of “reliability” also naturally slots into the accuracy/integrity category, it also relates to availability/accessibility issues.\n\nThe point is whether they’re characteristics or categories or both, use whichever makes the most sense based on your needs and the needs of your organization.\n\nThe five data quality characteristics might make more sense for metrics and measurement or data profiling. In contrast, the four categories may be more useful for data governance or managing stakeholder expectations.\n\nCharacteristics and categories, leveraged in tandem, can also support a balanced and effective approach to managing data quality in diverse scenarios.\n\nData quality vs. data integrity\n\nIt’s also important to clarify the difference between data quality and data integrity, as the nouns quality (how good or bad something is) and integrity (the quality of being honest and having immutable moral principles) can be used synonymously in some situations. However, regarding data, they are significantly different.\n\nHere's how:\n\nData quality, as we've defined above, refers to the condition or state of data at a given point in time. Being a finite measurement, the level of quality relates to the data's value as it can be used in specific, intended instances—such as in business operations, planning, or decision-making.\n\nData integrity, however, refers to the accuracy and consistency of data across its entire lifecycle. Does quality data from a reliable source fundamentally remain unchanged and unaltered once it's been ingested into an organization? And has it been accidentally or maliciously tampered with or corrupted? These are questions of data integrity.\n\nOther differences between quality and integrity relate to scope, implementation, overall concerns, and security issues related to data. In this sense, data quality and data integrity both relate to the reliability and trustworthiness of data.\n\nTogether, those contributing to data management have a way of referring to the usability of their data (data quality), and their ability to trust its quality will be consistent over time (data integrity).\n\nThe mission-critical impact data quality has on business\n\nAs is obvious now, data quality can have a profound effect on business initiatives and operations—both positive and negative.\n\nBenefits of high data quality\n\nMore efficient operations: High-quality data helps to streamline processes, reduce operational errors, and can lead to cost savings. The potency of data analytics, reporting, and forecasting also hinges on the availability of high-quality data.\n\nImproved decision-making: Timely, accurate, reliable data ensures that data-informed business decisions are grounded in reality, leading to better strategic decisions and outcomes.\n\nBetter customer relations: Accurate customer data enables businesses to tailor their offers, services, and communication to consumers, increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n\nCompliance and mitigated risks: Reliable, high-quality data reduces the risk of penalties and legal consequences by helping businesses comply with various regulations.\n\nIncreased trust: Organizations that prioritize high data consistency and quality data assets are more easily seen as trustworthy and reliable, which can strengthen their brand reputation in-market.\n\nInnovation fuel: Advanced analytics, AI, and machine learning processes live or die based on the reliability of data they have access to. So, too, does their ability to support innovative or completely new data-driven products and solutions.\n\nIncreased revenue: Ultimately, high-quality data can increase revenue as it enables more accurate pricing strategies, better campaign targeting, and the continual improvement of sales processes.\n\nIssues stemming from low data quality\n\nOperational inefficiencies: Stakeholder and business intelligence initiatives based on outdated or inaccurate data can produce poor—if not outright detrimental—business processes and outcomes.\n\nIncreased costs: Low-quality, inconsistent data leads to more mistakes, data discrepancies, and handling issues. And costs due to rework and remediation can get out of hand quickly.\n\nHindered digital initiatives: Poor data can grind digital transformation efforts to a halt, especially in cases where an organization wishes to leverage the benefits of advanced data-reliant technologies like artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nCompliance risks: Bad data can result in regulatory violations. And, in industries where data accuracy is paramount, organizations can face reputational damage and financial penalties.\n\nLoss of trust: Regular errors, issues, and inaccuracies can erode trust in general, both with stakeholders internally and customers externally.\n\nCustomer dissatisfaction: Flawed customer data can lead to miscommunication, bad targeting and personalization efforts, or errors in service delivery. For increasingly digitally savvy consumers, the resulting dissatisfaction can quickly lead to loss of business.\n\nDecreased revenue: A sustained lack of access to high-quality data can ultimately result in ineffective marketing campaigns, decreased sales effectiveness, and missed opportunities.\n\nHow to measure data quality\n\nData quality management, be it more or less formally practiced, should be considered table stakes in any modern business environment, not just in situations where data-driven decisions need to be accurate and effective.\n\nBut that doesn't mean measuring the quality of data is easy to do (especially at scale). After all, the idea of \"quality\" can sometimes be frustratingly subjective. Fortunately, utilizing a data quality assessment is an excellent way to both quantify what quality data means in the context of one's organization and assess it using multiple dimensions of data quality.\n\nPerforming a data quality assessment involves a series of sequential steps, the basics of which we've outlined here:\n\n1. Define your criteria\n\nBefore jumping into measurement, start by outlining clear criteria based on business needs. Based on those needs, outline which aspects of data quality are most relevant (i.e., which characteristics—be they five, or more, or less).\n\n2. Develop key performance indicators (KPIs)\n\nDetermine which KPIs can best be used to measure each aspect of data quality you’ve outlined as part of your criteria. Using our five characteristics to illustrate, these KPIs might be established by the following actions:\n\nComparing a sample of your data against a trusted source or standard, then using the percentage that matches to represent data accuracy.\n\nCalculating the percentage of missing data in a dataset to represent data completeness.\n\nQuantifying any identified discrepancies within a dataset or between datasets to represent data consistency.\n\nTracking the number of times a data source provides incorrect information or suffers outages to represent data reliability.\n\nMeasuring the delay between when data is generated and when it becomes available for use to represent data timeliness.\n\n3. Implement continuous monitoring\n\nAdd continuous monitoring tools to the mix as well, as they will help you constantly check and report on how the quality of your data is—or is not—improving over time based on your specific KPIs. To best do so, we always recommend establishing monitoring as early as possible. Setting up alerts to inform you of any significant deviations is also beneficial.\n\n4. Establish feedback loops\n\nWork needed to keep something from breaking is always preferable to working to fix what’s broken. This is why the time and effort required to establish feedback loops is well spent. Enabling data consumers to report anomalies or issues they encounter is valuable. But the fact that feedback loops keep data producers and consumers in lockstep—more often identifying problems before they become problematic—is invaluable.\n\n5. Implement data profiling tools\n\nData profiling tools analyze data to provide a statistical summary while highlighting inconsistencies or anomalies. The information provided can provide insights regarding outliers, patterns, and potential quality issues. Ultimately, however, profiling tools prove invaluable for helping teams identify and resolve issues as quickly as possible.\n\n6. Score data quality\n\nData quality scorecards can prove invaluable for clearly displaying the result of your ongoing data quality measurements against benchmarks you set. When used correctly, these scorecards also make it easier for stakeholders to understand the current state of the organization's data quality. Ideally, data quality scores should also be tied back to specific data products.\n\n7. Audit regularly\n\nAuditing can be periodic. But they should occur consistently, as the deep dives they require can reveal system issues that tend not to appear in day-to-day checks.\n\n8. Benchmark externally\n\nWhenever possible, compare your data quality metrics with industry standards or benchmarks. Doing so provides valuable context, helping you maintain a sense of where you stand relative to industry peers and best practices.\n\n9. Conduct a business impact analysis\n\nA business impact analysis can help you measure the actual bottom-line-impact data quality issues are having within your organization. In instances where poor data quality led to a flawed business decision, the cost implications of that decision should be made apparent.\n\n10. Review regularly (and continuously adapt)\n\nAs communication is a key aspect of maintaining high-quality data, review your measurement strategies to account for how data sources, tools, stakeholder expectations, and the overall business environment evolve.\n\nIf nothing else, when you keep stakeholders aware of the impact of data quality on business outcomes, they're more likely to support and participate in your quality improvement initiatives.\n\nThe best way to improve data quality\n\nBased on the above, ensuring data quality is less of a singular task and more of a continuous journey. And the process of managing data quality is fundamentally intertwined with the tools and strategies employed in its management, such as data quality tools that scrutinize and enhance accuracy, feedback mechanisms that perpetually refine it, and master data management (MDM) that ensures its consistency and accuracy across the organization.\n\nTruly, the quality of data as it moves downstream to consumers is dependent on its quality when it enters an organization. More specifically, if data from producers is flawed, the resulting analyses, decisions, and strategies it’s used for will be, too.\n\nThis brings us to a pivotal solution: data contracts. These can be seen as the vigilant gatekeepers ensuring that only the finest, most pristine data enters your organization's repositories.\n\nWhy data contracts are quintessential for high-quality data\n\nEnsuring consistency: Data contracts establish a standardized format, ensuring incoming data adhere to predetermined quality and structural benchmarks. With clear data expectations and the assurance of data quality and accuracy, organizations can collaborate more effectively.\n\nMinimizing errors: By defining the acceptable data parameters, data contracts inherently reduce the influx of erroneous data, safeguarding analytical outcomes.\n\nIntegration testing: Contracts enable teams to check upstream in a CI/CD pipeline before any breaking issues occur. This also helps bring data producers and consumers together, improving data collaboration and the general understanding of its use.\n\nEnhancing compliance: Data contracts ensure that data adheres to regulatory and organizational standards, mitigating compliance risks.\n\nOptimizing data management: By ensuring that only quality data enters the system, data management processes are streamlined and optimized.\n\nWith the stakes so high, quality should be contractual\n\nIn modern organizations, there will always be an alarming amount of things we simply can’t control. Often, these things add up to become the proverbial cost of doing business. This is why that which we can control deserves all the more investment—especially when, as data does, it can make all the difference in organizational success or failure.",
      "# [What is Data Lineage? Tools, Techniques, Examples](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-lineage)\nWhen data becomes more complex, big data analytics also becomes more complex—and, in turn, data compliance and regulations are even more complex.\n\nAnd this all ripples to affect the complexity of data governance.\n\nWhile data-driven decision-making actually becomes easier, maintaining competitive data advantages becomes more difficult. Access to quality data is already vital, but understanding how an organization uses that quality data is now essential.\n\nEnter: Data lineage.\n\nWhat is data lineage?\n\nData lineage refers to how specific data is used and transformed over time. Data professionals employ data lineage practices to record and share this data use and transformation as it occurs.\n\nTime out: How is data lineage different from data provenance and data governance?\n\nOne of the challenges of data management is that you can’t break out aspects of the data lifecycle and affix each to specific periods of time—past, present, or future.\n\nThis is why we sometimes find data, especially in large complex systems, to be a perceptual challenge. We can’t cleanly break it down into easily categorical chunks. For this reason, it can seem like all data (e.g., data flows, data assets, data environments, etc.) can, at times, be proverbially everything, everywhere, all at once.\n\nHowever, with data’s growing role in our lives, it’s important everyone works to understand these fundamental aspects of data management—as our collective ability to ensure data security, compliance, and data-driven decision-making relies on it.\n\nFortunately, we can use our new book on data contracts (now available in early release from our friends at O’Reilly Media) as an illustrated example of how provenance, governance, and lineage all relate.\n\nProvenance: Data Contracts: Developing Production-Grade Pipelines at Scale has two authors and a unique editorial history. The record of this authorship and editorial history over time is like the book’s data provenance.\n\nGovernance: Our publisher, O’Reilly, sets forth specific guidelines and standards—a prescribed framework—determining how the book should be used, secured, and maintained. These guidelines and standards also ensure the level of quality the book must aspire to. As such, this framework acts as the book’s governance.\n\nLineage: Finally, we want the book to find its way into the hands of people who will love it. Our distribution plan to make this happen can be mapped (i.e., tracked)—clearly showing how the book goes on to reach readers, where it is sent (both on and offline), who distributes it, and how it moves through various systems and processes as a distinct body of work. This map is the book’s lineage, and as such, the map becomes essential for troubleshooting, measuring the book’s impact, and analyzing any dependencies related to it.\n\nWhile the above hopefully parses the different roles that provenance, governance, and lineage play in effective data management, our hope is that it also illustrates their interdependencies—how each of the three functionalities improves the other two when orchestrated together.\n\n9 Common types of data lineage\n\nNow that we’ve simplified things, let’s go ahead and complicate them again (just a bit).\n\nIn data management, there are many different kinds of data lineage. There need to be—because different stakeholders and departments within an organization can use the same data in very different ways. And knowing everything about all data all the time isn’t necessary (despite what that one data analyst two cubicles over would have you believe).\n\nDepending on these varying user requirements and perspectives, some aspects, dimensions, and attributes will make more sense to map in one instance, and less (or not at all) in another. To this, other factors determining what should or should not be mentioned include data complexity, regulatory compliance, data governance, and strategy, among others. This leads us to nine common types of data lineage in use across organizations.\n\nBackward lineage: This type of data lineage traces the data flow from a given point back to its point of origin. Doing so can help data teams verify data quality related to different data outputs (e.g., data sets, reports, analytics results, etc.).\n\nForward lineage: By tracing data flow from a given point to its final destination, teams can evaluate the relevance and value of data inputs and measure the impact of changes to data or alterations enacted upon it.\n\nHorizontal lineage: The flow of data across different systems, platforms, and applications is mapped using horizontal data lineage—showing how data moves, integrates, and transforms between its source and its target. Mapping horizontal lineage also includes the tools and processes involved in these data flows.\n\nVertical lineage: Alternately, mapping the verticality of data refers to its flow within a specific system, platform, or application. This information helps data teams understand how data in these locations is structured, stored, and accessed at different layers, including tables, columns, keys, records, fields, and files.\n\nEnd-to-end lineage: Teams may also map the horizontal and vertical aspects of data together, referred to as end-to-end lineage. This is done when stakeholders need a holistic view of data provenance, usage, and quality.\n\nTable-level lineage and column-level lineage: When a much more detailed form of data tracking is required, table-level lineage—mapped at the table level of databases or systems—provides teams with a detailed, macro view of data flow. Viewing the data at the table level can be useful when performing impact analysis, data integrations, migrations, or compliance and auditing.\n\nHowever, data quality management, debugging, or detailed impact analysis can require an even more granular view of data. In these cases, column-level lineage illuminates how data moves between individual columns or fields in a table, shows how that data is altered, and provides a view of its dependencies.\n\nTechnical data lineage: Zooming back out, teams map technical data lineage to broadly track the flow of data as it moves through technical processes and transformations. The details of data’s journey from data producers to its final destination(s) are key for maintaining data efficiency, integrity, and transparency throughout an organization.\n\nOperational data lineage: Additionally, mapping how data is used and accessed in day-to-day business operations provides another way to track how data moves throughout an organization (albeit a slightly broader one). By focusing on operational systems, teams can conduct business impact analysis, compliance, and reporting, and gauge operational efficiency.\n\nBusiness data lineage: Finally, data flowing between business processes can also be mapped. Business data lineage takes less concern with the specifics of what is happening to data. Often utilized by less technical stakeholders, this form of mapping tells the story of how data is impacting the business as a whole.\n\nData lineage best practices: Our 9 recommendations\n\nSettling on the right best practices for data lineage is a lot like settling on the best title for a book on data contracts; both are exercises in limitations and precision. (And another good option always pops to mind the moment you think you’re “done.”)\n\nThat said, we think the following nine best practices, as a whole, accomplish two things:\n\nThey can be used to support the foundational needs for tracking effective data lineage across most organizations.\n\nThey balance these foundational needs with some advanced enhancements.\n\n1. Clarify objectives, tying them to IT and business needs\n\nEstablishing clear objectives before embarking on any initiative, data-related or otherwise, is crucial. In this instance, clarity helps data leaders ensure that all tools, policies, and procedures that make up an organization’s data lineage practices will be efficient, sustainable, and aligned with ongoing business needs.\n\nIt’s worth considering how data contracts help you get the most out of this process, as the value of ongoing and tangible evidence of how data lineage practices positively impact an organization over time can’t be overstated.\n\n2. Leverage automation to maximize lineage fidelity and scalability\n\nPlan to automate data lineage practices as much as possible. Gaining access to accurate and consistent information is the point, after all. Automation, especially automated data discovery, can play a crucial role here, as it reduces the risks of errors inherent in manual processes.\n\nAt the same time, automation promotes scalability—ensuring that data lineage practices (especially those related to metadata capture and management) remain functionally efficient over time.\n\n3. Vet tool and system integrations\n\nFor most of us tasked with implementing data lineage practices, chances are good an established data environment will already be in operation. Audit existing data management tools based on established objectives, ensuring they’ll contribute to maximizing the utility of data lineage information. You can then determine if you’ll need to invest in a dedicated data lineage tool or if some combination of existing tools and systems will provide the needed functionality.\n\nWhile reviewing integration capabilities, you might request demonstrations and trials, assess levels of support from potential vendors, and conduct cost-benefit analyses as needed.\n\n4. Normalize (and standardize) comprehensive documentation\n\nMaintaining detailed and accurate records of data lineage should be the rule, not the exception. This documentation becomes crucial for understanding data flows and ensuring data quality throughout the lifecycle.\n\nDepending on the size of organizations, data teams may also need to be vigilant regarding whether this documentation remains standardized over time. This contributes to robust data governance, guiding consistent understanding and use across departments and teams—reducing confusion while fostering solid communication.\n\n5. Establish robust security and access control\n\nSecurity has always been critical for protecting sensitive lineage information. But it’s increasingly critical to position data security as the responsibility of everyone, not just those in IT. To this, implement secure communications and help your co-workers understand why, at their most basic level, encryption and secure APIs are being used.\n\nEstablish a consistent cadence and maintain detailed access logs to make sure systems and tools are patched and updated regularly. Implement monitoring tools to automatically detect unusual access patterns and ensure the right alerts get sent to the right people at the right times. And, as more of the organization leans in to keep data secure, robust access controls become increasingly important. Consider utilizing security principles like the principle of least privilege as you define and refine which roles and responsibilities get specific data access.\n\n6. Take time to make time for stakeholder buy-in\n\nAt this point, you’re more or less ready to approach stakeholders for their support. Make sure you do, and that a tacit buy-in is what you actually walk away with.\n\nDepending on your stakeholders, it may help to engage with them early and often. Make sure you clearly outline and identify the benefits the organization’s data lineage practices will have. Demonstrate how the lineage practices align with the business and set realistic expectations, the latter of which can often be aided through a strategic series of pilot programs.\n\n7. Visualize lineage and support ongoing training\n\nYou probably visualized parts of your lineage proposal to help sell it. Carry the visualization forward, representing data lineage in ways that make it easy for employees with different experience levels, skill sets, and backgrounds to understand and digest.\n\nAs able, promote training that ensures different users understand how to leverage the tool or tools used to map data lineage. (Note: To promote this training, consider pizza.)\n\n8. Monitor and measure mapping effectiveness\n\nSystematic measurement requires systematic monitoring of how effective data lineage practices are over time. In turn, effectively doing both helps data teams ensure that supporting systems are robust, responsive, and stay aligned with organization governance and management objectives.\n\nIdeally, this monitoring and measurement isn’t limited to lineage alone but functions as part of broader data management efforts.\n\n9. Review and update lineage practices regularly\n\nThe tail of the best-practices snake here consists of regular audits and reviews of the data lineage process as it unravels.\n\nThis is vital, as it allows data teams to adjust the granularity of data lineage mapping, balancing utility across users and uses while optimizing for evolving stakeholder needs.\n\nA data catalog can also be beneficial here. When embedded with data lineage information, these catalogs make it easier for users to get at and understand the data they need, enhancing overall data management.\n\nRemember that in data lineage, “well-begun” is half-done\n\nThe potential impact of a map directly correlates to the quality of information used to create it.\n\nBest practices, in addition to a clear understanding of the concept, certainly make data lineage practices more efficient and effective. But shifting the emphasis and expectation of data quality further left can make them exceptional.\n\nBe among the first to find out the role data contracts can (and increasingly do) play in the lineage of data by signing up for our product waitlist at Gable.ai.\n\n‍",
      "# [Data Governance: What Is It + Best Practices](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-governance)\nRegarding data, knowing how, who, and what are the most critical questions to govern it efficiently and responsibly. Data governance gives organizations the strategy to manage their information.\n\nIn this article, we’ll define data governance. Then, we’ll dive into why it’s essential, critical pillars of governance, its benefits, and its challenges. By the end, you’ll learn about one of the most innovative ways to govern your data assets: combining the common reactive approach with a more efficient, preventative strategy.\n\nWhat is data governance?\n\nData governance sets clear rules for handling and stewarding customer information throughout its lifecycle. It ensures data is accurate, used correctly, and kept safe.\n\nOne great way to imagine a data governance program is by picturing the following scenario:\n\nSuppose you buy an RV from an estate sale. It works great and looks terrific, but the seller says you get the whole package. Everything inside from the previous owners is yours. There might be something valuable in there, but you won’t know until you look around and sift through the items (and clutter) in the vehicle.\n\nThese objects, like pieces of data, have to be organized into a few categories:\n\nDetection: You discover and identify what’s in the RV. There might be old vinyl records in a cubby, family photographs in the closet, or valuable jewelry left behind. Some things might be useful, others worthless, while different pieces might have significance in the future (for example, maybe you don’t need the power drill you found in an old toolbox, but you might need it when you want to make minor improvements in the future).\n\nClassification: Now, it’s time to classify each item and formalize what you’ve found. Label the value and use of each item. Organize everything so you can easily access it when it’s time to move them to the right place.\n\nProcess: Decide the policy you’ll base decisions on, like how you plan on using the items. What determines a good object or not? Where should it go? Create a strategy to follow.\n\nParameters: Now that you have the process on paper, you can follow specific guidelines to determine what to do with each piece—a set of clear rules.\n\nCommunication: Through documentation with metadata management, you can add the vital information you need to retrieve and understand it. In the context of the RV, it might look like labels, a notebook explaining everything, or another system entirely. This data catalog also articulates to others what they should do with the items—there’s clear data lineage.\n\nLike the RV example, those governing data start with a central location. From there, they must decide what to do with the data, and who it should go to.\n\nFor example, different teams within an organization require different data sets, instructions on how to use them, and permissions for data access. Marketing teams, accounts receivable, customer service teams, and tech/product support would look different in the data governance context—especially as it may include social security numbers and sensitive data.\n\nThe data team can enact the process for governance that would create a way to protect everyone, provide accurate information at the right time, and provide clear guidelines on how to use it.\n\nWhy is it important?\n\nGood data governance has become essential now more than ever. Thanks to innovative technology (like artificial intelligence and machine learning) and customers living more of their lives online, there is a significant amount of information to collect, analyze, and use for decision-making and improving customer experiences.\n\nCustomers also expect you to use data efficiently, with McKinsey & Company reporting that 71% of consumers want personalized interactions and 76% get frustrated when companies fall short of it.\n\nThe importance of data governance initiatives is two-fold:\n\n1. Accurate, responsible, and efficient data for companies\n\nWith an effective data governance strategy, organizations can ensure high-quality data, use it responsibly, and maximize output.\n\nCompanies should ensure they have the right compliance, procedures, and tools to get the most out of data and use it to improve the customer experience.\n\nOne significant challenge is dealing with reactive strategies. While a quick response is ideal when something goes wrong with your data collection and processing, it’s not enough to ensure quality data governance. Companies need a preventative solution.\n\nGable's innovative technology helps organizations improve data quality at scale by fostering communication between data producers and consumers via data contracts. These contracts eliminate the human error component and stop mistakes before they happen.\n\n2. Ensuring customer trust in today’s climate\n\nThe data industry knows the challenges it’s faced with privacy, transparency, and consumer trust—in short, the world is paying attention to how companies handle data.\n\nCompanies should be able to uphold regulations like GDPR and perform above standards to remove themselves from avoidable pitfalls. They can position themselves as one of the industry's safest, most trustworthy businesses.\n\nSince 2019, data privacy search inquiries have doubled, signaling the need for more responsible data management. It’s no longer enough to handle data ethically, but consumers want full transparency and clarity on what’s collected and how it’s used.\n\nSource: Google Trends | Search inquiries for data privacy have doubled in only a few years.\n\nEffective data governance addresses these concerns. Companies can use the tools necessary to handle big data responsibly and enable access to the right individuals. Organizations can also provide clear and transparent policies to customers, communicating data practices and what to expect.\n\nAs mentioned, customers want personalized experiences. This starts with quality data. And if we can combine that with the qualifications expected from us when it comes to building trust—like data protection and transparency—then we can create a productive data strategy.\n\nWhen we fail to govern data\n\nWhen we can no longer trust data, it becomes unreliable. We no longer have a picture of consumers, the world, and where the market is heading. Management is stuck making business decisions no longer based on information but on best guesses.\n\nBut that doesn’t have to be the case. By following foundational principles, we can avoid situations that compromise our data.\n\nData governance in the cloud era\n\nIn recent years, cloud technology has changed the data governance landscape. Depending on the infrastructure you use, data is available anywhere and everywhere. This has brought more concerns about safety, security, and management protocols.\n\nThe changes have led to more federated data governance. Unlike previous systems that centralized data, federated governance addresses the distributed nature of data in the cloud. It enables companies to manage and govern across different teams and platforms, providing flexibility, scalability, and efficiency regarding governance policies.\n\nAnother issue to consider is the involvement of non-technical teams in data governance. Non-technical staff will inevitably influence how data is managed as it becomes more accessible. Without the right system, code vulnerabilities can spark major concern.\n\nThat’s why a user-friendly no-code solution that allows users to manage data can help safeguard and empower non-technical teams to govern effectively. Clear guidelines that help govern data will also accelerate your governance strategy for better and safer results.\n\nThese fast-paced changes in modern cloud data governance require agile and adaptive systems. Unlike traditional governance, which might move slowly, contemporary governance must work quickly to adapt to changing tech and consumer expectations. Companies can adopt automated governance tools, implement continuous monitoring, and have a tighter feedback loop to adjust swiftly and respond to evolving requirements.\n\nThe four pillars of the data governance framework\n\nData governance comprises a few foundational principles, often summarized in four pillars. As a data governance team works towards efficient and secure information, they have the job of ensuring that data is organized and ready for an organization to grow and achieve its top-level priorities.\n\n1. Upholding standards and regulations\n\nTeams must ensure that all practices, regulatory requirements, and compliances are maintained and upheld.\n\nFor example, the GDPR, or the General Data Protection Regulation, is one of the strictest laws globally for data security and privacy. The EU law ensures that consumers are protected and that there is transparency on what data is being collected and what it’s being used for.\n\nWhen companies become GDPR compliant, they meet EU standards and build one of the strongest, safest foundations for their data governance journey.\n\nGDPR and other relevant compliances and regulations are essential to ensuring companies meet legal standards. Afterward, they can continue to create an above-and-beyond approach to create a safer and more transparent system for consumers. As trends and privacy expectations evolve, businesses can lead the way.\n\n2. Data quality\n\nTeams are then expected to supervise data and ensure it is authentic and reliable. Data is only as good as its quality, and companies need it to make the right decisions. Quality can be measured by preciseness, thoroughness, authenticity, timeliness, and consistency.\n\nPreciseness: Is the data correct? Can it be validated and trusted?\n\nThoroughness: Is the data complete, and does it make sense as it is? Can it be used? Is there missing information that prevents the data from telling a complete story? Is the data organized?\n\nAuthenticity: Does each piece of information accurately represent the subject or action?\n\nTimeliness: Is this data relevant to understanding present situations? Does older information add context, or is it misleading? Using this data, can we predict growing trends?\n\nConsistency: Are we gathering enough data through regular intervals, touchpoints, and actions? Are all tools in sync and integrated? Is manual labor getting in the way of collection, metrics, and analytics?\n\n3. Transparency and privacy\n\nData should be ethically managed—every involved party should know what’s collected, as well as how and what it’s used for. Managers should also make sure that these guidelines and promises are upheld.\n\n4. Data management\n\nManagement refers to the overall components of governance—the “governing” portion. While stewardship identifies who is accountable and shapes the program, data management refers to all the moving pieces of making governing possible—like how efficient, secure, and cost-effective the process is. Additionally, it includes what tools are being used and how the data is stored.\n\nData governance key roles\n\nWhile there are many roles and responsibilities within data governance (like strategic level oversight), there are a few hands-on positions.\n\nSteward: The data steward cares for the data to ensure it’s accurate and up to policy standards.\n\nManager: The data manager helps put the strategic plan into action.\n\nUser: Data users involve the team and how they perform daily tasks, interact with the data, and study sets.\n\nWhat are the challenges of maintaining data governance?\n\nEach pillar of data governance faces obstacles.\n\nIs it accurate and timely? Data teams must optimize and review how they collect and analyze data consistently. Additionally, they need parameters to evaluate expired data. If the data is no longer accurate, the team loses trust in the information, leadership makes the wrong decisions, and the organization builds data debt.\n\nIs it going to the right people, and are they using the data as they should? Data teams must decide who has access to the data, how much of it, and what they can use it for. If there are inconsistencies in the policy or if circumstances change and leadership does not follow up, companies risk irresponsible governance and vulnerabilities.\n\nWhat happens when there is an inefficiency? How is it handled? If data tools are not working right, if data isn’t organized, or if something is throwing a wrench into collection and analysis, teams need to quickly identify and solve the issue.\n\nIs the organization communicating its data policy? Teams must ensure that what data they collect and how they use it is communicated to customers, employees, and essential stakeholders. There should be transparency as data policies evolve.\n\n5 best practices to consider when managing data governance\n\n1. Choose the right team\n\nGovernance is about the right people. You need team members who are passionate about quality data and have the never-ending desire to ensure the best and most accurate information possible. Additionally, that information serves the organization and its initiatives.\n\n2. Understand it’s a process\n\nData governance is a lot like gardening. You don’t plant seedlings and then revisit them in a few months. Most of them would die. Instead, you visit, water, and care for them often. When you spot weeds, you pull them out. Data governance is a continuous process that should be treated with care and dedication.\n\n3. Set high standards and communicate expectations\n\nEnsure your team is consistently communicating. They should question how enterprise data is collected, presented, and analyzed. Team members should be able to correct issues quickly and prevent the same ones in the future.\n\n4. Know the vision\n\nThe strategy should be crystal clear. If data teams know what the business goals are, they can manage data so that it’s organized and efficient to use for the needs of the organization. If team members aren’t sure what the vision is, it creates confusion, messy data, and more difficulty in making strategic decisions.\n\n5. Invest in the right technology and data governance tools\n\nIn the data world, inefficient technology and human error can wreak havoc. That’s why choosing the right platforms and tools to help govern your data through contracts, automation, and communication is critical for creating a smooth process, reducing issues, and providing the best, most relevant information possible.\n\nGable: From reactive to preventative solutions\n\nReactive problem-solving is important. We need to be able to identify an issue and fix it to preserve data integrity and security. But it shouldn’t be the only solution.\n\nMany reactive situations can be avoided from the start.\n\nGable’s proprietary technology provides data teams with data contracts to eliminate human error and prevent issues. Instead of waiting to identify a problem once it’s already happening (and causing damage), you can stop it from happening altogether.\n\nGable’s data contracts enable you to establish data owners, set requirements for the data, and codify these nuances as version-controlled code.\n\nWe know reactive data monitoring isn’t enough. Gable ensures that alerts trigger from notifications within the CI/CD workflow. Our bot provides context to developers where they are and tags data consumers after detecting breaking changes.\n\nBy bridging the communication gap between data producers and consumers, our platform creates a more accurate, efficient solution for data.",
      "# [Data Consumers: How to Make a Meal Of Your Data](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-consumers)\nData consumers don’t bite. Honest.\n\nBut they do play increasingly vital roles in modern businesses. And their ability to deliver on behalf of the organization does depend on you keeping them well-fed—with data, that is.\n\n(Cue record-scratch.)\n\n‍\n\nData consumers are individuals, systems, and applications that access and use data to perform specific tasks or make informed decisions. As data continues to proliferate into more aspects of daily life, this definition becomes increasingly important.\n\nWhile most of us consume data by default, technical data consumers—those working in data analytics, data science, business intelligence, and the like—rely as much on the quality of data as they do its availability. This necessitates treating data as a product, with the entire organization working together to ensure the highest standards of quality are maintained over the course of the data lifecycle.\n\nThis is why it’s imperative for those working in tech-adjacent roles (e.g., managers, executives, decision-makers, and stakeholders) to understand how they can optimize for data consumers within their own organizations. But we’ll circle back to that.\n\nFirst, let’s lay a foundation by making sure we clarify what separates data producers from data consumers (and what doesn’t) in addition to covering who commonly acts as a data consumer in modern businesses.\n\nData producers vs. data consumers: As simple as it seems?\n\nIt does seem obvious. Data producers produce and/or provide data, while data consumers access and use that data. However, there are nuances to this relationship that are worth understanding. Here are some key factors, common within business environments, that can challenge the seemingly clear distinction between data production and consumption.\n\nOverlapping functions\n\nWhile often considered separately, a single entity can function as both a data producer and consumer. For example, sales teams often produce data about customer interactions, which counts as a producer role. However, it’s common for these same teams to handle the analysis of this data in order to refine their sales strategies. More generally, feedback loops within a data-savvy organization have this effect as well.\n\nData transformation\n\nTransformation of data is an instrumental part of data management. In practice, data producers may act as sources of raw data. This data then undergoes a transformation process as it’s ingested into the organization for use downstream. This can blur the line between producers and consumers in practice, as the transformation process necessitates data being consumed from one source before being delivered for use to another.\n\nVariability of data production\n\nData is produced both actively and passively. An example of active production could be the filling out of a basic web form, a deliberate act of data entry, or data generation. This could be related to customer data or personal data when individuals provide information about themselves.\n\nAn example of passive data production is how user interactions are typically logged on a social media platform or a website. These data sources often involve data collection methods that track user behavior. Whether or not data is actively or passively produced can challenge the notion of whether it’s being produced or consumed by a given data system.\n\nData stewardship and ownership\n\nGranted, data producers generate data. However, they may not have stewardship or ownership over the data produced. At the same time, data stewards who may not produce or consume data directly often play a crucial tertiary role in ensuring data quality, privacy, and security.\n\nTiming and evolution\n\nProducers and consumers of data often interact with data at different times. It’s common for data produced in real-time to be consumed in batches, or vice versa. This asynchronicity can also cloud a binary notion of who’s producing and consuming data over time.\n\nAnd, over time, the needs of data evolve as business models evolve. Meaning systems traditionally viewed as data consumers, like home appliances, can become data producers (i.e., the Internet of Things).\n\nThe basic definitions of data producers and consumers are simple enough. But as business leaders, it’s advantageous to appreciate how fluid these definitions can be in practice.\n\nWho (and what) are data consumers?\n\nWith this valuable context in mind, let’s now touch on who—and what—typically functions as a data consumer within an organization. This of course includes individuals and teams, but consumers can also be systems and applications or external entities.\n\nIndividuals and teams\n\nBusiness analysts and data scientists: Those who analyze data to extract insights, identify trends, and recommend business improvements certainly count as data consumers, as do the experts using advanced statistics, machine learning, and sheer compute to cull insights and predictions from data.\n\nSales and marketing teams: The aforementioned sales teams consume data to track sales performance, identify leads, and forecast sales trends. At the same time, marketing teams leverage data to better understand customer behavior, segment markets, measure campaign effectiveness, and, like their counterparts in sales, attempt to forecast trends.\n\nFinance, accounting, and operations teams: Key players on these teams consume data for budgeting, forecasting, financial reporting, and risk assessment analysis.\n\nOperations and supply chain teams: These teams consume data to optimize inventory and streamline operations.\n\nHuman resources (HR): Those working in human resources increasingly consume data related to recruitment trends (i.e., supply and demand), workforce analytics, and employee performance.\n\nCustomer support and service teams: High-performing contact centers rely on a constant stream of data to track service requests, evaluate customer feedback, and improve customer satisfaction.\n\nProduct managers: These roles require all available data to monitor product performance, user engagement, and identify areas of improvement.\n\nDecision makers and stakeholders: In data-driven organizations, senior leaders and managers rely on aggregated data and insights to make more productive, strategic decisions.\n\nSystems and applications\n\nBusiness intelligence tools: BI tools like Tableau, QlikView, and Power BI consume data in order to create visual representations and dashboards that analysts (also data consumers, see above) use in their work.\n\nCustomer relationship management systems: Alternatively, popular CRMs (think Salesforce and Hubspot) also consume data. Some do produce data visualizations as well, but this functionality is secondary to their primary goal of helping manage customer data and interactions.\n\nEnterprise resource planning systems: ERPs are comprehensive software solutions built to consume massive quantities of data in order to integrate various business processes and functions into a single system, one that aids in data management, process automation, reporting, analytics, and more.\n\nAutomated reporting systems: Complexity is not a prerequisite for being a data consumer, as straightforward reporting systems like NinjaOne and Alteryx consume data only as needed to aid in data preparation and report generation.\n\nData warehouses and data lakes: Typically thought of as data sources, centralized data repositories engineered to store structured and unstructured data must, by design, consume data in order to serve their purpose.\n\nMachine learning models: The algorithms driving artificial intelligence (AI) consume troves of data in order to make business-related predictions or automate decision-making processes.\n\nApplication programming interfaces: And, while APIs do not technically consume data to serve their purpose, they do get an honorable mention here since they create the pathways different systems and applications use to communicate, consume, and share data together.\n\nExternal entities\n\nPartners and affiliates: Business partners like suppliers, vendors, marketing agencies, and consulting firms often need to consume organizational data to measure joint campaign performance or align strategies.\n\nRegulatory bodies: In highly regulated industries like finance and healthcare, organizations may need to share data with regulatory authorities to ensure business operations and data management are in compliance.\n\nYour valued customers: Last but not least, digitally sophisticated customers are voracious when it comes to data consumption in the world of B2C. And, in B2B scenarios, customers are also increasingly consuming data reports and analytics as they grow both more available and accessible to less technical audiences.\n\n15 best practices to optimize your org for data consumers\n\nIn business, sadly, not all individuals get to enjoy the luxury of thinking about data management and information technology all day, every day. For those who cannot, all the information we’ve shared at this point was provided to foster an understanding and appreciation for the nuanced and varied roles consumers play in the data lifecycle.\n\nBut, often, these are the same people who have the influence and pull needed to empower a truly data-driven organization. For this reason, the following list of 15 succinct best practices is curated for those stakeholders and decision-makers who want to help set the table, so to speak.\n\nLet’s dig in:\n\n1. Engage with your data consumers\n\nOne of the best things a stakeholder can do is simple: Regularly communicate with data users in the organization. Take the time to understand the distinct requirements and challenges they face in their role.\n\nPro tip: Make constant communication easy by scheduling regular, brief check-ins with those you consider to be key data users. Quick, consistent 15-minute meetings are far more useful than longer meetings set up and attended “once in a while.”\n\n2. Treat your data as a product\n\nRestaurants live and die based on the quality of the ingredients they source. The needs and importance of your data consumers are just one of many reasons to make sure your data is of the highest possible quality, ensuring it is reliable, timely, and consistent.\n\nPro tip: The volume of data flow through even a relatively small organization is often more than can be managed manually. Work with your data leaders to implement automated data quality checks. Also, make sure that any alerts these systems use when they detect anomalies are set up to go to the right people, at the right time.\n\n3. Adopt a strong data governance framework\n\n“Data governance” can sound intense. But at its heart, governance is really just a formalized approach to defining and maintaining clear roles for data ownership and stewardship.\n\nPro tip: Robust governance is a must in today’s data-driven business world. Do your part by making sure the team or data stewards in charge are given the support and bandwidth required to succeed in their role (especially if one of those stewards will be you).\n\n4. Prioritize data security and compliance\n\nIt’s a lot harder to deal with a burglar when they’re already inside your house. Ensure that encryption, access controls, and regular audits are all in place to protect data on behalf of your consumers. It’s important to ensure everyone is up to date with regularly updated data privacy regulations specific to your organization and business model.\n\nPro tip: In partnership with your data leaders, look to leverage cloud-based solutions that include built-in security features. Doing so reduces the burdens of managing security completely in-house.\n\n5. Provide accessible data tools\n\nChampion tools and platforms for your data consumers that have earned a reputation for being highly intuitive to use. Powerful solutions that are also user-friendly encourage wide adoption, enhanced productivity, reduced training costs, and increased data accuracy.\n\nPro tip: Don’t sleep on the power of data visualization in business. BI tools in particular tend to offer dashboard capabilities that allow for quick insights without the deep dives.\n\n6. Educate and train staff\n\nData literacy should no longer be relegated to specific departments. It’s not a chore—it’s a responsibility. The health and quality of data is determined by all of its consumers, both direct and indirect. Promote this mission-critical knowledge through regular training sessions and workshops, in addition to up-to-date, accessible resources.\n\nPro tip: On-demand online training modules can drastically simplify an ongoing data literacy initiative. They serve as a means to centralize information and resources, in addition to minimizing the need for lengthy (read: costly) training sessions.\n\n7. Design for scalability and adaptability\n\nHelp ensure data systems in your organization are built to scale with the needs of your business and your data consumers.\n\nPro tip: Explore how cloud solutions can also support your ability to scale with respect to data. As these solutions grow more ubiquitous, it becomes easier to find one that can grow in sync with your business, without the need for frequent upgrades.\n\n8. Encourage cross-functional collaboration\n\nOne data-related area that firmly falls within the onus of leadership is whether or not collaborative environments are actively fostered within the organization. Optimizing for data consumption requires departments proactively working to share data and insights, and minimize data silos.\n\nPro tip: Think of inter-office communication platforms like Slack or Teams as collaboration platforms. Encourage quick, specific chats as a way of keeping your data consumers out of lengthy meetings.\n\n9. Streamline data collection processes\n\nTo ensure efficiency and reduce redundancy, normalize the ongoing automation and optimization of data collection.\n\nPro tip: Automating everything isn’t the goal. Look at where a little bit of automation will have the biggest impact. Sometimes, something as simple as utilizing APIs to pull data without manual intervention can net significant benefits.\n\n10. Iterate based on feedback\n\nThere should be no set-it-and-forget-it with organizational data management. Data processes need to be continuously refined based on the feedback you get from data consumers. More than just understanding their needs, you can play a vital role in keeping those needs met.\n\nPro tip: Business is complicated, but soliciting valuable feedback doesn’t have to be. Look to use simple feedback tools or surveys. Think about how you can reduce barriers so feedback relating to data usage is easy to give and receive.\n\n11. Stay in the know regarding data innovations\n\nLike data literacy, many people within an organization should be investing time to review emerging data-related trends through the lens of their role, experience, and skill sets. The sparks that lead to early adoption can come from anywhere. And the competitive advantages of early adoption can often prove invaluable.\n\nPro tip: Subscribe to a few industry newsletters and data-related Substacks. Just as regularly reading the trades is a must in Hollywood, use a few moments of your morning to review who’s doing what with data in your industry.\n\n12. Clarify data use cases\n\nUse cases are an excellent way to make sure specific scenarios or objectives your data consumers face align with the business’s overall goals.\n\nPro tip: It never hurts to base consumer use cases on clear business objectives. Keeping a focus on goals enables you to help streamline data processes and reduce unnecessary work.\n\n13. Leverage external data resources\n\nConsider formal partnerships or collaborations with external data sources that can enhance and complement internal data. Market trends, demographic information, and industry benchmarks can often enrich internal sales data. Analyzing data from external sources can lead to new market opportunities, potential risks, and emerging trends. And external data can be used to benchmark organizational performance against industry standards, or the competition.\n\nPro tip: Outsourcing some data needs can save time and improve data quality. But always endeavor to partner with the most reputable and trustworthy data providers.\n\n14. Document your data processes\n\nDocumentation is a critical part of maintaining high data quality. Your organization should maintain an accessible repository of all data guidelines, standards, and workflows, ensuring consistency and clarity in data practices.\n\nPro tip: To keep documentation from becoming daunting, leverage documentation tools with simple yet robust templates. Over time, these templates reduce the effort needed to update and maintain your documentation.\n\n15. Conduct regular data audits\n\nData access, usage, and quality all need to be reviewed periodically. By making data audits consistent, you’ll help identify areas of improvement while ensuring compliance.\n\nPro tip: Don’t expect your peers to party when audit time rolls around. But do work to schedule audits during less busy periods in the business. This consideration, along with keeping up a regular cadence with the audits themselves, can prevent unexpected issues and reduce stress.\n\nOrganizations are brimming with data-hungry professionals—make sure the data you source is always up to code\n\n‍\n\nWe’re still a bit in the Wild West when it comes to managing data at scale, especially with the recent rise of large language models. However, there are valuable third parties that can lend a hand through the use of data contracts. Gable.ai is transforming how data contracts work, and the data consumers in your organization deserve to benefit from what we’re cooking up in our own kitchen.",

      "# [How to Protect the Data Pipeline Process with Data Contracts](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-pipeline-process)\nThe most efficient systems may be extremely valuable and essential, but everything goes out the window when there's a vulnerability.\n\n‍\n\nTake, for instance, air travel. It’s the most efficient way to get you from Point A to Point B.\n\n‍\n\nThe passengers of Alaska Airlines would’ve agreed too, when suddenly, on January 5th, 2024, a piece of the aircraft snapped off with a bang.\n\n‍\n\nThankfully, they made it back safely, and the aircrew acted heroically to ensure everyone was safe. But it brings up an important issue.\n\n‍\n\nLike an aircraft, your data pipeline process should be accurate and protected at all times. That’s why ensuring your pipeline is safeguarded from future vulnerabilities, breakages, and interruptions is critical.\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\nFirst, we’ll define a data pipeline. Then, we’ll go over some types you can expect, steps, and benefits for data pipelines.\n\n‍\n\nFinally, we’ll learn how data contracts can help protect your data pipeline process for better accuracy and efficiency.\n\nWhat is a data pipeline?\n\nA data pipeline is how a company defines and executes how raw data moves between systems, gets verified, stored, and maintained.\n\nThe data pipeline process clarifies how we incorporate our data strategy.\n\nWhen the data is processed, it goes to the data sink for use case applications, a data warehouse for analytics, or the data lake for continued data science and machine learning.\n\nWhat types of data pipelines are there?\n\nData pipeline strategies vary based on your industry and needs. But the pipeline can be split into two types.\n\n1. Batch processing pipeline\n\nThe batch method is one of the more traditional options companies choose for enterprise data. It’s when a company processes data through fixed, predefined parameters. Your team can process larger quantities of data at a time.\n\nSince such a big data load can cause latency issues, the information is often processed during odd hours with less user activity, such as at 3 a.m.\n\nBatch processing is effective for processing lots of data that aren’t as time-sensitive. It can include historical data or metadata that could be useful in the future.\n\nBatch pipelines, however, are challenging to maintain, with systems often having to process data even if it hasn’t changed (which is a lot of work for humans and computers). Since you load volumes of data, your system will also have a knowledge gap and contain outdated information.\n\n2. Real-time or streaming processing pipeline\n\nStreaming processing pipelines are a great way to manage your data in the fast-paced world of computers and the internet.\n\nA streaming pipeline is when companies process data as it arrives, giving them low latency and current insights. Data engineers and teams can work with new data and updated datasets through automation.\n\nUnlike batch data, stream processing is constantly changing. It influences your dashboards with metrics, data analytics, and decision-making information.\n\nWhile this pipeline is very effective, it can be risky if you don’t have the right data strategy in place. You want to ensure you have the right tools and management to verify data quality and prevent hiccups as data is gathered and processed.\n\nPipelines can also include focused categories, depending on your type of business and where your data flow is. Some examples include:\n\nCloud data process: The focus on cloud-based services and how data lives, processes, and is integrated within the cloud.\n\nMachine learning process: How data is processed for machine learning (the end-to-end deployment of learning models and data preparation).\n\nData governance process: How data is governed and protected for quality, security, and compliance.\n\nWhat is ELT and ETL?\n\nAs you improve your data pipeline process, you may come across the terms ELT and ETL. They sound the same, and for the most part they are.\n\nBoth of these models focus on the order of steps for pipelines.\n\nThe initials stand for the same but place emphasis on the order:\n\nE = Extract\n\nL = Load\n\nT = Transform\n\nThey cover how data is collected, changed, and stored. These days, different pipelines can have multiple stages where ELT and ETL are involved. Often, the methods are talked about interchangeably and already function within your pipeline.\n\nELT (extract, load, and transform) might be good for a SaaS with strict rules and a critical schema to follow.\n\nOn the other hand, ETL (extract, transform, load) might be a good option to store information in your data warehouse or lake.\n\nWhat is the difference between an ETL/ELT and data pipeline?\n\nETL and ELT fall under the umbrella of your data pipeline and how you process information. While two different things, the ETL and ELT refer to your tactical steps while the pipeline encompasses the process.\n\nWhat are the benefits of a data pipeline process?\n\nData pipelines create a better way to manage your data and save you time. Below are the top advantages of a healthy process:\n\n1. Get better data quality\n\nWhen you implement a data pipeline process, you get cleaner results. The pipeline can refine the information, find and correct redundancies, and provide a usable dataset to work with.\n\n2. Make it a more efficient process\n\nData pipelines, thanks to data contracts, make it possible to automate the process. This saves thousands of hours of data engineering work. Instead, your team can use the saved time to find ways to improve your data approach or analyze the information.\n\n3. Implement a holistic approach to data\n\nThrough automation and the ability to bring your data together, your pipeline can integrate your data sources, transform data, and create a holistic product. It checks values from different sources and finds consistency errors. Additionally, it flags and corrects other common errors.\n\nWhat are the steps of the data pipeline process?\n\nETL and ELT are part of the data pipeline infrastructure. The concepts are also commonly summarized into the following:\n\n1. Data ingestion\n\nThis is when data is extracted from sources and brought to a central location for company access and analyses.\n\nThe data is often found from a source like a CRM (Salesforce, Hubspot, or Zoho). It can also come from other sources that collect data.\n\n2. Data transformation\n\nData is converted and structured to fit your system as a usable format.\n\nTransformation can take many forms. It may be the way you need data recognized, filtered, or segmented. Company pipelines may include data contracts to automatically sort and manipulate the data.\n\n‍3. Data storage\n\nFinally, your data is stored so that the company can access it and use it for business operations.\n\nIt usually arrives at a data warehouse or data lake. From there, your data team can analyze the information or use it.\n\nWhat are the benefits of Apache Kafka?\n\nApache Kafka is a popular solution for data pipeline processing. It is an open-source platform that helps manage and transform your real-time data—which is great for streaming pipelines.\n\nThere are plenty of benefits to using Apache Kafka.\n\nIt’s open-sourced, which means you can build your own solutions or partner with a third party to create a custom fit for your company.\n\nIt’s fast and scalable, so you can process data immediately across many servers.\n\nIt’s durable with Apache Kafka’s ability to provide intra-cluster replication.\n\nIt has high performance, even when dealing with large amounts of data.\n\nHow do data contracts support pipelines?\n\nData is only as good as its accuracy. The minute it’s compromised, you can’t trust it. Your business decisions, customer behavior analytics, and planning are now done in the dark.\n\nThankfully, we now have the technology to prevent data pipeline issues before they happen.\n\nYou no longer have to worry about a problem after that fact, you can rely on data contracts to execute smooth processes and eliminate avoidable mistakes.\n\nData contracts define the structure, format, and criteria for data as it is extracted, transformed, and stored. It eliminates human error and can find issues before they become a problem.\n\nData contracts automate your pipeline for a smoother, more accurate data process and workflow.\n\nData contracts for a better pipeline process\n\nWhen you think of a literal pipeline that moves water, it’s a powerful force. It’s efficient, it moves fast, and it can push the resource to its destination.\n\nWhere pipelines might depend on water pressure, gravity, and energy to function properly, your data pipeline needs its power source too.\n\nData contracts move, transform, and store your information efficiently through automatic processes. Choosing the right solution provides the power source to make it possible.\n\nGable automatically generates contract templates, manages contract versioning, and enforces contracts using a variety of alerting thresholds.\n\nYou can collaborate with data engineers, data scientists, and software engineers to create and modify contracts over time.\n\nWith Gable, you can prevent breaking changes programmatically and alert consumers when contract updates will impact them. You can manage contract versions and evolution simply and easily.\n\nIt’s perfect for your data pipeline process, especially if you want to take control of your data management and use your information to its full potential—so you can grow your company with secure, reliable, and efficient data.",
      "# [3 Data Contract Types and Examples](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-contract-example)\nIn the wake of the tsunami of big data, it would seem we’re entering the era of the data contract.\n\nData contracts are formal agreements similar in spirit to service-level agreements (SLAs). They are drafted and enforced to ensure that the data products an organization relies on are of high quality, meeting the needs of both data producers and data consumers. This makes data contracts an increasingly essential aspect of modern data management.\n\n‍\n\nThis is why it’s important for data professionals to understand more than just the theory behind data contracts.\n\nThe right data contract examples provide context on the difference they make in the real world. This enables more data leaders to advocate for their use.\n\nSchema, semantics, and metadata: 3 key responsibilities of the data contract\n\n“The power of data contracts is that they're designed to unite teams and disciplines across an entire company, while also integrating seamlessly into the individual tools and workflows at all stages of the data lifecycle.” — Data Contracts: Building Production Grade Pipelines at Scale (O’Reilly, 2024)\n\nThe heart of every data contract lies in three core responsibilities: schema, semantics, and metadata.\n\nTogether, these components ensure that data assets are properly structured, business logic is consistently applied, and metadata maintains data quality and traceability throughout the entire data lifecycle.\n\n1. Schema\n\nData contracts enforce schema rules that define data types, ensuring consistency and preventing invalid data from entering the system. By using data representation standards like JSON Schema or YAML, data teams can codify the required structure, types, and constraints of a given dataset to ensure data consistency and quality.\n\nFor example, imagine a data contract drafted to support a subscription-based fitness service called CryptoCrunch. Let’s say this platform connects fitness tracking devices to user accounts, capturing data like workout performance, energy expenditure, and biometric data.\n\n(For fun, let’s also imagine CryptoCrunch’s user base creates biometric energy by doing intense core-related exercises to offset the fossil fuel energy required for Bitcoin mining. Because why not?)\n\nIn this (objectively awesome) example, a JSON Schema could define a contract for a CryptoCrunch database table containing user information, ensuring that every record has a valid email address and a non-empty customer ID. Data contracts can enforce these rules in near real-time during data ingestion. Alternatively, they can enforce data quality rules as part of CI/CD workflows to catch schema violations early in the data pipeline.\n\nNote: YAML is often used alongside JSON Schema because it provides a more human-readable format, making it easier for teams to define and review schema specifications.\n\n2. Semantics\n\nIn addition to enforcing schema, data contracts define clear rules for data producers, ensuring that the data they generate meets the expected standards before moving downstream. This includes the business logic that defines how data consumers and other stakeholders should interpret and use data in the specific context of the organization.\n\nFor example, in the CryptoCrunch platform, a data contract might define a \"workout session\" as a set of core-related exercises that generates a certain amount of biometric energy. The business logic could specify that a valid workout session must last at least 30 minutes and generate a minimum amount of energy to qualify for Bitcoin mining offsets.\n\nSemantic rules like these are critical for maintaining consistency, especially when data is transformed or shared across teams, such as customer service, analytics, and data engineering. If CryptoCrunch expands its service to include partnerships with other energy-efficient platforms, these contracts would ensure that everyone downstream is using data that reflects these specific business rules.\n\nBy embedding this business logic directly into the data contract, the platform ensures that teams responsible for workout performance analytics or energy expenditure tracking always work with data that aligns with organizational expectations. This reduces the risk of errors or inconsistencies and ensures that the data correctly reflects user activities and energy credits.\n\n3. Metadata\n\nThe third key responsibility of data contracts involves managing metadata, which is essential for maintaining consistency and traceability across datasets. Metadata typically includes details such as when the data was created, how it has been processed or transformed since its creation, and who owns or is responsible for it.\n\nThis metadata management is a crucial part of data governance, with data contracts ensuring that data quality, consistency, and ownership are enforced across the organization. By codifying these governance rules into contracts, organizations can ensure that data adheres to defined quality standards before those organizations progress through a data pipeline or the data lifecycle.\n\nFor example, CryptoCrunch metadata might track important details such as when a user's workout data was generated, how much energy was expended during the session, and whether that energy was successfully converted into Bitcoin mining offsets. Additionally, the metadata would indicate who “owns” the data—whether it’s linked to an individual user’s account or aggregated for system-wide energy consumption reports.\n\nBy managing this metadata, the CryptoCrunch data contract would ensure that each user’s workout data adheres to the platform’s quality standards before being processed to generate energy credits or used in performance analytics. This process ensures that any issues are addressed before the data moves further down the CryptoCrunch pipeline, maintaining both data integrity and governance.\n\nData contract examples: Enforcing quality and consistency\n\n“It’s not a matter of if a data issue will arise, but rather a matter of when, and increased scope leads to an increased probability of issues being highlighted.”​ — Data Contracts: Building Production Grade Pipelines at Scale (O’Reilly, 2024)\n\nIt’s an understatement to say that data contracts are universally beneficial to all data-dependent organizations.\n\nBut certain use cases and applications highlight the value of data contracts more definitively than others, like analytics databases, transactional databases, and event streaming.\n\nExample 1: Analytics databases\n\nAnalytics databases, such as data warehouses or data lakes, often aggregate immense amounts of data from multiple sources. As these databases grow, maintaining data quality becomes more difficult, especially when new datasets are introduced or existing data sources evolve.\n\nLeft unchecked, schema changes that break downstream processes can have chaotic repercussions:\n\nCorrupted reporting and analytics: When even a seemingly simple schema change is not enforced or caught early, it can lead to errors in reporting, analytics dashboards, and even machine learning models. Imagine a basic yet key field in a database like \"total sales\" being altered or removed. Dashboards that data consumers rely upon downstream might then display misleading data or fail entirely.\n\nIncreased business decision risks: Analytics databases are commonly used to derive insights that inform business strategy. Therefore, incorrect or incomplete data can hamstring data-driven decision-making. In these instances, stakeholders and executives might base their actions on misleading information—like underestimating product demand or making incorrect financial projections—which could then result in lost revenue, flawed campaign strategies, or reputational damage to the organization itself.\n\nLonger debugging and fixing cycles: Without data contracts to enforce schema validation, engineers and data scientists can get left on the hook, spending considerable time manually troubleshooting why certain processes are failing. This can bog down (or outright stall) critical business operations and divert resources from more valuable tasks.\n\nOn these modern data platforms, however, data contracts enforce quality across multiple data sources, ensuring that downstream analytics remain accurate. Tools like dbt (data build tool) integrate with data contracts to ensure that transformations performed on analytics databases follow schema and business logic rules.\n\nBy enforcing schema consistency, changes to a dataset’s structure (e.g., adding new columns or renaming an existing column) cannot break mission-critical downstream analytics processes like dashboards or machine learning models.\n\nThis does more than keep organizational data pipelines running smoothly. Data contracts ensure that all insights and reports derived from upstream databases are, and will remain, accurate.\n\nExample 2: Transactional databases\n\nTransactional databases—think those used in ecommerce or customer management systems (CMS)—deliver value by capturing and processing real-time operational data. When taken as a whole, this immense amount of data, order information, payment information, and customer profiles are often leveraged in the aggregate to become a single source of truth for core business functions.\n\nAs such, this data must remain exceptionally consistent over time for business models to improve. Data inconsistencies, then, create issues that naturally eat into this “truth” that business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) companies must rely on:\n\nBilling errors and financial loss: At the most basic level, severe financial issues can occur if the data used for transactions is inconsistent or inaccurate. Take a business shifting from a B2C to B2B model. If its data schema is not updated to handle corporate accounts, invoices could then be sent to incorrect entities or with the wrong amounts, resulting in significant revenue loss or legal disputes.\n\nOperational disruptions: Since transactional databases often serve as the backbone for retail businesses, business logic needs to be enforced properly. When it isn’t, this can disrupt operations as a whole—from inventory and order fulfillment to customer management. When this happens, business operations may halt completely, leading to costly delays.\n\nCustomer relationship damage: There’s often more than money on the line, as inaccurate customer data can result in poor service or communication. Imagine, due to operational disruptions, orders are delayed or delivered to incorrect addresses. Then customer service representatives who are given outdated or incorrect information are expected to resolve these issues. It becomes easy to see how negative reviews and customer churn would quickly impact an organization’s brand, not just its bottom line.\n\nThat said, changes of this sort are exceptionally common in B2B and B2C organizations, as businesses naturally evolve and expand. The data contract is what keeps business growth on track, enforcing business logic and ensuring data remains consistent with a given business's needs.\n\nBy defining clear rules, data contracts help manage dependencies between various data assets, ensuring that changes in one area do not disrupt downstream processes. Additionally, in this example, contracts also ensure ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance, maintaining data consistency and accuracy as business models evolve, while minimizing the risk of data corruption in critical systems.\n\nExample 3: Event streaming\n\nEvent-driven systems handle real-time data and can involve complex interactions, such as user activity tracking, IoT device data, or financial transactions.\n\nAs these systems mature and gain further adoption, and the subsequent volume and velocity of data increase proportionally, ensuring data consistency becomes a significant challenge, especially in distributed systems.\n\nThis is what makes event-driven systems particularly vulnerable to real-time data inconsistencies—race conditions, event duplication, etc. And, unfortunately, it doesn’t take a big inconsistency to cause major problems in the moment:\n\nData integrity breakdown: As mentioned, inconsistencies can lead to corrupted data in real-time systems, especially those relying on event-driven architectures (that is, systems where the outcome of an event depends on the sequence or timing of events that occur simultaneously or close together). This could be as simple as the processing of a cancellation order that hasn’t yet been placed. It’s a hiccup, but one that could leave a system in an incorrect state, or one that leads to incorrect information downstream, further undermining data integrity.\n\nOperational latency and failures: Event streaming often requires low-latency processing to handle high volumes of data in real time. Without data contracts enforcing data quality and structure, invalid or malformed events can slow down processing pipelines, cause failures in real-time applications, and lead to delayed responses. In industries like finance or telecommunications, these delays could lead to missed opportunities or regulatory violations.\n\nCritical system outages: If event streaming systems break down due to inconsistent or corrupt data, it can lead to larger system outages. For instance, a streaming service that relies on real-time telemetry data for monitoring system health could be blind to performance issues, resulting in prolonged downtime or service degradation that affects customers and revenue.\n\nIn event streaming, data contracts enforce structure and data quality rules when APIs transfer real-time data across systems. By doing so, the contract ensures that event information (such as user updates or financial transactions) remains valid and consistent, regardless of how many times it is processed.\n\nWhile the streaming infrastructure handles event sequencing, data contracts prevent issues like corrupt data or out-of-schema events from being processed, preserving data quality and reliability in distributed environments.\n\nFrom examples to education: Working together to draft a better way forward\n\n“What makes data contracts powerful is what also makes them difficult to implement. The power of data contracts is that they're designed to unite teams and disciplines across an entire company, while also integrating seamlessly into the individual tools and workflows at all stages of the data lifecycle.” — Data Contracts: Building Production Grade Pipelines at Scale (O’Reilly, 2024)\n\nOn its own, this quote encapsulates the inherent challenge of data contracts. It does, however, also tip a hat toward the solution: education and advocacy.\n\nData contracts are indeed powerful. In addition to the practical examples in this article, they also have the power to unify various teams and disciplines within an organization around common data standards and expectations.\n\nBut this exceptional integrativeness can be hampered by challenges with data contract implementation and support—let alone buy-in from organizational leadership and stakeholders, each with competing priorities and knowledge bases.\n\nSo, alignment is key for unleashing the benefits that data contracts can (and should) provide for data teams worldwide. Which brings us back to the quote, and those featured throughout the article. Truth be told, the book they’re all from—Data Contracts: Building Production Grade Pipelines at Scale—is, actually, the very first book from Gable.ai.\n\nWritten by our own Chad Sanderson and Mark Freeman (and published by our awesome friends at O’Reilly), the book is our sincere attempt to help spark more education and advocacy amongst our data engineering peers. We’d love for you to grab your own free copy, as soon as it’s available. Especially if you believe in the power data contracts can and do have in modern organizations, but maybe sometimes struggle to articulate exactly how.\n\nThat said, we’re still a few weeks away from our publishing date.

      "# [Structured Data: Examples and How to Manage](https://www.gable.ai/blog/semi-structured-data)\nIt makes sense that data professionals can get quite accustomed to operating in a binary world. Data flows through an ETL pipeline, or it doesn’t. Data will either meet the standards of an organization’s data quality rules, or it won’t. Downstream data consumers will either bring you candy and treats due to the quality they enjoy, or (unfortunately, we hate to say it) they won’t.\n\nTo be, or not to be…validated by an automated hand, as data doth embark upon its journey from the very dawn of its lifecycle (as it were).\n\n‍\n\nBut this binary “bias” can cause some confusion when professionals run into aspects of the data engineering world that are neither this nor that—semi-structured data being a prime example.\n\nThat said, the reasons can be less than obvious depending on one’s background and experience.\n\nSo let’s make sure we know what semi-structured data is, how being both structured and unstructured can create some semi-serious issues, and how specific solutions (like data contracts) can help min/max this category of data in practice.\n\nWhat is semi-structured data?\n\nSemi-structured data is a type of data that doesn’t conform to the rigid structure of traditional databases but still contains some organizational properties. It exists between structured data, which fits neatly into tables with predefined schemas, and unstructured data, which lacks a specific format or organization.\n\nIn the world of data analytics—and, by extension, big data—semi-structured data plays a critical role by offering a flexible model for storing and managing data that doesn’t fit into neat categories the way so many other aspects of data engineering do.\n\nThis flexibility allows companies to capture diverse data formats, such as JSON, which is commonly (and increasingly) used for data transfer in APIs and IoT devices. JSON’s flexibility allows developers to easily transmit data without needing to adhere to a rigid schema.\n\nExamples of semi-structured data\n\nOn the whole, semi-structured data stands apart because it doesn’t adhere to a rigid, tabular schema like structured data, but it also isn’t as freeform as unstructured data. Here’s why these examples fall into the semi-structured category:\n\nLack of fixed schema: Unlike structured data, semi-structured data doesn’t require a fixed schema. This flexibility allows it to handle various data formats, which makes it ideal for applications that process big data from multiple sources.\n\nUse of tags and metadata: Semi-structured data uses tags or metadata to provide a level of organization. This allows for complex relationships between data elements, which is crucial for managing and analyzing data that comes from diverse sources like web logs, IoT sensors, or mobile devices.\n\nHierarchical organization: Formats like XML and JSON allow for hierarchical relationships between data elements, making them ideal for storing and querying nested structures in large-scale data management systems or data lakes.\n\nThe hybrid nature of semi-structured data makes it a practical choice for companies needing flexible data models that can adapt to changing requirements while still enabling efficient querying and data analysis.\n\nSemi-structured data balances structure and flexibility. Although it doesn’t follow the strict rules of relational databases, it still uses metadata, tags, or markers to create an organizational framework that unstructured data lacks. As a result, semi-structured data can take a multitude of forms:\n\nXML (Extensible Markup Language): XML allows users to define custom tags and attributes, providing a hierarchical structure. This is especially useful for exchanging complex data structures between systems, including data warehouses or other large-scale data management systems.\n\nJSON (JavaScript Object Notation): JSON organizes data using key-value pairs and supports nested structures. Widely used in APIs—where data is transmitted between clients and servers—JSON is easy to use and store.\n\nHTML (HyperText Markup Language): HTML, used to create web pages, is considered semi-structured because it organizes content hierarchically with tags. This structure allows for data analysis of web-based content, enabling search engines and content management systems to efficiently organize and retrieve information.\n\nEmails: Emails combine structured elements (like sender, recipient, date, and subject) with unstructured content (the body of the email). This makes emails a mix of structured and unstructured data, often requiring specialized tools for data analytics to extract useful insights.\n\nNoSQL database records: NoSQL databases are commonly used to store semi-structured data. They do not require a fixed schema, allowing each record to have a different structure. This makes NoSQL databases flexible but also presents challenges in storing data efficiently as datasets scale.\n\nThe different ways companies use semi-structured, structured, and unstructured data\n\nThis versatility is a boon for organizations, as semi-structured data is used to integrate disparate systems, manage evolving data requirements, and unlock insights from diverse sources. Here's how semi-structured data compares to structured and unstructured data in real-world use cases:\n\nUses for semi-structured data\n\nFlexibility and scalability: Semi-structured data formats like JSON and XML allow companies to store and process information without a rigid schema. This flexibility is particularly useful in data warehouses and data lakes, where data from various sources needs to be integrated without heavy restructuring.\n\nData integration: Semi-structured data helps companies integrate information from multiple platforms, enabling smoother data exchange and consolidation. This is especially important in industries dealing with large volumes of big data, such as ecommerce, where information flows from different systems (web, mobile, APIs).\n\nUse cases: Semi-structured data is commonly used in data analytics applications like sentiment analysis, natural language processing (NLP), and log analysis. Its ability to handle irregular and incomplete datasets allows companies to extract meaningful insights, even from fragmented or complex data sources.\n\nUses for structured data\n\nEase of use and analysis: Structured data is highly organized and stored in relational databases with predefined schemas, making it easier to query and analyze using standard tools like SQL. This type of data is often used in systems where predictability and consistency are key, such as financial databases or data warehouses.\n\nPredictability and reliability: The rigid schema of structured data ensures efficient storage and retrieval, making it ideal for applications that require consistent, reliable outputs, such as CRM systems or inventory management.\n\nUses for unstructured data\n\nRich insights and innovation: Unstructured data, such as text, images, videos, and social media content, provides deep insights that structured data alone cannot offer. Companies use this type of data for data analytics projects that involve sentiment analysis, market research, and customer feedback, gaining insights that can drive innovation.\n\nComplexity and tools: Analyzing unstructured data often requires advanced tools like machine learning or data analytics platforms. Although complex, these tools allow businesses to tap into valuable qualitative insights hidden within vast amounts of unstructured data.\n\nBy leveraging the unique strengths of each data type—semi-structured, structured, and unstructured—companies can tailor their data management strategies to meet different analytical needs and business objectives.\n\nSolutions for managing semi-structured data\n\nAs mentioned, the “this and that”-ness of semi-structured data leads to some particular challenges. But these challenges, fortunately, can be minimized (if not mitigated) through enacting simple yet impactful solutions:\n\nLeveraging NoSQL Databases: Certain databases—such as MongoDB and Couchbase—are well-suited for storing semi-structured data due to their flexible schemas, which can handle varied data formats efficiently.\n\nAdopt a Schema-on-Read Approach: This method applies a schema only when the data is queried, rather than during ingestion. Tools like Apache Hive, Hadoop, and AWS Athena use this approach, making it easier to process large amounts of data in a data warehouse or data lake environment.\n\nMake data validation consistent: Regular data validation and transformation processes can help ensure data quality by checking for consistency, completeness, and accuracy across semi-structured datasets.\n\nImplement data contracts: Data contracts ensure that the structure and quality of semi-structured data are maintained as it flows through different stages of the pipeline. These contracts act as agreements between data producers and consumers, setting clear rules for what the data should look like—and ensuring that edge cases or inconsistencies (such as missing fields in nested JSON objects) are caught early.\n\nBy employing these strategies (the more, frankly, the better), companies can efficiently manage semi-structured data alongside structured and unstructured data, ensuring their data management efforts scale with business needs.\n\nMinimizing the slings and arrows of semi-structured data\n\nIn the world of data, much like Hamlet’s existential question, to be or not to be validated becomes a crucial decision point for data pipelines. Whether data conforms to the contracts set by automated governance tools or needs to be rejected and refined marks the difference between data that is ready to deliver insights and data that just adds noise to the system.\n\nThe ambiguity of semi-structured data may leave you wondering how to bring order to this complexity. Should it be treated as structured, unstructured, or somewhere in between? The answer lies in using the right tools to ensure it’s properly validated, integrated, and governed from the moment it enters your system.\n\nAt Gable, we’ve crafted a solution to make this choice easier. Sign up for our waitlist to learn how we help data teams resolve the “to be or not to be” dilemma with automation, contracts, and governance solutions that are purpose-built for the challenges of semi-structured data.",
      "# [OLTP vs OLAP: What's the Difference?](https://www.gable.ai/blog/oltp-vs-olap)\nIn the world of blog writing, “x vs. y” is a common theme. Contrasting two concepts, products, or services provides several cognitive advantages. Comparisons highlight both unique characteristics and shared features. Understanding the relationship between two items requires critical thinking and analysis. We also tend to learn better when information is presented in context, as opposed to abstraction.\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\nHowever, OLTP (online transaction processing) vs. OLAP (online analytical processing) is a special case in the data space. Because OLTP and OLAP are, quite frequently, at odds with each other. Writing for the Data Products Substack, Gable.ai’s Mark Freeman shares his first-hand account of the problematic ways OLTP and OLAP can shape the “data worldview” of their users:\n\nIn my last role as a data scientist, I was hired at an HR tech company specifically to translate between the engineering and research teams, essentially turning analytics and I/O psychology theory into data products.\n\nDespite both teams having the same ultimate goal of building amazing HR data products, I experienced firsthand the breakdown of communication and misunderstanding of needs amongst these two groups through this translation work. Upon talking to others in the data industry I quickly learned that this challenge wasn’t unique to my job, but rather an endemic issue across data teams of various company sizes.\n\nFortunately, Mark’s experiences have also led him to some thoughts on how OLTP and OLAP practitioners can bridge the “versus” gap in their actual working environments. But first, let’s cover what these two forms of data processing are, the roles they play, and where the complications arise.\n\nOLTP and OLAP data processing\n\nIn the context of the data space OLTP and OLAP are two fundamental concepts that serve different but complementary purposes, both in managing and utilizing data within organizations.\n\nOLTP at a glance\n\nBasic role\n\nOLTP systems are designed to manage transaction-oriented applications. As such, they are optimized to handle large numbers of short atomic (i.e., indivisible), and often simple operations.\n\nPrimarily, these operations are involved in many day-to-day transactions that help a business operate like order entry, retail sales, financial transactions, and customer relationship interactions.\n\nKey characteristics\n\nOperationally focused, directly involved in business operations\n\nHigh throughput for short operations like create, read, update, and delete (CRUD)\n\nEnsures data integrity in real-time\n\nDeal with current data that is highly detailed\n\nUse case examples\n\nBanking systems\n\nOnline booking systems\n\nRetail point of sale (POS) systems\n\nOLAP at a glance\n\nBasic role\n\nOLAP systems are designed for query-intensive and complex analytical calculations. These systems are optimized for data analysis and geared toward querying large sets of data at once to aid in looking for patterns, trends, and insights.\n\nThe primary role of OLAP is to aid in decision-making processes, like data mining, business intelligence (BI), and trend analysis.\n\nKey characteristics\n\nAnalytically focused, used to drive strategic business decisions\n\nVery efficient in handling complex queries that involve aggregations and joining large datasets\n\nWhen used, data is often consolidated from various OLTP databases and other sources\n\nInvolves historical data analysis, as OLAP systems allow users to work on large volumes of historical data to derive insights over time\n\nUse case examples\n\nFinancial reporting, customer relationship management (CRM) analytics, data warehousing systems\n\nHow OLTP and OLAP work together\n\nIn integrated data warehousing environments, OLTP and OLAP will often share a data source-destination relationship. OLTP systems collect data through daily business operations and then pass it to OLAP systems for analysis. As part of this process, OLTP systems typically use an Entity-Relationship (ER) model, optimized for transactional efficiency. OLAP systems, alternately, will use a star schema or snowflake schema more optimized for reading and analyzing data.\n\nThis congruent relation is important to highlight, as OLTP and OLAP, despite their differences, function as complementary systems. Due to OLTP’s focus on efficient transaction processing and OLAP’s on complex data analysis, both are often necessary for a comprehensive data strategy that is two parts of a whole.\n\nAppreciation of this interplay between OLTP and OLAP is important, as it lays a foundation for helping us appreciate how these complementary systems foster such a surprising amount of discord amongst data professionals.\n\nUnpacking the “vs.” in OLTP vs. OLAP\n\nAs Mark witnessed firsthand, the tension between OLTP data producers and OLAP data consumers stems from how these two groups approach the handling and interpretation of data. While related challenges will be unique to each organization, here are seven factors that consistently contribute to the OLTP/OLAP communication gap:\n\n1. Separate objectives and priorities\n\nAs the data producers in this equation, OLTP systems are employed in an organization to manage and process transactional data. Use cases like updating inventory and managing customer information requires immediate, real-time data. This necessitates that OLTP users prioritize operational efficiency, preserving data integrity, and sheer speed.\n\nOLAP system users, as data consumers, have very different priorities. They are looking to cast a slow, thorough gaze across large amounts of historical data in an attempt to identify trends that can improve strategic decision-making. This requires a combination of data aggregation, complex queries, and measured data analysis in order to extract insights and support long-term planning.\n\n2. Different data structures and models\n\nOLTP data producers use a normalized data model in order to reduce data redundancy and maintain data integrity. Normalized data models are also easy to organize and update, in addition to being very consistent.\n\nHowever, while these factors benefit transactional processes, normalized data models are inefficient when used for complex queries, requiring data from multiple tables. This is exactly what data analysis requires, which is why OLAP data systems frequently utilize a denormalized data model. These models organize data into large comprehensive models that facilitate querying which can be both quick and complex, by comparison.\n\n3. Misaligned interpretations of data\n\nHolding very distinct objectives, producers and users may understandably interpret the same data in very different ways. Again, producers are looking for the quickest and most efficient ways to record and retrieve transactional data so that it remains highly in sync with the real-world operations of a business. But for the consumers, working to identify trends through moment-to-moment changes would be like studying individual grains of sand to track the ebb and flow of an entire coastline.\n\n4. Distinct languages\n\nOLTP and OLAP users quite literally end up speaking very different languages.\n\nOLTP users typically leverage more technical, operational language in their work. Terms and concepts in the world of real-time transactional processes involve database management, application performance, and transactional integrity. Water-cooler discussion might center on resolving issues related to query speed, system reliability, and database normalization.\n\nMeanwhile, in the world of the OLAP user, language will be much more business and analytically focused, including business intelligence (BI) terminology, statistical analysis, and data visualization concepts. Around this respective water cooler, practitioners might instead discuss data warehousing, business metrics, dimensional modeling, and big data analytics.\n\n5. Data quality and transformation issues\n\nAs data moves from an OLTP to an OLAP system, issues can arise regarding data quality and transformation. Attempts to resolve these issues through denormalization or integration from additional sources can result in misalignments concerning data accuracy, timeliness, and completeness.\n\n6. Complexity in business logic\n\nThe business logic used to great effect in OLTP environments may not translate cleanly into an OLAP system.\n\nFor example, in a sales environment, every time a customer makes a purchase, inventory needs to be updated, sales details need to be captured, and loyalty or rewards points might even need to be tallied–all of which an OLTP system would log behind the scenes. Business logic in this example would involve immediate updates to ensure inventory accuracy, recording of sales details, and updates to customer profiles. Stock quantities need to be decremented and loyalty points incremented.\n\nDownstream, however, OLAP users are working to analyze sales data over time to help stakeholders make strategic decisions, like understanding the seasonality of customer buying patterns and predicting future inventory needs. This changes the business logic. Here, the focus is not on individual transactions and instead is on aggregating the sales data over time. Users and their systems might look to calculate average sale values per customer, or to review years of historical sales data to improve their ability to forecast future stock requirements.\n\nNo surprise then, that in our example business logic from the former would not seamlessly transfer to the latter. While still complementary, disparate logic would need to be corrected each time a data transfer is made, resulting in the aforementioned discrepancies with how the data needs to be understood and used.\n\n7. Different performance metrics\n\nFinally, both professional camps would be equally concerned with measuring success. But while OLTPs would be judged based on metrics like transaction throughput and response time, OLAPs would instead like to be indicators of data freshness and query response time. Even when all involved in a given organization understand the metrics used by the other party, there’s no reason to believe they’ll inherently value them accordingly.\n\nHow then to bridge the OLTP vs. OLAP gap?\n\nNot only is the OLTP vs. OLAP issue interesting to consider, but overcoming it may prove instructive, as more “versus” situations may be ahead, with more organizations using more data more of the time. But Mark’s own experiences lead us to a conclusion we can build on:\n\n...the solution to this divide between OLTP and OLAP database users is not to force the benefits of one side or the other but to instead foster empathy so that both sides can translate the needs of each other...we made great strides by including the data consumers in the product requirements document (PRD) writing phase. It worked well because we added the OLAP perspective before data producers were constrained by existing requirements to deliver a product on a tight deadline. For the data consumers, we finally had an opportunity to see upstream and learn the product constraints that impacted our business logic.\n\nBut, as Mark notes, any solution that bridges this gap needs to scale in order to be effective. Because when they don’t, teams drift back into their comfort zones, perpetuating the OLAT vs. OLAP issues.\n\nUltimately, this led Mark to realize data contracts are the ideal avenue through which to scale and maintain empathy between OLTP and OLAP users—creating ecosystems where data sharing and analysis are not only more efficient but also more aligned with the needs and expectations of all parties involved.\n\nMoreover, it also led Mark to Gable.ai, where he’s now part of our passionate team, working to transform how data producers and consumers work together.",
      "# [Top 5 Data Lineage Tools (+ How to Choose)](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-lineage-tools)\nThe good news is that business leaders and stakeholders are increasingly seeing the value of data lineage in their organizations. The even better news is that the data lineage tool market offers more options for data teams every year.\n\nAs a whole, the global data catalog market is projected to grow from $878.8 million in 2023 to $4,680.9 million by 2032, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.7% during this period. That’s respectable.\n\nSo, as more data teams enter the market for lineage tools, it’s important to distinguish the apples from the oranges. Much like data lineage itself, knowledge is power when it comes to vetting potential lineage tools.\n\nThat's why we’re showcasing five potentially potent tools for data lineage here, noting the pros, cons, and pricing for each.\n\nData lineage tools: 5 worth considering\n\nGable.ai\n\nGable is a pioneering data contracts platform that's proactively bridging the gap between data producers and consumers.

These tools provide an audit trail demonstrating how data is used and processed, facilitating compliance reporting and audits.\n\nStreamlined data governance\n\nData lineage simplifies data governance by providing a clear understanding of data assets, their ownership, and the impact of made changes. As a result, lineage tools make it easier to enforce data policies and maintain optimal data quality.\n\nFaster troubleshooting and issue resolution\n\nWhen data issues arise, lineage tools enable faster troubleshooting by allowing data professionals to trace problems back to their source, identify root causes, and implement solutions as quickly as possible.\n\nEnhanced data security\n\nData lineage helps organizations identify vulnerabilities in their data pipelines and access controls, allowing for the implementation of robust security measures to safeguard sensitive information.\n\nEffective change management\n\nBy visualizing how data flows are impacted by changes, teams can assess potential risks and make informed decisions during system upgrades or process modifications.\n\nSupport for data-driven decision making\n\nData lineage empowers more people (both data professionals and their data-adjacent peers) to understand and leverage data assets, supporting true data democratization and enabling more informed decision-making throughout the organization.\n\nOperational efficiency\n\nBy automating data mapping and reducing the need for manual impact analysis, data lineage tools can save significant time and resources, enhancing overall operational efficiency.\n\nRisk management\n\nData lineage manages risks associated with data usage, transformations, and access by providing a comprehensive view of data flow and dependencies.\n\nHow to choose the right data lineage tool\n\nSituations, organizational needs, technical capabilities, and lineage tools themselves are all always in flux—so there will never be a one “best” way to go about choosing the right data lineage tool.\n\nThat said, by carefully considering the following factors and aligning them with your organization's specific requirements, you can streamline to process of learning about and comparing tools, ensuring the chosen tool provides the most value and the best fit possible:\n\nDetermine scope and depth of lineage tracking: Look for tools that provide comprehensive lineage at multiple levels—table, column, and row-level lineage. Ensure the tool captures lineage across your entire data ecosystem, not just from limited sources like BI tools.\n\nReview integration capabilities: The tool should integrate well with your existing data stack, including data warehouses, ETL/ELT tools, BI platforms, etc. Check the depth of integrations—some tools may claim to integrate with a platform but only offer surface-level connectivity.\n\nCompare visualization and analysis features: Clear, intuitive visualizations of data lineage are crucial for understanding complex data flows. Look for capabilities like impact analysis, data flow mapping, and the ability to trace data upstream and downstream.\n\nDetermine if automation and metadata collection is necessary: Automated lineage capture reduces manual effort and improves accuracy. The tool should be able to automatically collect and update metadata as your data environment changes.\n\nVet each tool’s ability to scale: Ensure the tool can handle your current data volume and complexity, as well as scale as your data ecosystem grows.\n\nConsider usability and accessibility: The tool should be user-friendly for both technical and non-technical team members. Features like search functionality and collaborative capabilities are valuable.\n\nInquire about compliance and governance support: If regulatory compliance is a concern, look for tools that offer features to support data governance and compliance efforts.\n\nAsses potential performance impact: Consider how the lineage tool might affect the performance of your data systems, especially for large-scale implementations.\n\nWeigh cost against potential ROI: Evaluate the pricing model and ensure it aligns with your budget and expected value from implementing data lineage.\n\nPrioritize future-proofing: Choose a tool that can adapt to evolving data architectures and technologies.\n\nGet a sense of each tool’s support and community: Consider the level of support provided by the vendor and the existence of an active user community for knowledge sharing.\n\nDetermine if complementary features are available: Some tools offer additional features like data quality monitoring or data cataloging that may provide added value.\n\nLooking to shift your lineage left?\n\nAgain, the right data lineage tools can dramatically enhance data governance, transparency, and quality within your organization. But it should now be crystal clear that choosing the right solution is crucial. Whether you're looking to streamline compliance, ensure data accuracy, or improve decision-making, having the right tool in your data stack is non-negotiable.\n\nGable.ai goes beyond traditional lineage solutions by introducing proactive data contracts, which tackle data quality at the source.

Insurance carriers got sick of this, and just start dropping people when their roof gets over certain age, or if it's in a certain condition.\n\nSo basically the storm chaser roofers won.

We made a claim since some of our solar panels took a beating.  Tennis ball-size hail at the speed of gravity will have that effect, if you throw enough ice balls at the panels.  \n\nState Farm sent their people over - they had a team up here since there were a lot of claims.  Looked at our 25-ish year old steel roof and decided it also got damaged in the storm.  Beyond a bunch of dents (builds character) it's functioning fine.  I don't care about the dents - nobody looks at them except us.  \n\nNope.  They're forking out a boatload to do 9,000 sf of steel roof on the house and shop building, along with some siding that could be replaced for a few thousand with labor.  Gutters, too.  And the garden shed that has a steel roof and siding.  The claim amount is just over 1/3 what we paid for the place in 2016.  The roofing contractor - same folks who installed it way back when - says it's functionally fine (even though they have a financial interest in replacing it).  I suppose SF could drop us if we don't make the repairs, so I guess we'll be picking out a new roof color.  \n\nAll we wanted was replacement of the solar panels and a little more for some minor siding damage.\n\n#### Comment ID k0h7i1j with +1 score by [(UpUpWeGo21, Reddit, 2023-09-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roofing/comments/16hetjg/my_home_insurance_is_dropping_me_because_of/k0h7i1j/) (in reply to ID k0ga000):\nI worked on the contractor side and have helped people get a lot of things replaced from storm damages \nLegit damage I've never told anyone to file a claim if they didn't have any damage\nBut the age of the roof doesn't affect it being replaced because of storm damages. \nIn fact it's easier to get those replaced because after a certain point you can't repair without causing more damage so they are forced to replace\n\n### Comment ID k0gcvrq with +2 score by [(code-brown, Reddit, 2023-09-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roofing/comments/16hetjg/my_home_insurance_is_dropping_me_because_of/k0gcvrq/) (in reply to ID k0e9ofu):\nWe are having a new roof installed as I type this for this exact reason.

White area looks newer, likely the area that was replaced, the brown area has plenty of issues present. I have been witnessing insurance carriers dropping people in any hurricane area trying to reduce their exposure in these states. I subcontract to about a dozen carriers on any given year. They are using any excuse in the book, and most of them are as flimsy as this. Your first photo shows lifted shingles all over which is likely related to nail pops. It happens, sometimes a little sometimes a lot. The curling at the eaves is usually do to poor sheathing coverage at the eaves, sometimes due to rot at the eaves, sometimes both. They will assume rot and maintenance issues and drop you. I would replace your back slope, address the sheathing, and get new insurance asap. Insurance with a roof less than 3 years old will be simple. You can lawyer up but realize that it’s throwing good money after bad. Almost every carrier is trying to shrink their exposure. Lawyers suing for everything is why. They will fight for your cause but it’s not a winning one in this case. People think that everything is an insurance claim, lawyers telling them that is sure is… just to get the lawsuit going. Well it’s not, but the consumer protections are too favorable for the consumer which means it’s easy to get a concession from the insurance company. Which is considered a win for the lawyer, and in most states that means the carrier has to pay all lawyer fees. So you may feel you get a win, a new roof slope or get something covered that was related to rot (never covered). You get 2/5/20k in repairs you shouldn’t have, but the Lawyers bill for 20/40/60k and you never see it or know about it. I watch claims for a simple 25k roof replacement hit 100-200k constantly all due to lawyers and PAs. That’s what’s destroying our home rates.  \n\nI’m much more a fan of Canadian insurance methods. They fix your home and you cannot sue. It means they get to focus on fixing correctly and not have to defend against nuisance lawsuits. Contractors fix what’s broken and get paid directly in most cases.\n\n### Comment ID k0f0s5b with +3 score by [(Ghinasucks, Reddit, 2023-09-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roofing/comments/16hetjg/my_home_insurance_is_dropping_me_because_of/k0f0s5b/) (in reply to ID k0e0kgo):\nBingo!\n\n### Comment ID k0ge6d0 with +4 score by [(sbarrio2, Reddit, 2023-09-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roofing/comments/16hetjg/my_home_insurance_is_dropping_me_because_of/k0ge6d0/) (in reply to ID k0e0kgo):\nPublic adjusters, lawyers, and shady contractors are parasites that will be the death of affordable and accessible insurance.

There is zero reason to start with a lawsuit if your repairs are being made in a timely manner. You could replace 10 roofs for the cost of one lawsuit. Standards would be in every consumers favor if your average person stop being sheeple and carriers did right the first time, and lawyers didn’t have the ability to enrich themselves by preying on the ignorant.

Also, there's no requirement the company give time to replace. Renewal notices are heavily regulated in the number of days mailing notice they must give prior to the upcoming renewal date.  Assuming they met that, they're good.\n\nWhat the OP should be doing right now is get serious about replacing the roof and call the company to see if they'd renew with a new roof. If so, get a new roof. One is needed anyways: that slope is in piss-poor, decrepit condition.  That roof is either already leaking or will leak very soon.  Guaranteed if not replaced the OP won't be able to find another carrier, especially when they find out the policy was nonrenewed and why.\n\nAn insurance policy is not a maintenance contract.

My dad had his insurance dropped from his house because is some paint that started to peel in a section of the house that was like 12’ long and a small exterior spall in the concrete footing under the chimney that was about 4” long by less than an inch tall and at the deepest part was about 3/4”. But here is the real kicker all of the insurance companies use the same program so once one puts something in there, they all see that you are being dropped and you can not get coverage from any other company because they pull you up and site the same exact reason you are being dropped as the reason they can not cover you. Furthermore, what you also may have not realized, this may also force you to default on your mortgage. Like auto loans, the home loan is contingent on you having home owners insurance. If they drop you, you will no longer have the insurance and default on the loan. \n\nI think it is a way for the insurance companies to drop a bunch of their cheaper homes that they are covering , and later will cover your home, but as it is and at a much higher rate. Anything breaks, it is on you now, it is not covered under the new policy.

Contractors take then on because it opens the door to sell things to the homeowner that aren't covered by insurance or to upsell the homeowners from whatever is covered. It's quite possible that the contractor they hired saw that the roof was good and made up some bullshit in the hopes that they could convince you or the insurance company to buy a new roof.

Nope, people are still dumb enough to buy the metal roofs with the full knowledge it will have to be replaced no matter condition in 15 years.

I brought the solar vent thing up when I was getting estimates a couple years later for a new roof. It may have been an attempt to get the bid but they had better pricing anyway. I held off doing the solar vent because I just wasn’t sure if it would short circuit the venting between the soffits and the ridge vent. My belief is that it would but don’t know for sure.

Passive exhaust louvers at the apex of a roof that allow rising hot air to escape an attic when sufficient soffit ventilation is available to act as an intake for cooler outside air.  And where this is a hipped roof with a farily steep pitch that creates larger attic spaces, there may not have been sufficient ridge on the roof to create the volume of exhaust venting area needed to properly vent attic space--resulting in the need for the turtle vents to supplement ridge ventilation.\n\nAs long as the ratio of eave-to-ridge ventilation space is accurate, the ridge & turtle vents will work fine together in appropriately venting this home.\n\n#### Comment ID jte46ue with +7 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-07-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roofing/comments/159a0ez/neighbor_just_got_a_new_roof_is_this_combining_2/jte46ue/) (in reply to ID jte3xd2):\nI have to disagree.

Nothing to be alarmed by, they're working in tandem.\n\n## Comment ID jti6eiw with +1 score by [(PhillipJfry5656, Reddit, 2023-07-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roofing/comments/159a0ez/neighbor_just_got_a_new_roof_is_this_combining_2/jti6eiw/) (in reply to ID 159a0ez):\n100% wrong. That ridge vent will use those mushroom vents as an intake and suck moisture right in. It also pushes a lot of the air back down because of the flow u end up with.

It’s crazy to me that for how controversial this topic is, I haven’t been able to find any tests or studies to back-up either theory. My engineering brain agrees that the front box vent should be exhausting hot air due to its placement, the one farther back I’m less sure about, and then some people have made good points about even a light wind in a certain direction creating a low pressure differential around the box vent causing it to act more like a fan and pull air from the ridge (closer than the soffit and likely path of least resistance). I know definitely seems like the manufacturers want you to stick to one or the other, but I haven’t seen any test data.\n\n#### Comment ID jtl04mq with +1 score by [(PhillipJfry5656, Reddit, 2023-07-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roofing/comments/159a0ez/neighbor_just_got_a_new_roof_is_this_combining_2/jtl04mq/) (in reply to ID jtidd4m):\nIt’s not about the hot air rising.

Its users link content created elsewhere, effectively siphoning value from  \nother sources via its users.\n2. Its users create new content specifically for it, thus profiting of off the  \nfree labour and content made by its users\n\nThis means that Reddit creates no value but exploits its users to generate the  \nvalue that uses to sell advertisements, charge its users for meaningless tokens,  \nsell NFTs, and seek private investment. Reddit relies on volunteer moderation by  \npeople who receive no benefit, not thanks, and definitely no pay. Reddit is  \nprofiting entirely off all of its users doing all of the work from gathering  \nlinks, to making comments, to moderating everything, all for free. Reddit is\nalso going to sell your information, you data, your content to third party AI\ncompanies so that they can train their models on your work, your life, your\ncontent and Reddit can make money from it, all while you see nothing in return.\n\n## Lack of respect for its third party developers\n\nI'm sure everyone at this point is familiar with the API changes putting many  \nthird party application developers out of business. Reddit saw how much money  \nentities like OpenAI and other data scraping firms are making and wants a slice  \nof that pie, and doesn't care who it tramples on in the process. Third party  \ndevelopers have created tools that make the use of Reddit far more appealing and  \nfeasible for so many people, again freely creating value for the company, and  \nit doesn't care that it's killing off these initiatives in order to take some of  \nthe profits it thinks it's entitled to.\n\n## Lack of respect for other cultures\n\nReddit spreads and enforces right wing, libertarian, US values, morals, and  \nethics, forcing other cultures to abandon their own values and adopt American  \nones if they wish to provide free labour and content to a for profit American  \ncorporation. American cultural hegemony is ever present and only made worse by  \ncompanies like Reddit actively forcing their values and social mores upon  \nforeign cultures without any sensitivity or care for local values and customs.  \nMeanwhile they allow reprehensible ideologies to spread through their network  \nunchecked because, while other nations might make such hate and bigotry illegal,  \nReddit holds \"Free Speech\" in the highest regard, but only so long as it doesn't  \noffend their own American sensibilities.\n\n## Lack for respect for the truth\n\nReddit has long been associated with disinformation, conspiracy theories,  \nastroturfing, and many such targeted attacks against the truth. Again protected  \nunder a veil of \"Free Speech\", these harmful lies spread far and wide using  \nReddit as a base. Reddit allows whole deranged communities and power-mad  \nmoderators to enforce their own twisted world-views, allowing them to silence  \ndissenting voices who oppose the radical, and often bigoted, vitriol spewed by  \nthose who fear leaving their own bubbles of conformity and isolation.\n\n## Lack of respect for common decency\n\nReddit is full of hate and bigotry. Many subreddits contain casual exclusion,  \ndiscrimination, insults, homophobia, transphobia, racism, anti-semitism,  \ncolonialism, imperialism, American exceptionalism, and just general edgy hatred.  \nReddit is toxic, it creates, incentivises, and profits off of \"engagement\" and  \n\"high arousal emotions\" which is a polite way of saying \"shouting matches\" and  \n\"fear and hatred\".\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf not for ideological reasons then at least leave Reddit for personal ones. Do  \nYou enjoy endlessly scrolling Reddit? Does constantly refreshing your feed bring  \nyou any joy or pleasure? Does getting into meaningless internet arguments with  \nstrangers on the internet improve your life? Quit Reddit, if only for a few  \nweeks, and see if it improves your life.\n\nI am leaving Reddit for good.

Not entirely unlike Haman, who despite being fully aware of her Newtype abilities rejects the opportunity to connect with Kamille and understand each other.\n\nAs such, I suppose Yazan is for all intents and purpose no different from an Oldtype and by extension cannot use psycommu tech.

And depending on what story you go by prior to him attempting to perform solo rear guard duty against the assembled might of the federation space force he had been shot a few times in the chest and leg. Despite this he managed to put up so much of a fight that they decided that saturation bombardment of his location was better then sending a constant stream of soldiers and ships to their deaths. I can think of no one who was good enough to warrant that response who wasn't piloting a mobile armor or a Gundam. And because of this no one knows whether he actually died or not at Aboa Qu.

So over it I’m almost considering just leaving it that way and painting everything but I want to look clean and professional especially when my roof line is not super high all over the house.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7nfur8u1eq3c1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f4f1b7bc94717c7f6323fadc440aa8cc14075b22\n\n## Comment ID k8qpbs6 with +2 score by [(Shortafinger, Reddit, 2023-11-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Govee/comments/17slqc1/12_hour_install_ama/k8qpbs6/) (in reply to ID 17slqc1):\nAnything special you had to do?

You need to use the website on a desktop/laptop\n\n## Comment ID k2b5le5 with +2 score by [(Just_Aioli_1233, Reddit, 2023-09-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoofingSales/comments/16sqbiy/5_instant_roof_measurements/k2b5le5/) (in reply to ID 16sqbiy):\nLooks like you're using Microsoft's [building footprint data](https://github.com/microsoft/USBuildingFootprints) with [shoelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula) to calculate the area.\n\nWhat's your accuracy validation look like?\n\nIf you paired with [Lidar](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0198971509000118) lookup to determine roof pitch so you don't have to do a manual lookup, [Nearmap AI](https://help.nearmap.com/kb/articles/789-ai-pack-roof-characteristics) to determine material type and topology (hip/gable) to calculate waste factor into the results, then you'd have something pretty solid.\n\n### Comment ID k2b7dgh with +1 score by [(Easy_Engineering5480, Reddit, 2023-09-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoofingSales/comments/16sqbiy/5_instant_roof_measurements/k2b7dgh/) (in reply to ID k2b5le5):\nThanks for the feedback, yes it would be much better to calculate the pitch somehow so we can give a definite measurement instead of a pitch table. To check accuracy we have ordered some roof reports to compare. Its hard to know which one is more correct though because I haven't actually gotten up on my roof and measured it by hand. The building footprints look pretty accurate though\n\n#### Comment ID k2b9hss with +3 score by [(Just_Aioli_1233, Reddit, 2023-09-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoofingSales/comments/16sqbiy/5_instant_roof_measurements/k2b9hss/) (in reply to ID k2b7dgh):\nI would recommend hand measurements as your baseline.

Try at a different location to see if you can get them to work.\n\nNearmap doesn't do self-service. You contact them and they assign a salesperson to coordinate what data you buy access to at what price. IIRC ours was in the range of $0.50 - $0.65 per API call. But that was at a volume of a couple million calls per year, with quarterly payments. So, very spendy. Which is a bad idea for Nearmap, since despite being the incumbent giant for so long, their marginal cost in providing the data is low enough they could choose to be quite affordable and expand their customer base, saving money by going self-service to make their product more approachable. Since so many other options exist they need to adapt or else suffer from pricing themselves out of the market.\n\n## Comment ID lo033es with +1 score by [(Training-Farm-5367, Reddit, 2024-09-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoofingSales/comments/16sqbiy/5_instant_roof_measurements/lo033es/) (in reply to ID 16sqbiy):\nHey there!

This is the first \"double snooted\" Noodle I've seen. In Hoomans, the duplication usually involves the trachea (windpipe) and arises where the airways for each lung joins into one trachea and usually either dead ends or rejoins the main airway just below the larynx (voicebox). Usually, people live completely unaware of the duplication, unless it's discovered accidentally. I would LOVE to see radiographs of this Noodle.

Everything above the level of the lungs does not participate in gas exchange, they're just \"pipes\". And, it \"could\" work against the dog, bigger pipes means more dead air space.

There is a law in physics (Poiseuille's iirc),  that defines that a little more. I'd have to think doggo would be limited by the smallest single portion of the larger airways. If the double lasts all the way do the smaller conducting airways, he might be able to move more air easily and thus use less energy for breathing and increase gas exchange in the alveoli. That might give him longer endurance and might increase his lung efficiency for gas exchange. If though at the point where all of that comes together is narrowed, then you'd get the opposite effect. Think of an asthmatic when their airways constrict.\n\nPlease notice my use of the word MIGHT lol, I stand to be correct by a vet or human vet.\n\nThat's kinda what I think of when trying to apply my human anatomy to the noodles.

      "# Post ID 14yr2ex: Many great wrestlers from places like Russia or Iran would not make it to D1 or the Olympics if they trained in the US system. Why? with +170 score by [(Dr_jitsu, Reddit, 2023-07-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wrestling/comments/14yr2ex/many_great_wrestlers_from_places_like_russia_or/)\nHas anyone noticed the 10 million posts we get asking \"can I make it to the Olympics, I''m starting at age 14\" or \"can I make it to D1 I'm a freshman\" we get here on reddit? Almost invariably the answer is no....because that is the reality.\n\nOn the other hand, many great wrestlers from places like Russia and Iran started at that same age and win world medals. In the US you pretty much have to be dominant from day 1 in high school (or at least your sophomore year) to have a shot at D 1. Thats not going to happen if you just started wrestling at 14. For example my son's coach this summer Babak Nourzad started wresting at 14 and made the Olympics for Iran. Russia produces waaaaay more world and Olympic champs than the US and many started in what would have been their freshman year of high school. It seems that in the US you need titles by your sophomore year in the US for a D1 school to recruit you, which won't happen your second year of wrestling. In the US, except maybe for Lee Kemp, you pretty much never make it to the top starting in your freshman year.\n\nThis seems to be a huge discrepancy to me. Russia and Iran turn 14 year olds into Olympians, while America fails to do so. We train just as hard as evidenced by our conditioning. What are we doing wrong? Are they training smarter?\n\nEdit: Since my original post I put up some data to support my position: Several countries produce 3 times the world champions than the US. Given more time I can find more. Japan (of course mainly their women) should also be on that list.\n\nThe average starting age is significantly more than 10.27 years [https://grapplingschool.com/which-country-is-best-at-wrestling/](https://grapplingschool.com/which-country-is-best-at-wrestling/)  \n\n\nEdit #2: Here is the data on medal count:\n\n.[https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/188790](https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/188790)[https://grapplingschool.com/which-country-is-best-at-wrestling/](https://grapplingschool.com/which-country-is-best-at-wrestling/)\n\n## Comment ID jrtva7f with +196 score by [(Azulaatlantica, Reddit, 2023-07-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wrestling/comments/14yr2ex/many_great_wrestlers_from_places_like_russia_or/jrtva7f/) (in reply to ID 14yr2ex):\n\"Are they training smarter?\"\n\nWell the US is the ones known for conditioning while Iran and (especially) Russia is known for technique, of course they would understand training better from an educational stand point\n\n### Comment ID jrukioi with +35 score by [(Dr_jitsu, Reddit, 2023-07-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wrestling/comments/14yr2ex/many_great_wrestlers_from_places_like_russia_or/jrukioi/) (in reply to ID jrtva7f):\nAbsolutely correct. I think you are getting to the core of the answers. But they also start later. I was looking at a list and it ranked wrestlers by the number of world and Olympic medals. Now granted, IMO, an Olympic gold should count for more than a world gold, but the bottom line was that 8 out of 15 were from Russia/former Soviet Union and only 3 were from the US. I provide some more data below.\n\nThe populations are pretty similar so there is no denying that they produce more champions. I think 2 or 3 were from Iran, but that have a much smaller population.\n\n#### Comment ID jrw8xy2 with +20 score by [(YERA_B, Reddit, 2023-07-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wrestling/comments/14yr2ex/many_great_wrestlers_from_places_like_russia_or/jrw8xy2/) (in reply to ID jrukioi):\nI don't understand why you think that Russians start training later. Usually, they start training at the very early ages like 5-6-7 or even earlier. I am not from Russia, I'm from Kazakhstan, but we still have this soviet methodology of training. My parents have sent me to train judo when I was 5. There were a lot of kids with whom we trained.

Eastern block countries have a long history of training athletes from very early childhood. I mean the U.S.S.R had state training camps identifying children very early on and sending them to training centers.  Any Soviet era athletes please chime in….\n\nAlso, wrestling in the USA is centered on higher education which is definitely the end goal. Making it to Cornell, Princeton, Brown or Stanford has a much better financial outcome for our athletes and is problematic to developing olympians. Why go make $0 dollars and eat at the cafeteria in Colorado Springs when you can go work towards the American dream. Also our insistence on folk style and especially college with riding time, it’s counterproductive to Olympic wrestling.

Almost without fail US wrestlers in D1 start at around 6-7 or so and Russians start quite a bit later as laid out in the article above. I have to find the article, it is from one of the top Russian wrestling administrators but he discusses this fact in detail. He lays out very good reasons for starting older and also keeping more focus on technique which seems to have more advantages to the US focus on conditioning at such a young age.\n\nHere is another one about the topic and the number of world champions. Russia/The Soviet Union produces nearly 3 times the amount that the US produces.\n\n[https://grapplingschool.com/which-country-is-best-at-wrestling/](https://grapplingschool.com/which-country-is-best-at-wrestling/)\n\nRussia/The Soviet Union has produced nearly 700 World champions, the US only 256. You will see in the article that Japan has also produced more than the US (of course it is mostly their women) but with a much, much smaller population. Things are a bit closer in regards to the Olympics, we actually stack up pretty well, but the Soviets sill have more.

Clearly this is younger than the US. Also, if you read the conclusion you will see that the US numbers were included (even though it was winning European titles) and that this number skewed the overall numbers lower. Without the US numbers the average starting age would have been higher than 10.27. The article does cite an article that suggests that learning throwing techniques is best started before 14. Then again Karelin started at 14.\n\n[https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/188790](https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/188790)\n\nAlso, wrestlers peak between ages 24 and 27. It takes 14.67 years to peak.

Fully 1/3 of my HS wrestling program (me included!) and like 90% of +160lb weightclasses took up the sport as a way to learn leverage, body positioning, etc, to become better football players. Despite all being reasonable strong and well-rounded athletes, we were *so* behind the technical curve. We also prioritized football camps in the summer over wrestling camps. As an adult grappler 20+ years later, I seriously lament passing on an invite to a Greco camp in NJ when I was \\~16. Even so, I'd bet if I went back and looked we all averaged .500-.750 win rates, just based on strength/speed/athleticism.\n\nYouth/HS Football in America goes beyond an extracurricular activity, sport, or hobby. It's a cultural institution. It's akin to soccer in the UK, or cricket in India. It's got an absolute grip on young athletes, who give up a disproportionate amount of their time to fight for positions on teams where only \\~30-40% of the players actually take the field (and even then, many only play half of the actual gametime due to the offense/defense split). It's also a sport that's pretty much impossible to play at the amateur level as an adult, so 99% of youth football player's careers are finished, forever, by their 19th birthday. It's the sport that more than any other has made Americans a nation of \"watchers\" rather than \"players\". \n\nI know this went a little askew from OP's original point, but I agree emphatically that a big piece of the puzzle he's trying to solve for is that the mystery American newbie 14-yr-olds that could become world champions get sucked into the Football System, and wrestling ends up getting dominated by the kids who'd been on the mat since age 6-7, well ahead of the learning curve.\n\n#### Comment ID jrw1wf7 with +2 score by [(Dr_jitsu, Reddit, 2023-07-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wrestling/comments/14yr2ex/many_great_wrestlers_from_places_like_russia_or/jrw1wf7/) (in reply to ID jruyesf):\nGreat post...this was happening to my son. He started and played both ways (football) in 8th grade then started full time as a linebacker his freshman year and then made the JV A team (there is an A and B team) his sophomore year. This was for a top football school in Texas (former 6A state champion). I saw that he was getting less and less time in football and predicted he would make varsity by his Junior year but probably would not get a lot of playing time as he did not have the raw speed to become a blue chip linebacker. Plus the behavior of the football kids was simply terrible, many where already getting thrown in jail and it was a culture of disrespect.\n\nI told him he could be mediocre in both sports, but since he was 19 and 4 wrestling JV as a freshman w/out a lot of experience (did not wrestle in Junior high) he had more potential in wrestling. It was his decision 100% and he decided to quit football. He only went 500 his sophomore year wrestling varsity (he was making mistakes) but now that he us focusing 100% on wrestling he is doing well against the top kids. He got 2 out of 5 takedowns against a senior who went 2 and 2 at Fargo at the Purler camp yesterday. This summer he beat the #3 freestyle kid in the state.\n\nBut yes, wrestling is exploding in Texas because all the football coaches realize it improves their players tremendously.\n\n## Comment ID jru4nfk with +14 score by [(An_odd_kid, Reddit, 2023-07-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wrestling/comments/14yr2ex/many_great_wrestlers_from_places_like_russia_or/jru4nfk/) (in reply to ID 14yr2ex):\nWhy do you believe that most successful wrestlers from the Caucasus region start at age 14?

That means more people can train and improve at a much more steady pace over longer periods of time.

It is my understanding that they are paid well to compete at the highest level, where as in the US that is not usually the case. There's more money outside of competition.

Eastern young wrestlers learn gymnastics and tumbling before they ever start to wrestle while I have highschoolers who can barely do a cartwheel and have close to 100 matches under their belt. Do you think the Russian program just finds 14 year olds who have never wrestled, plucks them off the street and turns them into olympians?

That low population country dominates the winter Olympics over and over and over again.\n\nIn the U.S. in baseball for example, to get into the U.S. baseball system you must get a private coaching for kids as young as 6 or 7 and get them in a travel team well under age 10 or they become un-recruitable.  The U.S. is also obsessed with pedigree - if you are related to an older former player that made it to nationals, college, minors, etc. you are given an automatic leg up. \n\nU.S. sports focus on early youth and waste massive amounts of effort developing players before they even mature.  Players are funneled into particular sports before they are old enough to develop their own passion and interest for a topic.\n\nThere's no actual reason why a 14 year old who has never even played a sport before couldn't train up and compete in the Olympics.  But the U.S. system doesn't work this way.\n\nAnd while the U.S. system does produce some Olympic calibre talent by putting 4 year olds into a rigorous 10-year training program, we produce Olympic calibre competitors simply by putting massive numbers of kids into these extensive programs just to produce a tiny fractional % of Olympic contenders.\n\nSo I'd argue the U.S. system is not efficient.  Doesn't mean we don't get Olympic calibre contenders, but we don't produce them efficiently as a % of our player pool.\n\nWe do work hard and have good sports science programs to bleed the most out of contenders.  We also have good doping programs as a first world scientific country.  Russia got busted big time running that lab at Sochi but we've had plenty of athletes pop positive for banned substances.\n\n### Comment ID jryu4rp with +1 score by [(Dr_jitsu, Reddit, 2023-07-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wrestling/comments/14yr2ex/many_great_wrestlers_from_places_like_russia_or/jryu4rp/) (in reply to ID jrxznpi):\nInteresting post.\n\n## Comment ID jrtucao with +9 score by [(Puhgy, Reddit, 2023-07-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wrestling/comments/14yr2ex/many_great_wrestlers_from_places_like_russia_or/jrtucao/) (in reply to ID 14yr2ex):\nI love ice cream.\n\n### Comment ID jru59gr with +7 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-07-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wrestling/comments/14yr2ex/many_great_wrestlers_from_places_like_russia_or/jru59gr/) (in reply to ID jrtucao):\nCop out.\n\n## Comment ID jru7lw9 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-07-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wrestling/comments/14yr2ex/many_great_wrestlers_from_places_like_russia_or/jru7lw9/) (in reply to ID 14yr2ex):\nBecause it’s not as advantageous as you think to start kids really young\n\n## Comment ID jrudf6c with +1 score by [(lstills, Reddit, 2023-07-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wrestling/comments/14yr2ex/many_great_wrestlers_from_places_like_russia_or/jrudf6c/) (in reply to ID 14yr2ex):\nThis is so false, you don’t need titles in your sophomore year to go d1, but it also depends on your definition of D1.

Finalist and all-state is good too, but you can often walk onto d1 teams, though you may never wrestle in the lineup. You’ll be a d1 wrestler, just mostly a practice dummy.

You’re talking about places where people are riding bicycles over 45 minutes for access to a barbell for strength training. I bet many of these athletes plan to wrestle but can’t or don’t until High School.\n\nConversely, sports in the USA are insanely competitive at the youth level because of parental support systems and community networks that allow kids to become so advanced in different areas that they hold a massive edge over newcomers. The area in PA that I come from is absolutely dominant at the HS level and produces more D1 wrestlers than almost any area in the nation. These guys fill out college rosters for the most part, and only the special athletes make noise nationally and never as many as you’d think. The competition catches up and passes them in college. Locally however, they beat better athletes throughout high school.\n\nSampling is almost certainly an issue as well. Taking into context the information above you can probably guess that youth participation data is way more readily available here than in other countries. For context my U14 basketball career is more well chronicled online than Giannis and Nikola Jokic even though I’m sure they played at that age and I didn’t even go on to play in High School.\n\nI’d bet there were 12 year old Americans with more wrestling results data available online than the guy who smoked Kyle Dake in the Olympics and took Silver.\n\n## Comment ID jrva6ie with +1 score by [(NicNack8, Reddit, 2023-07-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wrestling/comments/14yr2ex/many_great_wrestlers_from_places_like_russia_or/jrva6ie/) (in reply to ID 14yr2ex):\nLee Kemp started in high school and was a 3-time world champion it can happen in the American system it's just rare just like it is in Russia or Iran I think this post presupposes that foreign systems produce more late bloomers when that isn't necessarily true.\n\n## Comment ID jrvc8x3 with +1 score by [(Gr3nwr35stlr, Reddit, 2023-07-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wrestling/comments/14yr2ex/many_great_wrestlers_from_places_like_russia_or/jrvc8x3/) (in reply to ID 14yr2ex):\n100% disagree with the statement that you need to be winning titles from freshmen/sophomore year to go D1.

They were saying that Eastern European training/practice is a lot more playful and flowing and eventually leads into short bouts of the hard stuff.  That allowed them to stay on the mat longer without injury developing technical skill.  It also made them physically more resilient as their bodies had time to adapt.\n\nThis is an interesting topic because another historically American sport, Boxing, has a very similar profile.  Start by age 7 or there is no chance to become Ali, Jones, or Mayweather Jr.  Those guys had abnormal physical gifts where I noticed so many athletically Average Joe Eastern European fighters that competed at a high level due to being very well balanced in all areas.\n\n### Comment ID jrvwi05 with +1 score by [(Dr_jitsu, Reddit, 2023-07-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wrestling/comments/14yr2ex/many_great_wrestlers_from_places_like_russia_or/jrvwi05/) (in reply to ID jrvi0ch):\nHaving boxed...and done so in a New York Ghetto area (Upstate NY, Albany, and with some of the D'Amatto guys) I think it takes less time to become really proficient at boxing.\n\n#### Comment ID jrwqk41 with +2 score by [(dallast313, Reddit, 2023-07-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wrestling/comments/14yr2ex/many_great_wrestlers_from_places_like_russia_or/jrwqk41/) (in reply to ID jrvwi05):\nTo become \"proficient\"?  I agree.  Boxing is a more limited skill set. Boxing also has far fewer answers if a guy isn't \"enough\" in a certain department.  \n\nI was speaking of the possibility to become \"great\" later in life as per the original post. Agreeing with your original observation, I noticed that most US Boxing \"greats\" tend to have been introduced to Boxing extremely early.  Scary early given the objective and inevitable brain consequence of the sport. As you probably know, big strong athletic ex-football players switching over to Boxing later in life are kind of a running joke in the Boxing community.  On paper they would seem to have the capability, but...  Guys coming to Boxing late in life seem to have a ceiling on development unless they have almost insane attribute combinations, e.g, Deontay Wilder.\n\nMy theory is the uniquely American approach to physical endeavors of harder=good versus what I would extrapolate based on the video I watched consistency=good.  This social concept bleeds into US youth sports. Train hard from youth and those that make it are almost unstoppable, but you lose depth and breadth of talent. Contrast that with train lighter, longer, and in a more playful way-of-life way.  It allows for larger programs that find/develop special talent over time.  This allows youth that come to the sport late to blossom versus getting ground to dust and pushed out due to the intensity level of the program.  The state sponsorship allowing for consistency in training standards and facilities helps as well, but I believe is a contributing not deciding factor.  I site Cuba as evidence of that.  Poor facilities, but high output of fundamentally sound practitioners.\n\n## Comment ID jrvnfz4 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-07-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wrestling/comments/14yr2ex/many_great_wrestlers_from_places_like_russia_or/jrvnfz4/) (in reply to ID 14yr2ex):\nRussians train by wrestling wild bears.

I've met a handful of national-level Russian wrestlers, and all of them have been wrestling basically since they could walk.\n\nAlso, there could be a bit of a different understanding about what it means to \"start\" wrestling. I can't speak to Iran, but Russia somewhat maintained the USSR's sport infrastructure, with special \"sports schools\" which promising athletes start attending around the age of 13-14. These are basically boarding schools where the kids are only training in their sport and maybe an hour or two of anything academic. \n\nCompare that to the US, where there is at least lip service done to giving student-athletes some amount of non-sport education.\n\nEven supposing that a Russian wrestler and US wrestler both \"started\" wrestling at an elite school around the age of 14, by they time they are 18, there could already be a huge difference in mat-time.\n\nJust one factor to consider. As others have mentioned, there is a different idea about managing training intensity between the US and Russia wrestling programs, with some research indicating that US wrestlers sustain more career-ending injuries. Removing athletes from the talent pool for any reason is going to hurt a program.\n\n### Comment ID jrwj5l4 with +1 score by [(Dr_jitsu, Reddit, 2023-07-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wrestling/comments/14yr2ex/many_great_wrestlers_from_places_like_russia_or/jrwj5l4/) (in reply to ID jrwgs59):\nI posted 1 excellent academic study that put the age at 10-11, and another explaining why 10 and I also have tons of anecdotal evidence.

Maybe \"supplements\" too. They handpick kids at a young age. We have nothing like that. Your school has wrestling and for whatever reason you decide to step on the mat. It is getting better but quite a few US coaches fail to condition their kids correctly and miss many fine points. We had olympians practicing with us in high school and that made a big difference, but our main coach was still the man. He was a very basic wrestler and there were so many things he did not prioritize. I believe russian and iranian coaches are pros, not picking up extra money."

      "# [Top 5 Data Lineage Tools (+ How to Choose)](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-lineage-tools)\nThe good news is that business leaders and stakeholders are increasingly seeing the value of data lineage in their organizations. The even better news is that the data lineage tool market offers more options for data teams every year.\n\nAs a whole, the global data catalog market is projected to grow from $878.8 million in 2023 to $4,680.9 million by 2032, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.7% during this period. That’s respectable.\n\nSo, as more data teams enter the market for lineage tools, it’s important to distinguish the apples from the oranges. Much like data lineage itself, knowledge is power when it comes to vetting potential lineage tools.\n\nThat's why we’re showcasing five potentially potent tools for data lineage here, noting the pros, cons, and pricing for each.\n\nData lineage tools: 5 worth considering\n\nGable.ai\n\nGable is a pioneering data contracts platform that's proactively bridging the gap between data producers and consumers. It focuses on proactive data quality management (i.e., shifting data quality left) by implementing data contracts early in the data lifecycle. In doing so, Gable allows teams to draft, define, and enforce data contracts, providing a collaborative environment for software developers, data engineers, and data scientists.\n\nWhile not a traditional data lineage tool, Gable's approach to data contracts offers a unique perspective on lineage. By defining and versioning data contracts, it provides visibility into data origins, transformations, and dependencies, effectively creating a proactive form of lineage tracking that starts at the source of data creation.\n\nPros:\n\nOffers a highly proactive approach to data quality\n\nUniquely able to integrate directly into development workflows\n\nCan also reduce costs and wasted effort by maintaining data integrity early in the process\n\nCons:\n\nAs a relative newcomer, Gable.ai may present a bit of a learning curve compared to other tools listed\n\nPricing: Interested parties should sign up to Gable’s product waitlist to learn more as details become available.\n\nAlation\n\nAlation is a comprehensive data intelligence platform that offers robust data lineage capabilities. It provides automatic table and column-level lineage, along with business lineage featuring metadata overlays. Alation's strength as a lineage tool lies in its advanced visualization capabilities—including end-to-end mini-map previews and data flow filtering.\n\nTogether, these features allow users to trace data from its origin through various transformations to its final use, providing crucial insights for data governance, impact analysis, and regulatory compliance. Alation's lineage capabilities are especially valuable for organizations dealing with complex data ecosystems, as they offer a clear, visual representation of data flows across multiple systems and processes.\n\nPros:\n\nA comprehensive data intelligence solution\n\nOffers advanced visualization capabilities\n\nIntegrates with many data sources\n\nCons:\n\nCan be complex to implement and use\n\nMay also be overkill for organizations with simpler needs\n\n‍\n\nPricing: Alation doesn't publicly disclose pricing. Those interested need to contact sales for a custom quote.\n\nSecoda\n\nSecoda bills itself as a data discovery and documentation platform that emphasizes user-friendliness and automation in its data lineage features. It offers automated data lineage capture and visualization, integrating with a variety of data sources and tools to provide a comprehensive view of data flows.\n\nAs a lineage tool, Secoda stands out for its ability to automatically generate and maintain up-to-date lineage information with a minimal amount of manual input. Its column-level lineage capabilities allow for granular tracking of data transformations, making it easier for organizations to understand data dependencies, troubleshoot issues, and assess the impact of changes across their data ecosystem.\n\nPros:\n\nProvides a user-friendly interface\n\nOffers strong integration capabilities\n\nLineage capture can be automated\n\nCons:\n\nAdvanced features may necessitate a learning curve for some\n\nLike Gable.ai, Scoda is a relatively new player in the market\n\nPricing: At this time Secoda doesn't publicly share pricing information. Curious parties will need to contact sales for a quote.\n\nCollibra\n\nCollibra is a solid data intelligence platform offering a suite of tools for data governance, cataloging, and lineage. Its data lineage capabilities, specifically, provide end-to-end lineage mapping with technical lineage at table, column, and transformation levels.\n\nViewed solely as a lineage tool, Collibra provides data teams with a comprehensive view of data flows across an organization. Its interactive lineage diagrams offer intuitive visual representations of complex data relationships, enabling users to easily trace data origins, understand transformations, and assess the impact of changes.\n\nThis makes Collibra particularly valuable for organizations that need to prioritize data governance, regulatory compliance, and maintain an in-depth understanding of their data landscape.\n\nPros:\n\nViewed as a comprehensive data governance solution\n\nOffers strong data lineage visualization capabilities\n\nVery robust metadata management\n\nCons:\n\nCan be expensive for smaller organizations\n\nComes with a comparatively complex implementation process\n\nPricing: Collibra offers yearly licensing subscriptions:\n\n12-month plan: $170,000\n\n24-month plan: $340,000\n\n36-month plan: $510,000\n\nDbt (data build tool)\n\nKnown primarily as a data transformation tool, dbt does data lineage capabilities. However, said capabilities are more limited compared to other tools featured above. It provides table-level lineage within dbt projects, with column-level lineage available in the dbt Cloud Enterprise tier.\n\nTherefore, when viewed as a potential lineage tool, dbt's strength lies in its native integration with data transformation processes.\n\nDbt does visualize dependencies between models, which helps data teams understand how changes in one part of a data pipeline might affect others.\n\nIts lineage features are more focused on assets managed within dbt projects—making this integration of particular value for organizations already using dbt, as it provides immediate insights into the lineage of transformed data without the need for additional tools.\n\nPros:\n\nNative integration with data transformation processes\n\nOpen-source core with active community\n\nVisualizes dependencies between models\n\nCons:\n\nLimited to dbt-managed assets\n\nFull column-level lineage only available in its Enterprise tier\n\nPricing: dbt offers three subscription tiers:\n\nCore: Free and open-source\n\nCloud Team: Starts at $50 per user per month\n\nCloud Enterprise: Custom pricing, make inquiries to dbt’s sales team\n\nWhy are data lineage tools important?\n\nAs a refresher, know that data lineage tools should increasingly be seen as table-stakes for modern organizations to establish (and reap the multitude of rewards from) robust data governance and management practices.\n\nIt’s these tools that provide the features and functionality that make fostering and maintaining pristine data quality possible.\n\nEnhanced data transparency and visibility\n\nData lineage tools provide a clear and real-time view of how data flows across an organization, enabling stakeholders to gain deeper insights into data usage, dependencies, and transformations.\n\nOft-overlooked, this transparency also contributes to a culture of impactful data-driven decision-making.\n\nImproved data quality and accuracy\n\nAutomated data lineage tools help identify data quality issues by highlighting anomalies, transformations, and potential errors in the lineage. This early detection allows data teams, stewards, and scientists to address issues promptly, ensuring data remains accurate and reliable.\n\nEfficient compliance and auditing\n\nData lineage is essential for regulatory compliance, especially in industries with strict and/or complex data regulations. These tools provide an audit trail demonstrating how data is used and processed, facilitating compliance reporting and audits.\n\nStreamlined data governance\n\nData lineage simplifies data governance by providing a clear understanding of data assets, their ownership, and the impact of made changes. As a result, lineage tools make it easier to enforce data policies and maintain optimal data quality.\n\nFaster troubleshooting and issue resolution\n\nWhen data issues arise, lineage tools enable faster troubleshooting by allowing data professionals to trace problems back to their source, identify root causes, and implement solutions as quickly as possible.\n\nEnhanced data security\n\nData lineage helps organizations identify vulnerabilities in their data pipelines and access controls, allowing for the implementation of robust security measures to safeguard sensitive information.\n\nEffective change management\n\nBy visualizing how data flows are impacted by changes, teams can assess potential risks and make informed decisions during system upgrades or process modifications.\n\nSupport for data-driven decision making\n\nData lineage empowers more people (both data professionals and their data-adjacent peers) to understand and leverage data assets, supporting true data democratization and enabling more informed decision-making throughout the organization.\n\nOperational efficiency\n\nBy automating data mapping and reducing the need for manual impact analysis, data lineage tools can save significant time and resources, enhancing overall operational efficiency.\n\nRisk management\n\nData lineage manages risks associated with data usage, transformations, and access by providing a comprehensive view of data flow and dependencies.\n\nHow to choose the right data lineage tool\n\nSituations, organizational needs, technical capabilities, and lineage tools themselves are all always in flux—so there will never be a one “best” way to go about choosing the right data lineage tool.\n\nThat said, by carefully considering the following factors and aligning them with your organization's specific requirements, you can streamline to process of learning about and comparing tools, ensuring the chosen tool provides the most value and the best fit possible:\n\nDetermine scope and depth of lineage tracking: Look for tools that provide comprehensive lineage at multiple levels—table, column, and row-level lineage. Ensure the tool captures lineage across your entire data ecosystem, not just from limited sources like BI tools.\n\nReview integration capabilities: The tool should integrate well with your existing data stack, including data warehouses, ETL/ELT tools, BI platforms, etc. Check the depth of integrations—some tools may claim to integrate with a platform but only offer surface-level connectivity.\n\nCompare visualization and analysis features: Clear, intuitive visualizations of data lineage are crucial for understanding complex data flows. Look for capabilities like impact analysis, data flow mapping, and the ability to trace data upstream and downstream.\n\nDetermine if automation and metadata collection is necessary: Automated lineage capture reduces manual effort and improves accuracy. The tool should be able to automatically collect and update metadata as your data environment changes.\n\nVet each tool’s ability to scale: Ensure the tool can handle your current data volume and complexity, as well as scale as your data ecosystem grows.\n\nConsider usability and accessibility: The tool should be user-friendly for both technical and non-technical team members. Features like search functionality and collaborative capabilities are valuable.\n\nInquire about compliance and governance support: If regulatory compliance is a concern, look for tools that offer features to support data governance and compliance efforts.\n\nAsses potential performance impact: Consider how the lineage tool might affect the performance of your data systems, especially for large-scale implementations.\n\nWeigh cost against potential ROI: Evaluate the pricing model and ensure it aligns with your budget and expected value from implementing data lineage.\n\nPrioritize future-proofing: Choose a tool that can adapt to evolving data architectures and technologies.\n\nGet a sense of each tool’s support and community: Consider the level of support provided by the vendor and the existence of an active user community for knowledge sharing.\n\nDetermine if complementary features are available: Some tools offer additional features like data quality monitoring or data cataloging that may provide added value.\n\nLooking to shift your lineage left?\n\nAgain, the right data lineage tools can dramatically enhance data governance, transparency, and quality within your organization. But it should now be crystal clear that choosing the right solution is crucial. Whether you're looking to streamline compliance, ensure data accuracy, or improve decision-making, having the right tool in your data stack is non-negotiable.\n\nGable.ai goes beyond traditional lineage solutions by introducing proactive data contracts, which tackle data quality at the source. By implementing Gable.ai's innovative approach, you’ll be setting your team up for long-term success, maintaining data integrity, and reducing costly errors early in the process.\n\nTo learn more about how Gable.ai can empower your organization with next-level data contracts and improve your overall data management strategy, sign up for our product waitlist today.\n\n‍",

      "# [GABLE delivers all-time high income, ready to propel businesses towards the AI FIRST era with the strategy of “Sustain = Smart + Secure.”](https://www.g-able.com/insights/g-able-enable-the-future)\nG-Able Public Company Limited, a leading \"Tech Enabler\" that helps businesses embrace every aspect of the digital era, has revealed its 2024 business strategy, focusing on developing digital solutions and capabilities while enhancing businesses' readiness to address various challenges on the path to becoming AI-ready organizations. GABLE plans to expand its Business Application segment through global HCM partnerships, offering full-suite digital solutions across five portfolios to meet business needs. This expansion aligns with the core strategy of \"Sustain = Smart + Secure,\" enabling clients’ businesses to navigate the AI-First era towards sustainable success.\n\nDr. Chaiyuth Chunnahacha, CEO of G-Able Public Company Limited, stated, “As a SET-listed digital tech giant equipped with technologies and capital, our main aim is to tap into our modern and smart technologies and digital solutions to serve future business needs, secure organizational data, increase profitability, and ensure sustainable growth of our clients in the AI-First era, in alignment with the strategy of 'Sustain = Smart + Secure.'”\n\nIn 2023, GABLE achieved huge success in its initial public offering and SET-listing as G-Able Public Company Limited. This has enhanced its readiness in terms of its capital for investment in its capacity and capabilities in line with its plan to drive strong and sustainable growth. GABLE’s own software platform has served as a key growth engine propelling the Group’s solid business expansion across many segments. The five affiliated companies have been key in generating the Group’s income, using its Value-Added Distribution to further its growth. The Group’s recurring income exceeded one half of the total income, and its backlog portion climbed up to an unprecedented level of over Baht 4.5 billion.\n\nWith its extensive experience of over 35 years in helping businesses gain a competitive edge through technologies, GABLE has seen opportunities to steer its growth by capitalizing on the AI trend that plays an increasingly important role in organizations. All businesses need to develop their systems to become AI-ready organizations. In doing so, Cloud-based IT infrastructures, data analytics systems through big data platforms, and 24-hour cybersecurity systems should be established to ensure that front-office and back-office systems are ready to work synchronously with AI in the future.\n\nApart from the AI trend that is bringing more growth opportunities for GABLE, building ‘Smart Organizations’ through business applications such as human capital management software is another key growth driver because one crucial asset of an organization is “human.” According to Gartner, the HCM market is expected to see an average growth rate over the next three years at 18%. As organizations need to improve their competitiveness through building up a pool of talents, software platforms can help them do so through the use of big data and AI in talent analytics, skill management, and productivity and efficiency enhancement of employees across sections.\n\nGABLE’s 2024 strategy is originated from the adoption of the concept of “Smart + Secure” to ensure clients’ business sustainability. This consists of the following 3 main guidelines: To integrate GABLE’s Enterprise Solutions and Services core business comprising 5 portfolios, namely Data Analytics, Cloud, Cybersecurity, Application Development, and Managed Tech Services, with its IP platforms to support the preparation of AI-ready data and AI-ready security, as higher demands\n\nfor AI and cybersecurity will boost GABLE’s growth.\n\nTo expand the Group’s capabilities through potential business applications in HCM and ERP through partnering with global entities with expertise across various fields and selecting other interesting smart business applications to provide continued support for its clients. To focus on investment in businesses that are aligned with GABLE’s business concept to secure\n\nmore opportunities and satisfying rates of return; and to gain competitive edge by using its funds from its IPO worth around Baht 600 million to propel business growth under the investment framework covering three main areas: Right Product, Right Technology; Win-Win business Synergy; and Right Price, Right Value.\n\nMs. Raveeratana Satchavarodom, Chief Finance & Strategy Officer of G-Able Public Company Limited stated that in 2023, GABLE’s operating income reached Baht 5,338 million, 13% up from 2022. Despite external factors and fluctuations at macro and industrial levels leading to stronger competition, GABLE was able to navigate these challenges, achieving steadfast expansion and double-digit growth rates in income across all segments, including Enterprise Solution, Valued Added Distribution, and Software Platform, from its clients.\n\nMoreover, after its IPO, GABLE was able to generate a gross profit of Baht 1,099 million in 2023, growing 10% year-on-year, or a gross profit margin of 21%, about the same level as last year. GABLE’s net profit for 2023 stayed at Baht 253 million, and the backlog portion reached an all-time high at Baht 4,544 million, up 16% from Q3 of 2023, ready to support future income recognition. The backlog level is set to support future income generation in 2024 of over Baht 2,753 million, accounting for nearly one-half of the target income in 2024. Furthermore, the Company’s opportunities to further grow its business come from\n\nthe accelerated demand for the creation of AI-ready organizations, the need to set up data analytics and cybersecurity, its partnerships in developing business applications, and inorganic investment through M&As.\n\nBy adopting the strategy of “Sustain = Smart + Secure,” in 2024 GABLE will continue to operate its business based on the 3 guidelines, namely Smart Finance, Secure Finance, and Sustain Finance. Smart Finance is to create more financial returns from organic investment and inorganic investment. Secure Finance is to maintain financial discipline through secure operations and secure investment, focusing on sustainable investment within the so-called Investment Framework to ensure secure and sustainable business growth in the long term. And Sustain Finance is to establish sustainable financial growth, including mitigating risks to be within acceptable levels.\n\nThe above strategy will lead to GABLE’s growing backlog and its move towards reaching another all-time high this year at around Baht 4.5-5.5 billion. GABLE will expectedly continue to maintain its gross profit margin at 20-22% with its recurring income of more than 50% of the total income, to support risk management for investors. With its sound financial discipline and available capital of more than Baht 600 million from the IPO along with its capacity and capabilities, GABLE is ready to grow further in line with the upcoming trend in 2024.",

The gables in Classical Greek temples are called pediments.\n\nThe architectural treatment of a gable results from the effort to find an aesthetically pleasing solution to the problem of keeping water out of the intersection of walls and roof. This is accomplished either by carrying the roof out over the top of the end walls or by carrying the end walls up above the roof level and capping them with a waterproof coping. The former method is in general use in wooden and other small buildings with pitched roofs, while the latter method is used in larger and more monumental masonry structures, particularly those in the Gothic style.",
      "# [Gable Steveson returns to wrestle for the Gophers two years after leaving the program by Randy Johnson on 2024-11-12](https://www.startribune.com/gable-steveson-returns-gophers-wrestling-ncaa/601179702)\nSteveson, 24, still had one year of eligibility remaining when he retired from collegiate wrestling after winning his second consecutive NCAA championship in 2022. He’s expected to make his season debut on Nov. 24 against Campbell at Maturi Pavilion.\n\n“First, I would like to thank the University of Minnesota for their time, their effort and their persistence with me to push me to the man I am today,” Steveson said in a comeback video. “Minnesota has given me everything, and now it’s my turn to give it right back to them: to put my feet back on the wrestling mat, to be the champ, one more time.”\n\nThe two-time Hodge Trophy winner as the nation’s top collegiate wrestler, Steveson opted to begin a pro wrestling career with WWE following his gold medal win in Tokyo. The organization allowed him to continue wrestling collegiately, and he returned to the Gophers to win his second NCAA title in 2022. After the NCAA championship match, he removed his shoes and placed them in the center of the mat, the signal of a wrestler’s retirement.\n\nEven when he was with WWE, Steveson continued to train with the Gopher Wrestling Club, and he won the 2023 U.S. Open Wrestling Championships, as well as Final X, clinching a spot on the U.S. Senior Team ahead of the 2023 World Championships. He did not compete in the world event and didn’t participate in the 2024 Olympic trials because of his WWE obligations.\n\n“Gable has the burning desire to compete for the Maroon and Gold one last time,” Eggum said in a statement. “We are thankful he has chosen the opportunity to add to his historic legacy with our program. He is one of the best to ever compete in the sport of wrestling, and we are grateful for the impact he has had at our program.”\n\nWhen Steveson returns to the mat, he’ll become the favorite to win his third NCAA championship and will bolster Minnesota’s lineup. The Gophers were eighth in the Intermatwrestle.com dual-meet rankings and tied for 11th in the tournament rankings before Steveson announced he was coming back.\n\nSteveson’s return also potentially sets up a Minnesota vs. Minnesota battle for NCAA heavyweight supremacy. The reigning heavyweight national champion is Penn State senior Greg Kerkvliet, the former Simley High School standout from Inver Grove Heights who went 20-0 last season on his way to his first NCAA crown. Kerkvliet finished seventh as a freshman in 2021, fourth in 2022 and runner-up in 2023. Steveson beat Kerkvliet 9-4 in the 2021 NCAA quarterfinals and 8-3 in the 2022 NCAA semifinals.\n\nSteveson has an 85-2 career collegiate record and an active 52-match winning streak. He hasn’t lost since falling 4-3 in the 2019 NCAA semifinals to Penn State’s Anthony Cassar. After a 15-0 record and the first of three Big Ten titles in 2020, Steveson was aiming to win his first NCAA title at U.S. Bank Stadium, but the national meet was called off because of COVID-19.\n\nAfter capping a 17-0 season in 2021 with his first NCAA crown, Steveson turned his attention to the Olympics. He brought home gold from Tokyo with an amazing comeback against Georgia’s Geno Petriashvili. Trailing 8-5, Steveson got two takedowns in the final 10 seconds — the last with 0.2 left on the clock — to stun the three-time world champion.\n\nSteveson never gained the professional popularity that WWE was hoping for, and the organization released him from his contract in May. The Apple Valley native gave football a try, spending training camp with the Buffalo Bills as a defensive lineman even though he hadn’t played the sport as a youth.",

      "# [Gable youngest elected to NCGA in 126 years by A.P. Dillon on 2024-11-21](https://nsjonline.com/article/2024/11/gable-youngest-elected-to-ncga-in-126-years/)\nRALEIGH — Newly elected 22-year-old Rep. Wyatt Gable will be the youngest and first Gen Z member elected to the General Assembly House in modern history.\n\nClyde R. Hoey, North Carolina’s 59th governor, was 21 when he was first elected to the N.C. House of Representatives 126 years ago and served from 1898-1902.\n\n“It feels awesome,” Gable told North State Journal of becoming the youngest member of the General Assembly. “It’s a little weird just thinking how many people have been in the General Assembly in North Carolina, that I’ll be the youngest one, but I am looking forward to it.”\n\nGable was elected with more than 66% of the vote to the House District 14 seat, which covers all of Onslow County.\n\nGable defeated Democrat Carmen Spicer by more than 8,100 votes and won in all nine precincts.\n\nGable said that while his district trends Republican, his team didn’t take that for granted and had knocked on more than 500 doors this election cycle as well as running ads on social media platforms and contacting voters through text messaging.\n\nDuring his campaign, Gable ran as a “staunch conservative that will always stand up for your rights in the N.C. House.”\n\nGable said the COVID-19 pandemic is what spurred him to run for office.\n\n“I just think kind of back in high school and college with the COVID itself, it really felt like no one at any level of government was really interested in trying and helping people, and I just kind of remember how that felt,” said Gable. “So I just want to make sure that no one felt the same way I did.”\n\nGable said he decided to run for the legislature because it had a broader reach, covered a wider range of issues, and he felt he could make the biggest impact there.\n\nIn the March primary, Gable stunned 10-term incumbent Republican Rep. George Cleveland by just 95 votes.\n\nGable, an only child, is a senior at East Carolina University and began his pursuit of the Onslow seat as a junior. He is studying business management at ECU with a minor in political science. Additionally, Gable has been an attendee and graduate of the Leadership Institute’s Youth Leadership School.\n\nThe next session of the legislature in 2025 will overlap with Gable’s final semester at ECU, but Gable said school officials had been “very helpful” on how to make it work.\n\n“In the first part of January, we’ll get a lot of work done here at school, so then the rest of the semester can be as easy as possible,” Gable said. “But luckily, it’s not that far to drive either from Greenville to Raleigh. We’ll make it through those first few months and do the best job we can.”\n\nWhen asked about his main priorities heading into his first term, Gable said jobs and infrastructure.\n\n“Specific to Onslow, definitely trying to increase the amount of jobs that we can bring to the county,” he said. “And then on top of that, the infrastructure we have and trying to improve that because we have a massive population influx right now and just making sure that people have jobs and, again, the infrastructure to hold all of them.\n\n“And then on top of that, with more jobs, we have Camp Lejeune. You might have the skilled workers that live on the base and work for the Marine Corps., but their family members don’t really have a whole lot of job options. So making sure that they have something to do is another.”\n\nA Jacksonville resident of 15 years, Gable graduated from White Oak High School in 2021. He is a past president of the ECU chapter of Turning Point USA, a nonprofit that advocates for conservative causes. In his free time, Gable has a passion for paintball and has traveled around the state playing in various tournaments and events.",
