      "# [What is DataOps? What Leaders Need to Know](https://www.gable.ai/blog/dataops)\nSomething interesting is taking place in the world of DataOps right now. A big something. But what’s really interesting is what’s at play behind the scenes.\n\nAccording to our friends at Global Market Insights (GMI), the calculated annual growth rate (CAGR) of the DataOps platform marketplace is projected to grow 22% from 2023 to 2032 (i.e., less than one decade). By comparison, this is potentially 1% more than the much-buzzed-about low-code application marketplace is projected to grow during the same time.\n\nHowever, the factors driving DataOps aren’t quite as clear compared to low-code.\n\nData orchestration capabilities need to keep pace with the growing volume and complexity of Big Data, and this is part of the reason for this exceptional amount of growth. Improving customer service and experience, increasing operational efficiency, and maintaining competitive advantages are ongoing priorities for businesses.\n\nHowever, this near-exponential investment in DataOps may be due to a reckoning between two other causal trends—the increasing business need for real-time data insights and the growing impact of data governance and compliance globally.\n\nTo better understand why, let’s start by breaking down DataOps, covering its core principles, best practices, and implementation challenges within modern organizations.\n\nA basic definition of DataOps\n\nFor those who work in leadership or data-adjacent teams, DataOps is a lot like shifted paradigms—no doubt you’ve heard it mentioned while doing business. However, lacking any direct experience, what exactly DataOps is may be less than clear. Let’s correct this now.\n\nDataOps is short for Data Operations. It is a process-oriented methodology that shares and builds on many characteristics of Agile methodologies, DevOps, and lean manufacturing. Simply, the goal of DataOps is to reduce the cycle time of data analytics. In practice, it does so by streamlining collection from data sources to consumption by data consumers.\n\nBroadly speaking, the DataOps process is driven through an organized emphasis on automation, collaboration, and communication. For good reason, this means DataOps and DevOps cross streams quite often in practice. Both are instrumental in keeping Big Data and business value from being at odds.\n\nWe’ve done our best to compare and contrast both processes elsewhere. But know that exploring the core pillars of DataOps helps clarify the distinct role it plays.\n\nCore principles of modern DataOps\n\nAndy Palmer coined the term \"DataOps\" in 2015, describing it as the intersection of data engineering, data quality, and data integration with a focus on various data professionals in a given organization communicating and collaborating to increase the velocity, reliability, and quality of data analytics.\n\nWhile the concept and practice of DataOps has evolved and expanded beyond Palmer’s definition the core principles that enable professionals to put DataOps into practice remain largely the same:\n\n1. Automation and Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)\n\nThe beating heart of DataOps is automation, which aims to reduce manual efforts related to data validation, integration, and deployment processes.\n\nThis often includes automating data ingestion, testing, monitoring, and deployment within a build/deployment pipeline to ensure both consistency and reliability.\n\n2. Agile and lean methodologies\n\nPractitioners work to streamline data management processes by incorporating agile and lean methodologies.\n\nAgile’s focus on flexibility, continuous improvement, and the delivery of high-quality products in short cycles enables data teams to accelerate experimentation and adaptation based on feedback. Lean methodologies, in turn, guide teams to streamline data pipelines, minimize inefficiencies, and ensure that data delivery remains firmly coupled to business needs.\n\n3. Collaboration and alignment\n\nEffective DataOps encourages a culture of collaboration and alignment among cross-functional teams, which typically includes data engineers, scientists, and business stakeholders.\n\nFostering collaboration in this fashion ensures data products align with business needs and that data analysts can deliver all insights efficiently.\n\n4. Cloud-first and scalable infrastructure\n\nModern DataOps ecosystems should prioritize cloud-based solutions for optimal scalability and flexibility.\n\nThis principle specifically supports distributed data processing and storage, enabling organizations to scale data operations as needed.\n\n5. Highly automated and continuous processes\n\nDataOps ecosystems should feature high levels of automation to manage the scale and scope of enterprise data efficiently and effectively.\n\nIn practice, this often includes automating the cataloging, movement, and organization of data, in addition to testing and releasing processes.\n\n6. Openness and interoperability\n\nAn ecosystem in which DevOps practitioners leverage best-in-class, open-source, and potentially free tools is essential for innovation. The inverse also holds true—DataOps practitioners should avoid reliance on single, proprietary platforms (as opposed to a variety of tools that are easy to integrate and replace).\n\nThis ease of integration should also apply to a broad spectrum of potential data sources (e.g., data lakes, data warehouses) to improve data quality and governance.\n\n7. Data quality and governance\n\nImplementing robust data governance guidelines and practices is essential to ensure high data quality.\n\nAt a minimum, governance should involve data validation, cleaning, and reconciliation processes which can ensure accuracy and reliability throughout the data lifecycle.\n\n8. Ephemeral environments and code reuse\n\nEphemeral environments are temporary by nature, so using them for testing further enhances flexibility and accelerates development. As such, they reduce the risk of conflicts between environments while promoting resource efficiency.\n\nCode reuse helps practitioners maintain consistency, reduce errors, and save time by avoiding duplications of effort. Additionally, containerization encapsulates applications and their dependencies into containers that can run reliably in different computing environments.\n\n9. Monitoring, observability, and customer centricity\n\nDataOps practitioners should prioritize continuous monitoring and observability of data pipelines, ensuring data availability, performance, and security. This is vital for identifying, addressing, and resolving issues as quickly as possible.\n\nWhile DataOps practitioners focus on reducing cycle times for data delivery, enabling faster insights, and improving data-driven decision-making, ultimately everything done must remain rooted in delivering value to the organization’s end-users and customers.\n\nBeing such an elemental aspect of any data practice, it’s also beneficial to explore how other data leaders articulate their core principles of DataOps. For an excellent perspective to which we can compare and contrast the above, we recommend looking at DataKitchen’s seminal DataOps Cookbook (that is, after finishing our own article, here, of course).\n\nDataOps best practices\n\nIf core principles are one side of the DataOps coin, best practices are the other. Without them, no amount of core principles would allow organizations to actively streamline their data management processes, accelerate their insight generation, and (perhaps most fundamentally) improve data quality.\n\nBecause of this, DataOps best practices naturally intertwine with the principles outlined above. But the key best practices are still worth detailing, as they are applicable across industries and organizations:\n\nFoster a collaborative culture\n\nThe existence of departmental silos within organizations is understandable. But they aren’t acceptable. This is why DataOps best practices begin by breaking down obstacles and fostering communication and collaboration between teams—data engineers, data scientists, business users, stakeholders, and operations.\n\nDataOps makes data quality and accessibility a shared responsibility across an organization, which, in turn, sets the stage for all best practices that follow.\n\nAdopt a customer-centric approach\n\nToo often, adopting a customer-centric approach emerges as an afterthought in the practice of DataOps. This borders on being a tragic irony, as the benefits of DataOps itself—enhanced value delivery, promoting agility and responsiveness, driving innovation, fueling trust and loyalty, etc.—can only be fully realized by engaging with end-users to understand their needs, challenges, and desires.\n\nImplement agile methodologies\n\nLook to agile practices like sprints and scrums to manage data projects, allowing for rapid iteration and responses to change. Practitioners can also use Agile approaches to prioritize work based on business needs and value.\n\nHowever, it bears noting that when practitioners seek to leverage Agile as a DataOps best practice, they must ensure its impact is balanced and holistic within the organization. When employed dogmatically, these Agile methodologies can muddle the practice of proper documentation, over-complicate data management, erode data quality for the sake of responsiveness, and potentially introduce security and compliance risks.\n\nFor these reasons, make sure that Agile within your organization is used as part of the overall DataOps solution, not a solution unto itself.\n\nAutomate data pipelines\n\nActively implement CI/CD pipelines in order to automate data integration, testing, deployment, and monitoring processes. In addition to this best practice of reducing manual efforts and errors, CI/CD pipelines help ensure seamless, automated updates and deployments.\n\nEmbrace continuous testing\n\nLeverage automation to test data quality, data integration, and performance throughout the organization’s data lifecycle.\n\nFurthermore, test-driven development (TDD) approaches should be adopted for data-related code and pipelines. TDD encourages earlier issue identification and potential integration issues while contributing to overall data quality.\n\nMake version control ubiquitous\n\nTrack changes and facilitate collaboration by utilizing version control for all data assets—code, configurations, and data modeling, to name a few.\n\nAdditionally, data versioning strategies should be considered to manage changes in datasets. Doing so enables reproducibility and replicability, supports the experimentation and iteration that DataOps champions, and allows organizations to demonstrate the lineage and provenance of their data.\n\nObsessively monitor data quality and performance\n\nThe ability to identify and solution for issues quickly requires the continuous monitoring of pipeline performance and data quality.\n\nEstablishing key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics related to quality is itself key for operationalizing effective monitoring capabilities.\n\nEnsure data security and compliance\n\nData security, privacy, and compliance checks should be embedded through data pipelines to protect sensitive information while helping the organization comply with all relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).\n\nThese compliance checks also require regular reviews, and security practices must be updated to keep pace with ever-evolving threats and regulations.\n\nInvest in scalable and flexible infrastructure\n\nUtilize cloud services and technologies that bolster operational pillars of effective DataOps, scalability, optimal data processing, and organizational flexibility.\n\nIn doing so, data teams should consider adopting data virtualization and containerization capabilities to improve agility and resource efficiency.\n\nLeverage metadata management while planning for growth\n\nWork to implement robust metadata management practices to improve data discoverability, understanding, and governance.\n\nAs part of planning for future (perhaps inevitable) growth, design data architectures and systems to allow for easy adaption and scaling. Use metadata to automate data lineage, data cataloging, and impact analysis.\n\nEmbrace ongoing learning\n\nAs part of laying the foundations for future growth, DataOps initiatives should encourage team members to continually seek out, evaluate, and adopt emerging technologies and practices that will benefit the organization over time.\n\nDataOps is a journey, not a destination. As such, opportunities and areas of improvement should always be identified as part of a culture of testing, learning, and growing.\n\nCommon roadblocks to DataOps implementation (and how data contracts help)\n\nWhether an organization is just getting off the ground or has already experienced some measure of success, DataOps practices may be poorly defined or functionality non-existent. This is also common and commonly attributed to one or a combination of many of the challenges that follow. Fortunately, drafting and implementing a robust data contract can help in all cases.\n\nChange-averse cultures\n\nIt’s not uncommon for progressive thinkers to face resistance from within when trying to inspire a shift towards more collaborative, agile approaches to data management. Reluctance to adopt new processes (even those that are clearly beneficial) in addition to existing departmental silos can hinder DataOps initiatives before they can even begin.\n\nIn these situations, the data contract drafting process can act as a cultural balm, as it necessitates a clear definition of expectations, responsibilities, and roles of all parties involved in data management and usage (not just those directly involved in data analytics). The drafting process also mitigates resistance to new workflows by setting and/or codifying standardized processes all stakeholders must agree upon.\n\nSkill or knowledge deficits\n\nEven a modest implementation of DataOps requires a healthy mix of skills that span data engineering, data science, software development, and operations. Depending on their size or maturity, an organization may lack the diverse skill set and experience needed to integrate these distinct disciplines effectively.\n\nNo data contract is capable of directly addressing gaps in skills and experience. The implementation of data contracts does, however, clarify standards and requirements for data security, access, and quality. As such, they can indirectly guide employee training and development.\n\nInadequate data governance\n\nAs mentioned, effective DataOps relies on the foundation of solid data governance. Therefore, organizations may struggle to implement governance frameworks that are both robust and agile enough to support modern DataOps practices.\n\nData contracts directly support governance within an organization by establishing clear guidelines for data usage, sharing, and management. The framework for compliance and data quality standards established as they’re drafted makes governance more actionable and aligned with ensuing DataOps goals.\n\nComplexities regarding data integration\n\nThe ability to integrate data from a variety of sources presents significant technical challenges, especially in complex or legacy IT environments. This complexity can stall the progress of DataOps implementation by making data pipelines hard to manage or brittle.\n\nConversely, data contracts simplify integration efforts by specifying data interfaces, standards, and formats. This ensures that raw data from any number of sources will be compatible with the organization’s data infrastructure and can be processed and analyzed with optimal efficiency.\n\nPervasive data quality issues\n\nPoor data quality is (unfortunately) a common challenge in the business world, undermining analytics and eroding trust in data-driven decision-making. This can be an open secret too, with employees painfully aware of the issues substandard data is causing while struggling to quantify what exactly is to blame.\n\nThe metrics, validation processes, and remediation steps for non-compliance that data contracts define can make this a non-issue within organizations. This proactive approach (which is always ideal, especially in enterprise data environments) quickly becomes instrumental in maintaining high data quality across the organization.\n\nDifficulties in scaling data operations\n\nFinally, as organizations grow, it’s increasingly challenging to scale data operations efficiently while maintaining data quality. DataOps aims to address scalability issues but, ironically, a lack of foresight and flexibility regarding processes and infrastructure can prevent this from happening.\n\nData contracts circumvent these issues through the guidelines and expectations for data infrastructure, processing capabilities, and performance metrics they crystalize. This ensures that as the volume of data an organization must subsist on grows, systems and processes adapt and scale accordingly.\n\nDrafting an optimal DataOps process\n\nIt’s clear that DataOps functions best at the genetic level of data-driven organizations. It’s also clear that, given such high stakes in the market, business leaders should be doing everything in their power to get their own DataOps right.\n\nAs covered in the last section, data contracts serve as an excellent solution to ensure this happens. That said, the benefits these contracts bring to a data-centric organization extend far beyond DataOps.\n\nFor a quick, digestible, informative primer on data contracts, give Why Data Leaders Opt for Ounces Over Pounds a read.\n\nThis article is part of our blog at Gable.ai — where our goal is to create a shared data culture of collaboration, accountability, quality, and governance.\n\nCurrently, our industry-first approach to drafting and implementing data contracts is in private Beta.",
      "# [About Gable](https://www.gable.ai/about-gable)\nIn 2019, the Gable co-founders: Chad (CEO), Adrian (CTO), and Daniel (Founding Engineer) worked together on the Data Platform team at a late-stage freight tech startup called Convoy. Data was incredibly valuable at Convoy. It drove everything from a central pricing model to dashboards that powered day-to-day business operations. Despite this, data scientists, analysts, and data engineers were constantly dealing with data quality, data governance, and change management issues stemming from issues with upstream source data.\n\nAfter spending time talking to dozens of data teams, the trio realized that the data industry’s approach to managing data at the source was 15 years behind software engineering. Data contracts, integration testing, unit testing, diffs, and monitoring were all sorely lacking outside the Data Warehouse. This caused data quality issues to cascade from upstream sources into the analytical environment spurring an overflow of failed tests and randomly changing data - a problem that made data products fundamentally unscalable. Shortly after, Gable was born, with the mission of creating a data culture of collaboration, accountability, quality, and governance.",
      "# [4 Best Data Producer Practices to Improve Your Data Quality](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-producers)\nData engineering teams and data producers can find it hard to collaborate within an organization for a number of reasons.\n\nPoor data quality is one of them.\n\nFor example, a customer’s address may be recorded incorrectly, which can affect their delivery. Sometimes, there are inconsistent data formats (e.g., inconsistency between two datasets). These issues can make data integration tricky and hamper data analytics. As a consequence, you risk dealing with outages and lose a lot of time that goes into fixing things.\n\nThat’s precisely why you need to gain a thorough understanding of data producers, assess their relationship with data consumers, and follow best practices for data producers to minimize data quality issues and improve your data management.\n\nWho and what are data producers?\n\nA data producer is anything that collects, processes, generates, and stores data that’s relevant to your organization and makes it available for data consumers. This can be a user interface, service, device, system—or human.\n\nData producers serve a key role in data lifecycle as the main source of truth. This information is fed into analysis and decision-making processes. Since data producers often generate unstructured data or raw data, it needs to undergo further processing in order to derive meaningful insights from it.\n\nFor example, a point-of-sale (PoS) system is a data producer for a retail company. It generates raw data in the form of sales transaction records, including customer information, product ID, and purchase details. You can perform processing and analysis on this data via customer segmentation or sales trend analysis to understand consumer buying behavior.\n\nSoftware engineers, on the other hand, are also data producers because they develop and maintain systems and applications that generate large amounts of data. They create transactional databases, message queues like Kafka topics, and other tools that produce data.\n\nData producers vs. data consumers\n\nWhile data producers generate data, a data consumer is an entity that uses it. Data consumers copy this data, perform data transformations on it, or send it to other systems. Some examples of data consumers include marketing automation platforms, BI platforms, data analysts, and data scientists. In the case of data analysts, Python, SQL, and other tools can analyze, transform, or visualize data.\n\nTechnical overview of data producers\n\nConsider an ecommerce website that uses a database to store product information, customer profiles, and transaction records. The website's API serves as the intermediary, enabling seamless communication between the database and the front-end interface. The website provides users with a user-friendly interface to browse products, add items to their cart, and complete purchases.\n\nWhen it comes to data producers, your data follows a unidirectional path. In other words, data only flows upstream or downstream at any given time. In this example, the data follows a unidirectional flow, starting from the database, where product information and customer details are stored. The API then processes this data and delivers it to the front-end interface, allowing users to view product listings, add items to their cart, and make purchases. User interactions with the front-end interface, such as selecting products and completing payments, are returned to the API and then stored in the database.\n\nWhat you should keep in mind is that a data producer can function as a data consumer in a different context. The database functions as the data producer when it generates and stores data for the website. The API is the data consumer when it retrieves the data from the database.\n\nHowever, the API becomes the data producer when the front-end interface (acting as a data consumer) calls it to retrieve data. Similarly, the front-end interface can become a data producer for the customer who is now the data consumer that goes through the information provided on the website.\n\nData producer examples\n\nData producers can consist of any of the following:\n\nSoftware engineers act as data producers when they develop applications or systems that generate data during user interactions.\n\nSales associates contribute as data producers when they record customer interactions and sales transactions into company systems. The data they generate helps to improve customer relationship management and boost sales.\n\nCustomers become data producers by interacting with the company’s platforms via online purchases and social media engagement. Their activities generate valuable data on user preferences, behaviors, and feedback. This data helps to analyze and improve customer experience in the future.\n\nBest practices for data producers\n\nStruggling to maintain standardized data formats and failing to streamline data integration can leave your organization behind the curve and impact your decision-making processes. Data engineering managers should consider the following best practices for data producers to improve data management within their organization.\n\n1. Understand your data sources\n\nYou need to understand your data sources when it comes to data producers. When you assess how the data was created and its context, you can identify potential inaccuracies, biases, or limitations.\n\nFor instance, an automated employee attendance tracking system is a data producer. The system serves as the data producer by generating and recording employee attendance data. Understanding the data source—in this case, a biometric attendance system—allows the office management to identify any potential inaccuracies or limitations. They might recognize that the system may not be able to capture nuanced attendance details, such as the reasons for late arrivals. By reviewing these limitations, office management can implement relevant initiatives such as periodic manual checks to provide more accurate information for data producers.\n\n2. Introduce metadata management\n\nMetadata management provides context and information about the data. It helps data producers understand the structure, meaning, and relationships within a dataset. For instance, data producers, such as customer service agents, need to know how the customer data is organized with the CRM system.\n\nMetadata management includes documenting and categorizing different data types within the CRM system via a data catalog. This can help agents understand whether the data is numerical, textual, or categorical. They can also learn about relationships between different data entities. For example, it can uncover how customer data is linked to past purchases or interactions.\n\n3. Implement data quality assurance\n\nData quality assurance is an ongoing process to ensure data is accurate, reliable, consistent, and relevant. It includes using a wide range of techniques and practices to maintain and improve the quality of data that producers generate. This process involves validating data at the point of entry, identifying and resolving errors within it, and ensuring it remains consistent across different systems throughout the organization.\n\nConsider a financial firm where a transaction monitoring system serves as a data producer. The system generates data on customer transactions, account activities, and financial operations. Implementing data quality assurance in this context includes validating how accurate the transaction data is, ensuring data is standardized and consistent across different accounts, and detecting any potential fraudulent activities. This can be done through real-time transaction monitoring, anomaly detection algorithms, and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance checks.\n\n4. Use a data collaboration management platform\n\nGartner analysts predict that by next year, 50% of businesses will embrace a modern data quality solution.\n\nAfter GitHub was launched in 2008, it quickly became a must-have tool for software development teams throughout the world for companies of all scales. GitHub helped teams to manage and track code effectively in a collaborative environment.\n\nSimilar to how GitHub was highly needed for software teams, there’s a need for a collaboration management tool for data teams. Fortunately, Gable.ai fills this vacuum. Gable.ai can bridge the gap between data producers and data consumers. By introducing data contracts and a data collaboration system, the platform can help to improve data quality, consistency, and communication.\n\nFor example, if you have an order processing system as a data producer and an inventory management system as a data consumer, Gable.ai can create data contracts for them. These contracts define specific data parameters that are required by the inventory system and ensure that the order processing system produces data according to its needs.\n\nRevolutionize the way you communicate data between your data producers and consumers",

      "# [Practical Solutions for 5 Complex Data Lineage Challenges](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-lineage-challenges)\nComplexity isn’t inherently good or bad—it simply is. But as data environments become more varied and interconnected, managing this complexity requires tools and practices that match the challenges of these increasingly intricate systems.\n\nData-driven leaders in modern organizations must implement data lineage practices that document data’s journey and ensure regulatory compliance, scalability, and interoperability across complex data environments.\n\n(This is where Ashby’s Law of Requisite Variety can offer some interesting context. Originally associated with cybernetics, Ashby’s Law cautions that the control measures we apply to data must be as nuanced and varied as the data environments themselves.)\n\nIn this respect, large and intricate data environments can complicate data lineage practices, along with the assurances and benefits they provide.\n\nThese challenges are swelling as data environments increasingly consist of a mix of cloud-based and on-premises software and systems. Yet despite this growing complexity, maintaining pristine data lineage practices is a must.\n\nWe’ll break down the basics of why modern data environments challenge data leaders by examining five common yet critical challenges—and, most importantly, highlighting what data leaders can do to mitigate them.\n\nWhy data lineage has to keep pace with increasingly complex data environments\n\nTo ensure that we’re all on the same page, let’s define data lineage as the process and practice of tracking and documenting data flow (i.e., data’s journey) throughout its lifecycle. The tracking process should begin at a dataset’s origin point and continue through the various transformations it undergoes as it moves through an organization, up until it reaches its end users (i.e., data consumers).\n\nOver time, lineage practices build detailed records that show how organizations create, modify, move, and consume data within their environments. These records provide a persistent view into data quality, help identify and resolve related issues, and enable teams to keep data private, protected, and compliant.\n\n5 data lineage challenges that are common to complex data environments\n\nModern data environments present unique and often compounding challenges for data lineage tracking. As systems grow more interconnected and data flows become more intricate, visualization emerges as a critical tool for understanding and managing this complexity. By enabling clear insights into data origins, movement, and transformations, visualization helps leaders identify bottlenecks, ensure compliance, and maintain data quality.\n\nThe following data lineage challenges illustrate the specific difficulties that arise within today’s complex data ecosystems. As such, they also illustrate why effective data lineage practices are a must in overcoming them:\n\n1. Managing the impact of diverse data environments\n\nIt’s a smart bet that the operative elements of data environments will continue to diversify for the foreseeable future. As a result, data assets within organizations will need to flow across an increasingly complex collection of data pipelines and data systems. The data ecosystems and other factors that together form modern data environments—such as cloud-based, on-premises, and legacy systems, as well as various data formats—are also likely to diversify further.\n\nAccording to Ashby’s Law, which we discussed earlier, effective control measures will then need to evolve in order to match the complexity they manage. For data leaders, this means that data governance and metadata management practices must evolve to keep up with the demands of this increasingly varied environment.\n\nAs demands on organizational data grow, each added system ratchets up operational complexity. This complexity, in turn, can reduce visibility into data origins and data movement, making data lineage tracking difficult and potentially compromising data quality.\n\n2. Maintaining the flexibility to manage data lineage at scale\n\nIn addition to data environment diversity, data volumes grow exponentially while the data that organizations increasingly rely on grows more complex. This two-tiered, exponential growth places new demands on today’s data lineage tools, which must now keep pace with real-time data transformations and data processing at scale.\n\nAs Ashby’s Law suggests, without control measures that match this complexity, organizations risk bottlenecks, resource strain, and increased storage costs, all of which impact decision-making and operational efficiency. As a result, data leaders need scalable solutions that evolve alongside their data ecosystems to ensure that lineage remains effective as complexity increases.\n\n3. Adapting to the rapid pace of data-related environmental evolution\n\nToday’s data management trends show how data environments evolve rapidly, as data teams and engineers regularly introduce new pipelines, transformations, and sources. This dynamic landscape presents constant challenges for data lineage tracking, as updates must keep pace with each new addition or modification. Moreover, in such a fast-moving environment, lineage information can quickly become outdated, creating risks for maintaining data integrity and compliance.\n\nWithout accurate, up-to-date lineage, data engineers may understandably struggle with essential practices like root cause analysis, which impede their ability to diagnose data issues promptly and increase the likelihood of compliance gaps.\n\n4. Rising compliance and security demands\n\nAs data ecosystems grow in complexity, so do the risks surrounding compliance and data security. For organizations that handle sensitive data, achieving regulatory compliance across diverse data environments—especially when subject to strict standards like GDPR or CCPA—requires exceptionally precise data lineage tracking.\n\nGaps in tracking data origins or data movement can lead to compliance failures and expose the organization to serious legal and financial risks. These vulnerabilities underscore why data leaders must adopt a proactive, security-focused approach to data lineage, ensuring compliance and mitigating risks before they become critical issues.\n\n5. Ensuring tool integration without the risk of vendor lock-in\n\nAmid growing data ecosystems, the integration of diverse tools is essential for comprehensive data lineage tracking. Yet relying on proprietary data lineage tools can create silos that lead to vendor lock-in. This result limits flexibility and makes it difficult to adapt to future needs.\n\nWhen vendor-specific solutions restrict interoperability, organizations may lack a unified view of their data lineage, as these tools often lack compatibility with other data systems or data catalogs. This limitation ultimately prevents data teams from fully leveraging the value of their data environment, which impacts scalability and hinders long-term strategic flexibility.\n\nProactive solutions from a data management perspective\n\nYou’ve probably noticed by now—the five challenges we’ve called out here are distinct but complementary. Each addresses unique aspects of data lineage complexity. That said, it would be counterproductive to tackle them in isolation.\n\nAs the poet once said, no ecosystem, API, or data source within a data environment is an island. Therefore, as we walk through each proposed solution to these complex data lineage challenges, we must view all data lineage challenges holistically and keep our solutioning firmly tethered to data management best practices:\n\nDealing with data ecosystem diversification\n\nIt’s advisable to consider centralized data lineage management tools and data catalogs as table stakes for any forward-looking data-driven organization.\n\nHowever, in doing so, data leaders must ensure they consistently enforce metadata management and data integrity practices across the entirety of their data environment—forming a bedrock for data teams, enabling them to maintain superior overall data quality and transparency while reducing risks of blind spots in the data environment.\n\nBeyond improving visibility, teams that maintain well-integrated ecosystems streamline compliance audits and troubleshoot issues more quickly, boosting efficiency and enhancing data collaboration across teams and departments. Additionally, these efforts enhance cross-team collaboration which, in turn, support optimal data sharing and joint decision-making.\n\nScale-proofing data lineage management\n\nAs data volumes and complexity continue to grow, embracing scalable solutions becomes non-negotiable. Automated lineage tracking and data observability tools that can scale both horizontally and vertically are critical for managing lineage at scale. Paired with efficient lineage information storage solutions, these tools help data teams keep performance high, even as data volume and complexity continue to increase.\n\nKeep in mind, though, that this scalability isn’t just about handling data growth. Viewed holistically, data leaders must also implement controls that evolve to match the complexity of the data environment itself—just as Ashby’s Law recommends. With these scalable tools, data teams and stakeholders gain faster access to insights without overburdening resources, enabling real-time data-driven decisions.\n\nLeaders who leverage automated solutions in this way also help keep costs manageable, as these solutions guardrail against the potentially high expenses of manual management, storage, and processing. For leaders who are focused on maximizing ROI, this ability to keep pace with data growth without incurring excessive resource costs is critical.\n\nKeeping one’s bearings as the data environment evolves\n\nAdaptability is essential for staying ahead of any data environment. For this reason, access to automated lineage updates and version control on lineage records allows data teams and leaders to keep up with rapid changes in data pipelines and transformations. This approach becomes a win-win, as it enables stakeholders to ensure that lineage information remains current—which, in turn, allows teams to conduct accurate root cause analysis and maintain data integrity.\n\nBy maintaining an auditable history of data flow changes, data leaders position themselves to provide the transparency required to uphold regulatory compliance standards, especially when addressing legacy data or tracing past data issues.\n\nTaking a helpful cue from Ashby’s Law, control systems must match the rate of change within the environment. Embedding data contracts with update protocols for lineage brings added stability and predictability, making lineage maintenance measurable and manageable as environments evolve. This approach helps forward-thinking data leaders allocate resources more effectively while ensuring that lineage remains both accurate and adaptable.\n\nStaying ahead of compliance and security needs\n\nAs regulatory requirements become stricter, proactively managing compliance has never been more important. For organizations that handle sensitive data, data lineage tools with tracking features for sensitive data can ensure regulatory compliance with standards like GDPR and CCPA.\n\nBut tools alone aren’t enough. As Ashby’s Law reminds us, teams must do more than implement control measures that match the complexity of the data ecosystem to meet compliance demands. They must also implement data protection measures and strong data governance to secure data flows.\n\nWhat’s more, data contracts play a critical role in reinforcing security by establishing lineage standards and setting clear protocols for auditability and data integrity. Leadership who leverage data contracts to guide regular data lineage audits improve their organization’s compliance practices, promote ongoing adherence to regulatory standards, minimize risk exposure, and enhance overall data ecosystem security.\n\nAvoiding problematic tool integrations and vendor lock-in\n\nOrganizations rely on venture-neutral lineage solutions that integrate seamlessly across data systems to maintain optimal flexibility within complex data ecosystems. Data lineage vendor dependencies undermine the adaptive strategies organizations need to stay ahead of data complexity—no law, Ashby’s or otherwise, is required to see that.\n\nThe smart choice of related tools that avoid restrictive vendor dependencies enables organizations to adapt their lineage processes and practices over time. Moreover, this approach safeguards long-term adaptability by allowing data leaders to upgrade or replace tools without risking disruption to data lineage tracking.\n\nBy following this path, savvy data leaders help organizations avoid becoming confined to a single lineage vendor ecosystem. By protecting this organizational flexibility, orgs can then maximize the value of data-driven decisions and enable scalability and long-term strategic alignment with future data needs.\n\nCharting an optimal way forward: How data contracts set data lineage up to excel\n\nAs helpful as Ashby’s law has been here, there is one final lesson that’s hidden in the scientific field we’ve borrowed from—cybernetics. The term itself comes from the Greek word kybernḗtēs (κυβερνήτης), meaning “steersman” or “pilot.” To the data leaders we’ve been discussing, this is worth bearing in mind—because ultimately, the complexity of today’s data environments demands more than strategic thinking.\n\nSuccess here requires steady hands, experience, and, above all, the grit and vision to navigate the seas of big data as it pitches and heaves against the hull of modern organizations. Like the sailing captains of yore, data lineage management—charting where we’re coming from as the journey unfolds—helps us steer our course true.\n\nBut the power and unpredictability of these seas underscores the importance of enforcing all necessary standards and control measures to ensure that lineage tracking practices remain as flexible, compliant, and effective as possible. That’s why, for leaders who are ready to turn these challenges into strengths, it’s important to understand the role that data contracts can play in transforming data lineage practices into powerful strategic assets.",
      "# [Literate Team: A Comprehensive Guide](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-literacy)\nDefining literacy as only “understanding how reading works” borders on problematic.\n\nBroadly, literacy empowers individuals and enables societal participation. While it begins with acquiring basic skills, literacy requires ongoing learning and upskilling to evolve into an experiential foundation—one that enables individuals to navigate increasingly complex social, cultural, and relational landscapes. As such, it plays a critical role in fostering individual growth and collective progress.\n\nFor data leaders, literacy is a concept worth detailing in this way because it reminds those who trade in data engineering circles (and their data-adjacent peers) that data literacy constitutes far more than simply “understanding data.”\n\nData literacy, much like its conceptual older cousin, is foundational for personal empowerment and professional success in data-driven organizations. It also begins with acquiring basic skills—understanding, analyzing, and manipulating data—and evolves into an experiential foundation for data professionals.\n\nIn the world of data engineering, this subfloor enables the data-literate to navigate increasingly complex organizational, strategically focused, and technologically complex data environments (and the organizations that increasingly depend upon them). As such, data literacy plays a critical role in fostering individual growth within the profession, helping both data professionals and leaders improve their decision-making while advancing collective progress within data-driven cultures.\n\nIt's no wonder that many data leaders prioritize data literacy and the upskilling needed to support it. Fortunately, achieving this goal is simpler than it seems. First, one simply needs to determine how data-literate their organization is at the moment. That information forms the foundation for operationalizing an organization’s data culture and ensuring that it supports ongoing learning and upskilling to bolster data literacy.\n\nA four-point process for assessing your organization’s current data literacy\n\nTo improve data literacy skills within an organization, one must first understand the current level of those skills skills. However, assessing an entire company’s data skills can seem daunting, especially for data leaders operating at the enterprise level.\n\nFirst, don’t panic. Start by assessing key teams or departments based on the business’s needs and time-to-impact. Second, consistently follow a structured approach to ensure you can repeat your data literacy assessments as needed and scale to your needs over time.\n\nAs such, here’s a simple but effective approach you could follow to assess your company's needs.\n\n1. Define what data literacy means in your organization and industry\n\nUsing our broad definition above as a starting point, tailor your definition of data literacy to your organization’s specific goals, challenges, and context, as well as its industry.\n\nFor example, the chief data officer of a B2B software startup might focus on product usage metrics, customer behavior, and market trends. In contrast, a chief technology officer at a mid-sized bank might emphasize financial data interpretation, risk management, and regulatory compliance. Meanwhile, the head of analytics at a healthcare wearable devices company could decide to invest more time focusing on healthcare data quality, interoperability, and the ethical use of patient data.\n\nAs a rule, data leaders should treat their data literacy definitions as minimum viable products. These definitions should include just enough detail to capture key organizational realities—such as business operations and stakeholder priorities—while balancing general data knowledge (understanding, interpreting, and communicating data) with role-specific competencies.\n\n2. Conduct an initial assessment\n\nArmed with a clear data literacy definition, data leaders can conduct an initial assessment to establish a baseline of the organization’s current data literacy levels. In most cases, leaders use one or more methods to gather this information: surveys and self-assessments, quizzes and tests, and practical assessments.\n\nEach method offers unique advantages and drawbacks which require leaders to balance their approach based on organizational needs.\n\nSurveys and self-assessments\n\nSurveys typically involve structured questionnaires to gauge individuals’ perceptions of their data skills. Self-assessments allow employees to evaluate their own competencies based on predefined criteria or scales.\n\nPros:\n\nQuick to deploy across large groups with minimal resources\n\nCaptures employees' confidence levels, attitudes toward data, and perceived skill gaps\n\nSuitable for organization-wide assessments\n\nCons:\n\nPotential for bias or inaccuracy from self-reported results\n\nMay not fully capture actual technical skills or application abilities\n\nIdeal for:\n\nInitial benchmarking of organizational data literacy levels\n\nIdentifying perceived gaps to guide further assessments or training programs\n\nQuizzes and tests\n\nStandardized tests or quizzes measure objective knowledge of data concepts, tools, and processes. Formats may include multiple-choice questions, theoretical concept tests, or scenario-based problem-solving.\n\nPros:\n\nProvides quantitative results that are easy to compare and track over time\n\nCan assess specific skills like data visualization, statistical analysis, or tool proficiency\n\nMay use platforms with auto-grading functionality, increasing efficiency\n\nCons:\n\nFocuses on theoretical knowledge rather than real-world application\n\nPotential misrepresentation of skills from test anxiety or format confusion\n\nIdeal for:\n\nAssessing baseline technical knowledge\n\nTracking progress after training programs\n\nPractical assessments\n\nInvolving hands-on tasks that require employees to apply their data skills in real-world scenarios, these assessments focus on common yet critical situations such as analyzing datasets and creating dashboards.\n\nPros:\n\nMeasures how well individuals can apply knowledge in practical contexts\n\nHighlights critical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and tool proficiency\n\nEnables targeted coaching based on observed performance gaps\n\nCons:\n\nRequires significant time for setup, evaluation, and feedback\n\nDifficult to administer across large teams without automation tools\n\nIdeal for:\n\nEvaluating team readiness for specific projects or roles\n\nIdentifying high-potential employees for advanced training\n\n3. Categorize and analyze your assessment results\n\nAfter completing the assessment, data leaders should categorize the gathered information to facilitate analysis. Although additional steps may be necessary based on business needs, initial assessments typically focus on three key actions: grouping employees, identifying gaps, and evaluating behavioral indicators.\n\nFirst, group employees into categories (novice, intermediate, or advanced) based on their skills and roles. Next, identify gaps in knowledge or skills at both individual and organizational levels. Finally, assess behavioral indicators, such as how employees apply data insights in decision-making or validate data sources.\n\nThese steps provide a clear picture of your organization's current data literacy and its key areas for improvement.\n\n4. Blueprint a data literacy roadmap\n\nUltimately, once categorization and analysis are complete, data leaders should apply a competency framework—a structured model that clearly defines the data knowledge, competencies, and skills employees need to succeed across roles and proficiency levels, from beginner to expert.\n\nLeaders should start by adopting existing frameworks (like Databilities or Future Skills) or templates to prioritize effective implementation, foster internal adoption, troubleshoot challenges, and build valuable feedback loops. This approach actively engages organizational culture, driving long-term data literacy growth.\n\nPutting a data-centric culture to work: Increasing knowledge and improving skills\n\nPerhaps the most impactful cultures begin with a clear understanding that no culture is innate. They are living constructs that, like data literacy, organizations define, invest in, and enrich through collective action and individual contributions.\n\nAdditionally, culture isn’t just a “vibe.” No amount of talent, skill, experience, or budget can create culture on its own—especially not a data-centric one. In this sense, a three-person startup in a garage is just as capable of building a strong culture as a global technology giant.\n\nData leaders—and leadership as a whole—must actively shape a culture they can put to work, knowing that the ongoing impact of any data literacy program by way of organizational culture depends on how effectively the latter fosters action, learning, and growth.\n\nThat said, putting one's culture to work to improve data literacy and related skills should begin through a strategic focus on seven specific steps:\n\n1. Embed data literacy into the core of organizational culture\n\nLeaders must set the tone by using data to guide their decisions at every opportunity. When executives and managers consistently rely on data quality, data quality rules, and data-driven insights, they send a clear signal to all levels of the organization that facts and figures matter. By leading through action, leaders encourage everyone—regardless of function—to consider how data can inform and improve everyday tasks.\n\nIn addition, managers should openly encourage experimentation and provide employees with the freedom to test new hypotheses and learn from any shortcomings. This trust-forward environment drives creativity and builds employees’ confidence in applying their data literacy skills.\n\nStorytelling can also play a key role in this cultural shift. When leaders share success stories highlighting specific ways that data has improved processes or driven tangible outcomes, they reinforce the value of data-centric thinking and show how it directly benefits both individuals and teams.\n\n2. Build a supportive corresponding data infrastructure\n\nA culture that values data literacy needs to provide employees with all the necessary tools, systems, and policies to succeed. Robust data repositories, for example, help employees access accurate, reliable information whenever they need it. Investing in user-friendly, self-service analytics platforms further promotes independence by allowing employees to explore data and generate insights without waiting on specialized teams.\n\nEqually important, data governance policies must be clear, transparent, and actively enforced. These policies ensure that data remains accurate, secure, and trustworthy—building organization-wide confidence in the information employees use to make decisions.\n\nWhen employees believe in the quality and security of their data, they are far more likely to adopt data-driven practices across different roles.\n\n3. Provide tailored training and upskilling opportunities\n\nOrganizations should design training programs that align with various teams’ unique data needs, to ensure that each employee learns the specific skills that are most relevant to their role.\n\nFor example, marketing departments that are looking to strengthen their data skills might focus on mastering data analytics tools that track customer engagement, while finance teams could specialize in predictive modeling and forecasting. This is important, as employees who clearly understand how data literacy can enhance their everyday tasks become more invested in their own learning.\n\nTo support this growing interest, organizations must offer diverse learning opportunities that align with different roles and learning styles. Combining workshops, online courses, and hands-on projects provides a blended learning model that appeals to various learning preferences. Gamification techniques, such as monthly “hackathons,” can also boost engagement. These initiatives not only reinforce newly acquired skills but also promote camaraderie and friendly competition, further embedding data literacy into the workplace experience.\n\n4. Establish a continuous learning ecosystem\n\nTo maintain momentum, data leaders need to lead by example, treating data literacy as an ongoing journey rather than a one-time initiative. Integrating data literacy into onboarding programs sets the foundation early, ensuring that new hires understand the organization’s commitment to data-driven practices from day one. Regular refresher courses reinforce this culture of learning and prevent knowledge gaps from growing over time.\n\nProviding resources like data glossaries and shared vocabularies also helps employees navigate complex datasets confidently and consistently. When an individual can easily reference standardized terminology and access self-service analytics tools, they feel empowered to deepen their data literacy skills independently.\n\n5. Incentivize data literacy adoption\n\nOrganizations should align incentives with data-centric behaviors and reward employees who apply data-driven insights to solve business problems or improve processes. Recognizing these contributions through performance bonuses, public acknowledgment in team meetings, or promotions linked to data competency sends a strong message about the value of data literacy.\n\nWhen employees see tangible rewards for embracing data, they are more likely to experiment, learn, and share successes with their colleagues. This positive reinforcement loops back into the culture, perpetually motivating teams to raise the bar on how they use data.\n\n6. Foster collaboration across departments\n\nEncouraging cross-functional teams to tackle data-focused projects promotes knowledge exchange and breaks down organizational silos. When employees from marketing, finance, operations, and other areas pool their expertise and insights, they can uncover powerful new ways to use data. These collaborations help non-data teams see firsthand how data-driven insights benefit their work.\n\nDesignating “data champions” within each department can accelerate this process. These champions mentor peers on data best practices and advocate for continued adoption. By creating formal and informal forums for sharing insights, organizations reinforce the idea that data literacy is everyone’s responsibility, not just the domain of specialized teams.\n\n7. Monitor progress, demonstrate ROI, and keep literacy aligned with business goals over time\n\nOrganizations should regularly assess data literacy, just as they did to establish their operational baseline, by measuring improvements in data literacy with tools such as surveys, skill assessments, or analytics tool usage statistics. By continuing to track these key metrics, leaders can identify gaps, refine training efforts, and maintain momentum.\n\nMeasuring the impact of increased data literacy on business outcomes—such as operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, or revenue growth—also highlights the tangible value of these initiatives. Further sharing success stories and metrics organization-wide energizes employees and reinforces the importance of continuously refining data skill sets.\n\nWhen everyone sees real-life examples of data-driven projects that achieved or exceeded their goals, it inspires broader participation and strengthens the organization’s data culture.\n\nBy combining these strategies, organizations can ensure that their efforts to build a data-centric culture not only enhance employee skills but also deliver tangible benefits, such as improved job performance, more career growth opportunities, and greater organizational efficiency.\n\nKeeping a strong data culture focused on what matters\n\nThe hidden benefit of culture is how, in a short time, it aligns more of the organization toward a single operational direction. Add a culture that fosters and rewards continuous learners, and the true power of data quickly comes to light, regardless of industry or business type.\n\nIn a data-literate organization, treating data as a product becomes the norm, and edge cases turn into use cases that highlight ROI. Skill levels overshadow titles and pay scales, empowering employees to advance within the organization.\n\nHowever, this transformation doesn’t happen on its own. Data leaders must actively champion these changes by embedding data-driven decision-making and innovative data strategies into daily operations. This hands-on leadership ensures these practices become standard—data-literate normalization at its finest.\n\nOver time, data literacy can begin to drive itself, shifting data leaders’ roles from pushing and supporting to guiding and challenging. At this stage, it becomes more important to focus on where a strong data culture is going, not where it has been. This is where the concept of shifting data left and the role of the next generation of data contracts come into play.\n\nBy integrating data quality and governance earlier in the development process, organizations can accelerate innovation and reduce costly errors—unlocking the full potential of their data strategies.",
      "# [4 Types of Data Mesh Challenges (and How to Overcome Them)](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-mesh-challenges)\nAmong the many controversial concepts in data engineering, data mesh might currently be the most deserving of the title “It’s complicated.”\n\nIntroduced by Zhamak Dehghani in 2019, the concept of data mesh aims to address inefficiencies and limitations in centralized data management systems. For this reason, many see this approach to data federation as admirable—especially at the rate modern organizations are vacuuming up data to maintain an edge over their competitors.\n\nAs is all too apparent, traditional centralized methods of data management are increasingly ill-equipped to keep pace.\n\nHowever, what’s been a game changer to some has run afoul to others, as their attempts to solve organizational issues have created more data mesh challenges than solutions.\n\nThis begs an important question for data leaders: is data mesh a winning workaround or a wicked problem?\n\nLet’s do the smart thing and break down both sides for analysis to see if we can make more sense of this mess of the mesh.\n\nWhat is data mesh and why was it created?\n\nData mesh is a decentralized, self-service approach to data architecture that organizes data around specific business domains—marketing, customer service, and sales are common examples.\n\nCompared to traditional centralized data infrastructures, data mesh shifts the responsibility for data management and governance to domain teams who are better positioned to understand and use their own data products.\n\nIn practice, each of these teams then takes responsibility for collecting, transforming, and managing their own data. However, all domain teams bear the added responsibility of treating their data as a product to make the approach viable organization-wide. This means that regardless of department, data teams take it upon themselves to make sure all datasets are easy to consume, maintain clear ownership, and meet all quality and usability standards of their organization.\n\nLike any approach to managing data, benefits vary across organizations and industries. But in general, proponents of data mesh cite four major advantages that it has over traditional, centralized methods of data management.\n\n1. Increased scalability and flexibility\n\nData mesh architecture enables domain teams to manage their own data products. In doing so, teams can standardize and reuse products across their organization. This freedom facilitates faster scaling while allowing teams more flexibility to adapt to changes. Over time, this allows organizations to scale more efficiently.\n\n2. Enhanced collaboration and innovation\n\nSelf-serve data management also bolsters collaboration within organizations, as data democratization is a key operational tenet. This is because, once implemented, data mesh enables teams to discover and use high-quality data for decision-making and experimentation—without relying on a centralized IT team to provide input and access.\n\n3. Faster time to value\n\nThis freedom also decouples domain teams from lengthy approval processes that too often hinder innovation in large organizations. As a result, teams can iterate quickly during development cycles, unlocking insights from data products in smaller time frames, which can quickly become a competitive advantage in a rapidly changing business environment.\n\n4. Improved data quality\n\nArguably, the most important competitive advantage of all is the net increase in data quality that data mesh contributes to. This is due to how self-service data models encourage teams to see and use their data as a valuable commodity as opposed to byproducts of the business’s processes.\n\nWhat’s more, data mesh encourages domain teams to contribute their own subject matter expertise to their data through their governance of it. This promotes a more holistic lifecycle approach that fosters long-term value and usability.\n\nAdditionally, data mesh can solve specific issues that data leaders face—especially in industries that require more specialized workforces and higher levels of data compliance and regulation.\n\nData mesh over centralization: Key benefits for data leaders\n\nWhile centralized data architectures have long been the standard, they can struggle to meet the demands of modern organizations.\n\nAs businesses grow and evolve, the limitations of centralization—like bottlenecks, data silos, and a lack of domain expertise—can hinder operational efficiency and innovation.\n\nLack of domain expertise\n\nCentralized teams may lack the detailed domain knowledge required to manage data effectively for specific business needs.\n\nThis is especially true in highly specialized industries with unique complexities, like finance and healthcare, where centralized teams often lack the detailed domain knowledge necessary to effectively manage and use data for specific business needs.\n\nHowever, when data mesh allows teams to organize data around business domains, it empowers domain experts to take ownership of their data—ensuring it is managed and used in ways most relevant and valuable to their specific objectives.\n\nBottlenecks\n\nOne of the most notable issues with traditional data architecture is how it often relies on centralized data teams and platforms (like data lakes or warehouses). Even when managed adamantly, this centralization will be prone to enabling bottlenecks.\n\nThis is because as an organization begins to grow, business units need improved data access over time to support increased coordination and communication needs. However, centralized systems can’t scale gracefully as operational demand ratchets up. As such, departments begin to struggle as data access suffers from bottlenecking.\n\nAlternatively, data leaders can leverage data mesh to avoid bottlenecking by assigning ownership of data to domain-specific teams. This way, there are no bottlenecks as domain teams manage their own data as a product, thus reducing or eliminating reliance on a central team for data access needs.\n\nPoor operational agility\n\nData itself grows more complex and nuanced as organizations grow larger. Centralized data platforms can only adapt so much before new requirements call for extensive re-engineering to keep pace.\n\nDomain-oriented approaches, designed as scalable frameworks, sidestep these overhaul issues and provide organizations with the agility to continuously respond to changing business environments and technological advancements.\n\nData silos\n\nIn many organizations that have undergone extensive growth, it’s common for data to become siloed as different departments adopt new tools and procedures to address immediate needs, rather than big-picture data management cohesion (understandably so). Organizational growth also commonly involves the creation of new business units or departments that each use potentially incompatible systems and practices.\n\nIronically, the data mesh “divide and conquer” decentralization approach can actively counter this siloing, as stakeholders typically establish a central registry or catalog that registers all domain-owned data products. Post-implementation, this registry allows other teams to easily discover and access data across domains without barriers.\n\nAll together, this makes data mesh seem like an exceptional solution for modern organizations. Why, then, do others view data mesh as more trouble than it’s worth?\n\nFour specific shortcomings: Why some data leaders feel the mesh is more trouble than it’s worth\n\nDepending on specific use cases, no approach to data management is perfect. However, understanding the shortcomings and challenges of data mesh is vital for parsing “less than perfect” from “far too problematic.”\n\nFirst, let’s look at some straightforward aspects that data leaders should be aware of before digging into the most complex challenges inherent in data mesh.\n\nHigh transformation costs\n\nWhen transitioning away from centralized data management, data managers should expect data mesh implementation to be both costly and resource-intensive. In addition to establishing decentralized ownership and building self-service infrastructure, leaders must enable change management to create lasting cultural shifts within their organization. While this is entirely possible, it’s never entirely easy.\n\nThe idea of owning their own data can be a challenge for some data teams. They may also need to accept and undergo training and upskilling in order to own their own data products and implement governance practices.\n\nRisks of reintroducing data silos\n\nAs noted, a core principle of data mesh is that data products should be interoperable and adhere to global standards. However, not all data teams within a given organization may put this core principle into practice. Ironically, in these situations, a data mesh infrastructure can lead to new data silos even as it helps deconstruct traditional ones.\n\nPoor governance and inadequate communication between domains can also contribute to siloed information post-implementation, as data leaders and stakeholders still require centralized coordination and oversight to keep decentralization from devolving into data fragmentation.\n\nIncreased complexities in data management\n\nIn addition to change management, leadership that’s implementing data mesh is also signing up for more demanding data management overall. At the outset, data leaders must oversee the creation of the self-serve platforms their domain teams will use. They must also manage the newly federated governance their org will rely on while ensuring that communication between the distributed components of the mesh itself is as seamless as possible.\n\nWhile domain teams work to maximize data quality, it’s the responsibility of leadership to ensure said actual quality manifests. This requires their working with multiple teams that will naturally have varying priorities and expertise.\n\nMisaligned changes by one team can lead to downstream issues for data consumers, such as broken dashboards or incorrect analytics.\n\nOwnership and data governance challenges\n\nIf the herding of data quality cats wasn’t enough, determining clear ownership boundaries can be difficult for organizations using data mesh architecture. Competing business priorities and unclear responsibilities can exacerbate these issues, leading to confusion and inefficiencies in governance.\n\nThese muddied waters can lead to data quality issues or compound those that may already exist. But data leaders may also face additional critical issues due to ownership ambiguity, including accountability gaps, duplication of efforts (or datasets) between product owners, operational inefficiencies, increased security risks, additional overhead, and organization-wide trust issues relating to the accuracy and value of data in general.\n\nIn summary, while data mesh offers significant benefits in terms of scalability, flexibility, and improved data quality, it also presents challenges related to cost, complexity, and governance. Organizations considering this architecture must weigh these factors carefully and plan thoroughly to ensure successful implementation.\n\nMin-maxing: How data contracts can help teams maximize data mesh ROI\n\nFor some, debating the principles of data mesh can make for an enjoyable afternoon on LinkedIn. Others, however, are actively down in the trenches, endeavoring to make data mesh deliver for their organization (or will soon join those who are).\n\nThese individuals need the data mesh concept to deliver and can’t submit to pain points we’ve mentioned here—such as governance gaps, ownership clarity, and data quality issues. This is why these individuals should realize that, by properly drafting and implementing a data contract, they can alleviate most of the mess inherent in modern-day meshing.\n\nTo clarify, let’s directly address each of the four common shortcomings above to provide a sense of just how much help a singular data contract can be:\n\n1. High transformation costs\n\nData contracts can reduce transformation costs by clearly defining the expectations for data quality, structure, and semantics between data producers and consumers. This minimizes the need for extensive downstream transformations.\n\nBy enforcing schema consistency and providing guarantees about data formats and delivery, data contracts ensure that data is ready for use without requiring additional processing. Those who take this proactive approach can avoid costly reworks caused by any schema changes or quality issues downstream.\n\n2. Data silos\n\nDespite being a common challenge in larger organizations, data contracts mitigate data siloing by fostering interoperability and standardization across all domains and defining clear interfaces for data sharing. In this sense, they supplant the manual needs of domain teams to ensure that their data products are discoverable, self-describing, and accessible across the organization.\n\nMoreover, data contracts promote shared metadata and governance standards, which enhance cross-domain collaboration and prevent dataset isolation.\n\n3. Added complexity to data management\n\nWe can’t avoid any of the complexities data mesh introduces to data management. However, due to the formalization between data sources and consumers, data contracts keep data management of a meshed ecosystem from being more complicated than it needs to be.\n\nContracts also provide transparency into dependencies and usage patterns, streamlining data pipeline management and troubleshooting.\n\nData leaders can benefit further by embedding governance policies directly into their data contracts. By doing so, they can automate compliance checks and reduce manual oversight.\n\n4. Data ownership and governance challenges\n\nFinally, a well-drafted data contract will address ownership and governance challenges by explicitly defining roles, responsibilities, and usage policies for each data product in the organization. They naturally align with the federated governance model of data mesh by balancing domain autonomy with centralized oversight.\n\nContracts also enforce accountability for data quality and compliance, making it easier to manage regulatory requirements and audits.\n\nClearly, a singular data contract can transform what some see as a wicked problem into advantageous architecture. While this may not solve the great debate around the viability of data mesh itself, contracts can certainly benefit those in organizations who’ve already opted to decentralize their data fabric.\n\nFully realize your own data mesh success\n\nIntegrating data contracts into your data mesh strategy can be more than a safeguard—it’s also a multiplier of ROI.\n\nThese contracts bridge the gap between decentralized data ownership and centralized governance, enabling domain teams to operate autonomously while adhering to organization-wide standards.",
      "# [Data Migration Testing: The Case Against Manual Data Validation](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-migration-testing)\nThe amount of data produced on a daily basis is staggering. But all the data in the world doesn’t do much good if it can’t flow between systems, applications, and infrastructures. This is why the process of data migration is mission-critical for data-driven organizations—and data migration testing, doubly so.\n\nBut to understand why, we must first define what data migration testing is, what makes it more important than ever, why manual testing just can’t cut it anymore, and how automation alone may not be enough to keep data-driven organizations in business.\n\nWhat is data migration testing?\n\nData migration testing is a critical process that ensures the successful transfer of different types of data from one system to another. Use cases that benefit from this testing range from simple (ensuring the success of a basic database migration) to complicated (transferring data from a legacy system to modern systems that are compatible with new applications).\n\nIn modern data environments, anything that can go wrong usually tries to. So the process of data migration testing is essential for maintaining data integrity, minimizing disruptions, and ensuring that functional and non-functional requirements are all met when the migration itself is complete.\n\nAs such, data migration testing typically involves three main testing phases:\n\n1. Pre-migration testing: Before the process begins, the testing team aligns on the scope of data that will be moved, performing data mapping between where the data currently resides and its target location. This phase is vital for understanding the data schema of the new system in play, as it allows the team to identify risks and create contingency plans as part of a clear migration plan and strategy.\n\n2. Migration testing: As the digital journey begins, the testing team will monitor the process in real time—sampling and validating the data as it migrates while testing the integration of the target system with other systems. Doing so ensures the data is transferred correctly and any discrepancies are identified.\n\n3. Post-migration testing: Once the migration is complete, the team will compare the data in the target system to its source, confirming that everything has transferred correctly and that optimal data quality was maintained. Additionally, post-migration testing often involves data reconciliation and testing the functionality, performance, and documentation of the system the data migrated to.\n\nThe overall process will utilize a combination of white-box and black-box testing methodologies. At their most basic, white-box testing ensures that the migration logic is correctly implemented, while black-box testing verifies that the migration meets the functional and business requirements. Both are essential aspects of a testing team’s comprehensive data migration testing strategy.\n\nWhy data migration testing is more important than ever\n\nAs more business organizations aspire to be data-driven, more data is created. And all of that data has to migrate—across systems, departments, organizations, and continents. No wonder, then, that data migration testing is becoming mission-critical for modern organizations. And this involves several specific challenges.\n\nIn addition to its ever-increasing volume, the data itself is becoming more complicated. New technologies are emerging. Organizations continue to merge or acquire other companies. Companies themselves are constantly updating and optimizing existing systems. This all creates a dynamic, turbulent landscape that data migration needs to navigate while testing teams work to make sure data losses or corruption don’t occur along the way.\n\nThe rules required to navigate this landscape are growing more complex as well. Stringent data protection regulations, like Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), have increasingly global implications as the infrastructure connecting individuals and businesses around the world grows more sophisticated. Data migration testing processes now help verify that migrated data adheres to these regulations, helping to minimize the risk of non-compliance and potential (very expensive) legal penalties.\n\nOther complications stem from digital transformation initiatives as organizations migrate data to new applications in order to utilize advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning capabilities. Migration testing is also critical as the digital transformation process takes place. Without testing, these initiatives could easily result in disruptions to business operations or irreparable damage to organizational data quality, undermining the desired effects of the initiative itself.\n\nSimilarly, the infrastructures that enable organizations to be data-driven require frequent system upgrades and the ongoing integration of disparate systems. Teams use data migration testing to ensure system compatibility and a seamless flow of data across the organization’s technological ecosystem. This supports the efficient operations, strategic initiatives, and data integrity that being data-driven requires.\n\nGiven these compounding complications, data migration testing is quickly becoming more than just another tool in the data team toolbox. Businesses are embracing migration testing as a critical component of modern organizational strategy—supporting operational excellence, compliance, and strategic decision-making, all of which are essential for staying competitive in today's whipsawing data-driven business environment.\n\nChecking the boxes with data migration testing\n\nWhile data migration testing is employed to help with an increasing variety of data-related issues and concerns, the process used in a testing environment tends to be fairly consistent.\n\nAs part of a data migration testing strategy, these steps can be followed in the form of a checklist:\n\n1. Planning for the pre-migration phase\n\nObjective definition: Always clarify the goals of each data migration, identifying any needs specific to data consolidation, potential system upgrades, or cloud migration, for instance. All relevant stakeholders should be engaged while objectives are being defined. This ensures all business needs are captured and will be accounted for.\n\nSource data analysis: Utilize data profiling tools to assess the quality, volume, and structure of the data that will be migrated.\n\nData cleansing strategy: Plan for deduplication, normalization, and correction of any source data anomalies.\n\nData mapping: Employ data mapping tools to outline field-level transformations and ensure alignment with the target schema. To mitigate risks of misinterpretation or oversight, consider conducting an iterative review and validation of your mapping logic with stakeholders engaged while defining migration objectives.\n\nEstablish KPIs: Define specific, measurable outcomes and related metrics for data quality, migration time, and post-migration system performance.\n\nBackup verification: Once pre-migration planning is complete, implement checksums or hash totals that can be used to verify the completeness and integrity of the backup data.\n\n2. Testing environment setup\n\nProduction environment replication: Use virtualization or cloud environments to mirror the production setup closely.\n\nIsolation measures: Ensure network and access configurations prevent any interference with live environments.\n\nPlan for updates: Consider establishing a process for regularly syncing the test environment with production updates. Doing so reduces risks associated with environmental drift, as testing will always be conducted on the most current setup.\n\n3. Data migration tool configuration\n\nTool selection: Choose migration tools based on compatibility with source and target systems and overall data complexity.\n\nParameter configuration: Set up conversion rules, connection strings, and error handling procedures.\n\n4. Perform a trial migration\n\nPilot testing: Select a representative data subset for trial migrations to identify patterns of errors or issues.\n\nTest iteration: In some cases, iterative trial migrations—increasing volumes of data over time—can help teams understand performance impacts and potential bottlenecks at scale. Establishing specific criteria or thresholds for escalating trial migration volumes can ensure these testing phases are systematic and controlled.\n\n5. Execute the data migration\n\nReal-time monitoring: Employ monitoring tools to track the migration process, focusing on error rates, throughput, and performance metrics.\n\nPreemptive planning: By establishing a rollback or remediation plan, teams can be prepared if unforeseen and significant issues (e.g., data loss or corruption, performance degradation) arise during the migration process.\n\n6. Implement post-migration testing\n\nData integrity and quality checks: Apply SQL queries or scripts to compare source and target datasets for discrepancies. Implement automated data quality tools to assess data accuracy, validity, and consistency post-migration.\n\nData verification and functional testing: Use data verification tools for checksums, record counts, and spot-checking. Conduct end-to-end testing of business processes using the migrated data.\n\nPerformance testing: Leverage performance testing tools to simulate user load and measure response times, throughput, and resource utilization.\n\nSecurity and compliance testing: Utilize data security scanning tools to detect vulnerabilities and ensure encryption, access controls, and audit trails meet compliance standards.\n\nHistorical data validation: It can be advantageous to also make sure historical data remains accurate and accessible once the migration process is complete—especially with regard to reporting and compliance.\n\n7. Conduct a stakeholder review\n\nReview meetings: Organize sessions with IT, business stakeholders, and data users to validate the migration outcomes against objectives. Push for formal acceptance testing conducted by business users to ensure the migrated data will function and support business needs as expected.\n\n8. Perform finalization and cleanup\n\nData reconciliation: Ensure any data changes in the source system during migration are captured and migrated to the target system.\n\nPreservation: Archiving or securely disposing of old data and decommissioning legacy systems can help address post-migration data hygiene and security considerations.\n\n9. Prioritize documentation and reporting\n\nTechnical documentation: Detail the technical aspects of the migration, including data mappings, transformations, and tool configurations. Consider the value of also recording why certain decisions were made in addition to the specifics of what was done, as this can enhance the value of the documentation overall.\n\nLessons learned: Document challenges, solutions, and insights gained for continuous improvement in future migrations. If available, incorporate information and insights gained during the process to an organizational knowledge base to benefit future migrations and overall organization efficiency.\n\n10. Establish post-migration support\n\nIssue tracking system: Establish a mechanism for reporting, tracking, and resolving any post-migration issues.\n\nInvest in migratory success: Whenever possible, a dedicated support team should be established for a defined period post-migration to assist with user queries and issues as data consumers adapt to the new system.\n\nManual migration testing in the modern world: An unnecessary evil\n\nNow that we’ve stepped out a fairly comprehensive, phase-based approach to data migration testing, let’s go ahead and poke the elephant in the room: Manual data migration testing.\n\nLike many trends in software development and IT operations, manual data migration testing was once a labor-intensive process. It still is. However, while manual testing may be leveraged in specific or niche situations (e.g., for custom applications or small-scale migrations), it is and should be eschewed for increasingly potent automated processes and tools.\n\nTo clarify, handling data migration testing manually in increasingly complex and dynamic IT environments introduces several challenges and problems, primarily due to the scale, complexity, and critical nature of the data involved. The manifesting of issues related to manual manual testing processes typically include the following:\n\nResource intensiveness: Manual testing, especially for large datasets, is extremely time-consuming. Each test has to be designed, executed, and verified manually, which slows down the migration timeline significantly. This necessitates skilled personnel spending considerable amounts of time on repetitive tasks, as opposed to higher-value, strategic activities.\n\nHuman error: No one is perfect. So, naturally, manual data migration testing is prone to errors. Intelligent, experienced, well-meaning personnel handling data verification, validation, and comparison can suffer from oversights, inaccuracies, and inconsistencies. This is especially true when dealing with complex data structures and/or large volumes of data.\n\nLimited scalability: As noted before, the volume of data pumping through the hearts of modern organizations is immense. Manual testing processes don’t scale well, as the time and resources they require increase exponentially.\n\nDifficulties in replicating tests: Replication is a vital aspect of comprehensive data testing. When utilizing a manual process, it becomes difficult to conduct and standardize testing efforts across different datasets or migration projects. This lack of standardization, in turn, can lead to variability in testing quality and outcomes.\n\nInadequate coverage: Given the noted resource and time constraints, manual testing often results in insufficient coverage of data and scenarios. In these cases, critical data issues might go undetected because not all cases or data variations can be thoroughly tested.\n\nLack of real-time monitoring: Manual testing processes lack the capability for real-time monitoring and alerting for issues that occur during the migration. Immediate issue detection is critical for avoiding downtime, security issues, and degradation of operational efficiency.\n\nData validation complexity: Validating the accuracy of complex data transformations, relationships, and integrations manually is challenging. Ensuring data integrity and consistency across different systems without automated tools can be nearly impossible for intricate datasets.\n\nInconsistent documentation: Manual testing processes often suffer from inadequate documentation of tests and outcomes, which can hinder troubleshooting, compliance auditing, and future migration efforts.\n\nDelays in feedback: Finally, the comparatively slow nature of manual testing leads to delayed feedback to the development or migration teams. This can extend the duration of migration projects as issues may only be identified late in the process, necessitating rework.\n\nAmplifying data migration testing at scale\n\nData contracts can play a significant role in mitigating or minimizing the potential downsides and complications associated with automated data migration testing using ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools. Here's how data contracts can address some of the challenges:\n\nStandardization and compatibility\n\nData contracts define the structure, format, and other specifications of the data to be migrated, ensuring that all parties involved in the migration process have a clear understanding of the data requirements. This standardization can help prevent data mismatches and compatibility issues between legacy and new systems, which are common challenges in data migration.\n\nData quality and preparation\n\nBy specifying the quality and format of data required for migration, data contracts can help ensure that data is cleaned and prepared before the migration process begins. This proactive approach to data quality can reduce the need for manual intervention to rectify data quality issues, which is a significant advantage when using automated ETL tools.\n\nEfficiency and speed\n\nData contracts can streamline the migration process by clearly defining the data elements and transformations required, allowing for more efficient mapping and processing by ETL tools. This clarity can reduce the time and effort required for initial setup and customization of ETL tools, addressing one of the key considerations when relying on automation for data migration testing.\n\nError checking and debugging\n\nWith clear data contracts in place, automated ETL tools can more effectively perform error checking and debugging. The specifications outlined in data contracts can serve as a benchmark for validating the migrated data, making it easier to identify and resolve issues quickly. This can enhance the reliability of the migration process and reduce the risk of data loss or corruption.\n\nCost considerations\n\nWhile the cost of licensing advanced ETL tools and the need for skilled personnel to operate them can be prohibitive, data contracts can help optimize the use of these tools. By clearly defining the scope and requirements of the migration, data contracts can help ensure that resources are used efficiently, potentially reducing the overall cost of the migration project.\n\nBalancing automation with manual oversight\n\nData contracts support a hybrid approach to data migration testing by delineating areas where automation is most beneficial and where manual oversight is necessary. For instance, they can specify scenarios that require human judgment or domain expertise, ensuring that the strengths of both manual and automated testing are leveraged effectively.\n\nIn short, data contracts serve as a foundational element in the data migration process, providing clear guidelines and specifications that can address many of the challenges associated with using automated ETL tools. By facilitating standardization, improving data quality, enhancing efficiency, and supporting error resolution, data contracts can significantly mitigate the potential downsides of relying solely on automation for data migration testing.\n\nAutomated data migration testing is ideal, but with a data contract? It can be exceptional.\n\nAs the challenges of Big Data continue to compound, automation alone may not be enough for some organizations. That’s why adopting data contracts is a smart way to ensure automated data migration testing can outpace demand.\n\nData contracts, well-drafted and enforced, are the optimal means to maintain this pace—defining the structure, format, and other specifications of the data to be migrated, ensuring that all parties involved in the migration process have a clear understanding of the data requirements."

Insurance carriers got sick of this, and just start dropping people when their roof gets over certain age, or if it's in a certain condition.\n\nSo basically the storm chaser roofers won.  For a lot of carriers you must change your shingle roof every 15 years, regardless of the shape it's in.\n\n#### Comment ID k0gie5d with +29 score by [(Youre10PlyBud, Reddit, 2023-09-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roofing/comments/16hetjg/my_home_insurance_is_dropping_me_because_of/k0gie5d/) (in reply to ID k0fy2wv):\nThey're going beyond roofs in a lot of places.

We made a claim since some of our solar panels took a beating.  Tennis ball-size hail at the speed of gravity will have that effect, if you throw enough ice balls at the panels.  \n\nState Farm sent their people over - they had a team up here since there were a lot of claims.  Looked at our 25-ish year old steel roof and decided it also got damaged in the storm.  Beyond a bunch of dents (builds character) it's functioning fine.  I don't care about the dents - nobody looks at them except us.  \n\nNope.  They're forking out a boatload to do 9,000 sf of steel roof on the house and shop building, along with some siding that could be replaced for a few thousand with labor.  Gutters, too.  And the garden shed that has a steel roof and siding.  The claim amount is just over 1/3 what we paid for the place in 2016.  The roofing contractor - same folks who installed it way back when - says it's functionally fine (even though they have a financial interest in replacing it).  I suppose SF could drop us if we don't make the repairs, so I guess we'll be picking out a new roof color.  \n\nAll we wanted was replacement of the solar panels and a little more for some minor siding damage.\n\n#### Comment ID k0h7i1j with +1 score by [(UpUpWeGo21, Reddit, 2023-09-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roofing/comments/16hetjg/my_home_insurance_is_dropping_me_because_of/k0h7i1j/) (in reply to ID k0ga000):\nI worked on the contractor side and have helped people get a lot of things replaced from storm damages \nLegit damage I've never told anyone to file a claim if they didn't have any damage\nBut the age of the roof doesn't affect it being replaced because of storm damages. \nIn fact it's easier to get those replaced because after a certain point you can't repair without causing more damage so they are forced to replace\n\n### Comment ID k0gcvrq with +2 score by [(code-brown, Reddit, 2023-09-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roofing/comments/16hetjg/my_home_insurance_is_dropping_me_because_of/k0gcvrq/) (in reply to ID k0e9ofu):\nWe are having a new roof installed as I type this for this exact reason.

White area looks newer, likely the area that was replaced, the brown area has plenty of issues present. I have been witnessing insurance carriers dropping people in any hurricane area trying to reduce their exposure in these states. I subcontract to about a dozen carriers on any given year. They are using any excuse in the book, and most of them are as flimsy as this. Your first photo shows lifted shingles all over which is likely related to nail pops. It happens, sometimes a little sometimes a lot. The curling at the eaves is usually do to poor sheathing coverage at the eaves, sometimes due to rot at the eaves, sometimes both. They will assume rot and maintenance issues and drop you. I would replace your back slope, address the sheathing, and get new insurance asap. Insurance with a roof less than 3 years old will be simple. You can lawyer up but realize that it’s throwing good money after bad. Almost every carrier is trying to shrink their exposure. Lawyers suing for everything is why. They will fight for your cause but it’s not a winning one in this case. People think that everything is an insurance claim, lawyers telling them that is sure is… just to get the lawsuit going. Well it’s not, but the consumer protections are too favorable for the consumer which means it’s easy to get a concession from the insurance company. Which is considered a win for the lawyer, and in most states that means the carrier has to pay all lawyer fees. So you may feel you get a win, a new roof slope or get something covered that was related to rot (never covered). You get 2/5/20k in repairs you shouldn’t have, but the Lawyers bill for 20/40/60k and you never see it or know about it. I watch claims for a simple 25k roof replacement hit 100-200k constantly all due to lawyers and PAs. That’s what’s destroying our home rates.  \n\nI’m much more a fan of Canadian insurance methods. They fix your home and you cannot sue. It means they get to focus on fixing correctly and not have to defend against nuisance lawsuits. Contractors fix what’s broken and get paid directly in most cases.\n\n### Comment ID k0f0s5b with +3 score by [(Ghinasucks, Reddit, 2023-09-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roofing/comments/16hetjg/my_home_insurance_is_dropping_me_because_of/k0f0s5b/) (in reply to ID k0e0kgo):\nBingo!\n\n### Comment ID k0ge6d0 with +4 score by [(sbarrio2, Reddit, 2023-09-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roofing/comments/16hetjg/my_home_insurance_is_dropping_me_because_of/k0ge6d0/) (in reply to ID k0e0kgo):\nPublic adjusters, lawyers, and shady contractors are parasites that will be the death of affordable and accessible insurance.

There is zero reason to start with a lawsuit if your repairs are being made in a timely manner. You could replace 10 roofs for the cost of one lawsuit. Standards would be in every consumers favor if your average person stop being sheeple and carriers did right the first time, and lawyers didn’t have the ability to enrich themselves by preying on the ignorant.

My dad had his insurance dropped from his house because is some paint that started to peel in a section of the house that was like 12’ long and a small exterior spall in the concrete footing under the chimney that was about 4” long by less than an inch tall and at the deepest part was about 3/4”. But here is the real kicker all of the insurance companies use the same program so once one puts something in there, they all see that you are being dropped and you can not get coverage from any other company because they pull you up and site the same exact reason you are being dropped as the reason they can not cover you. Furthermore, what you also may have not realized, this may also force you to default on your mortgage. Like auto loans, the home loan is contingent on you having home owners insurance. If they drop you, you will no longer have the insurance and default on the loan. \n\nI think it is a way for the insurance companies to drop a bunch of their cheaper homes that they are covering , and later will cover your home, but as it is and at a much higher rate. Anything breaks, it is on you now, it is not covered under the new policy. But that is just my thought.\n\n## Comment ID k0hby4m with +1 score by [(gassmano, Reddit, 2023-09-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roofing/comments/16hetjg/my_home_insurance_is_dropping_me_because_of/k0hby4m/) (in reply to ID 16hetjg):\nHorizon shingles?\n\n## Comment ID k0hcmun with +1 score by [(jimmy_2_timez, Reddit, 2023-09-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roofing/comments/16hetjg/my_home_insurance_is_dropping_me_because_of/k0hcmun/) (in reply to ID 16hetjg):\nI’m paying $6000/yr for 1800 ft.².

Contractors take then on because it opens the door to sell things to the homeowner that aren't covered by insurance or to upsell the homeowners from whatever is covered.

To me it would be absolutely daft to purchase a metal roof that cost twice as much to just have it tore off 15 years later. So in the long run metal roofs would no longer exist. Nope, people are still dumb enough to buy the metal roofs with the full knowledge it will have to be replaced no matter condition in 15 years.

Its users link content created elsewhere, effectively siphoning value from  \nother sources via its users.\n2. Its users create new content specifically for it, thus profiting of off the  \nfree labour and content made by its users\n\nThis means that Reddit creates no value but exploits its users to generate the  \nvalue that uses to sell advertisements, charge its users for meaningless tokens,  \nsell NFTs, and seek private investment. Reddit relies on volunteer moderation by  \npeople who receive no benefit, not thanks, and definitely no pay. Reddit is  \nprofiting entirely off all of its users doing all of the work from gathering  \nlinks, to making comments, to moderating everything, all for free. Reddit is\nalso going to sell your information, you data, your content to third party AI\ncompanies so that they can train their models on your work, your life, your\ncontent and Reddit can make money from it, all while you see nothing in return.\n\n## Lack of respect for its third party developers\n\nI'm sure everyone at this point is familiar with the API changes putting many  \nthird party application developers out of business. Reddit saw how much money  \nentities like OpenAI and other data scraping firms are making and wants a slice  \nof that pie, and doesn't care who it tramples on in the process. Third party  \ndevelopers have created tools that make the use of Reddit far more appealing and  \nfeasible for so many people, again freely creating value for the company, and  \nit doesn't care that it's killing off these initiatives in order to take some of  \nthe profits it thinks it's entitled to.\n\n## Lack of respect for other cultures\n\nReddit spreads and enforces right wing, libertarian, US values, morals, and  \nethics, forcing other cultures to abandon their own values and adopt American  \nones if they wish to provide free labour and content to a for profit American  \ncorporation. American cultural hegemony is ever present and only made worse by  \ncompanies like Reddit actively forcing their values and social mores upon  \nforeign cultures without any sensitivity or care for local values and customs.  \nMeanwhile they allow reprehensible ideologies to spread through their network  \nunchecked because, while other nations might make such hate and bigotry illegal,  \nReddit holds \"Free Speech\" in the highest regard, but only so long as it doesn't  \noffend their own American sensibilities.\n\n## Lack for respect for the truth\n\nReddit has long been associated with disinformation, conspiracy theories,  \nastroturfing, and many such targeted attacks against the truth. Again protected  \nunder a veil of \"Free Speech\", these harmful lies spread far and wide using  \nReddit as a base. Reddit allows whole deranged communities and power-mad  \nmoderators to enforce their own twisted world-views, allowing them to silence  \ndissenting voices who oppose the radical, and often bigoted, vitriol spewed by  \nthose who fear leaving their own bubbles of conformity and isolation.\n\n## Lack of respect for common decency\n\nReddit is full of hate and bigotry. Many subreddits contain casual exclusion,  \ndiscrimination, insults, homophobia, transphobia, racism, anti-semitism,  \ncolonialism, imperialism, American exceptionalism, and just general edgy hatred.  \nReddit is toxic, it creates, incentivises, and profits off of \"engagement\" and  \n\"high arousal emotions\" which is a polite way of saying \"shouting matches\" and  \n\"fear and hatred\".\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf not for ideological reasons then at least leave Reddit for personal ones. Do  \nYou enjoy endlessly scrolling Reddit? Does constantly refreshing your feed bring  \nyou any joy or pleasure? Does getting into meaningless internet arguments with  \nstrangers on the internet improve your life? Quit Reddit, if only for a few  \nweeks, and see if it improves your life.\n\nI am leaving Reddit for good. I urge you to do so as well.\n\n### Comment ID e98lq6b with +17 score by [(coebruh, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e98lq6b/) (in reply to ID e98kx3o):\nOh, you know we do!\n\n## Comment ID e9816yd with +45 score by [(DeadKittyPool, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e9816yd/) (in reply to ID 9uulai):\nFrankly, I've never felt voting to be all that essential to the process.\n\n### Comment ID e983dk9 with +33 score by [(giaaeron, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e983dk9/) (in reply to ID e9816yd):\nNo kidding, Ford.\n\n#### Comment ID e98rftb with +5 score by [(sumppumpslump, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e98rftb/) (in reply to ID e983dk9):\nHi my name's Gerry and I like movies\n\n## Comment ID e98hwmc with +10 score by [(CannibalRed, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e98hwmc/) (in reply to ID 9uulai):\nIs everyone enjoying their FREE BEER!\n\n## Comment ID e98s9kl with +7 score by [(GolemThe3rd, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e98s9kl/) (in reply to ID 9uulai):\nAccourding to Moores law a computer in the year 3000 should be 2^684.66 times faster than one in 1973 (yes I know this is impossible, but its interesting)\n\n### Comment ID e98zr0z with +5 score by [(UnfetteredThoughts, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e98zr0z/) (in reply to ID e98s9kl):\nShame Moore's Law is breaking down already.\n\n## Comment ID e98tkan with +6 score by [(CheckersSpeech, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e98tkan/) (in reply to ID 9uulai):\nAt any rate, I *certainly* wouldn't harm the child.   \n\n*[Truthoscope goes nuts]*\n\n## Comment ID e98tmub with +6 score by [(CheckersSpeech, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e98tmub/) (in reply to ID 9uulai):\nPuny Human #1, Puny Human #2 ... and Morbo's good friend Richard Nixon!\n\n## Comment ID e98tek8 with +3 score by [(CheckersSpeech, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e98tek8/) (in reply to ID 9uulai):\nNixon's back!

Not entirely unlike Haman, who despite being fully aware of her Newtype abilities rejects the opportunity to connect with Kamille and understand each other.\n\nAs such, I suppose Yazan is for all intents and purpose no different from an Oldtype and by extension cannot use psycommu tech.

And depending on what story you go by prior to him attempting to perform solo rear guard duty against the assembled might of the federation space force he had been shot a few times in the chest and leg. Despite this he managed to put up so much of a fight that they decided that saturation bombardment of his location was better then sending a constant stream of soldiers and ships to their deaths. I can think of no one who was good enough to warrant that response who wasn't piloting a mobile armor or a Gundam. And because of this no one knows whether he actually died or not at Aboa Qu.

But this blog post seriously misrepresents the data by not actually posting what the average during the season is. Let's not forget that before certification, despite them being athletes who still work out, they're full time students and their sport is not conducive to making a lot of money. You also need to be in a surplus to gain significant muscle. \n\nThere is no advantage to being lean during and before certification, your obsession with having a very low body fat for them is kind of weird and given that your job is in S&C, it's kind of amazing that you're not aware that they might be bulking? The post obviously says that if they reach their minimum weight, which many do, the average would be close to 7% which probably isn't the case, necessarily but I'm sure it's still quite low.\n\nMost wrestlers also noticeably become more muscular over their careers and many move up weight classes, Yianni is a good example and didn't move, Myles Martin got huge, and was very lean and smaller as a freshman as well.\n\n\n\n### Comment ID juzhf1g with +1 score by [(ButtPie42069, Reddit, 2023-08-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wrestling/comments/15j46pl/how_fat_are_college_wrestlers/juzhf1g/) (in reply to ID juzbr66):\nSo true\n\n## Comment ID jv17b48 with +2 score by [(REGUED, Reddit, 2023-08-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wrestling/comments/15j46pl/how_fat_are_college_wrestlers/jv17b48/) (in reply to ID 15j46pl):\nActually starting wrestling and martial arts I realized there are plenty of chubby guys out there who kick.

But that was at a volume of a couple million calls per year, with quarterly payments. So, very spendy. Which is a bad idea for Nearmap, since despite being the incumbent giant for so long, their marginal cost in providing the data is low enough they could choose to be quite affordable and expand their customer base, saving money by going self-service to make their product more approachable.

Believe it or not, you need to have a viable and believable plan to use 2-3M for someone to invest.\n\n“That seems counterintuitive! Why would someone want to give me MORE money?”\n\nHaving more cash on hand (in competent hands where there’s a plan to put that money to use) actually derisks the investment. 50k in a company means there’s zero margin for error. If you don’t deliver or make a mistake, that 50k is gone. With 2-3M, you have longer runway to deliver, make mistakes, etc. You also have a budget for marketing and acquiring users, hiring a team, etc, all of which is important. Without that, and only investing 50k, you might have a product but you have no path to finding anyone to use/buy your product, and someone has bet on just one persons ability for deliver it all.\n\n## Comment ID l6y7q7a with +45 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l6y7q7a/) (in reply to ID 1d7bqx2):\n[removed]\n\n### Comment ID l6z6dos with +6 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l6z6dos/) (in reply to ID l6y7q7a):\ni had angels offer 10-20 each. but only after many months of work\n\n#### Comment ID l6zqy8i with +6 score by [(TriggernometryPhD, Reddit, 2024-06-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l6zqy8i/) (in reply to ID l6z6dos):\nThe juice is not worth the squeeze.\n\n## Comment ID l6z04ml with +9 score by [(DancinWithWolves, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l6z04ml/) (in reply to ID 1d7bqx2):\nDepending on your area, you should be able to find a local network of angel investors.

Are the users requesting these features sticking around, or are you thinking they'll start sticking around after you implement the feature? Are they paying customers and, if so, what's the annual customer value?\n\nTons of feature requests coming from users paying $2k/month and continuing to use the product is awesome. Tons of feature requests coming from free users looking at the app and saying \"I'd need X to use this\" is basically worthless: you can implement most of those features and there's a good chance those users likely still won't be willing to pay.\n\nIf you have paying customers and are making $5k-$10k/month, you can likely raise money from something like the Calm Fund or TinySeed even if you aren't seeking venture scale returns.

It comes with many, MANY strings attached. And it’s mostly a one-way door, you can’t (easily) undo it (context: speaking from personal experience - I raised $15M for my first startup, acquired in 2021).\n\nAside from the other possible funding sources that others have mentioned, if you do make the decision to raise from VCs, then asking for 50K is an order of magnitude (or two) off. Either raise a 500K SAFE, or go for a full priced round and ask for a few million.\n\nAgain, this all depends on what sort of traction you actually have.\n\n## Comment ID l6y9d7w with +1 score by [(there-you-run, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l6y9d7w/) (in reply to ID 1d7bqx2):\nFriends and Family.\n\n## Comment ID l6zd07n with +1 score by [(lets-make-deals, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l6zd07n/) (in reply to ID 1d7bqx2):\nAngel Investors $10k - $750k ...

Success of a VC fund is based on the \"power law\" where most companies in the portfolio will fail, but a couple will be a massive successes (e.g. the Facebooks) which will not only offset the other failed companies in the portfolio, but also return outsized gains for the investors of the fund (i.e. LPs). In other words, VCs need to make bets on companies where 1) the company has enough potential to be worth in the billions, and 2) the VC firm has enough invested where they won't be too diluted when (if) that exit event happens.\n\nFor perspective, the startup I joined as the first employee raised a $7M seed round. $50k checks would come from angel investors to fill out the round and bring on advisors.\n\nLike others said, potentially work with a bank or do a family and friends round.

The founders built up demand through content to validate the problem, did 300+ user interviews with leaders in the industry, built the technology at a previous company, then turned that into a community with 8K+ people. In that community, they built up a list of first round design partners to help build out the solution. They did this for a year, just validating the problem and idea, which they were able to go to VCs and raise a round. This is why I was okay being employee one, and even quit my job to join before they officially raised.

      "# [Top 5 Data Lineage Tools (+ How to Choose)](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-lineage-tools)\nThe good news is that business leaders and stakeholders are increasingly seeing the value of data lineage in their organizations. The even better news is that the data lineage tool market offers more options for data teams every year.\n\nAs a whole, the global data catalog market is projected to grow from $878.8 million in 2023 to $4,680.9 million by 2032, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.7% during this period. That’s respectable.\n\nSo, as more data teams enter the market for lineage tools, it’s important to distinguish the apples from the oranges. Much like data lineage itself, knowledge is power when it comes to vetting potential lineage tools.\n\nThat's why we’re showcasing five potentially potent tools for data lineage here, noting the pros, cons, and pricing for each.\n\nData lineage tools: 5 worth considering\n\nGable.ai\n\nGable is a pioneering data contracts platform that's proactively bridging the gap between data producers and consumers. It focuses on proactive data quality management (i.e., shifting data quality left) by implementing data contracts early in the data lifecycle. In doing so, Gable allows teams to draft, define, and enforce data contracts, providing a collaborative environment for software developers, data engineers, and data scientists.\n\nWhile not a traditional data lineage tool, Gable's approach to data contracts offers a unique perspective on lineage. By defining and versioning data contracts, it provides visibility into data origins, transformations, and dependencies, effectively creating a proactive form of lineage tracking that starts at the source of data creation.\n\nPros:\n\nOffers a highly proactive approach to data quality\n\nUniquely able to integrate directly into development workflows\n\nCan also reduce costs and wasted effort by maintaining data integrity early in the process\n\nCons:\n\nAs a relative newcomer, Gable.ai may present a bit of a learning curve compared to other tools listed\n\nPricing: Interested parties should sign up to Gable’s product waitlist to learn more as details become available.\n\nAlation\n\nAlation is a comprehensive data intelligence platform that offers robust data lineage capabilities. It provides automatic table and column-level lineage, along with business lineage featuring metadata overlays. Alation's strength as a lineage tool lies in its advanced visualization capabilities—including end-to-end mini-map previews and data flow filtering.\n\nTogether, these features allow users to trace data from its origin through various transformations to its final use, providing crucial insights for data governance, impact analysis, and regulatory compliance. Alation's lineage capabilities are especially valuable for organizations dealing with complex data ecosystems, as they offer a clear, visual representation of data flows across multiple systems and processes.\n\nPros:\n\nA comprehensive data intelligence solution\n\nOffers advanced visualization capabilities\n\nIntegrates with many data sources\n\nCons:\n\nCan be complex to implement and use\n\nMay also be overkill for organizations with simpler needs\n\n‍\n\nPricing: Alation doesn't publicly disclose pricing. Those interested need to contact sales for a custom quote.\n\nSecoda\n\nSecoda bills itself as a data discovery and documentation platform that emphasizes user-friendliness and automation in its data lineage features. It offers automated data lineage capture and visualization, integrating with a variety of data sources and tools to provide a comprehensive view of data flows.\n\nAs a lineage tool, Secoda stands out for its ability to automatically generate and maintain up-to-date lineage information with a minimal amount of manual input. Its column-level lineage capabilities allow for granular tracking of data transformations, making it easier for organizations to understand data dependencies, troubleshoot issues, and assess the impact of changes across their data ecosystem.\n\nPros:\n\nProvides a user-friendly interface\n\nOffers strong integration capabilities\n\nLineage capture can be automated\n\nCons:\n\nAdvanced features may necessitate a learning curve for some\n\nLike Gable.ai, Scoda is a relatively new player in the market\n\nPricing: At this time Secoda doesn't publicly share pricing information. Curious parties will need to contact sales for a quote.\n\nCollibra\n\nCollibra is a solid data intelligence platform offering a suite of tools for data governance, cataloging, and lineage. Its data lineage capabilities, specifically, provide end-to-end lineage mapping with technical lineage at table, column, and transformation levels.\n\nViewed solely as a lineage tool, Collibra provides data teams with a comprehensive view of data flows across an organization. Its interactive lineage diagrams offer intuitive visual representations of complex data relationships, enabling users to easily trace data origins, understand transformations, and assess the impact of changes.\n\nThis makes Collibra particularly valuable for organizations that need to prioritize data governance, regulatory compliance, and maintain an in-depth understanding of their data landscape.\n\nPros:\n\nViewed as a comprehensive data governance solution\n\nOffers strong data lineage visualization capabilities\n\nVery robust metadata management\n\nCons:\n\nCan be expensive for smaller organizations\n\nComes with a comparatively complex implementation process\n\nPricing: Collibra offers yearly licensing subscriptions:\n\n12-month plan: $170,000\n\n24-month plan: $340,000\n\n36-month plan: $510,000\n\nDbt (data build tool)\n\nKnown primarily as a data transformation tool, dbt does data lineage capabilities. However, said capabilities are more limited compared to other tools featured above. It provides table-level lineage within dbt projects, with column-level lineage available in the dbt Cloud Enterprise tier.\n\nTherefore, when viewed as a potential lineage tool, dbt's strength lies in its native integration with data transformation processes.\n\nDbt does visualize dependencies between models, which helps data teams understand how changes in one part of a data pipeline might affect others.\n\nIts lineage features are more focused on assets managed within dbt projects—making this integration of particular value for organizations already using dbt, as it provides immediate insights into the lineage of transformed data without the need for additional tools.\n\nPros:\n\nNative integration with data transformation processes\n\nOpen-source core with active community\n\nVisualizes dependencies between models\n\nCons:\n\nLimited to dbt-managed assets\n\nFull column-level lineage only available in its Enterprise tier\n\nPricing: dbt offers three subscription tiers:\n\nCore: Free and open-source\n\nCloud Team: Starts at $50 per user per month\n\nCloud Enterprise: Custom pricing, make inquiries to dbt’s sales team\n\nWhy are data lineage tools important?\n\nAs a refresher, know that data lineage tools should increasingly be seen as table-stakes for modern organizations to establish (and reap the multitude of rewards from) robust data governance and management practices.\n\nIt’s these tools that provide the features and functionality that make fostering and maintaining pristine data quality possible.\n\nEnhanced data transparency and visibility\n\nData lineage tools provide a clear and real-time view of how data flows across an organization, enabling stakeholders to gain deeper insights into data usage, dependencies, and transformations.\n\nOft-overlooked, this transparency also contributes to a culture of impactful data-driven decision-making.\n\nImproved data quality and accuracy\n\nAutomated data lineage tools help identify data quality issues by highlighting anomalies, transformations, and potential errors in the lineage. This early detection allows data teams, stewards, and scientists to address issues promptly, ensuring data remains accurate and reliable.\n\nEfficient compliance and auditing\n\nData lineage is essential for regulatory compliance, especially in industries with strict and/or complex data regulations. These tools provide an audit trail demonstrating how data is used and processed, facilitating compliance reporting and audits.\n\nStreamlined data governance\n\nData lineage simplifies data governance by providing a clear understanding of data assets, their ownership, and the impact of made changes. As a result, lineage tools make it easier to enforce data policies and maintain optimal data quality.\n\nFaster troubleshooting and issue resolution\n\nWhen data issues arise, lineage tools enable faster troubleshooting by allowing data professionals to trace problems back to their source, identify root causes, and implement solutions as quickly as possible.\n\nEnhanced data security\n\nData lineage helps organizations identify vulnerabilities in their data pipelines and access controls, allowing for the implementation of robust security measures to safeguard sensitive information.\n\nEffective change management\n\nBy visualizing how data flows are impacted by changes, teams can assess potential risks and make informed decisions during system upgrades or process modifications.\n\nSupport for data-driven decision making\n\nData lineage empowers more people (both data professionals and their data-adjacent peers) to understand and leverage data assets, supporting true data democratization and enabling more informed decision-making throughout the organization.\n\nOperational efficiency\n\nBy automating data mapping and reducing the need for manual impact analysis, data lineage tools can save significant time and resources, enhancing overall operational efficiency.\n\nRisk management\n\nData lineage manages risks associated with data usage, transformations, and access by providing a comprehensive view of data flow and dependencies.\n\nHow to choose the right data lineage tool\n\nSituations, organizational needs, technical capabilities, and lineage tools themselves are all always in flux—so there will never be a one “best” way to go about choosing the right data lineage tool.\n\nThat said, by carefully considering the following factors and aligning them with your organization's specific requirements, you can streamline to process of learning about and comparing tools, ensuring the chosen tool provides the most value and the best fit possible:\n\nDetermine scope and depth of lineage tracking: Look for tools that provide comprehensive lineage at multiple levels—table, column, and row-level lineage. Ensure the tool captures lineage across your entire data ecosystem, not just from limited sources like BI tools.\n\nReview integration capabilities: The tool should integrate well with your existing data stack, including data warehouses, ETL/ELT tools, BI platforms, etc. Check the depth of integrations—some tools may claim to integrate with a platform but only offer surface-level connectivity.\n\nCompare visualization and analysis features: Clear, intuitive visualizations of data lineage are crucial for understanding complex data flows. Look for capabilities like impact analysis, data flow mapping, and the ability to trace data upstream and downstream.\n\nDetermine if automation and metadata collection is necessary: Automated lineage capture reduces manual effort and improves accuracy. The tool should be able to automatically collect and update metadata as your data environment changes.\n\nVet each tool’s ability to scale: Ensure the tool can handle your current data volume and complexity, as well as scale as your data ecosystem grows.\n\nConsider usability and accessibility: The tool should be user-friendly for both technical and non-technical team members. Features like search functionality and collaborative capabilities are valuable.\n\nInquire about compliance and governance support: If regulatory compliance is a concern, look for tools that offer features to support data governance and compliance efforts.\n\nAsses potential performance impact: Consider how the lineage tool might affect the performance of your data systems, especially for large-scale implementations.\n\nWeigh cost against potential ROI: Evaluate the pricing model and ensure it aligns with your budget and expected value from implementing data lineage.\n\nPrioritize future-proofing: Choose a tool that can adapt to evolving data architectures and technologies.\n\nGet a sense of each tool’s support and community: Consider the level of support provided by the vendor and the existence of an active user community for knowledge sharing.\n\nDetermine if complementary features are available: Some tools offer additional features like data quality monitoring or data cataloging that may provide added value.\n\nLooking to shift your lineage left?\n\nAgain, the right data lineage tools can dramatically enhance data governance, transparency, and quality within your organization. But it should now be crystal clear that choosing the right solution is crucial. Whether you're looking to streamline compliance, ensure data accuracy, or improve decision-making, having the right tool in your data stack is non-negotiable.\n\nGable.ai goes beyond traditional lineage solutions by introducing proactive data contracts, which tackle data quality at the source. By implementing Gable.ai's innovative approach, you’ll be setting your team up for long-term success, maintaining data integrity, and reducing costly errors early in the process.\n\nTo learn more about how Gable.ai can empower your organization with next-level data contracts and improve your overall data management strategy, sign up for our product waitlist today.\n\n‍",

      "# [Gable Steveson banks on himself in career switch: From wrestling champ to NFL bid with the Bills by JOHN WAWROW on 2024-06-11](https://apnews.com/article/buffalo-bills-gable-steveson-wrestling-nfl-4a2fc35c86b8c7247cea4bca8fad7263)\nORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) — Gable Steveson thought he achieved the impossible with his stunning last-second takedown of three-time world wrestling champion Geno Petriashvili to win gold at the Tokyo Games.\n\nThree years later, the 24-year-old Steveson is raising the degree of difficulty in approaching his next challenge: Pro football. Having never played a down of football in his life, he is the rawest of NFL rookies in opening his second week of practice with the Buffalo Bills on Tuesday.\n\nIt’s a passion project and a personal challenge for Steveson to see how far he can stretch his athletic abilities. Or, as the two-time national collegiate wrestling champion from Minnesota put it following practice, “Do the impossible.”\n\n“This is definitely a unicorn situation,” Steveson said. “For me to finally push that narrative of you can come from one sport to another: that’s an incredible thing. And I hope people realize this and can see that they can do whatever they want with their lives.”\n\nAt 5-foot-11 and 266 pounds, Steveson’s career change from super heavyweight wrestler to defensive lineman follows a failed bid with World Wrestling Entertainment. After joining the WWE to much fanfare, he was mostly part of its developmental brand, NXT, before being released last month.\n\nSteveson said he was in the midst of moving boxes, when the Bills called, asking him to attend a tryout. He showed enough raw promise for Buffalo to sign him to a standard three-year undrafted rookie contract — conditional on him making the roster.\n\n“The first time I ever put on football cleats was at this tryout,” he said. “I gave it my all, and I wanted the opportunity to show that I could be something. And that’s what this is about.”\n\nOne big factor working in Steveson’s favor is Bills coach Sean McDermott, a two-time high school national wrestling champion growing up in Pennsylvania. And while McDermott went on to pursue football after high school, he’s credited wrestling for helping shape his life.\n\nMcDermott joked to The Associated Press that Steveson has a far deeper grasp of wrestling than he does. What matters is McDermott knowing a lot more about football and being familiar with how wrestling fundamentals — leverage, hand-fighting and foot speed — can translate into football, especially among linemen.\n\nMcDermott has even introduced wrestling terms to help Steveson’s transition, with the toughest part involving learning a playbook.\n\n“In wrestling, we don’t have 10 different directions to go. Here you got to read a pass. You’ve got to read a reach and a base and all those funky words,” he said. “But I came in here just a blank slate and ready to learn. And I’m a week in and I feel like I’m light years ahead.”\n\nAnother adjustment is having to wear a helmet, which proved heavier than Steveson expected.\n\nWhat fascinates him is being on the same team as pass-rusher Von Miller, someone he grew up watching win a Super Bowl with the Denver Broncos.\n\nHis new teammates are equally in wonder of Steveson.\n\n“You talk about being the best at what you do, he is literally the best at what he does,” said defensive tackle Ed Oliver, who has since learned of Steveson’s win over Petriashvili.\n\n“To have a guy of his caliber, just to be around him, from the mental aspect of what it takes to get in that arena when it’s just him and another opponent. He knows what it’s like just having that one-on-one battle,” Oliver said. “He is just learning to play football. I wouldn’t put any expectations on it. I don’t want to. But I think he will be all right though.”\n\nSteveson laughed at the memory of how his mother wouldn’t allow him to play football growing up.\n\n“She was scared. But I said, ‘Mom, you put me in the hardest sport, wrestling,‘” he said. “So when this opportunity arose, she was like, ‘This is all you. You’re a grown man now. Go ahead and do it.’”\n\nThe Bills and Steveson are taking his development one small step at a time.\n\n“If you’re looking all the way to September, you’re not going to get far. I’m looking for the present,” Steveson said.\n\n“I want to give Buffalo my everything. I know the fans out there are going to care about this moment, and all the wrestling fans are going to care about this moment,” he added. “I just want to be that person that, ‘Hey, here’s a guy who’s never done it and he’s going to do it.’ And I believe in myself.”\n\n___",

This expansion aligns with the core strategy of \"Sustain = Smart + Secure,\" enabling clients’ businesses to navigate the AI-First era towards sustainable success.\n\nDr. Chaiyuth Chunnahacha, CEO of G-Able Public Company Limited, stated, “As a SET-listed digital tech giant equipped with technologies and capital, our main aim is to tap into our modern and smart technologies and digital solutions to serve future business needs, secure organizational data, increase profitability, and ensure sustainable growth of our clients in the AI-First era, in alignment with the strategy of 'Sustain = Smart + Secure.'”\n\nIn 2023, GABLE achieved huge success in its initial public offering and SET-listing as G-Able Public Company Limited. This has enhanced its readiness in terms of its capital for investment in its capacity and capabilities in line with its plan to drive strong and sustainable growth. GABLE’s own software platform has served as a key growth engine propelling the Group’s solid business expansion across many segments. The five affiliated companies have been key in generating the Group’s income, using its Value-Added Distribution to further its growth. The Group’s recurring income exceeded one half of the total income, and its backlog portion climbed up to an unprecedented level of over Baht 4.5 billion.\n\nWith its extensive experience of over 35 years in helping businesses gain a competitive edge through technologies, GABLE has seen opportunities to steer its growth by capitalizing on the AI trend that plays an increasingly important role in organizations. All businesses need to develop their systems to become AI-ready organizations. In doing so, Cloud-based IT infrastructures, data analytics systems through big data platforms, and 24-hour cybersecurity systems should be established to ensure that front-office and back-office systems are ready to work synchronously with AI in the future.\n\nApart from the AI trend that is bringing more growth opportunities for GABLE, building ‘Smart Organizations’ through business applications such as human capital management software is another key growth driver because one crucial asset of an organization is “human.” According to Gartner, the HCM market is expected to see an average growth rate over the next three years at 18%. As organizations need to improve their competitiveness through building up a pool of talents, software platforms can help them do so through the use of big data and AI in talent analytics, skill management, and productivity and efficiency enhancement of employees across sections.\n\nGABLE’s 2024 strategy is originated from the adoption of the concept of “Smart + Secure” to ensure clients’ business sustainability. This consists of the following 3 main guidelines: To integrate GABLE’s Enterprise Solutions and Services core business comprising 5 portfolios, namely Data Analytics, Cloud, Cybersecurity, Application Development, and Managed Tech Services, with its IP platforms to support the preparation of AI-ready data and AI-ready security, as higher demands\n\nfor AI and cybersecurity will boost GABLE’s growth.\n\nTo expand the Group’s capabilities through potential business applications in HCM and ERP through partnering with global entities with expertise across various fields and selecting other interesting smart business applications to provide continued support for its clients. To focus on investment in businesses that are aligned with GABLE’s business concept to secure\n\nmore opportunities and satisfying rates of return; and to gain competitive edge by using its funds from its IPO worth around Baht 600 million to propel business growth under the investment framework covering three main areas: Right Product, Right Technology; Win-Win business Synergy; and Right Price, Right Value.\n\nMs. Raveeratana Satchavarodom, Chief Finance & Strategy Officer of G-Able Public Company Limited stated that in 2023, GABLE’s operating income reached Baht 5,338 million, 13% up from 2022. Despite external factors and fluctuations at macro and industrial levels leading to stronger competition, GABLE was able to navigate these challenges, achieving steadfast expansion and double-digit growth rates in income across all segments, including Enterprise Solution, Valued Added Distribution, and Software Platform, from its clients.\n\nMoreover, after its IPO, GABLE was able to generate a gross profit of Baht 1,099 million in 2023, growing 10% year-on-year, or a gross profit margin of 21%, about the same level as last year. GABLE’s net profit for 2023 stayed at Baht 253 million, and the backlog portion reached an all-time high at Baht 4,544 million, up 16% from Q3 of 2023, ready to support future income recognition. The backlog level is set to support future income generation in 2024 of over Baht 2,753 million, accounting for nearly one-half of the target income in 2024. Furthermore, the Company’s opportunities to further grow its business come from\n\nthe accelerated demand for the creation of AI-ready organizations, the need to set up data analytics and cybersecurity, its partnerships in developing business applications, and inorganic investment through M&As.\n\nBy adopting the strategy of “Sustain = Smart + Secure,” in 2024 GABLE will continue to operate its business based on the 3 guidelines, namely Smart Finance, Secure Finance, and Sustain Finance. Smart Finance is to create more financial returns from organic investment and inorganic investment. Secure Finance is to maintain financial discipline through secure operations and secure investment, focusing on sustainable investment within the so-called Investment Framework to ensure secure and sustainable business growth in the long term. And Sustain Finance is to establish sustainable financial growth, including mitigating risks to be within acceptable levels.\n\nThe above strategy will lead to GABLE’s growing backlog and its move towards reaching another all-time high this year at around Baht 4.5-5.5 billion. GABLE will expectedly continue to maintain its gross profit margin at 20-22% with its recurring income of more than 50% of the total income, to support risk management for investors. With its sound financial discipline and available capital of more than Baht 600 million from the IPO along with its capacity and capabilities, GABLE is ready to grow further in line with the upcoming trend in 2024.",
