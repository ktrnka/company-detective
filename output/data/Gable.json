      "# [What is DataOps? What Leaders Need to Know](https://www.gable.ai/blog/dataops)\nSomething interesting is taking place in the world of DataOps right now. A big something. But what’s really interesting is what’s at play behind the scenes.\n\nAccording to our friends at Global Market Insights (GMI), the calculated annual growth rate (CAGR) of the DataOps platform marketplace is projected to grow 22% from 2023 to 2032 (i.e., less than one decade). By comparison, this is potentially 1% more than the much-buzzed-about low-code application marketplace is projected to grow during the same time.\n\nHowever, the factors driving DataOps aren’t quite as clear compared to low-code.\n\nData orchestration capabilities need to keep pace with the growing volume and complexity of Big Data, and this is part of the reason for this exceptional amount of growth. Improving customer service and experience, increasing operational efficiency, and maintaining competitive advantages are ongoing priorities for businesses.\n\nHowever, this near-exponential investment in DataOps may be due to a reckoning between two other causal trends—the increasing business need for real-time data insights and the growing impact of data governance and compliance globally.\n\nTo better understand why, let’s start by breaking down DataOps, covering its core principles, best practices, and implementation challenges within modern organizations.\n\nA basic definition of DataOps\n\nFor those who work in leadership or data-adjacent teams, DataOps is a lot like shifted paradigms—no doubt you’ve heard it mentioned while doing business. However, lacking any direct experience, what exactly DataOps is may be less than clear. Let’s correct this now.\n\nDataOps is short for Data Operations. It is a process-oriented methodology that shares and builds on many characteristics of Agile methodologies, DevOps, and lean manufacturing. Simply, the goal of DataOps is to reduce the cycle time of data analytics. In practice, it does so by streamlining collection from data sources to consumption by data consumers.\n\nBroadly speaking, the DataOps process is driven through an organized emphasis on automation, collaboration, and communication. For good reason, this means DataOps and DevOps cross streams quite often in practice. Both are instrumental in keeping Big Data and business value from being at odds.\n\nWe’ve done our best to compare and contrast both processes elsewhere. But know that exploring the core pillars of DataOps helps clarify the distinct role it plays.\n\nCore principles of modern DataOps\n\nAndy Palmer coined the term \"DataOps\" in 2015, describing it as the intersection of data engineering, data quality, and data integration with a focus on various data professionals in a given organization communicating and collaborating to increase the velocity, reliability, and quality of data analytics.\n\nWhile the concept and practice of DataOps has evolved and expanded beyond Palmer’s definition the core principles that enable professionals to put DataOps into practice remain largely the same:\n\n1. Automation and Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)\n\nThe beating heart of DataOps is automation, which aims to reduce manual efforts related to data validation, integration, and deployment processes.\n\nThis often includes automating data ingestion, testing, monitoring, and deployment within a build/deployment pipeline to ensure both consistency and reliability.\n\n2. Agile and lean methodologies\n\nPractitioners work to streamline data management processes by incorporating agile and lean methodologies.\n\nAgile’s focus on flexibility, continuous improvement, and the delivery of high-quality products in short cycles enables data teams to accelerate experimentation and adaptation based on feedback. Lean methodologies, in turn, guide teams to streamline data pipelines, minimize inefficiencies, and ensure that data delivery remains firmly coupled to business needs.\n\n3. Collaboration and alignment\n\nEffective DataOps encourages a culture of collaboration and alignment among cross-functional teams, which typically includes data engineers, scientists, and business stakeholders.\n\nFostering collaboration in this fashion ensures data products align with business needs and that data analysts can deliver all insights efficiently.\n\n4. Cloud-first and scalable infrastructure\n\nModern DataOps ecosystems should prioritize cloud-based solutions for optimal scalability and flexibility.\n\nThis principle specifically supports distributed data processing and storage, enabling organizations to scale data operations as needed.\n\n5. Highly automated and continuous processes\n\nDataOps ecosystems should feature high levels of automation to manage the scale and scope of enterprise data efficiently and effectively.\n\nIn practice, this often includes automating the cataloging, movement, and organization of data, in addition to testing and releasing processes.\n\n6. Openness and interoperability\n\nAn ecosystem in which DevOps practitioners leverage best-in-class, open-source, and potentially free tools is essential for innovation. The inverse also holds true—DataOps practitioners should avoid reliance on single, proprietary platforms (as opposed to a variety of tools that are easy to integrate and replace).\n\nThis ease of integration should also apply to a broad spectrum of potential data sources (e.g., data lakes, data warehouses) to improve data quality and governance.\n\n7. Data quality and governance\n\nImplementing robust data governance guidelines and practices is essential to ensure high data quality.\n\nAt a minimum, governance should involve data validation, cleaning, and reconciliation processes which can ensure accuracy and reliability throughout the data lifecycle.\n\n8. Ephemeral environments and code reuse\n\nEphemeral environments are temporary by nature, so using them for testing further enhances flexibility and accelerates development. As such, they reduce the risk of conflicts between environments while promoting resource efficiency.\n\nCode reuse helps practitioners maintain consistency, reduce errors, and save time by avoiding duplications of effort. Additionally, containerization encapsulates applications and their dependencies into containers that can run reliably in different computing environments.\n\n9. Monitoring, observability, and customer centricity\n\nDataOps practitioners should prioritize continuous monitoring and observability of data pipelines, ensuring data availability, performance, and security. This is vital for identifying, addressing, and resolving issues as quickly as possible.\n\nWhile DataOps practitioners focus on reducing cycle times for data delivery, enabling faster insights, and improving data-driven decision-making, ultimately everything done must remain rooted in delivering value to the organization’s end-users and customers.\n\nBeing such an elemental aspect of any data practice, it’s also beneficial to explore how other data leaders articulate their core principles of DataOps. For an excellent perspective to which we can compare and contrast the above, we recommend looking at DataKitchen’s seminal DataOps Cookbook (that is, after finishing our own article, here, of course).\n\nDataOps best practices\n\nIf core principles are one side of the DataOps coin, best practices are the other. Without them, no amount of core principles would allow organizations to actively streamline their data management processes, accelerate their insight generation, and (perhaps most fundamentally) improve data quality.\n\nBecause of this, DataOps best practices naturally intertwine with the principles outlined above. But the key best practices are still worth detailing, as they are applicable across industries and organizations:\n\nFoster a collaborative culture\n\nThe existence of departmental silos within organizations is understandable. But they aren’t acceptable. This is why DataOps best practices begin by breaking down obstacles and fostering communication and collaboration between teams—data engineers, data scientists, business users, stakeholders, and operations.\n\nDataOps makes data quality and accessibility a shared responsibility across an organization, which, in turn, sets the stage for all best practices that follow.\n\nAdopt a customer-centric approach\n\nToo often, adopting a customer-centric approach emerges as an afterthought in the practice of DataOps. This borders on being a tragic irony, as the benefits of DataOps itself—enhanced value delivery, promoting agility and responsiveness, driving innovation, fueling trust and loyalty, etc.—can only be fully realized by engaging with end-users to understand their needs, challenges, and desires.\n\nImplement agile methodologies\n\nLook to agile practices like sprints and scrums to manage data projects, allowing for rapid iteration and responses to change. Practitioners can also use Agile approaches to prioritize work based on business needs and value.\n\nHowever, it bears noting that when practitioners seek to leverage Agile as a DataOps best practice, they must ensure its impact is balanced and holistic within the organization. When employed dogmatically, these Agile methodologies can muddle the practice of proper documentation, over-complicate data management, erode data quality for the sake of responsiveness, and potentially introduce security and compliance risks.\n\nFor these reasons, make sure that Agile within your organization is used as part of the overall DataOps solution, not a solution unto itself.\n\nAutomate data pipelines\n\nActively implement CI/CD pipelines in order to automate data integration, testing, deployment, and monitoring processes. In addition to this best practice of reducing manual efforts and errors, CI/CD pipelines help ensure seamless, automated updates and deployments.\n\nEmbrace continuous testing\n\nLeverage automation to test data quality, data integration, and performance throughout the organization’s data lifecycle.\n\nFurthermore, test-driven development (TDD) approaches should be adopted for data-related code and pipelines. TDD encourages earlier issue identification and potential integration issues while contributing to overall data quality.\n\nMake version control ubiquitous\n\nTrack changes and facilitate collaboration by utilizing version control for all data assets—code, configurations, and data modeling, to name a few.\n\nAdditionally, data versioning strategies should be considered to manage changes in datasets. Doing so enables reproducibility and replicability, supports the experimentation and iteration that DataOps champions, and allows organizations to demonstrate the lineage and provenance of their data.\n\nObsessively monitor data quality and performance\n\nThe ability to identify and solution for issues quickly requires the continuous monitoring of pipeline performance and data quality.\n\nEstablishing key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics related to quality is itself key for operationalizing effective monitoring capabilities.\n\nEnsure data security and compliance\n\nData security, privacy, and compliance checks should be embedded through data pipelines to protect sensitive information while helping the organization comply with all relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).\n\nThese compliance checks also require regular reviews, and security practices must be updated to keep pace with ever-evolving threats and regulations.\n\nInvest in scalable and flexible infrastructure\n\nUtilize cloud services and technologies that bolster operational pillars of effective DataOps, scalability, optimal data processing, and organizational flexibility.\n\nIn doing so, data teams should consider adopting data virtualization and containerization capabilities to improve agility and resource efficiency.\n\nLeverage metadata management while planning for growth\n\nWork to implement robust metadata management practices to improve data discoverability, understanding, and governance.\n\nAs part of planning for future (perhaps inevitable) growth, design data architectures and systems to allow for easy adaption and scaling. Use metadata to automate data lineage, data cataloging, and impact analysis.\n\nEmbrace ongoing learning\n\nAs part of laying the foundations for future growth, DataOps initiatives should encourage team members to continually seek out, evaluate, and adopt emerging technologies and practices that will benefit the organization over time.\n\nDataOps is a journey, not a destination. As such, opportunities and areas of improvement should always be identified as part of a culture of testing, learning, and growing.\n\nCommon roadblocks to DataOps implementation (and how data contracts help)\n\nWhether an organization is just getting off the ground or has already experienced some measure of success, DataOps practices may be poorly defined or functionality non-existent. This is also common and commonly attributed to one or a combination of many of the challenges that follow. Fortunately, drafting and implementing a robust data contract can help in all cases.\n\nChange-averse cultures\n\nIt’s not uncommon for progressive thinkers to face resistance from within when trying to inspire a shift towards more collaborative, agile approaches to data management. Reluctance to adopt new processes (even those that are clearly beneficial) in addition to existing departmental silos can hinder DataOps initiatives before they can even begin.\n\nIn these situations, the data contract drafting process can act as a cultural balm, as it necessitates a clear definition of expectations, responsibilities, and roles of all parties involved in data management and usage (not just those directly involved in data analytics). The drafting process also mitigates resistance to new workflows by setting and/or codifying standardized processes all stakeholders must agree upon.\n\nSkill or knowledge deficits\n\nEven a modest implementation of DataOps requires a healthy mix of skills that span data engineering, data science, software development, and operations. Depending on their size or maturity, an organization may lack the diverse skill set and experience needed to integrate these distinct disciplines effectively.\n\nNo data contract is capable of directly addressing gaps in skills and experience. The implementation of data contracts does, however, clarify standards and requirements for data security, access, and quality. As such, they can indirectly guide employee training and development.\n\nInadequate data governance\n\nAs mentioned, effective DataOps relies on the foundation of solid data governance. Therefore, organizations may struggle to implement governance frameworks that are both robust and agile enough to support modern DataOps practices.\n\nData contracts directly support governance within an organization by establishing clear guidelines for data usage, sharing, and management. The framework for compliance and data quality standards established as they’re drafted makes governance more actionable and aligned with ensuing DataOps goals.\n\nComplexities regarding data integration\n\nThe ability to integrate data from a variety of sources presents significant technical challenges, especially in complex or legacy IT environments. This complexity can stall the progress of DataOps implementation by making data pipelines hard to manage or brittle.\n\nConversely, data contracts simplify integration efforts by specifying data interfaces, standards, and formats. This ensures that raw data from any number of sources will be compatible with the organization’s data infrastructure and can be processed and analyzed with optimal efficiency.\n\nPervasive data quality issues\n\nPoor data quality is (unfortunately) a common challenge in the business world, undermining analytics and eroding trust in data-driven decision-making. This can be an open secret too, with employees painfully aware of the issues substandard data is causing while struggling to quantify what exactly is to blame.\n\nThe metrics, validation processes, and remediation steps for non-compliance that data contracts define can make this a non-issue within organizations. This proactive approach (which is always ideal, especially in enterprise data environments) quickly becomes instrumental in maintaining high data quality across the organization.\n\nDifficulties in scaling data operations\n\nFinally, as organizations grow, it’s increasingly challenging to scale data operations efficiently while maintaining data quality. DataOps aims to address scalability issues but, ironically, a lack of foresight and flexibility regarding processes and infrastructure can prevent this from happening.\n\nData contracts circumvent these issues through the guidelines and expectations for data infrastructure, processing capabilities, and performance metrics they crystalize. This ensures that as the volume of data an organization must subsist on grows, systems and processes adapt and scale accordingly.\n\nDrafting an optimal DataOps process\n\nIt’s clear that DataOps functions best at the genetic level of data-driven organizations. It’s also clear that, given such high stakes in the market, business leaders should be doing everything in their power to get their own DataOps right.\n\nAs covered in the last section, data contracts serve as an excellent solution to ensure this happens. That said, the benefits these contracts bring to a data-centric organization extend far beyond DataOps.\n\nFor a quick, digestible, informative primer on data contracts, give Why Data Leaders Opt for Ounces Over Pounds a read.\n\nThis article is part of our blog at Gable.ai — where our goal is to create a shared data culture of collaboration, accountability, quality, and governance.\n\nCurrently, our industry-first approach to drafting and implementing data contracts is in private Beta.",
      "# [About Gable](https://www.gable.ai/about-gable)\nIn 2019, the Gable co-founders: Chad (CEO), Adrian (CTO), and Daniel (Founding Engineer) worked together on the Data Platform team at a late-stage freight tech startup called Convoy. Data was incredibly valuable at Convoy. It drove everything from a central pricing model to dashboards that powered day-to-day business operations. Despite this, data scientists, analysts, and data engineers were constantly dealing with data quality, data governance, and change management issues stemming from issues with upstream source data.\n\nAfter spending time talking to dozens of data teams, the trio realized that the data industry’s approach to managing data at the source was 15 years behind software engineering. Data contracts, integration testing, unit testing, diffs, and monitoring were all sorely lacking outside the Data Warehouse. This caused data quality issues to cascade from upstream sources into the analytical environment spurring an overflow of failed tests and randomly changing data - a problem that made data products fundamentally unscalable. Shortly after, Gable was born, with the mission of creating a data culture of collaboration, accountability, quality, and governance.",
      "# [4 Best Data Producer Practices to Improve Your Data Quality](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-producers)\nData engineering teams and data producers can find it hard to collaborate within an organization for a number of reasons.\n\nPoor data quality is one of them.\n\nFor example, a customer’s address may be recorded incorrectly, which can affect their delivery. Sometimes, there are inconsistent data formats (e.g., inconsistency between two datasets). These issues can make data integration tricky and hamper data analytics. As a consequence, you risk dealing with outages and lose a lot of time that goes into fixing things.\n\nThat’s precisely why you need to gain a thorough understanding of data producers, assess their relationship with data consumers, and follow best practices for data producers to minimize data quality issues and improve your data management.\n\nWho and what are data producers?\n\nA data producer is anything that collects, processes, generates, and stores data that’s relevant to your organization and makes it available for data consumers. This can be a user interface, service, device, system—or human.\n\nData producers serve a key role in data lifecycle as the main source of truth. This information is fed into analysis and decision-making processes. Since data producers often generate unstructured data or raw data, it needs to undergo further processing in order to derive meaningful insights from it.\n\nFor example, a point-of-sale (PoS) system is a data producer for a retail company. It generates raw data in the form of sales transaction records, including customer information, product ID, and purchase details. You can perform processing and analysis on this data via customer segmentation or sales trend analysis to understand consumer buying behavior.\n\nSoftware engineers, on the other hand, are also data producers because they develop and maintain systems and applications that generate large amounts of data. They create transactional databases, message queues like Kafka topics, and other tools that produce data.\n\nData producers vs. data consumers\n\nWhile data producers generate data, a data consumer is an entity that uses it. Data consumers copy this data, perform data transformations on it, or send it to other systems. Some examples of data consumers include marketing automation platforms, BI platforms, data analysts, and data scientists. In the case of data analysts, Python, SQL, and other tools can analyze, transform, or visualize data.\n\nTechnical overview of data producers\n\nConsider an ecommerce website that uses a database to store product information, customer profiles, and transaction records. The website's API serves as the intermediary, enabling seamless communication between the database and the front-end interface. The website provides users with a user-friendly interface to browse products, add items to their cart, and complete purchases.\n\nWhen it comes to data producers, your data follows a unidirectional path. In other words, data only flows upstream or downstream at any given time. In this example, the data follows a unidirectional flow, starting from the database, where product information and customer details are stored. The API then processes this data and delivers it to the front-end interface, allowing users to view product listings, add items to their cart, and make purchases. User interactions with the front-end interface, such as selecting products and completing payments, are returned to the API and then stored in the database.\n\nWhat you should keep in mind is that a data producer can function as a data consumer in a different context. The database functions as the data producer when it generates and stores data for the website. The API is the data consumer when it retrieves the data from the database.\n\nHowever, the API becomes the data producer when the front-end interface (acting as a data consumer) calls it to retrieve data. Similarly, the front-end interface can become a data producer for the customer who is now the data consumer that goes through the information provided on the website.\n\nData producer examples\n\nData producers can consist of any of the following:\n\nSoftware engineers act as data producers when they develop applications or systems that generate data during user interactions.\n\nSales associates contribute as data producers when they record customer interactions and sales transactions into company systems. The data they generate helps to improve customer relationship management and boost sales.\n\nCustomers become data producers by interacting with the company’s platforms via online purchases and social media engagement. Their activities generate valuable data on user preferences, behaviors, and feedback. This data helps to analyze and improve customer experience in the future.\n\nBest practices for data producers\n\nStruggling to maintain standardized data formats and failing to streamline data integration can leave your organization behind the curve and impact your decision-making processes. Data engineering managers should consider the following best practices for data producers to improve data management within their organization.\n\n1. Understand your data sources\n\nYou need to understand your data sources when it comes to data producers. When you assess how the data was created and its context, you can identify potential inaccuracies, biases, or limitations.\n\nFor instance, an automated employee attendance tracking system is a data producer. The system serves as the data producer by generating and recording employee attendance data. Understanding the data source—in this case, a biometric attendance system—allows the office management to identify any potential inaccuracies or limitations. They might recognize that the system may not be able to capture nuanced attendance details, such as the reasons for late arrivals. By reviewing these limitations, office management can implement relevant initiatives such as periodic manual checks to provide more accurate information for data producers.\n\n2. Introduce metadata management\n\nMetadata management provides context and information about the data. It helps data producers understand the structure, meaning, and relationships within a dataset. For instance, data producers, such as customer service agents, need to know how the customer data is organized with the CRM system.\n\nMetadata management includes documenting and categorizing different data types within the CRM system via a data catalog. This can help agents understand whether the data is numerical, textual, or categorical. They can also learn about relationships between different data entities. For example, it can uncover how customer data is linked to past purchases or interactions.\n\n3. Implement data quality assurance\n\nData quality assurance is an ongoing process to ensure data is accurate, reliable, consistent, and relevant. It includes using a wide range of techniques and practices to maintain and improve the quality of data that producers generate. This process involves validating data at the point of entry, identifying and resolving errors within it, and ensuring it remains consistent across different systems throughout the organization.\n\nConsider a financial firm where a transaction monitoring system serves as a data producer. The system generates data on customer transactions, account activities, and financial operations. Implementing data quality assurance in this context includes validating how accurate the transaction data is, ensuring data is standardized and consistent across different accounts, and detecting any potential fraudulent activities. This can be done through real-time transaction monitoring, anomaly detection algorithms, and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance checks.\n\n4. Use a data collaboration management platform\n\nGartner analysts predict that by next year, 50% of businesses will embrace a modern data quality solution.\n\nAfter GitHub was launched in 2008, it quickly became a must-have tool for software development teams throughout the world for companies of all scales. GitHub helped teams to manage and track code effectively in a collaborative environment.\n\nSimilar to how GitHub was highly needed for software teams, there’s a need for a collaboration management tool for data teams. Fortunately, Gable.ai fills this vacuum. Gable.ai can bridge the gap between data producers and data consumers. By introducing data contracts and a data collaboration system, the platform can help to improve data quality, consistency, and communication.\n\nFor example, if you have an order processing system as a data producer and an inventory management system as a data consumer, Gable.ai can create data contracts for them. These contracts define specific data parameters that are required by the inventory system and ensure that the order processing system produces data according to its needs.\n\nRevolutionize the way you communicate data between your data producers and consumers",
      "# [Data Debt: What Is it and How to Avoid It](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-debt)\nAccruing data debt might be the cost of doing business in today's digital economy. But, just like its financial cousin, data debt can cost a business dearly if left unmanaged.\n\nAnd, while the monetary analogy makes for a helpful onramp, it's crucial to appreciate the unique and specific impacts data debt has on organizations. While gaining this appreciation, it's also essential to differentiate data debt from technical debt—an analog that occurs in data engineering and software departments.\n\nData debt, to begin with, refers to shortcuts and compromises made within an organization related to data quality, data architecture, and data management in an effort to accelerate access to data. As opposed to creating immediate issues, data debt accumulates over time and can create significant, long-term challenges that, ironically, \"seem to come out of nowhere.\" And, while a majority of modern business models are susceptible to these effects, data debt is particularly troublesome within organizations for whom accessible, reliable, high-quality data is mission-critical.\n\nAlternatively, for technical debt, the causal decisions often involve hardware and software-related factors. While the \"costs\" associated with correcting technical debt can impact an entire organization, the damage inherent in data debt can be far more insidious.\n\nData is increasingly—if not overwhelmingly—fueling the engines of modern business. Poor data quality, compounded by an accumulation of data debt, compromises data-driven decision-making.\n\nWhat's more, left unchecked, data issues can also lead to operational inefficiencies, hamper scalability, harm customer trust, increase security and compliance risks, and more.\n\nFor these reasons, proactively handling data debt should be considered mission-critical. And the ability to do so hinges on helping stakeholders appreciate the multitude of ways data debt can damage an organization.\n\n13 symptoms that may mean data debt is sinking the ship\n\nIntegration issues: When a company moves to adopt new tools or systems, data debt begins to complicate the integration process, leading to delays, complexity, and errors. This same situation can occur when two companies merge and are forced to reconcile two drastically different data systems.\n\nProject delays: Projects in highly data-dependent departments (e.g., IT and product development) may be the first to slow down, be put on hold, or begin going over budget as teams increasingly deal with inconsistencies or proper data hygiene.\n\nSystem degradation: Data debt can begin to compound data integrity, creating malfunctions, service errors and outages, or even complete system failures.\n\nPoor decision-making: It’s admirable when an organization’s leadership tries to use data to make better decisions. But data debt can begin empowering sub-optimal strategies and actions that cause more harm than good. In this sense, no data truly is better than bad data.\n\nMissed opportunities: As data grows untrustworthy or begins to lag behind real time, leadership will also struggle to capitalize on market trends, competitive intel, or the evolving needs of their own customers.\n\nReduced productivity: Employees who end up (re)cleaning, transforming, and validating data are spending less time on their own tasks. As data debt snowballs, inefficiencies and lessening throughput do as well.\n\nIncreasing operational costs: The constant rework needed to counteract an organization’s growing debt begins increasing direct costs like bringing in more resources to help, and indirect costs related to lost time and effort.\n\nSecurity vulnerabilities: Data debt can begin to erode overall security, leading to lax user access management, inadequate encryption, or outdated data storage protocols that begin exposing the organization to unacceptable amounts of risk.\n\nRegulatory and legal issues: Common debt contributors make it exceptionally difficult to handle user data with the same level of integrity and transparency once limited to a few specific industries, like finance and health care. But, while the scope of who needs to clear regulatory bars has changed, the consequences of failing to do so haven’t, often resulting in severe penalties and/or fines.\n\nDecreasing employee morale: We’ve touched on impacts ranging from projects and processes to workflows and costs. Unfortunately, data debt can also announce itself through the toll it takes on employee wellbeing. Frustration builds as day-to-day employees continually deal with data-related fire drills, leading to low morale and updated LinkedIn accounts.\n\nDissatisfied customers: Ongoing data issues eventually leech out through the walls of the organization as billing mishaps, ineffective customer support, misleading product recommendations, and poor customer experience begin frustrating customers.\n\nBrand reputation damage: The same data quality issues that begin to eat away at customer satisfaction can also harm an organization’s reputation within its industry. This, in turn, puts the screws to customer acquisition and retention.\n\nDulling competitive edge: Companies that manage data effectively generate insights faster, utilize them better, respond to market changes quicker, and not only innovate but do so more rapidly. For organizations drowning in data debt, the exact opposite holds true. And it’s these organizations that, sooner or later, find themselves losing step with competitors.\n\nBest practices for managing data debt\n\nFortunately, despite all the factors that can contribute to data debt within an organization, there is an array of best practices that business leaders can champion to counteract debt’s ability to accrue. Broadly, these best practices can be lumped into three categories: procedural, technological, and cultural. Or, as it’s commonly known in reference to digital transformation, “people, processes, and technologies.”\n\nProcedural best practices\n\nThese best practices begin and end with instituting and supporting a robust data governance framework. To counteract data debt, this framework needs to clearly outline all methodologies, use cases, procedures, and policies related to the data lifecycle.\n\nThe governance framework should be employee-accessible, ensuring individuals at all levels of the organization understand data standards and how they can avoid contributing to poor-quality data. These efforts should also include training and workshops, so the entire organization gets on (and stays on) the same page regarding data management best practices.\n\nAs you develop your governance framework, put a system in place for documenting how data is collected, processed, and stored. Plan to use this system as a foundation for clear data lineage procedures in order to benefit from the ability to trace and map data’s unique journey throughout your organization.\n\nProcedures also need to account for data retention policies, outlining where data should be retained, for how long, and whether it should eventually be archived or deleted entirely. Audit processes should then be put in place so that data is regularly reviewed for consistency, accuracy, and relevance.\n\nTechnological best practices\n\nNext, turn your attention to tools and technology that actively work against data debt. Ideally, this begins by modernizing your data infrastructure. Data should be migrated carefully from any legacy systems to more agile, efficient, and scalable systems. And cloud-based solutions continue to make this increasingly easy to implement.\n\nConsider introducing data integration platforms to keep the merging, cleaning, and integration of data from different sources streamlined over time. Metadata management systems make it easier to manage, store, and access valuable context about data as it flows into, and through, your organization. Use data quality tools and automated data validation so that new data is validated against a specific set of standards, and corrected automatically when those standards aren’t met.\n\nAnd while access to data documentation and context should be widely available, access to the data itself shouldn’t be. By implementing access control tools you can dial in user permissions, ensuring only specified individuals can access and modify data.\n\nCultural best practices\n\nWith proper processes and technologies in place, you must absolutely address the human element inherent in an organization’s data debt.\n\nStart with buy-in from leadership because data quality is everyone’s responsibility. Without executives and stakeholders making this clear, data quality within an organization will rot from the roots up—diligent, day-to-day processes ultimately keep organizational data aligned with the truth. It’s important, then, to ensure top management commits and is ready to take accountability for their organization’s data debt. Leadership will also need to ensure best practices are funded and adopted.\n\nWith leadership behind these efforts, a culture of data ownership can actually be fostered. As employees begin to benefit from data debt mitigation, it will be easier for peers to hold each other accountable for good data management and contributing to data quality.\n\nAs this sense of ownership takes hold, encourage a collaborative environment where departments work together on data projects, as this requires unified standards, promotes data literacy, and breaks down silos.\n\nKeep communication channels open so that your increasingly empowered employees can easily suggest improvements and report data issues as they arise. Comparing and contrasting feedback from different departments can uncover valuable insights. And, finally, actively reward data hygiene.\n\nA natural by-product of these best practices is that the idea of data quality and data debt will become much more tangible. Reinforce this tangibility by recognizing and rewarding teams and individuals who maintain the highest standards of data quality and management.\n\nData contracts: 10 ways better data agreements and specifications are paving a data debt-free future\n\nData contracts can play a pivotal role in minimizing or mitigating data debt. At its core, a data contract is a formal agreement or specification that outlines the format, structure, and semantics of data. They are particularly important when different systems or services interact with one another, ensuring a standardized and expected format of data exchange. Here's how they can help:\n\nStandardization: Data contracts ensure a consistent structure, which means that data from different sources or teams adheres to a unified format. This reduces discrepancies and inconsistencies, a common form of data debt.\n\nValidation: Data contracts can be used as a validation mechanism, ensuring that incoming or outgoing data meets specific criteria or standards before processing. This can prevent inaccurate or corrupt data from entering the system.\n\nDocumentation: A well-defined data contract serves as a form of documentation that’s version controlled, clarifying how data should be structured, what each attribute means, and any constraints on the data. This reduces the chances of misunderstandings or misinterpretations.\n\nInteroperability: As organizations grow, they may integrate multiple systems, tools, or external services. Data contracts ensure seamless integration by setting clear expectations about how data should be sent and received between systems.\n\nReduction in ambiguity: With clear data contracts, there's less guesswork or ambiguity involved in how data should be managed or understood, reducing the risk of errors.\n\nEasier troubleshooting: When issues arise, having a data contract in place makes it easier to pinpoint deviations from the expected data format, speeding up troubleshooting and resolution processes. Contracts also ensure that the correct data owners are contacted based on the specific issues at hand.\n\nSupport for evolution: As data needs change, data contracts can be versioned, allowing for organized transitions and updates. This ensures that even as changes occur, there's a clear record of different data formats and structures over time.\n\nEfficiency in collaboration: When different teams or departments collaborate, having clear data contracts reduces friction and misunderstandings. Everyone knows what to expect, ensuring smoother collaboration.\n\nTransparency and trust: For consumers of the data (which might be internal teams or external partners), a clear contract gives confidence in the data's consistency and quality, fostering trust.\n\nEnhanced compliance: For industries with stringent regulatory requirements around data, having clear data contracts can assist in ensuring compliance by setting and following clear data standards.\n\nTo harness these benefits, it's essential to ensure that data contracts are kept up-to-date, widely accessible to relevant stakeholders, and strictly enforced.\n\nAnd that’s the core principle Gable was designed to address. Join our beta waiting list to be one of the first in your field to learn how data contracts are foundational aspects of a strong data strategy, effectively curbing the accrual of data debt.\n\n‍",
      "# [Data Modeling: Definition, Types, and Challenges](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-modeling)\nServing as a (very real, fully accredited, we swear) 101-level collegiate course, this blog article aims to lay a solid, real-world-based foundation regarding the concept and practice of data modeling.\n\nAs such, the article will include a summary of data modeling’s historical prevalence in data engineering, its more recent dissolution, a definition of the concept, and different methods of use.\n\nWe’ll conclude by exploring why any attempt to discuss the benefits of one type over another consistently equates to booting a hornet’s nest.\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\nThis foundation will serve as a gateway for newer data engineers, function as a juicy target of ridicule for the more seasoned, and will act to foster an appreciation for the role data contracts will play in data modeling’s future.\n\nCourse schedule:\n\nData modeling: An overview\n\nData modeling defined\n\nCommon types of data models\n\nCauses of controversy in the data modeling space\n\nRestoring the model of balance\n\nSuggested next steps\n\n1. Data modeling: An overview\n\nAt one point in the not-too-distant past, data modeling was the cornerstone of any data management strategy. Due to the technical and business practices that were predominant at the end of the 21st century, data modeling at its zenith placed a strong emphasis on structured, well-defined models.\n\nHowever, in the late 2000s, the emergence of major cloud service providers like Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) enabled cloud computing to gain traction within business organizations.\n\nBy the end of that same decade, the benefits of scaleable, on-demand computing resources led to a proper surge within business organizations, which then led to the proliferation of what is now commonly referred to as the modern data stack—a group of cloud-based tools and technologies used for the collection, storage, processing, and analysis of data.\n\nCompared to the at-the-push-of-a-button benefits available on demand, data modeling was then seen by a growing number of practitioners as rigid and inflexible. Data modeling takes time. It can get complicated. The costs and overheads associated with the process reflected this. Perhaps most damaging at the time, it became easy to frame data modeling as a bottleneck—dead weight hampering the speed and flexibility of modern data management.\n\nHowever, this overemphasis on speed and flexibility and the underutilization of data modeling wasn’t sustainable. Though there is no specific “breaking point” to point to, by the mid-2010s, these issues became increasingly attributable to data modeling’s diminution.\n\nWhile far from exhaustive, increasingly common factors helped to precipitate this recalibration in the data space:\n\nData governance challenges: The abundance of cloud-based data storage and processing fueled an explosive increase in the data sources and repositories the average organization had access to. This sudden abundance, in turn, intensified the maintenance of data quality, security, and compliance, irreparably complicating the governance process.\n\nData quality issues: The fevered rate at which cloud-based solutions were adopted resulted in the neglect of data modeling and proper data architecture, resulting in inconsistencies, data quality issues, and difficulties in data integration.\n\nLack of standardization: While cloud environments freed teams to use various tools and platforms, the consistency of data management practices degraded, making it harder to ensure consistency and interoperability across an organization.\n\nScalability and performance issues: Without proper data modeling, it became difficult to optimize systems for performance and scalability. Bottlenecks and reduced system efficiency resulted as data volumes grew.\n\nSecurity and compliance risks: Rapid cloud adoption without adequate attention to data modeling and architecture can expose organizations to security vulnerabilities and compliance risks, especially when dealing with sensitive or regulated data.\n\nDifficulties in extracting value from data: Without a well-thought-out data model, organizations struggle to extract meaningful insights from data. Inevitably, these organizations found that simply having data in the cloud did not guarantee it was inherently usable or valuable for decision-making.\n\n2. Data modeling defined\n\nData modeling is the practice or process of creating a conceptual representation of data objects and the relation between them. Data modeling is comparable to architecture, in that the process blueprints how data is stored, managed, and used within and between systems and databases.\n\nIn essence, there are three key components of data modeling:\n\nEntities: Entities represent the real-world objects or concepts an organization wants to understand better. Examples of data modeling entities include products, employees, and customers.\n\nAttributes: These are the characteristics or properties of the entities being modeled. Attributes provide details that are used to describe and distinguish instances of an entity—product names, prices, customer names, phone numbers, etc.\n\nRelationships: The connections between entities in a data model are called relationships. They can be one-to-one, many-to-many, or one-to-many. Each entity is represented in a relational database in the typical data modeling process. While each entity has a unique identity, it can have multiple instances.\n\nTraditionally, the role of data modeling primarily focused on designing databases for transactional systems and normalizing data to reduce redundancy, improving database performance. The process itself mainly involved working with structured data in relational databases.\n\nModern data modeling is highly varied by comparison. And while its practice and process have evolved beyond some of its inherent qualities viewed negatively in the past, others are now increasingly accepted as trade-offs to be balanced against.\n\nData modeling today caters to a wide range of data storage and processing systems, ranging from traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS) to data lakes and NoSQL databases. Data models now facilitate data integration. They can support advanced analytics, data science initiatives, and predictive modeling. Modern models emphasize agility and scalability to quickly adapt to shifting business requirements.\n\nAs such, data modeling now also supports efforts in the data space to democratize data, helping to make data more understandable and accessible to a wide range of users.\n\n3. Common types of data models\n\nThere are four main types of data models, conceptual, logical, physical, and dimensional. This is true when the goal is to simplify the categorization of data models.\n\nDepending on the business needs of an organization, however, more than these initial four may be considered and utilized. We note the former simply because of the confusion this can sometimes cause within the data space.\n\nConceptual data models\n\nThe purpose of conceptual data models is to establish a macro, business-focused view of an organization’s data structure. Conceptual models are often leveraged in the planning phase of database design or a database management system.\n\nIn these cases, a data architect or modeler may work with business stakeholders and analysts to identify relevant entities, attributes, and relationships using unified modeling language (UML) and entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs).\n\nLogical data modeling\n\nLogical data models work to provide a detailed view of organizational data that is independent of specific technologies and physical considerations. By doing so, logical models are free to focus on capturing business requirements and rules without being biased by technical constraints. As a result, they can provide a clearer understanding of data from a business perspective.\n\nThe ability of less technical stakeholders to more easily understand logical data models also makes them a particularly useful tool for communicating with technical teams.\n\nPhysical data modeling\n\nAlternately, physical data modeling aims to capture and represent the detailed structure and design of a database, taking into account the specific features and constraints of a chosen database management system (DBMS), as well as business requirements for performance, access methods, and storage.\n\nFor this reason, the entities database administrators and developers will focus on include physical aspects of a database—indexes, keys, partitioning, stored procedures and triggers, etc.\n\nDimensional data modeling\n\nFor business intelligence and data warehousing applications, dimensional data modeling is often used. This is because a dimensional model employs an efficient, user-friendly, flexible structure that organizes data into fact tables and dimensions to support fast querying and reporting.\n\nDue to this, dimensional data models can specifically support related applications' complex queries, analysis, and reporting needs.\n\nObject-oriented data modeling\n\nBased on the principles of object-oriented programming, object-oriented data modeling represents data as objects instead of entities. The objects in this type of data modeling encapsulate both data and behavior. This object-oriented approach is key, making object-oriented models highly useful in scenarios where data structures must reflect real-world objects and their relationships.\n\nCommon examples of these scenarios include ecommerce and inventory management systems, banking and financial systems, customer relationship management (CMS) systems, and educational software.\n\nData vault modeling\n\nAs the word “vault” implies, data vault modeling is used in data warehousing, but also in business intelligence. Both data warehousing and BI projects benefit from the historical data preservation, scalability, flexibility, and integration capabilities that data vault models provide.\n\nIn theory, this makes data modeling a potential tool for any organization that needs to integrate data from multiple sources while maintaining data history and lineage (e.g., healthcare organizations, government agencies, and manufacturing companies).\n\nNormalized data modeling\n\nThis type of data modeling focuses on two things—reducing data redundancy and improving data integrity. This can be crucial for transactional systems where data integrity and consistency are of prime importance. Normalized models are easier to maintain and update, while they also prevent data anomalies like inconsistencies and duplication.\n\nDe-normalized data modeling\n\nAlternately, de-normalized data models involve the intentional introduction of redundancies into a dataset in order to improve performance. Through de-normalized modeling, related data can be stored in the same table or document. This reduces the need for computationally expensive join operations, which can slow down query performance.\n\nBecause of how they function, de-normalized data models also harmonize with the principles of NoSQL databases, which prioritize flexibility, scalability, and performance.\n\n4. Causes of controversy in the data modeling space\n\nData scholars agree that discussions around data modeling function similarly to a hornet’s nest in nature—both tend to cause massive amounts of pain when stumbled into. While unfortunate for the stumbler, it helps to understand that, in both cases, damage results in the attempt to defend what one holds dear.\n\nFor hornets, driven to protect the nest’s existing and developing queens, the aggression results from a combination of their innate programming, alarm pheromones, and the instinct to attack in numbers in order to intimidate and dissuade larger foes.\n\nFor data practitioners, however, aggressively defending one’s beliefs about the process and practice of data modeling is usually motivated by one or more of the following factors:\n\nDiverse perspectives: Data modeling is a field that intersects with numerous disciplines, including data science, software engineering, database design, data analytics, and business intelligence. While sharing varying degrees of overlap, these disparate professional backgrounds act as frames through which the views of “effective data modeling” become wildly divergent in the data space.\n\nComplexity and trade-offs: Additionally, data modeling tends to involve near-endless tradeoffs between competing priorities. These tradeoffs include speed vs. governance, normalization vs. performance, and structure vs. flexibility—each with passionate advocates on both sides of the aisle.\n\nOrganizational context: The “right” data model in one organization may not be the same in another, even when operating within the same industry. Differing business rules and goals, data requirements, schema, information systems, and data maturity all but guarantee that there will never be one true data modeling technique or process.\n\nSubjectivity in design: Data modeling itself can be quite subjective. Like many design disciplines, there are often multiple ways to model a given dataset. And data modelers themselves often have legitimate reasons for championing one approach over another. This subjectivity is part of why many find the challenges of data modeling so fulfilling.\n\nEvolving technologies: Despite the order and logic practitioners attempt to bring to the table, the exponentially rapid evolution of data technologies—from traditional relational databases to NoSQL, low and no-code platforms, and big data—necessitates approaches to data modeling to continuously diversify.\n\nFluctuating best practices: Due to the ever-evolving modeling landscape, its related best practices invariably need to change. Techniques once considered sacrosanct can find themselves outdated, furthering debates about what the current best approach may be at any given time.\n\nEmotional Investment: Data practitioners tend to be curious, persistent, analytical thinkers who benefit from a high attention to detail. As such, those who practice data modeling (or cross paths with it) tend to invest a great deal of intellectual and emotional capital in their work. Occasionally, this can create an environment where critiques or suggestions for alternate approaches can either be delivered as a personal attack, or taken as such.\n\n5. Restoring the model of balance\n\nThe good news is that navigating the tension between the impact of data modeling and the convenience of the modern data stack is inevitable. Organizations helping to strike the balance should consider employing the following:\n\nAdopt a hybrid approach: Consider using structured data modeling for core business entities that require consistency and stability above all. In areas that call for more agility and flexibility, employ modern data technologies that enable rapid iteration.\n\nHarmonize flexibility with standardization: Building on a hybrid approach, look to standardize core data elements and processes. At the same time, allow for flexibility in areas where rapid change can be expected. Embrace constant balancing and rebalancing of the strengths of structured data modeling and the modern data stack.\n\nUse iterative data modeling: Instead of insisting on extensive upfront data modeling, try an iterative approach. Start with a basic model, then evolve it as needed. Iteration can produce the best of both worlds, maintaining a structured approach while responding to requirements as they change over time.\n\nLeverage data virtualization: Data visualization provides a helpful layer of abstraction that allows for integrating diverse data sources without extensive modeling. In some organizations, this approach maintains agility while ensuring data is effectively understood and used.\n\nFocus on metadata management: Bridging the gap between structure modeling and agility usually involves a (sometimes renewed) focus on effective metadata management. Robust metadata curation further enables organizational flexibility while clarity regarding data structures and relationships is maintained.\n\nEmphasize data governance: When individuals are empowered to enact consistent data governance, clear policies and standards guiding data quality, usage, and security help ensure a data environment remains as agile as possible.\n\nEnable self-service data access: When implemented with appropriate controls, self-service data access supports agility by allowing users to access data as needed while still operating within the framework of the established data model.\n\nContinuous collaboration: Make sure to foster continuous collaboration between your data architects, engineers, and business users. While the passionate data modeling discussions will still take place from time to time, making cross-disciplinary collaboration an important part of the culture helps keep modeling efforts and business needs aligned.\n\nImplement data contracts: Finally, employ data contracts to provide structured agreements on data formats and interfaces. Their ability to foster communication between data producers and consumers promotes balance just as the other tactics here do—but also allows that balance to scale.\n\n6. Suggested next steps\n\nAs is now abundantly clear, treating data as a product is paramount for any organization looking to succeed in an overwhelmingly data-dependent world. Data contracts are the best way to guarantee the quality of data before it even enters an organization.",
      "# [What is Data Testing? Types, Use Cases, Examples](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-testing)\nData testing isn’t new. However, it is taking on newfound urgency as major trends involving artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, cloud computing, edge computing, and DataOps drive a surge in organizational data consumption.\n\nThis mirrors how trends in global food production led to the rise and prominence of food testing and safety protocols. As our food supply becomes increasingly globalized, tracking, quality assurance, and transparency are paramount. Similarly, in the digital realm, as data is sourced and integrated from diverse global sources, ensuring its quality, reliability, and transparency through rigorous testing becomes crucial.\n\nDoing so ensures that data-driven decisions are based on solid, trustworthy information, just as strict food safety protocols guarantee the food we consume is safe and of high quality.\n\nWhat is data testing?\n\nData testing is the formalized process of validating the accuracy and quality of data within a system. This makes it an increasingly important process as more organizations and industries look to data-driven decision decision-making and real-time analytics to remain competitive.\n\nThe process of testing data involves a combination of techniques and methodologies. Together, they aim to help data teams identify and solve data quality issues that affect its value for data consumers and stakeholders—inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and incomplete data sets.\n\nWhile the specifics vary across organizations and industries, data testing commonly encompasses four main areas:\n\nValidation of data integration processes ensures that data from different sources is accurately merged and transformed.\n\nPerformance testing of databases and data processing applications ensures they meet the required speed, efficiency, and scalability.\n\nSecurity testing safeguards data integrity and privacy, which is especially critical in the context of regulations like GDPR and CCPA.\n\nCompliance testing verifies that data handling practices adhere to relevant legal and industry standards.\n\nDoes all data need to be tested?\n\nData quality is imperative for data-driven organizations. Therefore, data testing in some form or another is now essential. Without it, data teams and consumers within the organization would roll the dice regarding the integrity, accuracy, and reliability of the data pouring into and through the business.\n\nMore specifically, there are 10 key reasons why data testing is essential:\n\nEnsuring data quality: Data testing verifies that the data obtained is correct, complete, and consistent, which is vital for maintaining high data quality standards. High-quality data is essential for accurate analytics and decision-making.\n\nIdentifying coding errors: By testing data, organizations can identify coding errors early in the development process, which saves time and reduces costs associated with fixing issues later on.\n\nSupporting regulatory compliance: Data testing ensures that data management practices comply with relevant standards and regulations, such as GDPR and HIPAA, protecting sensitive information and avoiding legal penalties.\n\nImproving user satisfaction: Accurate and reliable data testing leads to the development of applications that are dependable and of high quality, resulting in increased user satisfaction and trust in the company.\n\nReducing costs: Identifying bugs early through data testing is significantly cheaper than fixing issues discovered after a product release. This represents potential savings for companies and contributes to a better user experience.\n\nFacilitating better decision-making: Reliable data testing ensures that the data used for analytics and informing business strategy is accurate, which is crucial for making informed business decisions.\n\nEnhancing efficiency: By identifying and addressing issues with systems that store and analyze data, data testing improves the efficiency of these systems and processes, leading to better productivity and cost savings.\n\nProtecting data privacy: Data testing plays a crucial role in ensuring data privacy and security by identifying potential vulnerabilities and ensuring that sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access or breaches.\n\nReducing data-related defects: Accurate test data reduces the number of data-related defects or false positives, thereby increasing the efficiency of the testing process.\n\nSupporting Agile and DevOps practices: Proper test data management and testing are essential for supporting modern software development practices like Agile and DevOps, which require regular integration and continuous testing.\n\nHow to determine what you should test\n\nDetermining which data you should test involves a series of steps and considerations to ensure that the test data is representative, relevant, and comprehensive enough to validate the software application effectively. Here are the key steps and best practices for determining the test data:\n\n1. Define clear test data requirements\n\nBefore creating or acquiring test data, it's essential to define the test data requirements that match the scope, objectives, and scenarios of your testing activities. This includes specifying the type, volume, format, and quality of the data needed to test the software effectively.\n\n2. Understand the application's data dependencies\n\nAnalyze the application’s data dependencies, data types, and data sources to select the most appropriate test data. This involves understanding the features, functions, requirements, risks, and assumptions of the software under test.\n\n3. Use activity diagrams to understand code performance\n\nFor Agile practices, activity diagrams are crucial to understanding what specific function a new modification or new piece of code is going to perform. Then, define data to support that use case or set of scenarios.\n\n4. Design a strong data discovery process\n\nA robust data discovery process involves identifying and understanding the data requirements for each test scenario. Proper data discovery helps in selecting the most appropriate test data and ensures that the test environments closely resemble real-world scenarios.\n\n5. Refresh test data regularly\n\nRegularly refreshing test data is essential to maintaining data accuracy and relevance. Outdated or stale data can lead to invalid test results and hinder the identification of critical defects.\n\n6. Employ automation where possible\n\nAutomating Test Data Management tasks can significantly improve efficiency and reduce the risk of errors. Automation tools generate test data, refresh test environments, and anonymize data quickly, enabling testing teams to focus on the actual testing process.\n\n7. Create a review and auditing process\n\nEstablishing a review and auditing process ensures that the test data is accurate, reliable, and complies with data privacy regulations. Regular reviews by designated stakeholders, along with internal audits, help identify any anomalies or data quality issues.\n\n8. Maintain data security\n\nEnsuring that sensitive and confidential data is protected requires implementing data masking, encryption, and access controls. This ensures that only authorized personnel can access and use sensitive data during testing.\n\n9. Manage test data via business entities\n\nInstead of working to understand the complexities of source systems, databases, tables, and columns, testing teams should be able to simply define the business entities for which they need test data.\n\n10. Extract on the fly\n\nEnable the tester, or test data automation tool, to request the data needed to perform a given test, in flight, without any preparation.\n\nData testing methods: When to use each\n\nData testing is a crucial aspect of ensuring data quality and integrity in various applications and systems. Different data testing methods are designed to address specific aspects of data quality and system functionality.\n\nHere's an overview of various data testing methods and the appropriate contexts for their use:\n\nData completeness testing\n\nData completeness testing verifies that all expected data is present and that there are no missing values or records. This method is essential when data migrates from one system to another or when integrating data from multiple sources to ensure that no data is lost in the process.\n\nData accuracy testing\n\nData accuracy testing involves verifying that the data in the system is correct and accurately represents the real-world entities or transactions it is supposed to model. This method is crucial for applications where data precision directly impacts decision-making, financial calculations, or any other critical business processes.\n\nData consistency testing\n\nData consistency testing checks for uniformity in data across different databases, systems, or data stores. It is particularly important in distributed systems or environments where data is replicated across multiple locations to ensure that all copies of the data remain consistent over time.\n\nData integrity testing\n\nData integrity testing ensures that the data remains accurate and consistent as it undergoes operations such as transfer, retrieval, and storage. This method is vital for systems that involve complex transactions or operations that modify the data, ensuring that data relationships and constraints are maintained.\n\nData validation testing\n\nData validation testing verifies that the data meets specific criteria or constraints, such as data types, ranges, and formats. This method is used in scenarios where data is inputted into the system through forms or APIs to ensure that only valid data is accepted and stored.\n\nData transformation testing\n\nData transformation testing involves verifying that data transformation operations, such as aggregations, conversions, and calculations, are performed correctly. This method is crucial in data warehousing and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes where data is transformed before being loaded into the target system.\n\nData migration testing\n\nData migration testing is conducted to ensure that data is accurately migrated from one system to another without loss, corruption, or alteration. This method is essential during system upgrades, platform changes, or when consolidating data from multiple sources into a single repository.\n\nPerformance testing for Big Data\n\nPerformance testing for Big Data involves assessing the system's performance, including data loading speed, data processing speed, and the performance of individual components. This method is critical for applications that process large volumes of data and require high performance to meet user expectations.\n\nRegression testing\n\nRegression testing ensures that new changes, updates, or additions to the system do not adversely affect the existing functionality, including data processing and handling capabilities. This method is used after software updates, bug fixes, or new feature implementations to ensure that the system continues to operate correctly.\n\nEach of these data testing methods addresses specific aspects of data quality and system functionality. The choice of method depends on the particular requirements of the system being tested, the nature of the data, and the specific objectives of the testing process.\n\nConsider testing the idea of data as a product\n\nData testing is a critical component of treating data as a product because it ensures the data product's quality, reliability, and usability. When data is treated as a product, it is developed, managed, and delivered with a high level of care and attention, akin to any other product offering.\n\nThus, our analogy with food isn’t merely playful. We are increasingly recognizing the problems created by prioritizing the availability of food over its quality, and, by extension, its lasting impact on our health.\n\nAs increasingly complex organisms in a digital ecosystem, this helps explain why the movement to treat data as a product is gaining momentum. Competitive advantages are increasingly reliant on the implementation of new tools, data contracts, and other digital transformation initiatives that drive holistic and sustainable data-driven decision-making.\n\nThat said, are you hungry to learn more?

      "# [Data SLAs: Importance, Challenges, and Best Practices](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-sla)\nData leaders, especially those at the VP level, need to understand data service-level agreements (SLAs) like the back of their hand—because mastering these critical contracts allows them to maximize the value of their data investments. This understanding also goes a long way toward fostering trust and accountability across different teams.\n\nHowever, while their underlying concept isn’t inherently complicated, service-level agreements at the enterprise scale can be multifaceted. This is why, from time to time, data leaders must reassess the components of an average SLA, why they matter, challenges that are common to data SLAs, and best practices that data leaders rely on to draft them efficiently and effectively.\n\nHow to define data SLAs\n\nOn a basic level, data SLAs are formal agreements between data producers (or providers) and data consumers. Often, these data providers are external, independent sources of data or vendors, while a given organization will internally house data consumers within differing teams, business units, and departments.\n\nHowever, in some businesses and industries that require a greater reliance on data for decision-making, operations, or compliance—think tech and software development, e-commerce, financial services, and large enterprises—data SLAs can function between data providers and consumers operating within the same organization.\n\nSLAs, whether data-related or not, are also wonderful in the sense that their name succinctly represents exactly what they are: documentation that outlines agreed-upon services—and levels of service—that one party is purchasing from another.\n\nAlthough SLAs drafted as vendor agreements serve as enforceable contracts, not all SLAs are legally binding. For example, data leaders commonly implement internal SLAs as informal agreements instead of legally enforceable contracts.\n\nLegal or not, formal or informal, data SLAs exist to guarantee both access to data from producers and the quality of that data. As such, a data SLA will cover universal data quality metrics: data reliability, accuracy, timeliness, and consistency.\n\nStakeholders tailor data quality requirements to their specific business needs, use cases, and priorities when drafting SLAs. For instance, banks rely on real-time transaction data to detect and deter fraudulent activities.\n\nData leaders in these situations might reasonably draft a data SLA that emphasizes:\n\nTimeliness: “The provider guarantees that transaction data will be processed and made available to the fraud detection system within two seconds of the transaction occurring, excluding scheduled maintenance windows or force majeure events.”\n\nAccuracy: “The provider guarantees an accuracy rate of no less than 99.99% in transaction data, as measured by periodic audits of randomly sampled transactions.”\n\nThis makes sense because in banking, \"data quality\" means real-time availability and near-perfect accuracy, as delays or inaccuracies risk financial losses, reputational damage, or regulatory penalties.\n\nLet’s now switch to the healthcare industry, where data leaders would, of course, value timeliness and accuracy as key factors of healthcare data quality. But when drafting a data SLA, they might instead pay additional time and attention to outlining requirements for:\n\nCompleteness: \"Provider guarantees that critical fields in patient records—such as allergies, current medications, and medical history—will be populated for 100% of patients where such information is available.”\n\nTimeliness: “Updates to patient records—such as new test results or medication changes—are guaranteed to be reflected in the EHR system within five minutes of entry by healthcare staff under normal operating conditions.”\n\nHere, our theoretical data leader emphasizes completeness and timeliness—and rightly so. Incomplete or delayed information could directly jeopardize patient safety and outcomes.\n\nRegardless of industry, data leaders can formalize these agreements through data SLAs to ensure that both providers and consumers understand their roles, responsibilities, and limitations in maintaining reliable and actionable data pipelines.\n\nAs a result, a well-drafted data SLA will increase an organization’s trust in the data they use, hold teams accountable for meeting agreed-upon standards, and set clear expectations that lower data-related risks over time.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean SLAs don’t come with their own set of issues. For those at the leadership level on data teams, it’s wise to pay attention to a few in particular.\n\nCommon (yet critical) data SLA challenges for data leaders\n\nAgreements tend to be easy—until people get involved, that is. Even the simplest SLA can (and usually does) create at least a few issues that data leaders need to handle.\n\nThat said, not all challenges are equally problematic, which is why it’s wise to focus on those that are most common and critical to drafting and implementing data SLAs in most organizations.\n\nAligning realistic performance metrics with business KPIs\n\nWhen data leaders engage service providers, they typically start by addressing key concerns: acceptable downtime (if any), response times for business needs, and data quality issues.\n\nBut data performance metrics represent only half the equation. Data leaders must also ensure that data outlined in the SLA actively supports their organization’s key performance indicators (KPIs).\n\nFailure to solve for all sides here can set data teams up for failure and cause them to overpromise and underdeliver, which leads to SLA breaches and eroded trust. Misaligned metrics also waste resources and force teams to focus on irrelevant or impractical goals. The devil can certainly be in the lack of detail here, as ambiguous definitions such as “timely data” or “high accuracy”) can lead to disputes about compliance.\n\nMaintaining robust communication between teams\n\nPoor or absent communication between data producers, whether they’re external vendors or internal data engineering teams, and data consumers often leads to misaligned expectations regarding SLA deliverables. Technical jargon, unclear documentation, and siloed workflows often exacerbate communication issues.\n\nIn the short term, misunderstandings like these about SLA terms or metrics can lead to disputes over compliance. However, when left to fester, poor SLA-related communication can result in unmet expectations, wasted resources, and strained relationships between teams.\n\nSupporting post-SLA monitoring and compliance\n\nTeams must monitor SLA performance to ensure adherence to agreed-upon standards. Despite near-universal data governance needs, organizations may lack real-time monitoring tools and instead rely on fragmented systems, which obscure SLA compliance.\n\nAs a result, alert fatigue can desensitize teams to critical issues, delay responses, and increase the risk of SLA breaches. Furthermore, weak monitoring strategies often force teams to identify issues only after they’ve disrupted operations or affected stakeholders.\n\nWhile these three SLA-related challenges aren’t inherently complex, data leaders must not underestimate their impact on data teams’ ability to maintain high data quality. Fortunately, following fundamental best practices allows teams to reduce—or even eliminate—these challenges.\n\n7 best practices for effective data SLAs\n\nThese following best practices, though not exhaustive, provide data teams with a solid operational foundation to build on. Each is specific enough to be actionable yet broad enough to be applicable across industries and organizations.\n\n1. Gain key buy-in and champion cross-functional collaboration\n\nInvolve stakeholders from all relevant teams—data engineering, IT, business units, and leadership—as early in the SLA drafting process as possible. This ensures the agreement gains the backing of key decision-makers during the decision-making process. These efforts also ensure the data SLA itself will reflect the diverse perspectives and operational realities of the organization.\n\n2. Keep SLAs in lockstep with business objectives\n\nInformation, insights, and perspectives gained can then ensure data SLAs are drafted in harmony with business objectives, as every SLA should—full-stop. This ensures that the data quality metrics and performance standards defined in the SLA are not arbitrary but instead contribute to measurable business outcomes, such as improving decision-making, customer satisfaction, or regulatory compliance.\n\n3. Define clear, measurable metrics based on those business objectives\n\nClearly articulate key metrics—such as accuracy, timeliness, completeness, and availability—that are specific, measurable, and enforceable. Avoid vague terms like “high-quality data” without defining what that means in quantifiable terms. In most cases, leveraging the SMART Goal methodology will be more than sufficient.\n\n4. Outline specific, realistic expectations\n\nEnsure SLA targets are ambitious yet achievable based on historical performance and current technological capabilities. Unrealistic targets frequently lead to SLA breaches and erode trust between data providers and consumers.\n\nFor help in doing so, analyze past performance data to set achievable benchmarks. For instance, if data pipelines historically operate with 99% uptime, setting a 99.5% target may encourage improvement without overpromising.\n\n5. Implement robust monitoring and reporting\n\nEstablish systems to continuously monitor SLA performance in real time and provide transparent reporting to stakeholders. This includes tracking key metrics like latency or accuracy and generating alerts for potential breaches.\n\nIdeally, use observability tools that integrate with your data pipelines to automate monitoring and generate actionable insights. For example, dashboards showing uptime percentages or error rates can help teams proactively address issues before they escalate.\n\n6. Include flexibility clauses\n\nData SLAs should account for evolving business needs or unforeseen events (e.g., system upgrades or security breaches). Use flexibility clauses to periodically review and adjust the SLA, keeping it relevant over time.\n\nThis can prove crucial, as the data needs of businesses that grow rapidly or adopt new technologies may change substantively. Regularly revisiting SLAs ensures they continue to align with organizational priorities.\n\n7. Establish consequences for non-compliance\n\nFinally, define crystal-clear consequences for failing to meet SLA commitments while ensuring they are fair and constructive. This could include financial penalties for external vendors or escalation protocols for internal teams.\n\nTo help, look to balance accountability with collaboration by focusing on remediation rather than punishment. For example, an internal SLA might require immediate escalation of unresolved issues to leadership rather than imposing penalties.\n\nTaken together, these practices ensure that data SLAs are not just static documents but dynamic tools that foster accountability, improve communication between teams, and drive continuous improvement in data quality and reliability across the organization. They also contribute to a data-centric culture where shifting data left becomes an ever-greater way of getting things right.\n\nService-level agreements as part of data-centric cultures: Building on better data quality practices\n\nIn data-driven organizations, no individual operates in isolation. Yet when it comes to data SLAs, the success of everyone—from the C-suite and stakeholders to data teams and consumers—can rest on a single set of shoulders.\n\nThat’s why those overseeing data quality management must focus upstream to address issues at their source, ensuring that higher-quality data flows freely throughout the organization’s life cycle. Implementing better, more comprehensive SLAs is a strong first step—but the journey shouldn’t end there.",
      "# [What Are Data Contracts? What Leaders Need to Know](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-contracts)\nFounding Father Benjamin Franklin knew a few things about a few things. However, what he couldn’t know is how much one of those things relates to the use of data in our modern age—that it’s far easier to prevent a fire than it is to put one out.\n\nThis insight, the basis of the proverb “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,” came from Franklin’s work to counsel city leaders in 18th-century Philadelphia, helping them deal with particularly hazardous urban fires.\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause Franklin knew what the stakes were. He’d witnessed firsthand how panic and disorganization prevented any response to a blaze from being efficient, coordinated, and effective. And he realized that, when everything around you is on fire, success at best can only be less of a failure.\n\nSo it goes with data, especially with the sheer impact it has on modern business, society, and well, life in general. But here, in our more modern world, Franklin’s favoring ounces over pounds relates squarely to data contracts and the role they play in preventing our need for high-quality data from erupting into flames.\n\nThat said, as vital a role as they’re already playing, data contracts are a newer concept to many, even unheard of by some. So let this article serve as our proverbial Bucket Brigade, raising awareness of the value of data contracts by defining exactly what they are, how they work, and valuable ways they can be used.\n\nWhat is a data contract?\n\nA data contract is a formal agreement between two or more parties that outlines specific terms and conditions of data sharing. These contracts can exist between organizations, systems, or individuals.\n\nWhere traditional contracts exist as written or spoken agreements, data contracts tend to encompass a combination of documents, tools, and artifacts that provide clear specifications, assurances, and systems to monitor and manage the data exchange between parties.\n\nWe now live in a world where the amount of new data created each day, structured by complex data architecture, rests comfortably in the quintillions of bytes. In this world, where business leaders work to enable digital transformation initiatives and more data-driven decision-making, data contracts are proving to be invaluable.\n\nHow do data contacts work?\n\nIn practice, the formal agreement that data contracts represent will marshal the exchange, handling, storage, and usage of data. Contracting parties agree to ensure that any data outlined in the contract is managed accurately and securely, remaining in compliance with relevant regulations.\n\nThese agreements aren’t hypothetical. A contract only works if it can be enforced. This is why data contracts that involve software should be programmatic.\n\nOperationally, contracts will commonly include the following:\n\nSchema definitions: A data contract should explicitly define the schema, including semantics, so the structure of data is clear. As part of a contract, schema definitions may involve specifying which formats, structures (e.g., Avro or JSON), and data types will be used.\n\nValidation rules: These rules make sure all ensuing data adheres to the defined schema and will meet data quality standards the contracting parties require.\n\nAccess control: Data contracts may specify who approved data producers and data consumers will be for the duration of time specified within the contract.\n\nData flow management: Contracts typically outline how datasets should flow between specific systems like data pipelines and data ingestion processes. They may also determine how data should be managed as it moves between contracting parties, such as data engineers and software engineers.\n\nCommunication protocols: API specifications and communication protocols may also be outlined to standardize the data exchange between systems and platforms.\n\nVersioning: Data contracts implement versioning to manage changes made to the data schema. This management ensures that all changes, including breaking changes, will be handled in a way that won’t disrupt existing systems.\n\nDependency and metadata management: To make sure changes don’t negatively impact dependent systems, dependencies between different data entities may also be managed as part of a data contract. Data contracts may also dictate how metadata will be managed and exchanged between systems, ensuring data will be understandable and usable.\n\nCompliance and auditing: Data contracts will ensure that all data exchange and management adhere to legal and compliance requirements. Mechanisms for auditing and tracking data usage and changes can also be specified.\n\nError handling: Finally, as much as data contracts work to make sure things go right, they should also guide responses when things go wrong. Defining how errors and discrepancies in data will be handled ensures that any issues that arise will be logged, addressed, and communicated properly.\n\nEssential aspects of the contract drafting process\n\nHaving defined what a data contract is and what it should typically entail, we can turn to how they’re implemented.\n\nWhile implementation specifics of a data contract will certainly vary from case to case, the blend of technical, organizational, and governance practices will, more or less, consist of the following nine aspects:\n\n1. Objectives and parameters\n\nEffective data contracts begin with defining the landscape in which they’ll operate. At their most basic, these landscapes should include all relevant stakeholders and use cases to which the contract will pertain.\n\nAs part of the stakeholder identification process, it’s important to understand their needs and challenges. Use cases can contain as much or as little detail deemed necessary, but should at least include the specific data requirements of both data producers and data consumers. With this foundational information, the ideal duration of the data contract can also be outlined.\n\n2. Schema design and management\n\nNext, a clear and comprehensive scheme should be defined using formats like YAML, JSON, or Avro to detail data structure, formats, and types. However, know that the data contract does not need to describe the entire data schema. Comprehensive as it relates to data contracts refers to everything that will be useful and can be well-owned.\n\nDoing so ensures schema changes that occur over the course of the contract will not disrupt existing systems. Further, contract parties should align how metadata will be managed to ensure valuable context about data will be accurate and accessible.\n\n3. Data quality assurance\n\nValidation rules can then be established to ensure optimal data quality and consistency. Take email for instance—are we validating that information entered in an email field is actually a real address? Or are we employing value-based validation, ensuring for example that numbers added to an age field are never less than zero?\n\nData quality metrics should also be identified at this time. Doing so ensures all parties agree on how the data quality will be defined, which metrics will be monitored, and the role the data contract will play in ensuring adherence to these standards.\n\nWhile this step may seem straightforward, it shouldn’t be undervalued—especially considering the humbling costs poor data quality enacts on businesses each year.\n\n4. Technical implementation\n\nBased on the constraint, different enforcements of the contract, such as those involving SQL queries, will be needed depending on the technologies used. This makes sense as, for example, the actualities of protecting against NULLS in a database like MySQL will differ from checking value constraints in Kafka.\n\nAPI design should also be accounted for, as needed. If APIs will be used for data exchange, they should be designed to follow GraphQL or RESTful principles, as per requirements.\n\nA format like JSON or Avro will need to be chosen for appropriate data serialization. Plans to implement robust data ingestion mechanisms and data pipelines that will handle data flow also need to be outlined.\n\n5. SLA, security, and compliance\n\nSpecifics regarding data quality, latency, and availability will be clearly defined and minted in the data contract’s SLA. Any service-level agreement will also require monitoring to ensure adherence by all contracting parties. Monitoring and detection pre-deployment here is also essential for identifying any post-implementation issues proactively.\n\nSecurity factors should involve the use of access control mechanisms that will regulate who can produce and consume data. The contract should clearly establish how data management and data exchange will comply with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements. Working in parallel, outlined data governance policies can further guide data management throughout its lifecycle.\n\n6. Communication, error handling, and resolution\n\nData contracts should be authored to facilitate collaboration between data engineers, other data teams, and data consumers affected by the contract. This collaboration relies on clear lines of communication being established and maintained among stakeholders. Moreover, providing as much context as possible bi-directionally helps teams changing the contract understand why constraints are needed while keeping consumers aware of how and when updates are being made.\n\nCommunication is key for managing expectations and providing the right updates at the right time throughout the course of the contract. That said, a data contract should at least include the basics of how productive lines of communication will be established and maintained—and who is responsible for doing so. Error logging and a defined resolution workflow must be established as part of the drafting process. Contract owners should also be alerted if the contract itself is ever violated.\n\n7. Documentation and changes\n\nWhile the contract is being drafted, the formalities of robust documentation and change management must also be captured. While both are important parts of the data contract process, each is its own distinct element. They support the contract by providing clarity and the framework for managing changes and maintaining records.\n\nDocumentation during the course of the data contract should be a clear and clearly accessible chronicle of operating facets of the data contract, including schemas and workflows.\n\nChanges in the data contract or schema should be recorded separately to ensure they can be communicated to stakeholders as needed.\n\n8. Continuous improvement\n\nAs a data contract actively guides the use of data in a given situation, feedback loops need to be established with data consumers and producers. Feedback provides valuable information that can be used to continuously improve how the data contract functions.\n\nFeedback loops also enable contracting parties to adopt an iteration approach to making these improvements, gradually enhancing and refining the data contract as needs evolve.\n\n9. Technology, tooling, and testing\n\nWith the previous aspects defined, appropriate tools and technologies can be chosen to put the contract to work. Automation should be implemented if and when possible in order to streamline the data management and validation processes.\n\nOnce completed, data contracts require thorough testing to ensure they meet all requirements and handle edge cases effectively. This testing should also validate the performance of data exchange mechanisms under various loads and scenarios.\n\nThree use cases for data contracts\n\nFinally, to stitch the why of data contracts together with their respective what and hows, the following three distinct use cases illustrate their importance and application in practice.\n\nReal-time data streaming in financial services\n\nIt’s increasingly common for financial institutions to rely on real-time data streaming—essential for making instantaneous decisions related to trading, fraud detection, and customer service.\n\nBut, with stakes this high, data must be accurate, timely, and reliable. Data discrepancies or delays can cripple decision-making and lead to financial losses.\n\nIn this use case, data contracts provide the following:\n\nAccuracy: The schema that data contracts define can ensure that data is both available and guaranteed to adhere to expected formats.\n\nSLA management: The data contract will ensure that data latency remains within acceptable parameters and selected data sources will be able to provide and process data as needed.\n\nSecurity: The contract will also make sure that sensitive financial data remains secure while transmitted, and that it can only be authorized to approved entities and individuals.\n\nCollaborative data ecosystems in healthcare\n\nHealthcare ecosystems present their own substantial regulatory and privacy concerns, as stakeholders such as doctors, hospitals, insurance companies, and research institutions need to share sensitive patient data to function at their best.\n\nThe challenges here then involve not just data privacy and consistency, but also extensive interoperability required among diverse systems to ensure compliance with regulations like HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act).\n\nIn this use case, data contracts provide the following:\n\nData quality: In this case, the data contract will ensure that data shared among entities will be accurate and reliable—essential for both patient care and research.\n\nData privacy and compliance: Data contracts define how sensitive health data can be handled, which then ensures compliance with regulatory and legal requirements.\n\nInteroperability and dependency management: Data contracts ensure not only the consistency and interoperability necessary in healthcare ecosystems but can also manage dependencies between diverse systems and stakeholders.\n\nSupply chain management in retail\n\nRetailers engage with supply chains that can consist of a huge network of logistics providers, manufacturers, and suppliers. Doing so enables retailers to keep products manufactured, transported, and stocked efficiently.\n\nWith 74% of supply chain leaders reporting increasing their investment in technology and innovation in 2023, the need to guarantee traceability, transparency, and efficiency within retail supply chains increasingly hinges on the availability of consistent, high-quality data.\n\nIn this use case, data contracts provide the following:\n\nData integration: With so many players involved in even basic retail supply chains, data contracts can facilitate the integration of data across all relevant entities, ensuring data is both consistent and accessible.\n\nTransparency and traceability: Data contracts are instrumental in defining data related to product movement, timelines, and quantities. This ensures the complicated journey products take from manufacturer to retailer remains traceable and transparent.\n\nAutomation: Contracts also govern a seamless flow of data across the entire supply chain which, in turn, enables automation and real-time decision-making.\n\nWhat goes around comes around\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of data management, the age-old wisdom of thought leaders like Benjamin Franklin remains strikingly relevant. If “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,” the importance of proactive measures in data handling cannot be overstated.\n\nData contracts, as highlighted in this article, serve as that crucial ounce of prevention, safeguarding businesses from potential pitfalls and ensuring seamless data operations. As we move forward in this digital age, the value of such preventive measures only increases.",
      "# [What is Data Provenance? Importance & Challenges](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-provenance)\nThe amount of data swarming throughout our daily lives increases exponentially. For this reason, data quality is becoming a frequently discussed topic. Bring it on, we say.\n\nBut as data quality (and big data more generally) is discussed more often, it’s imperative that we all understand and employ key terms related to data management and data governance the same way.\n\nData provenance—the term, concept, and practice—should be toward the top of one’s list. For forward-thinking organizations working to improve data quality and use, the provenance of data plays a key role in ensuring the integrity, reliability, and value of all data handled.\n\nWhat is data provenance?\n\nData provenance refers to the information (often metadata) that traces the origin and movement of data throughout the data life cycle. Ideally, this information encompasses the history of specific data—where it came from, the processes and methodologies undergone since origination, and changes of ownership and structure along the way.\n\nThis information is essential for compliance with regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which requires clear data audit trails. Additionally, this information aids in reproducing scientific research, validating experimental results, and managing the ever-increasing complexity and volume of metadata.\n\nIn this way, data provenance is similar to data lineage because the information is essential for ensuring data authenticity, integrity, and reliability. This makes both data lineage and provenance vitally important across industries and applications, from supporting the service quality and operational efficiency of massive telecommunications companies to case-by-case applications in business analytics.\n\nDespite the similarities between data provenance and lineage, they are distinct concepts. What’s more, applying data provenance as a process further distinguishes it from its contextual cousin. So, let’s use an entertaining analogy to ensure we understand how to give provenance its due.\n\nHow are data provenance and data lineage different?\n\nTo help draw a clearer distinction between data provenance and lineage, consider this basic use case:\n\nA business intelligence (BI) team in a large organization needs to generate some reports to aid in executive decision-making.\n\nOne humble data engineer, our hero, compiles relevant customer data (i.e., customer profiles, demographics, shopper behavior) into a dataset and delivers it to the BI team, as requested.\n\nWith the data in hand, the BI team plugs the dataset into a data visualization tool and begins analyzing it, hunting for trends and insights.\n\nLet’s visualize this use case through a cinematic lens (pun intended). The BI team, scouring that customer data for said trends and insights? That’s a movie (you choose the genre).\n\nThis movie has a prequel. That’s data provenance: all the unique backstory, characters, and formative events that, together, made the dataset what it is today. The data provenance here would include all processes and methodologies the data engineer used to collect, cleanse, and transform customer data from multiple data producers pre-delivery.\n\nChances are good that our main movie will also have a sequel or two. Any and all sequels will be data lineage—chronicling the continued adventures of the dataset as the plot and characters flow on and progress through various systems, data consumers, and subsequent use cases.\n\nSo, as different yet equally valuable facets of data management, provenance and lineage help engineers, analysts, auditors, and administrators answer different types of questions.\n\nData provenance answers these questions:\n\nWho created this data, and when?\n\nHow was this data initially collected/generated?\n\nWhat standards and methodologies were used to collect this data?\n\nWhat is the original data source?\n\nData lineage answers these questions:\n\nWhich processes or systems did this data come from?\n\nWhat transformations has this data undergone?\n\nWhere will it go next?\n\nHow will this data be applied in downstream processes and systems?\n\nHow data professionals put data provenance to work\n\n1. Ensuring data integrity and authenticity\n\nIf data is the new oil, data quality is its sweetness (i.e., “sweet crude,” data’s relative value). Data provenance provides a comprehensive history of data that includes sources of the data, changes that were made to it, and who made the changes. This historical record becomes essential for helping teams verify the authenticity and integrity of organizational data. When data quality can be verified, that data can be trusted—applicable for reporting, analysis, and decision-making.\n\n2. Supporting data quality\n\nTherefore, data provenance is intrinsically linked to data quality—providing the context needed for data teams to assess the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of their data. When the history of data is clear, teams can more easily identify the root causes of data issues if, or when, they arise. This reduces the time needed to implement corrective measures, helping to maintain high data quality over time.\n\n3. Facilitating compliance and auditing\n\nIndustries are increasingly subject to data privacy and security regulations that require fastidious data management and record-keeping practices. Data provenance ensures organizations keep data compliant and secure by providing a verifiable trail of its data origins and transformations.\n\nThis makes provenance a key contributor to audit trails—when data teams need to demonstrate compliance with specific regulations and laws, avoiding penalties and damage to organizational reputation.\n\n4. Enhancing transparency and accountability\n\nThe micro to compliance’s macro, day-to-day use and reliance on data requires ongoing transparency and accountability. The audit trail of a piece of data that provenance enables also fosters trust and accessibility among data users and stakeholders, ensuring all parties are confident in the validity of the data used to do their jobs.\n\n5. Improving data security\n\nData provenance allows data teams to make sure the logs they use to track data maintain access and that changes are immutable. As such, these logs can significantly improve cybersecurity. Potential security issues can be quickly identified and responded to, protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access and breaches.\n\n6. Enhancing decision-making\n\nIt borders on the unavoidable; data is, in one way or another, informing most of the critical decisions made in organizations today. Therefore, data teams must guarantee all data used in the decision-making process is reliable and has not been inadvertently altered or tampered with. This goes a long way toward ensuring data is informing, not misinforming, decisions destined to drive business success.\n\n7. Increasing research reproducibility and validity\n\nFinally, among research, analyst, and scientific communities, data provenance is crucial to ensure the reproducibility and validity of studies. Provenance allows researchers to trace the origin of research data, understand any applied methodologies, and evaluate the integrity of their findings.\n\nThis traceability is essential for building robust, verifiable evidence and facilitating peer review and collaboration.\n\nKey characteristics of a well-defined data provenance system\n\nA well-defined data provenance system will be meticulously designed to track data as it is collected, transformed, and used throughout its data life cycle.\n\nWhat follows is a sense of how such systems work in practice and what sets well-defined data provenance systems apart.\n\nComprehensive data capture: Well-defined data provenance systems should automatically log detailed information about the data’s origin, transformations, and states throughout its life cycle. These details should include metadata, system processes, user inputs, and external interactions. Capturing detailed contextual information is key.\n\nData management tool integration: To avoid potential gaps in data tracking, data provenance systems should seamlessly integrate with existing data management systems (e.g., databases, data lakes, ETL tools). Seamless integration ensures all transformations and movements are logged without manual entry.\n\nGranular data tracking: Provenance systems should track data at a granular level, including individual data elements or records. This provides data teams with precise traceability and allows for detailed data history analysis. This is especially important when organizational data needs to undergo complex analysis or auditing.\n\nAutomated workflows for compliance and auditing: To avoid manual or reactive compliance or auditing, well-defined data provenance systems should include automated workflows to generate reports or alerts for anomalies.\n\nData integrity and security measures: These systems implement robust security measures to protect data and its provenance while helping to ensure its integrity. These measures typically include encryption, access controls, and regular integrity checks.\n\nUser-friendly access and visualization: As with other aspects of data management, information from data provenance systems should not be limited to technical users or rely on formats that are hard for stakeholders throughout the company to understand. User-friendly interfaces and visualization tools allow a wide range of professionals to easily access and interpret provenance data, increasing its value organization-wide.\n\nWhy data provenance and prequels both deserve a better script\n\nWhen the stakes are high, whether for data provenance or a movie prequel, script quality becomes vitally important.\n\nIn addition to establishing important story details, settings, and narrative elements, a prequel script needs to address more practical matters—like introducing key characters, budgetary constraints, and high audience expectations.\n\nA well-drafted data contract serves this purpose when relating to data provenance and data management in general. It handles source details, data handling specifications, quality requirements, and regulatory clauses.",
      "# [Data Collaboration: What Working Better Together Really Entails](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-collaboration)\nIt only takes a Google search (or a hot minute or two on LinkedIn) to find a long list of modern data trends:\n\nBig data and the mind-bogglingly explosive volume of it all. Competitive pressures across industries as more organizations endeavor to digitally transform. Machine learning and the use of AI becoming the rule, not the exception. The push towards data democratization. Globalization, distributed teams, and increasingly stringent and complex digital privacy governance and regulations.\n\nActing as a force multiplier, data collaboration can dramatically increase the effectiveness of organizational efforts and systems without the need for additional resources, effort, or investment. That said, there exists an exceptional amount of pressure on data engineers to get data collaboration right within their organizations.\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\nAll of this leads to a central truth: It’s imperative that organizations both understand and embrace what data collaboration is, how it functions to benefit an organization, why data engineers should begin their own collaboration initiatives by looking outside their profession, and best practices that can help facilitate success.\n\nWhat is data collaboration?\n\nData collaboration is the process or practice of sharing, managing, and working on data across different teams, departments, or even entire organizations to achieve common goals in a coordinated and strategic manner. These goals can vary but often relate to an organization wanting to increase data integration to make better decisions, improve personalization and customer experiences, or increase operational efficiency.\n\nBased on these goals, data collaboration may be applied on a case-by-case basis or implemented as a fundamental aspect of how an organization functions. But to fully understand (and appreciate) data collaboration, we must go beyond its technical definition and touch on the complicated interplay it relies upon and enables in data-driven ecosystems.\n\nData sharing, one of the main aspects of data collaboration, will often involve combining datasets (i.e., collections of data) from different departments within an organization and external data producers.\n\nPartnerships between departments and external sources will be unique to an organization, as differing business outcomes may require data sharing with a variety of data sources—suppliers, consultants, customers, research institutions, or other businesses. This diversity is important, as this pooling of resources and knowledge enriches data, leading to better, more comprehensive insights.\n\nApplication programming interfaces (APIs) play a vital role in facilitating the connection and communication between all the differing software applications data providers bring to the table. Workflows ensure data sets are collected, processed, analyzed, and utilized accurately and efficiently. And visualization tools like dashboards play a vital role, enabling data collaborators to more easily monitor, report, and make decisions based on their enriched data.\n\nBut the value data collaboration creates can’t come at the expense of data security. Data access—and stakeholders maintaining control of their data throughout the data collaboration process—is essential. So data teams must stringently manage permissions, controlling access at various levels to ensure these newly created datasets remain compliant and abide by all relevant privacy regulations.\n\nWhile the above only scratches the surface of the complexities involved, it sheds light on the interplay required to successfully implement data collaboration to drive insights, innovation, and improved business performance.\n\nThe benefits of data collaboration\n\nAgain, there are as many potential benefits of data collaboration as ways of using data. In general, within an organization, these typically include better organizational knowledge and skill development, more creativity, innovation, and better cross-functional alignment,\n\nHowever, for an organization's more technical practitioners, beneficial use cases may specifically include the following:\n\nEnhanced data change management processes\n\nRobust data collaboration helps ensure any and all changes to data structures, formats, and usage are systematically recorded, reviewed, and implemented with full visibility.\n\nThe resulting transparency and accessibility facilitates clearer communication among data stakeholders. In this way, data collaboration also improves the traceability of changes and better compliance with data governance standards.\n\nImproved dependency alerting\n\nData collaboration also enables dependency alerting to become more accurate and proactive. In turn, the organization can benefit from earlier identification of potential issues, more agility to respond to changes, and minimized impact of said changes on dependent processes or systems.\n\nHighly collaborative teams may also find it easier to automate alerts that notify relevant data consumers in real time about changes in the data they depend on.\n\nChange request centralization\n\nBusiness environments are increasingly dynamic, meaning that change requests can come from anywhere in the organization (and at any time). Data collaboration also benefits here as it can centralize the process of requesting changes to data or data practices. Further, the requests themselves become more structured and efficient.\n\nChange requests submitted through a centralized platform enable teams to log, prioritize, and address each in a timely manner. Overall, this can make an organization’s data management strategy more adaptive.\n\nFaster detection and response to broken data pipelines\n\nIn addition to consistently producing better solutions, collaborative data analysis can help teams identify issues before they become problems (and fix problems before they create issues). As a result, teams (not just individuals) get better at analyzing and interpreting trends, patterns, correlations, and anomalies related to their data pipelines over time.\n\nThis also means that when a pipeline does break down, the collaborative team is better equipped to drill down into an issue faster, decreasing time-to-resolution.\n\nData models evolve more effectively\n\nData models enjoy enhanced flexibility and scalability thanks to robust data collaboration. This fosters an environment where stakeholder feedback, insights, and emerging needs are better integrated into the evolution of data models.\n\nAdditionally, the improved alignment with business goals and increased ability to leverage new data sources often improves the effectiveness of data-driven initiatives.\n\nImproved potency of data contracts\n\nAs a final benefit of note, while drafting data contracts, highly collaborative organizations enjoy more opportunities to reduce misunderstandings or potential conflicts regarding their data use.\n\nData contracts are drafted, agreed on, and maintained with contributions from all relevant parties. As such, they enter service optimally comprehensive, clear, and aligned with the needs of all stakeholders—facilitating smoother data exchanges and integration efforts.\n\nThe valuable (and somewhat counterintuitive) starting point for successful data collaboration initiatives\n\nMelvin Conway is well-known among software developers for Conway’s Law: “Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.” As noted by the author, speaker, and software developer Martin Fowler, this axiom is important enough “to affect every system [he’s] come across, and powerful enough that you're doomed to defeat if you try to fight it.”\n\nThere’s something immutable to this idea—that the things we make are invariably shaped by the ways we make them—which is why Conway’s Law can, and should, serve as a potent starting point for data engineers to champion data collaboration best practices in their own organizations.\n\nHere’s why:\n\nData engineering often requires an extensive focus on technical proficiency and system optimization. Engineers typically work on specific systems or components within larger organizational architectures.\n\nIn these cases, user experience or user-centric design may naturally take a back seat, while the predominant roles and goals of the data engineer may not include a deep understanding of the broader dynamics at play within an organization, especially how these dynamics pertain to data flow and usage. For engineers looking to head up or bolster a data collaboration initiative, these factors can lead to several blindspots.\n\nRephrased for the context at hand, Conway’s Law could instead read as follows: “In organizations where data engineers are tasked with implementing data collaboration initiatives, the structure and effectiveness of these initiatives will mirror the communication patterns and organizational structures within the company.\"\n\nAs such, embracing our take on Conway’s Law grounds the data engineer in a mindset where cross-functional collaboration needs to be championed in addition to the technical aspects of data systems.\n\nDespite the complexity and time invested in existing projects, the engineer must realize that the organizational change inherent in data collaboration necessitates adaptations in data systems, with an emphasis on flexibility and scalability.\n\nAnd, as part of true collaboration, the pursuit of technical solutions can’t overtake the need for clear data governance structures that both support and mirror the overall communication and decision-making processes of the organization.\n\nWith this important keystone of collaboration in place, data engineers can employ best practices knowing that the foundation they’re building on is immutable as the law that informs it.\n\nBest practices for implementing data collaboration\n\nThere exists a healthy bit of overlap for how best to implement a data process or practice. Since data quality is a foundational requirement for all data activities, it should be viewed and treated as a product, not a commodity. Clear governance and policies need to be established to ensure data is shared and used correctly.\n\nThere are, however, a few best practices specific to successful data collaboration:\n\n1. Encourage cross-functional collaboration\n\nActively break down organizational silos (data silos, departmental silos, etc.) in order to foster collaboration across different departments and teams. Whatever their justification, siloing stifles the diverse data and sources that productive collaboration hinges on.\n\n2. Promote transparency and open communication\n\nWhile important in all areas, everyone involved in data collaboration, be it a project or process, needs to be accountable for promoting transparency and open communication. Build on the clear policies and guidelines established through governance. Establish feedback mechanisms. Recognize and reward openness as data collaboration begins to thrive.\n\n3. Invest in people and processes before tools and technologies\n\nIn data engineering, prioritizing tools and technologies is common. But that doesn’t make it correct. Due to the complexity and scale of data collaboration in organizations, even the tech provides diminishing returns without skilled personnel operating within a robust framework of efficient, adaptable processes. It will be the people and processes that begin to cultivate a culture of collaboration, one where technology serves an organization’s goals (as opposed to dictating them).\n\nFrom Conway to contracts: Why collaborative success hinges on better beginnings\n\nFor those seeking to harness the full potential of their data through data collaboration, the implementation of data contracts inevitably emerges as a pivotal tool. These contracts serve as a blueprint ensuring clarity, consistency, and compliance in the collaborative process, much like architectural plans in building design.\n\nAs we navigate the intricate landscape of data collaboration, the value of well-defined data contracts cannot be overstated. They are the cornerstone of effective data management, enabling organizations to unlock the true power of their data assets.",
      "# [Enhancing Data Visibility for Modern Organizations](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-visibility)\nModern organizations generate and consume astronomical volumes of information every second. While the scale of all this data gets attention, data alone isn’t enough to drive meaningful business outcomes.\n\nEven the most sophisticated data strategies will fall short, if not collapse entirely, when organizations lack clear visibility into where data resides, how it’s accessed, and whether it can be trusted.\n\nBut data visibility isn’t just about access—it’s also about clarity, governance, and real-time monitoring to ensure that business leaders back every critical decision with reliable insights. For modern data teams, it’s about the foundation of operational efficiency, regulatory compliance, and scalable AI initiatives.\n\nThis is why it’s worth the time to break down what data visibility means, why it’s mission-critical, and how organizations can overcome common challenges that stand in the way of making visibility viable.\n\nHow to define data visibility\n\nIn data management, data visibility is a measure of how well an organization’s data users—data teams, stakeholders, and consumers—can access, understand, and monitor data across the organization in real time.\n\nAs a measurement, data visibility is comprehensive, applying to all data, upstream and downstream, throughout the entirety of its lifecycle. As such, teams responsible for measuring organizational data visibility focus on four key facets:\n\nAccessibility: The availability of data to all authorized users at all levels of the organization\n\nTransparency: Data provenance and lineage—how clearly teams can keep tabs on the origins, transformations, destinations, usage patterns, and access logs of all datasets\n\nReal-time monitoring: The ability of teams to continuously track data quality, overall performance, and potential anomalies when they arise\n\nComprehensiveness: The ability of teams to view all data assets across the organization's IT infrastructure—including disparate sources like applications, databases, and servers\n\nIn practice, there is no conclusive scoring or comparison to stages found in other data management measurement practices, like data platform maturity modeling. Instead, data teams measure and optimize data visibility from one moment to the next through the blended use of key metrics, monitoring and measurement tools, audits, and—increasingly—AI and machine learning.\n\nWhy data visibility is mission-critical\n\nFor data leaders, data visibility fuels pure strategic enablement. It also helps those handling data governance track data access and maintain audit trails. The performance metrics visibility initiatives provide make it easier to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies throughout the organization. Additionally, organizations with data visibility optimize resources, mitigate risks, and transform raw data into actionable intelligence.\n\nMoreover, visibility efforts ensure that a business’s need to produce and consume increasingly large volumes of data doesn’t bog down its needs and goals. Therefore, data leadership throughout an organization must stay cognizant of several converging trends and challenges that aren’t just legitimizing the need for high data visibility but also making it an operational necessity.\n\nThe growing democratization of data\n\nData literacy and strong data-centric cultures drive innovation and enhance cross-departmental collaboration within organizations. Data leaders who empower non-technical users with self-service analytics tools foster inclusive environments where data literacy and data-centric cultures thrive.\n\nDemocratization by way of strong data visibility processes ensures that these tools deliver accurate, actionable insights, which helps build trust across the organization.\n\nIncreasing regulatory and compliance requirements\n\nAs data privacy regulations grow more complex and comprehensive over time, organizations must build data supply chains from the ground up to provide data teams with better visibility into all data that will be collected, stored, transformed, and used downstream by data consumers.\n\nThis forms the basis for effective governance frameworks that ensure compliance and stakeholder trust in data quality.\n\nRapidly evolving data security challenges\n\nMuch like regulation and compliance needs, the stakes regarding enterprise cybersecurity are also growing exponentially more complicated. Fortunately, data visibility provides internal teams with a competitive edge against bad actors (be they real or, more often than not, virtual).\n\nReal-time visibility enables teams to identify vulnerabilities, detect anomalies, and swiftly respond to potential threats, like outsiders trying to gain access to organizational data, ransomware, and insider threats.\n\nThis is vitally important from an operational standpoint, as data teams aren’t just working to stay ahead of more security threats; the attacks themselves are growing more sophisticated. It takes a consistent, crystal-clear understanding of where data resides—something data visibility provides—to stay ahead of threats like AI-driven malware and zero-day exploits.\n\nGrowing needs for AI and metadata management\n\nIn contrast to nefarious uses of AI and machine learning, the rise of generative AI is escalating the importance of pristine and visible data across industries. For some organizations, generative AI in particular is already helping them cement competitive advantages over their competition.\n\nHowever, even relatively simple AI initiatives rely on thorough metadata management to provide context, lineage, and datasets that teams can trust explicitly. Without clear visibility into data quality and usage, organizations risk accruing technical debt and severe costs associated with failed AI implementations.\n\nOperational efficiency as needed counterweight during chaotic times\n\nFinally, during times of economic uncertainty like these, business leaders and teams need to do more with less. Organizations with a clear eye on their data can more easily identify inefficiencies, inform demand forecasting, optimize workflows, and maximize enterprise resource planning software effectiveness.\n\nThis alone makes data visibility an emergent cornerstone of business success.\n\nOptimizing data visibility: Common challenges for data leaders\n\nUnderstanding why data visibility is so important to the average organization underscores the need for leaders to tackle common challenges that can actively work against the initiatives and processes that provide it. Data leaders face several challenges that are specific to achieving and, most importantly, maintaining data visibility in modern organizations.\n\nWhile distinct, the challenges we’ve noted here are all rooted in the growing complexity of the average data ecosystem, the growing scale and scope of data operations, and the evolving demands of data consumers.\n\nVolume and complexity\n\nThe sheer scale of modern data operations—combined with the complexity of pipelines involving multiple transformations and dependencies—makes achieving full visibility increasingly difficult. Engineers often lack the resources or infrastructure to manage the tidal volume and scale of organizational data visibility effectively.\n\nResource constraints\n\nIt’s common for data departments to lack the skilled personnel and tools they need to keep pace with the rate at which data ecosystems expand. These budgetary and resource constraints constrict the technical facets that provide data visibility. But these situations also tend to lead to burnout of existing engineering teams, degrading their ability to maintain visibility securely.\n\nFragmented data ecosystems\n\nOften, organizations disperse data across multiple platforms, environments, and systems, creating blind spots that hinder a unified view of data processes. Moreover, this fragmentation complicates monitoring and governance efforts, which leads to inefficiencies and vulnerabilities.\n\nLack of observability tools\n\nUnlike application performance monitoring in software engineering, the observability space for data pipelines remains underdeveloped. As a result, an organization’s data engineers may struggle with limited tools for holistically tracking pipeline health, data quality, and infrastructure performance. Due to this gap, critical issues may go undetected, or data teams may identify them too late, impacting downstream processes and business outcomes.\n\nData siloing\n\nWhile commonly occurring, data leaders can’t underestimate the impact data siloing has on data visibility—as any data silo, by its very definition, prevents seamless data integration and analysis. When left to fester, silos in an organization increase redundancy, reduce overall data quality, and calcify into barriers that muddy the comprehensive understanding of data flows.\n\nDynamic data schemas\n\nWhen facing periods of intense growth or, alternatively, when one organization acquires another, organizations commonly evolve to adopt new data sources and formats. The frequent changes in data schemas that result can disrupt visibility by introducing inconsistencies that are challenging to track—especially for teams that lack automated tools.\n\nDelayed issue detection\n\nIn the absence of real-time monitoring capabilities, teams can identify issues like data quality anomalies or pipeline failures too late. Subsequent delays can, in turn, quickly cascade into significant downstream impacts on decision-making and an organization's overall trust in its data.\n\nStakeholder expectations\n\nFinally, data leaders consistently face pressure to demonstrate value while managing stakeholder demands for faster innovation and delivery. The endless balancing act that results adds complexity to their role, which takes time, energy, and critical oversight away from the teams, tools, and processes that keep data visibility viable.\n\nOvercoming these challenges collectively and successfully over time requires a strong strategic approach. This is why organizations, by implementing a selective set of best practices, can strengthen their data visibility and maximize its value.\n\n9 best practices for setting data visibility initiatives up for success\n\nData leaders can adopt several strategies to improve data visibility within their organizations. These approaches focus on creating a unified, transparent, and accessible data ecosystem while addressing common challenges in managing complex data environments:\n\n1. Champion data literacy\n\nInvest in training programs to improve employees’ understanding of data concepts and tools. A culture of data literacy empowers teams to make informed decisions based on visible and actionable insights.\n\n2. Foster cross-team collaboration\n\nEncourage collaboration between departments by sharing information through dashboards or analytics platforms. Breaking down silos promotes transparency and accelerates problem-solving across teams.\n\n3. Develop a comprehensive data inventory\n\nBegin by cataloging all data assets across the organization, including their location, type, and sensitivity. With unfettered access to their data inventories, leaders can ensure nothing critical gets overlooked—supplementing more effective data management over time.\n\n4. Implement metadata management\n\nUse metadata management systems to track data lineage, transformations, and dependencies. This practice enhances transparency and ensures that stakeholders can understand the origins and flow of data throughout its lifecycle.\n\n5. Adopt unified data platforms\n\nCentralize disparate data sources into a single platform to eliminate silos and provide a single source of truth. Unified platforms streamline access, reduce redundancies, and enable cross-departmental collaboration.\n\n6. Leverage data observability tools\n\nDeploy tools that monitor data quality, freshness, and pipeline performance in real time. Observability platforms help teams detect anomalies proactively, ensuring the timely resolution of issues before they impact business operations.\n\n7. Enhance access management\n\nEstablish robust access controls to balance security with usability. Additionally, endeavor to define roles and permissions that ensure only authorized users can access sensitive data while enabling appropriate access for operational needs.\n\n8. Automate processes with AI and machine learning\n\nUse AI and ML technologies to automate tasks like anomaly detection, trend analysis, and data categorization. These tools enhance efficiency, reduce human error, and provide deeper insights into data patterns.\n\n9. Establish continuous monitoring practices\n\nRegularly monitor data quality and system performance to maintain reliability over time. Automating monitoring processes reduces manual effort while ensuring comprehensive oversight.\n\nEyes forward: Dialing in the focus of organizational data visibility\n\nAchieving strong data visibility isn’t just a one-time initiative—it’s an ongoing process that requires the right strategy, tools, and leadership. Organizations that invest in comprehensive visibility solutions gain a competitive advantage by optimizing workflows, improving decision-making, and ensuring data integrity across all business functions."

Insurance carriers got sick of this, and just start dropping people when their roof gets over certain age, or if it's in a certain condition.\n\nSo basically the storm chaser roofers won.

We made a claim since some of our solar panels took a beating.  Tennis ball-size hail at the speed of gravity will have that effect, if you throw enough ice balls at the panels.  \n\nState Farm sent their people over - they had a team up here since there were a lot of claims.  Looked at our 25-ish year old steel roof and decided it also got damaged in the storm.  Beyond a bunch of dents (builds character) it's functioning fine.  I don't care about the dents - nobody looks at them except us.  \n\nNope.  They're forking out a boatload to do 9,000 sf of steel roof on the house and shop building, along with some siding that could be replaced for a few thousand with labor.  Gutters, too.  And the garden shed that has a steel roof and siding.  The claim amount is just over 1/3 what we paid for the place in 2016.  The roofing contractor - same folks who installed it way back when - says it's functionally fine (even though they have a financial interest in replacing it).  I suppose SF could drop us if we don't make the repairs, so I guess we'll be picking out a new roof color.  \n\nAll we wanted was replacement of the solar panels and a little more for some minor siding damage.\n\n#### Comment ID k0h7i1j with +1 score by [(UpUpWeGo21, Reddit, 2023-09-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roofing/comments/16hetjg/my_home_insurance_is_dropping_me_because_of/k0h7i1j/) (in reply to ID k0ga000):\nI worked on the contractor side and have helped people get a lot of things replaced from storm damages \nLegit damage I've never told anyone to file a claim if they didn't have any damage\nBut the age of the roof doesn't affect it being replaced because of storm damages. \nIn fact it's easier to get those replaced because after a certain point you can't repair without causing more damage so they are forced to replace\n\n### Comment ID k0gcvrq with +2 score by [(code-brown, Reddit, 2023-09-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roofing/comments/16hetjg/my_home_insurance_is_dropping_me_because_of/k0gcvrq/) (in reply to ID k0e9ofu):\nWe are having a new roof installed as I type this for this exact reason.

White area looks newer, likely the area that was replaced, the brown area has plenty of issues present. I have been witnessing insurance carriers dropping people in any hurricane area trying to reduce their exposure in these states. I subcontract to about a dozen carriers on any given year. They are using any excuse in the book, and most of them are as flimsy as this. Your first photo shows lifted shingles all over which is likely related to nail pops. It happens, sometimes a little sometimes a lot. The curling at the eaves is usually do to poor sheathing coverage at the eaves, sometimes due to rot at the eaves, sometimes both. They will assume rot and maintenance issues and drop you. I would replace your back slope, address the sheathing, and get new insurance asap. Insurance with a roof less than 3 years old will be simple. You can lawyer up but realize that it’s throwing good money after bad. Almost every carrier is trying to shrink their exposure. Lawyers suing for everything is why. They will fight for your cause but it’s not a winning one in this case. People think that everything is an insurance claim, lawyers telling them that is sure is… just to get the lawsuit going. Well it’s not, but the consumer protections are too favorable for the consumer which means it’s easy to get a concession from the insurance company. Which is considered a win for the lawyer, and in most states that means the carrier has to pay all lawyer fees. So you may feel you get a win, a new roof slope or get something covered that was related to rot (never covered). You get 2/5/20k in repairs you shouldn’t have, but the Lawyers bill for 20/40/60k and you never see it or know about it. I watch claims for a simple 25k roof replacement hit 100-200k constantly all due to lawyers and PAs. That’s what’s destroying our home rates.  \n\nI’m much more a fan of Canadian insurance methods. They fix your home and you cannot sue. It means they get to focus on fixing correctly and not have to defend against nuisance lawsuits. Contractors fix what’s broken and get paid directly in most cases.\n\n### Comment ID k0f0s5b with +3 score by [(Ghinasucks, Reddit, 2023-09-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roofing/comments/16hetjg/my_home_insurance_is_dropping_me_because_of/k0f0s5b/) (in reply to ID k0e0kgo):\nBingo!\n\n### Comment ID k0ge6d0 with +4 score by [(sbarrio2, Reddit, 2023-09-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roofing/comments/16hetjg/my_home_insurance_is_dropping_me_because_of/k0ge6d0/) (in reply to ID k0e0kgo):\nPublic adjusters, lawyers, and shady contractors are parasites that will be the death of affordable and accessible insurance.

There is zero reason to start with a lawsuit if your repairs are being made in a timely manner. You could replace 10 roofs for the cost of one lawsuit. Standards would be in every consumers favor if your average person stop being sheeple and carriers did right the first time, and lawyers didn’t have the ability to enrich themselves by preying on the ignorant.

Fuck the insurance companies feeding off their old and loyal custpmers\n\n### Comment ID k0hwf3d with +1 score by [(robie50, Reddit, 2023-09-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roofing/comments/16hetjg/my_home_insurance_is_dropping_me_because_of/k0hwf3d/) (in reply to ID k0hw82f):\nTo edit- the “aerial” inspection was done in March, but they didn’t let her know until august, that she had less than 2 months to get her roof replaced or they would drop her coverage.

Also, there's no requirement the company give time to replace. Renewal notices are heavily regulated in the number of days mailing notice they must give prior to the upcoming renewal date.  Assuming they met that, they're good.\n\nWhat the OP should be doing right now is get serious about replacing the roof and call the company to see if they'd renew with a new roof. If so, get a new roof. One is needed anyways: that slope is in piss-poor, decrepit condition.  That roof is either already leaking or will leak very soon.  Guaranteed if not replaced the OP won't be able to find another carrier, especially when they find out the policy was nonrenewed and why.\n\nAn insurance policy is not a maintenance contract.

My dad had his insurance dropped from his house because is some paint that started to peel in a section of the house that was like 12’ long and a small exterior spall in the concrete footing under the chimney that was about 4” long by less than an inch tall and at the deepest part was about 3/4”. But here is the real kicker all of the insurance companies use the same program so once one puts something in there, they all see that you are being dropped and you can not get coverage from any other company because they pull you up and site the same exact reason you are being dropped as the reason they can not cover you. Furthermore, what you also may have not realized, this may also force you to default on your mortgage. Like auto loans, the home loan is contingent on you having home owners insurance. If they drop you, you will no longer have the insurance and default on the loan. \n\nI think it is a way for the insurance companies to drop a bunch of their cheaper homes that they are covering , and later will cover your home, but as it is and at a much higher rate.

Contractors take then on because it opens the door to sell things to the homeowner that aren't covered by insurance or to upsell the homeowners from whatever is covered. It's quite possible that the contractor they hired saw that the roof was good and made up some bullshit in the hopes that they could convince you or the insurance company to buy a new roof.

Nope, people are still dumb enough to buy the metal roofs with the full knowledge it will have to be replaced no matter condition in 15 years.

Its users link content created elsewhere, effectively siphoning value from  \nother sources via its users.\n2. Its users create new content specifically for it, thus profiting of off the  \nfree labour and content made by its users\n\nThis means that Reddit creates no value but exploits its users to generate the  \nvalue that uses to sell advertisements, charge its users for meaningless tokens,  \nsell NFTs, and seek private investment. Reddit relies on volunteer moderation by  \npeople who receive no benefit, not thanks, and definitely no pay. Reddit is  \nprofiting entirely off all of its users doing all of the work from gathering  \nlinks, to making comments, to moderating everything, all for free. Reddit is\nalso going to sell your information, you data, your content to third party AI\ncompanies so that they can train their models on your work, your life, your\ncontent and Reddit can make money from it, all while you see nothing in return.\n\n## Lack of respect for its third party developers\n\nI'm sure everyone at this point is familiar with the API changes putting many  \nthird party application developers out of business. Reddit saw how much money  \nentities like OpenAI and other data scraping firms are making and wants a slice  \nof that pie, and doesn't care who it tramples on in the process. Third party  \ndevelopers have created tools that make the use of Reddit far more appealing and  \nfeasible for so many people, again freely creating value for the company, and  \nit doesn't care that it's killing off these initiatives in order to take some of  \nthe profits it thinks it's entitled to.\n\n## Lack of respect for other cultures\n\nReddit spreads and enforces right wing, libertarian, US values, morals, and  \nethics, forcing other cultures to abandon their own values and adopt American  \nones if they wish to provide free labour and content to a for profit American  \ncorporation. American cultural hegemony is ever present and only made worse by  \ncompanies like Reddit actively forcing their values and social mores upon  \nforeign cultures without any sensitivity or care for local values and customs.  \nMeanwhile they allow reprehensible ideologies to spread through their network  \nunchecked because, while other nations might make such hate and bigotry illegal,  \nReddit holds \"Free Speech\" in the highest regard, but only so long as it doesn't  \noffend their own American sensibilities.\n\n## Lack for respect for the truth\n\nReddit has long been associated with disinformation, conspiracy theories,  \nastroturfing, and many such targeted attacks against the truth. Again protected  \nunder a veil of \"Free Speech\", these harmful lies spread far and wide using  \nReddit as a base. Reddit allows whole deranged communities and power-mad  \nmoderators to enforce their own twisted world-views, allowing them to silence  \ndissenting voices who oppose the radical, and often bigoted, vitriol spewed by  \nthose who fear leaving their own bubbles of conformity and isolation.\n\n## Lack of respect for common decency\n\nReddit is full of hate and bigotry. Many subreddits contain casual exclusion,  \ndiscrimination, insults, homophobia, transphobia, racism, anti-semitism,  \ncolonialism, imperialism, American exceptionalism, and just general edgy hatred.  \nReddit is toxic, it creates, incentivises, and profits off of \"engagement\" and  \n\"high arousal emotions\" which is a polite way of saying \"shouting matches\" and  \n\"fear and hatred\".\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf not for ideological reasons then at least leave Reddit for personal ones. Do  \nYou enjoy endlessly scrolling Reddit? Does constantly refreshing your feed bring  \nyou any joy or pleasure? Does getting into meaningless internet arguments with  \nstrangers on the internet improve your life? Quit Reddit, if only for a few  \nweeks, and see if it improves your life.\n\nI am leaving Reddit for good. I urge you to do so as well.\n\n### Comment ID e98lq6b with +16 score by [(coebruh, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e98lq6b/) (in reply to ID e98kx3o):\nOh, you know we do!\n\n## Comment ID e9816yd with +41 score by [(DeadKittyPool, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e9816yd/) (in reply to ID 9uulai):\nFrankly, I've never felt voting to be all that essential to the process.\n\n### Comment ID e983dk9 with +34 score by [(giaaeron, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e983dk9/) (in reply to ID e9816yd):\nNo kidding, Ford.\n\n#### Comment ID e98rftb with +5 score by [(sumppumpslump, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e98rftb/) (in reply to ID e983dk9):\nHi my name's Gerry and I like movies\n\n## Comment ID e98hwmc with +11 score by [(CannibalRed, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e98hwmc/) (in reply to ID 9uulai):\nIs everyone enjoying their FREE BEER!\n\n## Comment ID e98s9kl with +6 score by [(GolemThe3rd, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e98s9kl/) (in reply to ID 9uulai):\nAccourding to Moores law a computer in the year 3000 should be 2^684.66 times faster than one in 1973 (yes I know this is impossible, but its interesting)\n\n### Comment ID e98zr0z with +4 score by [(UnfetteredThoughts, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e98zr0z/) (in reply to ID e98s9kl):\nShame Moore's Law is breaking down already.\n\n## Comment ID e98tkan with +5 score by [(CheckersSpeech, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e98tkan/) (in reply to ID 9uulai):\nAt any rate, I *certainly* wouldn't harm the child.   \n\n*[Truthoscope goes nuts]*\n\n## Comment ID e98tmub with +5 score by [(CheckersSpeech, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e98tmub/) (in reply to ID 9uulai):\nPuny Human #1, Puny Human #2 ... and Morbo's good friend Richard Nixon!\n\n## Comment ID e98tek8 with +4 score by [(CheckersSpeech, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e98tek8/) (in reply to ID 9uulai):\nNixon's back!

You contact them and they assign a salesperson to coordinate what data you buy access to at what price. IIRC ours was in the range of $0.50 - $0.65 per API call. But that was at a volume of a couple million calls per year, with quarterly payments. So, very spendy. Which is a bad idea for Nearmap, since despite being the incumbent giant for so long, their marginal cost in providing the data is low enough they could choose to be quite affordable and expand their customer base, saving money by going self-service to make their product more approachable. Since so many other options exist they need to adapt or else suffer from pricing themselves out of the market.\n\n## Comment ID lo033es with +1 score by [(Training-Farm-5367, Reddit, 2024-09-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoofingSales/comments/16sqbiy/5_instant_roof_measurements/lo033es/) (in reply to ID 16sqbiy):\nHey there!

Believe it or not, you need to have a viable and believable plan to use 2-3M for someone to invest.\n\n“That seems counterintuitive! Why would someone want to give me MORE money?”\n\nHaving more cash on hand (in competent hands where there’s a plan to put that money to use) actually derisks the investment. 50k in a company means there’s zero margin for error. If you don’t deliver or make a mistake, that 50k is gone. With 2-3M, you have longer runway to deliver, make mistakes, etc. You also have a budget for marketing and acquiring users, hiring a team, etc, all of which is important. Without that, and only investing 50k, you might have a product but you have no path to finding anyone to use/buy your product, and someone has bet on just one persons ability for deliver it all.\n\n## Comment ID l6y7q7a with +43 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l6y7q7a/) (in reply to ID 1d7bqx2):\n[removed]\n\n### Comment ID l6z6dos with +6 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l6z6dos/) (in reply to ID l6y7q7a):\ni had angels offer 10-20 each. but only after many months of work\n\n#### Comment ID l6zqy8i with +7 score by [(TriggernometryPhD, Reddit, 2024-06-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l6zqy8i/) (in reply to ID l6z6dos):\nThe juice is not worth the squeeze.\n\n## Comment ID l6z04ml with +8 score by [(DancinWithWolves, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l6z04ml/) (in reply to ID 1d7bqx2):\nDepending on your area, you should be able to find a local network of angel investors.

Success of a VC fund is based on the \"power law\" where most companies in the portfolio will fail, but a couple will be a massive successes (e.g. the Facebooks) which will not only offset the other failed companies in the portfolio, but also return outsized gains for the investors of the fund (i.e. LPs). In other words, VCs need to make bets on companies where 1) the company has enough potential to be worth in the billions, and 2) the VC firm has enough invested where they won't be too diluted when (if) that exit event happens.\n\nFor perspective, the startup I joined as the first employee raised a $7M seed round. $50k checks would come from angel investors to fill out the round and bring on advisors.\n\nLike others said, potentially work with a bank or do a family and friends round.

Similar to a Viking in a sense, where he fights with reckless abandon, but he won’t roll over and die, he wants whoever kills him to EARN the kill. However the difference is that Io isn’t comforted by the fact that he’ll die gloriously or will go to Valhalla, he just wants to die so he can achieve piece from all the fighting. \n\nI think this is showcased well when he’s talking to all the kids in the first movie, basically calling them cannon-fodder so he can achieve his mission, without showing a shred of discomfort that he’s leading literally dozens of kids to death. You have to be so depressed or fucked in the head to do that. The only time I think he’s genuinely happy is when he’s playing the drums in the second movie. \n\n(To be fair, I haven’t read the manga, so he may be different in that)\n\n#### Comment ID jexgz81 with +100 score by [(Diazmet, Reddit, 2023-04-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/12bhi4s/a_lot_of_my_friends_think_that_io_fleming_is_a/jexgz81/) (in reply to ID jexf8pf):\nNah the manga spends even more time going into the feddies love of using child soldiers in shitty MS as cannon fodder… IO isn’t much older than them either… honestly one of the things I love about Thunderbolt is it really goes back to Gundams core message that both sides are terribly flawed and that out side powers like Luna are heavily profiting off the war\n\n#### Comment ID jezoozk with +9 score by [(yenmeng, Reddit, 2023-04-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/12bhi4s/a_lot_of_my_friends_think_that_io_fleming_is_a/jezoozk/) (in reply to ID jexf8pf):\nThe part where he sees the kids worship the Gundam was so good\n\n### Comment ID jey0meq with +36 score by [(KLReviews, Reddit, 2023-04-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/12bhi4s/a_lot_of_my_friends_think_that_io_fleming_is_a/jey0meq/) (in reply to ID jewuw51):\nYeah the only reason Io 'loses' in the battle is because he personally sees it as a defeat.

Can it handle it? Maybe. Is it a miracle he didn't kill himself and explode? No, because he's actually that good of a pilot. Lo was blessed with luck but also had an incredible skill set as a pilot. The FA-78 isn't the f91 or unicorn, there's no psycho frame, no bio sensor, it's just the learning computer (which considering how short it lived probably didn't learn much) like on the regular rx-78 and the pilot interface. The fact that lo was able to pilot it to great success and also hit what he was aiming at is a testament to him being a fantastic pilot. The fact that zeons living dead division had to not only dismember one of their own pilots but create a nerve based interface on a mobile suit just to keep from being exterminated is a testament to lo. He's not just a good pilot, he's a great pilot. His performance in the atlas is more an example of someone not being prepared for an adverse battlefield, which is more of an issue with his command than him.\n\n### Comment ID jezrihk with +1 score by [(Russet_Wolf_13, Reddit, 2023-04-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/12bhi4s/a_lot_of_my_friends_think_that_io_fleming_is_a/jezrihk/) (in reply to ID jexcftb):\nYour jet engine analogy is funny given [they actually did that in the 70s.](https://www.carthrottle.com/post/wmp9pqy/)\n\n#### Comment ID jf09hdq with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-04-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/12bhi4s/a_lot_of_my_friends_think_that_io_fleming_is_a/jf09hdq/) (in reply to ID jezrihk):\nI'm not surprised.

Kind of cryptic as Tomino explanations always go, but I think what it means is that Amuro is never going to escape the old mindset of the \"person\" being contained within an individual - whereas Kamille's mind and identity basically expanded to the whole of space.

Suletta probably ranks fairly high.\n\nWhy? Before the series starts she's been piloting Aerial for at least 6yrs (Cradel Planet has her doing a colony rescue at around age 11), and has been brought up learning how to pilot/playing in the cockpit since a young age. Granted she may not have wartime experience but near a decade of piloting experience. Can quickly calculate travel time in her head, used a beam saber at a low powered mode like a scalpel and that's all before she got to the school.\n\nDuring her time at the school she expands on these skills, beating the top ranked 'fighter' at the school as well as many, many others. She ends up with the Holder title and only loses it because of outside interference, even after taking on multiple consecutive/endurance fights. \n\nThen you have her in the Caliburn, under significant physical distress, actively dodging probably the most OP suit in Witch while also fighting against a small army (granted we don't see full numbers of this) of drones and only taking a few kicks\\*.   \n\n\nFrom a skill level she's up there, even if she doesn't have a high kill-count. That decade of experience prior to the series start is more than most pilots from other AU's have in total.\n\n  \n\\*yes an argument can be made that neither of the combatants are actually trying to hurt each other.\n\n### Comment ID jsr49zz with +26 score by [(JumpingVillage3, Reddit, 2023-07-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/154ufpz/who_do_you_consider_the_most_technically_skilled/jsr49zz/) (in reply to ID jsqsdp9):\nWfM has a lot of talented pilots. El5n kept up with gundvolvas and a GUND-formatted Norea (who later fights toe to toe with Kenanji) without activating the Pharact's greatest weapons, mobility features and being under gravity which it wasn't necessarily designed for. Guel constantly fought Gundams in way worse mobile suits and had some level of advantage, even pushing Lauda to use the GUND-Arm system on the Schwarzette to beat Guel who wasn't trying to kill him in a melee oriented Dilanza of all things. Prospera has also been stated to be a better pilot than Suletta in Cradle Planet, meaning that whatever Suletta did at the end of the series, her mom can likely do better. It's just that WFM suits technology wise are only above average within the gundam multiverse, otherwise we'd have an argument for one of the most talented/powerful main casts in Gundam.\n\n#### Comment ID jssh33o with +3 score by [(KABOOMBYTCH, Reddit, 2023-07-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/154ufpz/who_do_you_consider_the_most_technically_skilled/jssh33o/) (in reply to ID jsr49zz):\nI’m sad we never see boss girl prospera dishes it out in a mobile suit :/\n\n## Comment ID jsr855e with +6 score by [(PK-Starstorm1995, Reddit, 2023-07-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/154ufpz/who_do_you_consider_the_most_technically_skilled/jsr855e/) (in reply to ID 154ufpz):\nGorrad Ran or Domon\n\nGorrad is good enough to take on newtypes despite being a normal dude.\n\nAnd given his unique gundam controls in comparison to the rest of the series, domon is easily the most skilled fighter.\n\n### Comment ID jsrhgse with +9 score by [(Time-Touch-6433, Reddit, 2023-07-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/154ufpz/who_do_you_consider_the_most_technically_skilled/jsrhgse/) (in reply to ID jsr855e):\nDomon is blatantly superhuman tho\n\n#### Comment ID jsumx6r with +1 score by [(Rendum_, Reddit, 2023-07-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/154ufpz/who_do_you_consider_the_most_technically_skilled/jsumx6r/) (in reply to ID jsrhgse):\nMan litrrally kicks a bullet in the first episode\n\n### Comment ID jsrrelr with +5 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-07-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/154ufpz/who_do_you_consider_the_most_technically_skilled/jsrrelr/) (in reply to ID jsr855e):\nCompare Domon or Master Asia to any other pilot in G using the same piloting system and it’s obvious how abnormally and insanely skilled the two are\n\n#### Comment ID jsrxtg7 with +6 score by [(Luster-Purge, Reddit, 2023-07-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/154ufpz/who_do_you_consider_the_most_technically_skilled/jsrxtg7/) (in reply to ID jsrrelr):\nOne of the best things in Build Fighters Try is they unapologetically acknowledge how utterly OP the Jigen Haoh school of Martial Arts is, because they reveal Sekai's master?\n\nIt's Domon.

If he’s a newtype, he isn’t depicted as being that strong of one and he’s among the youngest pilots we’ve seen, but he’a dangerously effective in the Victory and V2.

If you banned coordinators you’d have to ban anyone who just so happened to have good genes for being a pilot as well. Coordinators are just people who have essentially had their genetic code modified to have specific genes in them. So on average a coordinator is stronger, smarter, faster, than a natural, but you will still have naturals every now and then that are a match for coordinators.\n\nMy vote is for either Rau la Creuset, Ali Al-Saachez, or Graham Acker.\n\n## Comment ID jsrkm1p with +2 score by [(alkonium, Reddit, 2023-07-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/154ufpz/who_do_you_consider_the_most_technically_skilled/jsrkm1p/) (in reply to ID 154ufpz):\nWhat I tend to look at is ordinary humans who are able to hold their own against Newtypes or their equivalents.

Suits and ships. Those guys are the GOATs. Char isn't even top 10 for Zeon if I recall. If he was he was only 7th or something like that. The highest kill counts for both sides were Oldtypes.\n\nAlso, in the AU series, I have to go with Master Asia in G Gundam. It is superhuman BS, but no psychic powers or suit specs, that man could literally beat up an MS or MF with his bare hands.\n\nIn AC, it has to be Zechs, because he mastered the Tallgeese without any of the pilot safety advantages the Gundam's had. If not Miliardo, I would say it was Trowa. That kid is a monster, and he fought at most times in an MS that was meant for almost purely ranged combat, but still kicked ass at close range.\n\nIn AW, Jamil Neate. After losing his Newtype abilities that man was still one helluva pilot, and officer.\n\n\nIn Turn A, I go Loran. Again, this kid has no Newtype magic or mumbo jumbo, and he repeatedly beats more experienced enemy aces, even though he doesn't want to fight.\n\nCE, it's hands down Lowe Gear/Guel. The man may have been using his computer AI buddy for assistance, but he went toe to toe with some of that world's strongest Coordinators, including a few that had the spatial awareness to use Dragoons and Gunbarrels, he is a champ.\n\nNext up, is AD, and I go Graham Aker all day. Unless we include Manga, and he and Fon Spaak tie. They are both beasts in combat.\n\nThen it's Age, and it's Asemu Asuno all day. The man earned the name Super Pilot.\n\nNext up, another future of the UC, with G Reco. I would go with Belri. The kid might not have always been the best, but he continually improved as the series went on. I still wish it would have been better received so we would have got the whole series. Maybe if they did a rehash of the series with a different character designer people wouldn't dump on it so bad.\n\nThen it's the Build series, and if all of them, I say either Reiji from Fighters or Hiroto, from Divers Re:RISE.\n\nI would add the Real Build series, but for now, I am sticking to the Anime and Manga.\n\nPD, I go with Mcillis, because that dude beat AV using Gundam MS in a less powerful suit.\n\nFinally, Ad Stella, I gotta go with my dude Bob. Might not have ever used a Gundam, but he could've beaten his brother's if he hadn't been pulling his punches. He had great character growth.\n\n## Comment ID jsqppcy with +1 score by [(AutoModerator, Reddit, 2023-07-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/154ufpz/who_do_you_consider_the_most_technically_skilled/jsqppcy/) (in reply to ID 154ufpz):\nDaily reminder that the Reddit admins are like the EFSF.

I mean so was Heeeo but that boy got a death wish. Considering how limited their Gundam were (specifically Duo and Trowa) they still managed to fight other Gundams to a draw. Treiza wasn't bad either.\n\nI would say Char, Amuro, Camille,  Judau weren't bad either as pilots. People forget they became newtypes they weren't born newtypes. So alot of their abilities displayed were actual piloting skills not just new type power. Judau gets vastly underestimated as people forget he used to rob ms ala Garrod Ran. Old man Judau was so skillful he was fighting Crossbone people with a broken ass double Zeta.\n\nHe'll I would even put Banagheir up there. I mean yes Unicorn in destroy mode is quite OP. But he did fight the second coming of Char in its normal form and managed to hit him. Not to mention in Narrative he managed to do things even though his Gundam wasn't another unicorn.\n\n## Comment ID jsvwh5k with +1 score by [(zuurr, Reddit, 2023-07-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/154ufpz/who_do_you_consider_the_most_technically_skilled/jsvwh5k/) (in reply to ID 154ufpz):\nHarry Ord towards the end of Turn A Gundam is just unbeatable.

      "# [Top 5 Data Lineage Tools (+ How to Choose)](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-lineage-tools)\nThe good news is that business leaders and stakeholders are increasingly seeing the value of data lineage in their organizations. The even better news is that the data lineage tool market offers more options for data teams every year.\n\nAs a whole, the global data catalog market is projected to grow from $878.8 million in 2023 to $4,680.9 million by 2032, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.7% during this period. That’s respectable.\n\nSo, as more data teams enter the market for lineage tools, it’s important to distinguish the apples from the oranges. Much like data lineage itself, knowledge is power when it comes to vetting potential lineage tools.\n\nThat's why we’re showcasing five potentially potent tools for data lineage here, noting the pros, cons, and pricing for each.\n\nData lineage tools: 5 worth considering\n\nGable.ai\n\nGable is a pioneering data contracts platform that's proactively bridging the gap between data producers and consumers. It focuses on proactive data quality management (i.e., shifting data quality left) by implementing data contracts early in the data lifecycle. In doing so, Gable allows teams to draft, define, and enforce data contracts, providing a collaborative environment for software developers, data engineers, and data scientists.\n\nWhile not a traditional data lineage tool, Gable's approach to data contracts offers a unique perspective on lineage. By defining and versioning data contracts, it provides visibility into data origins, transformations, and dependencies, effectively creating a proactive form of lineage tracking that starts at the source of data creation.\n\nPros:\n\nOffers a highly proactive approach to data quality\n\nUniquely able to integrate directly into development workflows\n\nCan also reduce costs and wasted effort by maintaining data integrity early in the process\n\nCons:\n\nAs a relative newcomer, Gable.ai may present a bit of a learning curve compared to other tools listed\n\nPricing: Interested parties should sign up to Gable’s product waitlist to learn more as details become available.\n\nAlation\n\nAlation is a comprehensive data intelligence platform that offers robust data lineage capabilities. It provides automatic table and column-level lineage, along with business lineage featuring metadata overlays. Alation's strength as a lineage tool lies in its advanced visualization capabilities—including end-to-end mini-map previews and data flow filtering.\n\nTogether, these features allow users to trace data from its origin through various transformations to its final use, providing crucial insights for data governance, impact analysis, and regulatory compliance. Alation's lineage capabilities are especially valuable for organizations dealing with complex data ecosystems, as they offer a clear, visual representation of data flows across multiple systems and processes.\n\nPros:\n\nA comprehensive data intelligence solution\n\nOffers advanced visualization capabilities\n\nIntegrates with many data sources\n\nCons:\n\nCan be complex to implement and use\n\nMay also be overkill for organizations with simpler needs\n\n‍\n\nPricing: Alation doesn't publicly disclose pricing. Those interested need to contact sales for a custom quote.\n\nSecoda\n\nSecoda bills itself as a data discovery and documentation platform that emphasizes user-friendliness and automation in its data lineage features. It offers automated data lineage capture and visualization, integrating with a variety of data sources and tools to provide a comprehensive view of data flows.\n\nAs a lineage tool, Secoda stands out for its ability to automatically generate and maintain up-to-date lineage information with a minimal amount of manual input. Its column-level lineage capabilities allow for granular tracking of data transformations, making it easier for organizations to understand data dependencies, troubleshoot issues, and assess the impact of changes across their data ecosystem.\n\nPros:\n\nProvides a user-friendly interface\n\nOffers strong integration capabilities\n\nLineage capture can be automated\n\nCons:\n\nAdvanced features may necessitate a learning curve for some\n\nLike Gable.ai, Scoda is a relatively new player in the market\n\nPricing: At this time Secoda doesn't publicly share pricing information. Curious parties will need to contact sales for a quote.\n\nCollibra\n\nCollibra is a solid data intelligence platform offering a suite of tools for data governance, cataloging, and lineage. Its data lineage capabilities, specifically, provide end-to-end lineage mapping with technical lineage at table, column, and transformation levels.\n\nViewed solely as a lineage tool, Collibra provides data teams with a comprehensive view of data flows across an organization. Its interactive lineage diagrams offer intuitive visual representations of complex data relationships, enabling users to easily trace data origins, understand transformations, and assess the impact of changes.\n\nThis makes Collibra particularly valuable for organizations that need to prioritize data governance, regulatory compliance, and maintain an in-depth understanding of their data landscape.\n\nPros:\n\nViewed as a comprehensive data governance solution\n\nOffers strong data lineage visualization capabilities\n\nVery robust metadata management\n\nCons:\n\nCan be expensive for smaller organizations\n\nComes with a comparatively complex implementation process\n\nPricing: Collibra offers yearly licensing subscriptions:\n\n12-month plan: $170,000\n\n24-month plan: $340,000\n\n36-month plan: $510,000\n\nDbt (data build tool)\n\nKnown primarily as a data transformation tool, dbt does data lineage capabilities. However, said capabilities are more limited compared to other tools featured above. It provides table-level lineage within dbt projects, with column-level lineage available in the dbt Cloud Enterprise tier.\n\nTherefore, when viewed as a potential lineage tool, dbt's strength lies in its native integration with data transformation processes.\n\nDbt does visualize dependencies between models, which helps data teams understand how changes in one part of a data pipeline might affect others.\n\nIts lineage features are more focused on assets managed within dbt projects—making this integration of particular value for organizations already using dbt, as it provides immediate insights into the lineage of transformed data without the need for additional tools.\n\nPros:\n\nNative integration with data transformation processes\n\nOpen-source core with active community\n\nVisualizes dependencies between models\n\nCons:\n\nLimited to dbt-managed assets\n\nFull column-level lineage only available in its Enterprise tier\n\nPricing: dbt offers three subscription tiers:\n\nCore: Free and open-source\n\nCloud Team: Starts at $50 per user per month\n\nCloud Enterprise: Custom pricing, make inquiries to dbt’s sales team\n\nWhy are data lineage tools important?\n\nAs a refresher, know that data lineage tools should increasingly be seen as table-stakes for modern organizations to establish (and reap the multitude of rewards from) robust data governance and management practices.\n\nIt’s these tools that provide the features and functionality that make fostering and maintaining pristine data quality possible.\n\nEnhanced data transparency and visibility\n\nData lineage tools provide a clear and real-time view of how data flows across an organization, enabling stakeholders to gain deeper insights into data usage, dependencies, and transformations.\n\nOft-overlooked, this transparency also contributes to a culture of impactful data-driven decision-making.\n\nImproved data quality and accuracy\n\nAutomated data lineage tools help identify data quality issues by highlighting anomalies, transformations, and potential errors in the lineage. This early detection allows data teams, stewards, and scientists to address issues promptly, ensuring data remains accurate and reliable.\n\nEfficient compliance and auditing\n\nData lineage is essential for regulatory compliance, especially in industries with strict and/or complex data regulations. These tools provide an audit trail demonstrating how data is used and processed, facilitating compliance reporting and audits.\n\nStreamlined data governance\n\nData lineage simplifies data governance by providing a clear understanding of data assets, their ownership, and the impact of made changes. As a result, lineage tools make it easier to enforce data policies and maintain optimal data quality.\n\nFaster troubleshooting and issue resolution\n\nWhen data issues arise, lineage tools enable faster troubleshooting by allowing data professionals to trace problems back to their source, identify root causes, and implement solutions as quickly as possible.\n\nEnhanced data security\n\nData lineage helps organizations identify vulnerabilities in their data pipelines and access controls, allowing for the implementation of robust security measures to safeguard sensitive information.\n\nEffective change management\n\nBy visualizing how data flows are impacted by changes, teams can assess potential risks and make informed decisions during system upgrades or process modifications.\n\nSupport for data-driven decision making\n\nData lineage empowers more people (both data professionals and their data-adjacent peers) to understand and leverage data assets, supporting true data democratization and enabling more informed decision-making throughout the organization.\n\nOperational efficiency\n\nBy automating data mapping and reducing the need for manual impact analysis, data lineage tools can save significant time and resources, enhancing overall operational efficiency.\n\nRisk management\n\nData lineage manages risks associated with data usage, transformations, and access by providing a comprehensive view of data flow and dependencies.\n\nHow to choose the right data lineage tool\n\nSituations, organizational needs, technical capabilities, and lineage tools themselves are all always in flux—so there will never be a one “best” way to go about choosing the right data lineage tool.\n\nThat said, by carefully considering the following factors and aligning them with your organization's specific requirements, you can streamline to process of learning about and comparing tools, ensuring the chosen tool provides the most value and the best fit possible:\n\nDetermine scope and depth of lineage tracking: Look for tools that provide comprehensive lineage at multiple levels—table, column, and row-level lineage. Ensure the tool captures lineage across your entire data ecosystem, not just from limited sources like BI tools.\n\nReview integration capabilities: The tool should integrate well with your existing data stack, including data warehouses, ETL/ELT tools, BI platforms, etc. Check the depth of integrations—some tools may claim to integrate with a platform but only offer surface-level connectivity.\n\nCompare visualization and analysis features: Clear, intuitive visualizations of data lineage are crucial for understanding complex data flows. Look for capabilities like impact analysis, data flow mapping, and the ability to trace data upstream and downstream.\n\nDetermine if automation and metadata collection is necessary: Automated lineage capture reduces manual effort and improves accuracy. The tool should be able to automatically collect and update metadata as your data environment changes.\n\nVet each tool’s ability to scale: Ensure the tool can handle your current data volume and complexity, as well as scale as your data ecosystem grows.\n\nConsider usability and accessibility: The tool should be user-friendly for both technical and non-technical team members. Features like search functionality and collaborative capabilities are valuable.\n\nInquire about compliance and governance support: If regulatory compliance is a concern, look for tools that offer features to support data governance and compliance efforts.\n\nAsses potential performance impact: Consider how the lineage tool might affect the performance of your data systems, especially for large-scale implementations.\n\nWeigh cost against potential ROI: Evaluate the pricing model and ensure it aligns with your budget and expected value from implementing data lineage.\n\nPrioritize future-proofing: Choose a tool that can adapt to evolving data architectures and technologies.\n\nGet a sense of each tool’s support and community: Consider the level of support provided by the vendor and the existence of an active user community for knowledge sharing.\n\nDetermine if complementary features are available: Some tools offer additional features like data quality monitoring or data cataloging that may provide added value.\n\nLooking to shift your lineage left?\n\nAgain, the right data lineage tools can dramatically enhance data governance, transparency, and quality within your organization. But it should now be crystal clear that choosing the right solution is crucial. Whether you're looking to streamline compliance, ensure data accuracy, or improve decision-making, having the right tool in your data stack is non-negotiable.\n\nGable.ai goes beyond traditional lineage solutions by introducing proactive data contracts, which tackle data quality at the source. By implementing Gable.ai's innovative approach, you’ll be setting your team up for long-term success, maintaining data integrity, and reducing costly errors early in the process.\n\nTo learn more about how Gable.ai can empower your organization with next-level data contracts and improve your overall data management strategy, sign up for our product waitlist today.\n\n‍",

      "# [College student Wyatt Gable defeats 10-term state Rep. George Cleveland in North Carolina primary by GARY D. ROBERTSON on 2024-03-07](https://apnews.com/article/north-carolina-legislative-primaries-recount-c2e31c304ab9d0ba7f3ecde96538844e)\nRALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — College student Wyatt Gable defeated a 10-term North Carolina state House member in a primary election this week, while another incumbent currently trails in a very close race with his intraparty opponent.\n\nThe 21-year-old Gable, a student at East Carolina University, defeated Rep. George Cleveland of Onslow County.\n\nMeanwhile, five-term Rep. Cecil Brockman of Guilford County, a Democrat targeted by some activists in his party for his willingness to vote with Republicans on some key bills, survived a primary challenge from James Adams.\n\nThe Associated Press called victories for Brockman and Gable on Thursday after concluding there weren’t enough outstanding votes for their trailing opponents to catch up.\n\nThe margins between primary candidates for two other House seats are narrow enough for a trailing candidate to seek a recount. As a result, the AP has not called a primary race involving 10-term Democratic Rep. Michael Wray of Northampton County. Unofficial primary results show Wray trailing rival Rodney Pierce of Halifax County.\n\nWhile the differential in unofficial results between GOP Rep. Sam Watford of Davidson County and Eddie Gallimore also is within the margin to seek a recount, the AP declared Watford the winner later Thursday after the trailing Gallimore said in an interview that he would not ask for one. Watford is in his fourth House term, while Gallimore is a former senator.\n\nState law says trailing candidates in legislative contests can seek a recount if their vote totals are no more than 1 percentage point behind the leading candidate. Provisional ballots will be reviewed by county elections boards and added to vote totals. The boards meet late next week to finalize tabulations.\n\nCleveland, an 84-year-old former Marine Corps drill instructor, lost narrowly to Gable, who leads the ECU chapter of Turning Point USA, an activist group for young conservatives. Gable’s campaign website says he would work to lower taxes, renew home economics classes in public schools and improve health care fveterans.\n\nGable told The Daily News of Jacksonville that his success in the race “came down to people wanting a fresh set of ideas.”\n\n“It took a lot of hard work by me and my team,” he said. “A lot of doors were knocked, and phone calls were made.”\n\nCleveland, a budget subcommittee chairman for dozens of state agencies, has advanced bills supporting the military and discouraging illegal immigration. The Associated Press left him a phone message seeking comment Thursday.\n\nLike Brockman, Wray has been criticized by outside groups and other Democrats for aligning himself at times with leaders in the Republican-controlled House, who made him one of the senior chairmen on the powerful House Finance Committee.\n\nTwo other General Assembly incumbents lost their primary elections on Tuesday: Democratic Sen. Mike Woodard of Durham County and Republican Rep. Kevin Crutchfield of Cabarrus County.\n\nWinners in these legislative primaries will all face November general election opposition, except for Wray or Pierce, who would have no Republican opposition.\n\n___\n\nA previous version of this story incorrectly stated Rep. Cecil Brockman would not face a Republican opponent in November.",

      "# [This 21-year-old Republican beat a 10-term incumbent. What’s next for Wyatt Gable? by JAMES POLLARD, apnews.com, james-pollard on 2024-03-08](https://apnews.com/article/north-carolina-college-republican-primary-64f6da7d7e55578245f291918014b940)\nWhile his college friends celebrated the end of midterm exams with a spring break trip to Florida, 21-year-old Wyatt Gable entered the home stretch of his bid to oust a 10-term Republican from the North Carolina House.\n\nWeeks spent phone banking after class and driving about an hour home on the weekends to knock on doors paid off. The East Carolina University junior narrowly beat state Rep. George Cleveland, 84, this week in a primary election in which he cast himself as “the future of the Republican Party.”\n\nGable’s victory comes as voters nationwide express misgivings about the older ages of the frontrunners in the 2024 presidential race. Gable, who described himself as a “big Trump supporter,” said he hopes that his candidacy injects youthful energy into a Republican Party that is often dominated by “older people” at county meetings.\n\nWhile some voters told him he was too young to hold office, Gable said, others considered his opponent too old.\n\n“A lot of people were just ready for a fresh face,” Gable said in an interview.\n\nGable is the president of East Carolina’s chapter of Turning Point USA, a conservative youth group founded by right-wing provocateur Charlie Kirk. In addition to his political advocacy against causes like gender-expansive restroom access, the business management major said he runs club track and plays intramural sports.\n\nThe education system’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic compelled Gable to pursue elected office. As an unvaccinated freshman in college, Gable said, he was required to test every week for the disease. Failure to do so risked the deactivation of his student identification card, which meant no access to dining halls. He perceived the policy, which sought to limit the spread of the disease, as “total control.”\n\nWhile sitting in a microeconomics class one day, Gable said, he sent an email about the issue to Cleveland, the lawmaker he defeated this week. Gable said he never got a response.\n\n“I felt like no one really cared or didn’t want to do anything,” he said. “So, I’m going to be the one that does something.”\n\nGable hopes one day those ambitions could propel him to the governor’s mansion.\n\nCleveland, a former Marine Corps drill instructor who leads a budget subcommittee for dozens of state agencies, did not return a message seeking comment.\n\nCleveland represented his constituents well, Onslow County GOP chair Christine Card said. But she thinks the national conversation around politicians’ ages left voters wanting someone new.\n\n“I don’t think it’s a vote against Rep. Cleveland,” she said. “It’s a vote for change and a vote for youth.”\n\nCard commended Gable for taking the race seriously, noting that he even enlisted his buddies to help contact voters. Gable estimates that he alone knocked on 1,000 doors and made 400 phone calls. Supporters handed out campaign materials at almost every voting precinct on election day, Gable added.\n\nHe will face Democrat Carmen Spicer in November. He is expected to win the general election in rural Onslow County, home to Camp Lejeune and 120 miles southeast of Raleigh, the capital. Donald Trump won three out of every five votes cast in the district for the 2020 presidential election.\n\nIn the North Carolina General Assembly, Gable plans to tackle education. He said high school students should take more home economics, shop and carpentry classes so they’re “prepared for the real world.” He also wants to put more emphasis on physical activity.\n\n“I’m still in college, so who better to work on the education system than someone that’s a part of it?” Gable said.\n\nAny first-year representative will face a “learning curve,” Card said. But Gable’s determination to challenge a longtime incumbent “shows something about what he’s made of,” she said, and his inexperience won’t be a problem.\n\nGable stressed that he would represent constituents of all ages, but that it’s important to include younger voices in public service. He wants to use his platform to improve turnout among people ages 18-29 and encourage that demographic to vote Republican.\n\nHe acknowledged that the last goal needs a lot of work. The GOP has performed poorly in every election cycle since 2016, he said, and voters don’t always believe the party offers many solutions.\n\n“Rebranding as a party and not electing the same cookie-cutter candidates,” he said, “is going to be a big part of it.”\n\n___",
      "# [GABLE delivers all-time high income, ready to propel businesses towards the AI FIRST era with the strategy of “Sustain = Smart + Secure.”](https://www.g-able.com/insights/g-able-enable-the-future)\nG-Able Public Company Limited, a leading \"Tech Enabler\" that helps businesses embrace every aspect of the digital era, has revealed its 2024 business strategy, focusing on developing digital solutions and capabilities while enhancing businesses' readiness to address various challenges on the path to becoming AI-ready organizations. GABLE plans to expand its Business Application segment through global HCM partnerships, offering full-suite digital solutions across five portfolios to meet business needs. This expansion aligns with the core strategy of \"Sustain = Smart + Secure,\" enabling clients’ businesses to navigate the AI-First era towards sustainable success.\n\nDr. Chaiyuth Chunnahacha, CEO of G-Able Public Company Limited, stated, “As a SET-listed digital tech giant equipped with technologies and capital, our main aim is to tap into our modern and smart technologies and digital solutions to serve future business needs, secure organizational data, increase profitability, and ensure sustainable growth of our clients in the AI-First era, in alignment with the strategy of 'Sustain = Smart + Secure.'”\n\nIn 2023, GABLE achieved huge success in its initial public offering and SET-listing as G-Able Public Company Limited. This has enhanced its readiness in terms of its capital for investment in its capacity and capabilities in line with its plan to drive strong and sustainable growth. GABLE’s own software platform has served as a key growth engine propelling the Group’s solid business expansion across many segments. The five affiliated companies have been key in generating the Group’s income, using its Value-Added Distribution to further its growth. The Group’s recurring income exceeded one half of the total income, and its backlog portion climbed up to an unprecedented level of over Baht 4.5 billion.\n\nWith its extensive experience of over 35 years in helping businesses gain a competitive edge through technologies, GABLE has seen opportunities to steer its growth by capitalizing on the AI trend that plays an increasingly important role in organizations. All businesses need to develop their systems to become AI-ready organizations. In doing so, Cloud-based IT infrastructures, data analytics systems through big data platforms, and 24-hour cybersecurity systems should be established to ensure that front-office and back-office systems are ready to work synchronously with AI in the future.\n\nApart from the AI trend that is bringing more growth opportunities for GABLE, building ‘Smart Organizations’ through business applications such as human capital management software is another key growth driver because one crucial asset of an organization is “human.” According to Gartner, the HCM market is expected to see an average growth rate over the next three years at 18%. As organizations need to improve their competitiveness through building up a pool of talents, software platforms can help them do so through the use of big data and AI in talent analytics, skill management, and productivity and efficiency enhancement of employees across sections.\n\nGABLE’s 2024 strategy is originated from the adoption of the concept of “Smart + Secure” to ensure clients’ business sustainability. This consists of the following 3 main guidelines: To integrate GABLE’s Enterprise Solutions and Services core business comprising 5 portfolios, namely Data Analytics, Cloud, Cybersecurity, Application Development, and Managed Tech Services, with its IP platforms to support the preparation of AI-ready data and AI-ready security, as higher demands\n\nfor AI and cybersecurity will boost GABLE’s growth.\n\nTo expand the Group’s capabilities through potential business applications in HCM and ERP through partnering with global entities with expertise across various fields and selecting other interesting smart business applications to provide continued support for its clients. To focus on investment in businesses that are aligned with GABLE’s business concept to secure\n\nmore opportunities and satisfying rates of return; and to gain competitive edge by using its funds from its IPO worth around Baht 600 million to propel business growth under the investment framework covering three main areas: Right Product, Right Technology; Win-Win business Synergy; and Right Price, Right Value.\n\nMs. Raveeratana Satchavarodom, Chief Finance & Strategy Officer of G-Able Public Company Limited stated that in 2023, GABLE’s operating income reached Baht 5,338 million, 13% up from 2022. Despite external factors and fluctuations at macro and industrial levels leading to stronger competition, GABLE was able to navigate these challenges, achieving steadfast expansion and double-digit growth rates in income across all segments, including Enterprise Solution, Valued Added Distribution, and Software Platform, from its clients.\n\nMoreover, after its IPO, GABLE was able to generate a gross profit of Baht 1,099 million in 2023, growing 10% year-on-year, or a gross profit margin of 21%, about the same level as last year. GABLE’s net profit for 2023 stayed at Baht 253 million, and the backlog portion reached an all-time high at Baht 4,544 million, up 16% from Q3 of 2023, ready to support future income recognition. The backlog level is set to support future income generation in 2024 of over Baht 2,753 million, accounting for nearly one-half of the target income in 2024. Furthermore, the Company’s opportunities to further grow its business come from\n\nthe accelerated demand for the creation of AI-ready organizations, the need to set up data analytics and cybersecurity, its partnerships in developing business applications, and inorganic investment through M&As.\n\nBy adopting the strategy of “Sustain = Smart + Secure,” in 2024 GABLE will continue to operate its business based on the 3 guidelines, namely Smart Finance, Secure Finance, and Sustain Finance. Smart Finance is to create more financial returns from organic investment and inorganic investment. Secure Finance is to maintain financial discipline through secure operations and secure investment, focusing on sustainable investment within the so-called Investment Framework to ensure secure and sustainable business growth in the long term. And Sustain Finance is to establish sustainable financial growth, including mitigating risks to be within acceptable levels.\n\nThe above strategy will lead to GABLE’s growing backlog and its move towards reaching another all-time high this year at around Baht 4.5-5.5 billion. GABLE will expectedly continue to maintain its gross profit margin at 20-22% with its recurring income of more than 50% of the total income, to support risk management for investors. With its sound financial discipline and available capital of more than Baht 600 million from the IPO along with its capacity and capabilities, GABLE is ready to grow further in line with the upcoming trend in 2024.",
      "# [Gable Steveson makes switch from wrestling to football by signing with the Buffalo Bills by John Wawrow, Associated Press on 2024-05-31](https://www.ksat.com/sports/2024/05/31/gable-steveson-makes-switch-from-wrestling-to-football-by-signing-with-the-buffalo-bills/)\nORCHARD PARK, N.Y. – Olympic gold medal wrestler Gable Steveson is seeking to trade the mat for the gridiron by signing a standard undrafted rookie free agent contract with the Buffalo Bills on Friday.\n\nThe Bills list the 24-year-old Steveson as a defensive lineman in hopes his leverage techniques and agility can translate to football.\n\nListed at 5-foot-11 and 266 pounds, Steveson, at 21, became the youngest freestyle wrestler to win gold as a super heavyweight at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. He then went on to win two college national titles at Minnesota in 2021 and '22, and twice was named the Dan Hodge Trophy winner as the nation’s best college wrestler.\n\nAfter his second college championship, Steveson left his shoes in the center of the mat, symbolizing his retirement from amateur wrestling.\n\nIn Buffalo, Steveson joins a team with a head coach in Sean McDermott who was a two-time high school national wrestling champion growing up in Pennsylvania. And while McDermott went on to pursue football after high school, he credits wrestling for helping shape his life.\n\n“I have been fortunate to compete at the highest level of competition in my sport but am looking forward to the challenge of seeing how my wrestling skills may translate to football,” Steveson said, in a statement released by his agent, Carter Chow. “I am grateful to Coach McDermott, (GM) Brandon Beane and the Buffalo Bills organization for giving me this opportunity.\n\nAlthough Steveson's contract with Buffalo spans three years, it is not guaranteed unless he makes the team.\n\nThe Bills opened a spot to add Steveson by releasing Matt Haack, one of three punters on the roster. Buffalo re-signed Haack this offseason after adding him to their practice squad in the playoffs as insurance when Sam Martin was bothered by a hamstring injury.\n\nSteveson becomes the second player without past football experience Buffalo has added to its roster this offseason. Last month, the Bills used their final pick to select former English rugby player Travis Clayton in the seventh round of the draft. The 23-year-old Clayton, listed at 6-foot-7 and 303 pounds, is projected to play offensive line after spending this past winter learning about American football in the NFL's International Pathway Program.\n\nSteveson won gold at the Tokyo Games by scoring a dramatic last-second win against Geno Petriashvili. He had numerous options after the victory, and chose to return to college for a year and cash in on the new name, image and likeness rules that allowed college athletes to make money.\n\nHe signed an NIL deal with World Wrestling Entertainment before his final college season and later joined the company.\n\nAfter joining WWE, Steveson briefly returned to amateur wrestling last year. He competed at the U.S. Open and Final X and won both in dominant fashion. That qualified him for the world championships, but he chose not to compete.\n\nSteveson initially joined the WWE with much fanfare. He was mostly part of its developmental brand, NXT, before being released in May.\n\nSteveson is from Minnesota, and his mother named him Gable in honor of wrestler Don Gable, who won gold at the 1972 Munich Olympics.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Cliff Brunt in Oklahoma City contributed to this report.\n\n___",
      "# [AI Pack: Roof Characteristics by Vidya_5002 on 2022-08-02](https://help.nearmap.com/kb/articles/789-ai-pack-roof-characteristics)\nDescription\n\nThis AI Pack can be purchased as an add-on to the Residential Building Footprints pack. It adds AI Layers and AI Parcel outputs related to:\n\nThe dominant material of the roof (shingle, tile, metal or other)\n\nThe presence of various structural shapes on the roof (hip, gable, flat and turret presence)\n\nTrees overhanging the building.\n\nPack layers\n\nRoof\n\nTile\n\nShingle\n\nMetal\n\nHip\n\nGable\n\nDutch Gable\n\nFlat\n\nTurret\n\nTree Overhang\n\nLeaf-off Tree Overhang\n\nDormer Window\n\nAvailability\n\nIf you subscribe to Roof Characteristics or Building Characteristics, you must also subscribe to Building Footprints.\n\n3D Roof Characteristics\n\nIn Gen 3 data, a new attribute was introduced - Dominant Roof Pitch. This is calculated from our 3D data using a similar approach to the 3D attributes in AI Pack: Building Characteristics. See the description there for when and how the 3D related attributes are made available.\n\nDominant Roof Pitch\n\nMeasured in degrees from horizontal, this is the pitch of the largest area of the roof. It is calculated by assessing the surface normals of the roof area, and identifying the most prevalent surface normal. Where multiple pitches have been used in a roof, this will NOT provide an average - it will be (approximately) the most commonly appearing pitch by area.\n\nRoof Material\n\nRoof Material includes a group of three AI Layers:\n\nTile\n\nShingle\n\nMetal\n\nIt also includes a \"dominant roof material\" category in AI Parcel exports (both as a column in the spreadsheet and as an attribute associated with a building footprint polygon in the GeoPackage file), which can take the value of \"Tile\", \"Metal\", \"Shingle\" or \"Other\".\n\nThe Dominant roof material is the material taking up the largest horizontal area of the roof (as long as it covers at least 50% of the total area). So a mostly tile roof with a metal extension would be denoted as tile. If there is no clear dominant roof material, it is classified as \"Other\".\n\nCharacteristics and Recommended Use\n\nThe dominant roof material is provided to avoid confusion in the very common situation where a shingle or tile roof has a small metal extension. In some situations (due to lighting conditions for example) it can be very difficult to tell the difference between tile and shingle, or between metal and other fairly featureless roof types. This shows up as less bright areas in the AI Layer viewer. The dominant roof material simplifies this information by making the best choice of overall roof material given the information available.\n\nTiles are much less common in certain parts of the US, which means that the majority of roofs identified as tile are lower confidence. This is because a certain percentage of shingle roofs will always be mistaken for tile, and an absence of actual tile roofs means that these errors form a much larger percentage of those detected as tile.\n\nShingles are almost never used in Australia whereas they are the most common roof type in most parts of the US. This means that the majority of roofs in Australia identified as shingle are lower confidence. This is because a certain percentage of tile roofs will always be mistaken for shingle, and an absence of actual shingle roofs means that these errors form a much larger percentage of those detected as shingle.\n\nThe practical performance of the metal roof attribute varies with region, depending on how prevalent it is, and how common other roof materials are.\n\nThe lower number of \"Other\" roof material in Australia means that less of the \"Other\" predictions are confident (as Australia is almost exclusively tile, metal and concrete roofs).\n\nRoof Shape\n\nThe set of roof shape attributes each detects whether there is at least one structural element of the roof with one of these definitions.\n\nHip\n\nGable\n\nFlat\n\nTurret\n\nDutch Gable\n\nDormer Window\n\nTree Overhang\n\nTree Overhang can be defined as any case where there is some tree (leaf on or off) protruding over the top of a Building Footprint. A Tree Overhang AI Layer is available for viewing in MapBrowser . Polygons of tree overhang, as well as area estimates, are available in an AI Parcel export.\n\nCharacteristics and Recommended Use\n\nWhen presented as a \"Y\" or \"N\" flag in the CSV file, Tree Overhang may not be directly useful. It detects any amount of overlap at all, such that more than half of the properties in our coverage area are listed as having tree overhang. Where the overhang is used to identify trees that may need trimming, or calculating property risk, it is recommended you use the area estimate to set a meaningful threshold (e.g. only look at buildings with >10m2 of overhang). In more advanced use cases, you could use the area directly to rank properties from highest to lowest amount of overhang, or as a continuous variable to use in a statistical model. It is also possible to consider the shape and position of the tree overhang sections on the building, obtained from the geospatial file of exported AI Parcels.\n\nThe confidence values for Tree Overhang are particularly low, because the edges of trees that overhang a roof often fade out gradually between high confidence and very low confidence. The area estimate of Tree Overhang is recommended as a better means of adjusting whether mild, moderate or extreme overhang should be included for your particular application.\n\nLeaf-off Vegetation Overhang\n\nLeaf-off Vegetation Overhang is very similar to Tree Overhang in that it intersects the roof outline with the Leaf-off Vegetation layer. There are several key use cases for this data.",

    "# Comprehensive Analyst Report on Gable\n\n## Company Overview\n\nGable is a pioneering data contracts platform that focuses on proactive data quality management by implementing data contracts early in the data lifecycle. This approach allows teams to draft, define, and enforce data contracts, creating a collaborative environment for software developers, data engineers, and data scientists. Gable's unique perspective on data lineage provides visibility into data origins, transformations, and dependencies, effectively creating a proactive form of lineage tracking that starts at the source of data creation [(Gable.ai, 2023)](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-lineage-tools).\n\nGable is positioned within the rapidly growing data catalog market, which is projected to expand from $878.8 million in 2023 to $4,680.9 million by 2032, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.7% during this period [(Gable.ai, 2023)](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-lineage-tools).\n\n## Product Overview\n\nGable's product is centered around its data contracts platform, which is designed to enhance data quality and integrity by integrating directly into development workflows. This proactive approach aims to reduce costs and wasted effort by maintaining data integrity early in the process. However, as a relatively new entrant in the market, Gable may present a learning curve compared to more established tools [(Gable.ai, 2023)](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-lineage-tools).\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **Proactive Data Quality Management**: Gable emphasizes early implementation of data contracts to ensure data quality from the outset.\n- **Integration with Development Workflows**: The platform is designed to seamlessly integrate into existing development processes, enhancing collaboration among teams.\n- **Visibility into Data Lineage**: By defining and versioning data contracts, Gable provides insights into data origins and transformations, which is crucial for data governance and compliance [(Gable.ai, 2023)](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-lineage-tools).\n\n### Pros and Cons\n\n**Pros**:\n- Highly proactive approach to data quality.\n- Unique integration capabilities with development workflows.\n- Potential cost savings by maintaining data integrity early in the process.\n\n**Cons**:\n- Learning curve for new users due to its relative novelty in the market.\n- Pricing details are not publicly available; interested parties must join a waitlist for more information [(Gable.ai, 2023)](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-lineage-tools).\n\n## Financial Performance\n\nGable's parent company, G-Able Public Company Limited, reported significant financial growth in 2023, achieving an operating income of Baht 5,338 million, a 13% increase from the previous year. The company also generated a gross profit of Baht 1,099 million, maintaining a gross profit margin of approximately 21% [(GABLE, 2023)](https://www.g-able.com/insights/g-able-enable-the-future). \n\nThe backlog portion of Gable's income reached an all-time high of over Baht 4.5 billion, indicating strong future income potential. The company expects to generate over Baht 2,753 million in income in 2024, which accounts for nearly half of its target income for that year [(GABLE, 2023)](https://www.g-able.com/insights/g-able-enable-the-future).\n\n## Strategic Initiatives\n\nGable's strategy for 2024 focuses on becoming an AI-ready organization, emphasizing the integration of smart technologies and digital solutions. The company plans to expand its business application segment through global partnerships, particularly in human capital management (HCM) software, which is projected to grow at an average rate of 18% over the next three years [(GABLE, 2023)](https://www.g-able.com/insights/g-able-enable-the-future).\n\nDr. Chaiyuth Chunnahacha, CEO of G-Able Public Company Limited, stated, “Our main aim is to tap into our modern and smart technologies and digital solutions to serve future business needs, secure organizational data, increase profitability, and ensure sustainable growth of our clients in the AI-First era” [(GABLE, 2023)](https://www.g-able.com/insights/g-able-enable-the-future).\n\n## Market Position and Competitors\n\nGable operates in a competitive landscape that includes established players like Alation, Collibra, and Secoda, which offer comprehensive data lineage and governance solutions. While Gable's focus on data contracts is unique, it must compete with these established tools that provide robust data lineage capabilities and advanced visualization features [(Gable.ai, 2023)](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-lineage-tools).\n\n## Executive Insights\n\nThe leadership team at Gable, particularly Dr. Chaiyuth Chunnahacha, is focused on leveraging the company's technological capabilities to drive growth and innovation. The emphasis on proactive data quality management and integration into development workflows reflects a strategic vision aimed at addressing the evolving needs of data teams in organizations [(GABLE, 2023)](https://www.g-able.com/insights/g-able-enable-the-future).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nGable presents a compelling opportunity for prospective candidates and investors interested in the data management and governance space. With its innovative approach to data contracts and a strong financial performance, Gable is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for data lineage tools. However, potential users should be aware of the learning curve associated with adopting a new platform and the competitive landscape in which Gable operates. \n\nFor more information on Gable and its offerings, interested parties are encouraged to sign up for the product waitlist to receive updates on pricing and availability [(Gable.ai, 2023)](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-lineage-tools)."
