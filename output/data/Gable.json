      "# [What is DataOps? What Leaders Need to Know](https://www.gable.ai/blog/dataops)\nSomething interesting is taking place in the world of DataOps right now. A big something. But what’s really interesting is what’s at play behind the scenes.\n\nAccording to our friends at Global Market Insights (GMI), the calculated annual growth rate (CAGR) of the DataOps platform marketplace is projected to grow 22% from 2023 to 2032 (i.e., less than one decade). By comparison, this is potentially 1% more than the much-buzzed-about low-code application marketplace is projected to grow during the same time.\n\nHowever, the factors driving DataOps aren’t quite as clear compared to low-code.\n\nData orchestration capabilities need to keep pace with the growing volume and complexity of Big Data, and this is part of the reason for this exceptional amount of growth. Improving customer service and experience, increasing operational efficiency, and maintaining competitive advantages are ongoing priorities for businesses.\n\nHowever, this near-exponential investment in DataOps may be due to a reckoning between two other causal trends—the increasing business need for real-time data insights and the growing impact of data governance and compliance globally.\n\nTo better understand why, let’s start by breaking down DataOps, covering its core principles, best practices, and implementation challenges within modern organizations.\n\nA basic definition of DataOps\n\nFor those who work in leadership or data-adjacent teams, DataOps is a lot like shifted paradigms—no doubt you’ve heard it mentioned while doing business. However, lacking any direct experience, what exactly DataOps is may be less than clear. Let’s correct this now.\n\nDataOps is short for Data Operations. It is a process-oriented methodology that shares and builds on many characteristics of Agile methodologies, DevOps, and lean manufacturing. Simply, the goal of DataOps is to reduce the cycle time of data analytics. In practice, it does so by streamlining collection from data sources to consumption by data consumers.\n\nBroadly speaking, the DataOps process is driven through an organized emphasis on automation, collaboration, and communication. For good reason, this means DataOps and DevOps cross streams quite often in practice. Both are instrumental in keeping Big Data and business value from being at odds.\n\nWe’ve done our best to compare and contrast both processes elsewhere. But know that exploring the core pillars of DataOps helps clarify the distinct role it plays.\n\nCore principles of modern DataOps\n\nAndy Palmer coined the term \"DataOps\" in 2015, describing it as the intersection of data engineering, data quality, and data integration with a focus on various data professionals in a given organization communicating and collaborating to increase the velocity, reliability, and quality of data analytics.\n\nWhile the concept and practice of DataOps has evolved and expanded beyond Palmer’s definition the core principles that enable professionals to put DataOps into practice remain largely the same:\n\n1. Automation and Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)\n\nThe beating heart of DataOps is automation, which aims to reduce manual efforts related to data validation, integration, and deployment processes.\n\nThis often includes automating data ingestion, testing, monitoring, and deployment within a build/deployment pipeline to ensure both consistency and reliability.\n\n2. Agile and lean methodologies\n\nPractitioners work to streamline data management processes by incorporating agile and lean methodologies.\n\nAgile’s focus on flexibility, continuous improvement, and the delivery of high-quality products in short cycles enables data teams to accelerate experimentation and adaptation based on feedback. Lean methodologies, in turn, guide teams to streamline data pipelines, minimize inefficiencies, and ensure that data delivery remains firmly coupled to business needs.\n\n3. Collaboration and alignment\n\nEffective DataOps encourages a culture of collaboration and alignment among cross-functional teams, which typically includes data engineers, scientists, and business stakeholders.\n\nFostering collaboration in this fashion ensures data products align with business needs and that data analysts can deliver all insights efficiently.\n\n4. Cloud-first and scalable infrastructure\n\nModern DataOps ecosystems should prioritize cloud-based solutions for optimal scalability and flexibility.\n\nThis principle specifically supports distributed data processing and storage, enabling organizations to scale data operations as needed.\n\n5. Highly automated and continuous processes\n\nDataOps ecosystems should feature high levels of automation to manage the scale and scope of enterprise data efficiently and effectively.\n\nIn practice, this often includes automating the cataloging, movement, and organization of data, in addition to testing and releasing processes.\n\n6. Openness and interoperability\n\nAn ecosystem in which DevOps practitioners leverage best-in-class, open-source, and potentially free tools is essential for innovation. The inverse also holds true—DataOps practitioners should avoid reliance on single, proprietary platforms (as opposed to a variety of tools that are easy to integrate and replace).\n\nThis ease of integration should also apply to a broad spectrum of potential data sources (e.g., data lakes, data warehouses) to improve data quality and governance.\n\n7. Data quality and governance\n\nImplementing robust data governance guidelines and practices is essential to ensure high data quality.\n\nAt a minimum, governance should involve data validation, cleaning, and reconciliation processes which can ensure accuracy and reliability throughout the data lifecycle.\n\n8. Ephemeral environments and code reuse\n\nEphemeral environments are temporary by nature, so using them for testing further enhances flexibility and accelerates development. As such, they reduce the risk of conflicts between environments while promoting resource efficiency.\n\nCode reuse helps practitioners maintain consistency, reduce errors, and save time by avoiding duplications of effort. Additionally, containerization encapsulates applications and their dependencies into containers that can run reliably in different computing environments.\n\n9. Monitoring, observability, and customer centricity\n\nDataOps practitioners should prioritize continuous monitoring and observability of data pipelines, ensuring data availability, performance, and security. This is vital for identifying, addressing, and resolving issues as quickly as possible.\n\nWhile DataOps practitioners focus on reducing cycle times for data delivery, enabling faster insights, and improving data-driven decision-making, ultimately everything done must remain rooted in delivering value to the organization’s end-users and customers.\n\nBeing such an elemental aspect of any data practice, it’s also beneficial to explore how other data leaders articulate their core principles of DataOps. For an excellent perspective to which we can compare and contrast the above, we recommend looking at DataKitchen’s seminal DataOps Cookbook (that is, after finishing our own article, here, of course).\n\nDataOps best practices\n\nIf core principles are one side of the DataOps coin, best practices are the other. Without them, no amount of core principles would allow organizations to actively streamline their data management processes, accelerate their insight generation, and (perhaps most fundamentally) improve data quality.\n\nBecause of this, DataOps best practices naturally intertwine with the principles outlined above. But the key best practices are still worth detailing, as they are applicable across industries and organizations:\n\nFoster a collaborative culture\n\nThe existence of departmental silos within organizations is understandable. But they aren’t acceptable. This is why DataOps best practices begin by breaking down obstacles and fostering communication and collaboration between teams—data engineers, data scientists, business users, stakeholders, and operations.\n\nDataOps makes data quality and accessibility a shared responsibility across an organization, which, in turn, sets the stage for all best practices that follow.\n\nAdopt a customer-centric approach\n\nToo often, adopting a customer-centric approach emerges as an afterthought in the practice of DataOps. This borders on being a tragic irony, as the benefits of DataOps itself—enhanced value delivery, promoting agility and responsiveness, driving innovation, fueling trust and loyalty, etc.—can only be fully realized by engaging with end-users to understand their needs, challenges, and desires.\n\nImplement agile methodologies\n\nLook to agile practices like sprints and scrums to manage data projects, allowing for rapid iteration and responses to change. Practitioners can also use Agile approaches to prioritize work based on business needs and value.\n\nHowever, it bears noting that when practitioners seek to leverage Agile as a DataOps best practice, they must ensure its impact is balanced and holistic within the organization. When employed dogmatically, these Agile methodologies can muddle the practice of proper documentation, over-complicate data management, erode data quality for the sake of responsiveness, and potentially introduce security and compliance risks.\n\nFor these reasons, make sure that Agile within your organization is used as part of the overall DataOps solution, not a solution unto itself.\n\nAutomate data pipelines\n\nActively implement CI/CD pipelines in order to automate data integration, testing, deployment, and monitoring processes. In addition to this best practice of reducing manual efforts and errors, CI/CD pipelines help ensure seamless, automated updates and deployments.\n\nEmbrace continuous testing\n\nLeverage automation to test data quality, data integration, and performance throughout the organization’s data lifecycle.\n\nFurthermore, test-driven development (TDD) approaches should be adopted for data-related code and pipelines. TDD encourages earlier issue identification and potential integration issues while contributing to overall data quality.\n\nMake version control ubiquitous\n\nTrack changes and facilitate collaboration by utilizing version control for all data assets—code, configurations, and data modeling, to name a few.\n\nAdditionally, data versioning strategies should be considered to manage changes in datasets. Doing so enables reproducibility and replicability, supports the experimentation and iteration that DataOps champions, and allows organizations to demonstrate the lineage and provenance of their data.\n\nObsessively monitor data quality and performance\n\nThe ability to identify and solution for issues quickly requires the continuous monitoring of pipeline performance and data quality.\n\nEstablishing key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics related to quality is itself key for operationalizing effective monitoring capabilities.\n\nEnsure data security and compliance\n\nData security, privacy, and compliance checks should be embedded through data pipelines to protect sensitive information while helping the organization comply with all relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).\n\nThese compliance checks also require regular reviews, and security practices must be updated to keep pace with ever-evolving threats and regulations.\n\nInvest in scalable and flexible infrastructure\n\nUtilize cloud services and technologies that bolster operational pillars of effective DataOps, scalability, optimal data processing, and organizational flexibility.\n\nIn doing so, data teams should consider adopting data virtualization and containerization capabilities to improve agility and resource efficiency.\n\nLeverage metadata management while planning for growth\n\nWork to implement robust metadata management practices to improve data discoverability, understanding, and governance.\n\nAs part of planning for future (perhaps inevitable) growth, design data architectures and systems to allow for easy adaption and scaling. Use metadata to automate data lineage, data cataloging, and impact analysis.\n\nEmbrace ongoing learning\n\nAs part of laying the foundations for future growth, DataOps initiatives should encourage team members to continually seek out, evaluate, and adopt emerging technologies and practices that will benefit the organization over time.\n\nDataOps is a journey, not a destination. As such, opportunities and areas of improvement should always be identified as part of a culture of testing, learning, and growing.\n\nCommon roadblocks to DataOps implementation (and how data contracts help)\n\nWhether an organization is just getting off the ground or has already experienced some measure of success, DataOps practices may be poorly defined or functionality non-existent. This is also common and commonly attributed to one or a combination of many of the challenges that follow. Fortunately, drafting and implementing a robust data contract can help in all cases.\n\nChange-averse cultures\n\nIt’s not uncommon for progressive thinkers to face resistance from within when trying to inspire a shift towards more collaborative, agile approaches to data management. Reluctance to adopt new processes (even those that are clearly beneficial) in addition to existing departmental silos can hinder DataOps initiatives before they can even begin.\n\nIn these situations, the data contract drafting process can act as a cultural balm, as it necessitates a clear definition of expectations, responsibilities, and roles of all parties involved in data management and usage (not just those directly involved in data analytics). The drafting process also mitigates resistance to new workflows by setting and/or codifying standardized processes all stakeholders must agree upon.\n\nSkill or knowledge deficits\n\nEven a modest implementation of DataOps requires a healthy mix of skills that span data engineering, data science, software development, and operations. Depending on their size or maturity, an organization may lack the diverse skill set and experience needed to integrate these distinct disciplines effectively.\n\nNo data contract is capable of directly addressing gaps in skills and experience. The implementation of data contracts does, however, clarify standards and requirements for data security, access, and quality. As such, they can indirectly guide employee training and development.\n\nInadequate data governance\n\nAs mentioned, effective DataOps relies on the foundation of solid data governance. Therefore, organizations may struggle to implement governance frameworks that are both robust and agile enough to support modern DataOps practices.\n\nData contracts directly support governance within an organization by establishing clear guidelines for data usage, sharing, and management. The framework for compliance and data quality standards established as they’re drafted makes governance more actionable and aligned with ensuing DataOps goals.\n\nComplexities regarding data integration\n\nThe ability to integrate data from a variety of sources presents significant technical challenges, especially in complex or legacy IT environments. This complexity can stall the progress of DataOps implementation by making data pipelines hard to manage or brittle.\n\nConversely, data contracts simplify integration efforts by specifying data interfaces, standards, and formats. This ensures that raw data from any number of sources will be compatible with the organization’s data infrastructure and can be processed and analyzed with optimal efficiency.\n\nPervasive data quality issues\n\nPoor data quality is (unfortunately) a common challenge in the business world, undermining analytics and eroding trust in data-driven decision-making. This can be an open secret too, with employees painfully aware of the issues substandard data is causing while struggling to quantify what exactly is to blame.\n\nThe metrics, validation processes, and remediation steps for non-compliance that data contracts define can make this a non-issue within organizations. This proactive approach (which is always ideal, especially in enterprise data environments) quickly becomes instrumental in maintaining high data quality across the organization.\n\nDifficulties in scaling data operations\n\nFinally, as organizations grow, it’s increasingly challenging to scale data operations efficiently while maintaining data quality. DataOps aims to address scalability issues but, ironically, a lack of foresight and flexibility regarding processes and infrastructure can prevent this from happening.\n\nData contracts circumvent these issues through the guidelines and expectations for data infrastructure, processing capabilities, and performance metrics they crystalize. This ensures that as the volume of data an organization must subsist on grows, systems and processes adapt and scale accordingly.\n\nDrafting an optimal DataOps process\n\nIt’s clear that DataOps functions best at the genetic level of data-driven organizations. It’s also clear that, given such high stakes in the market, business leaders should be doing everything in their power to get their own DataOps right.\n\nAs covered in the last section, data contracts serve as an excellent solution to ensure this happens. That said, the benefits these contracts bring to a data-centric organization extend far beyond DataOps.\n\nFor a quick, digestible, informative primer on data contracts, give Why Data Leaders Opt for Ounces Over Pounds a read.\n\nThis article is part of our blog at Gable.ai — where our goal is to create a shared data culture of collaboration, accountability, quality, and governance.\n\nCurrently, our industry-first approach to drafting and implementing data contracts is in private Beta.",
      "# [About Gable](https://www.gable.ai/about-gable)\nGable co-founders Chad (CEO), Adrian (CTO), Daniel (Founding Engineer), and James (CPO) have worked in data organizations for large companies, startups, research, and technology companies.\n\nData is incredibly important in driving all aspects of the business in all of these firms. Data drives decisions and everything from pricing to analytics and day-to-day operations.\n\nDespite this, data scientists, analysts, and data engineers were constantly dealing with data quality, data governance, and change management issues stemming from issues with upstream source data.\n\nWith over 50 years of combined data platform experience, the group realized that the data industry’s approach to managing data lags 15 years behind software engineering.\n\nData contracts, integration testing, unit testing, diffs, and monitoring were sorely lacking outside the Data Warehouse. This caused data quality issues to cascade from upstream sources into the analytical environment, spurring an overflow of failed tests and randomly changing data - a problem that made data products fundamentally unscalable.\n\nShortly after, Gable was born to create a data culture of collaboration, accountability, quality, and governance.",
      "# [Federated Data: Advantages for Data Leaders](https://www.gable.ai/blog/federated-data)\nRobust data management is important for any data-driven organization. But for compliance-conscious organizations (e.g., those in finance or healthcare), it is now bordering on essential.\n\nFor this reason, and in these industries, federated data is gaining traction as teams look to bolster their ability to manage and maintain high-quality data at scale.\n\nBut what about federated data specifically is making this so? What difference is it actually making in highly compliant, data-driven industries? And will data teams in other industries soon see the federation of their data as a solid option or a serious need?\n\nLet's find out.\n\nWhat is federated data?\n\nFederated data in data engineering refers to a system that provides unified access to data spread across multiple, often diverse sources without requiring the physical movement or consolidation of that data into a central repository.\n\nInstead, data federation relies on a virtual layer that connects and abstracts these sources, allowing engineering teams and data consumers to work with a unified view of their data—using it just as if it were housed in a single, cohesive system.\n\nThis approach enables organizations that rely on high data quality to leverage comprehensive insights while maintaining control over data location, governance, and compliance. For these reasons, data leaders are turning to federated data as an adaptable solution for today’s complex, data-driven environments.\n\nHow does federated data work?\n\nThe ability to provide unified access and control involving differing data sources (without any need for data consolidation) relies on four key components acting in concert. Let’s walk through them.\n\nData fabric\n\nWithin an organization's overall data environment, the data fabric establishes a singular overarching operational infrastructure. This is important, as even simple data environments (by today's standards) are composed of multiple ecosystems, such as on-premises servers, cloud platforms, and hybrid setups.\n\nEach of these ecosystems, in turn, can host a variety of data sources, including data lakes, warehouses, IoT devices, and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. The operative role of the data fabric is to integrate and manage these ecosystems and their underlying data sources, ensuring secure and seamless data integration and comprehensive data governance across the data environment as a whole.\n\nA federation layer\n\nSpecific software operating within the data fabric framework introduces a federation layer that acts as a query engine, breaking down user queries into subqueries tailored for each data source within the data fabric.\n\nThis engine retrieves the results from these subqueries in real time, aggregating them into a unified response. By doing so, the federation layer ensures that users can interact with distributed datasets as if they were part of a single system.\n\nData virtualization layers\n\nTypically, this same software will also add abstraction layers above each distributed data source in the data environment. These technical mechanisms (i.e., virtualization layers) first translate each federation query into source-specific formats before abstracting the response back to the federation layer in a standardized format.\n\nAs a result, users can access and query data through the federation layer without moving or duplicating the actual data from its source.\n\nMetadata management\n\nFinally, as all this takes place, the data fabric's metadata management maintains consistency while sourcing and using the federated data within an organization.\n\nThis is key because the metadata repositories store information about each dataset's structure, format, and governance policies, enabling the federation engine to execute queries accurately across various sources with different schemas.\n\nFederated vs. centralized data management: 5 reasons data federation comes out on top\n\nNow that we’ve discussed how federated data typically works within an organization, we can stress the strategic advantages it has over more traditional, centralized data management.\n\n1. Superior strategic flexibility and scalability\n\nData leaders and data-adjacent stakeholders (e.g., chief data officers, VPs of data, chief data and analytics officers) face significant challenges in effectively managing the growth and complexity of data assets across multiple ecosystems.\n\nFor these reasons, centralized data management practices struggle to keep pace as this growth increases the resources needed to shepherd organizational data into a single location (e.g., a data warehouse or lake). Even for organizations that can afford the ongoing investment to do this, the traditionally centralized approach can’t, by design, accommodate new data sources with the flexibility today’s data-driven organizations require.\n\nAlternately, the flexibility and out-of-the-box agility to scale that’s inherent in data federation is ideal for data leaders, as it provides the adaptability they need to evolve data sources and business needs without additional investment or restructuring of infrastructure.\n\n2. Enhanced compliance, governance, and data security\n\nCompliance-focused executives often struggle with the complex regulatory requirements of enterprise data, which dictate how organizations must store and access their data. And, here, too, the consolidation of information in centralized data management practices can cause issues. Centralization of data creates accessibility challenges (i.e., who may access data, when, and why) and heightens risk exposure, especially when data must travel from region to region or transcontinentally. Moreover, data consolidation in this manner relies on strict, resource-intensive security measures that are robust enough to protect sensitive information, especially for financial and healthcare organizations, where common use cases include real-time analytics, regulatory reporting, and cross-functional data collaboration.\n\nBy contrast, data federation allows organizations to keep data in its original location, simplifying compliance by enabling control over data location. This decentralized approach supports more agile, region-specific compliance with regulations like GDPR and HIPAA while still providing (if not improving) accessibility or flexibility.\n\n3. Improved cross-functional data collaboration\n\nThe data needs of some organizations are heavily cross-departmental. Within the walls of these large yet dynamic businesses (think Coca-Cola, Netflix, or Amazon), fostering effective data collaboration is a must for operational alignment and productivity.\n\nHere again, centralized models fail to deliver in the world of big data. In these environments, centralized models rely on data flowing through a central data team, which creates bottlenecks in managing access control, as teams must wait for permissions to access consolidated datasets. This centralization also reduces agility as other departments and end users wait for the team to move, prepare, and organize data.\n\nContrast this with a federated data model that, by enabling decentralized data access, allows departments like finance, marketing, and operations to interact with the data they need in real time without depending on a central team to manage it.\n\nThis structure supports a more collaborative and self-sufficient approach to data use, empowering departments with the Netflixes and Amazons of the world to work more effectively while aligning with organizational governance standards.\n\n4. Faster time-to-insight for business agility\n\nOrganizations are regaining agility and flexibility while staying compliant, turning this capability into a competitive advantage. By generating and acting on real-time insights faster and more decisively, they enhance the utility of their data environments. Unfortunately, centralized systems stumble and fail when tasked with performing in this way.\n\nDespite everyone's best efforts, time-intensive ETL pipeline processes may create unacceptable delays by routing data through multiple stages of transformation before it reaches its central repository for use.\n\nFor financial organizations, data delays can cost millions of dollars by compromising leadership's ability to make effective decisions. This erosion of decision-making impacts customer satisfaction and complicates efforts to remain compliant. In healthcare, these delays can be even more dire, potentially costing lives as they disrupt operational efficiency in care facilities, hinder patient care, and slow the delivery of critical health insights to those who need them most.\n\nIn these high-stakes environments, federated data systems free organizations to work at the speed of innovation by reducing latency and accelerating time-to-insight, which empowers teams to act quickly and make data-informed decisions.\n\n5. Optimized costs and resource allocation\n\nFinally, every leader in modern organizations is responsible for justifying budgets and resource allocation, especially as data volumes continue to grow.\n\nCentralized data management requires significant investments in infrastructure for storage, processing, and security, as well as additional costs for ETL operations to consolidate data. When data sources multiply, as they so commonly do, these expenses naturally increase, leading to duplicated storage and higher operational costs.\n\nIn contrast, data federation reduces the need for extensive infrastructure as it allows data to remain in its original location. By minimizing data duplication and streamlining resource allocation, federated data creates efficiencies that drive cost savings, which is a valuable benefit for any executive looking to optimize their technology budgets. That is, all data executives, everywhere.\n\nFunctionality, flexibility, and future-forward thinking with Gable.ai\n\nFederated systems are just one example of how industry leaders are embracing smarter ways to keep their companies agile and intelligent, as opposed to simply throwing more time, energy, and resources at the event horizon of big data.\n\nWhile this is imperative for data leaders in industries like finance and healthcare, leaders in every industry should consider how the right strategic investments upstream can have exponentially impactful results as they ripple downstream.",
      "# [4 Best Data Producer Practices to Improve Your Data Quality](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-producers)\nData engineering teams and data producers can find it hard to collaborate within an organization for a number of reasons.\n\nPoor data quality is one of them.\n\nFor example, a customer’s address may be recorded incorrectly, which can affect their delivery. Sometimes, there are inconsistent data formats (e.g., inconsistency between two datasets). These issues can make data integration tricky and hamper data analytics. As a consequence, you risk dealing with outages and lose a lot of time that goes into fixing things.\n\nThat’s precisely why you need to gain a thorough understanding of data producers, assess their relationship with data consumers, and follow best practices for data producers to minimize data quality issues and improve your data management.\n\nWho and what are data producers?\n\nA data producer is anything that collects, processes, generates, and stores data that’s relevant to your organization and makes it available for data consumers. This can be a user interface, service, device, system—or human.\n\nData producers serve a key role in data lifecycle as the main source of truth. This information is fed into analysis and decision-making processes. Since data producers often generate unstructured data or raw data, it needs to undergo further processing in order to derive meaningful insights from it.\n\nFor example, a point-of-sale (PoS) system is a data producer for a retail company. It generates raw data in the form of sales transaction records, including customer information, product ID, and purchase details. You can perform processing and analysis on this data via customer segmentation or sales trend analysis to understand consumer buying behavior.\n\nSoftware engineers, on the other hand, are also data producers because they develop and maintain systems and applications that generate large amounts of data. They create transactional databases, message queues like Kafka topics, and other tools that produce data.\n\nData producers vs. data consumers\n\nWhile data producers generate data, a data consumer is an entity that uses it. Data consumers copy this data, perform data transformations on it, or send it to other systems. Some examples of data consumers include marketing automation platforms, BI platforms, data analysts, and data scientists. In the case of data analysts, Python, SQL, and other tools can analyze, transform, or visualize data.\n\nTechnical overview of data producers\n\nConsider an ecommerce website that uses a database to store product information, customer profiles, and transaction records. The website's API serves as the intermediary, enabling seamless communication between the database and the front-end interface. The website provides users with a user-friendly interface to browse products, add items to their cart, and complete purchases.\n\nWhen it comes to data producers, your data follows a unidirectional path. In other words, data only flows upstream or downstream at any given time. In this example, the data follows a unidirectional flow, starting from the database, where product information and customer details are stored. The API then processes this data and delivers it to the front-end interface, allowing users to view product listings, add items to their cart, and make purchases. User interactions with the front-end interface, such as selecting products and completing payments, are returned to the API and then stored in the database.\n\nWhat you should keep in mind is that a data producer can function as a data consumer in a different context. The database functions as the data producer when it generates and stores data for the website. The API is the data consumer when it retrieves the data from the database.\n\nHowever, the API becomes the data producer when the front-end interface (acting as a data consumer) calls it to retrieve data. Similarly, the front-end interface can become a data producer for the customer who is now the data consumer that goes through the information provided on the website.\n\nData producer examples\n\nData producers can consist of any of the following:\n\nSoftware engineers act as data producers when they develop applications or systems that generate data during user interactions.\n\nSales associates contribute as data producers when they record customer interactions and sales transactions into company systems. The data they generate helps to improve customer relationship management and boost sales.\n\nCustomers become data producers by interacting with the company’s platforms via online purchases and social media engagement. Their activities generate valuable data on user preferences, behaviors, and feedback. This data helps to analyze and improve customer experience in the future.\n\nBest practices for data producers\n\nStruggling to maintain standardized data formats and failing to streamline data integration can leave your organization behind the curve and impact your decision-making processes. Data engineering managers should consider the following best practices for data producers to improve data management within their organization.\n\n1. Understand your data sources\n\nYou need to understand your data sources when it comes to data producers. When you assess how the data was created and its context, you can identify potential inaccuracies, biases, or limitations.\n\nFor instance, an automated employee attendance tracking system is a data producer. The system serves as the data producer by generating and recording employee attendance data. Understanding the data source—in this case, a biometric attendance system—allows the office management to identify any potential inaccuracies or limitations. They might recognize that the system may not be able to capture nuanced attendance details, such as the reasons for late arrivals. By reviewing these limitations, office management can implement relevant initiatives such as periodic manual checks to provide more accurate information for data producers.\n\n2. Introduce metadata management\n\nMetadata management provides context and information about the data. It helps data producers understand the structure, meaning, and relationships within a dataset. For instance, data producers, such as customer service agents, need to know how the customer data is organized with the CRM system.\n\nMetadata management includes documenting and categorizing different data types within the CRM system via a data catalog. This can help agents understand whether the data is numerical, textual, or categorical. They can also learn about relationships between different data entities. For example, it can uncover how customer data is linked to past purchases or interactions.\n\n3. Implement data quality assurance\n\nData quality assurance is an ongoing process to ensure data is accurate, reliable, consistent, and relevant. It includes using a wide range of techniques and practices to maintain and improve the quality of data that producers generate. This process involves validating data at the point of entry, identifying and resolving errors within it, and ensuring it remains consistent across different systems throughout the organization.\n\nConsider a financial firm where a transaction monitoring system serves as a data producer. The system generates data on customer transactions, account activities, and financial operations. Implementing data quality assurance in this context includes validating how accurate the transaction data is, ensuring data is standardized and consistent across different accounts, and detecting any potential fraudulent activities. This can be done through real-time transaction monitoring, anomaly detection algorithms, and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance checks.\n\n4. Use a data collaboration management platform\n\nGartner analysts predict that by next year, 50% of businesses will embrace a modern data quality solution.\n\nAfter GitHub was launched in 2008, it quickly became a must-have tool for software development teams throughout the world for companies of all scales. GitHub helped teams to manage and track code effectively in a collaborative environment.\n\nSimilar to how GitHub was highly needed for software teams, there’s a need for a collaboration management tool for data teams. Fortunately, Gable.ai fills this vacuum. Gable.ai can bridge the gap between data producers and data consumers. By introducing data contracts and a data collaboration system, the platform can help to improve data quality, consistency, and communication.\n\nFor example, if you have an order processing system as a data producer and an inventory management system as a data consumer, Gable.ai can create data contracts for them. These contracts define specific data parameters that are required by the inventory system and ensure that the order processing system produces data according to its needs.\n\nRevolutionize the way you communicate data between your data producers and consumers",
      "# [Data Debt: What Is it and How to Avoid It](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-debt)\nAccruing data debt might be the cost of doing business in today's digital economy. But, just like its financial cousin, data debt can cost a business dearly if left unmanaged.\n\nAnd, while the monetary analogy makes for a helpful onramp, it's crucial to appreciate the unique and specific impacts data debt has on organizations. While gaining this appreciation, it's also essential to differentiate data debt from technical debt—an analog that occurs in data engineering and software departments.\n\nData debt, to begin with, refers to shortcuts and compromises made within an organization related to data quality, data architecture, and data management in an effort to accelerate access to data. As opposed to creating immediate issues, data debt accumulates over time and can create significant, long-term challenges that, ironically, \"seem to come out of nowhere.\" And, while a majority of modern business models are susceptible to these effects, data debt is particularly troublesome within organizations for whom accessible, reliable, high-quality data is mission-critical.\n\nAlternatively, for technical debt, the causal decisions often involve hardware and software-related factors. While the \"costs\" associated with correcting technical debt can impact an entire organization, the damage inherent in data debt can be far more insidious.\n\nData is increasingly—if not overwhelmingly—fueling the engines of modern business. Poor data quality, compounded by an accumulation of data debt, compromises data-driven decision-making.\n\nWhat's more, left unchecked, data issues can also lead to operational inefficiencies, hamper scalability, harm customer trust, increase security and compliance risks, and more.\n\nFor these reasons, proactively handling data debt should be considered mission-critical. And the ability to do so hinges on helping stakeholders appreciate the multitude of ways data debt can damage an organization.\n\n13 symptoms that may mean data debt is sinking the ship\n\nIntegration issues: When a company moves to adopt new tools or systems, data debt begins to complicate the integration process, leading to delays, complexity, and errors. This same situation can occur when two companies merge and are forced to reconcile two drastically different data systems.\n\nProject delays: Projects in highly data-dependent departments (e.g., IT and product development) may be the first to slow down, be put on hold, or begin going over budget as teams increasingly deal with inconsistencies or proper data hygiene.\n\nSystem degradation: Data debt can begin to compound data integrity, creating malfunctions, service errors and outages, or even complete system failures.\n\nPoor decision-making: It’s admirable when an organization’s leadership tries to use data to make better decisions. But data debt can begin empowering sub-optimal strategies and actions that cause more harm than good. In this sense, no data truly is better than bad data.\n\nMissed opportunities: As data grows untrustworthy or begins to lag behind real time, leadership will also struggle to capitalize on market trends, competitive intel, or the evolving needs of their own customers.\n\nReduced productivity: Employees who end up (re)cleaning, transforming, and validating data are spending less time on their own tasks. As data debt snowballs, inefficiencies and lessening throughput do as well.\n\nIncreasing operational costs: The constant rework needed to counteract an organization’s growing debt begins increasing direct costs like bringing in more resources to help, and indirect costs related to lost time and effort.\n\nSecurity vulnerabilities: Data debt can begin to erode overall security, leading to lax user access management, inadequate encryption, or outdated data storage protocols that begin exposing the organization to unacceptable amounts of risk.\n\nRegulatory and legal issues: Common debt contributors make it exceptionally difficult to handle user data with the same level of integrity and transparency once limited to a few specific industries, like finance and health care. But, while the scope of who needs to clear regulatory bars has changed, the consequences of failing to do so haven’t, often resulting in severe penalties and/or fines.\n\nDecreasing employee morale: We’ve touched on impacts ranging from projects and processes to workflows and costs. Unfortunately, data debt can also announce itself through the toll it takes on employee wellbeing. Frustration builds as day-to-day employees continually deal with data-related fire drills, leading to low morale and updated LinkedIn accounts.\n\nDissatisfied customers: Ongoing data issues eventually leech out through the walls of the organization as billing mishaps, ineffective customer support, misleading product recommendations, and poor customer experience begin frustrating customers.\n\nBrand reputation damage: The same data quality issues that begin to eat away at customer satisfaction can also harm an organization’s reputation within its industry. This, in turn, puts the screws to customer acquisition and retention.\n\nDulling competitive edge: Companies that manage data effectively generate insights faster, utilize them better, respond to market changes quicker, and not only innovate but do so more rapidly. For organizations drowning in data debt, the exact opposite holds true. And it’s these organizations that, sooner or later, find themselves losing step with competitors.\n\nBest practices for managing data debt\n\nFortunately, despite all the factors that can contribute to data debt within an organization, there is an array of best practices that business leaders can champion to counteract debt’s ability to accrue. Broadly, these best practices can be lumped into three categories: procedural, technological, and cultural. Or, as it’s commonly known in reference to digital transformation, “people, processes, and technologies.”\n\nProcedural best practices\n\nThese best practices begin and end with instituting and supporting a robust data governance framework. To counteract data debt, this framework needs to clearly outline all methodologies, use cases, procedures, and policies related to the data lifecycle.\n\nThe governance framework should be employee-accessible, ensuring individuals at all levels of the organization understand data standards and how they can avoid contributing to poor-quality data. These efforts should also include training and workshops, so the entire organization gets on (and stays on) the same page regarding data management best practices.\n\nAs you develop your governance framework, put a system in place for documenting how data is collected, processed, and stored. Plan to use this system as a foundation for clear data lineage procedures in order to benefit from the ability to trace and map data’s unique journey throughout your organization.\n\nProcedures also need to account for data retention policies, outlining where data should be retained, for how long, and whether it should eventually be archived or deleted entirely. Audit processes should then be put in place so that data is regularly reviewed for consistency, accuracy, and relevance.\n\nTechnological best practices\n\nNext, turn your attention to tools and technology that actively work against data debt. Ideally, this begins by modernizing your data infrastructure. Data should be migrated carefully from any legacy systems to more agile, efficient, and scalable systems. And cloud-based solutions continue to make this increasingly easy to implement.\n\nConsider introducing data integration platforms to keep the merging, cleaning, and integration of data from different sources streamlined over time. Metadata management systems make it easier to manage, store, and access valuable context about data as it flows into, and through, your organization. Use data quality tools and automated data validation so that new data is validated against a specific set of standards, and corrected automatically when those standards aren’t met.\n\nAnd while access to data documentation and context should be widely available, access to the data itself shouldn’t be. By implementing access control tools you can dial in user permissions, ensuring only specified individuals can access and modify data.\n\nCultural best practices\n\nWith proper processes and technologies in place, you must absolutely address the human element inherent in an organization’s data debt.\n\nStart with buy-in from leadership because data quality is everyone’s responsibility. Without executives and stakeholders making this clear, data quality within an organization will rot from the roots up—diligent, day-to-day processes ultimately keep organizational data aligned with the truth. It’s important, then, to ensure top management commits and is ready to take accountability for their organization’s data debt. Leadership will also need to ensure best practices are funded and adopted.\n\nWith leadership behind these efforts, a culture of data ownership can actually be fostered. As employees begin to benefit from data debt mitigation, it will be easier for peers to hold each other accountable for good data management and contributing to data quality.\n\nAs this sense of ownership takes hold, encourage a collaborative environment where departments work together on data projects, as this requires unified standards, promotes data literacy, and breaks down silos.\n\nKeep communication channels open so that your increasingly empowered employees can easily suggest improvements and report data issues as they arise. Comparing and contrasting feedback from different departments can uncover valuable insights. And, finally, actively reward data hygiene.\n\nA natural by-product of these best practices is that the idea of data quality and data debt will become much more tangible. Reinforce this tangibility by recognizing and rewarding teams and individuals who maintain the highest standards of data quality and management.\n\nData contracts: 10 ways better data agreements and specifications are paving a data debt-free future\n\nData contracts can play a pivotal role in minimizing or mitigating data debt. At its core, a data contract is a formal agreement or specification that outlines the format, structure, and semantics of data. They are particularly important when different systems or services interact with one another, ensuring a standardized and expected format of data exchange. Here's how they can help:\n\nStandardization: Data contracts ensure a consistent structure, which means that data from different sources or teams adheres to a unified format. This reduces discrepancies and inconsistencies, a common form of data debt.\n\nValidation: Data contracts can be used as a validation mechanism, ensuring that incoming or outgoing data meets specific criteria or standards before processing. This can prevent inaccurate or corrupt data from entering the system.\n\nDocumentation: A well-defined data contract serves as a form of documentation that’s version controlled, clarifying how data should be structured, what each attribute means, and any constraints on the data. This reduces the chances of misunderstandings or misinterpretations.\n\nInteroperability: As organizations grow, they may integrate multiple systems, tools, or external services. Data contracts ensure seamless integration by setting clear expectations about how data should be sent and received between systems.\n\nReduction in ambiguity: With clear data contracts, there's less guesswork or ambiguity involved in how data should be managed or understood, reducing the risk of errors.\n\nEasier troubleshooting: When issues arise, having a data contract in place makes it easier to pinpoint deviations from the expected data format, speeding up troubleshooting and resolution processes. Contracts also ensure that the correct data owners are contacted based on the specific issues at hand.\n\nSupport for evolution: As data needs change, data contracts can be versioned, allowing for organized transitions and updates. This ensures that even as changes occur, there's a clear record of different data formats and structures over time.\n\nEfficiency in collaboration: When different teams or departments collaborate, having clear data contracts reduces friction and misunderstandings. Everyone knows what to expect, ensuring smoother collaboration.\n\nTransparency and trust: For consumers of the data (which might be internal teams or external partners), a clear contract gives confidence in the data's consistency and quality, fostering trust.\n\nEnhanced compliance: For industries with stringent regulatory requirements around data, having clear data contracts can assist in ensuring compliance by setting and following clear data standards.\n\nTo harness these benefits, it's essential to ensure that data contracts are kept up-to-date, widely accessible to relevant stakeholders, and strictly enforced.\n\nAnd that’s the core principle Gable was designed to address.

Data modeling: An overview\n\nAt one point in the not-too-distant past, data modeling was the cornerstone of any data management strategy. Due to the technical and business practices that were predominant at the end of the 21st century, data modeling at its zenith placed a strong emphasis on structured, well-defined models.\n\nHowever, in the late 2000s, the emergence of major cloud service providers like Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) enabled cloud computing to gain traction within business organizations.\n\nBy the end of that same decade, the benefits of scaleable, on-demand computing resources led to a proper surge within business organizations, which then led to the proliferation of what is now commonly referred to as the modern data stack—a group of cloud-based tools and technologies used for the collection, storage, processing, and analysis of data.\n\nCompared to the at-the-push-of-a-button benefits available on demand, data modeling was then seen by a growing number of practitioners as rigid and inflexible. Data modeling takes time. It can get complicated. The costs and overheads associated with the process reflected this. Perhaps most damaging at the time, it became easy to frame data modeling as a bottleneck—dead weight hampering the speed and flexibility of modern data management.\n\nHowever, this overemphasis on speed and flexibility and the underutilization of data modeling wasn’t sustainable. Though there is no specific “breaking point” to point to, by the mid-2010s, these issues became increasingly attributable to data modeling’s diminution.\n\nWhile far from exhaustive, increasingly common factors helped to precipitate this recalibration in the data space:\n\nData governance challenges: The abundance of cloud-based data storage and processing fueled an explosive increase in the data sources and repositories the average organization had access to. This sudden abundance, in turn, intensified the maintenance of data quality, security, and compliance, irreparably complicating the governance process.\n\nData quality issues: The fevered rate at which cloud-based solutions were adopted resulted in the neglect of data modeling and proper data architecture, resulting in inconsistencies, data quality issues, and difficulties in data integration.\n\nLack of standardization: While cloud environments freed teams to use various tools and platforms, the consistency of data management practices degraded, making it harder to ensure consistency and interoperability across an organization.\n\nScalability and performance issues: Without proper data modeling, it became difficult to optimize systems for performance and scalability. Bottlenecks and reduced system efficiency resulted as data volumes grew.\n\nSecurity and compliance risks: Rapid cloud adoption without adequate attention to data modeling and architecture can expose organizations to security vulnerabilities and compliance risks, especially when dealing with sensitive or regulated data.\n\nDifficulties in extracting value from data: Without a well-thought-out data model, organizations struggle to extract meaningful insights from data. Inevitably, these organizations found that simply having data in the cloud did not guarantee it was inherently usable or valuable for decision-making.\n\n2. Data modeling defined\n\nData modeling is the practice or process of creating a conceptual representation of data objects and the relation between them. Data modeling is comparable to architecture, in that the process blueprints how data is stored, managed, and used within and between systems and databases.\n\nIn essence, there are three key components of data modeling:\n\nEntities: Entities represent the real-world objects or concepts an organization wants to understand better. Examples of data modeling entities include products, employees, and customers.\n\nAttributes: These are the characteristics or properties of the entities being modeled. Attributes provide details that are used to describe and distinguish instances of an entity—product names, prices, customer names, phone numbers, etc.\n\nRelationships: The connections between entities in a data model are called relationships. They can be one-to-one, many-to-many, or one-to-many. Each entity is represented in a relational database in the typical data modeling process. While each entity has a unique identity, it can have multiple instances.\n\nTraditionally, the role of data modeling primarily focused on designing databases for transactional systems and normalizing data to reduce redundancy, improving database performance. The process itself mainly involved working with structured data in relational databases.\n\nModern data modeling is highly varied by comparison. And while its practice and process have evolved beyond some of its inherent qualities viewed negatively in the past, others are now increasingly accepted as trade-offs to be balanced against.\n\nData modeling today caters to a wide range of data storage and processing systems, ranging from traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS) to data lakes and NoSQL databases. Data models now facilitate data integration. They can support advanced analytics, data science initiatives, and predictive modeling. Modern models emphasize agility and scalability to quickly adapt to shifting business requirements.\n\nAs such, data modeling now also supports efforts in the data space to democratize data, helping to make data more understandable and accessible to a wide range of users.\n\n3. Common types of data models\n\nThere are four main types of data models, conceptual, logical, physical, and dimensional. This is true when the goal is to simplify the categorization of data models.\n\nDepending on the business needs of an organization, however, more than these initial four may be considered and utilized. We note the former simply because of the confusion this can sometimes cause within the data space.\n\nConceptual data models\n\nThe purpose of conceptual data models is to establish a macro, business-focused view of an organization’s data structure. Conceptual models are often leveraged in the planning phase of database design or a database management system.\n\nIn these cases, a data architect or modeler may work with business stakeholders and analysts to identify relevant entities, attributes, and relationships using unified modeling language (UML) and entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs).\n\nLogical data modeling\n\nLogical data models work to provide a detailed view of organizational data that is independent of specific technologies and physical considerations. By doing so, logical models are free to focus on capturing business requirements and rules without being biased by technical constraints. As a result, they can provide a clearer understanding of data from a business perspective.\n\nThe ability of less technical stakeholders to more easily understand logical data models also makes them a particularly useful tool for communicating with technical teams.\n\nPhysical data modeling\n\nAlternately, physical data modeling aims to capture and represent the detailed structure and design of a database, taking into account the specific features and constraints of a chosen database management system (DBMS), as well as business requirements for performance, access methods, and storage.\n\nFor this reason, the entities database administrators and developers will focus on include physical aspects of a database—indexes, keys, partitioning, stored procedures and triggers, etc.\n\nDimensional data modeling\n\nFor business intelligence and data warehousing applications, dimensional data modeling is often used. This is because a dimensional model employs an efficient, user-friendly, flexible structure that organizes data into fact tables and dimensions to support fast querying and reporting.\n\nDue to this, dimensional data models can specifically support related applications' complex queries, analysis, and reporting needs.\n\nObject-oriented data modeling\n\nBased on the principles of object-oriented programming, object-oriented data modeling represents data as objects instead of entities. The objects in this type of data modeling encapsulate both data and behavior. This object-oriented approach is key, making object-oriented models highly useful in scenarios where data structures must reflect real-world objects and their relationships.\n\nCommon examples of these scenarios include ecommerce and inventory management systems, banking and financial systems, customer relationship management (CMS) systems, and educational software.\n\nData vault modeling\n\nAs the word “vault” implies, data vault modeling is used in data warehousing, but also in business intelligence. Both data warehousing and BI projects benefit from the historical data preservation, scalability, flexibility, and integration capabilities that data vault models provide.\n\nIn theory, this makes data modeling a potential tool for any organization that needs to integrate data from multiple sources while maintaining data history and lineage (e.g., healthcare organizations, government agencies, and manufacturing companies).\n\nNormalized data modeling\n\nThis type of data modeling focuses on two things—reducing data redundancy and improving data integrity. This can be crucial for transactional systems where data integrity and consistency are of prime importance. Normalized models are easier to maintain and update, while they also prevent data anomalies like inconsistencies and duplication.\n\nDe-normalized data modeling\n\nAlternately, de-normalized data models involve the intentional introduction of redundancies into a dataset in order to improve performance. Through de-normalized modeling, related data can be stored in the same table or document. This reduces the need for computationally expensive join operations, which can slow down query performance.\n\nBecause of how they function, de-normalized data models also harmonize with the principles of NoSQL databases, which prioritize flexibility, scalability, and performance.\n\n4. Causes of controversy in the data modeling space\n\nData scholars agree that discussions around data modeling function similarly to a hornet’s nest in nature—both tend to cause massive amounts of pain when stumbled into. While unfortunate for the stumbler, it helps to understand that, in both cases, damage results in the attempt to defend what one holds dear.\n\nFor hornets, driven to protect the nest’s existing and developing queens, the aggression results from a combination of their innate programming, alarm pheromones, and the instinct to attack in numbers in order to intimidate and dissuade larger foes.\n\nFor data practitioners, however, aggressively defending one’s beliefs about the process and practice of data modeling is usually motivated by one or more of the following factors:\n\nDiverse perspectives: Data modeling is a field that intersects with numerous disciplines, including data science, software engineering, database design, data analytics, and business intelligence. While sharing varying degrees of overlap, these disparate professional backgrounds act as frames through which the views of “effective data modeling” become wildly divergent in the data space.\n\nComplexity and trade-offs: Additionally, data modeling tends to involve near-endless tradeoffs between competing priorities. These tradeoffs include speed vs. governance, normalization vs. performance, and structure vs. flexibility—each with passionate advocates on both sides of the aisle.\n\nOrganizational context: The “right” data model in one organization may not be the same in another, even when operating within the same industry. Differing business rules and goals, data requirements, schema, information systems, and data maturity all but guarantee that there will never be one true data modeling technique or process.\n\nSubjectivity in design: Data modeling itself can be quite subjective. Like many design disciplines, there are often multiple ways to model a given dataset. And data modelers themselves often have legitimate reasons for championing one approach over another. This subjectivity is part of why many find the challenges of data modeling so fulfilling.\n\nEvolving technologies: Despite the order and logic practitioners attempt to bring to the table, the exponentially rapid evolution of data technologies—from traditional relational databases to NoSQL, low and no-code platforms, and big data—necessitates approaches to data modeling to continuously diversify.\n\nFluctuating best practices: Due to the ever-evolving modeling landscape, its related best practices invariably need to change. Techniques once considered sacrosanct can find themselves outdated, furthering debates about what the current best approach may be at any given time.\n\nEmotional Investment: Data practitioners tend to be curious, persistent, analytical thinkers who benefit from a high attention to detail. As such, those who practice data modeling (or cross paths with it) tend to invest a great deal of intellectual and emotional capital in their work. Occasionally, this can create an environment where critiques or suggestions for alternate approaches can either be delivered as a personal attack, or taken as such.\n\n5. Restoring the model of balance\n\nThe good news is that navigating the tension between the impact of data modeling and the convenience of the modern data stack is inevitable. Organizations helping to strike the balance should consider employing the following:\n\nAdopt a hybrid approach: Consider using structured data modeling for core business entities that require consistency and stability above all. In areas that call for more agility and flexibility, employ modern data technologies that enable rapid iteration.\n\nHarmonize flexibility with standardization: Building on a hybrid approach, look to standardize core data elements and processes. At the same time, allow for flexibility in areas where rapid change can be expected. Embrace constant balancing and rebalancing of the strengths of structured data modeling and the modern data stack.\n\nUse iterative data modeling: Instead of insisting on extensive upfront data modeling, try an iterative approach. Start with a basic model, then evolve it as needed. Iteration can produce the best of both worlds, maintaining a structured approach while responding to requirements as they change over time.\n\nLeverage data virtualization: Data visualization provides a helpful layer of abstraction that allows for integrating diverse data sources without extensive modeling. In some organizations, this approach maintains agility while ensuring data is effectively understood and used.\n\nFocus on metadata management: Bridging the gap between structure modeling and agility usually involves a (sometimes renewed) focus on effective metadata management. Robust metadata curation further enables organizational flexibility while clarity regarding data structures and relationships is maintained.\n\nEmphasize data governance: When individuals are empowered to enact consistent data governance, clear policies and standards guiding data quality, usage, and security help ensure a data environment remains as agile as possible.\n\nEnable self-service data access: When implemented with appropriate controls, self-service data access supports agility by allowing users to access data as needed while still operating within the framework of the established data model.\n\nContinuous collaboration: Make sure to foster continuous collaboration between your data architects, engineers, and business users. While the passionate data modeling discussions will still take place from time to time, making cross-disciplinary collaboration an important part of the culture helps keep modeling efforts and business needs aligned.\n\nImplement data contracts: Finally, employ data contracts to provide structured agreements on data formats and interfaces. Their ability to foster communication between data producers and consumers promotes balance just as the other tactics here do—but also allows that balance to scale.\n\n6. Suggested next steps\n\nAs is now abundantly clear, treating data as a product is paramount for any organization looking to succeed in an overwhelmingly data-dependent world. Data contracts are the best way to guarantee the quality of data before it even enters an organization."

Reddit is\nalso going to sell your information, you data, your content to third party AI\ncompanies so that they can train their models on your work, your life, your\ncontent and Reddit can make money from it, all while you see nothing in return.\n\n## Lack of respect for its third party developers\n\nI'm sure everyone at this point is familiar with the API changes putting many  \nthird party application developers out of business. Reddit saw how much money  \nentities like OpenAI and other data scraping firms are making and wants a slice  \nof that pie, and doesn't care who it tramples on in the process. Third party  \ndevelopers have created tools that make the use of Reddit far more appealing and  \nfeasible for so many people, again freely creating value for the company, and  \nit doesn't care that it's killing off these initiatives in order to take some of  \nthe profits it thinks it's entitled to.\n\n## Lack of respect for other cultures\n\nReddit spreads and enforces right wing, libertarian, US values, morals, and  \nethics, forcing other cultures to abandon their own values and adopt American  \nones if they wish to provide free labour and content to a for profit American  \ncorporation. American cultural hegemony is ever present and only made worse by  \ncompanies like Reddit actively forcing their values and social mores upon  \nforeign cultures without any sensitivity or care for local values and customs.  \nMeanwhile they allow reprehensible ideologies to spread through their network  \nunchecked because, while other nations might make such hate and bigotry illegal,  \nReddit holds \"Free Speech\" in the highest regard, but only so long as it doesn't  \noffend their own American sensibilities.\n\n## Lack for respect for the truth\n\nReddit has long been associated with disinformation, conspiracy theories,  \nastroturfing, and many such targeted attacks against the truth. Again protected  \nunder a veil of \"Free Speech\", these harmful lies spread far and wide using  \nReddit as a base. Reddit allows whole deranged communities and power-mad  \nmoderators to enforce their own twisted world-views, allowing them to silence  \ndissenting voices who oppose the radical, and often bigoted, vitriol spewed by  \nthose who fear leaving their own bubbles of conformity and isolation.\n\n## Lack of respect for common decency\n\nReddit is full of hate and bigotry. Many subreddits contain casual exclusion,  \ndiscrimination, insults, homophobia, transphobia, racism, anti-semitism,  \ncolonialism, imperialism, American exceptionalism, and just general edgy hatred.  \nReddit is toxic, it creates, incentivises, and profits off of \"engagement\" and  \n\"high arousal emotions\" which is a polite way of saying \"shouting matches\" and  \n\"fear and hatred\".\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf not for ideological reasons then at least leave Reddit for personal ones. Do  \nYou enjoy endlessly scrolling Reddit? Does constantly refreshing your feed bring  \nyou any joy or pleasure? Does getting into meaningless internet arguments with  \nstrangers on the internet improve your life? Quit Reddit, if only for a few  \nweeks, and see if it improves your life.\n\nI am leaving Reddit for good. I urge you to do so as well.\n\n### Comment ID e98lq6b with +17 score by [(coebruh, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e98lq6b/) (in reply to ID e98kx3o):\nOh, you know we do!\n\n## Comment ID e9816yd with +38 score by [(DeadKittyPool, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e9816yd/) (in reply to ID 9uulai):\nFrankly, I've never felt voting to be all that essential to the process.\n\n### Comment ID e983dk9 with +32 score by [(giaaeron, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e983dk9/) (in reply to ID e9816yd):\nNo kidding, Ford.\n\n#### Comment ID e98rftb with +4 score by [(sumppumpslump, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e98rftb/) (in reply to ID e983dk9):\nHi my name's Gerry and I like movies\n\n## Comment ID e98hwmc with +10 score by [(CannibalRed, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e98hwmc/) (in reply to ID 9uulai):\nIs everyone enjoying their FREE BEER!\n\n## Comment ID e98s9kl with +5 score by [(GolemThe3rd, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e98s9kl/) (in reply to ID 9uulai):\nAccourding to Moores law a computer in the year 3000 should be 2^684.66 times faster than one in 1973 (yes I know this is impossible, but its interesting)\n\n### Comment ID e98zr0z with +5 score by [(UnfetteredThoughts, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e98zr0z/) (in reply to ID e98s9kl):\nShame Moore's Law is breaking down already.\n\n## Comment ID e98tkan with +5 score by [(CheckersSpeech, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e98tkan/) (in reply to ID 9uulai):\nAt any rate, I *certainly* wouldn't harm the child.   \n\n*[Truthoscope goes nuts]*\n\n## Comment ID e98tmub with +5 score by [(CheckersSpeech, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e98tmub/) (in reply to ID 9uulai):\nPuny Human #1, Puny Human #2 ... and Morbo's good friend Richard Nixon!\n\n## Comment ID e98tek8 with +4 score by [(CheckersSpeech, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e98tek8/) (in reply to ID 9uulai):\nNixon's back!

      "# Post ID zorgoj: I asked an AI language model to create a narrative appraisal report. How did it do? with +5 score by [(Variaxist, Reddit, 2022-12-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/appraisal/comments/zorgoj/i_asked_an_ai_language_model_to_create_a/)\nwhat specific other details would you include/not include? I've only ever written form reports. It really seems to have hit all the high notes to me.\n\n>The subject property is located at 123 Main Street in Anytown, USA. It is a single-family, ranch-style home with three bedrooms and two bathrooms. The home was built in 1960 and has a gross living area of 1,500 square feet. The property sits on a lot of 0.25 acres and has a two-car attached garage.  \n>  \n>The exterior of the home is in good condition, with vinyl siding and a newer roof. The roof was replaced in 2018 with a dimensional shingle that has a 50-year lifespan. The landscaping is well-maintained, with mature trees and shrubs. The driveway is in good condition and is made of concrete. It leads to the attached garage, which has automatic doors and is large enough to fit two vehicles.  \n>  \n>The interior of the home is also in good condition, with recently updated finishes and appliances. The living room is spacious and features a fireplace and large windows. The fireplace is made of brick and has a wood-burning insert. The windows are double-paned and have been updated within the last 5 years. The kitchen is modern and includes granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, and a breakfast bar. The appliances are all Energy Star rated, which can help to lower utility costs. The three bedrooms are all of good size and have ample closet space. The master bedroom has a walk-in closet and a private bathroom. The two bathrooms have been recently renovated with new fixtures and finishes. The master bathroom has a double vanity and a walk-in shower, while the guest bathroom has a tub/shower combination.  \n>  \n>Overall, the subject property presents as a well-maintained and updated home in a desirable location. The home has a functional layout and has been updated with modern finishes and appliances. It is located in a quiet neighborhood with easy access to local amenities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>In the second part of this narrative appraisal report, we will provide a thorough analysis of the subject property's market value. The subject property is a single-family residential home located at 123 Main Street in Anytown, USA. It is situated on a 0.25 acre lot and features a 1,800 square foot floor plan with three bedrooms and two bathrooms.  \n>  \n>Upon arriving at the property, we observed that it is a well-maintained, ranch-style home with a brick exterior and a gable roof. The property also has a two-car attached garage and a fenced-in backyard.  \n>  \n>During our interior inspection of the property, we found that it has been recently renovated and features updated finishes throughout. The kitchen has new granite countertops and stainless steel appliances, and the bathrooms have been upgraded with new fixtures and tile work. The home also has new flooring and paint throughout.  \n>  \n>Additionally, the property has several amenities that contribute to its market value. These include a fireplace in the living room, a sunroom off the back of the house, and a finished basement with a recreation room and a den.  \n>  \n>Based on our analysis of the subject property, we believe that it is a well-maintained, updated home that is in good condition. The property's location and amenities also contribute to its market value. We will now proceed to compare the subject property to similar properties in the area to determine its fair market value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The third part of this detailed narrative appraisal report focuses on the analysis and conclusion of value for the subject property.  \n>  \n>After careful review and analysis of the subject property and the selected comparable sales, it is the opinion of the appraiser that the most likely sale price for the subject property as of the effective date of the appraisal would be $375,000. This value was determined through the use of the sales comparison approach, which involves comparing the features and characteristics of the subject property to those of similar properties that have recently sold in the area. The resulting value was then adjusted for any differences between the subject property and the comparables, as well as for any market conditions that may have affected value.  \n>  \n>It is important to note that this value represents the most likely sale price of the property if it were to be sold on the open market in an arm's length transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller. It is not a determination of the property's value for any other purpose, such as financing or taxation.  \n>  \n>In conclusion, the subject property is a well-maintained, single-family residence located in a desirable neighborhood with easy access to amenities and transportation. Based on the analysis and comparison to similar properties, it is the opinion of the appraiser that the most likely sale price for the subject property as of the effective date of the appraisal is $375,000.\n\n## Comment ID j0ona63 with +16 score by [(NorCalRushfan, Reddit, 2022-12-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/appraisal/comments/zorgoj/i_asked_an_ai_language_model_to_create_a/j0ona63/) (in reply to ID zorgoj):\nZoning, highest and best use, neighborhood market description and analysis, reconciliation of the three methods of valuation, subject market segment description and analysis all seem to be missing.\n\nThat said, the writing is much better than I typically see in appraisals too.\n\n## Comment ID j0oncux with +14 score by [(NorCalRushfan, Reddit, 2022-12-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/appraisal/comments/zorgoj/i_asked_an_ai_language_model_to_create_a/j0oncux/) (in reply to ID zorgoj):\n\"Desirable\" is a no no word.

Anything bigger than 7x7 is gonna be really hard to decorate, unless it's divided somehow or in a unique shape.\n\nAlso, have a rough plan of what rooms you want in your house before you actually make it. It makes actually building the house a lot easier, and prevents you from running into creative blocks (most of the time).\n\nDon't use bright white for lights. If you're making a normal house, use a color like burlap or linen instead. If you're making a public building or some other kind of facility, use an off white instead. Using a bright white light for every light makes your build look like a star exploding, so please save your time (that you would spend recoloring the lights) and just color them an off white.\n\n### Comment ID k9wzijn with +12 score by [(Tarasbys, Reddit, 2023-11-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bloxburg/comments/17z23ly/whats_one_building_mistake_people_should/k9wzijn/) (in reply to ID k9wxc7x):\nStrong on the 1st one.

I was \"hired\" but at a 100% of subscription click through. When I got all my episodes up, I found on their site a \"contract\" that had truly terrible terms. The contract claimed that nobody had to sign it for the contract to be binding. Well I immediately took all my episodes down. I wrote a fair contract (there are good models on the web) and asked them to sign it for us to proceed. I did another search on them and read they had received a grant to open their business in the American market. Then I found another of their contracts, modified from the one I  found linked through my dashboard on their site. They wrote back to  say that none of their writers was working with a contract. My terms would be the 100% while all the other writers would be at 50% (which I found red-flaggy) I figured that I could give it a try and if they didn't pay me it had been a gable anyway. Next, they sent me instructions on \"Next Steps\" which included choosing the actors, writing a logline, saying what I would do to advertise my story. The last \"Next Step\" is to open up a business page on LinkedIn: \" To further promote the shows, we would suggest building a LinkedIn page dedicated to showcasing your shows. You will be using this page for posting job listings to hire content creators and influencers. This approach will help in building your own brand and expanding the reach of your shows to a broader audience.\" etc. So, I have written them questions about that which sounds red-flaggy to me.\n\nI keep thinking that the page that says they got a big grant to expand and how they have millions of users could be written by anybody and not necessarily true at all.\n\n### Comment ID k5n2k3l with +1 score by [(AutoModerator, Reddit, 2023-10-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/16rxjvc/anybody_ever_hear_of_headfone/k5n2k3l/) (in reply to ID k5n2k1p):\nYour comment was filtered for manual review because it is extremely long (1000+ characters).

Not engagement, but *subscription*. Included in that 'salary', you partake in the marketing for your own show. I'm weary of anything that pays per subscription model and not hourly--writing takes a lot of time and can be mentally draining after a long day. \n\nThe website looks pretty cool; but there is no concise way of showing how many subscriptions there are to a show, which I think is a little weird. You'd think that every show would have a listed number of subs, even just to lure in new readers. There are likes and comments, but is it worth working there if no one actually subscribes? \n\nEverything I see online ([Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Headfone-Reviews-E4873807.htm) and [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Headfone/reviews)) features reviews that mention terrible pay, and \"scammy vibes\". That the production teams and company staff are nice enough, but wages are unfair. I'm a little disheartened because I'm moving to an area where I need to be paid efficiently. \n\nImo, it seems like a nice startup that hasn't figured out the best business model just yet.

They said oh awesome we want to hire you, guve us your phone number for whats app and the \"creative team\" will communicate, if you don't have whats app make one etc. So this is where I didn't want to give them my number, I made a google voice number and made a whatsapp business account and gave it to them. After that I haven't heard form them. Its been maybe 2-3 weeks, and I still haven't heard from them, no e-mails, no contact through whats app, when before it took maybe 2-3 days before for them to get back to me.

They have a facebook page and bots respond, also I saw another ad on Linkedin for the same job with a different companys name but similar they used the name craft.

I also looked on linkedin and they have a few people who said they are scams, they have people create these jobs under diffrent companies and basically put people through this process and they don't get paid much if anything at all.

Spoilers.\n\nIrving founded Odessa with Vinsfeld to create an easily understood threat to unite Filgaia against the REAL threat which was the encroaching parallel universe that previously consumed the dragons' universe from which Lombardia escaped.\n\nKanon and the Valerias are distant relatives who are all descended from the Sword Magess and feel burdoned with purpose because of it.\n\nIrving wants to save the world and Kanon wants to kill Lord Blazer (who inhabits Ashley, ostensibly as planned by Irving to give extra power in the fight against the encroaching universe).\n\nThey tried locking the universe into the Trapezohedron to give it a corporeal form to make it mortal. That didn't work so Irving put it in Altecia (maybe as an innuendo too? The localization leaves them incestually ambiguous) at the heart of the world, where it would naturally be attracted due to all the life force gathered there.\n\nThe gang kicks its ass with Ashley's Lord Blazer powers, and then through the power of friendship they kick Blazer's ass as well.\n\n### Comment ID gtjcob2 with +6 score by [(reyinpoetic, Reddit, 2021-04-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildarms/comments/mkvhpi/finally_finished_wild_arms_2_but_i_have_some/gtjcob2/) (in reply to ID gtimp86):\nYeah, the incest isn't so much implied as stated outright.  Irving wanted the child who became the vessel for the Kuiper Belt to be double-extra descended from the Sword Magess, thus the incest.\n\nAnd, while no less abstract, it wasn't the Power of Friendship™ that defeated Lord Blazer, but the combined societal inspiration across Filgaia, focused on Ashley.  In the past, Anastasia had to stand alone and died because nobody believed than anyone but her could fight Lord Blazer.

Her only friend was Marivel, the last of the vampiric Crimson Nobles.  Anastasia fought alone, however, and died for the sake of everyone in the world, sealing Lord Blazer away into the far future.\n\nOver time, Anastasia's descendants would become known as those with **Hero**ic blood.  Some would become nobles through this reputation, such as Irving Vold Valeria.  Others would cling to that **Hero**ic reputation, even as they dredged through the gutters, such as Aisha Bernadette.\n\nIrving was well connected, and skilled in academics, magic, and despite his crippled legs, combat.  It was at the Sielije observatory that Irving first noticed an inconsistency in the sky.  A stain starting to form.  Another universe beginning to devour Filgaia.  However, he knew that bringing this situation to the attention of the nations of the world would only worsen the divides that existed between them, and make Filgaia weaker than ever against this new threat.  Irving knew that he had to create a tangible threat for Filgaia to unite against.  Or a threat that could bring all of Filgaia to heel.\n\nFive years ago, the Slayheim Liberation Army fight a coup d'etat against the Slayheim royal family, under the leadership of Vinsfeld Rhadamanthus, and fronted by the **Hero** of Slayheim, Brad Evans.  They won, but the royal family weren't willing to lose.  They detonated the Angel Halo, a superweapon that rendered the entirety of Slayheim a barren salt waste, with only undead husks remaining of their people.  Brad Evans was captured far south of Slayheim.  Vinsfeld went missing.\n\nDuring the five years Brad wasted away in Illsveil Prison, Irving contacted Vinsfeld, offering him considerable funding to lead a terror organization, Odessa.\n\nAt the same time, the kingdom of Meria Boule was forming ARMS, the Agile Remote Mission Squad, a platoon of musketeers who would mobilize against the increasing monster threat in Merian territories.  However, Odessa chose to, or rather was instructed to strike at ARMS's formation ceremony.\n\nCaina, one of Vinsfeld's lieutenants, was a specialist at summoning magic, and opened a demon gate in the Sword Cathedral, a shrine to the Sword Magess, and where all the ARMS Musketeers were.  All the Musketeers are possessed by Protoblazer demons, and died.\n\nAll but one.  Ashley Winchester, a Musketeer unremarkable except for his reckless **hero**ic steak, was possessed by Lord Blazer itself, let back into the world by Caina's Demon Summoning.  It was only through the calling of Anastasia's sword, the Argetlahm, that Ashley was able to suppress Lord Blazer with the power of Blazer's old enemy.\n\nLater, after sleeping off the injuries he'd sustained, Ashley found a young girl outside the bakery he lives in.  The young girl was Lilka Eleniak, younger sister to the famed Eleniak Witch-girl, whom Lilka looked up to as her **Hero**.  However, due to a research accident, the elder Eleniak was, for lack of a better term, gone.  Lilka had recieved a letter summoning the Eleniak Witch-girl to the home of Irving Vold Valeria, and had traveled from her home in Sielije to Meria Boule in her sister's stead.\n\nIrving had left a similar summons with Marina, Ashley's childhood friend and romantic interest, and so it was in both his and Lilka's interest that they travel together to the Valeria Chateau.\n\nOnce there, Irving informed the two that he intended to reform ARMS as a smaller force, to be mobilized anywhere in the world, against any threats.  This would soon ring hollow, however, as Irving would use Ashley's weapon to frame him for attempted murder, and have Ashley sent to Illsveil Prison, with Lilka escorting him.\n\nAshley was not in prison long before a mass escape occurred, caused by Judecca, another of Vinsfeld's lieutenants, as a rapid recruitment drive for Odessa's footsoldiers.  This allowed Ashley to escape and for her and Lilka to encounter the only prisoner who did not take the opportunity to run: Brad Evans.  Brad would join them, and was puzzled upon finding out that his release was arranged by Irving, who had selected Brad for membership in ARMS before framing Ashley.\n\nDuring one of their first assignments, the newly-formed ARMS would uncover a global communications hijacking by Odessa, where they declared their intentions: to forcibly unite all of Filgaia under their banner, as the \"**Hero**es\" against the corruption of the world governments.\n\nARMS and Odessa would continue to fight each other, with the threat of Odessa being the catalyst for other world nations giving ARMS jurisdiction within their borders.  Along the way, ARMS would gain as members Tim Rhymeless, a young shaman of the Baskar Tribe, and Kanon, otherwise known as Aisha Bernadette, who had replaced most of her body with cybernetics to pursue her **hero**ic lineage as a bounty hunter, and who pursued the spirit of Lord Blazer within Ashley.  Additionally, a mysterious engineer named Marivel would attach herself to ARMS, claiming to know Ashley.\n\nAdditionally, that same spirit had manifested within Ashley as the formidable KnightBlazer, a ghoulish demonic warrior of charred blood and torn flesh, whose every action took all of Ashley's willpower to reign in.\n\nAdditionally, the remaining of Vinsfeld's lieutenants were encountered.  Ptolomea, who was honorable and a **hero** to his men, and Antenora, who sought revenge against Vinsfeld for killing her family, by making Vinsfeld fall in love with her.  (It is possible that Antenora was the daughter of Slayheim nobles, or possibly the princess of Slayheim, but it's not confirmed in either language.)\n\nTim is tasked with contacting the Guardians, the spirit-gods of Filgaia, for aid against Odessa, but in order to do so, he is supposed to be sacrificed, giving his life to become a **hero**.  He rejects this, however, and chooses to become a living link to the Guardians.\n\nAfter many encounters, Odessa has commandeered the ancient sky fortress Heimdall Gazzo, and is threatening the now-united nations of Filgaia with its munitions.  ARMS disables the Gazzo's surface-based support towers, the Diablo Pillars, killing Ptolomea, driving Judecca to suicide, forcing Caina to default on a bargain with a spirit and being taken to another dimension, and killing Antenora, which fulfilled her vengeance plot against Vinsfeld.\n\nARMS stormed the Gazzo and slew Vinsfeld, ending the threat of Odessa.  However, much like his foes at Slayheim, Vinsfeld couldn't stand to lose, and tried to strand ARMS in space.  All of ARMS got to the escape pods, except for Ashley, who was lost in low-orbit, protected only by the spirit of Anastasia, the Sword Magess.\n\n### Comment ID gtjnbqm with +8 score by [(reyinpoetic, Reddit, 2021-04-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildarms/comments/mkvhpi/finally_finished_wild_arms_2_but_i_have_some/gtjnbqm/) (in reply to ID gtjnbdp):\nAshley awoke in the Maze of Memory, a crystallized nexus of Anastasia's lifetime, where Marivel first met Ashley.  Exploring this Maze, Ashley learned that the great **Hero**, the Sword Magess, was just a scared girl, who cared too much not to fight for the future if the world.  Anastasia never wanted to be a **hero**.  She never saw herself as a **hero**.  She wanted to live her normal, happy life, but instead she died a **hero**.\n\nLearning this of the vaunted Sword Magess resonates with Ashley, who until now had been on the same track of self-sacrifice as Anastasia, but found himself increasingly wishing for a normal life.\n\nAt the end of the Memory Maze, and the end of Anastasia's life, Anastasia gave Ashley sisterly advice, and sent Lucied, the Guardian of Desire and her constant companion, to help Ashley.\n\nAshley willed himself to return to Filgaia, and emerged in the Sword Cathedral, the place where he and Anastasia's spirit had first met.\n\nARMS was reunited, and just in time, as Odessa's remains had to be dealt with, and the Encroaching Parallel Universe Irving had seen long ago was now an obvious threat.  It had been responsible for the increase in monster numbers that had been plaguing Filgaia, and now it has blotted out the sky.\n\nA recent encounter with the Draconic Nuclear Weapon, Grauswein, had educated ARMS about the immense power that the bio-mechanical Dragons could offer, and seeking one out was the obvious course of action to combat the other universe attacking their own.  They beseeched Lombardia for aid, but the dragon we resigned to death, for she had seen this happen before, to her own home universe.  The Encroaching Parallel Universe, Kuiper Belt, had devoured her home, and the dragons had fled to Filgaia, hoping to escape, but inadvertently led Kuiper Belt to Filgaia.  All but Lombardia had died off, their mechanical bodies harvested for Filgaian technology.\n\nARMS were able to convince Lombardia to fight, however, and she lent her wings to ARMS.\n\nARMS were now faced with the cruel realty of their situation.  The thing they were fighting was not a man or a creature.  It was not even a location, but an entire universe.  They could not even hope to exist in the way they would need to to interact with the Kuiper Belt.  But Irving had an idea.  An idea that would require power.  A world's power.\n\nThe four Raypoints, Earth, Wing, Flame, and Muse were challenging, both to ARMS as a whole, and to it's members.  Brad confronted truths about his past as firm as the earth.  Tim confronted the choice he had made, as free as the wind.  Lilka overcame her inferiority complex, allowing herself to burn bright as a flame.  And Kanon reconciled with her past self, letting Aisha pour back into Kanon like water.\n\nWith the Raypoints freed, Filgaia's own mana flowed free, and Irving's plan could be put to action.  Just as Lord Blazer was a living apocalypse contained within Ashley's living body, so too, Irving believed, could the Kuiper Belt be contained within a mortal shell.  ARMS would traverse the exterior of the great mana prison, the Trapezohedron, and slew a larva that had manifested on it.\n\nHowever, that was but the smallest fragment of the Kuiper Belt.  The plan was a failure.  Their only option for now was to rest, and deal with the last known leftovers of Odessa: the wreckage of the Heimdall Gazzo.\n\nIt was at the Gazzo, in a surging data fragment, that ARMS found out the horrible truth.  Irving had orchestrated everything, from the formation of the original doomed ARMS squad and Odessa's formation, through the diplomatic appliances of desperation.  Whether Odessa won or lost, it meant a united Filgaia against the Kuiper Belt.\n\nIt was as ARMS learned these truths that Irving put his final, desperate plan into action.  He impregnated his twin sister Altaecia, and they both vanished from the Chateau, leaving only a note for ARMS to follow them to the Spiral Tower, the center of Filgaia, and access point to Glaive le Gable, Guardian of the primordial Mud.\n\nAshley and Marina consummated their love.\n\nLilka resolved to return to her classes.\n\nBrad spent time with a comatose friend of his from the Slayheim War: the true Brad Evans, whose name the ARMS member had taken to keep the **Hero**'s name going.  His true name, and the name that the wheelchair-bound veteran now held, was Billy Pidler.\n\nTim entered a relationship with a girl from his birthtown, Colette.\n\nKanon came to the realization that **hero**ism is performed, not inherited through blood.\n\nAnd Marivel, who may or may not have joined the ARMS squad, found companionship in her immortal life in an orphan boy.\n\nThen, they set out.\n\nAt the bottom of the Spiral Tower, in the depths of the massive Guardian of Mud, ARMS found Irving and Altaecia.  Irving apologized to ARMS, but held firm that he wanted to fight alongside them, as an equal, despite his crippled legs.  He desired nothing so much as to be a **hero**.  And so he and his sister created a new life, an empty shell, and brought it to the focus point of all life in Filgaia, for the Kuiper Belt to occupy, just as Lord Blazer occupied Ashley.  The Kuiper Belt entered the new life, and Irving and Altaecia were consumed by the creation of a Living Universe \n\nThe fight was desperate.  ARMS were spread thin, and could only hold on.  But the Encroaching Parallel Universe was slain, once and for all.  All was well.\n\nExcept that the demon inside Ashley had been biding it's time, waiting for the right time to emerge and consume the world in flames once more.  Ashley was tired, weakened from the fight against the Kuiper Belt.  Now was the time.\n\nBut Lord Blazer was not the only one prepared for this moment.  The Argetlahm, which had dwelled within Ashley ever since the Sword Cathedral, lent Ashley the resilience of Anastasia, and let him fight the demon.\n\nThere was one big difference between Anastasia and Ashley, however.  Anastasia was the **hero** when everyone needed one.  ARMS had inspired and united all of Filgaia to stand and fight for themselves, to desire a world that doesn't need a **hero**.  That desire empowered Ashley to destroy Lord Blazer utterly.\n\nA year later, a year into the new peace, all of ARMS meet again.  They discuss how it was not a **hero** who saved the world, but everybody.  Ashley and Marina introduce their children.  Twins, a boy and girl.  Lilka asks their names.  The names are never said, but Marina comments that they are the most wonderful names in Filgaia, and Ashley tells the others to protect them, even if they get lost on their way.\n\n\"We're never alone, right?  Right?  I'm not a \"hero\".  The protagonist of this endless tale is...\"\n\nThe End\n\n#### Comment ID gtkk5zu with +4 score by [(Purest_Prodigy, Reddit, 2021-04-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildarms/comments/mkvhpi/finally_finished_wild_arms_2_but_i_have_some/gtkk5zu/) (in reply to ID gtjnbqm):\nhero\n\n#### Comment ID ma396ul with +1 score by [(DStrifeA, Reddit, 2025-01-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildarms/comments/mkvhpi/finally_finished_wild_arms_2_but_i_have_some/ma396ul/) (in reply to ID gtjnbqm):\n\"...but the dragon we resigned to death, for she had seen this happen before, to her own home universe.\"\n\nHe was not created by Guild Galad?  \nGuild Galad Master:  Most of the real \"Dragons\" died and became fossils in ancient times.

Big-sis Anastasia teamed up with Marivel (the last vampire) to fight the demons, and managed to seal Lord Blazer with the power of the holy blade Argetlahm. Thanks to her efforts, the Valeria family became fairly recognised, with the \"Main\" branch of the family being led by Irving who has a sister, Altecia. There's also a sub-branch of the family that's not recognised, with Aisha Valeria (i.e. Kannon).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIrving realises that aliens are coming (enroaching universe-something), so he decides to unite the world to fight it. He funds both a terrorist organisation (Odessa) and an anti-terrorist organisation (ARMS) so that either (a) Odessa conquers and unites the world, or (b) the world unites behind ARMS to fight Odessa.\n\nAnyway, during the prize presentation ceremony after the 3 character introduction chapters, Odessa tries to summon demons, and summons lord blazer into Ashley's body. Ashley somehow fights/resists the influence and pulls out Argetlahm, which combats and balances the influence of Lord Blazer, leading to his Black Knight form (power of light and darkness).\n\nAlong the way, various things happen, e.g. Tim and how his tribe can control Guardians which guard the world by sacrificing someone to keep some sort of barrier up, Brad (who may or may not have switched identities with wheelchair dude, and is probably gay) who's a former freedom fighter who fought alongside Vinny joining ARMS. Kannon, believing she's from a line of demon hunters/slayers (due to the Valeria bloodline), etc. \n\nAshley and his happy friends defeat Vinsfield and his happy friends (also Anthorea is the best villian out there), and the world is united! just as Irving wanted. Ashley gets trapped in space and is rescued by the team, and comes back to find out the alien universe is eating Filgaia's skies. Irving comes up with a plan to shove the universe into a box and destroying the box (i.e. the trapezohedron). Plan doesn't work. So he makes a baby with his sister and shoves the universe into that baby as a medium instead, and you fight that in the.. spiral tower?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat be the main plot.\n\n## Comment ID gtjtr3w with +2 score by [(kinetikparameter, Reddit, 2021-04-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildarms/comments/mkvhpi/finally_finished_wild_arms_2_but_i_have_some/gtjtr3w/) (in reply to ID mkvhpi):\nActually, looking it up.... it was the Alcemic Plant.

Why would someone want to give me MORE money?”\n\nHaving more cash on hand (in competent hands where there’s a plan to put that money to use) actually derisks the investment. 50k in a company means there’s zero margin for error. If you don’t deliver or make a mistake, that 50k is gone. With 2-3M, you have longer runway to deliver, make mistakes, etc. You also have a budget for marketing and acquiring users, hiring a team, etc, all of which is important. Without that, and only investing 50k, you might have a product but you have no path to finding anyone to use/buy your product, and someone has bet on just one persons ability for deliver it all.\n\n## Comment ID l6y7q7a with +43 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l6y7q7a/) (in reply to ID 1d7bqx2):\n[removed]\n\n### Comment ID l6z6dos with +5 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l6z6dos/) (in reply to ID l6y7q7a):\ni had angels offer 10-20 each. but only after many months of work\n\n#### Comment ID l6zqy8i with +7 score by [(TriggernometryPhD, Reddit, 2024-06-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l6zqy8i/) (in reply to ID l6z6dos):\nThe juice is not worth the squeeze.\n\n## Comment ID l6z04ml with +9 score by [(DancinWithWolves, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l6z04ml/) (in reply to ID 1d7bqx2):\nDepending on your area, you should be able to find a local network of angel investors.

It comes with many, MANY strings attached. And it’s mostly a one-way door, you can’t (easily) undo it (context: speaking from personal experience - I raised $15M for my first startup, acquired in 2021).\n\nAside from the other possible funding sources that others have mentioned, if you do make the decision to raise from VCs, then asking for 50K is an order of magnitude (or two) off. Either raise a 500K SAFE, or go for a full priced round and ask for a few million.\n\nAgain, this all depends on what sort of traction you actually have.\n\n## Comment ID l6y9d7w with +1 score by [(there-you-run, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l6y9d7w/) (in reply to ID 1d7bqx2):\nFriends and Family.\n\n## Comment ID l6zd07n with +1 score by [(lets-make-deals, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l6zd07n/) (in reply to ID 1d7bqx2):\nAngel Investors $10k - $750k ...

Success of a VC fund is based on the \"power law\" where most companies in the portfolio will fail, but a couple will be a massive successes (e.g. the Facebooks) which will not only offset the other failed companies in the portfolio, but also return outsized gains for the investors of the fund (i.e. LPs). In other words, VCs need to make bets on companies where 1) the company has enough potential to be worth in the billions, and 2) the VC firm has enough invested where they won't be too diluted when (if) that exit event happens.\n\nFor perspective, the startup I joined as the first employee raised a $7M seed round. $50k checks would come from angel investors to fill out the round and bring on advisors.\n\nLike others said, potentially work with a bank or do a family and friends round.

It’s time I finally revisit this theory after a rewatch and reading all the great comments under my original post.\n\nOne thing before we start: this theory is *only* about the work being done in the basement of Lumon. There are so many other loose threads that will likely converge by the end of the series, but they are outside the scope of this post.\n\n*Hypothesis*\n\n**LUMON IS TRYING TO RESURRECT KIER EAGAN, EITHER IN MIND OR BODY.** If you are familiar with [Character.ai](http://Character.ai), you can think of this as creating a Kier chatbot, which may eventually be put into a host body.\n\n*How MDR works*\n\n* The source code for Kier’s consciousness can be found in his recordings and written words.\n   * It is possible he also “saved” data of himself in a primitive manner before he passed in 1939\n* Macrodata refinement exists to “rebuild” Kier\n   * Kier believed all people to be derived from the Four Tempers (“In my life, I have identified four components, which I call tempers, from which are derived every human soul \\[…\\] Each man's character is defined by the precise ratio that resides in him.”). Therefore his own data/consciousness would be comprised of the Four Tempers.\n   * Due to the limited technology of his lifetime, Kier’s data would not be clean. It’s in a “data soup”, mixed together with lots of noise.\n   * Refiners help sort Kier’s data back into the Four Tempers\n* Employees are severed so they do not inject their own personalities / selves into Eagan.\n   * Refiners must \"feel\" the emotion of the numbers\n   * Innies have no past experiences / emotions to contaminate the code\n   * One their first day as innies, they are tested ensure the procedure was complete and they can no longer recall their own past\n* Employees are surrounded by Kier artifacts, and nothing else, so the output is pure Kier Eagan. Since the innie is a blank canvas, Lumon can impress Kier onto their minds and channel his spirit into their refinement work\n   * The only words are Kier's (Compliance Handbook)\n   * The art offers visual depictions of his life\n   * The rewards are all simple things that Kier might have enjoyed as a child when he lived (1841-1939), such as erasers, finger traps, and caricatures.\n   * The party food (and glassware) are dated to the late 1800s / early 1900s (deviled eggs and melon balls).\n   * The Waffle Party is Dylan literally becoming Kier, in his home.\n   * The Breakroom punishment of verbal repetition, similar to writing lines on a chalkboard, is an antiquated form of corporeal punishment that Kier may have experienced as a child (Mark’s hand may have also been struck with a ruler, another outdated form of corporeal punishment)\n\n*Clues and evidence*\n\n* When data is sorted into a bin, a pop-up displays the four tempers: WO (woe), FC (frolic), DR (dread), and MA (malice)\n* The Macrodata Refiner’s Handbook (canonical material published online) confirms that refiners are sorting data into the tempers.\n   * “A refiner is someone who makes something pure, more usable, and more accessible. As a Lumon refiner, you’ll be removing impurities from data and reorganizing that data into its purest form. \\[…\\] Knowing the true meaning behind the numbers could inhibit your natural intuition”\n* Two things to know about artificial intelligence:\n   * It often uses “human-in-the-loop” learning, where models are trained with the help of real humans who teach the AI the correct answers. Refiners are essentially HITL.\n   * It uses “tokens”. When you ask ChatGPT “Explain daylight saving time”, the AI does not process this sentence by words. Instead, it is chunked up into numerical tokens, like \\[8143, 147, 9009, 27\\]. The MDR numbers are these tokens.\n* Jame Eagan used the phrase “And one day, you will sit with me at my revolving”. This is not a euphemism for dying. It is an Eaganism for transferring their consciousness from a mortal body to an immortal digital self. Whereas a severed employee drops down an elevator into their innie self, Eagan’s go through a revolving door into a digital self.\n* Many businesses are co-opted by their founders or executives for personal gain. While Lumon is a biotechnology conglomerate, the Eagan family is a cult-like faction within.\n   * Milchik emphasizes the Eagan’s over Lumon at Burt’s Party: “But only if you behave in a manner that brings no shame upon yourself, the founder or his progeny.”\n   * Cult attributes: pursuit of some afterlife or immortality, religious-style texts and paintings with Kier as a Jesus figure, referencing Kier as “The Grandfather”, use of gaslighting and corporeal punishment\n* The Eagan wing is called the **Perpetuity Wing**, which is a reference to the ultimate goal of the Eagan’s to live forever.\n\n*Related theories*\n\n* Other departments may be planning on a physical resurrection of Kier\n   * The goats may serve as biological tissue to clone Kier. Their caretaker’s distress definitely gives you the sense they were raised for the slaughter.\n   * Kier’s house in the Perpetuity Wing is not just part of a museum. It is for Kier to return to his home and a familiar environment.\n   * Optics and Design seem to be recreating items from Kier’s life, again to give him a familiar environment\n* Refiners may be more attuned to certain Tempers, and Lumon may have even kidnapped Gemma to get a better Woe candidate.\n   * Dylan, who has at least one kid (Milchik claims 3) and most enjoys the incentives, is Frolic\n   * Irving, who served in the military and obsessively paints dark pictures of the Testing Room elevator, is Dread\n   * Helena, who has a cutthroat outie, is Malice (hence why she was started on the “scary” numbers)\n   * Mark, who lost Gemma, is Woe.\n      * There is no reason to kidnap Gemma, a Russian literature professor, to act as the Wellness Director unless either A) Lumon saved Gemma’s life and kept her to test the limits of severance/resurrection on the Testing Floor, B) Lumon used Gemma’s death to attract Mark to MDR and/or C) Gemma did die, but her body is being used as a host for a test AI, which is why she cannot be released into the real world.\n      * Mark’s “freshman fluke” may have been the immediate aftereffects of his loss, and now that he is dating again / moving on he has become less productive\n      * Mark was also a former history professor of WWI, which may connect him more to Kier’s lifetime.\n   * NOTE: Refiners do not need to only focus on one temper, but having an area of expertise may help complete the files faster\n* The Board that speaks through Natalie may not be real people but instead the early stages of Kier’s AI, his motherBOARD. Jame Eagan is the CEO and can serve as a real-world intermediary when required.\n   * The “MIND” area marked on Petey’s map may be the server room hosting the motherBOARD\n* The MDR file names may be the places, people, things, and memories from Kier’s life\n\n*Final thoughts*\n\n* The ultimate goal is likely not just Kier, but the entire Eagan lineage. This might explain why some of the items in the basement may map onto other Eagan CEOs, like the office decor and the unseen incentives of paintball and coffee cozies\n   * Jame Eagan’s quote, “Come now, children of my industry, and know the children of my blood”\n* It is not clear why the refiners are given 5 bins, or how the numbers they drag to each bin are sorted into the correct temper. This does not challenge the theory, but is difficult to explain\n* Under my theory, the timing of the Dorner truck explosion in the Lexington Letters is just a coincidence (Lumon may still be responsible though)\n* There is a more practical theory: Lumon is simply trying to make a product that everyone in the world uses. Under this theory, the basement is simply stress-testing that product in different ways, hence the future expansion into additional departments. The Eagan family’s private aim may still be to piggyback off of this technology to create an army of followers (As Jame quoted young Helena: “They’ll all be Kier’s children”).\n\n\n\n## Comment ID m5k4fhc with +271 score by [(exqueezemenow, Reddit, 2025-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1hub00k/what_they_do_in_the_basement_at_lumon_and_why/m5k4fhc/) (in reply to ID 1hub00k):\nI think they're removing swear words from movies...\n\n### Comment ID m5ld3uy with +106 score by [(eeksie-peeksie, Reddit, 2025-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1hub00k/what_they_do_in_the_basement_at_lumon_and_why/m5ld3uy/) (in reply to ID m5k4fhc):\nThey’re helping people recover from the trauma of changing beds as children\n\n#### Comment ID m5nawjr with +51 score by [(orderofGreenZombies, Reddit, 2025-01-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1hub00k/what_they_do_in_the_basement_at_lumon_and_why/m5nawjr/) (in reply to ID m5ld3uy):\nPlease use a trigger warning before mentioning things that some of us experienced very viscerally in our past.\n\n### Comment ID m5k9yy9 with +61 score by [(Upbeat_County9191, Reddit, 2025-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1hub00k/what_they_do_in_the_basement_at_lumon_and_why/m5k9yy9/) (in reply to ID m5k4fhc):\nKilling eels\n\n#### Comment ID m5lt30g with +33 score by [(LockPleasant8026, Reddit, 2025-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1hub00k/what_they_do_in_the_basement_at_lumon_and_why/m5lt30g/) (in reply to ID m5k9yy9):\nWe can't co-habitate with that shit!\n\n### Comment ID m5l36xg with +24 score by [(Hungry-Baseball-4986, Reddit, 2025-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1hub00k/what_they_do_in_the_basement_at_lumon_and_why/m5l36xg/) (in reply to ID m5k4fhc):\nThey are quickly telling secrets to create a \" soul void\"\n\n### Comment ID m7tyysz with +1 score by [(mcmdreams0926, Reddit, 2025-01-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1hub00k/what_they_do_in_the_basement_at_lumon_and_why/m7tyysz/) (in reply to ID m5k4fhc):\n😹\n\n## Comment ID m5ke8j4 with +129 score by [(IceeDangles007, Reddit, 2025-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1hub00k/what_they_do_in_the_basement_at_lumon_and_why/m5ke8j4/) (in reply to ID 1hub00k):\nGood theory, fun read.

The work is mysterious to the workers, meaning that they have no satisfaction from the work since they're just a tiny cog in a massive machine.\n\nAt the same time, the work has actual value to the company, just not in a way that is relevant to the satisfaction or direct benefit of the workers.\n\nImagine, for instance, that your job were to install bolts in a sheet of metal over and over again all day. You don't know what the sheet of metal will be used for, but you have to put four bolts in each sheet all day long. Your work may be important for the final product, but you don't know what it is; you just have to keep doing your small part of it.

We know that they're doing MDR in multiple locations (per the Lexington Letter), so presumably they've missed a lot of quotas over the 10+ years they've been doing MDR.\n\nIt's hard to imagine that tissue is degrading in that way where they can say, \"This small portion of his brain matter will expire in one week\" over the period of 10+years either. I don't understand how that would work practically.\n\nAlso, the Lexington Letter heavily implies that the refinement has some immediate real-world impact, which doesn't really fit in with your theory.\n\nMy theory is that they're decrypting severance chip data for competing firms that also use severance so that they can remotely control employees of competing companies. We already know that Lumon can control severance remotely (per OTP) and that they have other protocols that have scary names, like Beehive Protocol. We also know that other companies use severance, not just Lumon.\n\n### Comment ID m5ljzhu with +10 score by [(sidneylopsides, Reddit, 2025-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1hub00k/what_they_do_in_the_basement_at_lumon_and_why/m5ljzhu/) (in reply to ID m5kv7ga):\nDegradation of the storage medium somehow?

Cold Harbor is Gemma / Ms Casey. My guess is that Ms Huang was one of the files they completely refined to meet quota in S1. \n\nWhy are there time limits? Because it’s a human specimen they’re operating on. Perhaps brain death occurs if it takes too long. That’s why Dylan tells Helly they usually only complete 1 in 5 test files.\n\nIn contrast to the above theory, I’m led to believe the work MDR does is in some way “murdering” real people. There are two big hints in S1:\n- Petey’s warning to Mark: “Okay. What if the cost of that help is that you’re murdering people eight hours a day and you don’t even know it?”\n- The Whole Mind Collective protesters’ first say “have a moment for children’s brain health?”. This hints at MDR’s work involving operating on kids’ brains\n  - And their poster suggests MDR is killing children/kids, literally by “hacking” on a computer: “ONE MAY SPEND ONE’S DAY HACKING CHILDREN TO BITS GO HOME TO ONE’S OWN KIDS NONE THE WISER”\n\nFurthermore, the MDR work is isolating emotionally-charged signals (number clusters that feel a certain way) and putting them in bins (aka recycling or trash bins). My hunch is that these signals are coming from the brains of real humans behind the computer screen that MDR can’t see, probably attached to wires in the testing floor.\n\nConnecting the dots, I think it’s more likely that MDR is refining the brains (specifically the “soul/mind”: the identity/personality/consciousness aspect) of real people who could be considered still alive - whether that’s a child (perhaps Ms Huang was Gemma’s baby that Lumon recovered with Gemma) or a partially damaged adult body (Gemma may have brain damage or something but is still viable). They are refining in that they are reorganizing or removing memories which are triggered/associated with emotional resonances (4 tempers). In the attempt to do this, MDR’s success rate is low: only 1 in 5 attempts makes it before they expire (Dylan’s words in e2 or close to it). So whether by allowing test files to expire (human dies) or by completing the file (human’s mind has been refined/purified - ie, their soul is gone, identity is gone because their salient memories of what makes them a person are neutralized), MDR is effectively murdering people (also MDR is short for MurDeR).\n\n## Comment ID m5mzz6q with +18 score by [(Elegant_Pea_4195, Reddit, 2025-01-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1hub00k/what_they_do_in_the_basement_at_lumon_and_why/m5mzz6q/) (in reply to ID 1hub00k):\nThis may be a little scattered, but some stray thoughts I have because I am curious how these would fit in with your theory …\n\nI can buy much of this, but I’m really stuck on Mrs Selvig/Harmony. Why is she so obsessed with proving that reintegration is possible, why did she seemingly encourage Mark to quit, and why, when she was watching him once or twice, did she actually seem to be feeling empathy for his sadness? (The fact she told two separate mother stories – atheist and Catholic – I think could be interpreted as another of her attempts to flush out proof of reintegration.)\n\nIf she proved reintegration was possible, then what? Does this simply give her leverage with the Board, is it possible she’s angling for all innies to live at Lumon to prevent their outies ever proving a problem for the company, or does she secretly want to end the Severance program? Does she genuinely think the company is screwed if it doesn’t refine the Severance process to prevent reintegration, so she thinks she’s helping? \n\nHas Harmony been severed at some point, reintegrated naturally on her own, so wants to prove reintegration is possible without implicating herself in any way? If so, which personality is really her? She never seems to have a “real” personality – in every interaction she rings false and as Harmony she is also unusually awkward, to the degree she’s almost as “strange” as Ms Casey, and as Jame Eagan in the bathroom. \n\nOne thing that really struck me was the fact she mentioned Clark Gable when talking to Devon. It’s exceedingly unlikely a woman of her apparent age would choose a pinup boy from the 1930s as her go-to hot guy reference. You tend to go for contemporaries. This may lend some credibility to the notion that the whole downloaded consciousness concept is already in progress on the testing floor. (Has she been road testing an Eagan consciousness in the form of Mrs Selvig? Perhaps the female CEO who was in charge five CEOs ago?)\n\nAlso, the hospital bracelet wrapped around what was once an oxygen tube in her altar: it’s a Kier/Eagan-based altar, so why would a family memento be in it if Charlotte Cobel (born in 1944) is her mother, unless Charlotte was an Eagan? Or perhaps Harmony is actually the illegitimate child of Charlotte and an Eagan who never acknowledged her, and for some reason she opted to serve Lumon as an employee to be close to her family, and it has manifested as extreme company loyalty. She can’t believe she’d ever really be fired. (Don’t you know who I am?!) \n\n(I have wondered about Harmony road testing an Eagan consciousness since we saw that hospital bracelet, because initially I didn’t see it wrapped around an oxygen tube, so I wondered if it was a baby bracelet. You know who keeps a baby’s bracelet? Its mother. And Harmony looked a whole lot like an actual mother in the way she held Eleanor.)\n\nI can understand Milchick being frantic to prevent being caught using OTC with Dylan, because if the other theories about Irving previously having had Milchick’s job are accurate, then it suggests that Milchick is trying to avoid being fired because it could mean ending up severed like Irving. But if that’s the case, how did Harmony not suffer the same fate?\n\nI go back to Helly’s first question to Mark when he opened the door: “Am I livestock?” Well, maybe – because not all farm animals are raised to be killed. Some serve an ongoing purpose for milk (served at the waffle party) and eggs (egg-bar is coveted AF). Thus, slavery. \n\nI think it’s a given the various stories about coups and the artwork depicting it are there to make the other departments hate each other to prevent fraternisation, because too much talking and trading notes only leads to curiosity about what is really going on, which will disrupt everything. And it has been proven true: Dylan could have smuggled something massively damaging to the company (a hand-to-hand combat instruction card) out of the building thanks to the visit to O&D, and Irving is a true believer who becomes willing to burn the place down because of Burt. Not reading any words but Kier’s is also a rule proven to have a point: the innies’ lack of familiarity with any other form of psychology, philosophy or even written ideas leads to Ricken’s book reading as utterly revolutionary instead of just basically the cliched claptrap it is. It gives Mark and Dylan both the motivation to ask more questions and helps push them forward to agree to use the OTC system. \n\nEven the shitty computer equipment and ancient tech prevents the innies from adequately orienting themselves properly in space and time. The innies may not be aware of things like wifi or the internet at all, and certainly not of AI. They may not even know the year in which they work. \n\nWe don’t know if it is possible to simply wipe the memory of a chip and start over with basically a fresh innie install – could that be why, when Ms Casey has been dead over two years she has only been ‘awake’ for about an hour a week since then – because she’s been reset and refined a few times. But Irving has certainly been haunted by the memory of that testing floor elevator. \n\nThe way episode 2 was edited together, it looks entirely possible that there are things that happen to the soon-to-be innie between drifting off to sleep and waking on the table. Helena’s wearing the same clothes, sure, but that just means she didn’t leave the building, not that she was put on the table and awakened immediately. \n\nAlso! Helly’s clothes are an early clue to her being special, based on the Lexington Letter/MDR Handbook: black, white, navy, grey and pastels are the approved colour palette, but Helly wears various, bright, definitely-not-pastel blues as well as orange, brown and beige. Helena seems to be a major dick, and I can imagine her opting to decide she’s an Eagan, she can wear whatever the eff she wants to work.\n\nAnd the funny little mustache comment Devon made re: Mark’s shrink – could be Dylan, Milchick or Irving. If Irving is a “friend to the insane” and the therapist, then could he have gone to work at Lumon in Milchick’s role before Mark, but had himself severed rather than quit because he was so haunted by what the testing floor really means? Or was he simply demoted to a severed role, and it embittered him (just not enough to quit). Did Irving plant the idea of Mark getting a job at Lumon, or was it Milchick? (Note: the Lexington Letter chain is signed by John Milchick, but Harmony calls Milchick Seth, not John, so alternate names or different people?) \n\nAaahhh tl;dr Ms Cobel be crazy, no?\n\n### Comment ID m5nj39a with +11 score by [(fillgates, Reddit, 2025-01-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1hub00k/what_they_do_in_the_basement_at_lumon_and_why/m5nj39a/) (in reply to ID m5mzz6q):\nCobel is loyal to Kier, not Lumon.

I also think that unlike the basement, which has structure and purpose, Cobel's motivations and emotions have not been fully flushed out by the show yet. I don't think she was severed though.\n\nAs for the oxygen tube, it may have been a Lumon product that sustained her mother's life, and later led her to becoming an Eagan zealot. It's worth noting in the Lexington letters that a newspaper almost published an expose on feeding tubes...\n\n#### Comment ID m5pkjgm with +10 score by [(Realistic_Village184, Reddit, 2025-01-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1hub00k/what_they_do_in_the_basement_at_lumon_and_why/m5pkjgm/) (in reply to ID m5nj39a):\n> Cobel is loyal to Kier, not Lumon.\n\nThat's a really neat distinction that I wouldn't have realized on my own.

I’m not really sure what this means narratively, but it seems important that it’s not just telling two different stories about one parent; it’s probably true. it was also something to clue the audience in on the fact that she wasn’t severed (as she would have no memories of her parents on the severed floor)\n\nI also wonder about how getting “demoted” to a severed position would work: as severance is allegedly irreversible, it’s not like anyone would be able to make their way up the ranks. so what gives? people can only be demoted/punished?\n\n### Comment ID m5pumqe with +5 score by [(FormalJellyfish29, Reddit, 2025-01-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1hub00k/what_they_do_in_the_basement_at_lumon_and_why/m5pumqe/) (in reply to ID m5mzz6q):\nCobel is the most mysterious part of the whole show and it’s wild that, while we know some of her motives, we still have no idea why they are her motives.\n\nI cannot conjure up any explanation of why she would need to put on the Mrs Selvig act. Any way you break it down, it just does not make sense for her to need to play this role. \n\nI’m wildly curious about how this could be explained. It’s not explained by severance because we know Mrs Selvig is an act and we know she’s not severed, nor is she supposed to be severed, just like Milchik & Graner. (They need to keep their memories inside and outside of work for their jobs and they do.) It’s not explained by reintegration because she’s not supposed to be severed in the first place and she would not want to prove reintegration if she were trying to hide her reintegration by acting as two separate roles. It’s not explained by trying to “trick” Mark because even if his memories carried over, he would know what she looks like. Who is the act for??????

I saw a comment on youtube where a person said they believed the chips are separate people completely (which I don't think is the case) but it brings up interesting questions and ideas. Because while bits of Kier's consciousness could be saved or subconscious maybe unlike others (Gemma) his body wasn't and then would he still feel like himself to others? Mark does recreate the tree in his wellness session and he does seem to be working on Gemma's file which would suggest that part of him remembers her.  But the Gemma we met, isn't the Gemma he knew, outies and innies are different so because she's not the essence he knows, he doesn't recognize her. What if they are testing how the subconscious remembers things because maybe only part of Kier's brain was able to be saved?\n\nIrving's outie makes paintings of MDR or the pieces he likely remembers from his dreams, what if an innie's real memories are available to them but only as they'd be in a dream?\n\nAnd Cobel is interested in that piece of it specifically - maybe.\n\n## Comment ID m5kzyp7 with +13 score by [(Extension_Arm6991, Reddit, 2025-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1hub00k/what_they_do_in_the_basement_at_lumon_and_why/m5kzyp7/) (in reply to ID 1hub00k):\nI think they’re just seeing what people will put up with when they don’t know what real life is like on the outside.

Now that they have severance chips, they can use their brains like advanced computers to bring an artificial mind to life, ironically.\n\nIt makes me wonder what the ultimate goal might be.

There are two big hints in S1:\n- Petey’s warning to Mark: “Okay. What if the cost of that help is that you’re murdering people eight hours a day and you don’t even know it?”\n- The Whole Mind Collective protesters’ first say “have a moment for children’s brain health?”. This hints at MDR’s work involving operating on kids’ brains\n  - And their poster suggests MDR is killing children/kids, literally by “hacking” on a computer: “ONE MAY SPEND ONE’S DAY HACKING CHILDREN TO BITS GO HOME TO ONE’S OWN KIDS NONE THE WISER”\n\nFurthermore, the MDR work is isolating emotionally-charged signals (number clusters that feel a certain way) and putting them in bins (aka recycling or trash bins). There are five bins, each with a mixture of four tempers). Why five bins? There are five brain waves brought up elsewhere in the show — each bin could correspond to a lower or higher frequency brain wave (different states of EEG activity): Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma. My hunch is that these signals are coming from the brains of real humans behind the computer screen that MDR can’t see, probably attached to wires in the testing floor.\n\nI think each file is actually a person being refined on the testing floor. Cold Harbor is Gemma / Ms Casey. My guess is that Ms Huang was one of the files they completely refined to meet quota in S1. \n\nWhy are there time limits? Because it’s a human specimen they’re operating on. Perhaps brain death occurs if it takes too long. That’s why Dylan tells Helly they usually only complete 1 in 5 test files.\n\nConnecting the dots, I think it’s more likely that MDR is refining the brains (specifically the “soul/mind”: the identity/personality/consciousness aspect) of real people who could be considered still alive - whether that’s a child (perhaps Ms Huang was Gemma’s baby that Lumon recovered with Gemma) or a partially damaged adult body (Gemma may have brain damage or something but is still viable). They are refining in that they are reorganizing or removing memories which are triggered/associated with emotional resonances (4 tempers). In the attempt to do this, MDR’s success rate is low: only 1 in 5 attempts makes it before they expire (Dylan’s words in e2 or close to it). So whether by allowing test files to expire (human dies) or by completing the file (human’s mind has been refined/purified - ie, their soul is gone, identity is gone because their salient memories of what makes them a person are neutralized), MDR is effectively murdering people (also MDR is short for MurDeR).\n\n## Comment ID mftosqv with +1 score by [(Only_Suggestion_8177, Reddit, 2025-03-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1hub00k/what_they_do_in_the_basement_at_lumon_and_why/mftosqv/) (in reply to ID 1hub00k):\nwhy dylan was set to see his wife regularly?"

      "# [Top 5 Data Lineage Tools (+ How to Choose)](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-lineage-tools)\nThe good news is that business leaders and stakeholders are increasingly seeing the value of data lineage in their organizations. The even better news is that the data lineage tool market offers more options for data teams every year.\n\nAs a whole, the global data catalog market is projected to grow from $878.8 million in 2023 to $4,680.9 million by 2032, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.7% during this period. That’s respectable.\n\nSo, as more data teams enter the market for lineage tools, it’s important to distinguish the apples from the oranges. Much like data lineage itself, knowledge is power when it comes to vetting potential lineage tools.\n\nThat's why we’re showcasing five potentially potent tools for data lineage here, noting the pros, cons, and pricing for each.\n\nData lineage tools: 5 worth considering\n\nGable.ai\n\nGable is a pioneering data contracts platform that's proactively bridging the gap between data producers and consumers. It focuses on proactive data quality management (i.e., shifting data quality left) by implementing data contracts early in the data lifecycle. In doing so, Gable allows teams to draft, define, and enforce data contracts, providing a collaborative environment for software developers, data engineers, and data scientists.\n\nWhile not a traditional data lineage tool, Gable's approach to data contracts offers a unique perspective on lineage. By defining and versioning data contracts, it provides visibility into data origins, transformations, and dependencies, effectively creating a proactive form of lineage tracking that starts at the source of data creation.\n\nPros:\n\nOffers a highly proactive approach to data quality\n\nUniquely able to integrate directly into development workflows\n\nCan also reduce costs and wasted effort by maintaining data integrity early in the process\n\nCons:\n\nAs a relative newcomer, Gable.ai may present a bit of a learning curve compared to other tools listed\n\nPricing: Interested parties should sign up to Gable’s product waitlist to learn more as details become available.\n\nAlation\n\nAlation is a comprehensive data intelligence platform that offers robust data lineage capabilities. It provides automatic table and column-level lineage, along with business lineage featuring metadata overlays. Alation's strength as a lineage tool lies in its advanced visualization capabilities—including end-to-end mini-map previews and data flow filtering.\n\nTogether, these features allow users to trace data from its origin through various transformations to its final use, providing crucial insights for data governance, impact analysis, and regulatory compliance. Alation's lineage capabilities are especially valuable for organizations dealing with complex data ecosystems, as they offer a clear, visual representation of data flows across multiple systems and processes.\n\nPros:\n\nA comprehensive data intelligence solution\n\nOffers advanced visualization capabilities\n\nIntegrates with many data sources\n\nCons:\n\nCan be complex to implement and use\n\nMay also be overkill for organizations with simpler needs\n\n‍\n\nPricing: Alation doesn't publicly disclose pricing. Those interested need to contact sales for a custom quote.\n\nSecoda\n\nSecoda bills itself as a data discovery and documentation platform that emphasizes user-friendliness and automation in its data lineage features. It offers automated data lineage capture and visualization, integrating with a variety of data sources and tools to provide a comprehensive view of data flows.\n\nAs a lineage tool, Secoda stands out for its ability to automatically generate and maintain up-to-date lineage information with a minimal amount of manual input. Its column-level lineage capabilities allow for granular tracking of data transformations, making it easier for organizations to understand data dependencies, troubleshoot issues, and assess the impact of changes across their data ecosystem.\n\nPros:\n\nProvides a user-friendly interface\n\nOffers strong integration capabilities\n\nLineage capture can be automated\n\nCons:\n\nAdvanced features may necessitate a learning curve for some\n\nLike Gable.ai, Scoda is a relatively new player in the market\n\nPricing: At this time Secoda doesn't publicly share pricing information. Curious parties will need to contact sales for a quote.\n\nCollibra\n\nCollibra is a solid data intelligence platform offering a suite of tools for data governance, cataloging, and lineage. Its data lineage capabilities, specifically, provide end-to-end lineage mapping with technical lineage at table, column, and transformation levels.\n\nViewed solely as a lineage tool, Collibra provides data teams with a comprehensive view of data flows across an organization. Its interactive lineage diagrams offer intuitive visual representations of complex data relationships, enabling users to easily trace data origins, understand transformations, and assess the impact of changes.\n\nThis makes Collibra particularly valuable for organizations that need to prioritize data governance, regulatory compliance, and maintain an in-depth understanding of their data landscape.\n\nPros:\n\nViewed as a comprehensive data governance solution\n\nOffers strong data lineage visualization capabilities\n\nVery robust metadata management\n\nCons:\n\nCan be expensive for smaller organizations\n\nComes with a comparatively complex implementation process\n\nPricing: Collibra offers yearly licensing subscriptions:\n\n12-month plan: $170,000\n\n24-month plan: $340,000\n\n36-month plan: $510,000\n\nDbt (data build tool)\n\nKnown primarily as a data transformation tool, dbt does data lineage capabilities. However, said capabilities are more limited compared to other tools featured above. It provides table-level lineage within dbt projects, with column-level lineage available in the dbt Cloud Enterprise tier.\n\nTherefore, when viewed as a potential lineage tool, dbt's strength lies in its native integration with data transformation processes.\n\nDbt does visualize dependencies between models, which helps data teams understand how changes in one part of a data pipeline might affect others.\n\nIts lineage features are more focused on assets managed within dbt projects—making this integration of particular value for organizations already using dbt, as it provides immediate insights into the lineage of transformed data without the need for additional tools.\n\nPros:\n\nNative integration with data transformation processes\n\nOpen-source core with active community\n\nVisualizes dependencies between models\n\nCons:\n\nLimited to dbt-managed assets\n\nFull column-level lineage only available in its Enterprise tier\n\nPricing: dbt offers three subscription tiers:\n\nCore: Free and open-source\n\nCloud Team: Starts at $50 per user per month\n\nCloud Enterprise: Custom pricing, make inquiries to dbt’s sales team\n\nWhy are data lineage tools important?\n\nAs a refresher, know that data lineage tools should increasingly be seen as table-stakes for modern organizations to establish (and reap the multitude of rewards from) robust data governance and management practices.\n\nIt’s these tools that provide the features and functionality that make fostering and maintaining pristine data quality possible.\n\nEnhanced data transparency and visibility\n\nData lineage tools provide a clear and real-time view of how data flows across an organization, enabling stakeholders to gain deeper insights into data usage, dependencies, and transformations.\n\nOft-overlooked, this transparency also contributes to a culture of impactful data-driven decision-making.\n\nImproved data quality and accuracy\n\nAutomated data lineage tools help identify data quality issues by highlighting anomalies, transformations, and potential errors in the lineage. This early detection allows data teams, stewards, and scientists to address issues promptly, ensuring data remains accurate and reliable.\n\nEfficient compliance and auditing\n\nData lineage is essential for regulatory compliance, especially in industries with strict and/or complex data regulations. These tools provide an audit trail demonstrating how data is used and processed, facilitating compliance reporting and audits.\n\nStreamlined data governance\n\nData lineage simplifies data governance by providing a clear understanding of data assets, their ownership, and the impact of made changes. As a result, lineage tools make it easier to enforce data policies and maintain optimal data quality.\n\nFaster troubleshooting and issue resolution\n\nWhen data issues arise, lineage tools enable faster troubleshooting by allowing data professionals to trace problems back to their source, identify root causes, and implement solutions as quickly as possible.\n\nEnhanced data security\n\nData lineage helps organizations identify vulnerabilities in their data pipelines and access controls, allowing for the implementation of robust security measures to safeguard sensitive information.\n\nEffective change management\n\nBy visualizing how data flows are impacted by changes, teams can assess potential risks and make informed decisions during system upgrades or process modifications.\n\nSupport for data-driven decision making\n\nData lineage empowers more people (both data professionals and their data-adjacent peers) to understand and leverage data assets, supporting true data democratization and enabling more informed decision-making throughout the organization.\n\nOperational efficiency\n\nBy automating data mapping and reducing the need for manual impact analysis, data lineage tools can save significant time and resources, enhancing overall operational efficiency.\n\nRisk management\n\nData lineage manages risks associated with data usage, transformations, and access by providing a comprehensive view of data flow and dependencies.\n\nHow to choose the right data lineage tool\n\nSituations, organizational needs, technical capabilities, and lineage tools themselves are all always in flux—so there will never be a one “best” way to go about choosing the right data lineage tool.\n\nThat said, by carefully considering the following factors and aligning them with your organization's specific requirements, you can streamline to process of learning about and comparing tools, ensuring the chosen tool provides the most value and the best fit possible:\n\nDetermine scope and depth of lineage tracking: Look for tools that provide comprehensive lineage at multiple levels—table, column, and row-level lineage. Ensure the tool captures lineage across your entire data ecosystem, not just from limited sources like BI tools.\n\nReview integration capabilities: The tool should integrate well with your existing data stack, including data warehouses, ETL/ELT tools, BI platforms, etc. Check the depth of integrations—some tools may claim to integrate with a platform but only offer surface-level connectivity.\n\nCompare visualization and analysis features: Clear, intuitive visualizations of data lineage are crucial for understanding complex data flows. Look for capabilities like impact analysis, data flow mapping, and the ability to trace data upstream and downstream.\n\nDetermine if automation and metadata collection is necessary: Automated lineage capture reduces manual effort and improves accuracy. The tool should be able to automatically collect and update metadata as your data environment changes.\n\nVet each tool’s ability to scale: Ensure the tool can handle your current data volume and complexity, as well as scale as your data ecosystem grows.\n\nConsider usability and accessibility: The tool should be user-friendly for both technical and non-technical team members. Features like search functionality and collaborative capabilities are valuable.\n\nInquire about compliance and governance support: If regulatory compliance is a concern, look for tools that offer features to support data governance and compliance efforts.\n\nAsses potential performance impact: Consider how the lineage tool might affect the performance of your data systems, especially for large-scale implementations.\n\nWeigh cost against potential ROI: Evaluate the pricing model and ensure it aligns with your budget and expected value from implementing data lineage.\n\nPrioritize future-proofing: Choose a tool that can adapt to evolving data architectures and technologies.\n\nGet a sense of each tool’s support and community: Consider the level of support provided by the vendor and the existence of an active user community for knowledge sharing.\n\nDetermine if complementary features are available: Some tools offer additional features like data quality monitoring or data cataloging that may provide added value.\n\nLooking to shift your lineage left?\n\nAgain, the right data lineage tools can dramatically enhance data governance, transparency, and quality within your organization. But it should now be crystal clear that choosing the right solution is crucial. Whether you're looking to streamline compliance, ensure data accuracy, or improve decision-making, having the right tool in your data stack is non-negotiable.\n\nGable.ai goes beyond traditional lineage solutions by introducing proactive data contracts, which tackle data quality at the source. By implementing Gable.ai's innovative approach, you’ll be setting your team up for long-term success, maintaining data integrity, and reducing costly errors early in the process.\n\nTo learn more about how Gable.ai can empower your organization with next-level data contracts and improve your overall data management strategy, sign up for our product waitlist today.\n\n‍",

      "# [x15ventures names Gable as Xccelerate winner](https://www.commbank.com.au/articles/newsroom/2025/02/xccelerate.html)\nThe Commonwealth Bank’s venture-scaling arm, x15ventures, has named data change management platform, Gable, as the winner of its latest Xccelerate program. The startup has secured a SAFE Note investment and is actively exploring multiple partnership opportunities with CommBank.\n\nFounded in Seattle in 2023 by Daniel Dicker, James Frost, Adrian Kreuziger and Chad Sanderson, Gable helps developers ensure quality and governance of important data as it flows through an organisation.\n\n“Before Gable, the founders worked at a late-stage startup where we were constantly wrestling with problems caused by the quality, governance and change management of source data,” Gable CEO Chad Sanderson, explained. “That’s why we founded Gable, to help businesses understand where their data is, who owns it and where it's going.”\n\nGable’s platform uses AI to identify where data is produced from within an organisation and monitor how it flows across services and databases. This helps flag sensitive data like personally identifiable information (PII) and trigger alerts within an environment when compliance or quality standards are at risk.\n\n“In a world in which organisations rely on more apps and services than ever before, having clarity around the quality and lineage of your data is critical. This is particularly true for those operating in regulated industries, where reporting obligations continue to evolve and businesses are looking to take full advantage of AI,” x15 Chief Technology Officer Kelvin Lim said.\n\n“We were impressed with how Gable’s approach could help shift important work – for example, tracking changes to critical data, identifying PII or sensitive data, and setting compliance policies – into the hands of our engineers. This gives them the confidence that any code changes made won’t inadvertently break things, helping to prevent complex data problems downstream and freeing up testing, governance and compliance teams to focus on what they do best\" Mr Lim added.\n\n\"With numerous ventures in our portfolio, and lots of different ways they generate data, it's important we know exactly where that data flows. Gable’s tech could enable us to do that in a unique and efficient way – and we’re really excited to explore what's possible.”\n\nGable was one of nearly 100 startups to apply for the latest Xccelerate program, which focused on solutions ‘ reimagining the customer and employee experience with data and AI’. It was the first time the program was open to international as well as homegrown founders.\n\nAs a result of winning Xccelerate, Gable will now commence a project with x15 to detect code changes across its isolated technology environment, while exploring a number of more expansive opportunities across CommBank.\n\n“We believe organisations stand to gain a lot from creating a shared data culture of collaboration, accountability, quality and governance. It was clear from early in the program that x15 not only shares that view but had already taken steps to shift more risk management into the hands of its engineers,” Mr Sanderson said.\n\n“Even to be exploring potential partnerships with CommBank – a recognised leader in financial services innovation and AI maturity – feels like a vote of confidence in our mission. We think we’re building something special here, and I look forward to spending more time in Australia over the coming months to explore what Gable, x15 and CommBank could achieve together.”\n\nAs a result of the 2024 program, three other finalists – Cleric, Dragonfly Thinking and Eidiex – are also actively exploring partnership opportunities with CommBank.\n\nAbout x15ventures\n\nx15ventures is a venture scaler powered by CommBank. Founded in 2020, x15 builds, buys and invests in startups that would benefit from connections to Australia’s leading bank, and could improve the lives of its more than 15 million customers, by either reimagining existing CommBank products or services, or offering solutions not traditionally classed as finance, but that could extend the bank’s relationship and relevance with customers.\n\nx15’s platform model combines the latest cloud technology (running on a separate tech stack to CommBank) with enterprise grade controls, enabling ventures to innovate at pace in a 'bank safe' environment, and scale through access to CommBank assets – including capital, brand, and customer distribution – once ready.\n\nFor more, please visit: x15ventures.com.au\n\nAbout Xccelerate\n\nXccelerate helps early-stage founders understand pathways to partnership with the Bank, connecting them with mentors and experts within x15 and CommBank to help accelerate the growth of their businesses.\n\nTo be eligible for Xccelerate, applicants were required to be pre-Series A and aligned with the program theme and CommBank’s AI Principles, which apply to all AI systems designed, developed, deployed, or used by the bank.\n\nPast Xccelerate alumni include financial workflow management company, Paytron (2022), which has since been acquired by ASX-listed OFX, and agtech integrator, Pairtree Intelligence (2023). Automotive retail platform provider Vyro has also leveraged connections it forged through Xccelerate23 to secure a partnership with CommBank and digital auto marketplace, carsales.",

From Alaska to Mississippi, each organization is helping prepare new tradespeople as rising wages fuel more career opportunities. Over the past 12 months in construction alone, average hourly earnings have risen 4.4%, according to Associated Builders and Contractors.\n\n\"We listen closely to contractors and know that many candidates don't have the necessary skills to fill the wide range of open trades positions,\" said Janice Dupré, Lowe's executive vice president of human resources and chair of the Lowe's Foundation. \"Through modern training methods, these nonprofits are unlocking the workforce's potential while building an economy that rewards skills, not just titles or four-year degrees.\"\n\nSince 2023, the Lowe's Foundation has awarded over $34 million in Gable Grants to help educate and advocate for the next generation of skilled tradespeople. The grants support training programs focusing on carpentry and construction, HVAC, electrical, plumbing and appliance repair.\n\n\"We are grateful for the support of the Lowe's Foundation and their Gable Grants that will help fund the training of the next generation of skilled trade professionals,\" said Jim Tobin, CEO of the National Association of Home Builders. \"All of these deserving grant recipients play a pivotal role in helping to strengthen the residential construction workforce, and we stand in support of their efforts.\"\n\nThe new Lowe's Foundation Gable Grants support the following community-based nonprofits:\n\nAlaska Works (Anchorage, Alaska) will expand its free, hands-on construction training program in Anchorage, Fairbanks and the Mat-Su region. The expansion includes additional funds for carpentry, plumbing and electrical training to include building maintenance and additional support for participants.\n\nHope Renovations (Carrboro, North Carolina) plans to double its number of skilled trades graduates by offering more cohorts at its Raleigh and Durham locations. Its pre-apprenticeship program empowers individuals to enter the construction industry while offering critical home repairs for adults aging in place.\n\nLatino Academy of Workforce Development (Madison, Wisconsin) will support various cohorts of students through a bilingual skilled trades program featuring industry-recognized safety certifications, blueprint reading, financial education and more. For over a decade, the nonprofit has worked closely with employers and regional workforce development boards to support over 10,000 individuals in south-central Wisconsin.\n\nMoore Community House (Biloxi, Mississippi) will build on its construction program with an electrical 101 course, specific to residential construction. The nonprofit will also grow its pre-apprenticeship course through modules that introduce masonry, flooring, roof framing, HVAC and plumbing.\n\nNext Step of West Michigan (Grand Rapids, Michigan) will equip its new training facility to continue construction on dozens of tiny and small homes through a seven-week training program. The nonprofit offers on-the-job training and employment opportunities in construction, carpentry and wood product manufacturing.\n\nNontraditional Employment for Women (New York) plans to recruit and train more than 300 individuals annually for building and construction trades careers. The grant will also support individualized employment plans, peer support and mentoring events as the nonprofit expands its size and operations.\n\nNorth Alabama Homebuilding Academy (Huntsville, Alabama) will reach hundreds of new aspiring skilled trades students across Alabama through new satellite programs and a 16-session course. The course culminates with a job fair featuring local employers who have immediate hiring needs and is supported by the Huntsville Madison County Builders Association, a chapter of the National Association of Home Builders.\n\nSER Metro-Detroit Jobs for Progress (Detroit) will expand ReBuild Detroit, a free eight-week apprenticeship readiness training program licensed by the state of Michigan. The program offers industry-recognized credentials, including OSHA 30, and career pathways in the skilled trades through SER's extensive network of employer partners.\n\nTrade Institute of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh) will increase the capacity of its 10-week, tuition-free masonry and carpentry training program by 25% while exploring expansion beyond Pittsburgh. The grant will also support new instructors and case managers to help remove barriers to employment through holistic services like life coaching and therapy.\n\nUncommon Construction (New Orleans) will enhance its alumni Career Pathways program, develop certification curriculum for adults and complete renovations to its new training facility. The organization offers on-the-job training to support safe and affordable housing in the area.\n\nAdditionally, the Lowe's Foundation has awarded a Gable Grant to Boys & Girls Clubs of America (BGCA) as a new national nonprofit partner. BGCA will use its grant to enhance skilled trades job readiness programs for young adults (ages 16-24) at three pilot club locations in Hobe Sound, Florida; Madison, Wisconsin; and Seattle.\n\nThe foundation has also renewed partnerships with national nonprofits Goodwill Industries International, Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC), the National Center for Construction Education and Research (NCCER) and SkillsUSA. These partnerships will continue to support a variety of skilled trades training programs, including wraparound services and targeted workforce development in communities impacted by natural disasters.\n\nThe next Gable Grant application cycle for community and technical colleges will run from March 1 to March 31.

Minnesota said he is expected to make his season debut on Nov. 24 against Campbell.\n\n“Gable has the burning desire to compete for the Maroon and Gold one last time,” Eggum said. “We are thankful he has chosen the opportunity to add to his historic legacy with our program. He is one of the best to ever compete in the sport of wrestling, and we are grateful for the impact has had at our program.”\n\nSteveson tried professional wrestling with World Wrestling Entertainment and performed up mostly in NXT, the company’s developmental brand. After his release this year, he tried out for the NFL’s Buffalo Bills despite never having played organized football. He did not make the roster.",
      "# [Gable Steveson banks on himself in career switch: From wrestling champ to NFL bid with the Bills by John Wawrow on 2024-06-11](https://apnews.com/article/buffalo-bills-gable-steveson-wrestling-nfl-4a2fc35c86b8c7247cea4bca8fad7263)\nORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) — Gable Steveson thought he achieved the impossible with his stunning last-second takedown of three-time world wrestling champion Geno Petriashvili to win gold at the Tokyo Games.\n\nThree years later, the 24-year-old Steveson is raising the degree of difficulty in approaching his next challenge: Pro football. Having never played a down of football in his life, he is the rawest of NFL rookies in opening his second week of practice with the Buffalo Bills on Tuesday.\n\nIt’s a passion project and a personal challenge for Steveson to see how far he can stretch his athletic abilities. Or, as the two-time national collegiate wrestling champion from Minnesota put it following practice, “Do the impossible.”\n\n“This is definitely a unicorn situation,” Steveson said. “For me to finally push that narrative of you can come from one sport to another: that’s an incredible thing. And I hope people realize this and can see that they can do whatever they want with their lives.”\n\nAt 5-foot-11 and 266 pounds, Steveson’s career change from super heavyweight wrestler to defensive lineman follows a failed bid with World Wrestling Entertainment. After joining the WWE to much fanfare, he was mostly part of its developmental brand, NXT, before being released last month.\n\nSteveson said he was in the midst of moving boxes, when the Bills called, asking him to attend a tryout. He showed enough raw promise for Buffalo to sign him to a standard three-year undrafted rookie contract — conditional on him making the roster.\n\n“The first time I ever put on football cleats was at this tryout,” he said. “I gave it my all, and I wanted the opportunity to show that I could be something. And that’s what this is about.”\n\nOne big factor working in Steveson’s favor is Bills coach Sean McDermott, a two-time high school national wrestling champion growing up in Pennsylvania. And while McDermott went on to pursue football after high school, he’s credited wrestling for helping shape his life.\n\nMcDermott joked to The Associated Press that Steveson has a far deeper grasp of wrestling than he does. What matters is McDermott knowing a lot more about football and being familiar with how wrestling fundamentals — leverage, hand-fighting and foot speed — can translate into football, especially among linemen.\n\nMcDermott has even introduced wrestling terms to help Steveson’s transition, with the toughest part involving learning a playbook.\n\n“In wrestling, we don’t have 10 different directions to go. Here you got to read a pass. You’ve got to read a reach and a base and all those funky words,” he said. “But I came in here just a blank slate and ready to learn. And I’m a week in and I feel like I’m light years ahead.”\n\nAnother adjustment is having to wear a helmet, which proved heavier than Steveson expected.\n\nWhat fascinates him is being on the same team as pass-rusher Von Miller, someone he grew up watching win a Super Bowl with the Denver Broncos.\n\nHis new teammates are equally in wonder of Steveson.\n\n“You talk about being the best at what you do, he is literally the best at what he does,” said defensive tackle Ed Oliver, who has since learned of Steveson’s win over Petriashvili.\n\n“To have a guy of his caliber, just to be around him, from the mental aspect of what it takes to get in that arena when it’s just him and another opponent. He knows what it’s like just having that one-on-one battle,” Oliver said. “He is just learning to play football. I wouldn’t put any expectations on it. I don’t want to. But I think he will be all right though.”\n\nSteveson laughed at the memory of how his mother wouldn’t allow him to play football growing up.\n\n“She was scared. But I said, ‘Mom, you put me in the hardest sport, wrestling,‘” he said. “So when this opportunity arose, she was like, ‘This is all you. You’re a grown man now. Go ahead and do it.’”\n\nThe Bills and Steveson are taking his development one small step at a time.\n\n“If you’re looking all the way to September, you’re not going to get far. I’m looking for the present,” Steveson said.\n\n“I want to give Buffalo my everything. I know the fans out there are going to care about this moment, and all the wrestling fans are going to care about this moment,” he added. “I just want to be that person that, ‘Hey, here’s a guy who’s never done it and he’s going to do it.’ And I believe in myself.”\n\n___",

They are designed for durability and low maintenance, and they are lightweight, further easing installation.\n\nMid-America’s new gable vents work with all types of siding, including engineered wood, fiber cement, vinyl, stucco, wood, shake, metal and brick. Available in four shapes—14”x14” square, 14”x20” rectangle, 20”x26” rectangle, and 22” octagon—they also come in 20 SolidThru™ standard colors and 250 custom colors to match your siding.\n\nTo learn more, visit www.midamericacomponents.com.\n\nAbout Westlake Royal Building Products\n\nWestlake Royal Building Products USA Inc., a Westlake company (NYSE: WLK), is a leader throughout North America in the innovation, design, and production of a broad and diverse range of exterior and interior building products, including Siding and Accessories, Trim and Mouldings, Roofing, Stone, Windows and Outdoor Living.

      "# [Wikipedia by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2021-08-02](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AllSides)\nRates online written news outlets for political bias\n\nExternal image https://www.allsides.com/media-bias/media-bias-chart\n\nAllSides Technologies Inc. is an American company that estimates the perceived political bias of content on online written news outlets. AllSides presents different versions of similar news stories from sources it rates as being on the political right, left, and center, with a mission to show readers news outside their filter bubble and expose media bias.[1] AllSides was created by current owner and CEO John Gable.\n\nFocusing on online publications, AllSides rates sources on a five-point scale. Each source is ranked by unpaid volunteer editors, overseen by two staff members holding political biases different from each other. These crowd-sourced reviews are augmented by editorial reviews performed by staff members. Reassessments may be made based on like button results from crowd-sourced community feedback. AllSides uses these rankings to produce media bias charts listing popular sources.[2]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nAllSides was founded in 2012 by John Gable, a former Silicon Valley manager working at Netscape, and Scott McDonald, a software developer.[3][4][5][6][7]\n\nIn 2016, AllSides partnered with activist Joan Blades to launch a classroom program, AllSides for Schools, and has partnered with other organizations to provide programs such as Mismatch, a platform to connect users who differ politically and geographically.[8][9]\n\nContent\n\n[edit]\n\nRating system\n\n[edit]\n\nAllSides staff self-report their political leanings.[2] In 2012, Gable stated that AllSides aims to highlight media bias in the United States and \"show all the news from the left, center and right\".[4] As of 2021, AllSides is funded through paid memberships, one-time donations, media literacy training and online advertisements.[2]\n\nAllSides focuses only on online written content (not TV, radio or podcasts).[2] It rates sources on a left–right scale that is then grouped into five categories (left, leans left, center, leans right, and right) instead of a gradient which the company acknowledged sacrifices precision in favor of simplicity.[2] AllSides posts these ratings alongside the articles it posts on its site.\n\nEducational content\n\n[edit]\n\nAllSides partnered with Living Room Conversations, a nonprofit founded by progressive entrepreneur and activist Joan Blades, on educational content through a related organization called AllSides for Schools. Gable, Blades, and their associated organizations have produced lesson plans for schools on how to navigate political conversations and helped create Mismatch, a platform to connect students who differ politically and geographically.[8][9][10]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nJake Sheridan from the Poynter Institute noted the controversy surrounding bias rating charts in general and recommended that readers consider the reliability of sources in addition to possible bias.[2] He also quoted Kelly McBride as acknowledging bias as an important factor, but not the most important, especially if the charts give a false sense of reliability.[2] Sheridan quoted Tim Groeling as cautioning that while bias is important, charts are not something most consumers would navigate.[2] Both Groeling and McBride praised the methodology of AllSides and Ad Fontes.[2] In 2019, The Guardian columnist John Harris lamented that his experience using AllSides did not help him, as he hoped, to take the mutual loathing out of his news diet.[11]\n\nDashka Slater includes AllSides in a list of organizations with a nonpartisan mission to encourage Americans to interact respectfully.[12]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nOrganizations\n\n[edit]\n\nGlobal Disinformation Index\n\nMedia Bias/Fact Check\n\nNewsGuard\n\nOur.News"
