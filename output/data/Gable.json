      "# [What is DataOps? What Leaders Need to Know](https://www.gable.ai/blog/dataops)\nSomething interesting is taking place in the world of DataOps right now. A big something. But what’s really interesting is what’s at play behind the scenes.\n\nAccording to our friends at Global Market Insights (GMI), the calculated annual growth rate (CAGR) of the DataOps platform marketplace is projected to grow 22% from 2023 to 2032 (i.e., less than one decade). By comparison, this is potentially 1% more than the much-buzzed-about low-code application marketplace is projected to grow during the same time.\n\nHowever, the factors driving DataOps aren’t quite as clear compared to low-code.\n\nData orchestration capabilities need to keep pace with the growing volume and complexity of Big Data, and this is part of the reason for this exceptional amount of growth. Improving customer service and experience, increasing operational efficiency, and maintaining competitive advantages are ongoing priorities for businesses.\n\nHowever, this near-exponential investment in DataOps may be due to a reckoning between two other causal trends—the increasing business need for real-time data insights and the growing impact of data governance and compliance globally.\n\nTo better understand why, let’s start by breaking down DataOps, covering its core principles, best practices, and implementation challenges within modern organizations.\n\nA basic definition of DataOps\n\nFor those who work in leadership or data-adjacent teams, DataOps is a lot like shifted paradigms—no doubt you’ve heard it mentioned while doing business. However, lacking any direct experience, what exactly DataOps is may be less than clear. Let’s correct this now.\n\nDataOps is short for Data Operations. It is a process-oriented methodology that shares and builds on many characteristics of Agile methodologies, DevOps, and lean manufacturing. Simply, the goal of DataOps is to reduce the cycle time of data analytics. In practice, it does so by streamlining collection from data sources to consumption by data consumers.\n\nBroadly speaking, the DataOps process is driven through an organized emphasis on automation, collaboration, and communication. For good reason, this means DataOps and DevOps cross streams quite often in practice. Both are instrumental in keeping Big Data and business value from being at odds.\n\nWe’ve done our best to compare and contrast both processes elsewhere. But know that exploring the core pillars of DataOps helps clarify the distinct role it plays.\n\nCore principles of modern DataOps\n\nAndy Palmer coined the term \"DataOps\" in 2015, describing it as the intersection of data engineering, data quality, and data integration with a focus on various data professionals in a given organization communicating and collaborating to increase the velocity, reliability, and quality of data analytics.\n\nWhile the concept and practice of DataOps has evolved and expanded beyond Palmer’s definition the core principles that enable professionals to put DataOps into practice remain largely the same:\n\n1. Automation and Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)\n\nThe beating heart of DataOps is automation, which aims to reduce manual efforts related to data validation, integration, and deployment processes.\n\nThis often includes automating data ingestion, testing, monitoring, and deployment within a build/deployment pipeline to ensure both consistency and reliability.\n\n2. Agile and lean methodologies\n\nPractitioners work to streamline data management processes by incorporating agile and lean methodologies.\n\nAgile’s focus on flexibility, continuous improvement, and the delivery of high-quality products in short cycles enables data teams to accelerate experimentation and adaptation based on feedback. Lean methodologies, in turn, guide teams to streamline data pipelines, minimize inefficiencies, and ensure that data delivery remains firmly coupled to business needs.\n\n3. Collaboration and alignment\n\nEffective DataOps encourages a culture of collaboration and alignment among cross-functional teams, which typically includes data engineers, scientists, and business stakeholders.\n\nFostering collaboration in this fashion ensures data products align with business needs and that data analysts can deliver all insights efficiently.\n\n4. Cloud-first and scalable infrastructure\n\nModern DataOps ecosystems should prioritize cloud-based solutions for optimal scalability and flexibility.\n\nThis principle specifically supports distributed data processing and storage, enabling organizations to scale data operations as needed.\n\n5. Highly automated and continuous processes\n\nDataOps ecosystems should feature high levels of automation to manage the scale and scope of enterprise data efficiently and effectively.\n\nIn practice, this often includes automating the cataloging, movement, and organization of data, in addition to testing and releasing processes.\n\n6. Openness and interoperability\n\nAn ecosystem in which DevOps practitioners leverage best-in-class, open-source, and potentially free tools is essential for innovation. The inverse also holds true—DataOps practitioners should avoid reliance on single, proprietary platforms (as opposed to a variety of tools that are easy to integrate and replace).\n\nThis ease of integration should also apply to a broad spectrum of potential data sources (e.g., data lakes, data warehouses) to improve data quality and governance.\n\n7. Data quality and governance\n\nImplementing robust data governance guidelines and practices is essential to ensure high data quality.\n\nAt a minimum, governance should involve data validation, cleaning, and reconciliation processes which can ensure accuracy and reliability throughout the data lifecycle.\n\n8. Ephemeral environments and code reuse\n\nEphemeral environments are temporary by nature, so using them for testing further enhances flexibility and accelerates development. As such, they reduce the risk of conflicts between environments while promoting resource efficiency.\n\nCode reuse helps practitioners maintain consistency, reduce errors, and save time by avoiding duplications of effort. Additionally, containerization encapsulates applications and their dependencies into containers that can run reliably in different computing environments.\n\n9. Monitoring, observability, and customer centricity\n\nDataOps practitioners should prioritize continuous monitoring and observability of data pipelines, ensuring data availability, performance, and security. This is vital for identifying, addressing, and resolving issues as quickly as possible.\n\nWhile DataOps practitioners focus on reducing cycle times for data delivery, enabling faster insights, and improving data-driven decision-making, ultimately everything done must remain rooted in delivering value to the organization’s end-users and customers.\n\nBeing such an elemental aspect of any data practice, it’s also beneficial to explore how other data leaders articulate their core principles of DataOps. For an excellent perspective to which we can compare and contrast the above, we recommend looking at DataKitchen’s seminal DataOps Cookbook (that is, after finishing our own article, here, of course).\n\nDataOps best practices\n\nIf core principles are one side of the DataOps coin, best practices are the other. Without them, no amount of core principles would allow organizations to actively streamline their data management processes, accelerate their insight generation, and (perhaps most fundamentally) improve data quality.\n\nBecause of this, DataOps best practices naturally intertwine with the principles outlined above. But the key best practices are still worth detailing, as they are applicable across industries and organizations:\n\nFoster a collaborative culture\n\nThe existence of departmental silos within organizations is understandable. But they aren’t acceptable. This is why DataOps best practices begin by breaking down obstacles and fostering communication and collaboration between teams—data engineers, data scientists, business users, stakeholders, and operations.\n\nDataOps makes data quality and accessibility a shared responsibility across an organization, which, in turn, sets the stage for all best practices that follow.\n\nAdopt a customer-centric approach\n\nToo often, adopting a customer-centric approach emerges as an afterthought in the practice of DataOps. This borders on being a tragic irony, as the benefits of DataOps itself—enhanced value delivery, promoting agility and responsiveness, driving innovation, fueling trust and loyalty, etc.—can only be fully realized by engaging with end-users to understand their needs, challenges, and desires.\n\nImplement agile methodologies\n\nLook to agile practices like sprints and scrums to manage data projects, allowing for rapid iteration and responses to change. Practitioners can also use Agile approaches to prioritize work based on business needs and value.\n\nHowever, it bears noting that when practitioners seek to leverage Agile as a DataOps best practice, they must ensure its impact is balanced and holistic within the organization. When employed dogmatically, these Agile methodologies can muddle the practice of proper documentation, over-complicate data management, erode data quality for the sake of responsiveness, and potentially introduce security and compliance risks.\n\nFor these reasons, make sure that Agile within your organization is used as part of the overall DataOps solution, not a solution unto itself.\n\nAutomate data pipelines\n\nActively implement CI/CD pipelines in order to automate data integration, testing, deployment, and monitoring processes. In addition to this best practice of reducing manual efforts and errors, CI/CD pipelines help ensure seamless, automated updates and deployments.\n\nEmbrace continuous testing\n\nLeverage automation to test data quality, data integration, and performance throughout the organization’s data lifecycle.\n\nFurthermore, test-driven development (TDD) approaches should be adopted for data-related code and pipelines. TDD encourages earlier issue identification and potential integration issues while contributing to overall data quality.\n\nMake version control ubiquitous\n\nTrack changes and facilitate collaboration by utilizing version control for all data assets—code, configurations, and data modeling, to name a few.\n\nAdditionally, data versioning strategies should be considered to manage changes in datasets. Doing so enables reproducibility and replicability, supports the experimentation and iteration that DataOps champions, and allows organizations to demonstrate the lineage and provenance of their data.\n\nObsessively monitor data quality and performance\n\nThe ability to identify and solution for issues quickly requires the continuous monitoring of pipeline performance and data quality.\n\nEstablishing key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics related to quality is itself key for operationalizing effective monitoring capabilities.\n\nEnsure data security and compliance\n\nData security, privacy, and compliance checks should be embedded through data pipelines to protect sensitive information while helping the organization comply with all relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).\n\nThese compliance checks also require regular reviews, and security practices must be updated to keep pace with ever-evolving threats and regulations.\n\nInvest in scalable and flexible infrastructure\n\nUtilize cloud services and technologies that bolster operational pillars of effective DataOps, scalability, optimal data processing, and organizational flexibility.\n\nIn doing so, data teams should consider adopting data virtualization and containerization capabilities to improve agility and resource efficiency.\n\nLeverage metadata management while planning for growth\n\nWork to implement robust metadata management practices to improve data discoverability, understanding, and governance.\n\nAs part of planning for future (perhaps inevitable) growth, design data architectures and systems to allow for easy adaption and scaling. Use metadata to automate data lineage, data cataloging, and impact analysis.\n\nEmbrace ongoing learning\n\nAs part of laying the foundations for future growth, DataOps initiatives should encourage team members to continually seek out, evaluate, and adopt emerging technologies and practices that will benefit the organization over time.\n\nDataOps is a journey, not a destination. As such, opportunities and areas of improvement should always be identified as part of a culture of testing, learning, and growing.\n\nCommon roadblocks to DataOps implementation (and how data contracts help)\n\nWhether an organization is just getting off the ground or has already experienced some measure of success, DataOps practices may be poorly defined or functionality non-existent. This is also common and commonly attributed to one or a combination of many of the challenges that follow. Fortunately, drafting and implementing a robust data contract can help in all cases.\n\nChange-averse cultures\n\nIt’s not uncommon for progressive thinkers to face resistance from within when trying to inspire a shift towards more collaborative, agile approaches to data management. Reluctance to adopt new processes (even those that are clearly beneficial) in addition to existing departmental silos can hinder DataOps initiatives before they can even begin.\n\nIn these situations, the data contract drafting process can act as a cultural balm, as it necessitates a clear definition of expectations, responsibilities, and roles of all parties involved in data management and usage (not just those directly involved in data analytics). The drafting process also mitigates resistance to new workflows by setting and/or codifying standardized processes all stakeholders must agree upon.\n\nSkill or knowledge deficits\n\nEven a modest implementation of DataOps requires a healthy mix of skills that span data engineering, data science, software development, and operations. Depending on their size or maturity, an organization may lack the diverse skill set and experience needed to integrate these distinct disciplines effectively.\n\nNo data contract is capable of directly addressing gaps in skills and experience. The implementation of data contracts does, however, clarify standards and requirements for data security, access, and quality. As such, they can indirectly guide employee training and development.\n\nInadequate data governance\n\nAs mentioned, effective DataOps relies on the foundation of solid data governance. Therefore, organizations may struggle to implement governance frameworks that are both robust and agile enough to support modern DataOps practices.\n\nData contracts directly support governance within an organization by establishing clear guidelines for data usage, sharing, and management. The framework for compliance and data quality standards established as they’re drafted makes governance more actionable and aligned with ensuing DataOps goals.\n\nComplexities regarding data integration\n\nThe ability to integrate data from a variety of sources presents significant technical challenges, especially in complex or legacy IT environments. This complexity can stall the progress of DataOps implementation by making data pipelines hard to manage or brittle.\n\nConversely, data contracts simplify integration efforts by specifying data interfaces, standards, and formats. This ensures that raw data from any number of sources will be compatible with the organization’s data infrastructure and can be processed and analyzed with optimal efficiency.\n\nPervasive data quality issues\n\nPoor data quality is (unfortunately) a common challenge in the business world, undermining analytics and eroding trust in data-driven decision-making. This can be an open secret too, with employees painfully aware of the issues substandard data is causing while struggling to quantify what exactly is to blame.\n\nThe metrics, validation processes, and remediation steps for non-compliance that data contracts define can make this a non-issue within organizations. This proactive approach (which is always ideal, especially in enterprise data environments) quickly becomes instrumental in maintaining high data quality across the organization.\n\nDifficulties in scaling data operations\n\nFinally, as organizations grow, it’s increasingly challenging to scale data operations efficiently while maintaining data quality. DataOps aims to address scalability issues but, ironically, a lack of foresight and flexibility regarding processes and infrastructure can prevent this from happening.\n\nData contracts circumvent these issues through the guidelines and expectations for data infrastructure, processing capabilities, and performance metrics they crystalize. This ensures that as the volume of data an organization must subsist on grows, systems and processes adapt and scale accordingly.\n\nDrafting an optimal DataOps process\n\nIt’s clear that DataOps functions best at the genetic level of data-driven organizations. It’s also clear that, given such high stakes in the market, business leaders should be doing everything in their power to get their own DataOps right.\n\nAs covered in the last section, data contracts serve as an excellent solution to ensure this happens. That said, the benefits these contracts bring to a data-centric organization extend far beyond DataOps.\n\nFor a quick, digestible, informative primer on data contracts, give Why Data Leaders Opt for Ounces Over Pounds a read.\n\nThis article is part of our blog at Gable.ai — where our goal is to create a shared data culture of collaboration, accountability, quality, and governance.\n\nCurrently, our industry-first approach to drafting and implementing data contracts is in private Beta.",
      "# [About Gable](https://www.gable.ai/about-gable)\nIn 2019, the Gable co-founders: Chad (CEO), Adrian (CTO), and Daniel (Founding Engineer) worked together on the Data Platform team at a late-stage freight tech startup called Convoy. Data was incredibly valuable at Convoy. It drove everything from a central pricing model to dashboards that powered day-to-day business operations. Despite this, data scientists, analysts, and data engineers were constantly dealing with data quality, data governance, and change management issues stemming from issues with upstream source data.\n\nAfter spending time talking to dozens of data teams, the trio realized that the data industry’s approach to managing data at the source was 15 years behind software engineering. Data contracts, integration testing, unit testing, diffs, and monitoring were all sorely lacking outside the Data Warehouse. This caused data quality issues to cascade from upstream sources into the analytical environment spurring an overflow of failed tests and randomly changing data - a problem that made data products fundamentally unscalable. Shortly after, Gable was born, with the mission of creating a data culture of collaboration, accountability, quality, and governance.",
      "# [4 Best Data Producer Practices to Improve Your Data Quality](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-producers)\nData engineering teams and data producers can find it hard to collaborate within an organization for a number of reasons.\n\nPoor data quality is one of them.\n\nFor example, a customer’s address may be recorded incorrectly, which can affect their delivery. Sometimes, there are inconsistent data formats (e.g., inconsistency between two datasets). These issues can make data integration tricky and hamper data analytics. As a consequence, you risk dealing with outages and lose a lot of time that goes into fixing things.\n\nThat’s precisely why you need to gain a thorough understanding of data producers, assess their relationship with data consumers, and follow best practices for data producers to minimize data quality issues and improve your data management.\n\nWho and what are data producers?\n\nA data producer is anything that collects, processes, generates, and stores data that’s relevant to your organization and makes it available for data consumers. This can be a user interface, service, device, system—or human.\n\nData producers serve a key role in data lifecycle as the main source of truth. This information is fed into analysis and decision-making processes. Since data producers often generate unstructured data or raw data, it needs to undergo further processing in order to derive meaningful insights from it.\n\nFor example, a point-of-sale (PoS) system is a data producer for a retail company. It generates raw data in the form of sales transaction records, including customer information, product ID, and purchase details. You can perform processing and analysis on this data via customer segmentation or sales trend analysis to understand consumer buying behavior.\n\nSoftware engineers, on the other hand, are also data producers because they develop and maintain systems and applications that generate large amounts of data. They create transactional databases, message queues like Kafka topics, and other tools that produce data.\n\nData producers vs. data consumers\n\nWhile data producers generate data, a data consumer is an entity that uses it. Data consumers copy this data, perform data transformations on it, or send it to other systems. Some examples of data consumers include marketing automation platforms, BI platforms, data analysts, and data scientists. In the case of data analysts, Python, SQL, and other tools can analyze, transform, or visualize data.\n\nTechnical overview of data producers\n\nConsider an ecommerce website that uses a database to store product information, customer profiles, and transaction records. The website's API serves as the intermediary, enabling seamless communication between the database and the front-end interface. The website provides users with a user-friendly interface to browse products, add items to their cart, and complete purchases.\n\nWhen it comes to data producers, your data follows a unidirectional path. In other words, data only flows upstream or downstream at any given time. In this example, the data follows a unidirectional flow, starting from the database, where product information and customer details are stored. The API then processes this data and delivers it to the front-end interface, allowing users to view product listings, add items to their cart, and make purchases. User interactions with the front-end interface, such as selecting products and completing payments, are returned to the API and then stored in the database.\n\nWhat you should keep in mind is that a data producer can function as a data consumer in a different context. The database functions as the data producer when it generates and stores data for the website. The API is the data consumer when it retrieves the data from the database.\n\nHowever, the API becomes the data producer when the front-end interface (acting as a data consumer) calls it to retrieve data. Similarly, the front-end interface can become a data producer for the customer who is now the data consumer that goes through the information provided on the website.\n\nData producer examples\n\nData producers can consist of any of the following:\n\nSoftware engineers act as data producers when they develop applications or systems that generate data during user interactions.\n\nSales associates contribute as data producers when they record customer interactions and sales transactions into company systems. The data they generate helps to improve customer relationship management and boost sales.\n\nCustomers become data producers by interacting with the company’s platforms via online purchases and social media engagement. Their activities generate valuable data on user preferences, behaviors, and feedback. This data helps to analyze and improve customer experience in the future.\n\nBest practices for data producers\n\nStruggling to maintain standardized data formats and failing to streamline data integration can leave your organization behind the curve and impact your decision-making processes. Data engineering managers should consider the following best practices for data producers to improve data management within their organization.\n\n1. Understand your data sources\n\nYou need to understand your data sources when it comes to data producers. When you assess how the data was created and its context, you can identify potential inaccuracies, biases, or limitations.\n\nFor instance, an automated employee attendance tracking system is a data producer. The system serves as the data producer by generating and recording employee attendance data. Understanding the data source—in this case, a biometric attendance system—allows the office management to identify any potential inaccuracies or limitations. They might recognize that the system may not be able to capture nuanced attendance details, such as the reasons for late arrivals. By reviewing these limitations, office management can implement relevant initiatives such as periodic manual checks to provide more accurate information for data producers.\n\n2. Introduce metadata management\n\nMetadata management provides context and information about the data. It helps data producers understand the structure, meaning, and relationships within a dataset. For instance, data producers, such as customer service agents, need to know how the customer data is organized with the CRM system.\n\nMetadata management includes documenting and categorizing different data types within the CRM system via a data catalog. This can help agents understand whether the data is numerical, textual, or categorical. They can also learn about relationships between different data entities. For example, it can uncover how customer data is linked to past purchases or interactions.\n\n3. Implement data quality assurance\n\nData quality assurance is an ongoing process to ensure data is accurate, reliable, consistent, and relevant. It includes using a wide range of techniques and practices to maintain and improve the quality of data that producers generate. This process involves validating data at the point of entry, identifying and resolving errors within it, and ensuring it remains consistent across different systems throughout the organization.\n\nConsider a financial firm where a transaction monitoring system serves as a data producer. The system generates data on customer transactions, account activities, and financial operations. Implementing data quality assurance in this context includes validating how accurate the transaction data is, ensuring data is standardized and consistent across different accounts, and detecting any potential fraudulent activities. This can be done through real-time transaction monitoring, anomaly detection algorithms, and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance checks.\n\n4. Use a data collaboration management platform\n\nGartner analysts predict that by next year, 50% of businesses will embrace a modern data quality solution.\n\nAfter GitHub was launched in 2008, it quickly became a must-have tool for software development teams throughout the world for companies of all scales. GitHub helped teams to manage and track code effectively in a collaborative environment.\n\nSimilar to how GitHub was highly needed for software teams, there’s a need for a collaboration management tool for data teams. Fortunately, Gable.ai fills this vacuum. Gable.ai can bridge the gap between data producers and data consumers. By introducing data contracts and a data collaboration system, the platform can help to improve data quality, consistency, and communication.\n\nFor example, if you have an order processing system as a data producer and an inventory management system as a data consumer, Gable.ai can create data contracts for them. These contracts define specific data parameters that are required by the inventory system and ensure that the order processing system produces data according to its needs.\n\nRevolutionize the way you communicate data between your data producers and consumers",
      "# [Data Debt: What Is it and How to Avoid It](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-debt)\nAccruing data debt might be the cost of doing business in today's digital economy. But, just like its financial cousin, data debt can cost a business dearly if left unmanaged.\n\nAnd, while the monetary analogy makes for a helpful onramp, it's crucial to appreciate the unique and specific impacts data debt has on organizations. While gaining this appreciation, it's also essential to differentiate data debt from technical debt—an analog that occurs in data engineering and software departments.\n\nData debt, to begin with, refers to shortcuts and compromises made within an organization related to data quality, data architecture, and data management in an effort to accelerate access to data. As opposed to creating immediate issues, data debt accumulates over time and can create significant, long-term challenges that, ironically, \"seem to come out of nowhere.\" And, while a majority of modern business models are susceptible to these effects, data debt is particularly troublesome within organizations for whom accessible, reliable, high-quality data is mission-critical.\n\nAlternatively, for technical debt, the causal decisions often involve hardware and software-related factors. While the \"costs\" associated with correcting technical debt can impact an entire organization, the damage inherent in data debt can be far more insidious.\n\nData is increasingly—if not overwhelmingly—fueling the engines of modern business. Poor data quality, compounded by an accumulation of data debt, compromises data-driven decision-making.\n\nWhat's more, left unchecked, data issues can also lead to operational inefficiencies, hamper scalability, harm customer trust, increase security and compliance risks, and more.\n\nFor these reasons, proactively handling data debt should be considered mission-critical. And the ability to do so hinges on helping stakeholders appreciate the multitude of ways data debt can damage an organization.\n\n13 symptoms that may mean data debt is sinking the ship\n\nIntegration issues: When a company moves to adopt new tools or systems, data debt begins to complicate the integration process, leading to delays, complexity, and errors. This same situation can occur when two companies merge and are forced to reconcile two drastically different data systems.\n\nProject delays: Projects in highly data-dependent departments (e.g., IT and product development) may be the first to slow down, be put on hold, or begin going over budget as teams increasingly deal with inconsistencies or proper data hygiene.\n\nSystem degradation: Data debt can begin to compound data integrity, creating malfunctions, service errors and outages, or even complete system failures.\n\nPoor decision-making: It’s admirable when an organization’s leadership tries to use data to make better decisions. But data debt can begin empowering sub-optimal strategies and actions that cause more harm than good. In this sense, no data truly is better than bad data.\n\nMissed opportunities: As data grows untrustworthy or begins to lag behind real time, leadership will also struggle to capitalize on market trends, competitive intel, or the evolving needs of their own customers.\n\nReduced productivity: Employees who end up (re)cleaning, transforming, and validating data are spending less time on their own tasks. As data debt snowballs, inefficiencies and lessening throughput do as well.\n\nIncreasing operational costs: The constant rework needed to counteract an organization’s growing debt begins increasing direct costs like bringing in more resources to help, and indirect costs related to lost time and effort.\n\nSecurity vulnerabilities: Data debt can begin to erode overall security, leading to lax user access management, inadequate encryption, or outdated data storage protocols that begin exposing the organization to unacceptable amounts of risk.\n\nRegulatory and legal issues: Common debt contributors make it exceptionally difficult to handle user data with the same level of integrity and transparency once limited to a few specific industries, like finance and health care. But, while the scope of who needs to clear regulatory bars has changed, the consequences of failing to do so haven’t, often resulting in severe penalties and/or fines.\n\nDecreasing employee morale: We’ve touched on impacts ranging from projects and processes to workflows and costs. Unfortunately, data debt can also announce itself through the toll it takes on employee wellbeing. Frustration builds as day-to-day employees continually deal with data-related fire drills, leading to low morale and updated LinkedIn accounts.\n\nDissatisfied customers: Ongoing data issues eventually leech out through the walls of the organization as billing mishaps, ineffective customer support, misleading product recommendations, and poor customer experience begin frustrating customers.\n\nBrand reputation damage: The same data quality issues that begin to eat away at customer satisfaction can also harm an organization’s reputation within its industry. This, in turn, puts the screws to customer acquisition and retention.\n\nDulling competitive edge: Companies that manage data effectively generate insights faster, utilize them better, respond to market changes quicker, and not only innovate but do so more rapidly. For organizations drowning in data debt, the exact opposite holds true. And it’s these organizations that, sooner or later, find themselves losing step with competitors.\n\nBest practices for managing data debt\n\nFortunately, despite all the factors that can contribute to data debt within an organization, there is an array of best practices that business leaders can champion to counteract debt’s ability to accrue. Broadly, these best practices can be lumped into three categories: procedural, technological, and cultural. Or, as it’s commonly known in reference to digital transformation, “people, processes, and technologies.”\n\nProcedural best practices\n\nThese best practices begin and end with instituting and supporting a robust data governance framework. To counteract data debt, this framework needs to clearly outline all methodologies, use cases, procedures, and policies related to the data lifecycle.\n\nThe governance framework should be employee-accessible, ensuring individuals at all levels of the organization understand data standards and how they can avoid contributing to poor-quality data. These efforts should also include training and workshops, so the entire organization gets on (and stays on) the same page regarding data management best practices.\n\nAs you develop your governance framework, put a system in place for documenting how data is collected, processed, and stored. Plan to use this system as a foundation for clear data lineage procedures in order to benefit from the ability to trace and map data’s unique journey throughout your organization.\n\nProcedures also need to account for data retention policies, outlining where data should be retained, for how long, and whether it should eventually be archived or deleted entirely. Audit processes should then be put in place so that data is regularly reviewed for consistency, accuracy, and relevance.\n\nTechnological best practices\n\nNext, turn your attention to tools and technology that actively work against data debt. Ideally, this begins by modernizing your data infrastructure. Data should be migrated carefully from any legacy systems to more agile, efficient, and scalable systems. And cloud-based solutions continue to make this increasingly easy to implement.\n\nConsider introducing data integration platforms to keep the merging, cleaning, and integration of data from different sources streamlined over time. Metadata management systems make it easier to manage, store, and access valuable context about data as it flows into, and through, your organization. Use data quality tools and automated data validation so that new data is validated against a specific set of standards, and corrected automatically when those standards aren’t met.\n\nAnd while access to data documentation and context should be widely available, access to the data itself shouldn’t be. By implementing access control tools you can dial in user permissions, ensuring only specified individuals can access and modify data.\n\nCultural best practices\n\nWith proper processes and technologies in place, you must absolutely address the human element inherent in an organization’s data debt.\n\nStart with buy-in from leadership because data quality is everyone’s responsibility. Without executives and stakeholders making this clear, data quality within an organization will rot from the roots up—diligent, day-to-day processes ultimately keep organizational data aligned with the truth. It’s important, then, to ensure top management commits and is ready to take accountability for their organization’s data debt. Leadership will also need to ensure best practices are funded and adopted.\n\nWith leadership behind these efforts, a culture of data ownership can actually be fostered. As employees begin to benefit from data debt mitigation, it will be easier for peers to hold each other accountable for good data management and contributing to data quality.\n\nAs this sense of ownership takes hold, encourage a collaborative environment where departments work together on data projects, as this requires unified standards, promotes data literacy, and breaks down silos.\n\nKeep communication channels open so that your increasingly empowered employees can easily suggest improvements and report data issues as they arise. Comparing and contrasting feedback from different departments can uncover valuable insights. And, finally, actively reward data hygiene.\n\nA natural by-product of these best practices is that the idea of data quality and data debt will become much more tangible. Reinforce this tangibility by recognizing and rewarding teams and individuals who maintain the highest standards of data quality and management.\n\nData contracts: 10 ways better data agreements and specifications are paving a data debt-free future\n\nData contracts can play a pivotal role in minimizing or mitigating data debt. At its core, a data contract is a formal agreement or specification that outlines the format, structure, and semantics of data. They are particularly important when different systems or services interact with one another, ensuring a standardized and expected format of data exchange. Here's how they can help:\n\nStandardization: Data contracts ensure a consistent structure, which means that data from different sources or teams adheres to a unified format. This reduces discrepancies and inconsistencies, a common form of data debt.\n\nValidation: Data contracts can be used as a validation mechanism, ensuring that incoming or outgoing data meets specific criteria or standards before processing. This can prevent inaccurate or corrupt data from entering the system.\n\nDocumentation: A well-defined data contract serves as a form of documentation that’s version controlled, clarifying how data should be structured, what each attribute means, and any constraints on the data. This reduces the chances of misunderstandings or misinterpretations.\n\nInteroperability: As organizations grow, they may integrate multiple systems, tools, or external services. Data contracts ensure seamless integration by setting clear expectations about how data should be sent and received between systems.\n\nReduction in ambiguity: With clear data contracts, there's less guesswork or ambiguity involved in how data should be managed or understood, reducing the risk of errors.\n\nEasier troubleshooting: When issues arise, having a data contract in place makes it easier to pinpoint deviations from the expected data format, speeding up troubleshooting and resolution processes. Contracts also ensure that the correct data owners are contacted based on the specific issues at hand.\n\nSupport for evolution: As data needs change, data contracts can be versioned, allowing for organized transitions and updates. This ensures that even as changes occur, there's a clear record of different data formats and structures over time.\n\nEfficiency in collaboration: When different teams or departments collaborate, having clear data contracts reduces friction and misunderstandings. Everyone knows what to expect, ensuring smoother collaboration.\n\nTransparency and trust: For consumers of the data (which might be internal teams or external partners), a clear contract gives confidence in the data's consistency and quality, fostering trust.\n\nEnhanced compliance: For industries with stringent regulatory requirements around data, having clear data contracts can assist in ensuring compliance by setting and following clear data standards.\n\nTo harness these benefits, it's essential to ensure that data contracts are kept up-to-date, widely accessible to relevant stakeholders, and strictly enforced.\n\nAnd that’s the core principle Gable was designed to address. Join our beta waiting list to be one of the first in your field to learn how data contracts are foundational aspects of a strong data strategy, effectively curbing the accrual of data debt.\n\n‍",

Due to the technical and business practices that were predominant at the end of the 21st century, data modeling at its zenith placed a strong emphasis on structured, well-defined models.\n\nHowever, in the late 2000s, the emergence of major cloud service providers like Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) enabled cloud computing to gain traction within business organizations.\n\nBy the end of that same decade, the benefits of scaleable, on-demand computing resources led to a proper surge within business organizations, which then led to the proliferation of what is now commonly referred to as the modern data stack—a group of cloud-based tools and technologies used for the collection, storage, processing, and analysis of data.\n\nCompared to the at-the-push-of-a-button benefits available on demand, data modeling was then seen by a growing number of practitioners as rigid and inflexible. Data modeling takes time. It can get complicated. The costs and overheads associated with the process reflected this. Perhaps most damaging at the time, it became easy to frame data modeling as a bottleneck—dead weight hampering the speed and flexibility of modern data management.\n\nHowever, this overemphasis on speed and flexibility and the underutilization of data modeling wasn’t sustainable. Though there is no specific “breaking point” to point to, by the mid-2010s, these issues became increasingly attributable to data modeling’s diminution.\n\nWhile far from exhaustive, increasingly common factors helped to precipitate this recalibration in the data space:\n\nData governance challenges: The abundance of cloud-based data storage and processing fueled an explosive increase in the data sources and repositories the average organization had access to. This sudden abundance, in turn, intensified the maintenance of data quality, security, and compliance, irreparably complicating the governance process.\n\nData quality issues: The fevered rate at which cloud-based solutions were adopted resulted in the neglect of data modeling and proper data architecture, resulting in inconsistencies, data quality issues, and difficulties in data integration.\n\nLack of standardization: While cloud environments freed teams to use various tools and platforms, the consistency of data management practices degraded, making it harder to ensure consistency and interoperability across an organization.\n\nScalability and performance issues: Without proper data modeling, it became difficult to optimize systems for performance and scalability. Bottlenecks and reduced system efficiency resulted as data volumes grew.\n\nSecurity and compliance risks: Rapid cloud adoption without adequate attention to data modeling and architecture can expose organizations to security vulnerabilities and compliance risks, especially when dealing with sensitive or regulated data.\n\nDifficulties in extracting value from data: Without a well-thought-out data model, organizations struggle to extract meaningful insights from data. Inevitably, these organizations found that simply having data in the cloud did not guarantee it was inherently usable or valuable for decision-making.\n\n2. Data modeling defined\n\nData modeling is the practice or process of creating a conceptual representation of data objects and the relation between them. Data modeling is comparable to architecture, in that the process blueprints how data is stored, managed, and used within and between systems and databases.\n\nIn essence, there are three key components of data modeling:\n\nEntities: Entities represent the real-world objects or concepts an organization wants to understand better. Examples of data modeling entities include products, employees, and customers.\n\nAttributes: These are the characteristics or properties of the entities being modeled. Attributes provide details that are used to describe and distinguish instances of an entity—product names, prices, customer names, phone numbers, etc.\n\nRelationships: The connections between entities in a data model are called relationships. They can be one-to-one, many-to-many, or one-to-many. Each entity is represented in a relational database in the typical data modeling process. While each entity has a unique identity, it can have multiple instances.\n\nTraditionally, the role of data modeling primarily focused on designing databases for transactional systems and normalizing data to reduce redundancy, improving database performance. The process itself mainly involved working with structured data in relational databases.\n\nModern data modeling is highly varied by comparison. And while its practice and process have evolved beyond some of its inherent qualities viewed negatively in the past, others are now increasingly accepted as trade-offs to be balanced against.\n\nData modeling today caters to a wide range of data storage and processing systems, ranging from traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS) to data lakes and NoSQL databases. Data models now facilitate data integration. They can support advanced analytics, data science initiatives, and predictive modeling. Modern models emphasize agility and scalability to quickly adapt to shifting business requirements.\n\nAs such, data modeling now also supports efforts in the data space to democratize data, helping to make data more understandable and accessible to a wide range of users.\n\n3. Common types of data models\n\nThere are four main types of data models, conceptual, logical, physical, and dimensional. This is true when the goal is to simplify the categorization of data models.\n\nDepending on the business needs of an organization, however, more than these initial four may be considered and utilized. We note the former simply because of the confusion this can sometimes cause within the data space.\n\nConceptual data models\n\nThe purpose of conceptual data models is to establish a macro, business-focused view of an organization’s data structure. Conceptual models are often leveraged in the planning phase of database design or a database management system.\n\nIn these cases, a data architect or modeler may work with business stakeholders and analysts to identify relevant entities, attributes, and relationships using unified modeling language (UML) and entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs).\n\nLogical data modeling\n\nLogical data models work to provide a detailed view of organizational data that is independent of specific technologies and physical considerations. By doing so, logical models are free to focus on capturing business requirements and rules without being biased by technical constraints. As a result, they can provide a clearer understanding of data from a business perspective.\n\nThe ability of less technical stakeholders to more easily understand logical data models also makes them a particularly useful tool for communicating with technical teams.\n\nPhysical data modeling\n\nAlternately, physical data modeling aims to capture and represent the detailed structure and design of a database, taking into account the specific features and constraints of a chosen database management system (DBMS), as well as business requirements for performance, access methods, and storage.\n\nFor this reason, the entities database administrators and developers will focus on include physical aspects of a database—indexes, keys, partitioning, stored procedures and triggers, etc.\n\nDimensional data modeling\n\nFor business intelligence and data warehousing applications, dimensional data modeling is often used. This is because a dimensional model employs an efficient, user-friendly, flexible structure that organizes data into fact tables and dimensions to support fast querying and reporting.\n\nDue to this, dimensional data models can specifically support related applications' complex queries, analysis, and reporting needs.\n\nObject-oriented data modeling\n\nBased on the principles of object-oriented programming, object-oriented data modeling represents data as objects instead of entities. The objects in this type of data modeling encapsulate both data and behavior. This object-oriented approach is key, making object-oriented models highly useful in scenarios where data structures must reflect real-world objects and their relationships.\n\nCommon examples of these scenarios include ecommerce and inventory management systems, banking and financial systems, customer relationship management (CMS) systems, and educational software.\n\nData vault modeling\n\nAs the word “vault” implies, data vault modeling is used in data warehousing, but also in business intelligence. Both data warehousing and BI projects benefit from the historical data preservation, scalability, flexibility, and integration capabilities that data vault models provide.\n\nIn theory, this makes data modeling a potential tool for any organization that needs to integrate data from multiple sources while maintaining data history and lineage (e.g., healthcare organizations, government agencies, and manufacturing companies).\n\nNormalized data modeling\n\nThis type of data modeling focuses on two things—reducing data redundancy and improving data integrity. This can be crucial for transactional systems where data integrity and consistency are of prime importance. Normalized models are easier to maintain and update, while they also prevent data anomalies like inconsistencies and duplication.\n\nDe-normalized data modeling\n\nAlternately, de-normalized data models involve the intentional introduction of redundancies into a dataset in order to improve performance. Through de-normalized modeling, related data can be stored in the same table or document. This reduces the need for computationally expensive join operations, which can slow down query performance.\n\nBecause of how they function, de-normalized data models also harmonize with the principles of NoSQL databases, which prioritize flexibility, scalability, and performance.\n\n4. Causes of controversy in the data modeling space\n\nData scholars agree that discussions around data modeling function similarly to a hornet’s nest in nature—both tend to cause massive amounts of pain when stumbled into. While unfortunate for the stumbler, it helps to understand that, in both cases, damage results in the attempt to defend what one holds dear.\n\nFor hornets, driven to protect the nest’s existing and developing queens, the aggression results from a combination of their innate programming, alarm pheromones, and the instinct to attack in numbers in order to intimidate and dissuade larger foes.\n\nFor data practitioners, however, aggressively defending one’s beliefs about the process and practice of data modeling is usually motivated by one or more of the following factors:\n\nDiverse perspectives: Data modeling is a field that intersects with numerous disciplines, including data science, software engineering, database design, data analytics, and business intelligence. While sharing varying degrees of overlap, these disparate professional backgrounds act as frames through which the views of “effective data modeling” become wildly divergent in the data space.\n\nComplexity and trade-offs: Additionally, data modeling tends to involve near-endless tradeoffs between competing priorities. These tradeoffs include speed vs. governance, normalization vs. performance, and structure vs. flexibility—each with passionate advocates on both sides of the aisle.\n\nOrganizational context: The “right” data model in one organization may not be the same in another, even when operating within the same industry. Differing business rules and goals, data requirements, schema, information systems, and data maturity all but guarantee that there will never be one true data modeling technique or process.\n\nSubjectivity in design: Data modeling itself can be quite subjective. Like many design disciplines, there are often multiple ways to model a given dataset. And data modelers themselves often have legitimate reasons for championing one approach over another. This subjectivity is part of why many find the challenges of data modeling so fulfilling.\n\nEvolving technologies: Despite the order and logic practitioners attempt to bring to the table, the exponentially rapid evolution of data technologies—from traditional relational databases to NoSQL, low and no-code platforms, and big data—necessitates approaches to data modeling to continuously diversify.\n\nFluctuating best practices: Due to the ever-evolving modeling landscape, its related best practices invariably need to change. Techniques once considered sacrosanct can find themselves outdated, furthering debates about what the current best approach may be at any given time.\n\nEmotional Investment: Data practitioners tend to be curious, persistent, analytical thinkers who benefit from a high attention to detail. As such, those who practice data modeling (or cross paths with it) tend to invest a great deal of intellectual and emotional capital in their work. Occasionally, this can create an environment where critiques or suggestions for alternate approaches can either be delivered as a personal attack, or taken as such.\n\n5. Restoring the model of balance\n\nThe good news is that navigating the tension between the impact of data modeling and the convenience of the modern data stack is inevitable. Organizations helping to strike the balance should consider employing the following:\n\nAdopt a hybrid approach: Consider using structured data modeling for core business entities that require consistency and stability above all. In areas that call for more agility and flexibility, employ modern data technologies that enable rapid iteration.\n\nHarmonize flexibility with standardization: Building on a hybrid approach, look to standardize core data elements and processes. At the same time, allow for flexibility in areas where rapid change can be expected. Embrace constant balancing and rebalancing of the strengths of structured data modeling and the modern data stack.\n\nUse iterative data modeling: Instead of insisting on extensive upfront data modeling, try an iterative approach. Start with a basic model, then evolve it as needed. Iteration can produce the best of both worlds, maintaining a structured approach while responding to requirements as they change over time.\n\nLeverage data virtualization: Data visualization provides a helpful layer of abstraction that allows for integrating diverse data sources without extensive modeling. In some organizations, this approach maintains agility while ensuring data is effectively understood and used.\n\nFocus on metadata management: Bridging the gap between structure modeling and agility usually involves a (sometimes renewed) focus on effective metadata management. Robust metadata curation further enables organizational flexibility while clarity regarding data structures and relationships is maintained.\n\nEmphasize data governance: When individuals are empowered to enact consistent data governance, clear policies and standards guiding data quality, usage, and security help ensure a data environment remains as agile as possible.\n\nEnable self-service data access: When implemented with appropriate controls, self-service data access supports agility by allowing users to access data as needed while still operating within the framework of the established data model.\n\nContinuous collaboration: Make sure to foster continuous collaboration between your data architects, engineers, and business users. While the passionate data modeling discussions will still take place from time to time, making cross-disciplinary collaboration an important part of the culture helps keep modeling efforts and business needs aligned.\n\nImplement data contracts: Finally, employ data contracts to provide structured agreements on data formats and interfaces. Their ability to foster communication between data producers and consumers promotes balance just as the other tactics here do—but also allows that balance to scale.\n\n6. Suggested next steps\n\nAs is now abundantly clear, treating data as a product is paramount for any organization looking to succeed in an overwhelmingly data-dependent world. Data contracts are the best way to guarantee the quality of data before it even enters an organization.",
      "# [What is Data Testing? Types, Use Cases, Examples](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-testing)\nData testing isn’t new. However, it is taking on newfound urgency as major trends involving artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, cloud computing, edge computing, and DataOps drive a surge in organizational data consumption.\n\nThis mirrors how trends in global food production led to the rise and prominence of food testing and safety protocols. As our food supply becomes increasingly globalized, tracking, quality assurance, and transparency are paramount. Similarly, in the digital realm, as data is sourced and integrated from diverse global sources, ensuring its quality, reliability, and transparency through rigorous testing becomes crucial.\n\nDoing so ensures that data-driven decisions are based on solid, trustworthy information, just as strict food safety protocols guarantee the food we consume is safe and of high quality.\n\nWhat is data testing?\n\nData testing is the formalized process of validating the accuracy and quality of data within a system. This makes it an increasingly important process as more organizations and industries look to data-driven decision decision-making and real-time analytics to remain competitive.\n\nThe process of testing data involves a combination of techniques and methodologies. Together, they aim to help data teams identify and solve data quality issues that affect its value for data consumers and stakeholders—inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and incomplete data sets.\n\nWhile the specifics vary across organizations and industries, data testing commonly encompasses four main areas:\n\nValidation of data integration processes ensures that data from different sources is accurately merged and transformed.\n\nPerformance testing of databases and data processing applications ensures they meet the required speed, efficiency, and scalability.\n\nSecurity testing safeguards data integrity and privacy, which is especially critical in the context of regulations like GDPR and CCPA.\n\nCompliance testing verifies that data handling practices adhere to relevant legal and industry standards.\n\nDoes all data need to be tested?\n\nData quality is imperative for data-driven organizations. Therefore, data testing in some form or another is now essential. Without it, data teams and consumers within the organization would roll the dice regarding the integrity, accuracy, and reliability of the data pouring into and through the business.\n\nMore specifically, there are 10 key reasons why data testing is essential:\n\nEnsuring data quality: Data testing verifies that the data obtained is correct, complete, and consistent, which is vital for maintaining high data quality standards. High-quality data is essential for accurate analytics and decision-making.\n\nIdentifying coding errors: By testing data, organizations can identify coding errors early in the development process, which saves time and reduces costs associated with fixing issues later on.\n\nSupporting regulatory compliance: Data testing ensures that data management practices comply with relevant standards and regulations, such as GDPR and HIPAA, protecting sensitive information and avoiding legal penalties.\n\nImproving user satisfaction: Accurate and reliable data testing leads to the development of applications that are dependable and of high quality, resulting in increased user satisfaction and trust in the company.\n\nReducing costs: Identifying bugs early through data testing is significantly cheaper than fixing issues discovered after a product release. This represents potential savings for companies and contributes to a better user experience.\n\nFacilitating better decision-making: Reliable data testing ensures that the data used for analytics and informing business strategy is accurate, which is crucial for making informed business decisions.\n\nEnhancing efficiency: By identifying and addressing issues with systems that store and analyze data, data testing improves the efficiency of these systems and processes, leading to better productivity and cost savings.\n\nProtecting data privacy: Data testing plays a crucial role in ensuring data privacy and security by identifying potential vulnerabilities and ensuring that sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access or breaches.\n\nReducing data-related defects: Accurate test data reduces the number of data-related defects or false positives, thereby increasing the efficiency of the testing process.\n\nSupporting Agile and DevOps practices: Proper test data management and testing are essential for supporting modern software development practices like Agile and DevOps, which require regular integration and continuous testing.\n\nHow to determine what you should test\n\nDetermining which data you should test involves a series of steps and considerations to ensure that the test data is representative, relevant, and comprehensive enough to validate the software application effectively. Here are the key steps and best practices for determining the test data:\n\n1. Define clear test data requirements\n\nBefore creating or acquiring test data, it's essential to define the test data requirements that match the scope, objectives, and scenarios of your testing activities. This includes specifying the type, volume, format, and quality of the data needed to test the software effectively.\n\n2. Understand the application's data dependencies\n\nAnalyze the application’s data dependencies, data types, and data sources to select the most appropriate test data. This involves understanding the features, functions, requirements, risks, and assumptions of the software under test.\n\n3. Use activity diagrams to understand code performance\n\nFor Agile practices, activity diagrams are crucial to understanding what specific function a new modification or new piece of code is going to perform. Then, define data to support that use case or set of scenarios.\n\n4. Design a strong data discovery process\n\nA robust data discovery process involves identifying and understanding the data requirements for each test scenario. Proper data discovery helps in selecting the most appropriate test data and ensures that the test environments closely resemble real-world scenarios.\n\n5. Refresh test data regularly\n\nRegularly refreshing test data is essential to maintaining data accuracy and relevance. Outdated or stale data can lead to invalid test results and hinder the identification of critical defects.\n\n6. Employ automation where possible\n\nAutomating Test Data Management tasks can significantly improve efficiency and reduce the risk of errors. Automation tools generate test data, refresh test environments, and anonymize data quickly, enabling testing teams to focus on the actual testing process.\n\n7. Create a review and auditing process\n\nEstablishing a review and auditing process ensures that the test data is accurate, reliable, and complies with data privacy regulations. Regular reviews by designated stakeholders, along with internal audits, help identify any anomalies or data quality issues.\n\n8. Maintain data security\n\nEnsuring that sensitive and confidential data is protected requires implementing data masking, encryption, and access controls. This ensures that only authorized personnel can access and use sensitive data during testing.\n\n9. Manage test data via business entities\n\nInstead of working to understand the complexities of source systems, databases, tables, and columns, testing teams should be able to simply define the business entities for which they need test data.\n\n10. Extract on the fly\n\nEnable the tester, or test data automation tool, to request the data needed to perform a given test, in flight, without any preparation.\n\nData testing methods: When to use each\n\nData testing is a crucial aspect of ensuring data quality and integrity in various applications and systems. Different data testing methods are designed to address specific aspects of data quality and system functionality.\n\nHere's an overview of various data testing methods and the appropriate contexts for their use:\n\nData completeness testing\n\nData completeness testing verifies that all expected data is present and that there are no missing values or records. This method is essential when data migrates from one system to another or when integrating data from multiple sources to ensure that no data is lost in the process.\n\nData accuracy testing\n\nData accuracy testing involves verifying that the data in the system is correct and accurately represents the real-world entities or transactions it is supposed to model. This method is crucial for applications where data precision directly impacts decision-making, financial calculations, or any other critical business processes.\n\nData consistency testing\n\nData consistency testing checks for uniformity in data across different databases, systems, or data stores. It is particularly important in distributed systems or environments where data is replicated across multiple locations to ensure that all copies of the data remain consistent over time.\n\nData integrity testing\n\nData integrity testing ensures that the data remains accurate and consistent as it undergoes operations such as transfer, retrieval, and storage. This method is vital for systems that involve complex transactions or operations that modify the data, ensuring that data relationships and constraints are maintained.\n\nData validation testing\n\nData validation testing verifies that the data meets specific criteria or constraints, such as data types, ranges, and formats. This method is used in scenarios where data is inputted into the system through forms or APIs to ensure that only valid data is accepted and stored.\n\nData transformation testing\n\nData transformation testing involves verifying that data transformation operations, such as aggregations, conversions, and calculations, are performed correctly. This method is crucial in data warehousing and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes where data is transformed before being loaded into the target system.\n\nData migration testing\n\nData migration testing is conducted to ensure that data is accurately migrated from one system to another without loss, corruption, or alteration. This method is essential during system upgrades, platform changes, or when consolidating data from multiple sources into a single repository.\n\nPerformance testing for Big Data\n\nPerformance testing for Big Data involves assessing the system's performance, including data loading speed, data processing speed, and the performance of individual components. This method is critical for applications that process large volumes of data and require high performance to meet user expectations.\n\nRegression testing\n\nRegression testing ensures that new changes, updates, or additions to the system do not adversely affect the existing functionality, including data processing and handling capabilities. This method is used after software updates, bug fixes, or new feature implementations to ensure that the system continues to operate correctly.\n\nEach of these data testing methods addresses specific aspects of data quality and system functionality. The choice of method depends on the particular requirements of the system being tested, the nature of the data, and the specific objectives of the testing process.\n\nConsider testing the idea of data as a product\n\nData testing is a critical component of treating data as a product because it ensures the data product's quality, reliability, and usability. When data is treated as a product, it is developed, managed, and delivered with a high level of care and attention, akin to any other product offering.\n\nThus, our analogy with food isn’t merely playful. We are increasingly recognizing the problems created by prioritizing the availability of food over its quality, and, by extension, its lasting impact on our health.\n\nAs increasingly complex organisms in a digital ecosystem, this helps explain why the movement to treat data as a product is gaining momentum. Competitive advantages are increasingly reliant on the implementation of new tools, data contracts, and other digital transformation initiatives that drive holistic and sustainable data-driven decision-making.\n\nThat said, are you hungry to learn more?

      "# [Data SLAs: Importance, Challenges, and Best Practices](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-sla)\nData leaders, especially those at the VP level, need to understand data service-level agreements (SLAs) like the back of their hand—because mastering these critical contracts allows them to maximize the value of their data investments. This understanding also goes a long way toward fostering trust and accountability across different teams.\n\nHowever, while their underlying concept isn’t inherently complicated, service-level agreements at the enterprise scale can be multifaceted. This is why, from time to time, data leaders must reassess the components of an average SLA, why they matter, challenges that are common to data SLAs, and best practices that data leaders rely on to draft them efficiently and effectively.\n\nHow to define data SLAs\n\nOn a basic level, data SLAs are formal agreements between data producers (or providers) and data consumers. Often, these data providers are external, independent sources of data or vendors, while a given organization will internally house data consumers within differing teams, business units, and departments.\n\nHowever, in some businesses and industries that require a greater reliance on data for decision-making, operations, or compliance—think tech and software development, e-commerce, financial services, and large enterprises—data SLAs can function between data providers and consumers operating within the same organization.\n\nSLAs, whether data-related or not, are also wonderful in the sense that their name succinctly represents exactly what they are: documentation that outlines agreed-upon services—and levels of service—that one party is purchasing from another.\n\nAlthough SLAs drafted as vendor agreements serve as enforceable contracts, not all SLAs are legally binding. For example, data leaders commonly implement internal SLAs as informal agreements instead of legally enforceable contracts.\n\nLegal or not, formal or informal, data SLAs exist to guarantee both access to data from producers and the quality of that data. As such, a data SLA will cover universal data quality metrics: data reliability, accuracy, timeliness, and consistency.\n\nStakeholders tailor data quality requirements to their specific business needs, use cases, and priorities when drafting SLAs. For instance, banks rely on real-time transaction data to detect and deter fraudulent activities.\n\nData leaders in these situations might reasonably draft a data SLA that emphasizes:\n\nTimeliness: “The provider guarantees that transaction data will be processed and made available to the fraud detection system within two seconds of the transaction occurring, excluding scheduled maintenance windows or force majeure events.”\n\nAccuracy: “The provider guarantees an accuracy rate of no less than 99.99% in transaction data, as measured by periodic audits of randomly sampled transactions.”\n\nThis makes sense because in banking, \"data quality\" means real-time availability and near-perfect accuracy, as delays or inaccuracies risk financial losses, reputational damage, or regulatory penalties.\n\nLet’s now switch to the healthcare industry, where data leaders would, of course, value timeliness and accuracy as key factors of healthcare data quality. But when drafting a data SLA, they might instead pay additional time and attention to outlining requirements for:\n\nCompleteness: \"Provider guarantees that critical fields in patient records—such as allergies, current medications, and medical history—will be populated for 100% of patients where such information is available.”\n\nTimeliness: “Updates to patient records—such as new test results or medication changes—are guaranteed to be reflected in the EHR system within five minutes of entry by healthcare staff under normal operating conditions.”\n\nHere, our theoretical data leader emphasizes completeness and timeliness—and rightly so. Incomplete or delayed information could directly jeopardize patient safety and outcomes.\n\nRegardless of industry, data leaders can formalize these agreements through data SLAs to ensure that both providers and consumers understand their roles, responsibilities, and limitations in maintaining reliable and actionable data pipelines.\n\nAs a result, a well-drafted data SLA will increase an organization’s trust in the data they use, hold teams accountable for meeting agreed-upon standards, and set clear expectations that lower data-related risks over time.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean SLAs don’t come with their own set of issues. For those at the leadership level on data teams, it’s wise to pay attention to a few in particular.\n\nCommon (yet critical) data SLA challenges for data leaders\n\nAgreements tend to be easy—until people get involved, that is. Even the simplest SLA can (and usually does) create at least a few issues that data leaders need to handle.\n\nThat said, not all challenges are equally problematic, which is why it’s wise to focus on those that are most common and critical to drafting and implementing data SLAs in most organizations.\n\nAligning realistic performance metrics with business KPIs\n\nWhen data leaders engage service providers, they typically start by addressing key concerns: acceptable downtime (if any), response times for business needs, and data quality issues.\n\nBut data performance metrics represent only half the equation. Data leaders must also ensure that data outlined in the SLA actively supports their organization’s key performance indicators (KPIs).\n\nFailure to solve for all sides here can set data teams up for failure and cause them to overpromise and underdeliver, which leads to SLA breaches and eroded trust. Misaligned metrics also waste resources and force teams to focus on irrelevant or impractical goals. The devil can certainly be in the lack of detail here, as ambiguous definitions such as “timely data” or “high accuracy”) can lead to disputes about compliance.\n\nMaintaining robust communication between teams\n\nPoor or absent communication between data producers, whether they’re external vendors or internal data engineering teams, and data consumers often leads to misaligned expectations regarding SLA deliverables. Technical jargon, unclear documentation, and siloed workflows often exacerbate communication issues.\n\nIn the short term, misunderstandings like these about SLA terms or metrics can lead to disputes over compliance. However, when left to fester, poor SLA-related communication can result in unmet expectations, wasted resources, and strained relationships between teams.\n\nSupporting post-SLA monitoring and compliance\n\nTeams must monitor SLA performance to ensure adherence to agreed-upon standards. Despite near-universal data governance needs, organizations may lack real-time monitoring tools and instead rely on fragmented systems, which obscure SLA compliance.\n\nAs a result, alert fatigue can desensitize teams to critical issues, delay responses, and increase the risk of SLA breaches. Furthermore, weak monitoring strategies often force teams to identify issues only after they’ve disrupted operations or affected stakeholders.\n\nWhile these three SLA-related challenges aren’t inherently complex, data leaders must not underestimate their impact on data teams’ ability to maintain high data quality. Fortunately, following fundamental best practices allows teams to reduce—or even eliminate—these challenges.\n\n7 best practices for effective data SLAs\n\nThese following best practices, though not exhaustive, provide data teams with a solid operational foundation to build on. Each is specific enough to be actionable yet broad enough to be applicable across industries and organizations.\n\n1. Gain key buy-in and champion cross-functional collaboration\n\nInvolve stakeholders from all relevant teams—data engineering, IT, business units, and leadership—as early in the SLA drafting process as possible. This ensures the agreement gains the backing of key decision-makers during the decision-making process. These efforts also ensure the data SLA itself will reflect the diverse perspectives and operational realities of the organization.\n\n2. Keep SLAs in lockstep with business objectives\n\nInformation, insights, and perspectives gained can then ensure data SLAs are drafted in harmony with business objectives, as every SLA should—full-stop. This ensures that the data quality metrics and performance standards defined in the SLA are not arbitrary but instead contribute to measurable business outcomes, such as improving decision-making, customer satisfaction, or regulatory compliance.\n\n3. Define clear, measurable metrics based on those business objectives\n\nClearly articulate key metrics—such as accuracy, timeliness, completeness, and availability—that are specific, measurable, and enforceable. Avoid vague terms like “high-quality data” without defining what that means in quantifiable terms. In most cases, leveraging the SMART Goal methodology will be more than sufficient.\n\n4. Outline specific, realistic expectations\n\nEnsure SLA targets are ambitious yet achievable based on historical performance and current technological capabilities. Unrealistic targets frequently lead to SLA breaches and erode trust between data providers and consumers.\n\nFor help in doing so, analyze past performance data to set achievable benchmarks. For instance, if data pipelines historically operate with 99% uptime, setting a 99.5% target may encourage improvement without overpromising.\n\n5. Implement robust monitoring and reporting\n\nEstablish systems to continuously monitor SLA performance in real time and provide transparent reporting to stakeholders. This includes tracking key metrics like latency or accuracy and generating alerts for potential breaches.\n\nIdeally, use observability tools that integrate with your data pipelines to automate monitoring and generate actionable insights. For example, dashboards showing uptime percentages or error rates can help teams proactively address issues before they escalate.\n\n6. Include flexibility clauses\n\nData SLAs should account for evolving business needs or unforeseen events (e.g., system upgrades or security breaches). Use flexibility clauses to periodically review and adjust the SLA, keeping it relevant over time.\n\nThis can prove crucial, as the data needs of businesses that grow rapidly or adopt new technologies may change substantively. Regularly revisiting SLAs ensures they continue to align with organizational priorities.\n\n7. Establish consequences for non-compliance\n\nFinally, define crystal-clear consequences for failing to meet SLA commitments while ensuring they are fair and constructive. This could include financial penalties for external vendors or escalation protocols for internal teams.\n\nTo help, look to balance accountability with collaboration by focusing on remediation rather than punishment. For example, an internal SLA might require immediate escalation of unresolved issues to leadership rather than imposing penalties.\n\nTaken together, these practices ensure that data SLAs are not just static documents but dynamic tools that foster accountability, improve communication between teams, and drive continuous improvement in data quality and reliability across the organization. They also contribute to a data-centric culture where shifting data left becomes an ever-greater way of getting things right.\n\nService-level agreements as part of data-centric cultures: Building on better data quality practices\n\nIn data-driven organizations, no individual operates in isolation. Yet when it comes to data SLAs, the success of everyone—from the C-suite and stakeholders to data teams and consumers—can rest on a single set of shoulders.\n\nThat’s why those overseeing data quality management must focus upstream to address issues at their source, ensuring that higher-quality data flows freely throughout the organization’s life cycle. Implementing better, more comprehensive SLAs is a strong first step—but the journey shouldn’t end there.",
      "# [What Are Data Contracts? What Leaders Need to Know](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-contracts)\nFounding Father Benjamin Franklin knew a few things about a few things. However, what he couldn’t know is how much one of those things relates to the use of data in our modern age—that it’s far easier to prevent a fire than it is to put one out.\n\nThis insight, the basis of the proverb “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,” came from Franklin’s work to counsel city leaders in 18th-century Philadelphia, helping them deal with particularly hazardous urban fires.\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause Franklin knew what the stakes were. He’d witnessed firsthand how panic and disorganization prevented any response to a blaze from being efficient, coordinated, and effective. And he realized that, when everything around you is on fire, success at best can only be less of a failure.\n\nSo it goes with data, especially with the sheer impact it has on modern business, society, and well, life in general. But here, in our more modern world, Franklin’s favoring ounces over pounds relates squarely to data contracts and the role they play in preventing our need for high-quality data from erupting into flames.\n\nThat said, as vital a role as they’re already playing, data contracts are a newer concept to many, even unheard of by some. So let this article serve as our proverbial Bucket Brigade, raising awareness of the value of data contracts by defining exactly what they are, how they work, and valuable ways they can be used.\n\nWhat is a data contract?\n\nA data contract is a formal agreement between two or more parties that outlines specific terms and conditions of data sharing. These contracts can exist between organizations, systems, or individuals.\n\nWhere traditional contracts exist as written or spoken agreements, data contracts tend to encompass a combination of documents, tools, and artifacts that provide clear specifications, assurances, and systems to monitor and manage the data exchange between parties.\n\nWe now live in a world where the amount of new data created each day, structured by complex data architecture, rests comfortably in the quintillions of bytes. In this world, where business leaders work to enable digital transformation initiatives and more data-driven decision-making, data contracts are proving to be invaluable.\n\nHow do data contacts work?\n\nIn practice, the formal agreement that data contracts represent will marshal the exchange, handling, storage, and usage of data. Contracting parties agree to ensure that any data outlined in the contract is managed accurately and securely, remaining in compliance with relevant regulations.\n\nThese agreements aren’t hypothetical. A contract only works if it can be enforced. This is why data contracts that involve software should be programmatic.\n\nOperationally, contracts will commonly include the following:\n\nSchema definitions: A data contract should explicitly define the schema, including semantics, so the structure of data is clear. As part of a contract, schema definitions may involve specifying which formats, structures (e.g., Avro or JSON), and data types will be used.\n\nValidation rules: These rules make sure all ensuing data adheres to the defined schema and will meet data quality standards the contracting parties require.\n\nAccess control: Data contracts may specify who approved data producers and data consumers will be for the duration of time specified within the contract.\n\nData flow management: Contracts typically outline how datasets should flow between specific systems like data pipelines and data ingestion processes. They may also determine how data should be managed as it moves between contracting parties, such as data engineers and software engineers.\n\nCommunication protocols: API specifications and communication protocols may also be outlined to standardize the data exchange between systems and platforms.\n\nVersioning: Data contracts implement versioning to manage changes made to the data schema. This management ensures that all changes, including breaking changes, will be handled in a way that won’t disrupt existing systems.\n\nDependency and metadata management: To make sure changes don’t negatively impact dependent systems, dependencies between different data entities may also be managed as part of a data contract. Data contracts may also dictate how metadata will be managed and exchanged between systems, ensuring data will be understandable and usable.\n\nCompliance and auditing: Data contracts will ensure that all data exchange and management adhere to legal and compliance requirements. Mechanisms for auditing and tracking data usage and changes can also be specified.\n\nError handling: Finally, as much as data contracts work to make sure things go right, they should also guide responses when things go wrong. Defining how errors and discrepancies in data will be handled ensures that any issues that arise will be logged, addressed, and communicated properly.\n\nEssential aspects of the contract drafting process\n\nHaving defined what a data contract is and what it should typically entail, we can turn to how they’re implemented.\n\nWhile implementation specifics of a data contract will certainly vary from case to case, the blend of technical, organizational, and governance practices will, more or less, consist of the following nine aspects:\n\n1. Objectives and parameters\n\nEffective data contracts begin with defining the landscape in which they’ll operate. At their most basic, these landscapes should include all relevant stakeholders and use cases to which the contract will pertain.\n\nAs part of the stakeholder identification process, it’s important to understand their needs and challenges. Use cases can contain as much or as little detail deemed necessary, but should at least include the specific data requirements of both data producers and data consumers. With this foundational information, the ideal duration of the data contract can also be outlined.\n\n2. Schema design and management\n\nNext, a clear and comprehensive scheme should be defined using formats like YAML, JSON, or Avro to detail data structure, formats, and types. However, know that the data contract does not need to describe the entire data schema. Comprehensive as it relates to data contracts refers to everything that will be useful and can be well-owned.\n\nDoing so ensures schema changes that occur over the course of the contract will not disrupt existing systems. Further, contract parties should align how metadata will be managed to ensure valuable context about data will be accurate and accessible.\n\n3. Data quality assurance\n\nValidation rules can then be established to ensure optimal data quality and consistency. Take email for instance—are we validating that information entered in an email field is actually a real address? Or are we employing value-based validation, ensuring for example that numbers added to an age field are never less than zero?\n\nData quality metrics should also be identified at this time. Doing so ensures all parties agree on how the data quality will be defined, which metrics will be monitored, and the role the data contract will play in ensuring adherence to these standards.\n\nWhile this step may seem straightforward, it shouldn’t be undervalued—especially considering the humbling costs poor data quality enacts on businesses each year.\n\n4. Technical implementation\n\nBased on the constraint, different enforcements of the contract, such as those involving SQL queries, will be needed depending on the technologies used. This makes sense as, for example, the actualities of protecting against NULLS in a database like MySQL will differ from checking value constraints in Kafka.\n\nAPI design should also be accounted for, as needed. If APIs will be used for data exchange, they should be designed to follow GraphQL or RESTful principles, as per requirements.\n\nA format like JSON or Avro will need to be chosen for appropriate data serialization. Plans to implement robust data ingestion mechanisms and data pipelines that will handle data flow also need to be outlined.\n\n5. SLA, security, and compliance\n\nSpecifics regarding data quality, latency, and availability will be clearly defined and minted in the data contract’s SLA. Any service-level agreement will also require monitoring to ensure adherence by all contracting parties. Monitoring and detection pre-deployment here is also essential for identifying any post-implementation issues proactively.\n\nSecurity factors should involve the use of access control mechanisms that will regulate who can produce and consume data. The contract should clearly establish how data management and data exchange will comply with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements. Working in parallel, outlined data governance policies can further guide data management throughout its lifecycle.\n\n6. Communication, error handling, and resolution\n\nData contracts should be authored to facilitate collaboration between data engineers, other data teams, and data consumers affected by the contract. This collaboration relies on clear lines of communication being established and maintained among stakeholders. Moreover, providing as much context as possible bi-directionally helps teams changing the contract understand why constraints are needed while keeping consumers aware of how and when updates are being made.\n\nCommunication is key for managing expectations and providing the right updates at the right time throughout the course of the contract. That said, a data contract should at least include the basics of how productive lines of communication will be established and maintained—and who is responsible for doing so. Error logging and a defined resolution workflow must be established as part of the drafting process. Contract owners should also be alerted if the contract itself is ever violated.\n\n7. Documentation and changes\n\nWhile the contract is being drafted, the formalities of robust documentation and change management must also be captured. While both are important parts of the data contract process, each is its own distinct element. They support the contract by providing clarity and the framework for managing changes and maintaining records.\n\nDocumentation during the course of the data contract should be a clear and clearly accessible chronicle of operating facets of the data contract, including schemas and workflows.\n\nChanges in the data contract or schema should be recorded separately to ensure they can be communicated to stakeholders as needed.\n\n8. Continuous improvement\n\nAs a data contract actively guides the use of data in a given situation, feedback loops need to be established with data consumers and producers. Feedback provides valuable information that can be used to continuously improve how the data contract functions.\n\nFeedback loops also enable contracting parties to adopt an iteration approach to making these improvements, gradually enhancing and refining the data contract as needs evolve.\n\n9. Technology, tooling, and testing\n\nWith the previous aspects defined, appropriate tools and technologies can be chosen to put the contract to work. Automation should be implemented if and when possible in order to streamline the data management and validation processes.\n\nOnce completed, data contracts require thorough testing to ensure they meet all requirements and handle edge cases effectively. This testing should also validate the performance of data exchange mechanisms under various loads and scenarios.\n\nThree use cases for data contracts\n\nFinally, to stitch the why of data contracts together with their respective what and hows, the following three distinct use cases illustrate their importance and application in practice.\n\nReal-time data streaming in financial services\n\nIt’s increasingly common for financial institutions to rely on real-time data streaming—essential for making instantaneous decisions related to trading, fraud detection, and customer service.\n\nBut, with stakes this high, data must be accurate, timely, and reliable. Data discrepancies or delays can cripple decision-making and lead to financial losses.\n\nIn this use case, data contracts provide the following:\n\nAccuracy: The schema that data contracts define can ensure that data is both available and guaranteed to adhere to expected formats.\n\nSLA management: The data contract will ensure that data latency remains within acceptable parameters and selected data sources will be able to provide and process data as needed.\n\nSecurity: The contract will also make sure that sensitive financial data remains secure while transmitted, and that it can only be authorized to approved entities and individuals.\n\nCollaborative data ecosystems in healthcare\n\nHealthcare ecosystems present their own substantial regulatory and privacy concerns, as stakeholders such as doctors, hospitals, insurance companies, and research institutions need to share sensitive patient data to function at their best.\n\nThe challenges here then involve not just data privacy and consistency, but also extensive interoperability required among diverse systems to ensure compliance with regulations like HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act).\n\nIn this use case, data contracts provide the following:\n\nData quality: In this case, the data contract will ensure that data shared among entities will be accurate and reliable—essential for both patient care and research.\n\nData privacy and compliance: Data contracts define how sensitive health data can be handled, which then ensures compliance with regulatory and legal requirements.\n\nInteroperability and dependency management: Data contracts ensure not only the consistency and interoperability necessary in healthcare ecosystems but can also manage dependencies between diverse systems and stakeholders.\n\nSupply chain management in retail\n\nRetailers engage with supply chains that can consist of a huge network of logistics providers, manufacturers, and suppliers. Doing so enables retailers to keep products manufactured, transported, and stocked efficiently.\n\nWith 74% of supply chain leaders reporting increasing their investment in technology and innovation in 2023, the need to guarantee traceability, transparency, and efficiency within retail supply chains increasingly hinges on the availability of consistent, high-quality data.\n\nIn this use case, data contracts provide the following:\n\nData integration: With so many players involved in even basic retail supply chains, data contracts can facilitate the integration of data across all relevant entities, ensuring data is both consistent and accessible.\n\nTransparency and traceability: Data contracts are instrumental in defining data related to product movement, timelines, and quantities. This ensures the complicated journey products take from manufacturer to retailer remains traceable and transparent.\n\nAutomation: Contracts also govern a seamless flow of data across the entire supply chain which, in turn, enables automation and real-time decision-making.\n\nWhat goes around comes around\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of data management, the age-old wisdom of thought leaders like Benjamin Franklin remains strikingly relevant. If “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,” the importance of proactive measures in data handling cannot be overstated.\n\nData contracts, as highlighted in this article, serve as that crucial ounce of prevention, safeguarding businesses from potential pitfalls and ensuring seamless data operations. As we move forward in this digital age, the value of such preventive measures only increases.",
      "# [What is Data Provenance? Importance & Challenges](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-provenance)\nThe amount of data swarming throughout our daily lives increases exponentially. For this reason, data quality is becoming a frequently discussed topic. Bring it on, we say.\n\nBut as data quality (and big data more generally) is discussed more often, it’s imperative that we all understand and employ key terms related to data management and data governance the same way.\n\nData provenance—the term, concept, and practice—should be toward the top of one’s list. For forward-thinking organizations working to improve data quality and use, the provenance of data plays a key role in ensuring the integrity, reliability, and value of all data handled.\n\nWhat is data provenance?\n\nData provenance refers to the information (often metadata) that traces the origin and movement of data throughout the data life cycle. Ideally, this information encompasses the history of specific data—where it came from, the processes and methodologies undergone since origination, and changes of ownership and structure along the way.\n\nThis information is essential for compliance with regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which requires clear data audit trails. Additionally, this information aids in reproducing scientific research, validating experimental results, and managing the ever-increasing complexity and volume of metadata.\n\nIn this way, data provenance is similar to data lineage because the information is essential for ensuring data authenticity, integrity, and reliability. This makes both data lineage and provenance vitally important across industries and applications, from supporting the service quality and operational efficiency of massive telecommunications companies to case-by-case applications in business analytics.\n\nDespite the similarities between data provenance and lineage, they are distinct concepts. What’s more, applying data provenance as a process further distinguishes it from its contextual cousin. So, let’s use an entertaining analogy to ensure we understand how to give provenance its due.\n\nHow are data provenance and data lineage different?\n\nTo help draw a clearer distinction between data provenance and lineage, consider this basic use case:\n\nA business intelligence (BI) team in a large organization needs to generate some reports to aid in executive decision-making.\n\nOne humble data engineer, our hero, compiles relevant customer data (i.e., customer profiles, demographics, shopper behavior) into a dataset and delivers it to the BI team, as requested.\n\nWith the data in hand, the BI team plugs the dataset into a data visualization tool and begins analyzing it, hunting for trends and insights.\n\nLet’s visualize this use case through a cinematic lens (pun intended). The BI team, scouring that customer data for said trends and insights? That’s a movie (you choose the genre).\n\nThis movie has a prequel. That’s data provenance: all the unique backstory, characters, and formative events that, together, made the dataset what it is today. The data provenance here would include all processes and methodologies the data engineer used to collect, cleanse, and transform customer data from multiple data producers pre-delivery.\n\nChances are good that our main movie will also have a sequel or two. Any and all sequels will be data lineage—chronicling the continued adventures of the dataset as the plot and characters flow on and progress through various systems, data consumers, and subsequent use cases.\n\nSo, as different yet equally valuable facets of data management, provenance and lineage help engineers, analysts, auditors, and administrators answer different types of questions.\n\nData provenance answers these questions:\n\nWho created this data, and when?\n\nHow was this data initially collected/generated?\n\nWhat standards and methodologies were used to collect this data?\n\nWhat is the original data source?\n\nData lineage answers these questions:\n\nWhich processes or systems did this data come from?\n\nWhat transformations has this data undergone?\n\nWhere will it go next?\n\nHow will this data be applied in downstream processes and systems?\n\nHow data professionals put data provenance to work\n\n1. Ensuring data integrity and authenticity\n\nIf data is the new oil, data quality is its sweetness (i.e., “sweet crude,” data’s relative value). Data provenance provides a comprehensive history of data that includes sources of the data, changes that were made to it, and who made the changes. This historical record becomes essential for helping teams verify the authenticity and integrity of organizational data. When data quality can be verified, that data can be trusted—applicable for reporting, analysis, and decision-making.\n\n2. Supporting data quality\n\nTherefore, data provenance is intrinsically linked to data quality—providing the context needed for data teams to assess the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of their data. When the history of data is clear, teams can more easily identify the root causes of data issues if, or when, they arise. This reduces the time needed to implement corrective measures, helping to maintain high data quality over time.\n\n3. Facilitating compliance and auditing\n\nIndustries are increasingly subject to data privacy and security regulations that require fastidious data management and record-keeping practices. Data provenance ensures organizations keep data compliant and secure by providing a verifiable trail of its data origins and transformations.\n\nThis makes provenance a key contributor to audit trails—when data teams need to demonstrate compliance with specific regulations and laws, avoiding penalties and damage to organizational reputation.\n\n4. Enhancing transparency and accountability\n\nThe micro to compliance’s macro, day-to-day use and reliance on data requires ongoing transparency and accountability. The audit trail of a piece of data that provenance enables also fosters trust and accessibility among data users and stakeholders, ensuring all parties are confident in the validity of the data used to do their jobs.\n\n5. Improving data security\n\nData provenance allows data teams to make sure the logs they use to track data maintain access and that changes are immutable. As such, these logs can significantly improve cybersecurity. Potential security issues can be quickly identified and responded to, protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access and breaches.\n\n6. Enhancing decision-making\n\nIt borders on the unavoidable; data is, in one way or another, informing most of the critical decisions made in organizations today. Therefore, data teams must guarantee all data used in the decision-making process is reliable and has not been inadvertently altered or tampered with. This goes a long way toward ensuring data is informing, not misinforming, decisions destined to drive business success.\n\n7. Increasing research reproducibility and validity\n\nFinally, among research, analyst, and scientific communities, data provenance is crucial to ensure the reproducibility and validity of studies. Provenance allows researchers to trace the origin of research data, understand any applied methodologies, and evaluate the integrity of their findings.\n\nThis traceability is essential for building robust, verifiable evidence and facilitating peer review and collaboration.\n\nKey characteristics of a well-defined data provenance system\n\nA well-defined data provenance system will be meticulously designed to track data as it is collected, transformed, and used throughout its data life cycle.\n\nWhat follows is a sense of how such systems work in practice and what sets well-defined data provenance systems apart.\n\nComprehensive data capture: Well-defined data provenance systems should automatically log detailed information about the data’s origin, transformations, and states throughout its life cycle. These details should include metadata, system processes, user inputs, and external interactions. Capturing detailed contextual information is key.\n\nData management tool integration: To avoid potential gaps in data tracking, data provenance systems should seamlessly integrate with existing data management systems (e.g., databases, data lakes, ETL tools). Seamless integration ensures all transformations and movements are logged without manual entry.\n\nGranular data tracking: Provenance systems should track data at a granular level, including individual data elements or records. This provides data teams with precise traceability and allows for detailed data history analysis. This is especially important when organizational data needs to undergo complex analysis or auditing.\n\nAutomated workflows for compliance and auditing: To avoid manual or reactive compliance or auditing, well-defined data provenance systems should include automated workflows to generate reports or alerts for anomalies.\n\nData integrity and security measures: These systems implement robust security measures to protect data and its provenance while helping to ensure its integrity. These measures typically include encryption, access controls, and regular integrity checks.\n\nUser-friendly access and visualization: As with other aspects of data management, information from data provenance systems should not be limited to technical users or rely on formats that are hard for stakeholders throughout the company to understand. User-friendly interfaces and visualization tools allow a wide range of professionals to easily access and interpret provenance data, increasing its value organization-wide.\n\nWhy data provenance and prequels both deserve a better script\n\nWhen the stakes are high, whether for data provenance or a movie prequel, script quality becomes vitally important.\n\nIn addition to establishing important story details, settings, and narrative elements, a prequel script needs to address more practical matters—like introducing key characters, budgetary constraints, and high audience expectations.\n\nA well-drafted data contract serves this purpose when relating to data provenance and data management in general. It handles source details, data handling specifications, quality requirements, and regulatory clauses.",
      "# [Data Collaboration: What Working Better Together Really Entails](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-collaboration)\nIt only takes a Google search (or a hot minute or two on LinkedIn) to find a long list of modern data trends:\n\nBig data and the mind-bogglingly explosive volume of it all. Competitive pressures across industries as more organizations endeavor to digitally transform. Machine learning and the use of AI becoming the rule, not the exception. The push towards data democratization. Globalization, distributed teams, and increasingly stringent and complex digital privacy governance and regulations.\n\nActing as a force multiplier, data collaboration can dramatically increase the effectiveness of organizational efforts and systems without the need for additional resources, effort, or investment. That said, there exists an exceptional amount of pressure on data engineers to get data collaboration right within their organizations.\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\nAll of this leads to a central truth: It’s imperative that organizations both understand and embrace what data collaboration is, how it functions to benefit an organization, why data engineers should begin their own collaboration initiatives by looking outside their profession, and best practices that can help facilitate success.\n\nWhat is data collaboration?\n\nData collaboration is the process or practice of sharing, managing, and working on data across different teams, departments, or even entire organizations to achieve common goals in a coordinated and strategic manner. These goals can vary but often relate to an organization wanting to increase data integration to make better decisions, improve personalization and customer experiences, or increase operational efficiency.\n\nBased on these goals, data collaboration may be applied on a case-by-case basis or implemented as a fundamental aspect of how an organization functions. But to fully understand (and appreciate) data collaboration, we must go beyond its technical definition and touch on the complicated interplay it relies upon and enables in data-driven ecosystems.\n\nData sharing, one of the main aspects of data collaboration, will often involve combining datasets (i.e., collections of data) from different departments within an organization and external data producers.\n\nPartnerships between departments and external sources will be unique to an organization, as differing business outcomes may require data sharing with a variety of data sources—suppliers, consultants, customers, research institutions, or other businesses. This diversity is important, as this pooling of resources and knowledge enriches data, leading to better, more comprehensive insights.\n\nApplication programming interfaces (APIs) play a vital role in facilitating the connection and communication between all the differing software applications data providers bring to the table. Workflows ensure data sets are collected, processed, analyzed, and utilized accurately and efficiently. And visualization tools like dashboards play a vital role, enabling data collaborators to more easily monitor, report, and make decisions based on their enriched data.\n\nBut the value data collaboration creates can’t come at the expense of data security. Data access—and stakeholders maintaining control of their data throughout the data collaboration process—is essential. So data teams must stringently manage permissions, controlling access at various levels to ensure these newly created datasets remain compliant and abide by all relevant privacy regulations.\n\nWhile the above only scratches the surface of the complexities involved, it sheds light on the interplay required to successfully implement data collaboration to drive insights, innovation, and improved business performance.\n\nThe benefits of data collaboration\n\nAgain, there are as many potential benefits of data collaboration as ways of using data. In general, within an organization, these typically include better organizational knowledge and skill development, more creativity, innovation, and better cross-functional alignment,\n\nHowever, for an organization's more technical practitioners, beneficial use cases may specifically include the following:\n\nEnhanced data change management processes\n\nRobust data collaboration helps ensure any and all changes to data structures, formats, and usage are systematically recorded, reviewed, and implemented with full visibility.\n\nThe resulting transparency and accessibility facilitates clearer communication among data stakeholders. In this way, data collaboration also improves the traceability of changes and better compliance with data governance standards.\n\nImproved dependency alerting\n\nData collaboration also enables dependency alerting to become more accurate and proactive. In turn, the organization can benefit from earlier identification of potential issues, more agility to respond to changes, and minimized impact of said changes on dependent processes or systems.\n\nHighly collaborative teams may also find it easier to automate alerts that notify relevant data consumers in real time about changes in the data they depend on.\n\nChange request centralization\n\nBusiness environments are increasingly dynamic, meaning that change requests can come from anywhere in the organization (and at any time). Data collaboration also benefits here as it can centralize the process of requesting changes to data or data practices. Further, the requests themselves become more structured and efficient.\n\nChange requests submitted through a centralized platform enable teams to log, prioritize, and address each in a timely manner. Overall, this can make an organization’s data management strategy more adaptive.\n\nFaster detection and response to broken data pipelines\n\nIn addition to consistently producing better solutions, collaborative data analysis can help teams identify issues before they become problems (and fix problems before they create issues). As a result, teams (not just individuals) get better at analyzing and interpreting trends, patterns, correlations, and anomalies related to their data pipelines over time.\n\nThis also means that when a pipeline does break down, the collaborative team is better equipped to drill down into an issue faster, decreasing time-to-resolution.\n\nData models evolve more effectively\n\nData models enjoy enhanced flexibility and scalability thanks to robust data collaboration. This fosters an environment where stakeholder feedback, insights, and emerging needs are better integrated into the evolution of data models.\n\nAdditionally, the improved alignment with business goals and increased ability to leverage new data sources often improves the effectiveness of data-driven initiatives.\n\nImproved potency of data contracts\n\nAs a final benefit of note, while drafting data contracts, highly collaborative organizations enjoy more opportunities to reduce misunderstandings or potential conflicts regarding their data use.\n\nData contracts are drafted, agreed on, and maintained with contributions from all relevant parties. As such, they enter service optimally comprehensive, clear, and aligned with the needs of all stakeholders—facilitating smoother data exchanges and integration efforts.\n\nThe valuable (and somewhat counterintuitive) starting point for successful data collaboration initiatives\n\nMelvin Conway is well-known among software developers for Conway’s Law: “Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.” As noted by the author, speaker, and software developer Martin Fowler, this axiom is important enough “to affect every system [he’s] come across, and powerful enough that you're doomed to defeat if you try to fight it.”\n\nThere’s something immutable to this idea—that the things we make are invariably shaped by the ways we make them—which is why Conway’s Law can, and should, serve as a potent starting point for data engineers to champion data collaboration best practices in their own organizations.\n\nHere’s why:\n\nData engineering often requires an extensive focus on technical proficiency and system optimization. Engineers typically work on specific systems or components within larger organizational architectures.\n\nIn these cases, user experience or user-centric design may naturally take a back seat, while the predominant roles and goals of the data engineer may not include a deep understanding of the broader dynamics at play within an organization, especially how these dynamics pertain to data flow and usage. For engineers looking to head up or bolster a data collaboration initiative, these factors can lead to several blindspots.\n\nRephrased for the context at hand, Conway’s Law could instead read as follows: “In organizations where data engineers are tasked with implementing data collaboration initiatives, the structure and effectiveness of these initiatives will mirror the communication patterns and organizational structures within the company.\"\n\nAs such, embracing our take on Conway’s Law grounds the data engineer in a mindset where cross-functional collaboration needs to be championed in addition to the technical aspects of data systems.\n\nDespite the complexity and time invested in existing projects, the engineer must realize that the organizational change inherent in data collaboration necessitates adaptations in data systems, with an emphasis on flexibility and scalability.\n\nAnd, as part of true collaboration, the pursuit of technical solutions can’t overtake the need for clear data governance structures that both support and mirror the overall communication and decision-making processes of the organization.\n\nWith this important keystone of collaboration in place, data engineers can employ best practices knowing that the foundation they’re building on is immutable as the law that informs it.\n\nBest practices for implementing data collaboration\n\nThere exists a healthy bit of overlap for how best to implement a data process or practice. Since data quality is a foundational requirement for all data activities, it should be viewed and treated as a product, not a commodity. Clear governance and policies need to be established to ensure data is shared and used correctly.\n\nThere are, however, a few best practices specific to successful data collaboration:\n\n1. Encourage cross-functional collaboration\n\nActively break down organizational silos (data silos, departmental silos, etc.) in order to foster collaboration across different departments and teams. Whatever their justification, siloing stifles the diverse data and sources that productive collaboration hinges on.\n\n2. Promote transparency and open communication\n\nWhile important in all areas, everyone involved in data collaboration, be it a project or process, needs to be accountable for promoting transparency and open communication. Build on the clear policies and guidelines established through governance. Establish feedback mechanisms. Recognize and reward openness as data collaboration begins to thrive.\n\n3. Invest in people and processes before tools and technologies\n\nIn data engineering, prioritizing tools and technologies is common. But that doesn’t make it correct. Due to the complexity and scale of data collaboration in organizations, even the tech provides diminishing returns without skilled personnel operating within a robust framework of efficient, adaptable processes. It will be the people and processes that begin to cultivate a culture of collaboration, one where technology serves an organization’s goals (as opposed to dictating them).\n\nFrom Conway to contracts: Why collaborative success hinges on better beginnings\n\nFor those seeking to harness the full potential of their data through data collaboration, the implementation of data contracts inevitably emerges as a pivotal tool. These contracts serve as a blueprint ensuring clarity, consistency, and compliance in the collaborative process, much like architectural plans in building design.\n\nAs we navigate the intricate landscape of data collaboration, the value of well-defined data contracts cannot be overstated. They are the cornerstone of effective data management, enabling organizations to unlock the true power of their data assets.",
      "# [Data Compliance: What You Need to Know in 2025](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-compliance)\nData leaders and stakeholders in data-driven organizations are already well aware of the stakes inherent in data compliance. But as the present reality within data environments becomes more challenging to deal with, it can be hard to keep an eye on what's just over the horizon.\n\nThat said, global and US state-level privacy laws are set to expand. As just one example, fines for non-compliance under the American Privacy Rights Act (APRA) may reach up to 4% of a company's global revenue. This will mirror the stringent penalties under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), signaling that non-compliance will carry increasingly heavy financial consequences.\n\nWith all the potential fines and reputation damage at play, the stakes that data leaders face would be intimidating in any casino. Therefore, access to information about tomorrow's key compliance, security, and privacy concerns is crucial to ensuring that no one in their org is rolling the dice regarding data compliance.\n\nAnd this information ideally consists of more than understanding what’s in store regarding data compliance. Through some analysis, data leaders can begin to strategize what to do moving forward.\n\nAwareness: Key data compliance trends for 2025\n\nAs big data continues to make the business world smaller, data leaders face trends of increasing global proportions.\n\nThat said, we now face an inflection point where access to the scale and complexity business owners need to keep their organizations competitive is less of an issue. The quality and ethical implications of data use, however, have never been more important.\n\n1. Stricter data privacy laws for greater global standardization\n\nAs 2025 peeks out at us from just over the horizon, so too do more stringent data privacy laws. These laws are spurring a move toward global standardization.\n\nNew regulations, such as the APRA in the US, will introduce federal standards that align with the European Union’s GDPR (which went into effect back in 2018). Once in effect, these new regulations will require companies to adapt their data compliance programs across regions.\n\nThe ensuing shift will simplify some aspects of compliance for businesses but will increase accountability across third-party vendors and data processors as a result.\n\nOrganizations must build security safeguards and transparent data practices into their compliance frameworks (i.e., fully embracing data governance as code) to remain fully compliant with these increasingly global privacy regulations.\n\n2. Broader data sovereignty and localization mandates\n\nAdditionally, nations around the world are pushing for stronger data sovereignty through localization laws that mandate the storage and processing of personal information within specific geographic boundaries.\n\nFor organizations operating globally, this trend requires revisiting data storage and access strategies to ensure compliance with local laws while avoiding significant penalties.\n\nMoreover, as more regions embrace these localization mandates, data leaders must prioritize regulatory compliance within their organizations. By doing so, they actively safeguard sensitive and proprietary data, keeping it securely stored and managed as part of their data management frameworks according to each jurisdiction's standards.\n\n3. Increasing demands for more ethical and compliant AI data governance\n\nAs AI systems increasingly rely on vast amounts of personal data, rapid integration of AI into business operations is driving the creation of new and unique compliance requirements.\n\nRegulators, in turn, are focusing more intently on AI governance to ensure data is handled ethically, securely, and in accordance with evolving privacy laws.\n\nThe resulting shift will compel data leaders to robustify existing frameworks they use to oversee AI-driven data practices—ensuring compliance with both local and international data protection regulations. Failing to do so will be unacceptable, if it isn’t already, as it will jeopardize the ethical development and deployment of AI technologies.\n\n4. Deeper integrations of data privacy and security in compliance foundations\n\nAs cybersecurity threats grow more sophisticated, data security and functionality like automated data governance are gaining precedence among the other facets responsible for robust data compliance, like data lifecycle management and risk management.\n\nTo adapt, organizations must adopt proactive measures like real-time monitoring, access control, and encryption to safeguard sensitive information from vulnerabilities and unauthorized access, both from data consumers and external bad actors.\n\nIn addition to regulatory requirements, post-pandemic consumer expectations are driving this trend, as consumers demand greater transparency in data handling, and rightly so.\n\nIncreasingly essential components of a strong data compliance program include the following:\n\nSecurity standards and access control: By implementing standards like SOX, PCI DSS, and NIST, data leaders provide individuals with only the customer data they are authorized to use, such as credit card information and other personally identifiable information in relevant industries.\n\nRisk management and assessment: Leaders should also implement a consistent cadence of risk assessments and data audits to pinpoint compliance vulnerabilities and mitigate cyber threats effectively. Proactivity is key here, as data teams who actively keep data aligned with data compliance regulations can also foster more robust information security management programs.\n\nData deletion and data storage protocols: In addition to secure storage, data deletion policies play a critical role in protecting customer privacy. Sometimes overlooked in older, more-is-better approaches to data management, data leaders who champion these policies improve organizational adherence to privacy regulations, making certain their teams securely erase outdated or irrelevant data in compliance with regulatory requirements.\n\nBy embedding these data security practices into a comprehensive compliance program, organizations can reduce the risks associated with data breaches and non-compliance and position themselves as trustworthy custodians of sensitive information.\n\n5. Better safeguards for health information through tighter healthcare compliance standards\n\nExperts predict the emergent direct-to-consumer healthcare industry will gain traction in 2025 as patients increasingly seek expanded access to drugs and medical devices without going through traditional healthcare providers.\n\nHealthcare compliance demands a heightened focus on privacy and security, especially in light of regulations like HIPAA, which governs the handling of health information in the US.\n\nHealthcare providers and service organizations are required to meet strict standards in data collection, storage, and access to protect patient information from data breaches and unauthorized use.\n\nKey factors that influence healthcare compliance in 2025 will include:\n\nPrivacy regulations and data protection laws: HIPAA, along with emerging health-focused privacy laws, ensures that healthcare organizations prioritize the security of health information and patient privacy.\n\nData collection, access, and storage: As the healthcare industry continues to digitize patient data, healthcare providers must adhere to data compliance regulations governing the storage, access, and management of health data. Effective access control, data safeguards, and consistent data audits are essential to protect patient data from vulnerabilities and ensure compliance.\n\nIndustry-specific compliance: Healthcare providers must stay agile and responsive to changing standards around patient data privacy and secure information handling. This requires balancing data access needs with compliance obligations. As compliance frameworks evolve, organizations should conduct regular assessments to continuously meet new regulations and maintain patient trust.\n\nThe healthcare industry’s unique requirements for data privacy and protection underscore the importance of compliance programs that address sector-specific regulations.\n\nHowever, by embedding robust data safeguards and adopting healthcare-compliant data storage and access controls, data leaders in relevant industries ensure that patient data remains protected while their organization maintains optimal compliance.\n\nAnalysis: Increasingly critical data compliance challenges in 2025\n\nBased on these trends, data leaders are in the hot seat—responsible in large part for helping their organizations prepare to navigate these changing tides of data compliance.\n\nDoing so creates specific challenges for anyone in these roles, including the mounting complexities of new regulations (both broad and niche), the persistent need to keep data de-siloed, and consumers who, on average, care more about the information they share online, and who expect far more transparency from those who use it.\n\nKeeping pace with stricter regulations and global standardization\n\nIn addition to APRA, as mentioned in our introduction, 2025 will witness the emergence of new state privacy laws in Delaware, Iowa, and Minnesota. These laws will further complicate the already intricate framework of regulations in the United States.\n\nAs always, evolving data compliance regulations demand continuous monitoring and adaptation to avoid non-compliance penalties, which can include fines, reputational damage, and increased scrutiny from regulatory bodies.\n\nThat said, rising cyber threats and vulnerabilities compound this challenge and force organizations to adopt stronger safeguards and security standards, such as those defined by SOX, PCI DSS, and HIPAA.\n\nBreaking down data silos to enhance accessibility and governance\n\nData silos will continue to be significant barriers to compliance in 2025. Fragmented data spread across systems or departments prevents organizations from implementing consistent security controls, such as access control and authentication, which are critical for ensuring compliance with privacy regulations. These silos also hinder effective governance and make it difficult to meet requirements for data accuracy, accessibility, and storage management.\n\nBreaking down silos enables a more comprehensive view of operations. This, in turn, not only improves efficiency and overall data quality but also facilitates the alignment of data handling practices with compliance frameworks.\n\nFor organizations that are managing sensitive customer or health information, this step is critical for maintaining regulatory compliance, particularly under laws like GDPR and HIPAA.\n\nEmbedding privacy by design into compliance foundations\n\nPrivacy by Design (PbD) is increasingly becoming a regulatory mandate under frameworks like Europe’s GDPR, Brazil’s General Data Protection Law (LGPD), and emerging US privacy laws. This approach requires organizations to proactively embed privacy considerations into the design and development of systems, processes, and products rather than applying them retroactively.\n\nBy 2025, PbD will be integral for managing compliance across industries and will ensure that safeguards for personal data—including data deletion protocols—are in place throughout the data lifecycle. However, implementing PbD can be challenging, as it requires cross-functional data collaboration between legal, IT, and product development teams to ensure they consistently prioritize consumer privacy.\n\nAs technologies like AI create new opportunities and risks, organizations will need to align their AI governance efforts with privacy regulations to address emerging ethical concerns while maintaining compliance. PbD will remain a cornerstone of these efforts, ensuring the design of systems and processes anticipate and mitigate compliance vulnerabilities from the outset.\n\nAction: 3 key strategies for adjusting to 2025’s evolving compliance needs\n\nAs it stands, data leaders should begin rethinking (or at least thoroughly considering) their current approaches to compliance. Despite high stakes, most won't need to scratch their current strategies and processes completely.\n\nThe value here is to reconcile what's worked in the past with what must work in the near future—optimizing solutions to address evolving demands to help their organizations both keep pace and stay competitive.\n\n1. Embrace upstream data contracts\n\nData contracts are agreements between data producers and consumers. They define how data is structured, shared, and maintained. As such, a data contract that is drafted and implemented upstream enforces data quality, schema consistency, and compliance requirements at the data lifecycle’s inception point. This is why data contracts are particularly critical for navigating stricter data privacy laws, such as APRA or GDPR, as well as sector-specific mandates like HIPAA in healthcare.\n\nBy embedding these contracts into CI/CD pipelines, companies can automate the enforcement of data standards, which reduces the risk of non-compliance due to schema-breaking changes or poor-quality data.\n\nThis proactive approach supports governance frameworks and ensures that organizations handle sensitive data, like health information and customer data, in full compliance with regulations.\n\nData contracts also reduce technical debt and align all stakeholders on data handling requirements, which is increasingly important as organizations face global standardization pressures and localization mandates.\n\n2. Automate your data lineage processes and audits\n\nAutomated data lineage tools provide a real-time view of how data moves through an organization, from its origin to its final destination. Transparent data flows are essential for demonstrating compliance with evolving data compliance regulations—such as GDPR or PCI DSS—and meeting industry-specific requirements, including those in the payment card industry or healthcare.\n\nAutomated lineage tools simplify compliance reporting by creating audit trails that regulators can review efficiently. These tools also ensure that data deletion and access protocols align with privacy regulations. As regulations grow more complex in 2025, real-time monitoring and lineage automation will be critical for identifying vulnerabilities, ensuring compliance across data lifecycles, and reducing the manual burden on compliance teams.\n\n3. Invest in staff training and promote optimal awareness\n\nHuman error remains a significant factor in compliance failures and data breaches. Training employees on evolving regulations, cybersecurity best practices, and internal compliance protocols is essential to mitigate this risk. In sectors like healthcare, where compliance with HIPAA and privacy-focused regulations is paramount, staff awareness plays a critical role in protecting health information.\n\nRegular training programs help organizations adapt to regulatory changes and foster a culture of privacy and data integrity. This approach ensures that employees understand their responsibilities in managing sensitive data, from implementing access controls to adhering to secure data storage and deletion standards.\n\nPlanning ahead: Future-proof your organization’s compliance framework by shifting data left\n\nMoving forward into 2025, we can agree that proactive and integrated data compliance will be essential, not optional. VPs of data must lead the way by building scalable, adaptable compliance frameworks that meet regulatory demands and protect organizational trust.\n\nBut for these leaders, it’s of critical importance to understand that high stakes are best managed well before cards ever hit the table. The answers here are upstream, embracing tools and technologies that prevent data compliance from becoming a gamble in the first place.",
      "# [Database Schema: The Need for (and Risks of) Iterative Evolution](https://www.gable.ai/blog/database-schema)\nThe humble, foundational aspects of data environments make it possible for modern tools, solutions, and platforms to scale and adapt to our ever-evolving digital world.\n\nAnd while it’s understandable that an abundance of digital ink will be spilled to cover new frontiers, let’s not forget that said foundational aspects and their need to keep pace are just as important, if not more so.\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\nFor organizations of all sizes, database schema serves as a critical blueprint that dictates the functional structure of data management.\n\nThis is especially true for startups and smaller organizations, where data can be a significant driver of innovation and growth.\n\nDatabase schema, defined\n\nA database schema acts as the blueprint within a relational database management system (DBMS), outlining its logical structure and organization. Schemas are often defined using data definition language (DDL), which provides a clear, consistent way to define how data is stored in tables.\n\nDatabase schemas also define the relationships between these tables, incorporating integrity constraints to establish and maintain optimal data quality. Such organization makes efficient data retrieval, query optimization, and overall performance management possible, playing a crucial role in database design and operation.\n\nTo do so, database schema typically encompasses a wide range of database objects (but certainly not all of them). Schema primarily focuses on the specific database objects needed to define a given database’s structure and organization.\n\nTypically, these objects will include the following:\n\nTables: The core components of a database schema, tables store data in rows and columns, with each table representing a set of related data.\n\nIn the context of data warehouses or multidimensional database models, schemas often include more specialized “fact tables.” These specialized tables are designed to store quantitative data for analysis, known as facts, and often contain keys that link to related dimension tables, which store descriptive attributes.\n\nColumns: Within tables, columns (also known as fields) represent the attributes or properties of the data. Each column in a table is designed to store a specific type of data (e.g., integers, text, dates, etc.).\n\nRows: Individual records in a table are represented as rows, where each row in a table contains unique data for the corresponding columns.\n\nPrimary keys: These are special fields that uniquely identify each record in a table. A primary key ensures that each row in a table is distinct from all others.\n\nForeign keys: Fields in a table that link to primary keys in other tables are called foreign keys. These keys establish relationships between tables and are crucial for maintaining referential integrity within a database.\n\nIndexes: Functioning as an “address book” of sorts, indexes guide databases to the location of needed data more quickly. This functionality speeds up overall data retrieval from the database.\n\nStored procedures and functions: These are sets of SQL statements that perform tasks like calculations and data manipulation that are frequently reused.\n\nViews: A view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement. Just like a real table, views contain rows and columns. However, views are created with the data from one or more tables.\n\nConstraints: Constraints are rules that ensure the data in the database remains accurate and reliable.\n\nTriggers: Scripts that are automatically executed in response to certain events are referred to as triggers on a particular table or view in the database.\n\nAll together, these are the components that enable schema to function as the metaphorical blueprint, keeping databases optimally structured as their data is stored, organized, and managed.\n\nA note on schema types: While they often focus on similar data objects, different schemas may vary depending on the nature of the data being used and the requirements of their respective systems. In exploring the types of database schemas, database administrators may use a conceptual or logical schema during the planning phase.\n\nHowever, they may transition to a physical schema for implementation and then a physical database schema to manage the physical aspects of the database when it’s put into use. Data scientists and business analysts, on the other hand, might rely on star schema to enable complex queries or snowflake schema if data integrity and reduction of data redundancy take precedence.\n\nThe need for iterative schema evolution\n\nIterative schema evolution is a critical aspect of successfully implementing and managing a database, particularly in dynamic environments where business requirements and data models are subject to change. Its importance can be understood in relation to other key factors in database management:\n\nAdaptability to changing requirements: One of the most significant challenges in database management is the continuous need to adapt to evolving business needs. Iterative schema evolution allows for gradual, controlled modifications to the database schema, ensuring that it can keep pace with changing requirements without disrupting ongoing operations.\n\nData integrity and consistency: While maintaining data integrity and consistency is vital, overly rigid schema designs can hinder necessary changes. Iterative schema evolution, when done correctly, allows for schema modifications while maintaining data integrity through versioning, migration scripts, and backward compatibility.\n\nPerformance optimization: Over time, it's common for the performance requirements of a given database to change. Iterative schema evolution enables incremental adjustments to optimize performance, such as indexing strategies and partitioning, without the need for a complete overhaul.\n\nScalability: As the volume of data grows, a database schema might need to be adjusted to scale effectively. Iterative evolution allows for scaling-related changes, such as denormalization or sharding, to be implemented as needed.\n\nCompatibility with development practices: Modern development practices, such as Agile and DevOps, emphasize continuous improvement and rapid iteration. Iterative schema evolution aligns well with these methodologies, allowing database schema changes to be integrated into the broader development lifecycle.\n\nRisk management: By enabling small, incremental changes, iterative schema evolution reduces the risk associated with large-scale database modifications. It allows for easier rollback, testing, and validation of changes.\n\nThe risks of iterative schema evolution\n\nAttempting to enable iterative schema evolution without a data contract in place does, unfortunately, present several challenges and risks.\n\nThese risks are amplified in environments where data integrity, consistency, and compliance are crucial:\n\nLack of predictability and standardization: Without support, changes to the data schema can occur in an ad-hoc, inconsistent manner. The unpredictability this introduces can lead to issues in data quality and compatibility, especially when logical constraints are not uniformly applied across multiple teams or systems.\n\nData integrity risks: Sporadic schema changes can lead to data integrity issues. If a field's data type is altered without proper synchronization, for example, it could lead to data loss or corruption.\n\nCompliance violations: In regulated industries or under laws like GDPR or CCPA, organizational data needs to be handled according to specific guidelines. Iterative schema changes can inadvertently lead to non-compliance, resulting in legal and financial repercussions.\n\nIncreased testing and validation overhead: Schema changes require extensive testing and validation to ensure they don’t break existing systems. While important, this process becomes more complex and time-consuming as a database needs to evolve, as there are no predefined rules or expectations to test against.\n\nDependency management issues: In a microservices architecture or in systems with multiple data sources, changes in one part often affect others. Managing these dependencies over time compounds testing complexity while the subsequent risks of system failures or downtime increase.\n\nDifficulty in rollbacks: If a schema change leads to issues, a rollback may be required. However, this operation becomes difficult when no record of the previous schema state is available, or when data may have already been transformed in a way that is not easily reversible.\n\nImpact on data consumers: Applications or services consuming the data may face issues if they are not aware of or prepared for schema changes. This can lead to system errors, application crashes, or incorrect data processing.\n\nScaling challenges: As an organization’s systems scale, managing schema evolution takes an increasing toll on data teams. Moreover, as the volume of organizational data and the number of interconnected services increases, the complexity and risk of making changes without breaking existing functionalities also grows exponentially.\n\nWhy your database blueprints deserve their own blueprint\n\nData leaders in organizations of all sizes need to embrace the reality that their database will need to evolve. Therefore, any means or method that can mitigate the risks of iterative schema evolution should be embraced as well.\n\nEnter data contracts. For database designers and data engineers, these contracts can support the design of a database schema, not just its management.\n\nData contracts: Advantages for schema design\n\n1. Defining data structure and format\n\nEarly specification: Data contracts can provide an early specification of the data structure, including data types, formats, and fields, guiding the normalization process in database design. This helps in designing database tables and relationships that align with these specifications.\n\nConsistency across systems: When a database needs to interact with other systems, a data contract ensures that the schema is designed in a way that is compatible and consistent with these external systems.\n\n2. Setting standards and constraints\n\nData integrity: By defining the rules and constraints for data, contracts help in designing schemas that inherently support data integrity and validity.\n\nStandardization: Data contracts often include standardization rules, which are crucial in designing a schema with consistent syntax and structure.\n\n3. Guiding relationships and dependencies\n\nRelationship mapping: Contracts can outline the relationships between different data entities, providing a clear visual representation through an entity-relationship diagram in the schema design process.\n\nDependency management: Understanding the dependencies between different data elements as specified in a contract helps in designing a schema that efficiently manages these dependencies.\n\n4. Facilitating scalability and evolution\n\nFuture-proofing: Data contracts can include provisions for future changes, which can guide the design of a flexible and scalable schema.\n\nIterative development: As contracts may evolve, designing a schema with the ability to accommodate these changes is crucial. Data contracts provide guidelines on how the schema should adapt, ensuring it remains relevant and functional over time.\n\n5. Ensuring compliance and security\n\nCompliance: Data contracts often outline requirements for compliance with regulations. This can be integrated into the schema design to ensure that data storage and processing meet legal standards.\n\nSecurity protocols: Contracts may specify security protocols or encryption standards, which can be considered in the schema design to ensure data is stored and accessed securely.\n\n6. Data governance\n\nGovernance framework: Data contracts often form part of a broader data governance strategy. Designing a schema with these contracts in mind helps align it with the organization's data governance policies, ensuring the effective organization of data.\n\nRole and access management: Data contracts may define roles and access levels for database users, which can influence the design of the schema in terms of access controls and data segregation.\n\n7. Optimizing performance and efficiency\n\nPerformance requirements: Contracts can specify performance requirements, guiding the design of efficient indexes, optimized query paths, and streamlined data structures.\n\nResource management: Understanding the expected data load and usage patterns from the contract can guide decisions on resource allocation and optimization in the schema design.\n\nReady to support your own database schemas? Here’s how to get started\n\nCompared to larger organizations, smaller organizations and startups often require wearing multiple hats, achieving more with less, and just doing what it takes to get the work done. That’s why it’s simply not worth leaving database schema unsupported, which effectively creates little ticking time bombs tucked away in some of the most vulnerable aspects of your data infrastructure.\n\nFortunately, we’re improving the process required to draft and implement a top-notch data contract, in part because everyone in our data-driven world (not just enterprise organizations) deserves the security and operational support they provide.\n\nReserve your spot now to learn more about Gable and how you can create a preventative strategy with data contracts.\n\n‍",
      "# [How to Think About Data Quality](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-quality)\nBig data is big enough that, yes, it still warrants the occasional media story or captivating infographic. But, increasingly, our collective attention needs to focus far more on the quality—not quantity—of data.\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\nHowever, good data quality doesn’t manifest itself. Management of specific factors and categories by data governance teams, data stewards, and the like is essential to ensure data from producers consistently reaches consumers in its optimal form.\n\nThis is why any data quality initiative should arguably begin with internal alignment on what those factors and categories entail.\n\nWhat are the 5 characteristics of data quality?\n\nLike many aspects of data engineering and science, the concept of data quality is quite simple until two professionals sit down to discuss it. Professionals of varying specialties and experience will, understandably, emphasize different characteristics concerning data quality they consider more important.\n\nBut at a very foundational level, we can define the quality of a specific dataset by evaluating five key characteristics:\n\nAccuracy: How accurate is the data at hand? Data values should represent the real-world event or instance it exists to depict.\n\nConsistency: High-quality data contains no contradictions across a given dataset or system.\n\nReliability: Referring to the trustworthiness of data sources, the reliability of a source can often be determined through data lineage.\n\nTimeliness: Whenever required, data is both up-to-date and available.\n\nUniqueness and completeness: Quality data is whole, with no missing values or parts.\n\nWhat are the 4 categories of data quality?\n\nTaken together, data quality characteristics allow us to quantify the quality of data flowing from producers to consumers. However, a categorical lens also provides valuable context for data governance when paired with the five factors above. Traditionally, these categories are organized to address specific areas of concern or dimensions.\n\nAs such, the four most common categories are as follows:\n\nAvailability and accessibility issues: Can the data be used when needed? Can it also be accessed by those who need it (and inaccessible to those who don’t)? In addition to permissions structures and security protocols, this category includes issues like system errors and data outages.\n\nAccuracy and integrity issues: Here we focus on whether the data is reliable and correct. Can it be trusted? Addressing this category typically involves correcting for inconsistencies, inaccuracies, and whether or not the relationships between datasets maintain their integrity.\n\nConformity issues: This category covers whether a dataset or system conforms to a predefined standard or set of business rules based on particular formats, standards, or patterns.\n\nRelevancy, completeness, and timeliness issues: This final category of data quality focuses on whether or not the data is current, complete in terms of covering all necessary aspects, and relevant to its intended use.\n\nIt bears repeating that these characteristics and categories are in no way mutually exclusive.\n\nFor instance, the characteristic of data \"completeness” can be seen in both the relevancy/completeness/timeliness and accuracy/integrity categories. While the quality characteristic of “reliability” also naturally slots into the accuracy/integrity category, it also relates to availability/accessibility issues.\n\nThe point is whether they’re characteristics or categories or both, use whichever makes the most sense based on your needs and the needs of your organization.\n\nThe five data quality characteristics might make more sense for metrics and measurement or data profiling. In contrast, the four categories may be more useful for data governance or managing stakeholder expectations.\n\nCharacteristics and categories, leveraged in tandem, can also support a balanced and effective approach to managing data quality in diverse scenarios.\n\nData quality vs. data integrity\n\nIt’s also important to clarify the difference between data quality and data integrity, as the nouns quality (how good or bad something is) and integrity (the quality of being honest and having immutable moral principles) can be used synonymously in some situations. However, regarding data, they are significantly different.\n\nHere's how:\n\nData quality, as we've defined above, refers to the condition or state of data at a given point in time. Being a finite measurement, the level of quality relates to the data's value as it can be used in specific, intended instances—such as in business operations, planning, or decision-making.\n\nData integrity, however, refers to the accuracy and consistency of data across its entire lifecycle. Does quality data from a reliable source fundamentally remain unchanged and unaltered once it's been ingested into an organization? And has it been accidentally or maliciously tampered with or corrupted? These are questions of data integrity.\n\nOther differences between quality and integrity relate to scope, implementation, overall concerns, and security issues related to data. In this sense, data quality and data integrity both relate to the reliability and trustworthiness of data.\n\nTogether, those contributing to data management have a way of referring to the usability of their data (data quality), and their ability to trust its quality will be consistent over time (data integrity).\n\nThe mission-critical impact data quality has on business\n\nAs is obvious now, data quality can have a profound effect on business initiatives and operations—both positive and negative.\n\nBenefits of high data quality\n\nMore efficient operations: High-quality data helps to streamline processes, reduce operational errors, and can lead to cost savings. The potency of data analytics, reporting, and forecasting also hinges on the availability of high-quality data.\n\nImproved decision-making: Timely, accurate, reliable data ensures that data-informed business decisions are grounded in reality, leading to better strategic decisions and outcomes.\n\nBetter customer relations: Accurate customer data enables businesses to tailor their offers, services, and communication to consumers, increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n\nCompliance and mitigated risks: Reliable, high-quality data reduces the risk of penalties and legal consequences by helping businesses comply with various regulations.\n\nIncreased trust: Organizations that prioritize high data consistency and quality data assets are more easily seen as trustworthy and reliable, which can strengthen their brand reputation in-market.\n\nInnovation fuel: Advanced analytics, AI, and machine learning processes live or die based on the reliability of data they have access to. So, too, does their ability to support innovative or completely new data-driven products and solutions.\n\nIncreased revenue: Ultimately, high-quality data can increase revenue as it enables more accurate pricing strategies, better campaign targeting, and the continual improvement of sales processes.\n\nIssues stemming from low data quality\n\nOperational inefficiencies: Stakeholder and business intelligence initiatives based on outdated or inaccurate data can produce poor—if not outright detrimental—business processes and outcomes.\n\nIncreased costs: Low-quality, inconsistent data leads to more mistakes, data discrepancies, and handling issues. And costs due to rework and remediation can get out of hand quickly.\n\nHindered digital initiatives: Poor data can grind digital transformation efforts to a halt, especially in cases where an organization wishes to leverage the benefits of advanced data-reliant technologies like artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nCompliance risks: Bad data can result in regulatory violations. And, in industries where data accuracy is paramount, organizations can face reputational damage and financial penalties.\n\nLoss of trust: Regular errors, issues, and inaccuracies can erode trust in general, both with stakeholders internally and customers externally.\n\nCustomer dissatisfaction: Flawed customer data can lead to miscommunication, bad targeting and personalization efforts, or errors in service delivery. For increasingly digitally savvy consumers, the resulting dissatisfaction can quickly lead to loss of business.\n\nDecreased revenue: A sustained lack of access to high-quality data can ultimately result in ineffective marketing campaigns, decreased sales effectiveness, and missed opportunities.\n\nHow to measure data quality\n\nData quality management, be it more or less formally practiced, should be considered table stakes in any modern business environment, not just in situations where data-driven decisions need to be accurate and effective.\n\nBut that doesn't mean measuring the quality of data is easy to do (especially at scale). After all, the idea of \"quality\" can sometimes be frustratingly subjective. Fortunately, utilizing a data quality assessment is an excellent way to both quantify what quality data means in the context of one's organization and assess it using multiple dimensions of data quality.\n\nPerforming a data quality assessment involves a series of sequential steps, the basics of which we've outlined here:\n\n1. Define your criteria\n\nBefore jumping into measurement, start by outlining clear criteria based on business needs. Based on those needs, outline which aspects of data quality are most relevant (i.e., which characteristics—be they five, or more, or less).\n\n2. Develop key performance indicators (KPIs)\n\nDetermine which KPIs can best be used to measure each aspect of data quality you’ve outlined as part of your criteria. Using our five characteristics to illustrate, these KPIs might be established by the following actions:\n\nComparing a sample of your data against a trusted source or standard, then using the percentage that matches to represent data accuracy.\n\nCalculating the percentage of missing data in a dataset to represent data completeness.\n\nQuantifying any identified discrepancies within a dataset or between datasets to represent data consistency.\n\nTracking the number of times a data source provides incorrect information or suffers outages to represent data reliability.\n\nMeasuring the delay between when data is generated and when it becomes available for use to represent data timeliness.\n\n3. Implement continuous monitoring\n\nAdd continuous monitoring tools to the mix as well, as they will help you constantly check and report on how the quality of your data is—or is not—improving over time based on your specific KPIs. To best do so, we always recommend establishing monitoring as early as possible. Setting up alerts to inform you of any significant deviations is also beneficial.\n\n4. Establish feedback loops\n\nWork needed to keep something from breaking is always preferable to working to fix what’s broken. This is why the time and effort required to establish feedback loops is well spent. Enabling data consumers to report anomalies or issues they encounter is valuable. But the fact that feedback loops keep data producers and consumers in lockstep—more often identifying problems before they become problematic—is invaluable.\n\n5. Implement data profiling tools\n\nData profiling tools analyze data to provide a statistical summary while highlighting inconsistencies or anomalies. The information provided can provide insights regarding outliers, patterns, and potential quality issues. Ultimately, however, profiling tools prove invaluable for helping teams identify and resolve issues as quickly as possible.\n\n6. Score data quality\n\nData quality scorecards can prove invaluable for clearly displaying the result of your ongoing data quality measurements against benchmarks you set. When used correctly, these scorecards also make it easier for stakeholders to understand the current state of the organization's data quality. Ideally, data quality scores should also be tied back to specific data products.\n\n7. Audit regularly\n\nAuditing can be periodic. But they should occur consistently, as the deep dives they require can reveal system issues that tend not to appear in day-to-day checks.\n\n8. Benchmark externally\n\nWhenever possible, compare your data quality metrics with industry standards or benchmarks. Doing so provides valuable context, helping you maintain a sense of where you stand relative to industry peers and best practices.\n\n9. Conduct a business impact analysis\n\nA business impact analysis can help you measure the actual bottom-line-impact data quality issues are having within your organization. In instances where poor data quality led to a flawed business decision, the cost implications of that decision should be made apparent.\n\n10. Review regularly (and continuously adapt)\n\nAs communication is a key aspect of maintaining high-quality data, review your measurement strategies to account for how data sources, tools, stakeholder expectations, and the overall business environment evolve.\n\nIf nothing else, when you keep stakeholders aware of the impact of data quality on business outcomes, they're more likely to support and participate in your quality improvement initiatives.\n\nThe best way to improve data quality\n\nBased on the above, ensuring data quality is less of a singular task and more of a continuous journey. And the process of managing data quality is fundamentally intertwined with the tools and strategies employed in its management, such as data quality tools that scrutinize and enhance accuracy, feedback mechanisms that perpetually refine it, and master data management (MDM) that ensures its consistency and accuracy across the organization.\n\nTruly, the quality of data as it moves downstream to consumers is dependent on its quality when it enters an organization. More specifically, if data from producers is flawed, the resulting analyses, decisions, and strategies it’s used for will be, too.\n\nThis brings us to a pivotal solution: data contracts. These can be seen as the vigilant gatekeepers ensuring that only the finest, most pristine data enters your organization's repositories.\n\nWhy data contracts are quintessential for high-quality data\n\nEnsuring consistency: Data contracts establish a standardized format, ensuring incoming data adhere to predetermined quality and structural benchmarks. With clear data expectations and the assurance of data quality and accuracy, organizations can collaborate more effectively.\n\nMinimizing errors: By defining the acceptable data parameters, data contracts inherently reduce the influx of erroneous data, safeguarding analytical outcomes.\n\nIntegration testing: Contracts enable teams to check upstream in a CI/CD pipeline before any breaking issues occur. This also helps bring data producers and consumers together, improving data collaboration and the general understanding of its use.\n\nEnhancing compliance: Data contracts ensure that data adheres to regulatory and organizational standards, mitigating compliance risks.\n\nOptimizing data management: By ensuring that only quality data enters the system, data management processes are streamlined and optimized.\n\nWith the stakes so high, quality should be contractual\n\nIn modern organizations, there will always be an alarming amount of things we simply can’t control. Often, these things add up to become the proverbial cost of doing business. This is why that which we can control deserves all the more investment—especially when, as data does, it can make all the difference in organizational success or failure.",
      "# [What is Data Lineage? Tools, Techniques, Examples](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-lineage)\nWhen data becomes more complex, big data analytics also becomes more complex—and, in turn, data compliance and regulations are even more complex.\n\nAnd this all ripples to affect the complexity of data governance.\n\nWhile data-driven decision-making actually becomes easier, maintaining competitive data advantages becomes more difficult. Access to quality data is already vital, but understanding how an organization uses that quality data is now essential.\n\nEnter: Data lineage.\n\nWhat is data lineage?\n\nData lineage refers to how specific data is used and transformed over time. Data professionals employ data lineage practices to record and share this data use and transformation as it occurs.\n\nTime out: How is data lineage different from data provenance and data governance?\n\nOne of the challenges of data management is that you can’t break out aspects of the data lifecycle and affix each to specific periods of time—past, present, or future.\n\nThis is why we sometimes find data, especially in large complex systems, to be a perceptual challenge. We can’t cleanly break it down into easily categorical chunks. For this reason, it can seem like all data (e.g., data flows, data assets, data environments, etc.) can, at times, be proverbially everything, everywhere, all at once.\n\nHowever, with data’s growing role in our lives, it’s important everyone works to understand these fundamental aspects of data management—as our collective ability to ensure data security, compliance, and data-driven decision-making relies on it.\n\nFortunately, we can use our new book on data contracts (now available in early release from our friends at O’Reilly Media) as an illustrated example of how provenance, governance, and lineage all relate.\n\nProvenance: Data Contracts: Developing Production-Grade Pipelines at Scale has two authors and a unique editorial history. The record of this authorship and editorial history over time is like the book’s data provenance.\n\nGovernance: Our publisher, O’Reilly, sets forth specific guidelines and standards—a prescribed framework—determining how the book should be used, secured, and maintained. These guidelines and standards also ensure the level of quality the book must aspire to. As such, this framework acts as the book’s governance.\n\nLineage: Finally, we want the book to find its way into the hands of people who will love it. Our distribution plan to make this happen can be mapped (i.e., tracked)—clearly showing how the book goes on to reach readers, where it is sent (both on and offline), who distributes it, and how it moves through various systems and processes as a distinct body of work. This map is the book’s lineage, and as such, the map becomes essential for troubleshooting, measuring the book’s impact, and analyzing any dependencies related to it.\n\nWhile the above hopefully parses the different roles that provenance, governance, and lineage play in effective data management, our hope is that it also illustrates their interdependencies—how each of the three functionalities improves the other two when orchestrated together.\n\n9 Common types of data lineage\n\nNow that we’ve simplified things, let’s go ahead and complicate them again (just a bit).\n\nIn data management, there are many different kinds of data lineage. There need to be—because different stakeholders and departments within an organization can use the same data in very different ways. And knowing everything about all data all the time isn’t necessary (despite what that one data analyst two cubicles over would have you believe).\n\nDepending on these varying user requirements and perspectives, some aspects, dimensions, and attributes will make more sense to map in one instance, and less (or not at all) in another. To this, other factors determining what should or should not be mentioned include data complexity, regulatory compliance, data governance, and strategy, among others. This leads us to nine common types of data lineage in use across organizations.\n\nBackward lineage: This type of data lineage traces the data flow from a given point back to its point of origin. Doing so can help data teams verify data quality related to different data outputs (e.g., data sets, reports, analytics results, etc.).\n\nForward lineage: By tracing data flow from a given point to its final destination, teams can evaluate the relevance and value of data inputs and measure the impact of changes to data or alterations enacted upon it.\n\nHorizontal lineage: The flow of data across different systems, platforms, and applications is mapped using horizontal data lineage—showing how data moves, integrates, and transforms between its source and its target. Mapping horizontal lineage also includes the tools and processes involved in these data flows.\n\nVertical lineage: Alternately, mapping the verticality of data refers to its flow within a specific system, platform, or application. This information helps data teams understand how data in these locations is structured, stored, and accessed at different layers, including tables, columns, keys, records, fields, and files.\n\nEnd-to-end lineage: Teams may also map the horizontal and vertical aspects of data together, referred to as end-to-end lineage. This is done when stakeholders need a holistic view of data provenance, usage, and quality.\n\nTable-level lineage and column-level lineage: When a much more detailed form of data tracking is required, table-level lineage—mapped at the table level of databases or systems—provides teams with a detailed, macro view of data flow. Viewing the data at the table level can be useful when performing impact analysis, data integrations, migrations, or compliance and auditing.\n\nHowever, data quality management, debugging, or detailed impact analysis can require an even more granular view of data. In these cases, column-level lineage illuminates how data moves between individual columns or fields in a table, shows how that data is altered, and provides a view of its dependencies.\n\nTechnical data lineage: Zooming back out, teams map technical data lineage to broadly track the flow of data as it moves through technical processes and transformations. The details of data’s journey from data producers to its final destination(s) are key for maintaining data efficiency, integrity, and transparency throughout an organization.\n\nOperational data lineage: Additionally, mapping how data is used and accessed in day-to-day business operations provides another way to track how data moves throughout an organization (albeit a slightly broader one). By focusing on operational systems, teams can conduct business impact analysis, compliance, and reporting, and gauge operational efficiency.\n\nBusiness data lineage: Finally, data flowing between business processes can also be mapped. Business data lineage takes less concern with the specifics of what is happening to data. Often utilized by less technical stakeholders, this form of mapping tells the story of how data is impacting the business as a whole.\n\nData lineage best practices: Our 9 recommendations\n\nSettling on the right best practices for data lineage is a lot like settling on the best title for a book on data contracts; both are exercises in limitations and precision. (And another good option always pops to mind the moment you think you’re “done.”)\n\nThat said, we think the following nine best practices, as a whole, accomplish two things:\n\nThey can be used to support the foundational needs for tracking effective data lineage across most organizations.\n\nThey balance these foundational needs with some advanced enhancements.\n\n1. Clarify objectives, tying them to IT and business needs\n\nEstablishing clear objectives before embarking on any initiative, data-related or otherwise, is crucial. In this instance, clarity helps data leaders ensure that all tools, policies, and procedures that make up an organization’s data lineage practices will be efficient, sustainable, and aligned with ongoing business needs.\n\nIt’s worth considering how data contracts help you get the most out of this process, as the value of ongoing and tangible evidence of how data lineage practices positively impact an organization over time can’t be overstated.\n\n2. Leverage automation to maximize lineage fidelity and scalability\n\nPlan to automate data lineage practices as much as possible. Gaining access to accurate and consistent information is the point, after all. Automation, especially automated data discovery, can play a crucial role here, as it reduces the risks of errors inherent in manual processes.\n\nAt the same time, automation promotes scalability—ensuring that data lineage practices (especially those related to metadata capture and management) remain functionally efficient over time.\n\n3. Vet tool and system integrations\n\nFor most of us tasked with implementing data lineage practices, chances are good an established data environment will already be in operation. Audit existing data management tools based on established objectives, ensuring they’ll contribute to maximizing the utility of data lineage information. You can then determine if you’ll need to invest in a dedicated data lineage tool or if some combination of existing tools and systems will provide the needed functionality.\n\nWhile reviewing integration capabilities, you might request demonstrations and trials, assess levels of support from potential vendors, and conduct cost-benefit analyses as needed.\n\n4. Normalize (and standardize) comprehensive documentation\n\nMaintaining detailed and accurate records of data lineage should be the rule, not the exception. This documentation becomes crucial for understanding data flows and ensuring data quality throughout the lifecycle.\n\nDepending on the size of organizations, data teams may also need to be vigilant regarding whether this documentation remains standardized over time. This contributes to robust data governance, guiding consistent understanding and use across departments and teams—reducing confusion while fostering solid communication.\n\n5. Establish robust security and access control\n\nSecurity has always been critical for protecting sensitive lineage information. But it’s increasingly critical to position data security as the responsibility of everyone, not just those in IT. To this, implement secure communications and help your co-workers understand why, at their most basic level, encryption and secure APIs are being used.\n\nEstablish a consistent cadence and maintain detailed access logs to make sure systems and tools are patched and updated regularly. Implement monitoring tools to automatically detect unusual access patterns and ensure the right alerts get sent to the right people at the right times. And, as more of the organization leans in to keep data secure, robust access controls become increasingly important. Consider utilizing security principles like the principle of least privilege as you define and refine which roles and responsibilities get specific data access.\n\n6. Take time to make time for stakeholder buy-in\n\nAt this point, you’re more or less ready to approach stakeholders for their support. Make sure you do, and that a tacit buy-in is what you actually walk away with.\n\nDepending on your stakeholders, it may help to engage with them early and often. Make sure you clearly outline and identify the benefits the organization’s data lineage practices will have. Demonstrate how the lineage practices align with the business and set realistic expectations, the latter of which can often be aided through a strategic series of pilot programs.\n\n7. Visualize lineage and support ongoing training\n\nYou probably visualized parts of your lineage proposal to help sell it. Carry the visualization forward, representing data lineage in ways that make it easy for employees with different experience levels, skill sets, and backgrounds to understand and digest.\n\nAs able, promote training that ensures different users understand how to leverage the tool or tools used to map data lineage. (Note: To promote this training, consider pizza.)\n\n8. Monitor and measure mapping effectiveness\n\nSystematic measurement requires systematic monitoring of how effective data lineage practices are over time. In turn, effectively doing both helps data teams ensure that supporting systems are robust, responsive, and stay aligned with organization governance and management objectives.\n\nIdeally, this monitoring and measurement isn’t limited to lineage alone but functions as part of broader data management efforts.\n\n9. Review and update lineage practices regularly\n\nThe tail of the best-practices snake here consists of regular audits and reviews of the data lineage process as it unravels.\n\nThis is vital, as it allows data teams to adjust the granularity of data lineage mapping, balancing utility across users and uses while optimizing for evolving stakeholder needs.\n\nA data catalog can also be beneficial here. When embedded with data lineage information, these catalogs make it easier for users to get at and understand the data they need, enhancing overall data management.\n\nRemember that in data lineage, “well-begun” is half-done\n\nThe potential impact of a map directly correlates to the quality of information used to create it.\n\nBest practices, in addition to a clear understanding of the concept, certainly make data lineage practices more efficient and effective. But shifting the emphasis and expectation of data quality further left can make them exceptional.\n\nBe among the first to find out the role data contracts can (and increasingly do) play in the lineage of data by signing up for our product waitlist at Gable.ai.\n\n‍",
      "# [Data Governance: What Is It + Best Practices](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-governance)\nRegarding data, knowing how, who, and what are the most critical questions to govern it efficiently and responsibly. Data governance gives organizations the strategy to manage their information.\n\nIn this article, we’ll define data governance. Then, we’ll dive into why it’s essential, critical pillars of governance, its benefits, and its challenges. By the end, you’ll learn about one of the most innovative ways to govern your data assets: combining the common reactive approach with a more efficient, preventative strategy.\n\nWhat is data governance?\n\nData governance sets clear rules for handling and stewarding customer information throughout its lifecycle. It ensures data is accurate, used correctly, and kept safe.\n\nOne great way to imagine a data governance program is by picturing the following scenario:\n\nSuppose you buy an RV from an estate sale. It works great and looks terrific, but the seller says you get the whole package. Everything inside from the previous owners is yours. There might be something valuable in there, but you won’t know until you look around and sift through the items (and clutter) in the vehicle.\n\nThese objects, like pieces of data, have to be organized into a few categories:\n\nDetection: You discover and identify what’s in the RV. There might be old vinyl records in a cubby, family photographs in the closet, or valuable jewelry left behind. Some things might be useful, others worthless, while different pieces might have significance in the future (for example, maybe you don’t need the power drill you found in an old toolbox, but you might need it when you want to make minor improvements in the future).\n\nClassification: Now, it’s time to classify each item and formalize what you’ve found. Label the value and use of each item. Organize everything so you can easily access it when it’s time to move them to the right place.\n\nProcess: Decide the policy you’ll base decisions on, like how you plan on using the items. What determines a good object or not? Where should it go? Create a strategy to follow.\n\nParameters: Now that you have the process on paper, you can follow specific guidelines to determine what to do with each piece—a set of clear rules.\n\nCommunication: Through documentation with metadata management, you can add the vital information you need to retrieve and understand it. In the context of the RV, it might look like labels, a notebook explaining everything, or another system entirely. This data catalog also articulates to others what they should do with the items—there’s clear data lineage.\n\nLike the RV example, those governing data start with a central location. From there, they must decide what to do with the data, and who it should go to.\n\nFor example, different teams within an organization require different data sets, instructions on how to use them, and permissions for data access. Marketing teams, accounts receivable, customer service teams, and tech/product support would look different in the data governance context—especially as it may include social security numbers and sensitive data.\n\nThe data team can enact the process for governance that would create a way to protect everyone, provide accurate information at the right time, and provide clear guidelines on how to use it.\n\nWhy is it important?\n\nGood data governance has become essential now more than ever. Thanks to innovative technology (like artificial intelligence and machine learning) and customers living more of their lives online, there is a significant amount of information to collect, analyze, and use for decision-making and improving customer experiences.\n\nCustomers also expect you to use data efficiently, with McKinsey & Company reporting that 71% of consumers want personalized interactions and 76% get frustrated when companies fall short of it.\n\nThe importance of data governance initiatives is two-fold:\n\n1. Accurate, responsible, and efficient data for companies\n\nWith an effective data governance strategy, organizations can ensure high-quality data, use it responsibly, and maximize output.\n\nCompanies should ensure they have the right compliance, procedures, and tools to get the most out of data and use it to improve the customer experience.\n\nOne significant challenge is dealing with reactive strategies. While a quick response is ideal when something goes wrong with your data collection and processing, it’s not enough to ensure quality data governance. Companies need a preventative solution.\n\nGable's innovative technology helps organizations improve data quality at scale by fostering communication between data producers and consumers via data contracts. These contracts eliminate the human error component and stop mistakes before they happen.\n\n2. Ensuring customer trust in today’s climate\n\nThe data industry knows the challenges it’s faced with privacy, transparency, and consumer trust—in short, the world is paying attention to how companies handle data.\n\nCompanies should be able to uphold regulations like GDPR and perform above standards to remove themselves from avoidable pitfalls. They can position themselves as one of the industry's safest, most trustworthy businesses.\n\nSince 2019, data privacy search inquiries have doubled, signaling the need for more responsible data management. It’s no longer enough to handle data ethically, but consumers want full transparency and clarity on what’s collected and how it’s used.\n\nSource: Google Trends | Search inquiries for data privacy have doubled in only a few years.\n\nEffective data governance addresses these concerns. Companies can use the tools necessary to handle big data responsibly and enable access to the right individuals. Organizations can also provide clear and transparent policies to customers, communicating data practices and what to expect.\n\nAs mentioned, customers want personalized experiences. This starts with quality data. And if we can combine that with the qualifications expected from us when it comes to building trust—like data protection and transparency—then we can create a productive data strategy.\n\nWhen we fail to govern data\n\nWhen we can no longer trust data, it becomes unreliable. We no longer have a picture of consumers, the world, and where the market is heading. Management is stuck making business decisions no longer based on information but on best guesses.\n\nBut that doesn’t have to be the case. By following foundational principles, we can avoid situations that compromise our data.\n\nData governance in the cloud era\n\nIn recent years, cloud technology has changed the data governance landscape. Depending on the infrastructure you use, data is available anywhere and everywhere. This has brought more concerns about safety, security, and management protocols.\n\nThe changes have led to more federated data governance. Unlike previous systems that centralized data, federated governance addresses the distributed nature of data in the cloud. It enables companies to manage and govern across different teams and platforms, providing flexibility, scalability, and efficiency regarding governance policies.\n\nAnother issue to consider is the involvement of non-technical teams in data governance. Non-technical staff will inevitably influence how data is managed as it becomes more accessible. Without the right system, code vulnerabilities can spark major concern.\n\nThat’s why a user-friendly no-code solution that allows users to manage data can help safeguard and empower non-technical teams to govern effectively. Clear guidelines that help govern data will also accelerate your governance strategy for better and safer results.\n\nThese fast-paced changes in modern cloud data governance require agile and adaptive systems. Unlike traditional governance, which might move slowly, contemporary governance must work quickly to adapt to changing tech and consumer expectations. Companies can adopt automated governance tools, implement continuous monitoring, and have a tighter feedback loop to adjust swiftly and respond to evolving requirements.\n\nThe four pillars of the data governance framework\n\nData governance comprises a few foundational principles, often summarized in four pillars. As a data governance team works towards efficient and secure information, they have the job of ensuring that data is organized and ready for an organization to grow and achieve its top-level priorities.\n\n1. Upholding standards and regulations\n\nTeams must ensure that all practices, regulatory requirements, and compliances are maintained and upheld.\n\nFor example, the GDPR, or the General Data Protection Regulation, is one of the strictest laws globally for data security and privacy. The EU law ensures that consumers are protected and that there is transparency on what data is being collected and what it’s being used for.\n\nWhen companies become GDPR compliant, they meet EU standards and build one of the strongest, safest foundations for their data governance journey.\n\nGDPR and other relevant compliances and regulations are essential to ensuring companies meet legal standards. Afterward, they can continue to create an above-and-beyond approach to create a safer and more transparent system for consumers. As trends and privacy expectations evolve, businesses can lead the way.\n\n2. Data quality\n\nTeams are then expected to supervise data and ensure it is authentic and reliable. Data is only as good as its quality, and companies need it to make the right decisions. Quality can be measured by preciseness, thoroughness, authenticity, timeliness, and consistency.\n\nPreciseness: Is the data correct? Can it be validated and trusted?\n\nThoroughness: Is the data complete, and does it make sense as it is? Can it be used? Is there missing information that prevents the data from telling a complete story? Is the data organized?\n\nAuthenticity: Does each piece of information accurately represent the subject or action?\n\nTimeliness: Is this data relevant to understanding present situations? Does older information add context, or is it misleading? Using this data, can we predict growing trends?\n\nConsistency: Are we gathering enough data through regular intervals, touchpoints, and actions? Are all tools in sync and integrated? Is manual labor getting in the way of collection, metrics, and analytics?\n\n3. Transparency and privacy\n\nData should be ethically managed—every involved party should know what’s collected, as well as how and what it’s used for. Managers should also make sure that these guidelines and promises are upheld.\n\n4. Data management\n\nManagement refers to the overall components of governance—the “governing” portion. While stewardship identifies who is accountable and shapes the program, data management refers to all the moving pieces of making governing possible—like how efficient, secure, and cost-effective the process is. Additionally, it includes what tools are being used and how the data is stored.\n\nData governance key roles\n\nWhile there are many roles and responsibilities within data governance (like strategic level oversight), there are a few hands-on positions.\n\nSteward: The data steward cares for the data to ensure it’s accurate and up to policy standards.\n\nManager: The data manager helps put the strategic plan into action.\n\nUser: Data users involve the team and how they perform daily tasks, interact with the data, and study sets.\n\nWhat are the challenges of maintaining data governance?\n\nEach pillar of data governance faces obstacles.\n\nIs it accurate and timely? Data teams must optimize and review how they collect and analyze data consistently. Additionally, they need parameters to evaluate expired data. If the data is no longer accurate, the team loses trust in the information, leadership makes the wrong decisions, and the organization builds data debt.\n\nIs it going to the right people, and are they using the data as they should? Data teams must decide who has access to the data, how much of it, and what they can use it for. If there are inconsistencies in the policy or if circumstances change and leadership does not follow up, companies risk irresponsible governance and vulnerabilities.\n\nWhat happens when there is an inefficiency? How is it handled? If data tools are not working right, if data isn’t organized, or if something is throwing a wrench into collection and analysis, teams need to quickly identify and solve the issue.\n\nIs the organization communicating its data policy? Teams must ensure that what data they collect and how they use it is communicated to customers, employees, and essential stakeholders. There should be transparency as data policies evolve.\n\n5 best practices to consider when managing data governance\n\n1. Choose the right team\n\nGovernance is about the right people. You need team members who are passionate about quality data and have the never-ending desire to ensure the best and most accurate information possible. Additionally, that information serves the organization and its initiatives.\n\n2. Understand it’s a process\n\nData governance is a lot like gardening. You don’t plant seedlings and then revisit them in a few months. Most of them would die. Instead, you visit, water, and care for them often. When you spot weeds, you pull them out. Data governance is a continuous process that should be treated with care and dedication.\n\n3. Set high standards and communicate expectations\n\nEnsure your team is consistently communicating. They should question how enterprise data is collected, presented, and analyzed. Team members should be able to correct issues quickly and prevent the same ones in the future.\n\n4. Know the vision\n\nThe strategy should be crystal clear. If data teams know what the business goals are, they can manage data so that it’s organized and efficient to use for the needs of the organization. If team members aren’t sure what the vision is, it creates confusion, messy data, and more difficulty in making strategic decisions.\n\n5. Invest in the right technology and data governance tools\n\nIn the data world, inefficient technology and human error can wreak havoc. That’s why choosing the right platforms and tools to help govern your data through contracts, automation, and communication is critical for creating a smooth process, reducing issues, and providing the best, most relevant information possible.\n\nGable: From reactive to preventative solutions\n\nReactive problem-solving is important. We need to be able to identify an issue and fix it to preserve data integrity and security. But it shouldn’t be the only solution.\n\nMany reactive situations can be avoided from the start.\n\nGable’s proprietary technology provides data teams with data contracts to eliminate human error and prevent issues. Instead of waiting to identify a problem once it’s already happening (and causing damage), you can stop it from happening altogether.\n\nGable’s data contracts enable you to establish data owners, set requirements for the data, and codify these nuances as version-controlled code.\n\nWe know reactive data monitoring isn’t enough. Gable ensures that alerts trigger from notifications within the CI/CD workflow. Our bot provides context to developers where they are and tags data consumers after detecting breaking changes.\n\nBy bridging the communication gap between data producers and consumers, our platform creates a more accurate, efficient solution for data.",
      "# [Data Consumers: How to Make a Meal Of Your Data](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-consumers)\nData consumers don’t bite. Honest.\n\nBut they do play increasingly vital roles in modern businesses. And their ability to deliver on behalf of the organization does depend on you keeping them well-fed—with data, that is.\n\n(Cue record-scratch.)\n\n‍\n\nData consumers are individuals, systems, and applications that access and use data to perform specific tasks or make informed decisions. As data continues to proliferate into more aspects of daily life, this definition becomes increasingly important.\n\nWhile most of us consume data by default, technical data consumers—those working in data analytics, data science, business intelligence, and the like—rely as much on the quality of data as they do its availability. This necessitates treating data as a product, with the entire organization working together to ensure the highest standards of quality are maintained over the course of the data lifecycle.\n\nThis is why it’s imperative for those working in tech-adjacent roles (e.g., managers, executives, decision-makers, and stakeholders) to understand how they can optimize for data consumers within their own organizations. But we’ll circle back to that.\n\nFirst, let’s lay a foundation by making sure we clarify what separates data producers from data consumers (and what doesn’t) in addition to covering who commonly acts as a data consumer in modern businesses.\n\nData producers vs. data consumers: As simple as it seems?\n\nIt does seem obvious. Data producers produce and/or provide data, while data consumers access and use that data. However, there are nuances to this relationship that are worth understanding. Here are some key factors, common within business environments, that can challenge the seemingly clear distinction between data production and consumption.\n\nOverlapping functions\n\nWhile often considered separately, a single entity can function as both a data producer and consumer. For example, sales teams often produce data about customer interactions, which counts as a producer role. However, it’s common for these same teams to handle the analysis of this data in order to refine their sales strategies. More generally, feedback loops within a data-savvy organization have this effect as well.\n\nData transformation\n\nTransformation of data is an instrumental part of data management. In practice, data producers may act as sources of raw data. This data then undergoes a transformation process as it’s ingested into the organization for use downstream. This can blur the line between producers and consumers in practice, as the transformation process necessitates data being consumed from one source before being delivered for use to another.\n\nVariability of data production\n\nData is produced both actively and passively. An example of active production could be the filling out of a basic web form, a deliberate act of data entry, or data generation. This could be related to customer data or personal data when individuals provide information about themselves.\n\nAn example of passive data production is how user interactions are typically logged on a social media platform or a website. These data sources often involve data collection methods that track user behavior. Whether or not data is actively or passively produced can challenge the notion of whether it’s being produced or consumed by a given data system.\n\nData stewardship and ownership\n\nGranted, data producers generate data. However, they may not have stewardship or ownership over the data produced. At the same time, data stewards who may not produce or consume data directly often play a crucial tertiary role in ensuring data quality, privacy, and security.\n\nTiming and evolution\n\nProducers and consumers of data often interact with data at different times. It’s common for data produced in real-time to be consumed in batches, or vice versa. This asynchronicity can also cloud a binary notion of who’s producing and consuming data over time.\n\nAnd, over time, the needs of data evolve as business models evolve. Meaning systems traditionally viewed as data consumers, like home appliances, can become data producers (i.e., the Internet of Things).\n\nThe basic definitions of data producers and consumers are simple enough. But as business leaders, it’s advantageous to appreciate how fluid these definitions can be in practice.\n\nWho (and what) are data consumers?\n\nWith this valuable context in mind, let’s now touch on who—and what—typically functions as a data consumer within an organization. This of course includes individuals and teams, but consumers can also be systems and applications or external entities.\n\nIndividuals and teams\n\nBusiness analysts and data scientists: Those who analyze data to extract insights, identify trends, and recommend business improvements certainly count as data consumers, as do the experts using advanced statistics, machine learning, and sheer compute to cull insights and predictions from data.\n\nSales and marketing teams: The aforementioned sales teams consume data to track sales performance, identify leads, and forecast sales trends. At the same time, marketing teams leverage data to better understand customer behavior, segment markets, measure campaign effectiveness, and, like their counterparts in sales, attempt to forecast trends.\n\nFinance, accounting, and operations teams: Key players on these teams consume data for budgeting, forecasting, financial reporting, and risk assessment analysis.\n\nOperations and supply chain teams: These teams consume data to optimize inventory and streamline operations.\n\nHuman resources (HR): Those working in human resources increasingly consume data related to recruitment trends (i.e., supply and demand), workforce analytics, and employee performance.\n\nCustomer support and service teams: High-performing contact centers rely on a constant stream of data to track service requests, evaluate customer feedback, and improve customer satisfaction.\n\nProduct managers: These roles require all available data to monitor product performance, user engagement, and identify areas of improvement.\n\nDecision makers and stakeholders: In data-driven organizations, senior leaders and managers rely on aggregated data and insights to make more productive, strategic decisions.\n\nSystems and applications\n\nBusiness intelligence tools: BI tools like Tableau, QlikView, and Power BI consume data in order to create visual representations and dashboards that analysts (also data consumers, see above) use in their work.\n\nCustomer relationship management systems: Alternatively, popular CRMs (think Salesforce and Hubspot) also consume data. Some do produce data visualizations as well, but this functionality is secondary to their primary goal of helping manage customer data and interactions.\n\nEnterprise resource planning systems: ERPs are comprehensive software solutions built to consume massive quantities of data in order to integrate various business processes and functions into a single system, one that aids in data management, process automation, reporting, analytics, and more.\n\nAutomated reporting systems: Complexity is not a prerequisite for being a data consumer, as straightforward reporting systems like NinjaOne and Alteryx consume data only as needed to aid in data preparation and report generation.\n\nData warehouses and data lakes: Typically thought of as data sources, centralized data repositories engineered to store structured and unstructured data must, by design, consume data in order to serve their purpose.\n\nMachine learning models: The algorithms driving artificial intelligence (AI) consume troves of data in order to make business-related predictions or automate decision-making processes.\n\nApplication programming interfaces: And, while APIs do not technically consume data to serve their purpose, they do get an honorable mention here since they create the pathways different systems and applications use to communicate, consume, and share data together.\n\nExternal entities\n\nPartners and affiliates: Business partners like suppliers, vendors, marketing agencies, and consulting firms often need to consume organizational data to measure joint campaign performance or align strategies.\n\nRegulatory bodies: In highly regulated industries like finance and healthcare, organizations may need to share data with regulatory authorities to ensure business operations and data management are in compliance.\n\nYour valued customers: Last but not least, digitally sophisticated customers are voracious when it comes to data consumption in the world of B2C. And, in B2B scenarios, customers are also increasingly consuming data reports and analytics as they grow both more available and accessible to less technical audiences.\n\n15 best practices to optimize your org for data consumers\n\nIn business, sadly, not all individuals get to enjoy the luxury of thinking about data management and information technology all day, every day. For those who cannot, all the information we’ve shared at this point was provided to foster an understanding and appreciation for the nuanced and varied roles consumers play in the data lifecycle.\n\nBut, often, these are the same people who have the influence and pull needed to empower a truly data-driven organization. For this reason, the following list of 15 succinct best practices is curated for those stakeholders and decision-makers who want to help set the table, so to speak.\n\nLet’s dig in:\n\n1. Engage with your data consumers\n\nOne of the best things a stakeholder can do is simple: Regularly communicate with data users in the organization. Take the time to understand the distinct requirements and challenges they face in their role.\n\nPro tip: Make constant communication easy by scheduling regular, brief check-ins with those you consider to be key data users. Quick, consistent 15-minute meetings are far more useful than longer meetings set up and attended “once in a while.”\n\n2. Treat your data as a product\n\nRestaurants live and die based on the quality of the ingredients they source. The needs and importance of your data consumers are just one of many reasons to make sure your data is of the highest possible quality, ensuring it is reliable, timely, and consistent.\n\nPro tip: The volume of data flow through even a relatively small organization is often more than can be managed manually. Work with your data leaders to implement automated data quality checks. Also, make sure that any alerts these systems use when they detect anomalies are set up to go to the right people, at the right time.\n\n3. Adopt a strong data governance framework\n\n“Data governance” can sound intense. But at its heart, governance is really just a formalized approach to defining and maintaining clear roles for data ownership and stewardship.\n\nPro tip: Robust governance is a must in today’s data-driven business world. Do your part by making sure the team or data stewards in charge are given the support and bandwidth required to succeed in their role (especially if one of those stewards will be you).\n\n4. Prioritize data security and compliance\n\nIt’s a lot harder to deal with a burglar when they’re already inside your house. Ensure that encryption, access controls, and regular audits are all in place to protect data on behalf of your consumers. It’s important to ensure everyone is up to date with regularly updated data privacy regulations specific to your organization and business model.\n\nPro tip: In partnership with your data leaders, look to leverage cloud-based solutions that include built-in security features. Doing so reduces the burdens of managing security completely in-house.\n\n5. Provide accessible data tools\n\nChampion tools and platforms for your data consumers that have earned a reputation for being highly intuitive to use. Powerful solutions that are also user-friendly encourage wide adoption, enhanced productivity, reduced training costs, and increased data accuracy.\n\nPro tip: Don’t sleep on the power of data visualization in business. BI tools in particular tend to offer dashboard capabilities that allow for quick insights without the deep dives.\n\n6. Educate and train staff\n\nData literacy should no longer be relegated to specific departments. It’s not a chore—it’s a responsibility. The health and quality of data is determined by all of its consumers, both direct and indirect. Promote this mission-critical knowledge through regular training sessions and workshops, in addition to up-to-date, accessible resources.\n\nPro tip: On-demand online training modules can drastically simplify an ongoing data literacy initiative. They serve as a means to centralize information and resources, in addition to minimizing the need for lengthy (read: costly) training sessions.\n\n7. Design for scalability and adaptability\n\nHelp ensure data systems in your organization are built to scale with the needs of your business and your data consumers.\n\nPro tip: Explore how cloud solutions can also support your ability to scale with respect to data. As these solutions grow more ubiquitous, it becomes easier to find one that can grow in sync with your business, without the need for frequent upgrades.\n\n8. Encourage cross-functional collaboration\n\nOne data-related area that firmly falls within the onus of leadership is whether or not collaborative environments are actively fostered within the organization. Optimizing for data consumption requires departments proactively working to share data and insights, and minimize data silos.\n\nPro tip: Think of inter-office communication platforms like Slack or Teams as collaboration platforms. Encourage quick, specific chats as a way of keeping your data consumers out of lengthy meetings.\n\n9. Streamline data collection processes\n\nTo ensure efficiency and reduce redundancy, normalize the ongoing automation and optimization of data collection.\n\nPro tip: Automating everything isn’t the goal. Look at where a little bit of automation will have the biggest impact. Sometimes, something as simple as utilizing APIs to pull data without manual intervention can net significant benefits.\n\n10. Iterate based on feedback\n\nThere should be no set-it-and-forget-it with organizational data management. Data processes need to be continuously refined based on the feedback you get from data consumers. More than just understanding their needs, you can play a vital role in keeping those needs met.\n\nPro tip: Business is complicated, but soliciting valuable feedback doesn’t have to be. Look to use simple feedback tools or surveys. Think about how you can reduce barriers so feedback relating to data usage is easy to give and receive.\n\n11. Stay in the know regarding data innovations\n\nLike data literacy, many people within an organization should be investing time to review emerging data-related trends through the lens of their role, experience, and skill sets. The sparks that lead to early adoption can come from anywhere. And the competitive advantages of early adoption can often prove invaluable.\n\nPro tip: Subscribe to a few industry newsletters and data-related Substacks. Just as regularly reading the trades is a must in Hollywood, use a few moments of your morning to review who’s doing what with data in your industry.\n\n12. Clarify data use cases\n\nUse cases are an excellent way to make sure specific scenarios or objectives your data consumers face align with the business’s overall goals.\n\nPro tip: It never hurts to base consumer use cases on clear business objectives. Keeping a focus on goals enables you to help streamline data processes and reduce unnecessary work.\n\n13. Leverage external data resources\n\nConsider formal partnerships or collaborations with external data sources that can enhance and complement internal data. Market trends, demographic information, and industry benchmarks can often enrich internal sales data. Analyzing data from external sources can lead to new market opportunities, potential risks, and emerging trends. And external data can be used to benchmark organizational performance against industry standards, or the competition.\n\nPro tip: Outsourcing some data needs can save time and improve data quality. But always endeavor to partner with the most reputable and trustworthy data providers.\n\n14. Document your data processes\n\nDocumentation is a critical part of maintaining high data quality. Your organization should maintain an accessible repository of all data guidelines, standards, and workflows, ensuring consistency and clarity in data practices.\n\nPro tip: To keep documentation from becoming daunting, leverage documentation tools with simple yet robust templates. Over time, these templates reduce the effort needed to update and maintain your documentation.\n\n15. Conduct regular data audits\n\nData access, usage, and quality all need to be reviewed periodically. By making data audits consistent, you’ll help identify areas of improvement while ensuring compliance.\n\nPro tip: Don’t expect your peers to party when audit time rolls around. But do work to schedule audits during less busy periods in the business. This consideration, along with keeping up a regular cadence with the audits themselves, can prevent unexpected issues and reduce stress.\n\nOrganizations are brimming with data-hungry professionals—make sure the data you source is always up to code\n\n‍\n\nWe’re still a bit in the Wild West when it comes to managing data at scale, especially with the recent rise of large language models. However, there are valuable third parties that can lend a hand through the use of data contracts. Gable.ai is transforming how data contracts work, and the data consumers in your organization deserve to benefit from what we’re cooking up in our own kitchen.",

      "# [How to Protect the Data Pipeline Process with Data Contracts](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-pipeline-process)\nThe most efficient systems may be extremely valuable and essential, but everything goes out the window when there's a vulnerability.\n\n‍\n\nTake, for instance, air travel. It’s the most efficient way to get you from Point A to Point B.\n\n‍\n\nThe passengers of Alaska Airlines would’ve agreed too, when suddenly, on January 5th, 2024, a piece of the aircraft snapped off with a bang.\n\n‍\n\nThankfully, they made it back safely, and the aircrew acted heroically to ensure everyone was safe. But it brings up an important issue.\n\n‍\n\nLike an aircraft, your data pipeline process should be accurate and protected at all times. That’s why ensuring your pipeline is safeguarded from future vulnerabilities, breakages, and interruptions is critical.\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\nFirst, we’ll define a data pipeline. Then, we’ll go over some types you can expect, steps, and benefits for data pipelines.\n\n‍\n\nFinally, we’ll learn how data contracts can help protect your data pipeline process for better accuracy and efficiency.\n\nWhat is a data pipeline?\n\nA data pipeline is how a company defines and executes how raw data moves between systems, gets verified, stored, and maintained.\n\nThe data pipeline process clarifies how we incorporate our data strategy.\n\nWhen the data is processed, it goes to the data sink for use case applications, a data warehouse for analytics, or the data lake for continued data science and machine learning.\n\nWhat types of data pipelines are there?\n\nData pipeline strategies vary based on your industry and needs. But the pipeline can be split into two types.\n\n1. Batch processing pipeline\n\nThe batch method is one of the more traditional options companies choose for enterprise data. It’s when a company processes data through fixed, predefined parameters. Your team can process larger quantities of data at a time.\n\nSince such a big data load can cause latency issues, the information is often processed during odd hours with less user activity, such as at 3 a.m.\n\nBatch processing is effective for processing lots of data that aren’t as time-sensitive. It can include historical data or metadata that could be useful in the future.\n\nBatch pipelines, however, are challenging to maintain, with systems often having to process data even if it hasn’t changed (which is a lot of work for humans and computers). Since you load volumes of data, your system will also have a knowledge gap and contain outdated information.\n\n2. Real-time or streaming processing pipeline\n\nStreaming processing pipelines are a great way to manage your data in the fast-paced world of computers and the internet.\n\nA streaming pipeline is when companies process data as it arrives, giving them low latency and current insights. Data engineers and teams can work with new data and updated datasets through automation.\n\nUnlike batch data, stream processing is constantly changing. It influences your dashboards with metrics, data analytics, and decision-making information.\n\nWhile this pipeline is very effective, it can be risky if you don’t have the right data strategy in place. You want to ensure you have the right tools and management to verify data quality and prevent hiccups as data is gathered and processed.\n\nPipelines can also include focused categories, depending on your type of business and where your data flow is. Some examples include:\n\nCloud data process: The focus on cloud-based services and how data lives, processes, and is integrated within the cloud.\n\nMachine learning process: How data is processed for machine learning (the end-to-end deployment of learning models and data preparation).\n\nData governance process: How data is governed and protected for quality, security, and compliance.\n\nWhat is ELT and ETL?\n\nAs you improve your data pipeline process, you may come across the terms ELT and ETL. They sound the same, and for the most part they are.\n\nBoth of these models focus on the order of steps for pipelines.\n\nThe initials stand for the same but place emphasis on the order:\n\nE = Extract\n\nL = Load\n\nT = Transform\n\nThey cover how data is collected, changed, and stored. These days, different pipelines can have multiple stages where ELT and ETL are involved. Often, the methods are talked about interchangeably and already function within your pipeline.\n\nELT (extract, load, and transform) might be good for a SaaS with strict rules and a critical schema to follow.\n\nOn the other hand, ETL (extract, transform, load) might be a good option to store information in your data warehouse or lake.\n\nWhat is the difference between an ETL/ELT and data pipeline?\n\nETL and ELT fall under the umbrella of your data pipeline and how you process information. While two different things, the ETL and ELT refer to your tactical steps while the pipeline encompasses the process.\n\nWhat are the benefits of a data pipeline process?\n\nData pipelines create a better way to manage your data and save you time. Below are the top advantages of a healthy process:\n\n1. Get better data quality\n\nWhen you implement a data pipeline process, you get cleaner results. The pipeline can refine the information, find and correct redundancies, and provide a usable dataset to work with.\n\n2. Make it a more efficient process\n\nData pipelines, thanks to data contracts, make it possible to automate the process. This saves thousands of hours of data engineering work. Instead, your team can use the saved time to find ways to improve your data approach or analyze the information.\n\n3. Implement a holistic approach to data\n\nThrough automation and the ability to bring your data together, your pipeline can integrate your data sources, transform data, and create a holistic product. It checks values from different sources and finds consistency errors. Additionally, it flags and corrects other common errors.\n\nWhat are the steps of the data pipeline process?\n\nETL and ELT are part of the data pipeline infrastructure. The concepts are also commonly summarized into the following:\n\n1. Data ingestion\n\nThis is when data is extracted from sources and brought to a central location for company access and analyses.\n\nThe data is often found from a source like a CRM (Salesforce, Hubspot, or Zoho). It can also come from other sources that collect data.\n\n2. Data transformation\n\nData is converted and structured to fit your system as a usable format.\n\nTransformation can take many forms. It may be the way you need data recognized, filtered, or segmented. Company pipelines may include data contracts to automatically sort and manipulate the data.\n\n‍3. Data storage\n\nFinally, your data is stored so that the company can access it and use it for business operations.\n\nIt usually arrives at a data warehouse or data lake. From there, your data team can analyze the information or use it.\n\nWhat are the benefits of Apache Kafka?\n\nApache Kafka is a popular solution for data pipeline processing. It is an open-source platform that helps manage and transform your real-time data—which is great for streaming pipelines.\n\nThere are plenty of benefits to using Apache Kafka.\n\nIt’s open-sourced, which means you can build your own solutions or partner with a third party to create a custom fit for your company.\n\nIt’s fast and scalable, so you can process data immediately across many servers.\n\nIt’s durable with Apache Kafka’s ability to provide intra-cluster replication.\n\nIt has high performance, even when dealing with large amounts of data.\n\nHow do data contracts support pipelines?\n\nData is only as good as its accuracy. The minute it’s compromised, you can’t trust it. Your business decisions, customer behavior analytics, and planning are now done in the dark.\n\nThankfully, we now have the technology to prevent data pipeline issues before they happen.\n\nYou no longer have to worry about a problem after that fact, you can rely on data contracts to execute smooth processes and eliminate avoidable mistakes.\n\nData contracts define the structure, format, and criteria for data as it is extracted, transformed, and stored. It eliminates human error and can find issues before they become a problem.\n\nData contracts automate your pipeline for a smoother, more accurate data process and workflow.\n\nData contracts for a better pipeline process\n\nWhen you think of a literal pipeline that moves water, it’s a powerful force. It’s efficient, it moves fast, and it can push the resource to its destination.\n\nWhere pipelines might depend on water pressure, gravity, and energy to function properly, your data pipeline needs its power source too.\n\nData contracts move, transform, and store your information efficiently through automatic processes. Choosing the right solution provides the power source to make it possible.\n\nGable automatically generates contract templates, manages contract versioning, and enforces contracts using a variety of alerting thresholds.\n\nYou can collaborate with data engineers, data scientists, and software engineers to create and modify contracts over time.\n\nWith Gable, you can prevent breaking changes programmatically and alert consumers when contract updates will impact them. You can manage contract versions and evolution simply and easily.\n\nIt’s perfect for your data pipeline process, especially if you want to take control of your data management and use your information to its full potential—so you can grow your company with secure, reliable, and efficient data.",
      "# [3 Data Contract Types and Examples](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-contract-example)\nIn the wake of the tsunami of big data, it would seem we’re entering the era of the data contract.\n\nData contracts are formal agreements similar in spirit to service-level agreements (SLAs). They are drafted and enforced to ensure that the data products an organization relies on are of high quality, meeting the needs of both data producers and data consumers. This makes data contracts an increasingly essential aspect of modern data management.\n\n‍\n\nThis is why it’s important for data professionals to understand more than just the theory behind data contracts.\n\nThe right data contract examples provide context on the difference they make in the real world. This enables more data leaders to advocate for their use.\n\nSchema, semantics, and metadata: 3 key responsibilities of the data contract\n\n“The power of data contracts is that they're designed to unite teams and disciplines across an entire company, while also integrating seamlessly into the individual tools and workflows at all stages of the data lifecycle.” — Data Contracts: Building Production Grade Pipelines at Scale (O’Reilly, 2024)\n\nThe heart of every data contract lies in three core responsibilities: schema, semantics, and metadata.\n\nTogether, these components ensure that data assets are properly structured, business logic is consistently applied, and metadata maintains data quality and traceability throughout the entire data lifecycle.\n\n1. Schema\n\nData contracts enforce schema rules that define data types, ensuring consistency and preventing invalid data from entering the system. By using data representation standards like JSON Schema or YAML, data teams can codify the required structure, types, and constraints of a given dataset to ensure data consistency and quality.\n\nFor example, imagine a data contract drafted to support a subscription-based fitness service called CryptoCrunch. Let’s say this platform connects fitness tracking devices to user accounts, capturing data like workout performance, energy expenditure, and biometric data.\n\n(For fun, let’s also imagine CryptoCrunch’s user base creates biometric energy by doing intense core-related exercises to offset the fossil fuel energy required for Bitcoin mining. Because why not?)\n\nIn this (objectively awesome) example, a JSON Schema could define a contract for a CryptoCrunch database table containing user information, ensuring that every record has a valid email address and a non-empty customer ID. Data contracts can enforce these rules in near real-time during data ingestion. Alternatively, they can enforce data quality rules as part of CI/CD workflows to catch schema violations early in the data pipeline.\n\nNote: YAML is often used alongside JSON Schema because it provides a more human-readable format, making it easier for teams to define and review schema specifications.\n\n2. Semantics\n\nIn addition to enforcing schema, data contracts define clear rules for data producers, ensuring that the data they generate meets the expected standards before moving downstream. This includes the business logic that defines how data consumers and other stakeholders should interpret and use data in the specific context of the organization.\n\nFor example, in the CryptoCrunch platform, a data contract might define a \"workout session\" as a set of core-related exercises that generates a certain amount of biometric energy. The business logic could specify that a valid workout session must last at least 30 minutes and generate a minimum amount of energy to qualify for Bitcoin mining offsets.\n\nSemantic rules like these are critical for maintaining consistency, especially when data is transformed or shared across teams, such as customer service, analytics, and data engineering. If CryptoCrunch expands its service to include partnerships with other energy-efficient platforms, these contracts would ensure that everyone downstream is using data that reflects these specific business rules.\n\nBy embedding this business logic directly into the data contract, the platform ensures that teams responsible for workout performance analytics or energy expenditure tracking always work with data that aligns with organizational expectations. This reduces the risk of errors or inconsistencies and ensures that the data correctly reflects user activities and energy credits.\n\n3. Metadata\n\nThe third key responsibility of data contracts involves managing metadata, which is essential for maintaining consistency and traceability across datasets. Metadata typically includes details such as when the data was created, how it has been processed or transformed since its creation, and who owns or is responsible for it.\n\nThis metadata management is a crucial part of data governance, with data contracts ensuring that data quality, consistency, and ownership are enforced across the organization. By codifying these governance rules into contracts, organizations can ensure that data adheres to defined quality standards before those organizations progress through a data pipeline or the data lifecycle.\n\nFor example, CryptoCrunch metadata might track important details such as when a user's workout data was generated, how much energy was expended during the session, and whether that energy was successfully converted into Bitcoin mining offsets. Additionally, the metadata would indicate who “owns” the data—whether it’s linked to an individual user’s account or aggregated for system-wide energy consumption reports.\n\nBy managing this metadata, the CryptoCrunch data contract would ensure that each user’s workout data adheres to the platform’s quality standards before being processed to generate energy credits or used in performance analytics. This process ensures that any issues are addressed before the data moves further down the CryptoCrunch pipeline, maintaining both data integrity and governance.\n\nData contract examples: Enforcing quality and consistency\n\n“It’s not a matter of if a data issue will arise, but rather a matter of when, and increased scope leads to an increased probability of issues being highlighted.”​ — Data Contracts: Building Production Grade Pipelines at Scale (O’Reilly, 2024)\n\nIt’s an understatement to say that data contracts are universally beneficial to all data-dependent organizations.\n\nBut certain use cases and applications highlight the value of data contracts more definitively than others, like analytics databases, transactional databases, and event streaming.\n\nExample 1: Analytics databases\n\nAnalytics databases, such as data warehouses or data lakes, often aggregate immense amounts of data from multiple sources. As these databases grow, maintaining data quality becomes more difficult, especially when new datasets are introduced or existing data sources evolve.\n\nLeft unchecked, schema changes that break downstream processes can have chaotic repercussions:\n\nCorrupted reporting and analytics: When even a seemingly simple schema change is not enforced or caught early, it can lead to errors in reporting, analytics dashboards, and even machine learning models. Imagine a basic yet key field in a database like \"total sales\" being altered or removed. Dashboards that data consumers rely upon downstream might then display misleading data or fail entirely.\n\nIncreased business decision risks: Analytics databases are commonly used to derive insights that inform business strategy. Therefore, incorrect or incomplete data can hamstring data-driven decision-making. In these instances, stakeholders and executives might base their actions on misleading information—like underestimating product demand or making incorrect financial projections—which could then result in lost revenue, flawed campaign strategies, or reputational damage to the organization itself.\n\nLonger debugging and fixing cycles: Without data contracts to enforce schema validation, engineers and data scientists can get left on the hook, spending considerable time manually troubleshooting why certain processes are failing. This can bog down (or outright stall) critical business operations and divert resources from more valuable tasks.\n\nOn these modern data platforms, however, data contracts enforce quality across multiple data sources, ensuring that downstream analytics remain accurate. Tools like dbt (data build tool) integrate with data contracts to ensure that transformations performed on analytics databases follow schema and business logic rules.\n\nBy enforcing schema consistency, changes to a dataset’s structure (e.g., adding new columns or renaming an existing column) cannot break mission-critical downstream analytics processes like dashboards or machine learning models.\n\nThis does more than keep organizational data pipelines running smoothly. Data contracts ensure that all insights and reports derived from upstream databases are, and will remain, accurate.\n\nExample 2: Transactional databases\n\nTransactional databases—think those used in ecommerce or customer management systems (CMS)—deliver value by capturing and processing real-time operational data. When taken as a whole, this immense amount of data, order information, payment information, and customer profiles are often leveraged in the aggregate to become a single source of truth for core business functions.\n\nAs such, this data must remain exceptionally consistent over time for business models to improve. Data inconsistencies, then, create issues that naturally eat into this “truth” that business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) companies must rely on:\n\nBilling errors and financial loss: At the most basic level, severe financial issues can occur if the data used for transactions is inconsistent or inaccurate. Take a business shifting from a B2C to B2B model. If its data schema is not updated to handle corporate accounts, invoices could then be sent to incorrect entities or with the wrong amounts, resulting in significant revenue loss or legal disputes.\n\nOperational disruptions: Since transactional databases often serve as the backbone for retail businesses, business logic needs to be enforced properly. When it isn’t, this can disrupt operations as a whole—from inventory and order fulfillment to customer management. When this happens, business operations may halt completely, leading to costly delays.\n\nCustomer relationship damage: There’s often more than money on the line, as inaccurate customer data can result in poor service or communication. Imagine, due to operational disruptions, orders are delayed or delivered to incorrect addresses. Then customer service representatives who are given outdated or incorrect information are expected to resolve these issues. It becomes easy to see how negative reviews and customer churn would quickly impact an organization’s brand, not just its bottom line.\n\nThat said, changes of this sort are exceptionally common in B2B and B2C organizations, as businesses naturally evolve and expand. The data contract is what keeps business growth on track, enforcing business logic and ensuring data remains consistent with a given business's needs.\n\nBy defining clear rules, data contracts help manage dependencies between various data assets, ensuring that changes in one area do not disrupt downstream processes. Additionally, in this example, contracts also ensure ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance, maintaining data consistency and accuracy as business models evolve, while minimizing the risk of data corruption in critical systems.\n\nExample 3: Event streaming\n\nEvent-driven systems handle real-time data and can involve complex interactions, such as user activity tracking, IoT device data, or financial transactions.\n\nAs these systems mature and gain further adoption, and the subsequent volume and velocity of data increase proportionally, ensuring data consistency becomes a significant challenge, especially in distributed systems.\n\nThis is what makes event-driven systems particularly vulnerable to real-time data inconsistencies—race conditions, event duplication, etc. And, unfortunately, it doesn’t take a big inconsistency to cause major problems in the moment:\n\nData integrity breakdown: As mentioned, inconsistencies can lead to corrupted data in real-time systems, especially those relying on event-driven architectures (that is, systems where the outcome of an event depends on the sequence or timing of events that occur simultaneously or close together). This could be as simple as the processing of a cancellation order that hasn’t yet been placed. It’s a hiccup, but one that could leave a system in an incorrect state, or one that leads to incorrect information downstream, further undermining data integrity.\n\nOperational latency and failures: Event streaming often requires low-latency processing to handle high volumes of data in real time. Without data contracts enforcing data quality and structure, invalid or malformed events can slow down processing pipelines, cause failures in real-time applications, and lead to delayed responses. In industries like finance or telecommunications, these delays could lead to missed opportunities or regulatory violations.\n\nCritical system outages: If event streaming systems break down due to inconsistent or corrupt data, it can lead to larger system outages. For instance, a streaming service that relies on real-time telemetry data for monitoring system health could be blind to performance issues, resulting in prolonged downtime or service degradation that affects customers and revenue.\n\nIn event streaming, data contracts enforce structure and data quality rules when APIs transfer real-time data across systems. By doing so, the contract ensures that event information (such as user updates or financial transactions) remains valid and consistent, regardless of how many times it is processed.\n\nWhile the streaming infrastructure handles event sequencing, data contracts prevent issues like corrupt data or out-of-schema events from being processed, preserving data quality and reliability in distributed environments.\n\nFrom examples to education: Working together to draft a better way forward\n\n“What makes data contracts powerful is what also makes them difficult to implement. The power of data contracts is that they're designed to unite teams and disciplines across an entire company, while also integrating seamlessly into the individual tools and workflows at all stages of the data lifecycle.” — Data Contracts: Building Production Grade Pipelines at Scale (O’Reilly, 2024)\n\nOn its own, this quote encapsulates the inherent challenge of data contracts. It does, however, also tip a hat toward the solution: education and advocacy.\n\nData contracts are indeed powerful. In addition to the practical examples in this article, they also have the power to unify various teams and disciplines within an organization around common data standards and expectations.\n\nBut this exceptional integrativeness can be hampered by challenges with data contract implementation and support—let alone buy-in from organizational leadership and stakeholders, each with competing priorities and knowledge bases.\n\nSo, alignment is key for unleashing the benefits that data contracts can (and should) provide for data teams worldwide. Which brings us back to the quote, and those featured throughout the article. Truth be told, the book they’re all from—Data Contracts: Building Production Grade Pipelines at Scale—is, actually, the very first book from Gable.ai.\n\nWritten by our own Chad Sanderson and Mark Freeman (and published by our awesome friends at O’Reilly), the book is our sincere attempt to help spark more education and advocacy amongst our data engineering peers. We’d love for you to grab your own free copy, as soon as it’s available. Especially if you believe in the power data contracts can and do have in modern organizations, but maybe sometimes struggle to articulate exactly how.\n\nThat said, we’re still a few weeks away from our publishing date. But don’t panic. You can already download the first few chapters to get an edge on your co-workers downstream.\n\nEnjoy! We can’t wait to hear what you think."

Insurance carriers got sick of this, and just start dropping people when their roof gets over certain age, or if it's in a certain condition.\n\nSo basically the storm chaser roofers won.  For a lot of carriers you must change your shingle roof every 15 years, regardless of the shape it's in.\n\n#### Comment ID k0gie5d with +27 score by [(Youre10PlyBud, Reddit, 2023-09-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roofing/comments/16hetjg/my_home_insurance_is_dropping_me_because_of/k0gie5d/) (in reply to ID k0fy2wv):\nThey're going beyond roofs in a lot of places.

We made a claim since some of our solar panels took a beating.  Tennis ball-size hail at the speed of gravity will have that effect, if you throw enough ice balls at the panels.  \n\nState Farm sent their people over - they had a team up here since there were a lot of claims.  Looked at our 25-ish year old steel roof and decided it also got damaged in the storm.  Beyond a bunch of dents (builds character) it's functioning fine.  I don't care about the dents - nobody looks at them except us.  \n\nNope.  They're forking out a boatload to do 9,000 sf of steel roof on the house and shop building, along with some siding that could be replaced for a few thousand with labor.  Gutters, too.  And the garden shed that has a steel roof and siding.  The claim amount is just over 1/3 what we paid for the place in 2016.  The roofing contractor - same folks who installed it way back when - says it's functionally fine (even though they have a financial interest in replacing it).  I suppose SF could drop us if we don't make the repairs, so I guess we'll be picking out a new roof color.  \n\nAll we wanted was replacement of the solar panels and a little more for some minor siding damage.\n\n#### Comment ID k0h7i1j with +1 score by [(UpUpWeGo21, Reddit, 2023-09-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roofing/comments/16hetjg/my_home_insurance_is_dropping_me_because_of/k0h7i1j/) (in reply to ID k0ga000):\nI worked on the contractor side and have helped people get a lot of things replaced from storm damages \nLegit damage I've never told anyone to file a claim if they didn't have any damage\nBut the age of the roof doesn't affect it being replaced because of storm damages. \nIn fact it's easier to get those replaced because after a certain point you can't repair without causing more damage so they are forced to replace\n\n### Comment ID k0gcvrq with +2 score by [(code-brown, Reddit, 2023-09-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roofing/comments/16hetjg/my_home_insurance_is_dropping_me_because_of/k0gcvrq/) (in reply to ID k0e9ofu):\nWe are having a new roof installed as I type this for this exact reason.

The loss of granules, or hail damage for that matter cannot be properly identified without physically being on the roof. This is why most carriers do not accept drone inspections. I would absolutely insist on an in-person assessment of your roof. Find the contact info for your state’s insurance commissioner, and file a complaint if the carrier refuses.\n\n### Comment ID k0fx2pb with +11 score by [(Kuros_Of_Sindarin, Reddit, 2023-09-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roofing/comments/16hetjg/my_home_insurance_is_dropping_me_because_of/k0fx2pb/) (in reply to ID k0fflmf):\nThis would be a giant waste of time.

White area looks newer, likely the area that was replaced, the brown area has plenty of issues present. I have been witnessing insurance carriers dropping people in any hurricane area trying to reduce their exposure in these states. I subcontract to about a dozen carriers on any given year. They are using any excuse in the book, and most of them are as flimsy as this. Your first photo shows lifted shingles all over which is likely related to nail pops. It happens, sometimes a little sometimes a lot. The curling at the eaves is usually do to poor sheathing coverage at the eaves, sometimes due to rot at the eaves, sometimes both. They will assume rot and maintenance issues and drop you. I would replace your back slope, address the sheathing, and get new insurance asap. Insurance with a roof less than 3 years old will be simple. You can lawyer up but realize that it’s throwing good money after bad. Almost every carrier is trying to shrink their exposure. Lawyers suing for everything is why. They will fight for your cause but it’s not a winning one in this case. People think that everything is an insurance claim, lawyers telling them that is sure is… just to get the lawsuit going. Well it’s not, but the consumer protections are too favorable for the consumer which means it’s easy to get a concession from the insurance company. Which is considered a win for the lawyer, and in most states that means the carrier has to pay all lawyer fees. So you may feel you get a win, a new roof slope or get something covered that was related to rot (never covered). You get 2/5/20k in repairs you shouldn’t have, but the Lawyers bill for 20/40/60k and you never see it or know about it. I watch claims for a simple 25k roof replacement hit 100-200k constantly all due to lawyers and PAs. That’s what’s destroying our home rates.  \n\nI’m much more a fan of Canadian insurance methods. They fix your home and you cannot sue. It means they get to focus on fixing correctly and not have to defend against nuisance lawsuits. Contractors fix what’s broken and get paid directly in most cases.\n\n### Comment ID k0f0s5b with +3 score by [(Ghinasucks, Reddit, 2023-09-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roofing/comments/16hetjg/my_home_insurance_is_dropping_me_because_of/k0f0s5b/) (in reply to ID k0e0kgo):\nBingo!\n\n### Comment ID k0ge6d0 with +3 score by [(sbarrio2, Reddit, 2023-09-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roofing/comments/16hetjg/my_home_insurance_is_dropping_me_because_of/k0ge6d0/) (in reply to ID k0e0kgo):\nPublic adjusters, lawyers, and shady contractors are parasites that will be the death of affordable and accessible insurance.

There is zero reason to start with a lawsuit if your repairs are being made in a timely manner. You could replace 10 roofs for the cost of one lawsuit. Standards would be in every consumers favor if your average person stop being sheeple and carriers did right the first time, and lawyers didn’t have the ability to enrich themselves by preying on the ignorant.

Also, there's no requirement the company give time to replace. Renewal notices are heavily regulated in the number of days mailing notice they must give prior to the upcoming renewal date.  Assuming they met that, they're good.\n\nWhat the OP should be doing right now is get serious about replacing the roof and call the company to see if they'd renew with a new roof. If so, get a new roof. One is needed anyways: that slope is in piss-poor, decrepit condition.  That roof is either already leaking or will leak very soon.  Guaranteed if not replaced the OP won't be able to find another carrier, especially when they find out the policy was nonrenewed and why.\n\nAn insurance policy is not a maintenance contract.

My dad had his insurance dropped from his house because is some paint that started to peel in a section of the house that was like 12’ long and a small exterior spall in the concrete footing under the chimney that was about 4” long by less than an inch tall and at the deepest part was about 3/4”. But here is the real kicker all of the insurance companies use the same program so once one puts something in there, they all see that you are being dropped and you can not get coverage from any other company because they pull you up and site the same exact reason you are being dropped as the reason they can not cover you. Furthermore, what you also may have not realized, this may also force you to default on your mortgage. Like auto loans, the home loan is contingent on you having home owners insurance. If they drop you, you will no longer have the insurance and default on the loan. \n\nI think it is a way for the insurance companies to drop a bunch of their cheaper homes that they are covering , and later will cover your home, but as it is and at a much higher rate. Anything breaks, it is on you now, it is not covered under the new policy.

Contractors take then on because it opens the door to sell things to the homeowner that aren't covered by insurance or to upsell the homeowners from whatever is covered. It's quite possible that the contractor they hired saw that the roof was good and made up some bullshit in the hopes that they could convince you or the insurance company to buy a new roof. The insurance company saw the quote didn't look at the pictures and just dropped you.

Nope, people are still dumb enough to buy the metal roofs with the full knowledge it will have to be replaced no matter condition in 15 years.

Its users link content created elsewhere, effectively siphoning value from  \nother sources via its users.\n2. Its users create new content specifically for it, thus profiting of off the  \nfree labour and content made by its users\n\nThis means that Reddit creates no value but exploits its users to generate the  \nvalue that uses to sell advertisements, charge its users for meaningless tokens,  \nsell NFTs, and seek private investment. Reddit relies on volunteer moderation by  \npeople who receive no benefit, not thanks, and definitely no pay. Reddit is  \nprofiting entirely off all of its users doing all of the work from gathering  \nlinks, to making comments, to moderating everything, all for free. Reddit is\nalso going to sell your information, you data, your content to third party AI\ncompanies so that they can train their models on your work, your life, your\ncontent and Reddit can make money from it, all while you see nothing in return.\n\n## Lack of respect for its third party developers\n\nI'm sure everyone at this point is familiar with the API changes putting many  \nthird party application developers out of business. Reddit saw how much money  \nentities like OpenAI and other data scraping firms are making and wants a slice  \nof that pie, and doesn't care who it tramples on in the process. Third party  \ndevelopers have created tools that make the use of Reddit far more appealing and  \nfeasible for so many people, again freely creating value for the company, and  \nit doesn't care that it's killing off these initiatives in order to take some of  \nthe profits it thinks it's entitled to.\n\n## Lack of respect for other cultures\n\nReddit spreads and enforces right wing, libertarian, US values, morals, and  \nethics, forcing other cultures to abandon their own values and adopt American  \nones if they wish to provide free labour and content to a for profit American  \ncorporation. American cultural hegemony is ever present and only made worse by  \ncompanies like Reddit actively forcing their values and social mores upon  \nforeign cultures without any sensitivity or care for local values and customs.  \nMeanwhile they allow reprehensible ideologies to spread through their network  \nunchecked because, while other nations might make such hate and bigotry illegal,  \nReddit holds \"Free Speech\" in the highest regard, but only so long as it doesn't  \noffend their own American sensibilities.\n\n## Lack for respect for the truth\n\nReddit has long been associated with disinformation, conspiracy theories,  \nastroturfing, and many such targeted attacks against the truth. Again protected  \nunder a veil of \"Free Speech\", these harmful lies spread far and wide using  \nReddit as a base. Reddit allows whole deranged communities and power-mad  \nmoderators to enforce their own twisted world-views, allowing them to silence  \ndissenting voices who oppose the radical, and often bigoted, vitriol spewed by  \nthose who fear leaving their own bubbles of conformity and isolation.\n\n## Lack of respect for common decency\n\nReddit is full of hate and bigotry. Many subreddits contain casual exclusion,  \ndiscrimination, insults, homophobia, transphobia, racism, anti-semitism,  \ncolonialism, imperialism, American exceptionalism, and just general edgy hatred.  \nReddit is toxic, it creates, incentivises, and profits off of \"engagement\" and  \n\"high arousal emotions\" which is a polite way of saying \"shouting matches\" and  \n\"fear and hatred\".\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf not for ideological reasons then at least leave Reddit for personal ones. Do  \nYou enjoy endlessly scrolling Reddit? Does constantly refreshing your feed bring  \nyou any joy or pleasure? Does getting into meaningless internet arguments with  \nstrangers on the internet improve your life? Quit Reddit, if only for a few  \nweeks, and see if it improves your life.\n\nI am leaving Reddit for good. I urge you to do so as well.\n\n### Comment ID e98lq6b with +17 score by [(coebruh, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e98lq6b/) (in reply to ID e98kx3o):\nOh, you know we do!\n\n## Comment ID e9816yd with +39 score by [(DeadKittyPool, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e9816yd/) (in reply to ID 9uulai):\nFrankly, I've never felt voting to be all that essential to the process.\n\n### Comment ID e983dk9 with +32 score by [(giaaeron, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e983dk9/) (in reply to ID e9816yd):\nNo kidding, Ford.\n\n#### Comment ID e98rftb with +5 score by [(sumppumpslump, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e98rftb/) (in reply to ID e983dk9):\nHi my name's Gerry and I like movies\n\n## Comment ID e98hwmc with +10 score by [(CannibalRed, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e98hwmc/) (in reply to ID 9uulai):\nIs everyone enjoying their FREE BEER!\n\n## Comment ID e98s9kl with +7 score by [(GolemThe3rd, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e98s9kl/) (in reply to ID 9uulai):\nAccourding to Moores law a computer in the year 3000 should be 2^684.66 times faster than one in 1973 (yes I know this is impossible, but its interesting)\n\n### Comment ID e98zr0z with +3 score by [(UnfetteredThoughts, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e98zr0z/) (in reply to ID e98s9kl):\nShame Moore's Law is breaking down already.\n\n## Comment ID e98tkan with +5 score by [(CheckersSpeech, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e98tkan/) (in reply to ID 9uulai):\nAt any rate, I *certainly* wouldn't harm the child.   \n\n*[Truthoscope goes nuts]*\n\n## Comment ID e98tmub with +6 score by [(CheckersSpeech, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e98tmub/) (in reply to ID 9uulai):\nPuny Human #1, Puny Human #2 ... and Morbo's good friend Richard Nixon!\n\n## Comment ID e98tek8 with +4 score by [(CheckersSpeech, Reddit, 2018-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/9uulai/nixon_is_in_my_head_tonight/e98tek8/) (in reply to ID 9uulai):\nNixon's back!

Anything bigger than 7x7 is gonna be really hard to decorate, unless it's divided somehow or in a unique shape.\n\nAlso, have a rough plan of what rooms you want in your house before you actually make it. It makes actually building the house a lot easier, and prevents you from running into creative blocks (most of the time).\n\nDon't use bright white for lights. If you're making a normal house, use a color like burlap or linen instead. If you're making a public building or some other kind of facility, use an off white instead. Using a bright white light for every light makes your build look like a star exploding, so please save your time (that you would spend recoloring the lights) and just color them an off white.\n\n### Comment ID k9wzijn with +12 score by [(Tarasbys, Reddit, 2023-11-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bloxburg/comments/17z23ly/whats_one_building_mistake_people_should/k9wzijn/) (in reply to ID k9wxc7x):\nStrong on the 1st one.

However, it's the best tool currently out there (although Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro is likely to give it a run for the money), and if you were specifically looking for an AI tool, that's the one I'd both use and recommend to use.\n\n### Comment ID kr4xqt8 with +1 score by [(hpsims, Reddit, 2024-02-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1auh7ja/is_chatgpt_premium_worth_it/kr4xqt8/) (in reply to ID kr3wvhn):\nDo you need copilot for this?

      "# Post ID zorgoj: I asked an AI language model to create a narrative appraisal report. How did it do? with +4 score by [(Variaxist, Reddit, 2022-12-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/appraisal/comments/zorgoj/i_asked_an_ai_language_model_to_create_a/)\nwhat specific other details would you include/not include? I've only ever written form reports. It really seems to have hit all the high notes to me.\n\n>The subject property is located at 123 Main Street in Anytown, USA. It is a single-family, ranch-style home with three bedrooms and two bathrooms. The home was built in 1960 and has a gross living area of 1,500 square feet. The property sits on a lot of 0.25 acres and has a two-car attached garage.  \n>  \n>The exterior of the home is in good condition, with vinyl siding and a newer roof. The roof was replaced in 2018 with a dimensional shingle that has a 50-year lifespan. The landscaping is well-maintained, with mature trees and shrubs. The driveway is in good condition and is made of concrete. It leads to the attached garage, which has automatic doors and is large enough to fit two vehicles.  \n>  \n>The interior of the home is also in good condition, with recently updated finishes and appliances. The living room is spacious and features a fireplace and large windows. The fireplace is made of brick and has a wood-burning insert. The windows are double-paned and have been updated within the last 5 years. The kitchen is modern and includes granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, and a breakfast bar. The appliances are all Energy Star rated, which can help to lower utility costs. The three bedrooms are all of good size and have ample closet space. The master bedroom has a walk-in closet and a private bathroom. The two bathrooms have been recently renovated with new fixtures and finishes. The master bathroom has a double vanity and a walk-in shower, while the guest bathroom has a tub/shower combination.  \n>  \n>Overall, the subject property presents as a well-maintained and updated home in a desirable location. The home has a functional layout and has been updated with modern finishes and appliances. It is located in a quiet neighborhood with easy access to local amenities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>In the second part of this narrative appraisal report, we will provide a thorough analysis of the subject property's market value. The subject property is a single-family residential home located at 123 Main Street in Anytown, USA. It is situated on a 0.25 acre lot and features a 1,800 square foot floor plan with three bedrooms and two bathrooms.  \n>  \n>Upon arriving at the property, we observed that it is a well-maintained, ranch-style home with a brick exterior and a gable roof. The property also has a two-car attached garage and a fenced-in backyard.  \n>  \n>During our interior inspection of the property, we found that it has been recently renovated and features updated finishes throughout. The kitchen has new granite countertops and stainless steel appliances, and the bathrooms have been upgraded with new fixtures and tile work. The home also has new flooring and paint throughout.  \n>  \n>Additionally, the property has several amenities that contribute to its market value. These include a fireplace in the living room, a sunroom off the back of the house, and a finished basement with a recreation room and a den.  \n>  \n>Based on our analysis of the subject property, we believe that it is a well-maintained, updated home that is in good condition. The property's location and amenities also contribute to its market value. We will now proceed to compare the subject property to similar properties in the area to determine its fair market value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The third part of this detailed narrative appraisal report focuses on the analysis and conclusion of value for the subject property.  \n>  \n>After careful review and analysis of the subject property and the selected comparable sales, it is the opinion of the appraiser that the most likely sale price for the subject property as of the effective date of the appraisal would be $375,000. This value was determined through the use of the sales comparison approach, which involves comparing the features and characteristics of the subject property to those of similar properties that have recently sold in the area. The resulting value was then adjusted for any differences between the subject property and the comparables, as well as for any market conditions that may have affected value.  \n>  \n>It is important to note that this value represents the most likely sale price of the property if it were to be sold on the open market in an arm's length transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller. It is not a determination of the property's value for any other purpose, such as financing or taxation.  \n>  \n>In conclusion, the subject property is a well-maintained, single-family residence located in a desirable neighborhood with easy access to amenities and transportation. Based on the analysis and comparison to similar properties, it is the opinion of the appraiser that the most likely sale price for the subject property as of the effective date of the appraisal is $375,000.\n\n## Comment ID j0ona63 with +17 score by [(NorCalRushfan, Reddit, 2022-12-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/appraisal/comments/zorgoj/i_asked_an_ai_language_model_to_create_a/j0ona63/) (in reply to ID zorgoj):\nZoning, highest and best use, neighborhood market description and analysis, reconciliation of the three methods of valuation, subject market segment description and analysis all seem to be missing.\n\nThat said, the writing is much better than I typically see in appraisals too.\n\n## Comment ID j0oncux with +14 score by [(NorCalRushfan, Reddit, 2022-12-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/appraisal/comments/zorgoj/i_asked_an_ai_language_model_to_create_a/j0oncux/) (in reply to ID zorgoj):\n\"Desirable\" is a no no word.

Similar to a Viking in a sense, where he fights with reckless abandon, but he won’t roll over and die, he wants whoever kills him to EARN the kill. However the difference is that Io isn’t comforted by the fact that he’ll die gloriously or will go to Valhalla, he just wants to die so he can achieve piece from all the fighting. \n\nI think this is showcased well when he’s talking to all the kids in the first movie, basically calling them cannon-fodder so he can achieve his mission, without showing a shred of discomfort that he’s leading literally dozens of kids to death. You have to be so depressed or fucked in the head to do that.

The FA-78 isn't the f91 or unicorn, there's no psycho frame, no bio sensor, it's just the learning computer (which considering how short it lived probably didn't learn much) like on the regular rx-78 and the pilot interface. The fact that lo was able to pilot it to great success and also hit what he was aiming at is a testament to him being a fantastic pilot. The fact that zeons living dead division had to not only dismember one of their own pilots but create a nerve based interface on a mobile suit just to keep from being exterminated is a testament to lo.

I don't like HIM, we aren't supposed to, but I love how he is written.\n\n### Comment ID jexxsl9 with +3 score by [(ralpren, Reddit, 2023-04-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/12bhi4s/a_lot_of_my_friends_think_that_io_fleming_is_a/jexxsl9/) (in reply to ID jexhyka):\nIceman in Top Gun was clinical, perfect, and won through wearing the other guy down, and survived by being better and knowing his situation.  \n\n\nIf you're gunna give it a Top Gun reference, Io is Hollywood.

The duel didn't really have an outcome because it was interrupted, but it clearly shows that Io can give Daryl —who is using a ground type Psycho Zaku that can easily waltz through GMs— a hard time with his Atlas. \n\nWhat actually hampered him as a pilot is his ego and how troubled he is as a person.

Kind of cryptic as Tomino explanations always go, but I think what it means is that Amuro is never going to escape the old mindset of the \"person\" being contained within an individual - whereas Kamille's mind and identity basically expanded to the whole of space. IIRC he also said that he'd pick Judau if he were to pick one of them to write a sequel about, since he had the energy and stamina to hold up another show as a protagonist.\n\n#### Comment ID jsrx8zv with +8 score by [(ShortBus_Sheriff, Reddit, 2023-07-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/154ufpz/who_do_you_consider_the_most_technically_skilled/jsrx8zv/) (in reply to ID jsrbyam):\nJudau would have been nice to see again\n\n### Comment ID jstasct with +8 score by [(hdorsettcase, Reddit, 2023-07-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/154ufpz/who_do_you_consider_the_most_technically_skilled/jstasct/) (in reply to ID jsr4lin):\nCCA Amuro is an absolutely amazing pilot who can take  full advantage of a mobile suit.

Suletta probably ranks fairly high.\n\nWhy? Before the series starts she's been piloting Aerial for at least 6yrs (Cradel Planet has her doing a colony rescue at around age 11), and has been brought up learning how to pilot/playing in the cockpit since a young age. Granted she may not have wartime experience but near a decade of piloting experience. Can quickly calculate travel time in her head, used a beam saber at a low powered mode like a scalpel and that's all before she got to the school.\n\nDuring her time at the school she expands on these skills, beating the top ranked 'fighter' at the school as well as many, many others. She ends up with the Holder title and only loses it because of outside interference, even after taking on multiple consecutive/endurance fights. \n\nThen you have her in the Caliburn, under significant physical distress, actively dodging probably the most OP suit in Witch while also fighting against a small army (granted we don't see full numbers of this) of drones and only taking a few kicks\\*.   \n\n\nFrom a skill level she's up there, even if she doesn't have a high kill-count. That decade of experience prior to the series start is more than most pilots from other AU's have in total.\n\n  \n\\*yes an argument can be made that neither of the combatants are actually trying to hurt each other.\n\n### Comment ID jsr49zz with +27 score by [(JumpingVillage3, Reddit, 2023-07-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/154ufpz/who_do_you_consider_the_most_technically_skilled/jsr49zz/) (in reply to ID jsqsdp9):\nWfM has a lot of talented pilots. El5n kept up with gundvolvas and a GUND-formatted Norea (who later fights toe to toe with Kenanji) without activating the Pharact's greatest weapons, mobility features and being under gravity which it wasn't necessarily designed for. Guel constantly fought Gundams in way worse mobile suits and had some level of advantage, even pushing Lauda to use the GUND-Arm system on the Schwarzette to beat Guel who wasn't trying to kill him in a melee oriented Dilanza of all things. Prospera has also been stated to be a better pilot than Suletta in Cradle Planet, meaning that whatever Suletta did at the end of the series, her mom can likely do better. It's just that WFM suits technology wise are only above average within the gundam multiverse, otherwise we'd have an argument for one of the most talented/powerful main casts in Gundam.\n\n#### Comment ID jssh33o with +4 score by [(KABOOMBYTCH, Reddit, 2023-07-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/154ufpz/who_do_you_consider_the_most_technically_skilled/jssh33o/) (in reply to ID jsr49zz):\nI’m sad we never see boss girl prospera dishes it out in a mobile suit :/\n\n## Comment ID jsr855e with +5 score by [(PK-Starstorm1995, Reddit, 2023-07-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/154ufpz/who_do_you_consider_the_most_technically_skilled/jsr855e/) (in reply to ID 154ufpz):\nGorrad Ran or Domon\n\nGorrad is good enough to take on newtypes despite being a normal dude.\n\nAnd given his unique gundam controls in comparison to the rest of the series, domon is easily the most skilled fighter.\n\n### Comment ID jsrhgse with +9 score by [(Time-Touch-6433, Reddit, 2023-07-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/154ufpz/who_do_you_consider_the_most_technically_skilled/jsrhgse/) (in reply to ID jsr855e):\nDomon is blatantly superhuman tho\n\n#### Comment ID jsumx6r with +1 score by [(Rendum_, Reddit, 2023-07-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/154ufpz/who_do_you_consider_the_most_technically_skilled/jsumx6r/) (in reply to ID jsrhgse):\nMan litrrally kicks a bullet in the first episode\n\n### Comment ID jsrrelr with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-07-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/154ufpz/who_do_you_consider_the_most_technically_skilled/jsrrelr/) (in reply to ID jsr855e):\nCompare Domon or Master Asia to any other pilot in G using the same piloting system and it’s obvious how abnormally and insanely skilled the two are\n\n#### Comment ID jsrxtg7 with +5 score by [(Luster-Purge, Reddit, 2023-07-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/154ufpz/who_do_you_consider_the_most_technically_skilled/jsrxtg7/) (in reply to ID jsrrelr):\nOne of the best things in Build Fighters Try is they unapologetically acknowledge how utterly OP the Jigen Haoh school of Martial Arts is, because they reveal Sekai's master?\n\nIt's Domon.

If he’s a newtype, he isn’t depicted as being that strong of one and he’s among the youngest pilots we’ve seen, but he’a dangerously effective in the Victory and V2.

If you banned coordinators you’d have to ban anyone who just so happened to have good genes for being a pilot as well. Coordinators are just people who have essentially had their genetic code modified to have specific genes in them. So on average a coordinator is stronger, smarter, faster, than a natural, but you will still have naturals every now and then that are a match for coordinators.\n\nMy vote is for either Rau la Creuset, Ali Al-Saachez, or Graham Acker.\n\n## Comment ID jsrkm1p with +2 score by [(alkonium, Reddit, 2023-07-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/154ufpz/who_do_you_consider_the_most_technically_skilled/jsrkm1p/) (in reply to ID 154ufpz):\nWhat I tend to look at is ordinary humans who are able to hold their own against Newtypes or their equivalents.

Suits and ships. Those guys are the GOATs. Char isn't even top 10 for Zeon if I recall. If he was he was only 7th or something like that. The highest kill counts for both sides were Oldtypes.\n\nAlso, in the AU series, I have to go with Master Asia in G Gundam. It is superhuman BS, but no psychic powers or suit specs, that man could literally beat up an MS or MF with his bare hands.\n\nIn AC, it has to be Zechs, because he mastered the Tallgeese without any of the pilot safety advantages the Gundam's had. If not Miliardo, I would say it was Trowa. That kid is a monster, and he fought at most times in an MS that was meant for almost purely ranged combat, but still kicked ass at close range.\n\nIn AW, Jamil Neate. After losing his Newtype abilities that man was still one helluva pilot, and officer.\n\n\nIn Turn A, I go Loran. Again, this kid has no Newtype magic or mumbo jumbo, and he repeatedly beats more experienced enemy aces, even though he doesn't want to fight.\n\nCE, it's hands down Lowe Gear/Guel. The man may have been using his computer AI buddy for assistance, but he went toe to toe with some of that world's strongest Coordinators, including a few that had the spatial awareness to use Dragoons and Gunbarrels, he is a champ.\n\nNext up, is AD, and I go Graham Aker all day. Unless we include Manga, and he and Fon Spaak tie. They are both beasts in combat.\n\nThen it's Age, and it's Asemu Asuno all day. The man earned the name Super Pilot.\n\nNext up, another future of the UC, with G Reco. I would go with Belri. The kid might not have always been the best, but he continually improved as the series went on. I still wish it would have been better received so we would have got the whole series. Maybe if they did a rehash of the series with a different character designer people wouldn't dump on it so bad.\n\nThen it's the Build series, and if all of them, I say either Reiji from Fighters or Hiroto, from Divers Re:RISE.\n\nI would add the Real Build series, but for now, I am sticking to the Anime and Manga.\n\nPD, I go with Mcillis, because that dude beat AV using Gundam MS in a less powerful suit.\n\nFinally, Ad Stella, I gotta go with my dude Bob. Might not have ever used a Gundam, but he could've beaten his brother's if he hadn't been pulling his punches. He had great character growth.\n\n## Comment ID jsqppcy with +1 score by [(AutoModerator, Reddit, 2023-07-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/154ufpz/who_do_you_consider_the_most_technically_skilled/jsqppcy/) (in reply to ID 154ufpz):\nDaily reminder that the Reddit admins are like the EFSF.

      "# Post ID 14yr2ex: Many great wrestlers from places like Russia or Iran would not make it to D1 or the Olympics if they trained in the US system. Why? with +169 score by [(Dr_jitsu, Reddit, 2023-07-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wrestling/comments/14yr2ex/many_great_wrestlers_from_places_like_russia_or/)\nHas anyone noticed the 10 million posts we get asking \"can I make it to the Olympics, I''m starting at age 14\" or \"can I make it to D1 I'm a freshman\" we get here on reddit? Almost invariably the answer is no....because that is the reality.\n\nOn the other hand, many great wrestlers from places like Russia and Iran started at that same age and win world medals. In the US you pretty much have to be dominant from day 1 in high school (or at least your sophomore year) to have a shot at D 1. Thats not going to happen if you just started wrestling at 14. For example my son's coach this summer Babak Nourzad started wresting at 14 and made the Olympics for Iran. Russia produces waaaaay more world and Olympic champs than the US and many started in what would have been their freshman year of high school. It seems that in the US you need titles by your sophomore year in the US for a D1 school to recruit you, which won't happen your second year of wrestling. In the US, except maybe for Lee Kemp, you pretty much never make it to the top starting in your freshman year.\n\nThis seems to be a huge discrepancy to me. Russia and Iran turn 14 year olds into Olympians, while America fails to do so. We train just as hard as evidenced by our conditioning. What are we doing wrong? Are they training smarter?\n\nEdit: Since my original post I put up some data to support my position: Several countries produce 3 times the world champions than the US. Given more time I can find more. Japan (of course mainly their women) should also be on that list.\n\nThe average starting age is significantly more than 10.27 years [https://grapplingschool.com/which-country-is-best-at-wrestling/](https://grapplingschool.com/which-country-is-best-at-wrestling/)  \n\n\nEdit #2: Here is the data on medal count:\n\n.[https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/188790](https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/188790)[https://grapplingschool.com/which-country-is-best-at-wrestling/](https://grapplingschool.com/which-country-is-best-at-wrestling/)\n\n## Comment ID jrtva7f with +194 score by [(Azulaatlantica, Reddit, 2023-07-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wrestling/comments/14yr2ex/many_great_wrestlers_from_places_like_russia_or/jrtva7f/) (in reply to ID 14yr2ex):\n\"Are they training smarter?\"\n\nWell the US is the ones known for conditioning while Iran and (especially) Russia is known for technique, of course they would understand training better from an educational stand point\n\n### Comment ID jrukioi with +36 score by [(Dr_jitsu, Reddit, 2023-07-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wrestling/comments/14yr2ex/many_great_wrestlers_from_places_like_russia_or/jrukioi/) (in reply to ID jrtva7f):\nAbsolutely correct. I think you are getting to the core of the answers. But they also start later. I was looking at a list and it ranked wrestlers by the number of world and Olympic medals. Now granted, IMO, an Olympic gold should count for more than a world gold, but the bottom line was that 8 out of 15 were from Russia/former Soviet Union and only 3 were from the US. I provide some more data below.\n\nThe populations are pretty similar so there is no denying that they produce more champions. I think 2 or 3 were from Iran, but that have a much smaller population.\n\n#### Comment ID jrw8xy2 with +19 score by [(YERA_B, Reddit, 2023-07-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wrestling/comments/14yr2ex/many_great_wrestlers_from_places_like_russia_or/jrw8xy2/) (in reply to ID jrukioi):\nI don't understand why you think that Russians start training later. Usually, they start training at the very early ages like 5-6-7 or even earlier. I am not from Russia, I'm from Kazakhstan, but we still have this soviet methodology of training.

Eastern block countries have a long history of training athletes from very early childhood. I mean the U.S.S.R had state training camps identifying children very early on and sending them to training centers.  Any Soviet era athletes please chime in….\n\nAlso, wrestling in the USA is centered on higher education which is definitely the end goal. Making it to Cornell, Princeton, Brown or Stanford has a much better financial outcome for our athletes and is problematic to developing olympians. Why go make $0 dollars and eat at the cafeteria in Colorado Springs when you can go work towards the American dream. Also our insistence on folk style and especially college with riding time, it’s counterproductive to Olympic wrestling.

Almost without fail US wrestlers in D1 start at around 6-7 or so and Russians start quite a bit later as laid out in the article above. I have to find the article, it is from one of the top Russian wrestling administrators but he discusses this fact in detail. He lays out very good reasons for starting older and also keeping more focus on technique which seems to have more advantages to the US focus on conditioning at such a young age.\n\nHere is another one about the topic and the number of world champions. Russia/The Soviet Union produces nearly 3 times the amount that the US produces.\n\n[https://grapplingschool.com/which-country-is-best-at-wrestling/](https://grapplingschool.com/which-country-is-best-at-wrestling/)\n\nRussia/The Soviet Union has produced nearly 700 World champions, the US only 256. You will see in the article that Japan has also produced more than the US (of course it is mostly their women) but with a much, much smaller population. Things are a bit closer in regards to the Olympics, we actually stack up pretty well, but the Soviets sill have more. And remember....many great Russian wrestlers go to Sambo instead, so we are not counting them. Kahbib would likely have been a world champ.\n\n#### Comment ID jrunqmc with +11 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-07-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wrestling/comments/14yr2ex/many_great_wrestlers_from_places_like_russia_or/jrunqmc/) (in reply to ID jruj3xa):\nMr. Douche lol\n\n#### Comment ID jrutbtb with +1 score by [(Dr_jitsu, Reddit, 2023-07-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wrestling/comments/14yr2ex/many_great_wrestlers_from_places_like_russia_or/jrutbtb/) (in reply to ID jruj3xa):\nI need to find my main article, but here is one listing the average age of wrestlers peaking, it is 26.79 years of age: [http://www.guresdosyasi.com/guresar.pdf.pdf](http://www.guresdosyasi.com/guresar.pdf.pdf)  \n\n\nIn the US you pretty must be a college wrestler (usually a top 3 D1 finalist) to even compete for the World Team.

Also, if you read the conclusion you will see that the US numbers were included (even though it was winning European titles) and that this number skewed the overall numbers lower. Without the US numbers the average starting age would have been higher than 10.27. The article does cite an article that suggests that learning throwing techniques is best started before 14. Then again Karelin started at 14.\n\n[https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/188790](https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/188790)\n\nAlso, wrestlers peak between ages 24 and 27. It takes 14.67 years to peak.

Fully 1/3 of my HS wrestling program (me included!) and like 90% of +160lb weightclasses took up the sport as a way to learn leverage, body positioning, etc, to become better football players. Despite all being reasonable strong and well-rounded athletes, we were *so* behind the technical curve. We also prioritized football camps in the summer over wrestling camps. As an adult grappler 20+ years later, I seriously lament passing on an invite to a Greco camp in NJ when I was \\~16. Even so, I'd bet if I went back and looked we all averaged .500-.750 win rates, just based on strength/speed/athleticism.\n\nYouth/HS Football in America goes beyond an extracurricular activity, sport, or hobby. It's a cultural institution. It's akin to soccer in the UK, or cricket in India. It's got an absolute grip on young athletes, who give up a disproportionate amount of their time to fight for positions on teams where only \\~30-40% of the players actually take the field (and even then, many only play half of the actual gametime due to the offense/defense split). It's also a sport that's pretty much impossible to play at the amateur level as an adult, so 99% of youth football player's careers are finished, forever, by their 19th birthday. It's the sport that more than any other has made Americans a nation of \"watchers\" rather than \"players\". \n\nI know this went a little askew from OP's original point, but I agree emphatically that a big piece of the puzzle he's trying to solve for is that the mystery American newbie 14-yr-olds that could become world champions get sucked into the Football System, and wrestling ends up getting dominated by the kids who'd been on the mat since age 6-7, well ahead of the learning curve.\n\n#### Comment ID jrw1wf7 with +2 score by [(Dr_jitsu, Reddit, 2023-07-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wrestling/comments/14yr2ex/many_great_wrestlers_from_places_like_russia_or/jrw1wf7/) (in reply to ID jruyesf):\nGreat post...this was happening to my son. He started and played both ways (football) in 8th grade then started full time as a linebacker his freshman year and then made the JV A team (there is an A and B team) his sophomore year. This was for a top football school in Texas (former 6A state champion). I saw that he was getting less and less time in football and predicted he would make varsity by his Junior year but probably would not get a lot of playing time as he did not have the raw speed to become a blue chip linebacker. Plus the behavior of the football kids was simply terrible, many where already getting thrown in jail and it was a culture of disrespect.\n\nI told him he could be mediocre in both sports, but since he was 19 and 4 wrestling JV as a freshman w/out a lot of experience (did not wrestle in Junior high) he had more potential in wrestling. It was his decision 100% and he decided to quit football. He only went 500 his sophomore year wrestling varsity (he was making mistakes) but now that he us focusing 100% on wrestling he is doing well against the top kids. He got 2 out of 5 takedowns against a senior who went 2 and 2 at Fargo at the Purler camp yesterday. This summer he beat the #3 freestyle kid in the state.\n\nBut yes, wrestling is exploding in Texas because all the football coaches realize it improves their players tremendously.\n\n## Comment ID jru4nfk with +13 score by [(An_odd_kid, Reddit, 2023-07-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wrestling/comments/14yr2ex/many_great_wrestlers_from_places_like_russia_or/jru4nfk/) (in reply to ID 14yr2ex):\nWhy do you believe that most successful wrestlers from the Caucasus region start at age 14?

That means more people can train and improve at a much more steady pace over longer periods of time.

Also, any high school wrestler who does well in big, national tournaments will get scholarships. No one cares when they started. \n\nWrestling is more popular in Russia than in the US, and it is a better career in Russia. It is my understanding that they are paid well to compete at the highest level, where as in the US that is not usually the case. There's more money outside of competition.

Eastern young wrestlers learn gymnastics and tumbling before they ever start to wrestle while I have highschoolers who can barely do a cartwheel and have close to 100 matches under their belt. Do you think the Russian program just finds 14 year olds who have never wrestled, plucks them off the street and turns them into olympians?

Wrestling is a more culturally important sport in Russia and Iran, so if you are a good athlete, you will go into wrestling. In America, if you are really athletic, you will do a sport that actually has a future, football, basketball, baseball. America's best athletes are sucked up by these sports and never see a mat. Where as in Russia and Iran, a big portion of their best athletes are funneled into wrestling.\n\n### Comment ID jryjmtn with +1 score by [(Dr_jitsu, Reddit, 2023-07-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wrestling/comments/14yr2ex/many_great_wrestlers_from_places_like_russia_or/jryjmtn/) (in reply to ID jrxpnms):\nGood point.\n\n## Comment ID jrxznpi with +2 score by [(odingalt, Reddit, 2023-07-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wrestling/comments/14yr2ex/many_great_wrestlers_from_places_like_russia_or/jrxznpi/) (in reply to ID 14yr2ex):\nLook into the Norwegian youth athletic system.  That low population country dominates the winter Olympics over and over and over again.\n\nIn the U.S. in baseball for example, to get into the U.S. baseball system you must get a private coaching for kids as young as 6 or 7 and get them in a travel team well under age 10 or they become un-recruitable.  The U.S. is also obsessed with pedigree - if you are related to an older former player that made it to nationals, college, minors, etc. you are given an automatic leg up. \n\nU.S. sports focus on early youth and waste massive amounts of effort developing players before they even mature.  Players are funneled into particular sports before they are old enough to develop their own passion and interest for a topic.\n\nThere's no actual reason why a 14 year old who has never even played a sport before couldn't train up and compete in the Olympics.  But the U.S. system doesn't work this way.\n\nAnd while the U.S. system does produce some Olympic calibre talent by putting 4 year olds into a rigorous 10-year training program, we produce Olympic calibre competitors simply by putting massive numbers of kids into these extensive programs just to produce a tiny fractional % of Olympic contenders.\n\nSo I'd argue the U.S. system is not efficient.  Doesn't mean we don't get Olympic calibre contenders, but we don't produce them efficiently as a % of our player pool.\n\nWe do work hard and have good sports science programs to bleed the most out of contenders.  We also have good doping programs as a first world scientific country.  Russia got busted big time running that lab at Sochi but we've had plenty of athletes pop positive for banned substances.\n\n### Comment ID jryu4rp with +1 score by [(Dr_jitsu, Reddit, 2023-07-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wrestling/comments/14yr2ex/many_great_wrestlers_from_places_like_russia_or/jryu4rp/) (in reply to ID jrxznpi):\nInteresting post.\n\n## Comment ID jrtucao with +9 score by [(Puhgy, Reddit, 2023-07-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wrestling/comments/14yr2ex/many_great_wrestlers_from_places_like_russia_or/jrtucao/) (in reply to ID 14yr2ex):\nI love ice cream.\n\n### Comment ID jru59gr with +5 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-07-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wrestling/comments/14yr2ex/many_great_wrestlers_from_places_like_russia_or/jru59gr/) (in reply to ID jrtucao):\nCop out.\n\n## Comment ID jru7lw9 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-07-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wrestling/comments/14yr2ex/many_great_wrestlers_from_places_like_russia_or/jru7lw9/) (in reply to ID 14yr2ex):\nBecause it’s not as advantageous as you think to start kids really young\n\n## Comment ID jrudf6c with +1 score by [(lstills, Reddit, 2023-07-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wrestling/comments/14yr2ex/many_great_wrestlers_from_places_like_russia_or/jrudf6c/) (in reply to ID 14yr2ex):\nThis is so false, you don’t need titles in your sophomore year to go d1, but it also depends on your definition of D1.

You’re talking about places where people are riding bicycles over 45 minutes for access to a barbell for strength training. I bet many of these athletes plan to wrestle but can’t or don’t until High School.\n\nConversely, sports in the USA are insanely competitive at the youth level because of parental support systems and community networks that allow kids to become so advanced in different areas that they hold a massive edge over newcomers. The area in PA that I come from is absolutely dominant at the HS level and produces more D1 wrestlers than almost any area in the nation. These guys fill out college rosters for the most part, and only the special athletes make noise nationally and never as many as you’d think. The competition catches up and passes them in college. Locally however, they beat better athletes throughout high school.\n\nSampling is almost certainly an issue as well. Taking into context the information above you can probably guess that youth participation data is way more readily available here than in other countries. For context my U14 basketball career is more well chronicled online than Giannis and Nikola Jokic even though I’m sure they played at that age and I didn’t even go on to play in High School.\n\nI’d bet there were 12 year old Americans with more wrestling results data available online than the guy who smoked Kyle Dake in the Olympics and took Silver.\n\n## Comment ID jrva6ie with +1 score by [(NicNack8, Reddit, 2023-07-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wrestling/comments/14yr2ex/many_great_wrestlers_from_places_like_russia_or/jrva6ie/) (in reply to ID 14yr2ex):\nLee Kemp started in high school and was a 3-time world champion it can happen in the American system it's just rare just like it is in Russia or Iran I think this post presupposes that foreign systems produce more late bloomers when that isn't necessarily true.\n\n## Comment ID jrvc8x3 with +1 score by [(Gr3nwr35stlr, Reddit, 2023-07-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wrestling/comments/14yr2ex/many_great_wrestlers_from_places_like_russia_or/jrvc8x3/) (in reply to ID 14yr2ex):\n100% disagree with the statement that you need to be winning titles from freshmen/sophomore year to go D1.

They were saying that Eastern European training/practice is a lot more playful and flowing and eventually leads into short bouts of the hard stuff.  That allowed them to stay on the mat longer without injury developing technical skill.  It also made them physically more resilient as their bodies had time to adapt.\n\nThis is an interesting topic because another historically American sport, Boxing, has a very similar profile.

I agree.  Boxing is a more limited skill set. Boxing also has far fewer answers if a guy isn't \"enough\" in a certain department.  \n\nI was speaking of the possibility to become \"great\" later in life as per the original post. Agreeing with your original observation, I noticed that most US Boxing \"greats\" tend to have been introduced to Boxing extremely early.  Scary early given the objective and inevitable brain consequence of the sport. As you probably know, big strong athletic ex-football players switching over to Boxing later in life are kind of a running joke in the Boxing community.  On paper they would seem to have the capability, but...  Guys coming to Boxing late in life seem to have a ceiling on development unless they have almost insane attribute combinations, e.g, Deontay Wilder.\n\nMy theory is the uniquely American approach to physical endeavors of harder=good versus what I would extrapolate based on the video I watched consistency=good.  This social concept bleeds into US youth sports. Train hard from youth and those that make it are almost unstoppable, but you lose depth and breadth of talent. Contrast that with train lighter, longer, and in a more playful way-of-life way.  It allows for larger programs that find/develop special talent over time.  This allows youth that come to the sport late to blossom versus getting ground to dust and pushed out due to the intensity level of the program.  The state sponsorship allowing for consistency in training standards and facilities helps as well, but I believe is a contributing not deciding factor.  I site Cuba as evidence of that.  Poor facilities, but high output of fundamentally sound practitioners.\n\n## Comment ID jrvnfz4 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-07-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wrestling/comments/14yr2ex/many_great_wrestlers_from_places_like_russia_or/jrvnfz4/) (in reply to ID 14yr2ex):\nRussians train by wrestling wild bears.

I've met a handful of national-level Russian wrestlers, and all of them have been wrestling basically since they could walk.\n\nAlso, there could be a bit of a different understanding about what it means to \"start\" wrestling. I can't speak to Iran, but Russia somewhat maintained the USSR's sport infrastructure, with special \"sports schools\" which promising athletes start attending around the age of 13-14. These are basically boarding schools where the kids are only training in their sport and maybe an hour or two of anything academic. \n\nCompare that to the US, where there is at least lip service done to giving student-athletes some amount of non-sport education.\n\nEven supposing that a Russian wrestler and US wrestler both \"started\" wrestling at an elite school around the age of 14, by they time they are 18, there could already be a huge difference in mat-time.\n\nJust one factor to consider. As others have mentioned, there is a different idea about managing training intensity between the US and Russia wrestling programs, with some research indicating that US wrestlers sustain more career-ending injuries.

Believe it or not, you need to have a viable and believable plan to use 2-3M for someone to invest.\n\n“That seems counterintuitive! Why would someone want to give me MORE money?”\n\nHaving more cash on hand (in competent hands where there’s a plan to put that money to use) actually derisks the investment. 50k in a company means there’s zero margin for error. If you don’t deliver or make a mistake, that 50k is gone. With 2-3M, you have longer runway to deliver, make mistakes, etc. You also have a budget for marketing and acquiring users, hiring a team, etc, all of which is important. Without that, and only investing 50k, you might have a product but you have no path to finding anyone to use/buy your product, and someone has bet on just one persons ability for deliver it all.\n\n## Comment ID l6y7q7a with +41 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l6y7q7a/) (in reply to ID 1d7bqx2):\n[removed]\n\n### Comment ID l6z6dos with +6 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l6z6dos/) (in reply to ID l6y7q7a):\ni had angels offer 10-20 each. but only after many months of work\n\n#### Comment ID l6zqy8i with +8 score by [(TriggernometryPhD, Reddit, 2024-06-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l6zqy8i/) (in reply to ID l6z6dos):\nThe juice is not worth the squeeze.\n\n## Comment ID l6z04ml with +10 score by [(DancinWithWolves, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l6z04ml/) (in reply to ID 1d7bqx2):\nDepending on your area, you should be able to find a local network of angel investors.

Success of a VC fund is based on the \"power law\" where most companies in the portfolio will fail, but a couple will be a massive successes (e.g. the Facebooks) which will not only offset the other failed companies in the portfolio, but also return outsized gains for the investors of the fund (i.e. LPs). In other words, VCs need to make bets on companies where 1) the company has enough potential to be worth in the billions, and 2) the VC firm has enough invested where they won't be too diluted when (if) that exit event happens.\n\nFor perspective, the startup I joined as the first employee raised a $7M seed round. $50k checks would come from angel investors to fill out the round and bring on advisors.\n\nLike others said, potentially work with a bank or do a family and friends round.

It’s a relatively small amount, so it will be hard to do with a full on angel, angel group, or VC.  The overhead of doing due diligence is going to eat into things.  This is going to be a job for 3Fs.  I suggest heavily that you go to friends, family, and fools."

      "# [Top 5 Data Lineage Tools (+ How to Choose)](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-lineage-tools)\nThe good news is that business leaders and stakeholders are increasingly seeing the value of data lineage in their organizations. The even better news is that the data lineage tool market offers more options for data teams every year.\n\nAs a whole, the global data catalog market is projected to grow from $878.8 million in 2023 to $4,680.9 million by 2032, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.7% during this period. That’s respectable.\n\nSo, as more data teams enter the market for lineage tools, it’s important to distinguish the apples from the oranges. Much like data lineage itself, knowledge is power when it comes to vetting potential lineage tools.\n\nThat's why we’re showcasing five potentially potent tools for data lineage here, noting the pros, cons, and pricing for each.\n\nData lineage tools: 5 worth considering\n\nGable.ai\n\nGable is a pioneering data contracts platform that's proactively bridging the gap between data producers and consumers. It focuses on proactive data quality management (i.e., shifting data quality left) by implementing data contracts early in the data lifecycle. In doing so, Gable allows teams to draft, define, and enforce data contracts, providing a collaborative environment for software developers, data engineers, and data scientists.\n\nWhile not a traditional data lineage tool, Gable's approach to data contracts offers a unique perspective on lineage. By defining and versioning data contracts, it provides visibility into data origins, transformations, and dependencies, effectively creating a proactive form of lineage tracking that starts at the source of data creation.\n\nPros:\n\nOffers a highly proactive approach to data quality\n\nUniquely able to integrate directly into development workflows\n\nCan also reduce costs and wasted effort by maintaining data integrity early in the process\n\nCons:\n\nAs a relative newcomer, Gable.ai may present a bit of a learning curve compared to other tools listed\n\nPricing: Interested parties should sign up to Gable’s product waitlist to learn more as details become available.\n\nAlation\n\nAlation is a comprehensive data intelligence platform that offers robust data lineage capabilities. It provides automatic table and column-level lineage, along with business lineage featuring metadata overlays. Alation's strength as a lineage tool lies in its advanced visualization capabilities—including end-to-end mini-map previews and data flow filtering.\n\nTogether, these features allow users to trace data from its origin through various transformations to its final use, providing crucial insights for data governance, impact analysis, and regulatory compliance. Alation's lineage capabilities are especially valuable for organizations dealing with complex data ecosystems, as they offer a clear, visual representation of data flows across multiple systems and processes.\n\nPros:\n\nA comprehensive data intelligence solution\n\nOffers advanced visualization capabilities\n\nIntegrates with many data sources\n\nCons:\n\nCan be complex to implement and use\n\nMay also be overkill for organizations with simpler needs\n\n‍\n\nPricing: Alation doesn't publicly disclose pricing. Those interested need to contact sales for a custom quote.\n\nSecoda\n\nSecoda bills itself as a data discovery and documentation platform that emphasizes user-friendliness and automation in its data lineage features. It offers automated data lineage capture and visualization, integrating with a variety of data sources and tools to provide a comprehensive view of data flows.\n\nAs a lineage tool, Secoda stands out for its ability to automatically generate and maintain up-to-date lineage information with a minimal amount of manual input. Its column-level lineage capabilities allow for granular tracking of data transformations, making it easier for organizations to understand data dependencies, troubleshoot issues, and assess the impact of changes across their data ecosystem.\n\nPros:\n\nProvides a user-friendly interface\n\nOffers strong integration capabilities\n\nLineage capture can be automated\n\nCons:\n\nAdvanced features may necessitate a learning curve for some\n\nLike Gable.ai, Scoda is a relatively new player in the market\n\nPricing: At this time Secoda doesn't publicly share pricing information. Curious parties will need to contact sales for a quote.\n\nCollibra\n\nCollibra is a solid data intelligence platform offering a suite of tools for data governance, cataloging, and lineage. Its data lineage capabilities, specifically, provide end-to-end lineage mapping with technical lineage at table, column, and transformation levels.\n\nViewed solely as a lineage tool, Collibra provides data teams with a comprehensive view of data flows across an organization. Its interactive lineage diagrams offer intuitive visual representations of complex data relationships, enabling users to easily trace data origins, understand transformations, and assess the impact of changes.\n\nThis makes Collibra particularly valuable for organizations that need to prioritize data governance, regulatory compliance, and maintain an in-depth understanding of their data landscape.\n\nPros:\n\nViewed as a comprehensive data governance solution\n\nOffers strong data lineage visualization capabilities\n\nVery robust metadata management\n\nCons:\n\nCan be expensive for smaller organizations\n\nComes with a comparatively complex implementation process\n\nPricing: Collibra offers yearly licensing subscriptions:\n\n12-month plan: $170,000\n\n24-month plan: $340,000\n\n36-month plan: $510,000\n\nDbt (data build tool)\n\nKnown primarily as a data transformation tool, dbt does data lineage capabilities. However, said capabilities are more limited compared to other tools featured above. It provides table-level lineage within dbt projects, with column-level lineage available in the dbt Cloud Enterprise tier.\n\nTherefore, when viewed as a potential lineage tool, dbt's strength lies in its native integration with data transformation processes.\n\nDbt does visualize dependencies between models, which helps data teams understand how changes in one part of a data pipeline might affect others.\n\nIts lineage features are more focused on assets managed within dbt projects—making this integration of particular value for organizations already using dbt, as it provides immediate insights into the lineage of transformed data without the need for additional tools.\n\nPros:\n\nNative integration with data transformation processes\n\nOpen-source core with active community\n\nVisualizes dependencies between models\n\nCons:\n\nLimited to dbt-managed assets\n\nFull column-level lineage only available in its Enterprise tier\n\nPricing: dbt offers three subscription tiers:\n\nCore: Free and open-source\n\nCloud Team: Starts at $50 per user per month\n\nCloud Enterprise: Custom pricing, make inquiries to dbt’s sales team\n\nWhy are data lineage tools important?\n\nAs a refresher, know that data lineage tools should increasingly be seen as table-stakes for modern organizations to establish (and reap the multitude of rewards from) robust data governance and management practices.\n\nIt’s these tools that provide the features and functionality that make fostering and maintaining pristine data quality possible.\n\nEnhanced data transparency and visibility\n\nData lineage tools provide a clear and real-time view of how data flows across an organization, enabling stakeholders to gain deeper insights into data usage, dependencies, and transformations.\n\nOft-overlooked, this transparency also contributes to a culture of impactful data-driven decision-making.\n\nImproved data quality and accuracy\n\nAutomated data lineage tools help identify data quality issues by highlighting anomalies, transformations, and potential errors in the lineage. This early detection allows data teams, stewards, and scientists to address issues promptly, ensuring data remains accurate and reliable.\n\nEfficient compliance and auditing\n\nData lineage is essential for regulatory compliance, especially in industries with strict and/or complex data regulations. These tools provide an audit trail demonstrating how data is used and processed, facilitating compliance reporting and audits.\n\nStreamlined data governance\n\nData lineage simplifies data governance by providing a clear understanding of data assets, their ownership, and the impact of made changes. As a result, lineage tools make it easier to enforce data policies and maintain optimal data quality.\n\nFaster troubleshooting and issue resolution\n\nWhen data issues arise, lineage tools enable faster troubleshooting by allowing data professionals to trace problems back to their source, identify root causes, and implement solutions as quickly as possible.\n\nEnhanced data security\n\nData lineage helps organizations identify vulnerabilities in their data pipelines and access controls, allowing for the implementation of robust security measures to safeguard sensitive information.\n\nEffective change management\n\nBy visualizing how data flows are impacted by changes, teams can assess potential risks and make informed decisions during system upgrades or process modifications.\n\nSupport for data-driven decision making\n\nData lineage empowers more people (both data professionals and their data-adjacent peers) to understand and leverage data assets, supporting true data democratization and enabling more informed decision-making throughout the organization.\n\nOperational efficiency\n\nBy automating data mapping and reducing the need for manual impact analysis, data lineage tools can save significant time and resources, enhancing overall operational efficiency.\n\nRisk management\n\nData lineage manages risks associated with data usage, transformations, and access by providing a comprehensive view of data flow and dependencies.\n\nHow to choose the right data lineage tool\n\nSituations, organizational needs, technical capabilities, and lineage tools themselves are all always in flux—so there will never be a one “best” way to go about choosing the right data lineage tool.\n\nThat said, by carefully considering the following factors and aligning them with your organization's specific requirements, you can streamline to process of learning about and comparing tools, ensuring the chosen tool provides the most value and the best fit possible:\n\nDetermine scope and depth of lineage tracking: Look for tools that provide comprehensive lineage at multiple levels—table, column, and row-level lineage. Ensure the tool captures lineage across your entire data ecosystem, not just from limited sources like BI tools.\n\nReview integration capabilities: The tool should integrate well with your existing data stack, including data warehouses, ETL/ELT tools, BI platforms, etc. Check the depth of integrations—some tools may claim to integrate with a platform but only offer surface-level connectivity.\n\nCompare visualization and analysis features: Clear, intuitive visualizations of data lineage are crucial for understanding complex data flows. Look for capabilities like impact analysis, data flow mapping, and the ability to trace data upstream and downstream.\n\nDetermine if automation and metadata collection is necessary: Automated lineage capture reduces manual effort and improves accuracy. The tool should be able to automatically collect and update metadata as your data environment changes.\n\nVet each tool’s ability to scale: Ensure the tool can handle your current data volume and complexity, as well as scale as your data ecosystem grows.\n\nConsider usability and accessibility: The tool should be user-friendly for both technical and non-technical team members. Features like search functionality and collaborative capabilities are valuable.\n\nInquire about compliance and governance support: If regulatory compliance is a concern, look for tools that offer features to support data governance and compliance efforts.\n\nAsses potential performance impact: Consider how the lineage tool might affect the performance of your data systems, especially for large-scale implementations.\n\nWeigh cost against potential ROI: Evaluate the pricing model and ensure it aligns with your budget and expected value from implementing data lineage.\n\nPrioritize future-proofing: Choose a tool that can adapt to evolving data architectures and technologies.\n\nGet a sense of each tool’s support and community: Consider the level of support provided by the vendor and the existence of an active user community for knowledge sharing.\n\nDetermine if complementary features are available: Some tools offer additional features like data quality monitoring or data cataloging that may provide added value.\n\nLooking to shift your lineage left?\n\nAgain, the right data lineage tools can dramatically enhance data governance, transparency, and quality within your organization. But it should now be crystal clear that choosing the right solution is crucial. Whether you're looking to streamline compliance, ensure data accuracy, or improve decision-making, having the right tool in your data stack is non-negotiable.\n\nGable.ai goes beyond traditional lineage solutions by introducing proactive data contracts, which tackle data quality at the source. By implementing Gable.ai's innovative approach, you’ll be setting your team up for long-term success, maintaining data integrity, and reducing costly errors early in the process.\n\nTo learn more about how Gable.ai can empower your organization with next-level data contracts and improve your overall data management strategy, sign up for our product waitlist today.\n\n‍",

      "# [Gable Steveson relishes his college wrestling comeback: \"That little bell just kept ringing\" by Ren Clayton on 2025-02-12](https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/gable-steveson-gophers-wrestling-return/)\nMINNEAPOLIS — Gable Steveson hasn't wrestled for the University of Minnesota for two-and-a-half years, but he never truly left.\n\nWhen not pulled elsewhere, the pull to the Gophers was still there for the two-time NCAA heavyweight champion and Olympic gold medalist in the 2021 Tokyo Games.\n\n\"As a lot of guys were coming in I was kind of like the first one they saw as they came in because they were always like, 'Hey, I'd like to meet Gable, and like to take a picture with the gold medal we got in the office,' so that's how it started,\" Steveson said.\n\nHe retired from college wrestling after the 2021-22 season, but he still had one season remaining of eligibility.\n\n\"It was really hard being in the spot I was in. I was trying to come back and I was trying to finish it. And that little bell just kept ringing, like, 'Hey, you got the year left, you should do it.' And then someone else would tell me, 'Hey, you got the year left, you should do it,'\" he said.\n\nThen there's the NFL dream, a path other wrestlers have attempted. Last summer for a brief stint, Steveson signed with the Buffalo Bills, his first time ever playing football.\n\n\"You go from being great at one thing to going straight to the bottom to the next thing, and you got to really adapt to who you are and who you can be in that sport,\" he said. \"I feel that being with Buffalo went really well and it was a great experience. Hopefully I get to, after this season, get back to it and kind of get a full offseason with a team and go into training camp and hopefully I can crack a 53-man [roster].\"\n\nHe's a man of many interests, but the road hasn't always been smooth. Steveson's WWE career ended prematurely. Now, he's back in amateur wrestling, hoping to lift up the Gopher program while pushing himself forward.\n\n\"There's going to be a lot of people that are going to try to take that spark away, try to take the confidence away and kind of devalue who you are. And I feel like just going through everything and getting out of a few big companies, just not losing that spark and keeping your face out there in a positive manner,\" he said. \"I feel like I did a decent job at it, just to keep people realizing who Gable Steveson is and what he can be.\"",
      "# [The Rise of Modern Data Management - Video](https://home.mlops.community/public/videos/the-rise-of-modern-data-management)\nJoin us at our first in-person conference on June 25 all about AI Quality: https://www.aiqualityconference.com/\n\nChad Sanderson [00:00:00]: My name is Chad Sanderson. My title is chief executive officer. My company is Gable AI. Well, I drink tea. Does that count instead of coffee?\n\nDemetrios [00:00:10]: Welcome back, everyone. We are in another Mlops community podcast session. I am your host, Demetrios. And today, talking with Chad Sanderson, he dropped a few bombs on me. This is probably, I think this is the third time that he's been back. And to be honest, he does not disappoint anytime. He is one of the greatest thought leaders in this space of data platforms, data quality, data engineering, you name it. He has strong stories, and I think the reason that I'm able to latch on to the stories that he tells is that he encompasses and articulates what people are feeling and talking about in the community, on LinkedIn, just in general, so well.\n\nDemetrios [00:00:58]: And he harps on why it doesn't need to be like this. First of all, he talks about the problem. He has a deep understanding of the problem from his experiences as a data engineer, and he knows that data engineers can be a bottleneck sometimes when you have these different roles, like a data scientist or a data analyst are asking a data engineer to go and figure out, go, debug why my data isn't coming in the same format that it was a day ago or why my machine learning model all of a sudden is going haywire. And I think it's a data quality issue. He's able to talk and harp on why data engineering does not need to be 90% debugging. He also goes through what it looks like, what a traditional analytics system looks like, what a traditional data platform system looks like, and how these systems currently break down and why he has set out to fix it, what he's doing at his new company. Gable was really cool to see because I knew him when he was at convoy, and he was talking a lot about the problems that they were having there and also the issues that they were trying to solve, and he mentioned that. And then he went out, and for the last year and a half, he's been talking to just about everyone in the data space, talking to companies small and large about how they are running their systems.\n\nDemetrios [00:02:23]: And he's in a lucky position because he is so well known. He gets to have access to so many different people in different size companies, different maturity levels, and different quality of their data infrastructure, and he can show what it looks like in all of these phases and where there are common problems across all company sizes, maturity levels, you name it. Let's get into this conversation with my man Chad. And as a little aside, a little secret, he's going to be speaking at the AI quality conference. We've got a few tickets left, so come join us June 25 in San Francisco. Oh, yeah. And of course, if you liked it, give us a share. Let us know what you thought of the episode.\n\nDemetrios [00:03:18]: Rate us on Spotify, subscribe on YouTube.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:03:21]: All that fun stuff.\n\nDemetrios [00:03:22]: We will talk to you on the other side. Chad Sanderson, it has been a year since we talked, I think, and when you came on last time, we were beating the drum about data quality. It's probably more pertinent than ever before. I want to know, though. It's been a year, man. What has changed?\n\nChad Sanderson [00:03:49]: Well, in the last year that we've talked, there have been some meaningful, meaningful changes. One, I got married. So congratulations. That was great. That happened in October. And then number two, I started a company, left convoy. I now have a business called Gable AI. And we are, we are, we are off to the races.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:04:16]: Building founders journey is very interesting and different than what I've done before, but pretty rewarding as well.\n\nDemetrios [00:04:25]: I believe it. So I want to get into gable a ton because you pretty much created this term data contracts, and I know you are thinking deeply about data contracts and how to help productize that idea. Before we go into that rabbit hole, though, you've been talking with people for a year, maybe over a year, on how they're implementing their data pipelines, what their data architecture looks like. Do you have insights for us on anything that you've learned when it comes to setting up proper data infrastructure?\n\nChad Sanderson [00:05:06]: Yeah, that's a good question. So I think there's a few major trends that are starting to emerge that are, that are different from the last few years, especially the sort of data bubble, I'll call it, of the early 2020s, where it was the midst of COVID The interest rates were still low, and so growing startups could afford pretty large bills for their data infrastructure. Snowflake databricks a whole host of tools, even if they didn't have that much to show for it, that's something that we're seeing is starting to change. Less companies are starting to assume that the data will inherently be valuable and that teams will just be able to find value within it. And more companies are starting to demand from the beginning that data teams have a good idea of how that data will be used and how it will generate ROI before the infrastructure exists. This is actually a callback to the way the data infrastructure used to be set up and created in the eighties and nineties, before storage and compute was decoupled. If you're a company like Ford and you wanted to invest in a data warehouse, this was an incredibly expensive task. And so you had to think very carefully, not just from a cost perspective, a literal storage and compute cost perspective, but from a human capital cost.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:06:43]: How many people are we going to be deploying to answer some data questions? How many data architects? We'll need to have some tool that's handling all the ETL, doing the transformation in some centralized place. What will we do with the data? And so this is where you see the data warehouse becoming a very popular trend. Not because it was like a generic system that sat on top of all data, but because it was very, very useful for answering a specific set of questions that drive, that were driving business value. And so what we're seeing is teams starting to think a little bit less about building up an end to end stack from day one, or primarily thinking about analytics as the main use case for data. Um, the latter. The latter is actually a pretty important point because analytics for a very long time in a company's life cycle is not going to deliver massive business value. It's more so giving you information about the product. And so it makes sense why product teams really want analytics.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:07:49]: But this is very different from something like invoice reconciliation, which has an actual cost to it. And if you don't do it well, it can impact the business negatively. Same thing with machine learning. And we're beginning to see a rise in more of those, what I would call operational use cases for data, as the primary use cases of data infrastructure, and that requires the infrastructure to be built a little bit differently.\n\nDemetrios [00:08:13]: How have you seen people do this wrong?\n\nChad Sanderson [00:08:16]: Well, I think it ties back to the analytics use case, because oftentimes the impetus for a data investment comes from product teams who want analytics for their product. Organizations can build their data infrastructure in service of analytics and not in service of operational systems. So as an example, a very common analytics data pipeline is you've got Snowflake for storage, you've got a data lake, and you can just throw all the data that you care about in there. You've got something like Fivetran to just quickly plug into these services or databases and move the data into something like Snowflake, and you've got DBT sitting on top of it to very quickly and rapidly transform it. And then you have an analytics tool like looker. This is a very common setup for early stage companies. Teams, basically thousands of teams have been using this. The problem is that setup does not actually scale, nor does it support the operational use cases.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:09:23]: One, there's a quality and governance issue there, which is if we are extracting data from the data producers using a tool like Fivetran, and the producers haven't taken any level of ownership over that data, meaning they're not treating it as a product, they're not treating it as an API, they're not, you know, thinking about, they don't have any accountability to it. Then when something changes, it means it is 100% the responsibility of the data teams to deal with that change. Now, in an analytics world, that's okay, because if the change affects your dashboard, the company doesn't lose any money. You just go in and fix whatever the issue is. But if it's a machine learning model or it's an AI system, it actually does have an impact. You can't just go back retroactively and fix things. Like, especially if you don't know about the change. Like if you've got a, let's say that your model is training every night and you have a data quality issue that maybe your test didn't catch for some reason, then your model is going to be retrained on bad data and the predictions will start having a real financial impact on the company.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:10:30]: That's one instance, but invoice reconciliation is another. Like, if we, if we don't catch that problem in a certain time window and deal with it, there are real, you know, physical consequences. And that means there has to be ownership. There has to be visibility of the data as it flows to the system. There has to be very clear expectations that are divine defined. There has to be some feedback loop from the person that's using the data to the person who's producing the data. There's a whole sort of set of features and functionality that we could talk about. But I think the best way of summarizing it is in the old world, eighties and nineties, you had centralized data management, and you can think about centralized data management in the same way you can think about the management of a library where you've got books coming in, they get stored in a catalog, you've got a librarian, and they're responsible for what comes in.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:11:26]: They know everything that goes out. They're checking what comes in and what goes out. They're organizing the books in a certain way so that they're easily findable and discoverable. And you have a staff of librarians, and this is their job, and it's what they do all day. And I think I read that the average number of books was like 20,000. Like 20,000 books in a library, which is not all that many if you're thinking in terms of datasets. Right. Some companies have hundreds of thousands or millions of datasets, and that was sort of the old way.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:11:58]: And what we're moving to is the federated way. It's like, well, we don't have these librarians anymore that are these centralized kind of people managing all the data in the company and determining who gets to have access and who doesn't. So how do you do this in more of a federated environment where the people who are actually writing the books are making those books available to the people who want the books? What does that system have to look like? And you'll find that it looks a lot more like a bookstore or like Amazon, something like that. And I think that's the change we're undergoing in data right now.\n\nDemetrios [00:12:35]: The question that came to my mind directly, as you were saying, that is just how can we make sure that if we are writing a book, other people come, and in this metaphor, they come and buy our books. And it's not like I just write a book for nobody to read. Yeah.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:12:55]: So that is one area where the metaphor slightly falls down. Because in Amazon, right, the purpose of writing the book is to sell it. But in data, the purpose of producing data may not be for other people to use it. I might produce data as an engineer because I need that data to run my application, right? Like, if I'm collecting data about, you know, a customer goes to my website, I ask them to fill out a form. It includes their name, their age, you know, whether or not they've bought any new socks in the last three days. I will use all of that information as the owner of that service to do interesting things. Like, maybe I want to send them a gift card for their birthday. Maybe I want to show their name on their profile page.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:13:41]: If I know they haven't bought any new socks in the last three days, maybe I'm going to show socks as, like, the number one item for them to buy in their list of referred items. Like, I'm actually using that data for something. And so I'm not thinking about how other people in the company might be using that data as well. Right? Like, if. If I am, if I'm saying, hey, this is useful to me, the way most organizations work is that the data teams will come in and look at all this data that's stored in the transactional system, and they will say, well, this is actually really important data for me, too. Like, we would like to know what the average age of all of our customers are. Maybe there's something meaningful we want to do with that. Or we want to know, like whether or not, you know, people have bought socks in the last three days.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:14:25]: Like, is that a relevant question for us to continue asking? What should we be showing them? In those cases, they will use tools like Fivetran, these data extraction tools, to forcibly rip the data out of the hands of the engineers that are producing them and put that data into their own environments where they can analyze it. Now you have this problem where the engineering team is making the changes to the data that they really care about. That makes sense for them, and that might mean changing stuff. They might decide, hey, I've got today in my database, I've got sort of a first name field and a last name field, but I don't think that's relevant. We're wasting space or whatever. So I'm going to create a single column that's just called name. Now, as long as it is only affecting me, that's no big deal. It's just my service.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:15:16]: I build my service in a way that can handle that change. But if these downstream teams are extracting data and they're expecting, maybe they're putting into some marketing automation or something, and they're always expecting first name, last name to be in different fields, and I've just broken that downstream marketing automation. The problem I feel, is not that these product engineers don't care, it's that they don't know, right? Like if you go to any application developer and you ask them, do you know how your data is being used and you know where dependencies on you exist and what it's being used for and how valuable it is to the company, most of these developers are going to say, no, I have no clue. And if they don't have any clue, then to your point, they are not able to even start thinking of, how do I make this data available in a safe, structured way, to make it accessible and to make it fit for purpose in the application world? It makes total sense to try to build in, you know, in this very decoupled way where I'm not stepping on anyone's toes. I can move as fast as I want within my own service. I don't have to depend on or rely on anyone else. And the whole purpose of that is speed. And the reason speed is important is because this is the age of rapid iteration and rapid experimentation.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:16:38]: We know that some features are not going to work with customers, we know some will. The faster that we can ship things and we can try things out, the more that we could hill climb our way to some sort of meaningful success with that product. But data is not like that. If I am computing a metric called profit, by definition, that metric will take a dependency on some other metric called revenue, and another metric called cost. And the revenue metric will itself take a dependency on the variety of sources of revenue within a company. When I worked at Microsoft, one source was Bing ads revenue. And then you also had all the revenue you got from selling windows, and then you got the revenue you had from the Microsoft store. These are all sources of revenue.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:17:34]: And then if you trace that line all the way back, then you can split it out into the individual line items. And so there are these chains, these trees of dependencies that form when you're trying to answer questions on data. And that cannot be decoupled, right? It's impossible to decouple that. And so when you step back and you actually look at how the data flows throughout a company, it does look more like a supply chain, where you've got a producer of kind of the raw materials, and these might be the logs that are being emitted from some service. And then that data gets transformed in some raw layer or silver layer of a data warehouse into a bit more normalized, a bit more aggregated. And then they get transformed yet again into a domain. And so here's all the events for a particular business unit. And then from there, they're transformed again into a particular metric.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:18:38]: And then it sort of on and on it goes. And if there's any break in the chain at any point, then it has a ripple effect to everyone downstream that is leveraging that data. And so, like, one of the things we've kind of been dancing around while we're having this conversation is this idea of change management, right? If I am a software engineer and I'm trying to make changes to my code, there are very well understood systems on how to do that without causing damage to everyone else that is dependent on that code. And we call this DevOps. If I'm an engineer and I'm adding a new feature that goes through a process, there's unit tests and there's integration tests, and there's pull requests. So humans look at these changes and then I get a diff. So there's things that make it easier for the humans to actually review the changes. Then there's a whole process that runs to merge the branch back into the main trunk of the codebase, then there's a whole process of ensuring that deployment is safe.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:19:47]: Then there's tools like launchdarkly that allow you to toggle that feature on and off. Then you've got tools like amplitude and Mixpanel that actually track how the business users or how the users engage with that feature. All of this is change management. I've made a change. I want to make sure that that change was safe and it had the intended effect. But if you look at the data world, none of that exists. None of that infrastructure I just talked about exists and data changes just as frequently as software changes. If I'm an engineer and I'm making a change to my database, that's data changing.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:20:26]: If I'm adding a new event that is emitted every time a user interacts with a feature, that's data changing. If I'm removing an event, that's data changing. Data is changing all the time. Yet there is no system for the teams actually leveraging that data to give any human in the loop review or feedback. There's no integration testing for data. There's no way to actually check to make sure that the data is flowing the way that it is supposed to. These are all things that you detect after the fact, right? Like, way after the changes have already happened. And generally you're looking at the outcomes, the use case, like you're looking at me.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:21:09]: You're saying your machine learning model has failed, and that's how I know that a data issue has occurred.\n\nDemetrios [00:21:16]: Yeah. All of a sudden the dashboards are starting to go wild and it's like, ooh, maybe that was because my data was a little bit dirtier than I had thought and it exchanged one too many hands or somebody did something upstream that I have no idea how or what, and then I have to go and be a detective and figure out what exactly who was changing what and where did they change it?\n\nChad Sanderson [00:21:42]: Oh, yeah. Well, I think it's on. It's on both sides of the workflow as well. There's definitely the workflow of a thing has changed. I have been impacted. How do I root cause this and what do I do moving forward? Usually that work is put onto the data engineer, because if you're a data scientist or an analyst, you don't know that.\n\nDemetrios [00:22:04]: It's very hard just saying, hey, it stopped working. What's going on? Why is this going all a wire?\n\nChad Sanderson [00:22:10]: Why did this happen? I have no idea. All I know is that it's impacting me, so I'm going to escalate it to, to my data engineering team. And then data engineering is usually the one that has to trace the lineage and say, okay, well, where is this data actually coming from? I can try to manually figure out the services that may have changed. I can look at the pull requests over time. Then I have to go and talk to the owners of those prs and say, hey, did you make a change? Did it impact this? I have to manually investigate it myself, and then I have to convince them that they need to roll that change back or put in a fix into their pr. And that takes time, right? Because they don't really care. It doesn't affect them. So it goes onto their backlog, it may take weeks, it may take months, and then once the fix is actually put into place, now I need to do a backfill, and that's the data engineering team.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:22:56]: And usually there are way fewer data engineers in a company than there are data scientists or analysts. So they become a bottleneck, right? They're getting all of these requests, they're kind of like stacking and it's very hard to address them all. That's sort of one side of the problem. And then the other side of the problem is, well, if you don't trust the data to be accurate and if there's no clear ownership of the data, that means it is your responsibility as a data scientist to make sure with, you know, 100% confidence that this data means semantically what you expect it to mean, that there's validation rules in place, that if anything changes, you are going to at least know about it. And hopefully it doesn't totally blow your model up. And that takes a lot of time and effort and work too. In fact, I think I've read like 75% of data science time is spent on validation. And that might seem like, oh, well, that's just kind of the state of the world.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:23:54]: But this is not how software engineers work. They don't spend 75% of their time trying to figure out if the API that they're ingesting is giving them the right thing or not. Like they trust that API because it is an API. It's very clearly documented exactly what this thing is that they're consuming, what it means, how to use it, and because that API exists, it means they can take a dependency on it and just refer back to the documentation and the usage and the spec on how to manage it properly. When you think about data in that way, data is an API too, right? When I'm taking a dependency on data coming from some database, it's just another interface. And yet I'm doing that without the contract. There's that word that a software engineer gets when they are leveraging an API for their services. I'm taking the dependency, but I'm not getting any of the guarantees.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:24:58]: I'm not getting any of the ownership, none of the trust, none of the documentation. And I think, like, this is one of the big things that needs to change.\n\nDemetrios [00:25:07]: All right, real fast, I want to tell you about the sponsor of today's episode, AWS, tranium and inferencia. Are you stuck in the performance cost trade off when training and deploying your generative AI applications? Well, good news is, you're not alone. Look no further than AWS's tranium and inferencia, the optimal infrastructure for generative AI. AWS, tranium, and inferencia provide high performance compute infrastructure for large scale training and inference with llms and diffusion models. And here's the kicker. You can save up to 50% on training costs and up to 40% on inference costs.\n\nDemetrios [00:25:50]: That is 50 with a five and a zero.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:25:54]: Whoo.\n\nDemetrios [00:25:55]: That's kind of a big number. Get started today by using your existing code in frameworks such as Pytorch and Tensorflow. That is Aws, tranium, and inferencia. Check it out. And now let's get back into the show.\n\nDemetrios [00:26:09]: So, how are you doing it? Are you basically inject? I'm thinking about those tests that you can get when you go to the doctor, and they check to see if your veins are clogged or not, and they put something inside your veins, and then the blood pumps all through the body, and you can see where there are places where you have, like, different clots or parts of the veins that aren't working as well because it's been tracked, right. I think it's, like, blue dye or something. And so under the special machine, you can see, like, okay, these veins are not working that well, and you have a clear picture of it. I almost feel like you need to do that, where you put a stamp on the data, and if it comes out of this API, then it is with this, like, pedigree, and you know these things. But then if anybody takes it and then they use it, and you then have that data downstream from three or four different transformations or uses, or people have touched it in many different ways, you can still retrace it because it has almost, like, all the different pedigrees as it's gone through this supply chain.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:27:26]: So the way that we think about. So what you're describing right now is sort of, I think, a more advanced form of data lineage. And if folks in the audience are not familiar with data lineage, it's essentially the process of starting from the either the looking at generally, it's sort of looking at an analytical environment and parsing through SQL and basically stepping through each query and understanding how that query was built. What table does it rely on and what table does it produce? And when you can answer sort of all of those questions for every query in your data environment, then you effectively have this big graph, and the graph shows you how one column flows to all these other different tables and views in the company. This is really great if you're using a tool like Snowflake or databricks. And the reason why is because these companies have effectively built abstraction layers on top of data. They have created the interface, which as an example would be Snowflake SQL. And everybody knows how to interact with Snowflake SQL.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:28:39]: You also have tools like DBT that write the transforms. And DBT also provides an interface that's even easier to use than Snowflake SQL. And they actually manage a lot of this lineage work for you. The problem is generally not downstream. By downstream, what I mean is what happens to the data after it arrives in some environment that a consumer of the data can do something with it. So it could be a notebook, it could be Snowflake, it could be databricks, right? It's somewhere, as long as I can access the data as like a data scientist, the problem is not really there. It's everything prior to that. Because where that data is coming from doesn't have nice clear abstractions.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:29:26]: It's the wild west, right? Like the data could be coming from, we could have a Python script that's pulling out Excel spreadsheets and dumping these CSVs into a data lake and then pushing that on some cadence into our analytical database. And anyone at any point in time can go in and make a change to the structure of that file and we would never know about it until it actually reaches us, which is too late. It could be a software engineer that is adding new logging to some feature that they've created. And then we're pushing that event via Kafka into a database. And then from the database we're going into the analytical environment. And so if I don't know that, if I don't have the link between the analytical environment and the event code, I will always have to, that will always be a manual slog for me because I will have to make that connection myself. And this is sort of the state of the world for a lot of data scientists. There is that gap between when the data actually lands in some storage system and what's going on before that.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:30:42]: And so when people talk about, like, a source of truth, that's what they're talking about, right? When someone says, hey, I want to know the source of truth of these transactions. They're not talking about the table and snowflake. They're talking about the actual moment that the event of a transaction occurs. And what does that mean? What is the underlying code that is producing that interaction, and where can they find that? So in terms of what Gable does, there's a few things. Gable is kind of a meaty platform. We tackle this problem in modular pieces. People can use any number of the modules that we produce, or they can tie them together into a more seamless experience, which is where it really gets magical and powerful. But the core of the platform is what I would call our API.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:31:37]: We can build a consistent abstraction on top of many different types of data sources automatically. So if you think about what actually makes up any data source, there's really only two components. There's the structure of the data. So that would be the schema, the data types, column names, stuff like that, and the semantics. What does that structure actually mean? What does any particular column or row mean in the real world? And then there is the contents of the data itself. So those values that I would expect from that data, if I have five categorical values in some particular field, I would never expect there to be a 6th or 7th suddenly appear. Like, maybe my system is not built in such a way to deal with that. Or if I have an age field, I would probably not expect their age to ever be less than zero or greater than 300, unless you've got putting.\n\nDemetrios [00:32:43]: Conditions and almost like guardrails onto the data so that people understand, okay, no matter what and how tainted things can get, the data is not going to come out like this. And if it does, we need to figure something out. Are you alerting people if it does show up like that? Or is it just not allowed and you get like a null or.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:33:05]: It's a bit of both. So there's sort of a flow that happens. So there's really like four main steps in gable. The first step is the identification of these data sources. And we have some magical AI driven mechanisms to scan a code base and to automatically figure out where in code is data being produced. And so that could be, we can figure out. Here's all the database tables that are being produced. All the structures that exist in your code, here's all the event code that's being produced.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:33:41]: We could connect to some file structure like s three, scan through s three, and then figure out for each file, is this file related to data? Does it have a schema and stuff like that? Or is this more of like a non data related file? Is it just like a word document or something like that? Once we have all of those, and we could do this with third party stuff too. Salesforce, SAP, whatever, it doesn't really matter. But once you have all of those identified, then we can extract structure and we can extract contents of the data and we can represent those in a standard format. So it doesn't matter if it's a postgres transactional database, if it is a segment event, a Python dictionary, a.net, executable, Java, whatever, all of that data can be extracted and organized and formatted in the exact same way. Once that's in place, we can then automatically enrich that data with lots of useful information. So because we're injecting ourselves into the git version control platform of choice. So GitLab, GitHub, whatever, you can extract the ownership on the repo level, who is the person that actually owns the code that is producing this data, that is true ownership. You can extract how that data asset has changed over time, and then you can also extract how are these assets actually connected to each other.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:35:20]: Like where do we see the same information in different assets? And that's sort of the lineage graph that I mentioned before. Once you have that and that all happens sort of automatically. Now, once you have that, now you can start to have humans come into the loop and a human can say, okay, well I have some expectations on this particular data, and those expectations might be the constraints you mentioned. So there might be some specific constraints that you have in mind that a machine would never really be able to figure out. Or maybe a machine could figure it out by doing some profiling, but we're not there yet. Or it might be something like an SLA, like hey, I always expect there to be 1000 events emitted over this time period, and if that number ever drops, it means something is probably wrong. What we can do then is based on the expectation we can alert when we detect a change is going to happen or has happened. So if you're in Ci CD, for example, we will know, is the structure of this code event going to change based on a PR hey, a software engineer has decided to get rid of a column that you, the data scientist are using.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:36:41]: We know that before that happens, same thing for new things being added. The other option is to look at the contents of the data and to say, hey, the contents of the data have changed in a way that are going, that's going to affect your machine learning model. We're going to tell you about that before the pipelines actually run and cause.\n\nDemetrios [00:36:59]: All that damage, which I imagine just seems like magic for anybody that you talk to or that you're working with, because you're like, oh my God, that is going to be a lifesaver for me. I've been spending 75% of my time trying to figure this out, and now you're just telling me it's going to work. That's incredible.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:37:15]: Well, there's a lot of things that you get for free with a system like this that I think are really cool. I mean, one thing is because we're registering the source data, then you get a nice sort of catalog of all of your data sources, which is the things that most data, data people actually want. Right? Like I said before, they don't care as much about the tables, and then from there they can, they have to go back to the sources anyway. They just want the sources. And that's something that we get. We get that for free because of this registration process. Same thing with the change management live change detection is a big part of our platform. We have a change log, so it shows over time.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:37:58]: How has a data asset changed? Who actually made the change? What was the change? It's all the context that's very relevant for the teams that are consuming all this information. And there's a bunch of other things too around data contracts and how do we agree on them and how do we collaborate as the data evolves? The thing that was most meaningful to us when we built this is how do we help the data producer. So the engineer or the salesperson or whoever is generating this data understand that they are not in an isolated environment anymore. And as long as we can integrate with GitHub or GitLab, because we're automatically scanning and profiling this code and figuring out what it's connected to and who is dependent on it, we can provide that feedback without them actually having to do anything. Meaning, if I'm a software engineer, I'm just going about my day to day work, and I'm shipping features, and I decide to change some SQL code that exists somewhere in my system. I will be told by Gable, hey, you're about to change records that other people in the company are using. Here are the people in the company who are using these records. Here is what they are using those records for.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:39:18]: You need to go and speak to them before you make this change. Or at the very least, you should write up a summary of what this change is going to be. And Gable will manage communicating that to the right people. Right. So it's not about like, applying AI magic to turn the data, resolve all data quality issues or something like that. It's applying the AI magic to bring the people together and have closer connectivity when it comes to managing and creating data in the first place.\n\nDemetrios [00:39:50]: Yeah. Just that awareness has got to be so brilliant for teams. I'm curious about you. A year, year and a half ago, left convoy with ideas on what was going to be the most valuable. It seems like you had a pretty clear vision, but it's been polished over the last year and a half. What is one or two features that people have been asking for nonstop? And you almost, like, are surprised by these features because for you, that was a non thing, but now you're talking to a lot of different companies.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:40:31]: I think something I wasn't expecting is how much of an end to end system teams really want. My initial goal when I set out was, can we build something that by pressing a button, can scan all of this code and then figure out who owns that data? What does this actually mean? And put the constraints, like the CI CD constraints in there and really start to treat data as another step in the DevOps process. That was my main goal, is bringing DevOps to data and using data contracts as the vehicle to do that. What I found, though, is that people have a much broader vision of what data contracts are. There's the CI CD approach that I mentioned, but people also want contracts for cataloging purposes. I get all of the source data in one place and I can actually sort through that source data and sort of segmented by domains. People also want the live change detection on their data sources. So I want to see how, I want to know when someone makes an update in excel in real time so that I can either protect myself or protect my data consumers on a platform team.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:41:54]: And I never want these issues to actually reach the analytical database in the first place. Right. So there was a lot more interest in that than we originally thought. And I would say I've also been surprised. Oh, sorry, go ahead.\n\nDemetrios [00:42:09]: I was just looking at how far upstream you are going. You're thinking like, very far upstream. And if you can catch this in the moment this data is created, I think that's where you want to live?\n\nChad Sanderson [00:42:26]: Yeah, our goal is to go all the way, all the way upstream. I think that they're all the way.\n\nDemetrios [00:42:33]: Maybe all the way.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:42:35]: I think that there are some places where you can't do that or there are problems that are introduced outside of that core data source. So, for example, you may have a human that is entering some data into a text field and they just enter in something that should never be entered. It doesn't make any sense and doesn't work with your pipelines or your dashboards. You can't really catch that during the CI CD workflow because there's no code being changed, but you would be able to catch that basically as soon as that data becomes accessible through some system, moving it from that front end interaction to either the database or the analytical database, you want to try to catch that as soon as humanly possible. But really, I think that the future is going to be all about code and also direct integration with any platforms or source systems that modify data, excel or Google sheets or Salesforce or SAP. A lot of data work happens in these products and there really is no oversight for data quality or data governance. If I'm a salesperson, I'm going to change around my Salesforce schema in a way that makes sense for me and my team in the way that I want it. But if that sales data is really critical to downstream teams, there's no real way of them knowing that or understanding that.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:44:08]: And so all of that, like change management, change detection, CI CD, these are all places we want to insert ourselves.\n\nDemetrios [00:44:17]: I want to just look at the other side of this, which is if you didn't have that, it's like you have to then go and manually in each one of these systems, try and create something that says, hey, alert me if this ever gets changed. And just thinking about that almost gives me a headache. On all these different data sources, on all these different people that you're interacting with, maybe for a small team at a startup, you're running fast, it doesn't matter that much. And you can deal with that technical debt once you find product market fit or you start taking off. But if you're at a gigantic company, just the amount of people that are working at that company that you would have to interface with to try and figure out like how am I going to protect my assets, which are these things that I've been working on for the past, whatever, three to six months. And I thought I was having success with them, but little did I know somebody that I have no idea in some random department changed everything. And now I don't know why, but I got to go debug it. Or I got asked by data engineer to debug it.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:45:32]: Yeah, exactly. At these big companies, there are thousands of people potentially who all touch different parts of the data that you're using, and you have no clue. A lot of these teams have thousands of microservices, tens of thousands of datasets, hundreds of thousands of CSVs. There's just enormous, enormous amounts of data, and it's very, very unclear where it all comes from and what it means and why it exists and when it changes. And so it's not just any change that happens. It's anytime you want to use that data, you have to go. There's actually this relatively narrow safe zone where you've already gone out and done all the work to understand what the data is and where it's coming from and what it means and all that. And that takes a lot of time.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:46:26]: And then there's all the changes that could potentially happen to that data because it's plugged into so many sources. So you've kind of got this relatively infrequent window where everything's okay, everything is safe, and you've just kind of perpetually got your fingers crossed that today is not going to be the day, but it always is the day. At some point. At some point, the day comes, and when it does come, it's very scary and it's a big problem.\n\nDemetrios [00:46:58]: That's why I've been championing for the data engineering appreciation day.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:47:03]: Yes, data engineers definitely need that.\n\nDemetrios [00:47:06]: So before we jump, what was the other feature that surprised you, that people were asking for a bunch?\n\nChad Sanderson [00:47:12]: Yeah. Well, I think the other thing that was surprising to me was that how excited data producers and software engineers were about this. I think that data teams really, really underestimate. There's a bit of a Stockholm syndrome going on, I think, where they've probably tried in the past to go to their engineers and say, hey, I need you to own this data, or I want you to be more thoughtful about me. And they kind of got brushed to the side, or the engineering team said, hey, this doesn't really matter. But I think that may just be the perception. When I've talked to data producers, they all seem to acknowledge the problem. They're like, yeah, we understand that this is an issue because we get asked about it all the time.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:47:56]: The issue is like, I, as a software engineer, don't have a mechanism to help them with this. Right. All of the solutions that I'm given is like, well, you need to be very thoughtful about what data lands in this table. But I don't know anything about Snowflake. I don't know anything about data bricks. I don't know anything about the data lake. I don't know about the ETL systems that you're using. I don't know anything about DBT.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:48:21]: So it's like, in order for me to help you with this problem, I have to learn like four or five different tools. I also don't have any way of, like, if something does go wrong, I don't know how to resolve that. I don't, I don't know how to root cause it. I don't even know how to figure out if it was a big deal or not. I don't know what right or wrong even looks like. So there's like this whole list of, you know, requirements that need to be met in order for a producer can take ownership. And if those, if those questions are not answered, then this just seems like a very murky, unclear, difficult problem. And they don't know how big of an investment it's going to be and so they don't do it.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:49:02]: And so when they see that the way, the way that we tackle this is, oh, this is all DevOps, this is just another step in the workflow that I already run where we're accounting for data the same way that we account for security or the same way that we account for code quality. And, oh, if I do make a change, that's not good. I'm going to be told and I'm going to be given all the context on everyone I need to talk to and why I need to talk to them and what good actually looks like and what I need to do in order to progress this pull request forward. That is very exciting. It turns this from kind of a nebulous, unclear, very confusing problem to something that is very clearly scoped, very clearly defined, and fits into the workflows that they already use. So that is what I think is probably the biggest and most interesting thing to me is just how much software engineers have gravitated towards these solutions.\n\nDemetrios [00:49:58]: Are you interfacing more with the DevOps teams or is it data engineers? Is it a little bit everybody? It feels like since the surface area is so big, you have to make sure that you are on top of it with each one of these people and that you understand their needs just as much as anybody else.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:50:19]: Yeah, I mean, I think the data engineers and data platform teams are probably still the folks that we talk to the most because they're impacted the most. They have the most. There's the most for them if there's data quality. Right, exactly. For the data consumers. So the data scientists and the analysts, they're also impacted, but they're impacted in a different way. They're usually not the ones kind of doing all the root causing and the lineage, all the stuff that takes a bunch of time. They just want to make sure that it doesn't happen, and they don't really care how it happens.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:50:55]: And then on the side of the data producers, they don't want to cause people pain. They don't want to be seen as the bad guy, and they certainly don't want to be in a situation where the whole company knows that they were the ones responsible for an outage to their machine learning model. That's what they want to avoid, but they just don't have the systems to do it. We start in the middle, and then we work our way out. What my guess is, is that over time, um, we will go the same route of. Of the devsecops kind of workflow. I think dev data ops will become a term that most DevOps teams and most engineering teams are using. And that means, like, selling, mainly selling into the software engineering organization.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:51:44]: And, like, in the same way that software engineers, they, they've now started to realize that security is a critical part of their workflow. They can't just pass that off to someone else in the organization and kind of wipe their hand cleans of it. It's their responsibility, too. If they don't do security best practices from the beginning, then hacking and fraud will inevitably happen, and all you can do is deal with it. In the same way, if you don't do data management from the beginning, data quality issues will happen, and you just have to deal with it. And that's not acceptable anymore. In the age of artificial intelligence, maybe in the age of analytics, it was acceptable, but now it's becoming a lot less acceptable.\n\nDemetrios [00:52:26]: So, funny you mentioned that, because I was just at Kubecon two weeks ago, and every other booth was a security booth. And so it is very much understood that there are no excuses for any type of security breach. So I do see this vision where you're like, we cannot use these excuses anymore for poor data quality or just for poor data practices, because so much of the business is relying upon this. You have so many different use cases that are coming from the data, and if you can quantify that even better, and it feels like when you have things set up and you know where the data sources are and you know how the data is being used. And that rich lineage, you can tell, okay, this data is giving us. It's generating a whole ton of money through these machine learning models or through these other examples that you showed. I think that is another one that just, like, gives. It shows the teams the value of the data in a way that is irrefutable.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:53:34]: Yeah, exactly. I think that we are going to start to see a big shift over the next five to ten years, not just in the tools, but in the companies that are using data. And it will split from companies that are using data for analytics primarily. And those companies will invest in low cost tooling. So very cheap storage and compute, very cheap analytic systems, probably open source. And then on the other side will be companies that are actually using data to make money. AIML is obviously one example, but there are other ways that you can monetize data or use data to save large costs. Invoice reconciliation is one example that I mentioned.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:54:20]: And those companies are going to have to treat data like a product from the very moment of its inception. And that means not just putting quality into place downstream, but upstream as well.\n\nDemetrios [00:54:34]: Beautiful, man. Well, I always appreciate coming on here. I'm super excited to get to meet you in person for the conference. We are going to be talking about this so much. We're gonna spend the whole day talking about quality. I had to have you there because when I think about quality, I. You're like one of the first people that comes to my mind. And it's.\n\nDemetrios [00:54:56]: It's almost like we couldn't have a.\n\nDemetrios [00:54:58]: Conference about quality, AI quality, data quality without having you there. So, yeah, this is gonna be fun. It's gonna be a whole lot of fun. And we're gonna get to talk about this stuff all day long.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:55:11]: Amazing. Well, I can't wait for it. And I will show up in my Sunday best and I'll cut my beard and so I don't live like a wild man out of the cave.\n\nDemetrios [00:55:21]: That's it. Actually, on a not so serious note, I was thinking, like, should we do some kind of a theme, like a hawaiian shirt or something? So if anybody has any ideas, throw them at us, because I am open to it right now. It's not too late to figure out what the theme or what the fun things that we're going to do are. We're already going to have a comedian there. We're going to have some jam sessions happening, so beware of that, too. I don't know the quality standards on those. We may need a tool like Gable to check on the upstream possibilities of the quality and give the stamp of approval for the musical session qualities. But you'll see when you come.\n\nDemetrios [00:56:12]: I guess that's. That's the fun of it.\n\nDemetrios [00:56:14]: Hold up.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:56:15]: Wait a minute.\n\nDemetrios [00:56:15]: We gotta talk real fast because I am so excited about the MlOps community conference that is happening on June 25 in San Francisco. It is our first in person conference ever.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:56:27]: On.\n\nDemetrios [00:56:27]: Honestly, I'm shaking in my boots because it's something that I've wanted to do for ages. We've been doing the online version of this. Hopefully I've gained enough of your trust for you to be able to say that I know when this guy has a conference, it's going to be quality. Funny enough, we are doing it. The whole theme is about AI quality. I teamed up with my buddy Moe at Kalena, who knows a thing or two about AI quality. And we are going to have some of the most impressive speakers that you could think of. I'm not going to list them all here because it would probably take the next two to five minutes, but just know we've got the CTO of Cruz coming to give a little keynote.\n\nDemetrios [00:57:11]: We've got the CEO of you.com coming. We've got chip, we've got Linus. We've got the whole crew that you would expect. And I am going to be doing all kinds of extracurricular activities that will be fun and maybe a little bit cringe. You may hear or see me playing the guitar. Just come. It's going to be an awesome time. Would love to have you there.\n\nDemetrios [00:57:36]: And that is again, June 25 in San Francisco.\n\nDemetrios [00:57:41]: See you all there.",

      "# [GABLE delivers all-time high income, ready to propel businesses towards the AI FIRST era with the strategy of “Sustain = Smart + Secure.”](https://www.g-able.com/insights/g-able-enable-the-future)\nG-Able Public Company Limited, a leading \"Tech Enabler\" that helps businesses embrace every aspect of the digital era, has revealed its 2024 business strategy, focusing on developing digital solutions and capabilities while enhancing businesses' readiness to address various challenges on the path to becoming AI-ready organizations. GABLE plans to expand its Business Application segment through global HCM partnerships, offering full-suite digital solutions across five portfolios to meet business needs. This expansion aligns with the core strategy of \"Sustain = Smart + Secure,\" enabling clients’ businesses to navigate the AI-First era towards sustainable success.\n\nDr. Chaiyuth Chunnahacha, CEO of G-Able Public Company Limited, stated, “As a SET-listed digital tech giant equipped with technologies and capital, our main aim is to tap into our modern and smart technologies and digital solutions to serve future business needs, secure organizational data, increase profitability, and ensure sustainable growth of our clients in the AI-First era, in alignment with the strategy of 'Sustain = Smart + Secure.'”\n\nIn 2023, GABLE achieved huge success in its initial public offering and SET-listing as G-Able Public Company Limited. This has enhanced its readiness in terms of its capital for investment in its capacity and capabilities in line with its plan to drive strong and sustainable growth. GABLE’s own software platform has served as a key growth engine propelling the Group’s solid business expansion across many segments. The five affiliated companies have been key in generating the Group’s income, using its Value-Added Distribution to further its growth. The Group’s recurring income exceeded one half of the total income, and its backlog portion climbed up to an unprecedented level of over Baht 4.5 billion.\n\nWith its extensive experience of over 35 years in helping businesses gain a competitive edge through technologies, GABLE has seen opportunities to steer its growth by capitalizing on the AI trend that plays an increasingly important role in organizations. All businesses need to develop their systems to become AI-ready organizations. In doing so, Cloud-based IT infrastructures, data analytics systems through big data platforms, and 24-hour cybersecurity systems should be established to ensure that front-office and back-office systems are ready to work synchronously with AI in the future.\n\nApart from the AI trend that is bringing more growth opportunities for GABLE, building ‘Smart Organizations’ through business applications such as human capital management software is another key growth driver because one crucial asset of an organization is “human.” According to Gartner, the HCM market is expected to see an average growth rate over the next three years at 18%. As organizations need to improve their competitiveness through building up a pool of talents, software platforms can help them do so through the use of big data and AI in talent analytics, skill management, and productivity and efficiency enhancement of employees across sections.\n\nGABLE’s 2024 strategy is originated from the adoption of the concept of “Smart + Secure” to ensure clients’ business sustainability. This consists of the following 3 main guidelines: To integrate GABLE’s Enterprise Solutions and Services core business comprising 5 portfolios, namely Data Analytics, Cloud, Cybersecurity, Application Development, and Managed Tech Services, with its IP platforms to support the preparation of AI-ready data and AI-ready security, as higher demands\n\nfor AI and cybersecurity will boost GABLE’s growth.\n\nTo expand the Group’s capabilities through potential business applications in HCM and ERP through partnering with global entities with expertise across various fields and selecting other interesting smart business applications to provide continued support for its clients. To focus on investment in businesses that are aligned with GABLE’s business concept to secure\n\nmore opportunities and satisfying rates of return; and to gain competitive edge by using its funds from its IPO worth around Baht 600 million to propel business growth under the investment framework covering three main areas: Right Product, Right Technology; Win-Win business Synergy; and Right Price, Right Value.\n\nMs. Raveeratana Satchavarodom, Chief Finance & Strategy Officer of G-Able Public Company Limited stated that in 2023, GABLE’s operating income reached Baht 5,338 million, 13% up from 2022. Despite external factors and fluctuations at macro and industrial levels leading to stronger competition, GABLE was able to navigate these challenges, achieving steadfast expansion and double-digit growth rates in income across all segments, including Enterprise Solution, Valued Added Distribution, and Software Platform, from its clients.\n\nMoreover, after its IPO, GABLE was able to generate a gross profit of Baht 1,099 million in 2023, growing 10% year-on-year, or a gross profit margin of 21%, about the same level as last year. GABLE’s net profit for 2023 stayed at Baht 253 million, and the backlog portion reached an all-time high at Baht 4,544 million, up 16% from Q3 of 2023, ready to support future income recognition. The backlog level is set to support future income generation in 2024 of over Baht 2,753 million, accounting for nearly one-half of the target income in 2024. Furthermore, the Company’s opportunities to further grow its business come from\n\nthe accelerated demand for the creation of AI-ready organizations, the need to set up data analytics and cybersecurity, its partnerships in developing business applications, and inorganic investment through M&As.\n\nBy adopting the strategy of “Sustain = Smart + Secure,” in 2024 GABLE will continue to operate its business based on the 3 guidelines, namely Smart Finance, Secure Finance, and Sustain Finance. Smart Finance is to create more financial returns from organic investment and inorganic investment. Secure Finance is to maintain financial discipline through secure operations and secure investment, focusing on sustainable investment within the so-called Investment Framework to ensure secure and sustainable business growth in the long term. And Sustain Finance is to establish sustainable financial growth, including mitigating risks to be within acceptable levels.\n\nThe above strategy will lead to GABLE’s growing backlog and its move towards reaching another all-time high this year at around Baht 4.5-5.5 billion. GABLE will expectedly continue to maintain its gross profit margin at 20-22% with its recurring income of more than 50% of the total income, to support risk management for investors. With its sound financial discipline and available capital of more than Baht 600 million from the IPO along with its capacity and capabilities, GABLE is ready to grow further in line with the upcoming trend in 2024.",
      "# [x15ventures names Gable as Xccelerate winner](https://www.commbank.com.au/articles/newsroom/2025/02/xccelerate.html)\nThe Commonwealth Bank’s venture-scaling arm, x15ventures, has named data change management platform, Gable, as the winner of its latest Xccelerate program. The startup has secured a SAFE Note investment and is actively exploring multiple partnership opportunities with CommBank.\n\nFounded in Seattle in 2023 by Daniel Dicker, James Frost, Adrian Kreuziger and Chad Sanderson, Gable helps developers ensure quality and governance of important data as it flows through an organisation.\n\n“Before Gable, the founders worked at a late-stage startup where we were constantly wrestling with problems caused by the quality, governance and change management of source data,” Gable CEO Chad Sanderson, explained. “That’s why we founded Gable, to help businesses understand where their data is, who owns it and where it's going.”\n\nGable’s platform uses AI to identify where data is produced from within an organisation and monitor how it flows across services and databases. This helps flag sensitive data like personally identifiable information (PII) and trigger alerts within an environment when compliance or quality standards are at risk.\n\n“In a world in which organisations rely on more apps and services than ever before, having clarity around the quality and lineage of your data is critical. This is particularly true for those operating in regulated industries, where reporting obligations continue to evolve and businesses are looking to take full advantage of AI,” x15 Chief Technology Officer Kelvin Lim said.\n\n“We were impressed with how Gable’s approach could help shift important work – for example, tracking changes to critical data, identifying PII or sensitive data, and setting compliance policies – into the hands of our engineers. This gives them the confidence that any code changes made won’t inadvertently break things, helping to prevent complex data problems downstream and freeing up testing, governance and compliance teams to focus on what they do best\" Mr Lim added.\n\n\"With numerous ventures in our portfolio, and lots of different ways they generate data, it's important we know exactly where that data flows. Gable’s tech could enable us to do that in a unique and efficient way – and we’re really excited to explore what's possible.”\n\nGable was one of nearly 100 startups to apply for the latest Xccelerate program, which focused on solutions ‘ reimagining the customer and employee experience with data and AI’. It was the first time the program was open to international as well as homegrown founders.\n\nAs a result of winning Xccelerate, Gable will now commence a project with x15 to detect code changes across its isolated technology environment, while exploring a number of more expansive opportunities across CommBank.\n\n“We believe organisations stand to gain a lot from creating a shared data culture of collaboration, accountability, quality and governance. It was clear from early in the program that x15 not only shares that view but had already taken steps to shift more risk management into the hands of its engineers,” Mr Sanderson said.\n\n“Even to be exploring potential partnerships with CommBank – a recognised leader in financial services innovation and AI maturity – feels like a vote of confidence in our mission. We think we’re building something special here, and I look forward to spending more time in Australia over the coming months to explore what Gable, x15 and CommBank could achieve together.”\n\nAs a result of the 2024 program, three other finalists – Cleric, Dragonfly Thinking and Eidiex – are also actively exploring partnership opportunities with CommBank.\n\nAbout x15ventures\n\nx15ventures is a venture scaler powered by CommBank. Founded in 2020, x15 builds, buys and invests in startups that would benefit from connections to Australia’s leading bank, and could improve the lives of its more than 15 million customers, by either reimagining existing CommBank products or services, or offering solutions not traditionally classed as finance, but that could extend the bank’s relationship and relevance with customers.\n\nx15’s platform model combines the latest cloud technology (running on a separate tech stack to CommBank) with enterprise grade controls, enabling ventures to innovate at pace in a 'bank safe' environment, and scale through access to CommBank assets – including capital, brand, and customer distribution – once ready.\n\nFor more, please visit: x15ventures.com.au\n\nAbout Xccelerate\n\nXccelerate helps early-stage founders understand pathways to partnership with the Bank, connecting them with mentors and experts within x15 and CommBank to help accelerate the growth of their businesses.\n\nTo be eligible for Xccelerate, applicants were required to be pre-Series A and aligned with the program theme and CommBank’s AI Principles, which apply to all AI systems designed, developed, deployed, or used by the bank.\n\nPast Xccelerate alumni include financial workflow management company, Paytron (2022), which has since been acquired by ASX-listed OFX, and agtech integrator, Pairtree Intelligence (2023). Automotive retail platform provider Vyro has also leveraged connections it forged through Xccelerate23 to secure a partnership with CommBank and digital auto marketplace, carsales.",
