      "# [What is DataOps? Everything Most of Us Need to Know](https://www.gable.ai/blog/dataops)\nSomething interesting is taking place in the world of DataOps right now. A big something. But whatâs really interesting is whatâs at play behind the scenes.Â\n\nAccording to our friends at Global Market Insights (GMI), the calculated annual growth rate (CAGR) of the DataOps platform marketplace is projected to grow 22% from 2023 to 2032 (i.e., less than one decade). By comparison, this is potentially 1% more than the much-buzzed-about low-code application marketplace is projected to grow during the same time.Â\n\nHowever, the factors driving DataOps arenât quite as clear compared to low-code.\n\nData orchestration capabilities need to keep pace with the growing volume and complexity of Big Data, and this is part of the reason for this exceptional amount of growth. Improving customer service and experience, increasing operational efficiency, and maintaining competitive advantages are ongoing priorities for businesses.\n\nHowever, this near-exponential investment in DataOps may be due to a reckoning between two other causal trendsâthe increasing business need for real-time data insights and the growing impact of data governance and compliance globally.\n\nTo better understand why, letâs start by breaking down DataOps, covering its core principles, best practices, and implementation challenges within modern organizations.\n\nA basic definition of DataOps\n\nFor those who work in leadership or data-adjacent teams, DataOps is a lot like shifted paradigmsâno doubt youâve heard it mentioned while doing business. However, lacking any direct experience, what exactly DataOps is may be less than clear. Letâs correct this now.\n\nDataOps is short for Data Operations. It is a process-oriented methodology that shares and builds on many characteristics of Agile methodologies, DevOps, and lean manufacturing. Simply, the goal of DataOps is to reduce the cycle time of data analytics. In practice, it does so by streamlining collection from data sources to consumption by data consumers.\n\nBroadly speaking, the DataOps process is driven through an organized emphasis on automation, collaboration, and communication. For good reason, this means DataOps and DevOps cross streams quite often in practice. Both are instrumental in keeping Big Data and business value from being at odds.\n\nWeâve done our best to compare and contrast both processes elsewhere. But know that exploring the core pillars of DataOps helps clarify the distinct role it plays.\n\nCore principles of modern DataOps\n\nAndy Palmer coined the term \"DataOps\" in 2015, describing it as the intersection of data engineering, data quality, and data integration with a focus on various data professionals in a given organization communicating and collaborating to increase the velocity, reliability, and quality of data analytics.\n\nWhile the concept and practice of DataOps has evolved and expanded beyond Palmerâs definition the core principles that enable professionals to put DataOps into practice remain largely the same:\n\n1. Automation and Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)\n\nThe beating heart of DataOps is automation, which aims to reduce manual efforts related to data validation, integration, and deployment processes.\n\nThis often includes automating data ingestion, testing, monitoring, and deployment within a build/deployment pipeline to ensure both consistency and reliability.\n\n2. Agile and lean methodologies\n\nPractitioners work to streamline data management processes by incorporating agile and lean methodologies.\n\nAgileâs focus on flexibility, continuous improvement, and the delivery of high-quality products in short cycles enables data teams to accelerate experimentation and adaptation based on feedback. Lean methodologies, in turn, guide teams to streamline data pipelines, minimize inefficiencies, and ensure that data delivery remains firmly coupled to business needs.\n\n3. Collaboration and alignment\n\nEffective DataOps encourages a culture of collaboration and alignment among cross-functional teams, which typically includes data engineers, scientists, and business stakeholders.\n\nFostering collaboration in this fashion ensures data products align with business needs and that data analysts can deliver all insights efficiently.\n\n4. Cloud-first and scalable infrastructure\n\nModern DataOps ecosystems should prioritize cloud-based solutions for optimal scalability and flexibility.\n\nThis principle specifically supports distributed data processing and storage, enabling organizations to scale data operations as needed.\n\n5. Highly automated and continuous processes\n\nDataOps ecosystems should feature high levels of automation to manage the scale and scope of enterprise data efficiently and effectively.\n\nIn practice, this often includes automating the cataloging, movement, and organization of data, in addition to testing and releasing processes.\n\n6. Openness and interoperability\n\nAn ecosystem in which DevOps practitioners leverage best-in-class, open-source, and potentially free tools is essential for innovation. The inverse also holds trueâDataOps practitioners should avoid reliance on single, proprietary platforms (as opposed to a variety of tools that are easy to integrate and replace).\n\nThis ease of integration should also apply to a broad spectrum of potential data sources (e.g., data lakes, data warehouses) to improve data quality and governance.\n\n7. Data quality and governance\n\nImplementing robust data governance guidelines and practices is essential to ensure high data quality.\n\nAt a minimum, governance should involve data validation, cleaning, and reconciliation processes which can ensure accuracy and reliability throughout the data lifecycle.\n\n8. Ephemeral environments and code reuse\n\nEphemeral environments are temporary by nature, so using them for testing further enhances flexibility and accelerates development. As such, they reduce the risk of conflicts between environments while promoting resource efficiency.\n\nCode reuse helps practitioners maintain consistency, reduce errors, and save time by avoiding duplications of effort. Additionally, containerization encapsulates applications and their dependencies into containers that can run reliably in different computing environments.\n\n9. Monitoring, observability, and customer centricity\n\nDataOps practitioners should prioritize continuous monitoring and observability of data pipelines, ensuring data availability, performance, and security. This is vital for identifying, addressing, and resolving issues as quickly as possible.\n\nWhile DataOps practitioners focus on reducing cycle times for data delivery, enabling faster insights, and improving data-driven decision-making, ultimately everything done must remain rooted in delivering value to the organizationâs end-users and customers.\n\nBeing such an elemental aspect of any data practice, itâs also beneficial to explore how other data leaders articulate their core principles of DataOps. For an excellent perspective to which we can compare and contrast the above, we recommend looking at DataKitchenâs seminal DataOps Cookbook (that is, after finishing our own article, here, of course).\n\nDataOps best practices\n\nIf core principles are one side of the DataOps coin, best practices are the other. Without them, no amount of core principles would allow organizations to actively streamline their data management processes, accelerate their insight generation, and (perhaps most fundamentally) improve data quality.\n\nBecause of this, DataOps best practices naturally intertwine with the principles outlined above. But the key best practices are still worth detailing, as they are applicable across industries and organizations:\n\nFoster a collaborative culture\n\nThe existence of departmental silos within organizations is understandable. But they arenât acceptable. This is why DataOps best practices begin by breaking down obstacles and fostering communication and collaboration between teamsâdata engineers, data scientists, business users, stakeholders, and operations.\n\nDataOps makes data quality and accessibility a shared responsibility across an organization, which, in turn, sets the stage for all best practices that follow.\n\nAdopt a customer-centric approach\n\nToo often, adopting a customer-centric approach emerges as an afterthought in the practice of DataOps. This borders on being a tragic irony, as the benefits of DataOps itselfâenhanced value delivery, promoting agility and responsiveness, driving innovation, fueling trust and loyalty, etc.âcan only be fully realized by engaging with end-users to understand their needs, challenges, and desires.\n\nImplement agile methodologies\n\nLook to agile practices like sprints and scrums to manage data projects, allowing for rapid iteration and responses to change. Practitioners can also use Agile approaches to prioritize work based on business needs and value.\n\nHowever, it bears noting that when practitioners seek to leverage Agile as a DataOps best practice, they must ensure its impact is balanced and holistic within the organization. When employed dogmatically, these Agile methodologies can muddle the practice of proper documentation, over-complicate data management, erode data quality for the sake of responsiveness, and potentially introduce security and compliance risks.\n\nFor these reasons, make sure that Agile within your organization is used as part of the overall DataOps solution, not a solution unto itself.\n\nAutomate data pipelines\n\nActively implement CI/CD pipelines in order to automate data integration, testing, deployment, and monitoring processes. In addition to this best practice of reducing manual efforts and errors, CI/CD pipelines help ensure seamless, automated updates and deployments.\n\nEmbrace continuous testing\n\nLeverage automation to test data quality, data integration, and performance throughout the organizationâs data lifecycle.\n\nFurthermore, test-driven development (TDD) approaches should be adopted for data-related code and pipelines. TDD encourages earlier issue identification and potential integration issues while contributing to overall data quality.\n\nMake version control ubiquitous\n\nTrack changes and facilitate collaboration by utilizing version control for all data assetsâcode, configurations, and data modeling, to name a few.\n\nAdditionally, data versioning strategies should be considered to manage changes in datasets. Doing so enables reproducibility and replicability, supports the experimentation and iteration that DataOps champions, and allows organizations to demonstrate the lineage and provenance of their data.\n\nObsessively monitor data quality and performance\n\nThe ability to identify and solution for issues quickly requires the continuous monitoring of pipeline performance and data quality.\n\nEstablishing key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics related to quality is itself key for operationalizing effective monitoring capabilities.\n\nEnsure data security and compliance\n\nData security, privacy, and compliance checks should be embedded through data pipelines to protect sensitive information while helping the organization comply with all relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).\n\nThese compliance checks also require regular reviews, and security practices must be updated to keep pace with ever-evolving threats and regulations.\n\nInvest in scalable and flexible infrastructure\n\nUtilize cloud services and technologies that bolster operational pillars of effective DataOps, scalability, optimal data processing, and organizational flexibility.\n\nIn doing so, data teams should consider adopting data virtualization and containerization capabilities to improve agility and resource efficiency.\n\nLeverage metadata management while planning for growth\n\nWork to implement robust metadata management practices to improve data discoverability, understanding, and governance.\n\nAs part of planning for future (perhaps inevitable) growth, design data architectures and systems to allow for easy adaption and scaling. Use metadata to automate data lineage, data cataloging, and impact analysis.\n\nEmbrace ongoing learning\n\nAs part of laying the foundations for future growth, DataOps initiatives should encourage team members to continually seek out, evaluate, and adopt emerging technologies and practices that will benefit the organization over time.\n\nDataOps is a journey, not a destination. As such, opportunities and areas of improvement should always be identified as part of a culture of testing, learning, and growing.\n\nCommon roadblocks to DataOps implementation (and how data contracts help)\n\nWhether an organization is just getting off the ground or has already experienced some measure of success, DataOps practices may be poorly defined or functionality non-existent. This is also common and commonly attributed to one or a combination of many of the challenges that follow. Fortunately, drafting and implementing a robust data contract can help in all cases.\n\nChange-averse cultures\n\nItâs not uncommon for progressive thinkers to face resistance from within when trying to inspire a shift towards more collaborative, agile approaches to data management. Reluctance to adopt new processes (even those that are clearly beneficial) in addition to existing departmental silos can hinder DataOps initiatives before they can even begin.\n\nIn these situations, the data contract drafting process can act as a cultural balm, as it necessitates a clear definition of expectations, responsibilities, and roles of all parties involved in data management and usage (not just those directly involved in data analytics). The drafting process also mitigates resistance to new workflows by setting and/or codifying standardized processes all stakeholders must agree upon.\n\nSkill or knowledge deficits\n\nEven a modest implementation of DataOps requires a healthy mix of skills that span data engineering, data science, software development, and operations. Depending on their size or maturity, an organization may lack the diverse skill set and experience needed to integrate these distinct disciplines effectively.\n\nNo data contract is capable of directly addressing gaps in skills and experience. The implementation of data contracts does, however, clarify standards and requirements for data security, access, and quality. As such, they can indirectly guide employee training and development.\n\nInadequate data governance\n\nAs mentioned, effective DataOps relies on the foundation of solid data governance. Therefore, organizations may struggle to implement governance frameworks that are both robust and agile enough to support modern DataOps practices.\n\nData contracts directly support governance within an organization by establishing clear guidelines for data usage, sharing, and management. The framework for compliance and data quality standards established as theyâre drafted makes governance more actionable and aligned with ensuing DataOps goals.\n\nComplexities regarding data integration\n\nThe ability to integrate data from a variety of sources presents significant technical challenges, especially in complex or legacy IT environments. This complexity can stall the progress of DataOps implementation by making data pipelines hard to manage or brittle.\n\nConversely, data contracts simplify integration efforts by specifying data interfaces, standards, and formats. This ensures that raw data from any number of sources will be compatible with the organizationâs data infrastructure and can be processed and analyzed with optimal efficiency.\n\nPervasive data quality issues\n\nPoor data quality is (unfortunately) a common challenge in the business world, undermining analytics and eroding trust in data-driven decision-making. This can be an open secret too, with employees painfully aware of the issues substandard data is causing while struggling to quantify what exactly is to blame.\n\nThe metrics, validation processes, and remediation steps for non-compliance that data contracts define can make this a non-issue within organizations. This proactive approach (which is always ideal, especially in enterprise data environments) quickly becomes instrumental in maintaining high data quality across the organization.\n\nDifficulties in scaling data operations\n\nFinally, as organizations grow, itâs increasingly challenging to scale data operations efficiently while maintaining data quality. DataOps aims to address scalability issues but, ironically, a lack of foresight and flexibility regarding processes and infrastructure can prevent this from happening.\n\nData contracts circumvent these issues through the guidelines and expectations for data infrastructure, processing capabilities, and performance metrics they crystalize. This ensures that as the volume of data an organization must subsist on grows, systems and processes adapt and scale accordingly.\n\nDrafting an optimal DataOps process\n\nItâs clear that DataOps functions best at the genetic level of data-driven organizations. Itâs also clear that, given such high stakes in the market, business leaders should be doing everything in their power to get their own DataOps right.Â\n\nAs covered in the last section, data contracts serve as an excellent solution to ensure this happens. That said, the benefits these contracts bring to a data-centric organization extend far beyond DataOps.Â\n\nFor a quick, digestible, informative primer on data contracts, give Why Data Leaders Opt for Ounces Over Pounds a read.\n\nThis article is part of our blog at Gable.ai â where our goal is to create a shared data culture of collaboration, accountability, quality, and governance.Â\n\nCurrently, our industry-first approach to drafting and implementing data contracts is in private Beta.Â",
      "# [About Gable](https://www.gable.ai/about-gable)\nIn 2019, the Gable co-founders: Chad (CEO), Adrian (CTO), and Daniel (Founding Engineer) worked together on the Data Platform team at a late-stage freight tech startup called Convoy. Data was incredibly valuable at Convoy. It drove everything from a central pricing model to dashboards that powered day-to-day business operations. Despite this, data scientists, analysts, and data engineers were constantly dealing with data quality, data governance, and change management issues stemming from issues with upstream source data.\n\nAfter spending time talking to dozens of data teams, the trio realized that the data industryâs approach to managing data at the source was 15 years behind software engineering.Â Data contracts, integration testing, unit testing, diffs, and monitoring were all sorely lacking outside the Data Warehouse. This caused data quality issues to cascade from upstream sources into the analytical environment spurring an overflow of failed tests and randomly changing data - a problem that madeÂ data productsÂ fundamentally unscalable. Shortly after, Gable was born, with the mission of creating a data culture of collaboration, accountability, quality, and governance.",
      "# [4 Best Data Producer Practices to Improve Your Data Quality](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-producers)\nData engineering teams and data producers can find it hard to collaborate within an organization for a number of reasons.Â\n\nPoor data quality is one of them.Â\n\nFor example, a customerâs address may be recorded incorrectly, which can affect their delivery. Sometimes, there are inconsistent data formats (e.g., inconsistency between two datasets). These issues can make data integration tricky and hamper data analytics. As a consequence, you risk dealing with outages and lose a lot of time that goes into fixing things.Â\n\nThatâs precisely why you need to gain a thorough understanding of data producers, assess their relationship with data consumers, and follow best practices for data producers to minimize data quality issues and improve your data management.Â\n\nWho and what are data producers?Â\n\nA data producer is anything that collects, processes, generates, and stores data thatâs relevant to your organization and makes it available for data consumers. This can be a user interface, service, device, systemâor human.Â\n\nData producers serve a key role in data lifecycle as the main source of truth. This information is fed into analysis and decision-making processes. Since data producers often generate unstructured data or raw data, it needs to undergo further processing in order to derive meaningful insights from it.Â\n\nFor example, a point-of-sale (PoS) system is a data producer for a retail company. It generates raw data in the form of sales transaction records, including customer information, product ID, and purchase details. You can perform processing and analysis on this data via customer segmentation or sales trend analysis to understand consumer buying behavior.Â\n\nSoftware engineers, on the other hand, are also data producers because they develop and maintain systems and applications that generate large amounts of data. They create transactional databases, message queues like Kafka topics, and other tools that produce data.\n\nData producers vs. data consumers\n\nWhile data producers generate data, a data consumer is an entity that uses it. Data consumers copy this data, perform data transformations on it, or send it to other systems. Some examples of data consumers include marketing automation platforms, BI platforms, data analysts, and data scientists. In the case of data analysts, Python, SQL, and other tools can analyze, transform, or visualize data.Â\n\nTechnical overview of data producers\n\nConsider an ecommerce website that uses a database to store product information, customer profiles, and transaction records. The website's API serves as the intermediary, enabling seamless communication between the database and the front-end interface. The website provides users with a user-friendly interface to browse products, add items to their cart, and complete purchases.\n\nWhen it comes to data producers, your data follows a unidirectional path. In other words, data only flows upstream or downstream at any given time. In this example, the data follows a unidirectional flow, starting from the database, where product information and customer details are stored. The API then processes this data and delivers it to the front-end interface, allowing users to view product listings, add items to their cart, and make purchases. User interactions with the front-end interface, such as selecting products and completing payments, are returned to the API and then stored in the database.Â\n\nWhat you should keep in mind is that a data producer can function as a data consumer in a different context. The database functions as the data producer when it generates and stores data for the website. The API is the data consumer when it retrieves the data from the database.Â\n\nHowever, the API becomes the data producer when the front-end interface (acting as a data consumer) calls it to retrieve data. Similarly, the front-end interface can become a data producer for the customer who is now the data consumer that goes through the information provided on the website.Â\n\nData producer examples\n\nData producers can consist of any of the following:Â Â\n\nSoftware engineers act as data producers when they develop applications or systems that generate data during user interactions.\n\nSales associates contribute as data producers when they record customer interactions and sales transactions into company systems. The data they generate helps to improve customer relationship management and boost sales.\n\nCustomers become data producers by interacting with the companyâs platforms via online purchases and social media engagement. Their activities generate valuable data on user preferences, behaviors, and feedback. This data helps to analyze and improve customer experience in the future.Â\n\nBest practices for data producers\n\nStruggling to maintain standardized data formats and failing to streamline data integration can leave your organization behind the curve and impact your decision-making processes. Data engineering managers should consider the following best practices for data producers to improve data management within their organization.Â\n\n1. Understand your data sources\n\nYou need to understand your data sources when it comes to data producers. When you assess how the data was created and its context, you can identify potential inaccuracies, biases, or limitations.Â\n\nFor instance, an automated employee attendance tracking system is a data producer. The system serves as the data producer by generating and recording employee attendance data. Understanding the data sourceâin this case, a biometric attendance systemâallows the office management to identify any potential inaccuracies or limitations. They might recognize that the system may not be able to capture nuanced attendance details, such as the reasons for late arrivals. By reviewing these limitations, office management can implement relevant initiatives such as periodic manual checks to provide more accurate information for data producers.\n\n2. Introduce metadata managementÂ\n\nMetadata management provides context and information about the data. It helps data producers understand the structure, meaning, and relationships within a dataset. For instance, data producers, such as customer service agents, need to know how the customer data is organized with the CRM system.Â\n\nMetadata management includes documenting and categorizing different data types within the CRM system via a data catalog. This can help agents understand whether the data is numerical, textual, or categorical. They can also learn about relationships between different data entities. For example, it can uncover how customer data is linked to past purchases or interactions.Â\n\n3. Implement data quality assuranceÂ\n\nData quality assurance is an ongoing process to ensure data is accurate, reliable, consistent, and relevant. It includes using a wide range of techniques and practices to maintain and improve the quality of data that producers generate. This process involves validating data at the point of entry, identifying and resolving errors within it, and ensuring it remains consistent across different systems throughout the organization.Â\n\nConsider a financial firm where a transaction monitoring system serves as a data producer. The system generates data on customer transactions, account activities, and financial operations. Implementing data quality assurance in this context includes validating how accurate the transaction data is, ensuring data is standardized and consistent across different accounts, and detecting any potential fraudulent activities. This can be done through real-time transaction monitoring, anomaly detection algorithms, and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance checks.\n\n4. Use a data collaboration management platform\n\nGartner analysts predict that by next year, 50% of businesses will embrace a modern data quality solution.Â\n\nAfter GitHub was launched in 2008, it quickly became a must-have tool for software development teams throughout the world for companies of all scales. GitHub helped teams to manage and track code effectively in a collaborative environment.Â\n\nSimilar to how GitHub was highly needed for software teams, thereâs a need for a collaboration management tool for data teams. Fortunately, Gable.ai fills this vacuum. Gable.ai can bridge the gap between data producers and data consumers. By introducing data contracts and a data collaboration system, the platform can help to improve data quality, consistency, and communication.\n\nFor example, if you have an order processing system as a data producer and an inventory management system as a data consumer, Gable.ai can create data contracts for them. These contracts define specific data parameters that are required by the inventory system and ensure that the order processing system produces data according to its needs.Â\n\nRevolutionize the way you communicate data between your data producers and consumers",
      "# [Data Debt: What To Know and What You Should Do About It](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-debt)\nAccruing data debt might be the cost of doing business in today's digital economy. But, just like its financial cousin, data debt can cost a business dearly if left unmanaged.Â Â\n\nAnd, while the monetary analogy makes for a helpful onramp, it's crucial to appreciate the unique and specific impacts data debt has on organizations. While gaining this appreciation, it's also essential to differentiate data debt from technical debtâan analog that occurs in data engineering and software departments.\n\nData debt, to begin with, refers to shortcuts and compromises made within an organization related to data quality, data architecture, and data management in an effort to accelerate access to data. As opposed to creating immediate issues, data debt accumulates over time and can create significant, long-term challenges that, ironically, \"seem to come out of nowhere.\" And, while a majority of modern business models are susceptible to these effects, data debt is particularly troublesome within organizations for whom accessible, reliable, high-quality data is mission-critical.Â\n\nAlternatively, for technical debt, the causal decisions often involve hardware and software-related factors. While the \"costs\" associated with correcting technical debt can impact an entire organization, the damage inherent in data debt can be far more insidious.Â\n\nData is increasinglyâif not overwhelminglyâfueling the engines of modern business. Poor data quality, compounded by an accumulation of data debt, compromises data-driven decision-making.Â Â\n\nWhat's more, left unchecked, data issues can also lead to operational inefficiencies, hamper scalability, harm customer trust, increase security and compliance risks, and more.Â\n\nFor these reasons, proactively handling data debt should be considered mission-critical. And the ability to do so hinges on helping stakeholders appreciate the multitude of ways data debt can damage an organization.\n\n13 symptoms that may mean data debt is sinking the ship\n\nIntegration issues: When a company moves to adopt new tools or systems, data debt begins to complicate the integration process, leading to delays, complexity, and errors. This same situation can occur when two companies merge and are forced to reconcile two drastically different data systems.Â\n\nProject delays: Projects in highly data-dependent departments (e.g., IT and product development) may be the first to slow down, be put on hold, or begin going over budget as teams increasingly deal with inconsistencies or proper data hygiene.\n\nSystem degradation: Data debt can begin to compound data integrity, creating malfunctions, service errors and outages, or even complete system failures.\n\nPoor decision-making: Itâs admirable when an organizationâs leadership tries to use data to make better decisions. But data debt can begin empowering sub-optimal strategies and actions that cause more harm than good. In this sense, no data truly is better than bad data.Â\n\nMissed opportunities: As data grows untrustworthy or begins to lag behind real time, leadership will also struggle to capitalize on market trends, competitive intel, or the evolving needs of their own customers.\n\nReduced productivity: Employees who end up (re)cleaning, transforming, and validating data are spending less time on their own tasks. As data debt snowballs, inefficiencies and lessening throughput do as well.\n\nIncreasing operational costs: The constant rework needed to counteract an organizationâs growing debt begins increasing direct costs like bringing in more resources to help, and indirect costs related to lost time and effort.\n\nSecurity vulnerabilities: Data debt can begin to erode overall security, leading to lax user access management, inadequate encryption, or outdated data storage protocols that begin exposing the organization to unacceptable amounts of risk.\n\nRegulatory and legal issues: Common debt contributors make it exceptionally difficult to handle user data with the same level of integrity and transparency once limited to a few specific industries, like finance and health care. But, while the scope of who needs to clear regulatory bars has changed, the consequences of failing to do so havenât, often resulting in severe penalties and/or fines.\n\nDecreasing employee morale: Weâve touched on impacts ranging from projects and processes to workflows and costs. Unfortunately, data debt can also announce itself through the toll it takes on employee wellbeing. Frustration builds as day-to-day employees continually deal with data-related fire drills, leading to low morale and updated LinkedIn accounts.\n\nDissatisfied customers: Ongoing data issues eventually leech out through the walls of the organization as billing mishaps, ineffective customer support, misleading product recommendations, and poor customer experience begin frustrating customers.\n\nBrand reputation damage: The same data quality issues that begin to eat away at customer satisfaction can also harm an organizationâs reputation within its industry. This, in turn, puts the screws to customer acquisition and retention.\n\nDulling competitive edge: Companies that manage data effectively generate insights faster, utilize them better, respond to market changes quicker, and not only innovate but do so more rapidly. For organizations drowning in data debt, the exact opposite holds true. And itâs these organizations that, sooner or later, find themselves losing step with competitors.\n\nBest practices for managing data debt\n\nFortunately, despite all the factors that can contribute to data debt within an organization, there is an array of best practices that business leaders can champion to counteract debtâs ability to accrue. Broadly, these best practices can be lumped into three categories: procedural, technological, and cultural. Or, as itâs commonly known in reference to digital transformation, âpeople, processes, and technologies.â\n\nProcedural best practices\n\nThese best practices begin and end with instituting and supporting a robust data governance framework. To counteract data debt, this framework needs to clearly outline all methodologies, use cases, procedures, and policies related to the data lifecycle.Â\n\nThe governance framework should be employee-accessible, ensuring individuals at all levels of the organization understand data standards and how they can avoid contributing to poor-quality data. These efforts should also include training and workshops, so the entire organization gets on (and stays on) the same page regarding data management best practices.\n\nAs you develop your governance framework, put a system in place for documenting how data is collected, processed, and stored. Plan to use this system as a foundation for clear data lineage procedures in order to benefit from the ability to trace and map dataâs unique journey throughout your organization.\n\nProcedures also need to account for data retention policies, outlining where data should be retained, for how long, and whether it should eventually be archived or deleted entirely. Audit processes should then be put in place so that data is regularly reviewed for consistency, accuracy, and relevance.\n\nTechnological best practices\n\nNext, turn your attention to tools and technology that actively work against data debt. Ideally, this begins by modernizing your data infrastructure. Data should be migrated carefully from any legacy systems to more agile, efficient, and scalable systems. And cloud-based solutions continue to make this increasingly easy to implement.Â\n\nConsider introducing data integration platforms to keep the merging, cleaning, and integration of data from different sources streamlined over time. Metadata management systems make it easier to manage, store, and access valuable context about data as it flows into, and through, your organization. Use data quality tools and automated data validation so that new data is validated against a specific set of standards, and corrected automatically when those standards arenât met.\n\nAnd while access to data documentation and context should be widely available, access to the data itself shouldnât be. By implementing access control tools you can dial in user permissions, ensuring only specified individuals can access and modify data.\n\nCultural best practices\n\nWith proper processes and technologies in place, you must absolutely address the human element inherent in an organizationâs data debt.\n\nStart with buy-in from leadership because data quality is everyoneâs responsibility. Without executives and stakeholders making this clear, data quality within an organization will rot from the roots upâdiligent, day-to-day processes ultimately keep organizational data aligned with the truth. Itâs important, then, to ensure top management commits and is ready to take accountability for their organizationâs data debt. Leadership will also need to ensure best practices are funded and adopted.Â\n\nWith leadership behind these efforts, a culture of data ownership can actually be fostered. As employees begin to benefit from data debt mitigation, it will be easier for peers to hold each other accountable for good data management and contributing to data quality.\n\nAs this sense of ownership takes hold, encourage a collaborative environment where departments work together on data projects, as this requires unified standards, promotes data literacy, and breaks down silos.\n\nKeep communication channels open so that your increasingly empowered employees can easily suggest improvements and report data issues as they arise. Comparing and contrasting feedback from different departments can uncover valuable insights. And, finally, actively reward data hygiene.\n\nA natural by-product of these best practices is that the idea of data quality and data debt will become much more tangible. Reinforce this tangibility by recognizing and rewarding teams and individuals who maintain the highest standards of data quality and management.\n\nData contracts: 10 ways better data agreements and specifications are paving a data debt-free future\n\nData contracts can play a pivotal role in minimizing or mitigating data debt. At its core, a data contract is a formal agreement or specification that outlines the format, structure, and semantics of data. They are particularly important when different systems or services interact with one another, ensuring a standardized and expected format of data exchange. Here's how they can help:\n\nStandardization: Data contracts ensure a consistent structure, which means that data from different sources or teams adheres to a unified format. This reduces discrepancies and inconsistencies, a common form of data debt.\n\nValidation: Data contracts can be used as a validation mechanism, ensuring that incoming or outgoing data meets specific criteria or standards before processing. This can prevent inaccurate or corrupt data from entering the system.\n\nDocumentation: A well-defined data contract serves as a form of documentation thatâs version controlled, clarifying how data should be structured, what each attribute means, and any constraints on the data. This reduces the chances of misunderstandings or misinterpretations.\n\nInteroperability: As organizations grow, they may integrate multiple systems, tools, or external services. Data contracts ensure seamless integration by setting clear expectations about how data should be sent and received between systems.\n\nReduction in ambiguity: With clear data contracts, there's less guesswork or ambiguity involved in how data should be managed or understood, reducing the risk of errors.\n\nEasier troubleshooting: When issues arise, having a data contract in place makes it easier to pinpoint deviations from the expected data format, speeding up troubleshooting and resolution processes. Contracts also ensure that the correct data owners are contacted based on the specific issues at hand.Â\n\nSupport for evolution: As data needs change, data contracts can be versioned, allowing for organized transitions and updates. This ensures that even as changes occur, there's a clear record of different data formats and structures over time.\n\nEfficiency in collaboration: When different teams or departments collaborate, having clear data contracts reduces friction and misunderstandings. Everyone knows what to expect, ensuring smoother collaboration.\n\nTransparency and trust: For consumers of the data (which might be internal teams or external partners), a clear contract gives confidence in the data's consistency and quality, fostering trust.\n\nEnhanced compliance: For industries with stringent regulatory requirements around data, having clear data contracts can assist in ensuring compliance by setting and following clear data standards.\n\nTo harness these benefits, it's essential to ensure that data contracts are kept up-to-date, widely accessible to relevant stakeholders, and strictly enforced.\n\nAnd thatâs the core principle Gable was designed to address. Join our beta waiting list to be one of the first in your field to learn how data contracts are foundational aspects of a strong data strategy, effectively curbing the accrual of data debt.\n\nâ",
      "# [Data Modeling 101: General Foundations to Specific Frustrations](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-modeling)\nServing as a (very real, fully accredited, we swear) 101-level collegiate course, this blog article aims to lay a solid, real-world-based foundation regarding the concept and practice of data modeling.Â\n\nAs such, the article will include a summary of data modelingâs historical prevalence in data engineering, its more recent dissolution, a definition of the concept, and different methods of use.Â\n\nWeâll conclude by exploring why any attempt to discuss the benefits of one type over another consistently equates to booting a hornetâs nest.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nThis foundation will serve as a gateway for newer data engineers, function as a juicy target of ridicule for the more seasoned, and will act to foster an appreciation for the role data contracts will play in data modelingâs future.\n\nCourse schedule:\n\nData modeling: An overview\n\nData modeling defined\n\nCommon types of data models\n\nCauses of controversy in the data modeling space\n\nRestoring the model of balance\n\nSuggested next steps\n\n1. Data modeling: An overview\n\nAt one point in the not-too-distant past, data modeling was the cornerstone of any data management strategy. Due to the technical and business practices that were predominant at the end of the 21st century, data modeling at its zenith placed a strong emphasis on structured, well-defined models.\n\nHowever, in the late 2000s, the emergence of major cloud service providers like Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) enabled cloud computing to gain traction within business organizations.Â\n\nBy the end of that same decade, the benefits of scaleable, on-demand computing resources led to a proper surge within business organizations, which then led to the proliferation of what is now commonly referred to as the modern data stackâa group of cloud-based tools and technologies used for the collection, storage, processing, and analysis of data.Â\n\nCompared to the at-the-push-of-a-button benefits available on demand, data modeling was then seen by a growing number of practitioners as rigid and inflexible. Data modeling takes time. It can get complicated. The costs and overheads associated with the process reflected this. Perhaps most damaging at the time, it became easy to frame data modeling as a bottleneckâdead weight hampering the speed and flexibility of modern data management.Â\n\nHowever, this overemphasis on speed and flexibility and the underutilization of data modeling wasnât sustainable. Though there is no specific âbreaking pointâ to point to, by the mid-2010s, these issues became increasingly attributable to data modelingâs diminution.Â\n\nWhile far from exhaustive, increasingly common factors helped to precipitate this recalibration in the data space:\n\nData governance challenges: The abundance of cloud-based data storage and processing fueled an explosive increase in the data sources and repositories the average organization had access to. This sudden abundance, in turn, intensified the maintenance of data quality, security, and compliance, irreparably complicating the governance process.\n\nData quality issues: The fevered rate at which cloud-based solutions were adopted resulted in the neglect of data modeling and proper data architecture, resulting in inconsistencies, data quality issues, and difficulties in data integration.Â\n\nLack of standardization: While cloud environments freed teams to use various tools and platforms, the consistency of data management practices degraded, making it harder to ensure consistency and interoperability across an organization.\n\nScalability and performance issues: Without proper data modeling, it became difficult to optimize systems for performance and scalability. Bottlenecks and reduced system efficiency resulted as data volumes grew.\n\nSecurity and compliance risks: Rapid cloud adoption without adequate attention to data modeling and architecture can expose organizations to security vulnerabilities and compliance risks, especially when dealing with sensitive or regulated data.\n\nDifficulties in extracting value from data: Without a well-thought-out data model, organizations struggle to extract meaningful insights from data. Inevitably, these organizations found that simply having data in the cloud did not guarantee it was inherently usable or valuable for decision-making.\n\n2. Data modeling defined\n\nData modeling is the practice or process of creating a conceptual representation of data objects and the relation between them. Data modeling is comparable to architecture, in that the process blueprints how data is stored, managed, and used within and between systems and databases.\n\nIn essence, there are three key components of data modeling:\n\nEntities: Entities represent the real-world objects or concepts an organization wants to understand better. Examples of data modeling entities include products, employees, and customers.\n\nAttributes: These are the characteristics or properties of the entities being modeled. Attributes provide details that are used to describe and distinguish instances of an entityâproduct names, prices, customer names, phone numbers, etc.\n\nRelationships: The connections between entities in a data model are called relationships. They can be one-to-one, many-to-many, or one-to-many. Each entity is represented in a relational database in the typical data modeling process. While each entity has a unique identity, it can have multiple instances.Â\n\nTraditionally, the role of data modeling primarily focused on designing databases for transactional systems and normalizing data to reduce redundancy, improving database performance. The process itself mainly involved working with structured data in relational databases.\n\nModern data modeling is highly varied by comparison. And while its practice and process have evolved beyond some of its inherent qualities viewed negatively in the past, others are now increasingly accepted as trade-offs to be balanced against.\n\nData modeling today caters to a wide range of data storage and processing systems, ranging from traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS) to data lakes and NoSQL databases. Data models now facilitate data integration. They can support advanced analytics, data science initiatives, and predictive modeling. Modern models emphasize agility and scalability to quickly adapt to shifting business requirements.\n\nAs such, data modeling now also supports efforts in the data space to democratize data, helping to make data more understandable and accessible to a wide range of users.\n\n3. Common types of data models\n\nThere are four main types of data models, conceptual, logical, physical, and dimensional. This is true when the goal is to simplify the categorization of data models.\n\nDepending on the business needs of an organization, however, more than these initial four may be considered and utilized. We note the former simply because of the confusion this can sometimes cause within the data space.\n\nConceptual data models\n\nThe purpose of conceptual data models is to establish a macro, business-focused view of an organizationâs data structure. Conceptual models are often leveraged in the planning phase of database design or a database management system.\n\nIn these cases, a data architect or modeler may work with business stakeholders and analysts to identify relevant entities, attributes, and relationships using unified modeling language (UML) and entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs).\n\nLogical data modeling\n\nLogical data models work to provide a detailed view of organizational data that is independent of specific technologies and physical considerations. By doing so, logical models are free to focus on capturing business requirements and rules without being biased by technical constraints. As a result, they can provide a clearer understanding of data from a business perspective.\n\nThe ability of less technical stakeholders to more easily understand logical data models also makes them a particularly useful tool for communicating with technical teams.\n\nPhysical data modeling\n\nAlternately, physical data modeling aims to capture and represent the detailed structure and design of a database, taking into account the specific features and constraints of a chosen database management system (DBMS), as well as business requirements for performance, access methods, and storage.\n\nFor this reason, the entities database administrators and developers will focus on include physical aspects of a databaseâindexes, keys, partitioning, stored procedures and triggers, etc.\n\nDimensional data modeling\n\nFor business intelligence and data warehousing applications, dimensional data modeling is often used. This is because a dimensional model employs an efficient, user-friendly, flexible structure that organizes data into fact tables and dimensions to support fast querying and reporting.\n\nDue to this, dimensional data models can specifically support related applications' complex queries, analysis, and reporting needs.\n\nObject-oriented data modeling\n\nBased on the principles of object-oriented programming, object-oriented data modeling represents data as objects instead of entities. The objects in this type of data modeling encapsulate both data and behavior. This object-oriented approach is key, making object-oriented models highly useful in scenarios where data structures must reflect real-world objects and their relationships.\n\nCommon examples of these scenarios include ecommerce and inventory management systems, banking and financial systems, customer relationship management (CMS) systems, and educational software.\n\nData vault modeling\n\nAs the word âvaultâ implies, data vault modeling is used in data warehousing, but also in business intelligence. Both data warehousing and BI projects benefit from the historical data preservation, scalability, flexibility, and integration capabilities that data vault models provide.\n\nIn theory, this makes data modeling a potential tool for any organization that needs to integrate data from multiple sources while maintaining data history and lineage (e.g., healthcare organizations, government agencies, and manufacturing companies).\n\nNormalized data modeling\n\nThis type of data modeling focuses on two thingsâreducing data redundancy and improving data integrity. This can be crucial for transactional systems where data integrity and consistency are of prime importance. Normalized models are easier to maintain and update, while they also prevent data anomalies like inconsistencies and duplication.\n\nDe-normalized data modeling\n\nAlternately, de-normalized data models involve the intentional introduction of redundancies into a dataset in order to improve performance. Through de-normalized modeling, related data can be stored in the same table or document. This reduces the need for computationally expensive join operations, which can slow down query performance.\n\nBecause of how they function, de-normalized data models also harmonize with the principles of NoSQL databases, which prioritize flexibility, scalability, and performance.\n\n4. Causes of controversy in the data modeling space\n\nData scholars agree that discussions around data modeling function similarly to a hornetâs nest in natureâboth tend to cause massive amounts of pain when stumbled into. While unfortunate for the stumbler, it helps to understand that, in both cases, damage results in the attempt to defend what one holds dear.\n\nFor hornets, driven to protect the nestâs existing and developing queens, the aggression results from a combination of their innate programming, alarm pheromones, and the instinct to attack in numbers in order to intimidate and dissuade larger foes.\n\nFor data practitioners, however, aggressively defending oneâs beliefs about the process and practice of data modeling is usually motivated by one or more of the following factors:\n\nDiverse perspectives: Data modeling is a field that intersects with numerous disciplines, including data science, software engineering, database design, data analytics, and business intelligence. While sharing varying degrees of overlap, these disparate professional backgrounds act as frames through which the views of âeffective data modelingâ become wildly divergent in the data space.\n\nComplexity and trade-offs: Additionally, data modeling tends to involve near-endless tradeoffs between competing priorities. These tradeoffs include speed vs. governance, normalization vs. performance, and structure vs. flexibilityâeach with passionate advocates on both sides of the aisle.\n\nOrganizational context: The ârightâ data model in one organization may not be the same in another, even when operating within the same industry. Differing business rules and goals, data requirements, schema, information systems, and data maturity all but guarantee that there will never be one true data modeling technique or process.\n\nSubjectivity in design: Data modeling itself can be quite subjective. Like many design disciplines, there are often multiple ways to model a given dataset. And data modelers themselves often have legitimate reasons for championing one approach over another. This subjectivity is part of why many find the challenges of data modeling so fulfilling.\n\nEvolving technologies: Despite the order and logic practitioners attempt to bring to the table, the exponentially rapid evolution of data technologiesâfrom traditional relational databases to NoSQL, low and no-code platforms, and big dataânecessitates approaches to data modeling to continuously diversify.\n\nFluctuating best practices: Due to the ever-evolving modeling landscape, its related best practices invariably need to change. Techniques once considered sacrosanct can find themselves outdated, furthering debates about what the current best approach may be at any given time.\n\nEmotional Investment: Data practitioners tend to be curious, persistent, analytical thinkers who benefit from a high attention to detail. As such, those who practice data modeling (or cross paths with it) tend to invest a great deal of intellectual and emotional capital in their work. Occasionally, this can create an environment where critiques or suggestions for alternate approaches can either be delivered as a personal attack, or taken as such.Â\n\n5. Restoring the model of balance\n\nThe good news is that navigating the tension between the impact of data modeling and the convenience of the modern data stack is inevitable. Organizations helping to strike the balance should consider employing the following:\n\nAdopt a hybrid approach: Consider using structured data modeling for core business entities that require consistency and stability above all. In areas that call for more agility and flexibility, employ modern data technologies that enable rapid iteration.\n\nHarmonize flexibility with standardization: Building on a hybrid approach, look to standardize core data elements and processes. At the same time, allow for flexibility in areas where rapid change can be expected. Embrace constant balancing and rebalancing of the strengths of structured data modeling and the modern data stack.Â\n\nUse iterative data modeling: Instead of insisting on extensive upfront data modeling, try an iterative approach. Start with a basic model, then evolve it as needed. Iteration can produce the best of both worlds, maintaining a structured approach while responding to requirements as they change over time.\n\nLeverage data virtualization: Data visualization provides a helpful layer of abstraction that allows for integrating diverse data sources without extensive modeling. In some organizations, this approach maintains agility while ensuring data is effectively understood and used.Â\n\nFocus on metadata management: Bridging the gap between structure modeling and agility usually involves a (sometimes renewed) focus on effective metadata management. Robust metadata curation further enables organizational flexibility while clarity regarding data structures and relationships is maintained.Â\n\nEmphasize data governance: When individuals are empowered to enact consistent data governance, clear policies and standards guiding data quality, usage, and security help ensure a data environment remains as agile as possible.\n\nEnable self-service data access: When implemented with appropriate controls, self-service data access supports agility by allowing users to access data as needed while still operating within the framework of the established data model.\n\nContinuous collaboration: Make sure to foster continuous collaboration between your data architects, engineers, and business users. While the passionate data modeling discussions will still take place from time to time, making cross-disciplinary collaboration an important part of the culture helps keep modeling efforts and business needs aligned.Â\n\nImplement data contracts: Finally, employ data contracts to provide structured agreements on data formats and interfaces. Their ability to foster communication between data producers and consumers promotes balance just as the other tactics here doâbut also allows that balance to scale.\n\n6. Suggested next steps\n\nAs is now abundantly clear, treating data as a product is paramount for any organization looking to succeed in an overwhelmingly data-dependent world. Data contracts are the best way to guarantee the quality of data before it even enters an organization.Â",
      "# [Driven Organizations Are What They Eat](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-testing)\nData testing isnât new. However, it is taking on newfound urgency as major trends involving artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, cloud computing, edge computing, and DataOps drive a surge in organizational data consumption.\n\nThis mirrors how trends in global food production led to the rise and prominence of food testing and safety protocols. As our food supply becomes increasingly globalized, tracking, quality assurance, and transparency are paramount. Similarly, in the digital realm, as data is sourced and integrated from diverse global sources, ensuring its quality, reliability, and transparency through rigorous testing becomes crucial.Â\n\nDoing so ensures that data-driven decisions are based on solid, trustworthy information, just as strict food safety protocols guarantee the food we consume is safe and of high quality.\n\nWhat is data testing?\n\nData testing is the formalized process of validating the accuracy and quality of data within a system. This makes it an increasingly important process as more organizations and industries look to data-driven decision decision-making and real-time analytics to remain competitive.\n\nThe process of testing data involves a combination of techniques and methodologies. Together, they aim to help data teams identify and solve data quality issues that affect its value for data consumers and stakeholdersâinaccuracies, inconsistencies, and incomplete data sets.\n\nWhile the specifics vary across organizations and industries, data testing commonly encompasses four main areas:\n\nValidation of data integration processes ensures that data from different sources is accurately merged and transformed.\n\nPerformance testing of databases and data processing applications ensures they meet the required speed, efficiency, and scalability.\n\nSecurity testing safeguards data integrity and privacy, which is especially critical in the context of regulations like GDPR and CCPA.\n\nCompliance testing verifies that data handling practices adhere to relevant legal and industry standards.\n\nDoes all data need to be tested?\n\nData quality is imperative for data-driven organizations. Therefore, data testing in some form or another is now essential. Without it, data teams and consumers within the organization would roll the dice regarding the integrity, accuracy, and reliability of the data pouring into and through the business.\n\nMore specifically, there are 10 key reasons why data testing is essential:\n\nEnsuring data quality: Data testing verifies that the data obtained is correct, complete, and consistent, which is vital for maintaining high data quality standards. High-quality data is essential for accurate analytics and decision-making.\n\nIdentifying coding errors: By testing data, organizations can identify coding errors early in the development process, which saves time and reduces costs associated with fixing issues later on.\n\nSupporting regulatory compliance: Data testing ensures that data management practices comply with relevant standards and regulations, such as GDPR and HIPAA, protecting sensitive information and avoiding legal penalties.\n\nImproving user satisfaction: Accurate and reliable data testing leads to the development of applications that are dependable and of high quality, resulting in increased user satisfaction and trust in the company.\n\nReducing costs: Identifying bugs early through data testing is significantly cheaper than fixing issues discovered after a product release. This represents potential savings for companies and contributes to a better user experience.\n\nFacilitating better decision-making: Reliable data testing ensures that the data used for analytics and informing business strategy is accurate, which is crucial for making informed business decisions.\n\nEnhancing efficiency: By identifying and addressing issues with systems that store and analyze data, data testing improves the efficiency of these systems and processes, leading to better productivity and cost savings.\n\nProtecting data privacy: Data testing plays a crucial role in ensuring data privacy and security by identifying potential vulnerabilities and ensuring that sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access or breaches.\n\nReducing data-related defects: Accurate test data reduces the number of data-related defects or false positives, thereby increasing the efficiency of the testing process.\n\nSupporting Agile and DevOps practices: Proper test data management and testing are essential for supporting modern software development practices like Agile and DevOps, which require regular integration and continuous testing.\n\nHow to determine what you should test\n\nDetermining which data you should test involves a series of steps and considerations to ensure that the test data is representative, relevant, and comprehensive enough to validate the software application effectively. Here are the key steps and best practices for determining the test data:\n\n1. Define clear test data requirements\n\nBefore creating or acquiring test data, it's essential to define the test data requirements that match the scope, objectives, and scenarios of your testing activities. This includes specifying the type, volume, format, and quality of the data needed to test the software effectively.\n\n2. Understand the application's data dependencies\n\nAnalyze the applicationâs data dependencies, data types, and data sources to select the most appropriate test data. This involves understanding the features, functions, requirements, risks, and assumptions of the software under test.\n\n3. Use activity diagrams to understand code performance\n\nFor Agile practices, activity diagrams are crucial to understanding what specific function a new modification or new piece of code is going to perform. Then, define data to support that use case or set of scenarios.\n\n4. Design a strong data discovery processÂ\n\nA robust data discovery process involves identifying and understanding the data requirements for each test scenario. Proper data discovery helps in selecting the most appropriate test data and ensures that the test environments closely resemble real-world scenarios.\n\n5. Refresh test data regularly\n\nRegularly refreshing test data is essential to maintaining data accuracy and relevance. Outdated or stale data can lead to invalid test results and hinder the identification of critical defects.\n\n6. Employ automation where possible\n\nAutomating Test Data Management tasks can significantly improve efficiency and reduce the risk of errors. Automation tools generate test data, refresh test environments, and anonymize data quickly, enabling testing teams to focus on the actual testing process.\n\n7. Create a review and auditing processÂ\n\nEstablishing a review and auditing process ensures that the test data is accurate, reliable, and complies with data privacy regulations. Regular reviews by designated stakeholders, along with internal audits, help identify any anomalies or data quality issues.\n\n8. Maintain data securityÂ\n\nEnsuring that sensitive and confidential data is protected requires implementing data masking, encryption, and access controls. This ensures that only authorized personnel can access and use sensitive data during testing.\n\n9. Manage test data via business entities\n\nInstead of working to understand the complexities of source systems, databases, tables, and columns, testing teams should be able to simply define the business entities for which they need test data.\n\n10. Extract on the fly\n\nEnable the tester, or test data automation tool, to request the data needed to perform a given test, in flight, without any preparation.\n\nData testing methods: When to use each\n\nData testing is a crucial aspect of ensuring data quality and integrity in various applications and systems. Different data testing methods are designed to address specific aspects of data quality and system functionality.Â\n\nHere's an overview of various data testing methods and the appropriate contexts for their use:\n\nData completeness testing\n\nData completeness testing verifies that all expected data is present and that there are no missing values or records. This method is essential when data migrates from one system to another or when integrating data from multiple sources to ensure that no data is lost in the process.\n\nData accuracy testing\n\nData accuracy testing involves verifying that the data in the system is correct and accurately represents the real-world entities or transactions it is supposed to model. This method is crucial for applications where data precision directly impacts decision-making, financial calculations, or any other critical business processes.\n\nData consistency testing\n\nData consistency testing checks for uniformity in data across different databases, systems, or data stores. It is particularly important in distributed systems or environments where data is replicated across multiple locations to ensure that all copies of the data remain consistent over time.\n\nData integrity testing\n\nData integrity testing ensures that the data remains accurate and consistent as it undergoes operations such as transfer, retrieval, and storage. This method is vital for systems that involve complex transactions or operations that modify the data, ensuring that data relationships and constraints are maintained.\n\nData validation testing\n\nData validation testing verifies that the data meets specific criteria or constraints, such as data types, ranges, and formats. This method is used in scenarios where data is inputted into the system through forms or APIs to ensure that only valid data is accepted and stored.\n\nData transformation testing\n\nData transformation testing involves verifying that data transformation operations, such as aggregations, conversions, and calculations, are performed correctly. This method is crucial in data warehousing and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes where data is transformed before being loaded into the target system.\n\nData migration testing\n\nData migration testing is conducted to ensure that data is accurately migrated from one system to another without loss, corruption, or alteration. This method is essential during system upgrades, platform changes, or when consolidating data from multiple sources into a single repository.\n\nPerformance testing for Big Data\n\nPerformance testing for Big Data involves assessing the system's performance, including data loading speed, data processing speed, and the performance of individual components. This method is critical for applications that process large volumes of data and require high performance to meet user expectations.\n\nRegression testing\n\nRegression testing ensures that new changes, updates, or additions to the system do not adversely affect the existing functionality, including data processing and handling capabilities. This method is used after software updates, bug fixes, or new feature implementations to ensure that the system continues to operate correctly.\n\nEach of these data testing methods addresses specific aspects of data quality and system functionality. The choice of method depends on the particular requirements of the system being tested, the nature of the data, and the specific objectives of the testing process.\n\nConsider testing the idea of data as a product\n\nData testing is a critical component of treating data as a product because it ensures the data product's quality, reliability, and usability. When data is treated as a product, it is developed, managed, and delivered with a high level of care and attention, akin to any other product offering.\n\nThus, our analogy with food isnât merely playful. We are increasingly recognizing the problems created by prioritizing the availability of food over its quality, and, by extension, its lasting impact on our health.\n\nAs increasingly complex organisms in a digital ecosystem, this helps explain why the movement to treat data as a product is gaining momentum. Competitive advantages are increasingly reliant on the implementation of new tools, data contracts, and other digital transformation initiatives that drive holistic and sustainable data-driven decision-making.\n\nThat said, are you hungry to learn more?

      "# [What Are Data Contracts? What Leaders Need to Know](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-contracts)\nFounding Father Benjamin Franklin knew a few things about a few things. However, what he couldnât know is how much one of those things relates to the use of data in our modern ageâthat itâs far easier to prevent a fire than it is to put one out.Â\n\nThis insight, the basis of the proverb âAn ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,â came from Franklinâs work to counsel city leaders in 18th-century Philadelphia, helping them deal with particularly hazardous urban fires.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause Franklin knew what the stakes were. Heâd witnessed firsthand how panic and disorganization prevented any response to a blaze from being efficient, coordinated, and effective. And he realized that, when everything around you is on fire, success at best can only be less of a failure.Â\n\nSo it goes with data, especially with the sheer impact it has on modern business, society, and well, life in general. But here, in our more modern world, Franklinâs favoring ounces over pounds relates squarely to data contracts and the role they play in preventing our need for high-quality data from erupting into flames.Â\n\nThat said, as vital a role as theyâre already playing, data contracts are a newer concept to many, even unheard of by some. So let this article serve as our proverbial Bucket Brigade, raising awareness of the value of data contracts by defining exactly what they are, how they work, and valuable ways they can be used.\n\nWhat is a data contract?\n\nA data contract is a formal agreement between two or more parties that outlines specific terms and conditions of data sharing. These contracts can exist between organizations, systems, or individuals.\n\nWhere traditional contracts exist as written or spoken agreements, data contracts tend to encompass a combination of documents, tools, and artifacts that provide clear specifications, assurances, and systems to monitor and manage the data exchange between parties.\n\nWe now live in a world where the amount of new data created each day, structured by complex data architecture, rests comfortably in the quintillions of bytes. In this world, where business leaders work to enable digital transformation initiatives and more data-driven decision-making, data contracts are proving to be invaluable.\n\nHow do data contacts work?\n\nIn practice, the formal agreement that data contracts represent will marshal the exchange, handling, storage, and usage of data. Contracting parties agree to ensure that any data outlined in the contract is managed accurately and securely, remaining in compliance with relevant regulations.Â\n\nThese agreements arenât hypothetical. A contract only works if it can be enforced. This is why data contracts that involve software should be programmatic.Â\n\nOperationally, contracts will commonly include the following:\n\nSchema definitions: A data contract should explicitly define the schema, including semantics, so the structure of data is clear. As part of a contract, schema definitions may involve specifying which formats, structures (e.g., Avro or JSON), and data types will be used.\n\nValidation rules: These rules make sure all ensuing data adheres to the defined schema and will meet data quality standards the contracting parties require.\n\nAccess control: Data contracts may specify who approved data producers and data consumers will be for the duration of time specified within the contract.\n\nData flow management: Contracts typically outline how datasets should flow between specific systems like data pipelines and data ingestion processes. They may also determine how data should be managed as it moves between contracting parties, such as data engineers and software engineers.\n\nCommunication protocols: API specifications and communication protocols may also be outlined to standardize the data exchange between systems and platforms.\n\nVersioning: Data contracts implement versioning to manage changes made to the data schema. This management ensures that all changes, including breaking changes, will be handled in a way that wonât disrupt existing systems.\n\nDependency and metadata management: To make sure changes donât negatively impact dependent systems, dependencies between different data entities may also be managed as part of a data contract. Data contracts may also dictate how metadata will be managed and exchanged between systems, ensuring data will be understandable and usable.\n\nCompliance and auditing: Data contracts will ensure that all data exchange and management adhere to legal and compliance requirements. Mechanisms for auditing and tracking data usage and changes can also be specified.\n\nError handling: Finally, as much as data contracts work to make sure things go right, they should also guide responses when things go wrong. Defining how errors and discrepancies in data will be handled ensures that any issues that arise will be logged, addressed, and communicated properly.\n\nEssential aspects of the contract drafting process\n\nHaving defined what a data contract is and what it should typically entail, we can turn to how theyâre implemented.\n\nWhile implementation specifics of a data contract will certainly vary from case to case, the blend of technical, organizational, and governance practices will, more or less, consist of the following nine aspects:\n\n1. Objectives and parameters\n\nEffective data contracts begin with defining the landscape in which theyâll operate. At their most basic, these landscapes should include all relevant stakeholders and use cases to which the contract will pertain.\n\nAs part of the stakeholder identification process, itâs important to understand their needs and challenges. Use cases can contain as much or as little detail deemed necessary, but should at least include the specific data requirements of both data producers and data consumers. With this foundational information, the ideal duration of the data contract can also be outlined.\n\n2. Schema design and management\n\nNext, a clear and comprehensive scheme should be defined using formats like YAML, JSON, or Avro to detail data structure, formats, and types. However, know that the data contract does not need to describe the entire data schema. Comprehensive as it relates to data contracts refers to everything that will be useful and can be well-owned.Â\n\nDoing so ensures schema changes that occur over the course of the contract will not disrupt existing systems. Further, contract parties should align how metadata will be managed to ensure valuable context about data will be accurate and accessible.\n\n3. Data quality assurance\n\nValidation rules can then be established to ensure optimal data quality and consistency. Take email for instanceâare we validating that information entered in an email field is actually a real address? Or are we employing value-based validation, ensuring for example that numbers added to an age field are never less than zero?\n\nData quality metrics should also be identified at this time. Doing so ensures all parties agree on how the data quality will be defined, which metrics will be monitored, and the role the data contract will play in ensuring adherence to these standards.\n\nWhile this step may seem straightforward, it shouldnât be undervaluedâespecially considering the humbling costs poor data quality enacts on businesses each year.\n\n4. Technical implementation\n\nBased on the constraint, different enforcements of the contract, such as those involving SQL queries, will be needed depending on the technologies used. This makes sense as, for example, the actualities of protecting against NULLS in a database like MySQL will differ from checking value constraints in Kafka.\n\nAPI design should also be accounted for, as needed. If APIs will be used for data exchange, they should be designed to follow GraphQL or RESTful principles, as per requirements.\n\nA format like JSON or Avro will need to be chosen for appropriate data serialization. Plans to implement robust data ingestion mechanisms and data pipelines that will handle data flow also need to be outlined.\n\n5. SLA, security, and compliance\n\nSpecifics regarding data quality, latency, and availability will be clearly defined and minted in the data contractâs SLA. Any service-level agreement will also require monitoring to ensure adherence by all contracting parties. Monitoring and detection pre-deployment here is also essential for identifying any post-implementation issues proactively.\n\nSecurity factors should involve the use of access control mechanisms that will regulate who can produce and consume data. The contract should clearly establish how data management and data exchange will comply with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements. Working in parallel, outlined data governance policies can further guide data management throughout its lifecycle.\n\n6. Communication, error handling, and resolution\n\nData contracts should be authored to facilitate collaboration between data engineers, other data teams, and data consumers affected by the contract. This collaboration relies on clear lines of communication being established and maintained among stakeholders. Moreover, providing as much context as possible bi-directionally helps teams changing the contract understand why constraints are needed while keeping consumers aware of how and when updates are being made.Â\n\nCommunication is key for managing expectations and providing the right updates at the right time throughout the course of the contract. That said, a data contract should at least include the basics of how productive lines of communication will be established and maintainedâand who is responsible for doing so. Error logging and a defined resolution workflow must be established as part of the drafting process. Contract owners should also be alerted if the contract itself is ever violated.Â\n\n7. Documentation and changes\n\nWhile the contract is being drafted, the formalities of robust documentation and change management must also be captured. While both are important parts of the data contract process, each is its own distinct element. They support the contract by providing clarity and the framework for managing changes and maintaining records.Â\n\nDocumentation during the course of the data contract should be a clear and clearly accessible chronicle of operating facets of the data contract, including schemas and workflows.\n\nChanges in the data contract or schema should be recorded separately to ensure they can be communicated to stakeholders as needed.Â\n\n8. Continuous improvement\n\nAs a data contract actively guides the use of data in a given situation, feedback loops need to be established with data consumers and producers. Feedback provides valuable information that can be used to continuously improve how the data contract functions.\n\nFeedback loops also enable contracting parties to adopt an iteration approach to making these improvements, gradually enhancing and refining the data contract as needs evolve.\n\n9. Technology, tooling, and testing\n\nWith the previous aspects defined, appropriate tools and technologies can be chosen to put the contract to work. Automation should be implemented if and when possible in order to streamline the data management and validation processes.\n\nOnce completed, data contracts require thorough testing to ensure they meet all requirements and handle edge cases effectively. This testing should also validate the performance of data exchange mechanisms under various loads and scenarios.\n\nThree use cases for data contracts\n\nFinally, to stitch the why of data contracts together with their respective what and hows, the following three distinct use cases illustrate their importance and application in practice.\n\nReal-time data streaming in financial services\n\nItâs increasingly common for financial institutions to rely on real-time data streamingâessential for making instantaneous decisions related to trading, fraud detection, and customer service.\n\nBut, with stakes this high, data must be accurate, timely, and reliable. Data discrepancies or delays can cripple decision-making and lead to financial losses.\n\nIn this use case, data contracts provide the following:\n\nAccuracy: The schema that data contracts define can ensure that data is both available and guaranteed to adhere to expected formats.\n\nSLA management: The data contract will ensure that data latency remains within acceptable parameters and selected data sources will be able to provide and process data as needed.\n\nSecurity: The contract will also make sure that sensitive financial data remains secure while transmitted, and that it can only be authorized to approved entities and individuals.\n\nCollaborative data ecosystems in healthcare\n\nHealthcare ecosystems present their own substantial regulatory and privacy concerns, as stakeholders such as doctors, hospitals, insurance companies, and research institutions need to share sensitive patient data to function at their best.\n\nThe challenges here then involve not just data privacy and consistency, but also extensive interoperability required among diverse systems to ensure compliance with regulations like HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act).\n\nIn this use case, data contracts provide the following:\n\nData quality: In this case, the data contract will ensure that data shared among entities will be accurate and reliableâessential for both patient care and research.\n\nData privacy and compliance: Data contracts define how sensitive health data can be handled, which then ensures compliance with regulatory and legal requirements.\n\nInteroperability and dependency management: Data contracts ensure not only the consistency and interoperability necessary in healthcare ecosystems but can also manage dependencies between diverse systems and stakeholders.Â\n\nSupply chain management in retail\n\nRetailers engage with supply chains that can consist of a huge network of logistics providers, manufacturers, and suppliers. Doing so enables retailers to keep products manufactured, transported, and stocked efficiently.\n\nWith 74% of supply chain leaders reporting increasing their investment in technology and innovation in 2023, the need to guarantee traceability, transparency, and efficiency within retail supply chains increasingly hinges on the availability of consistent, high-quality data.\n\nIn this use case, data contracts provide the following:\n\nData integration: With so many players involved in even basic retail supply chains, data contracts can facilitate the integration of data across all relevant entities, ensuring data is both consistent and accessible.\n\nTransparency and traceability: Data contracts are instrumental in defining data related to product movement, timelines, and quantities. This ensures the complicated journey products take from manufacturer to retailer remains traceable and transparent.\n\nAutomation: Contracts also govern a seamless flow of data across the entire supply chain which, in turn, enables automation and real-time decision-making.\n\nWhat goes around comes around\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of data management, the age-old wisdom of thought leaders like Benjamin Franklin remains strikingly relevant. If âan ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,â the importance of proactive measures in data handling cannot be overstated.Â\n\nData contracts, as highlighted in this article, serve as that crucial ounce of prevention, safeguarding businesses from potential pitfalls and ensuring seamless data operations. As we move forward in this digital age, the value of such preventive measures only increases.Â",
      "# [Data Provenance: Why Data Needs a Prequel, Not Just Sequels](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-provenance)\nThe amount of data swarming throughout our daily lives increases exponentially. For this reason, data quality is becoming a frequently discussed topic. Bring it on, we say.Â\n\nBut as data quality (and big data more generally) is discussed more often, itâs imperative that we all understand and employ key terms related to data management and data governance the same way.\n\nData provenanceâthe term, concept, and practiceâshould be toward the top of oneâs list. For forward-thinking organizations working to improve data quality and use, the provenance of data plays a key role in ensuring the integrity, reliability, and value of all data handled.\n\nWhat is data provenance?\n\nData provenance refers to the information (often metadata) that traces the origin and movement of data throughout the data life cycle. Ideally, this information encompasses the history of specific dataâwhere it came from, the processes and methodologies undergone since origination, and changes of ownership and structure along the way.\n\nThis information is essential for compliance with regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which requires clear data audit trails. Additionally, this information aids in reproducing scientific research, validating experimental results, and managing the ever-increasing complexity and volume of metadata.\n\nIn this way, data provenance is similar to data lineage because the information is essential for ensuring data authenticity, integrity, and reliability. This makes both data lineage and provenance vitally important across industries and applications, from supporting the service quality and operational efficiency of massive telecommunications companies to case-by-case applications in business analytics.\n\nDespite the similarities between data provenance and lineage, they are distinct concepts. Whatâs more, applying data provenance as a process further distinguishes it from its contextual cousin. So, letâs use an entertaining analogy to ensure we understand how to give provenance its due.\n\nHow are data provenance and data lineage different?\n\nTo help draw a clearer distinction between data provenance and lineage, consider this basic use case:\n\nA business intelligence (BI) team in a large organization needs to generate some reports to aid in executive decision-making.\n\nOne humble data engineer, our hero, compiles relevant customer data (i.e., customer profiles, demographics, shopper behavior) into a dataset and delivers it to the BI team, as requested.\n\nWith the data in hand, the BI team plugs the dataset into a data visualization tool and begins analyzing it, hunting for trends and insights.\n\nLetâs visualize this use case through a cinematic lens (pun intended). The BI team, scouring that customer data for said trends and insights? Thatâs a movie (you choose the genre).\n\nThis movie has a prequel. Thatâs data provenance: all the unique backstory, characters, and formative events that, together, made the dataset what it is today. The data provenance here would include all processes and methodologies the data engineer used to collect, cleanse, and transform customer data from multiple data producers pre-delivery.\n\nChances are good that our main movie will also have a sequel or two. Any and all sequels will be data lineageâchronicling the continued adventures of the dataset as the plot and characters flow on and progress through various systems, data consumers, and subsequent use cases.\n\nSo, as different yet equally valuable facets of data management, provenance and lineage help engineers, analysts, auditors, and administrators answer different types of questions.\n\nData provenance answers these questions:\n\nWho created this data, and when?\n\nHow was this data initially collected/generated?\n\nWhat standards and methodologies were used to collect this data?\n\nWhat is the original data source?\n\nData lineage answers these questions:\n\nWhich processes or systems did this data come from?\n\nWhat transformations has this data undergone?\n\nWhere will it go next?\n\nHow will this data be applied in downstream processes and systems?\n\nHow data professionals put data provenance to work\n\n1. Ensuring data integrity and authenticity\n\nIf data is the new oil, data quality is its sweetness (i.e., âsweet crude,â dataâs relative value). Data provenance provides a comprehensive history of data that includes sources of the data, changes that were made to it, and who made the changes. This historical record becomes essential for helping teams verify the authenticity and integrity of organizational data. When data quality can be verified, that data can be trustedâapplicable for reporting, analysis, and decision-making.\n\n2. Supporting data quality\n\nTherefore, data provenance is intrinsically linked to data qualityâproviding the context needed for data teams to assess the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of their data. When the history of data is clear, teams can more easily identify the root causes of data issues if, or when, they arise. This reduces the time needed to implement corrective measures, helping to maintain high data quality over time.\n\n3. Facilitating compliance and auditing\n\nIndustries are increasingly subject to data privacy and security regulations that require fastidious data management and record-keeping practices. Data provenance ensures organizations keep data compliant and secure by providing a verifiable trail of its data origins and transformations.\n\nThis makes provenance a key contributor to audit trailsâwhen data teams need to demonstrate compliance with specific regulations and laws, avoiding penalties and damage to organizational reputation.\n\n4. Enhancing transparency and accountability\n\nThe micro to complianceâs macro, day-to-day use and reliance on data requires ongoing transparency and accountability. The audit trail of a piece of data that provenance enables also fosters trust and accessibility among data users and stakeholders, ensuring all parties are confident in the validity of the data used to do their jobs.\n\n5. Improving data security\n\nData provenance allows data teams to make sure the logs they use to track data maintain access and that changes are immutable. As such, these logs can significantly improve cybersecurity. Potential security issues can be quickly identified and responded to, protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access and breaches.\n\n6. Enhancing decision-making\n\nIt borders on the unavoidable; data is, in one way or another, informing most of the critical decisions made in organizations today. Therefore, data teams must guarantee all data used in the decision-making process is reliable and has not been inadvertently altered or tampered with. This goes a long way toward ensuring data is informing, not misinforming, decisions destined to drive business success.\n\n7. Increasing research reproducibility and validity\n\nFinally, among research, analyst, and scientific communities, data provenance is crucial to ensure the reproducibility and validity of studies. Provenance allows researchers to trace the origin of research data, understand any applied methodologies, and evaluate the integrity of their findings.\n\nThis traceability is essential for building robust, verifiable evidence and facilitating peer review and collaboration.\n\nKey characteristics of a well-defined data provenance system\n\nA well-defined data provenance system will be meticulously designed to track data as it is collected, transformed, and used throughout its data life cycle.\n\nWhat follows is a sense of how such systems work in practice and what sets well-defined data provenance systems apart.\n\nComprehensive data capture: Well-defined data provenance systems should automatically log detailed information about the dataâs origin, transformations, and states throughout its life cycle. These details should include metadata, system processes, user inputs, and external interactions. Capturing detailed contextual information is key.\n\nData management tool integration: To avoid potential gaps in data tracking, data provenance systems should seamlessly integrate with existing data management systems (e.g., databases, data lakes, ETL tools). Seamless integration ensures all transformations and movements are logged without manual entry.\n\nGranular data tracking: Provenance systems should track data at a granular level, including individual data elements or records. This provides data teams with precise traceability and allows for detailed data history analysis. This is especially important when organizational data needs to undergo complex analysis or auditing.\n\nAutomated workflows for compliance and auditing: To avoid manual or reactive compliance or auditing, well-defined data provenance systems should include automated workflows to generate reports or alerts for anomalies.\n\nData integrity and security measures: These systems implement robust security measures to protect data and its provenance while helping to ensure its integrity. These measures typically include encryption, access controls, and regular integrity checks.\n\nUser-friendly access and visualization: As with other aspects of data management, information from data provenance systems should not be limited to technical users or rely on formats that are hard for stakeholders throughout the company to understand. User-friendly interfaces and visualization tools allow a wide range of professionals to easily access and interpret provenance data, increasing its value organization-wide.\n\nWhy data provenance and prequels both deserve a better script\n\nWhen the stakes are high, whether for data provenance or a movie prequel, script quality becomes vitally important.\n\nIn addition to establishing important story details, settings, and narrative elements, a prequel script needs to address more practical mattersâlike introducing key characters, budgetary constraints, and high audience expectations.\n\nA well-drafted data contract serves this purpose when relating to data provenance and data management in general. It handles source details, data handling specifications, quality requirements, and regulatory clauses.",
      "# [Data Collaboration: What Working Better Together Really Entails](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-collaboration)\nIt only takes a Google search (or a hot minute or two on LinkedIn) to find a long list of modern data trends:\n\nBig data and the mind-bogglingly explosive volume of it all. Competitive pressures across industries as more organizations endeavor to digitally transform. Machine learning and the use of AI becoming the rule, not the exception. The push towards data democratization. Globalization, distributed teams, and increasingly stringent and complex digital privacy governance and regulations.\n\nActing as a force multiplier, data collaboration can dramatically increase the effectiveness of organizational efforts and systems without the need for additional resources, effort, or investment. That said, there exists an exceptional amount of pressure on data engineers to get data collaboration right within their organizations.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nAll of this leads to a central truth: Itâs imperative that organizations both understand and embrace what data collaboration is, how it functions to benefit an organization, why data engineers should begin their own collaboration initiatives by looking outside their profession, and best practices that can help facilitate success.\n\nWhat is data collaboration?\n\nData collaboration is the process or practice of sharing, managing, and working on data across different teams, departments, or even entire organizations to achieve common goals in a coordinated and strategic manner. These goals can vary but often relate to an organization wanting to increase data integration to make better decisions, improve personalization and customer experiences, or increase operational efficiency.\n\nBased on these goals, data collaboration may be applied on a case-by-case basis or implemented as a fundamental aspect of how an organization functions. But to fully understand (and appreciate) data collaboration, we must go beyond its technical definition and touch on the complicated interplay it relies upon and enables in data-driven ecosystems.Â\n\nData sharing, one of the main aspects of data collaboration, will often involve combining datasets (i.e., collections of data) from different departments within an organization and external data producers.\n\nPartnerships between departments and external sources will be unique to an organization, as differing business outcomes may require data sharing with a variety of data sourcesâsuppliers, consultants, customers, research institutions, or other businesses. This diversity is important, as this pooling of resources and knowledge enriches data, leading to better, more comprehensive insights.\n\nApplication programming interfaces (APIs) play a vital role in facilitating the connection and communication between all the differing software applications data providers bring to the table. Workflows ensure data sets are collected, processed, analyzed, and utilized accurately and efficiently. And visualization tools like dashboards play a vital role, enabling data collaborators to more easily monitor, report, and make decisions based on their enriched data.\n\nBut the value data collaboration creates canât come at the expense of data security. Data accessâand stakeholders maintaining control of their data throughout the data collaboration processâis essential. So data teams must stringently manage permissions, controlling access at various levels to ensure these newly created datasets remain compliant and abide by all relevant privacy regulations.\n\nWhile the above only scratches the surface of the complexities involved, it sheds light on the interplay required to successfully implement data collaboration to drive insights, innovation, and improved business performance.\n\nThe benefits of data collaboration\n\nAgain, there are as many potential benefits of data collaboration as ways of using data. In general, within an organization, these typically include better organizational knowledge and skill development, more creativity, innovation, and better cross-functional alignment,\n\nHowever, for an organization's more technical practitioners, beneficial use cases may specifically include the following:\n\nEnhanced data change management processes\n\nRobust data collaboration helps ensure any and all changes to data structures, formats, and usage are systematically recorded, reviewed, and implemented with full visibility.\n\nThe resulting transparency and accessibility facilitates clearer communication among data stakeholders. In this way, data collaboration also improves the traceability of changes and better compliance with data governance standards.\n\nImproved dependency alerting\n\nData collaboration also enables dependency alerting to become more accurate and proactive. In turn, the organization can benefit from earlier identification of potential issues, more agility to respond to changes, and minimized impact of said changes on dependent processes or systems.\n\nHighly collaborative teams may also find it easier to automate alerts that notify relevant data consumers in real time about changes in the data they depend on.\n\nChange request centralization\n\nBusiness environments are increasingly dynamic, meaning that change requests can come from anywhere in the organization (and at any time). Data collaboration also benefits here as it can centralize the process of requesting changes to data or data practices. Further, the requests themselves become more structured and efficient.\n\nChange requests submitted through a centralized platform enable teams to log, prioritize, and address each in a timely manner. Overall, this can make an organizationâs data management strategy more adaptive.\n\nFaster detection and response to broken data pipelines\n\nIn addition to consistently producing better solutions, collaborative data analysis can help teams identify issues before they become problems (and fix problems before they create issues). As a result, teams (not just individuals) get better at analyzing and interpreting trends, patterns, correlations, and anomalies related to their data pipelines over time.\n\nThis also means that when a pipeline does break down, the collaborative team is better equipped to drill down into an issue faster, decreasing time-to-resolution.\n\nData models evolve more effectively\n\nData models enjoy enhanced flexibility and scalability thanks to robust data collaboration. This fosters an environment where stakeholder feedback, insights, and emerging needs are better integrated into the evolution of data models.\n\nAdditionally, the improved alignment with business goals and increased ability to leverage new data sources often improves the effectiveness of data-driven initiatives.\n\nImproved potency of data contracts\n\nAs a final benefit of note, while drafting data contracts, highly collaborative organizations enjoy more opportunities to reduce misunderstandings or potential conflicts regarding their data use.\n\nData contracts are drafted, agreed on, and maintained with contributions from all relevant parties. As such, they enter service optimally comprehensive, clear, and aligned with the needs of all stakeholdersâfacilitating smoother data exchanges and integration efforts.\n\nThe valuable (and somewhat counterintuitive) starting point for successful data collaboration initiatives\n\nMelvin Conway is well-known among software developers for Conwayâs Law: âAny organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.â As noted by the author, speaker, and software developer Martin Fowler, this axiom is important enough âto affect every system [heâs] come across, and powerful enough that you're doomed to defeat if you try to fight it.âÂ\n\nThereâs something immutable to this ideaâthat the things we make are invariably shaped by the ways we make themâwhich is why Conwayâs Law can, and should, serve as a potent starting point for data engineers to champion data collaboration best practices in their own organizations.Â\n\nHereâs why:\n\nData engineering often requires an extensive focus on technical proficiency and system optimization. Engineers typically work on specific systems or components within larger organizational architectures.Â\n\nIn these cases, user experience or user-centric design may naturally take a back seat, while the predominant roles and goals of the data engineer may not include a deep understanding of the broader dynamics at play within an organization, especially how these dynamics pertain to data flow and usage. For engineers looking to head up or bolster a data collaboration initiative, these factors can lead to several blindspots.\n\nRephrased for the context at hand, Conwayâs Law could instead read as follows: âIn organizations where data engineers are tasked with implementing data collaboration initiatives, the structure and effectiveness of these initiatives will mirror the communication patterns and organizational structures within the company.\"\n\nAs such, embracing our take on Conwayâs Law grounds the data engineer in a mindset where cross-functional collaboration needs to be championed in addition to the technical aspects of data systems.Â\n\nDespite the complexity and time invested in existing projects, the engineer must realize that the organizational change inherent in data collaboration necessitates adaptations in data systems, with an emphasis on flexibility and scalability.\n\nAnd, as part of true collaboration, the pursuit of technical solutions canât overtake the need for clear data governance structures that both support and mirror the overall communication and decision-making processes of the organization.\n\nWith this important keystone of collaboration in place, data engineers can employ best practices knowing that the foundation theyâre building on is immutable as the law that informs it.\n\nBest practices for implementing data collaboration\n\nThere exists a healthy bit of overlap for how best to implement a data process or practice. Since data quality is a foundational requirement for all data activities, it should be viewed and treated as a product, not a commodity. Clear governance and policies need to be established to ensure data is shared and used correctly.\n\nThere are, however, a few best practices specific to successful data collaboration:\n\n1. Encourage cross-functional collaboration\n\nActively break down organizational silos (data silos, departmental silos, etc.) in order to foster collaboration across different departments and teams. Whatever their justification, siloing stifles the diverse data and sources that productive collaboration hinges on.\n\n2. Promote transparency and open communication\n\nWhile important in all areas, everyone involved in data collaboration, be it a project or process, needs to be accountable for promoting transparency and open communication. Build on the clear policies and guidelines established through governance. Establish feedback mechanisms. Recognize and reward openness as data collaboration begins to thrive.\n\n3. Invest in people and processes before tools and technologies\n\nIn data engineering, prioritizing tools and technologies is common. But that doesnât make it correct. Due to the complexity and scale of data collaboration in organizations, even the tech provides diminishing returns without skilled personnel operating within a robust framework of efficient, adaptable processes. It will be the people and processes that begin to cultivate a culture of collaboration, one where technology serves an organizationâs goals (as opposed to dictating them).\n\nFrom Conway to contracts: Why collaborative success hinges on better beginnings\n\nFor those seeking to harness the full potential of their data through data collaboration, the implementation of data contracts inevitably emerges as a pivotal tool. These contracts serve as a blueprint ensuring clarity, consistency, and compliance in the collaborative process, much like architectural plans in building design.\n\nAs we navigate the intricate landscape of data collaboration, the value of well-defined data contracts cannot be overstated. They are the cornerstone of effective data management, enabling organizations to unlock the true power of their data assets.Â",
      "# [Database Schema: The Need for (and Risks of) Iterative Evolution](https://www.gable.ai/blog/database-schema)\nThe humble, foundational aspects of data environments make it possible for modern tools, solutions, and platforms to scale and adapt to our ever-evolving digital world.\n\nAnd while itâs understandable that an abundance of digital ink will be spilled to cover new frontiers, letâs not forget that said foundational aspects and their need to keep pace are just as important, if not more so.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nFor organizations of all sizes, database schema serves as a critical blueprint that dictates the functional structure of data management.\n\nThis is especially true for startups and smaller organizations, where data can be a significant driver of innovation and growth.\n\nDatabase schema, defined\n\nA database schema acts as the blueprint within a relational database management system (DBMS), outlining its logical structure and organization. Schemas are often defined using data definition language (DDL), which provides a clear, consistent way to define how data is stored in tables.\n\nDatabase schemas also define the relationships between these tables, incorporating integrity constraints to establish and maintain optimal data quality. Such organization makes efficient data retrieval, query optimization, and overall performance management possible, playing a crucial role in database design and operation.\n\nTo do so, database schema typically encompasses a wide range of database objects (but certainly not all of them). Schema primarily focuses on the specific database objects needed to define a given databaseâs structure and organization.\n\nTypically, these objects will include the following:\n\nTables: The core components of a database schema, tables store data in rows and columns, with each table representing a set of related data.\n\nIn the context of data warehouses or multidimensional database models, schemas often include more specialized âfact tables.â These specialized tables are designed to store quantitative data for analysis, known as facts, and often contain keys that link to related dimension tables, which store descriptive attributes.\n\nColumns: Within tables, columns (also known as fields) represent the attributes or properties of the data. Each column in a table is designed to store a specific type of data (e.g., integers, text, dates, etc.).\n\nRows: Individual records in a table are represented as rows, where each row in a table contains unique data for the corresponding columns.\n\nPrimary keys: These are special fields that uniquely identify each record in a table. A primary key ensures that each row in a table is distinct from all others.\n\nForeign keys: Fields in a table that link to primary keys in other tables are called foreign keys. These keys establish relationships between tables and are crucial for maintaining referential integrity within a database.\n\nIndexes: Functioning as an âaddress bookâ of sorts, indexes guide databases to the location of needed data more quickly. This functionality speeds up overall data retrieval from the database.\n\nStored procedures and functions: These are sets of SQL statements that perform tasks like calculations and data manipulation that are frequently reused.\n\nViews: A view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement. Just like a real table, views contain rows and columns. However, views are created with the data from one or more tables.\n\nConstraints: Constraints are rules that ensure the data in the database remains accurate and reliable.\n\nTriggers: Scripts that are automatically executed in response to certain events are referred to as triggers on a particular table or view in the database.\n\nAll together, these are the components that enable schema to function as the metaphorical blueprint, keeping databases optimally structured as their data is stored, organized, and managed.\n\nA note on schema types: While they often focus on similar data objects, different schemas may vary depending on the nature of the data being used and the requirements of their respective systems. In exploring the types of database schemas, database administrators may use a conceptual or logical schema during the planning phase.\n\nHowever, they may transition to a physical schema for implementation and then a physical database schema to manage the physical aspects of the database when itâs put into use. Data scientists and business analysts, on the other hand, might rely on star schema to enable complex queries or snowflake schema if data integrity and reduction of data redundancy take precedence.\n\nThe need for iterative schema evolution\n\nIterative schema evolution is a critical aspect of successfully implementing and managing a database, particularly in dynamic environments where business requirements and data models are subject to change. Its importance can be understood in relation to other key factors in database management:\n\nAdaptability to changing requirements: One of the most significant challenges in database management is the continuous need to adapt to evolving business needs. Iterative schema evolution allows for gradual, controlled modifications to the database schema, ensuring that it can keep pace with changing requirements without disrupting ongoing operations.\n\nData integrity and consistency: While maintaining data integrity and consistency is vital, overly rigid schema designs can hinder necessary changes. Iterative schema evolution, when done correctly, allows for schema modifications while maintaining data integrity through versioning, migration scripts, and backward compatibility.\n\nPerformance optimization: Over time, it's common for the performance requirements of a given database to change. Iterative schema evolution enables incremental adjustments to optimize performance, such as indexing strategies and partitioning, without the need for a complete overhaul.\n\nScalability: As the volume of data grows, a database schema might need to be adjusted to scale effectively. Iterative evolution allows for scaling-related changes, such as denormalization or sharding, to be implemented as needed.\n\nCompatibility with development practices: Modern development practices, such as Agile and DevOps, emphasize continuous improvement and rapid iteration. Iterative schema evolution aligns well with these methodologies, allowing database schema changes to be integrated into the broader development lifecycle.\n\nRisk management: By enabling small, incremental changes, iterative schema evolution reduces the risk associated with large-scale database modifications. It allows for easier rollback, testing, and validation of changes.\n\nThe risks of iterative schema evolution\n\nAttempting to enable iterative schema evolution without a data contract in place does, unfortunately, present several challenges and risks.\n\nThese risks are amplified in environments where data integrity, consistency, and compliance are crucial:\n\nLack of predictability and standardization: Without support, changes to the data schema can occur in an ad-hoc, inconsistent manner. The unpredictability this introduces can lead to issues in data quality and compatibility, especially when logical constraints are not uniformly applied across multiple teams or systems.\n\nData integrity risks: Sporadic schema changes can lead to data integrity issues. If a field's data type is altered without proper synchronization, for example, it could lead to data loss or corruption.\n\nCompliance violations: In regulated industries or under laws like GDPR or CCPA, organizational data needs to be handled according to specific guidelines. Iterative schema changes can inadvertently lead to non-compliance, resulting in legal and financial repercussions.\n\nIncreased testing and validation overhead: Schema changes require extensive testing and validation to ensure they donât break existing systems. While important, this process becomes more complex and time-consuming as a database needs to evolve, as there are no predefined rules or expectations to test against.\n\nDependency management issues: In a microservices architecture or in systems with multiple data sources, changes in one part often affect others. Managing these dependencies over time compounds testing complexity while the subsequent risks of system failures or downtime increase.\n\nDifficulty in rollbacks: If a schema change leads to issues, a rollback may be required. However, this operation becomes difficult when no record of the previous schema state is available, or when data may have already been transformed in a way that is not easily reversible.\n\nImpact on data consumers: Applications or services consuming the data may face issues if they are not aware of or prepared for schema changes. This can lead to system errors, application crashes, or incorrect data processing.\n\nScaling challenges: As an organizationâs systems scale, managing schema evolution takes an increasing toll on data teams. Moreover, as the volume of organizational data and the number of interconnected services increases, the complexity and risk of making changes without breaking existing functionalities also grows exponentially.\n\nWhy your database blueprints deserve their own blueprint\n\nData leaders in organizations of all sizes need to embrace the reality that their database will need to evolve. Therefore, any means or method that can mitigate the risks of iterative schema evolution should be embraced as well.\n\nEnter data contracts. For database designers and data engineers, these contracts can support the design of a database schema, not just its management.\n\nData contracts: Advantages for schema design\n\n1. Defining data structure and format\n\nEarly specification: Data contracts can provide an early specification of the data structure, including data types, formats, and fields, guiding the normalization process in database design. This helps in designing database tables and relationships that align with these specifications.\n\nConsistency across systems: When a database needs to interact with other systems, a data contract ensures that the schema is designed in a way that is compatible and consistent with these external systems.\n\n2. Setting standards and constraints\n\nData integrity: By defining the rules and constraints for data, contracts help in designing schemas that inherently support data integrity and validity.\n\nStandardization: Data contracts often include standardization rules, which are crucial in designing a schema with consistent syntax and structure.\n\n3. Guiding relationships and dependencies\n\nRelationship mapping: Contracts can outline the relationships between different data entities, providing a clear visual representation through an entity-relationship diagram in the schema design process.\n\nDependency management: Understanding the dependencies between different data elements as specified in a contract helps in designing a schema that efficiently manages these dependencies.\n\n4. Facilitating scalability and evolution\n\nFuture-proofing: Data contracts can include provisions for future changes, which can guide the design of a flexible and scalable schema.\n\nIterative development: As contracts may evolve, designing a schema with the ability to accommodate these changes is crucial. Data contracts provide guidelines on how the schema should adapt, ensuring it remains relevant and functional over time.\n\n5. Ensuring compliance and security\n\nCompliance: Data contracts often outline requirements for compliance with regulations. This can be integrated into the schema design to ensure that data storage and processing meet legal standards.\n\nSecurity protocols: Contracts may specify security protocols or encryption standards, which can be considered in the schema design to ensure data is stored and accessed securely.\n\n6. Data governance\n\nGovernance framework: Data contracts often form part of a broader data governance strategy. Designing a schema with these contracts in mind helps align it with the organization's data governance policies, ensuring the effective organization of data.\n\nRole and access management: Data contracts may define roles and access levels for database users, which can influence the design of the schema in terms of access controls and data segregation.\n\n7. Optimizing performance and efficiency\n\nPerformance requirements: Contracts can specify performance requirements, guiding the design of efficient indexes, optimized query paths, and streamlined data structures.\n\nResource management: Understanding the expected data load and usage patterns from the contract can guide decisions on resource allocation and optimization in the schema design.\n\nReady to support your own database schemas? Hereâs how to get started\n\nCompared to larger organizations, smaller organizations and startups often require wearing multiple hats, achieving more with less, and just doing what it takes to get the work done. Thatâs why itâs simply not worth leaving database schema unsupported, which effectively creates little ticking time bombs tucked away in some of the most vulnerable aspects of your data infrastructure.\n\nFortunately, weâre improving the process required to draft and implement a top-notch data contract, in part because everyone in our data-driven world (not just enterprise organizations) deserves the security and operational support they provide.\n\nReserve your spot now to learn more about Gable and how you can create a preventative strategy with data contracts.\n\nâ",
      "# [Data Lineage: Breakdowns, Book Publishers, and Best Practices](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-lineage)\nWhen data becomes more complex, big data analytics also becomes more complexâand, in turn, data compliance and regulations are even more complex.Â\n\nAnd this all ripples to affect the complexity of data governance.Â\n\nWhile data-driven decision-making actually becomes easier, maintaining competitive data advantages becomes more difficult. Access to quality data is already vital, but understanding how an organization uses that quality data is now essential.Â\n\nEnter: Data lineage.\n\nWhat is data lineage?\n\nData lineage refers to how specific data is used and transformed over time. Data professionals employ data lineage practices to record and share this data use and transformation as it occurs.\n\nTime out: How is data lineage different from data provenance and data governance?\n\nOne of the challenges of data management is that you canât break out aspects of the data lifecycle and affix each to specific periods of timeâpast, present, or future.Â\n\nThis is why we sometimes find data, especially in large complex systems, to be a perceptual challenge. We canât cleanly break it down into easily categorical chunks. For this reason, it can seem like all data (e.g., data flows, data assets, data environments, etc.) can, at times, be proverbially everything, everywhere, all at once.\n\nHowever, with dataâs growing role in our lives, itâs important everyone works to understand these fundamental aspects of data managementâas our collective ability to ensure data security, compliance, and data-driven decision-making relies on it.\n\nFortunately, we can use our new book on data contracts (now available in early release from our friends at OâReilly Media) as an illustrated example of how provenance, governance, and lineage all relate.\n\nProvenance: Data Contracts: Developing Production-Grade Pipelines at Scale has two authors and a unique editorial history. The record of this authorship and editorial history over time is like the bookâs data provenance.Â\n\nGovernance: Our publisher, OâReilly, sets forth specific guidelines and standardsâa prescribed frameworkâdetermining how the book should be used, secured, and maintained. These guidelines and standards also ensure the level of quality the book must aspire to. As such, this framework acts as the bookâs governance.\n\nLineage: Finally, we want the book to find its way into the hands of people who will love it. Our distribution plan to make this happen can be mapped (i.e., tracked)âclearly showing how the book goes on to reach readers, where it is sent (both on and offline), who distributes it, and how it moves through various systems and processes as a distinct body of work. This map is the bookâs lineage, and as such, the map becomes essential for troubleshooting, measuring the bookâs impact, and analyzing any dependencies related to it.Â\n\nWhile the above hopefully parses the different roles that provenance, governance, and lineage play in effective data management, our hope is that it also illustrates their interdependenciesâhow each of the three functionalities improves the other two when orchestrated together.\n\n9 Common types of data lineage\n\nNow that weâve simplified things, letâs go ahead and complicate them again (just a bit).Â\n\nIn data management, there are many different kinds of data lineage. There need to beâbecause different stakeholders and departments within an organization can use the same data in very different ways. And knowing everything about all data all the time isnât necessary (despite what that one data analyst two cubicles over would have you believe).Â\n\nDepending on these varying user requirements and perspectives, some aspects, dimensions, and attributes will make more sense to map in one instance, and less (or not at all) in another. To this, other factors determining what should or should not be mentioned include data complexity, regulatory compliance, data governance, and strategy, among others. This leads us to nine common types of data lineage in use across organizations.\n\nBackward lineage: This type of data lineage traces the data flow from a given point back to its point of origin. Doing so can help data teams verify data quality related to different data outputs (e.g., data sets, reports, analytics results, etc.).Â\n\nForward lineage: By tracing data flow from a given point to its final destination, teams can evaluate the relevance and value of data inputs and measure the impact of changes to data or alterations enacted upon it.Â\n\nHorizontal lineage: The flow of data across different systems, platforms, and applications is mapped using horizontal data lineageâshowing how data moves, integrates, and transforms between its source and its target. Mapping horizontal lineage also includes the tools and processes involved in these data flows.Â\n\nVertical lineage: Alternately, mapping the verticality of data refers to its flow within a specific system, platform, or application. This information helps data teams understand how data in these locations is structured, stored, and accessed at different layers, including tables, columns, keys, records, fields, and files.Â\n\nEnd-to-end lineage: Teams may also map the horizontal and vertical aspects of data together, referred to as end-to-end lineage. This is done when stakeholders need a holistic view of data provenance, usage, and quality.Â\n\nTable-level lineage and column-level lineage: When a much more detailed form of data tracking is required, table-level lineageâmapped at the table level of databases or systemsâprovides teams with a detailed, macro view of data flow. Viewing the data at the table level can be useful when performing impact analysis, data integrations, migrations, or compliance and auditing.\n\nHowever, data quality management, debugging, or detailed impact analysis can require an even more granular view of data. In these cases, column-level lineage illuminates how data moves between individual columns or fields in a table, shows how that data is altered, and provides a view of its dependencies.\n\nTechnical data lineage: Zooming back out, teams map technical data lineage to broadly track the flow of data as it moves through technical processes and transformations. The details of dataâs journey from data producers to its final destination(s) are key for maintaining data efficiency, integrity, and transparency throughout an organization.Â\n\nOperational data lineage: Additionally, mapping how data is used and accessed in day-to-day business operations provides another way to track how data moves throughout an organization (albeit a slightly broader one). By focusing on operational systems, teams can conduct business impact analysis, compliance, and reporting, and gauge operational efficiency.\n\nBusiness data lineage: Finally, data flowing between business processes can also be mapped. Business data lineage takes less concern with the specifics of what is happening to data. Often utilized by less technical stakeholders, this form of mapping tells the story of how data is impacting the business as a whole.Â\n\nData lineage best practices: Our 9 recommendations\n\nSettling on the right best practices for data lineage is a lot like settling on the best title for a book on data contracts; both are exercises in limitations and precision. (And another good option always pops to mind the moment you think youâre âdone.â)\n\nThat said, we think the following nine best practices, as a whole, accomplish two things:\n\nThey can be used to support the foundational needs for tracking effective data lineage across most organizations.\n\nThey balance these foundational needs with some advanced enhancements.\n\n1. Clarify objectives, tying them to IT and business needs\n\nEstablishing clear objectives before embarking on any initiative, data-related or otherwise, is crucial. In this instance, clarity helps data leaders ensure that all tools, policies, and procedures that make up an organizationâs data lineage practices will be efficient, sustainable, and aligned with ongoing business needs.Â\n\nItâs worth considering how data contracts help you get the most out of this process, as the value of ongoing and tangible evidence of how data lineage practices positively impact an organization over time canât be overstated.\n\n2. Leverage automation to maximize lineage fidelity and scalability\n\nPlan to automate data lineage practices as much as possible. Gaining access to accurate and consistent information is the point, after all. Automation, especially automated data discovery, can play a crucial role here, as it reduces the risks of errors inherent in manual processes.Â\n\nAt the same time, automation promotes scalabilityâensuring that data lineage practices (especially those related to metadata capture and management) remain functionally efficient over time.\n\n3. Vet tool and system integrations\n\nFor most of us tasked with implementing data lineage practices, chances are good an established data environment will already be in operation. Audit existing data management tools based on established objectives, ensuring theyâll contribute to maximizing the utility of data lineage information. You can then determine if youâll need to invest in a dedicated data lineage tool or if some combination of existing tools and systems will provide the needed functionality.\n\nWhile reviewing integration capabilities, you might request demonstrations and trials, assess levels of support from potential vendors, and conduct cost-benefit analyses as needed.Â\n\n4. Normalize (and standardize) comprehensive documentation\n\nMaintaining detailed and accurate records of data lineage should be the rule, not the exception. This documentation becomes crucial for understanding data flows and ensuring data quality throughout the lifecycle.Â\n\nDepending on the size of organizations, data teams may also need to be vigilant regarding whether this documentation remains standardized over time. This contributes to robust data governance, guiding consistent understanding and use across departments and teamsâreducing confusion while fostering solid communication.\n\n5. Establish robust security and access control\n\nSecurity has always been critical for protecting sensitive lineage information. But itâs increasingly critical to position data security as the responsibility of everyone, not just those in IT. To this, implement secure communications and help your co-workers understand why, at their most basic level, encryption and secure APIs are being used.\n\nEstablish a consistent cadence and maintain detailed access logs to make sure systems and tools are patched and updated regularly. Implement monitoring tools to automatically detect unusual access patterns and ensure the right alerts get sent to the right people at the right times. And, as more of the organization leans in to keep data secure, robust access controls become increasingly important. Consider utilizing security principles like the principle of least privilege as you define and refine which roles and responsibilities get specific data access.Â\n\n6. Take time to make time for stakeholder buy-in\n\nAt this point, youâre more or less ready to approach stakeholders for their support. Make sure you do, and that a tacit buy-in is what you actually walk away with.\n\nDepending on your stakeholders, it may help to engage with them early and often. Make sure you clearly outline and identify the benefits the organizationâs data lineage practices will have. Demonstrate how the lineage practices align with the business and set realistic expectations, the latter of which can often be aided through a strategic series of pilot programs.\n\n7. Visualize lineage and support ongoing training\n\nYou probably visualized parts of your lineage proposal to help sell it. Carry the visualization forward, representing data lineage in ways that make it easy for employees with different experience levels, skill sets, and backgrounds to understand and digest.\n\nAs able, promote training that ensures different users understand how to leverage the tool or tools used to map data lineage. (Note: To promote this training, consider pizza.)\n\n8. Monitor and measure mapping effectiveness\n\nSystematic measurement requires systematic monitoring of how effective data lineage practices are over time. In turn, effectively doing both helps data teams ensure that supporting systems are robust, responsive, and stay aligned with organization governance and management objectives.\n\nIdeally, this monitoring and measurement isnât limited to lineage alone but functions as part of broader data management efforts.\n\n9. Review and update lineage practices regularly\n\nThe tail of the best-practices snake here consists of regular audits and reviews of the data lineage process as it unravels.Â\n\nThis is vital, as it allows data teams to adjust the granularity of data lineage mapping, balancing utility across users and uses while optimizing for evolving stakeholder needs.Â\n\nA data catalog can also be beneficial here. When embedded with data lineage information, these catalogs make it easier for users to get at and understand the data they need, enhancing overall data management.Â\n\nRemember that in data lineage, âwell-begunâ is half-done\n\nThe potential impact of a map directly correlates to the quality of information used to create it.Â\n\nBest practices, in addition to a clear understanding of the concept, certainly make data lineage practices more efficient and effective. But shifting the emphasis and expectation of data quality further left can make them exceptional.Â\n\nBe among the first to find out the role data contracts can (and increasingly do) play in the lineage of data by signing up for our product waitlist at Gable.ai.\n\nâ",
      "# [Data Governance: What Is It and What Are the Best Practices?](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-governance)\nRegarding data, knowing how, who, and what are the most critical questions to govern it efficiently and responsibly. Data governance gives organizations the strategy to manage their information.\n\nIn this article, weâll define data governance. Then, weâll dive into why itâs essential, critical pillars of governance, its benefits, and its challenges. By the end, youâll learn about one of the most innovative ways to govern your data assets: combining the common reactive approach with a more efficient, preventative strategy.Â\n\nWhat is data governance?\n\nData governance sets clear rules for handling and stewarding customer information throughout its lifecycle. It ensures data is accurate, used correctly, and kept safe.\n\nOne great way to imagine a data governance program is by picturing the following scenario:\n\nSuppose you buy an RV from an estate sale. It works great and looks terrific, but the seller says you get the whole package. Everything inside from the previous owners is yours. There might be something valuable in there, but you wonât know until you look around and sift through the items (and clutter) in the vehicle.\n\nThese objects, like pieces of data, have to be organized into a few categories:\n\nDetection: You discover and identify whatâs in the RV. There might be old vinyl records in a cubby, family photographs in the closet, or valuable jewelry left behind. Some things might be useful, others worthless, while different pieces might have significance in the future (for example, maybe you donât need the power drill you found in an old toolbox, but you might need it when you want to make minor improvements in the future).Â\n\nClassification: Now, itâs time to classify each item and formalize what youâve found. Label the value and use of each item. Organize everything so you can easily access it when itâs time to move them to the right place.\n\nProcess: Decide the policy youâll base decisions on, like how you plan on using the items. What determines a good object or not? Where should it go? Create a strategy to follow.\n\nParameters: Now that you have the process on paper, you can follow specific guidelines to determine what to do with each pieceâa set of clear rules.\n\nCommunication: Through documentation with metadata management, you can add the vital information you need to retrieve and understand it. In the context of the RV, it might look like labels, a notebook explaining everything, or another system entirely. This data catalog also articulates to others what they should do with the itemsâthereâs clear data lineage.\n\nLike the RV example, those governing data start with a central location. From there, they must decide what to do with the data, and who it should go to.\n\nFor example, different teams within an organization require different data sets, instructions on how to use them, and permissions for data access. Marketing teams, accounts receivable, customer service teams, and tech/product support would look different in the data governance contextâespecially as it may include social security numbers and sensitive data.\n\nThe data team can enact the process for governance that would create a way to protect everyone, provide accurate information at the right time, and provide clear guidelines on how to use it.\n\nWhy is it important?\n\nGood data governance has become essential now more than ever. Thanks to innovative technology (like artificial intelligence and machine learning) and customers living more of their lives online, there is a significant amount of information to collect, analyze, and use for decision-making and improving customer experiences.Â\n\nCustomers also expect you to use data efficiently, with McKinsey & Company reporting that 71% of consumers want personalized interactions and 76% get frustrated when companies fall short of it.\n\nThe importance of data governance initiatives is two-fold:\n\n1. Accurate, responsible, and efficient data for companies\n\nWith an effective data governance strategy, organizations can ensure high-quality data, use it responsibly, and maximize output.Â\n\nCompanies should ensure they have the right compliance, procedures, and tools to get the most out of data and use it to improve the customer experience.\n\nOne significant challenge is dealing with reactive strategies. While a quick response is ideal when something goes wrong with your data collection and processing, itâs not enough to ensure quality data governance. Companies need a preventative solution.\n\nGable's innovative technology helps organizations improve data quality at scale by fostering communication between data producers and consumers via data contracts. These contracts eliminate the human error component and stop mistakes before they happen.Â\n\n2. Ensuring customer trust in todayâs climate\n\nThe data industry knows the challenges itâs faced with privacy, transparency, and consumer trustâin short, the world is paying attention to how companies handle data.Â\n\nCompanies should be able to uphold regulations like GDPR and perform above standards to remove themselves from avoidable pitfalls. They can position themselves as one of the industry's safest, most trustworthy businesses.\n\nSince 2019, data privacy search inquiries have doubled, signaling the need for more responsible data management. Itâs no longer enough to handle data ethically, but consumers want full transparency and clarity on whatâs collected and how itâs used.\n\nSource: Google Trends | Search inquiries for data privacy have doubled in only a few years.\n\nEffective data governance addresses these concerns. Companies can use the tools necessary to handle big data responsibly and enable access to the right individuals. Organizations can also provide clear and transparent policies to customers, communicating data practices and what to expect.Â\n\nAs mentioned, customers want personalized experiences. This starts with quality data. And if we can combine that with the qualifications expected from us when it comes to building trustâlike data protection and transparencyâthen we can create a productive data strategy.\n\nWhen we fail to govern data\n\nWhen we can no longer trust data, it becomes unreliable. We no longer have a picture of consumers, the world, and where the market is heading. Management is stuck making business decisions no longer based on information but on best guesses.\n\nBut that doesnât have to be the case. By following foundational principles, we can avoid situations that compromise our data.Â\n\nData governance in the cloud era\n\nIn recent years, cloud technology has changed the data governance landscape. Depending on the infrastructure you use, data is available anywhere and everywhere. This has brought more concerns about safety, security, and management protocols.Â\n\nThe changes have led to more federated data governance. Unlike previous systems that centralized data, federated governance addresses the distributed nature of data in the cloud. It enables companies to manage and govern across different teams and platforms, providing flexibility, scalability, and efficiency regarding governance policies.Â\n\nAnother issue to consider is the involvement of non-technical teams in data governance. Non-technical staff will inevitably influence how data is managed as it becomes more accessible. Without the right system, code vulnerabilities can spark major concern.Â\n\nThatâs why a user-friendly no-code solution that allows users to manage data can help safeguard and empower non-technical teams to govern effectively. Clear guidelines that help govern data will also accelerate your governance strategy for better and safer results.Â\n\nThese fast-paced changes in modern cloud data governance require agile and adaptive systems. Unlike traditional governance, which might move slowly, contemporary governance must work quickly to adapt to changing tech and consumer expectations. Companies can adopt automated governance tools, implement continuous monitoring, and have a tighter feedback loop to adjust swiftly and respond to evolving requirements.\n\nThe four pillars of the data governance frameworkÂ\n\nData governance comprises a few foundational principles, often summarized in four pillars. As a data governance team works towards efficient and secure information, they have the job of ensuring that data is organized and ready for an organization to grow and achieve its top-level priorities.Â\n\n1. Upholding standards and regulationsÂ\n\nTeams must ensure that all practices, regulatory requirements, and compliances are maintained and upheld.Â\n\nFor example, the GDPR, or the General Data Protection Regulation, is one of the strictest laws globally for data security and privacy. The EU law ensures that consumers are protected and that there is transparency on what data is being collected and what itâs being used for.Â\n\nWhen companies become GDPR compliant, they meet EU standards and build one of the strongest, safest foundations for their data governance journey.Â\n\nGDPR and other relevant compliances and regulations are essential to ensuring companies meet legal standards. Afterward, they can continue to create an above-and-beyond approach to create a safer and more transparent system for consumers. As trends and privacy expectations evolve, businesses can lead the way.\n\n2. Data quality\n\nTeams are then expected to supervise data and ensure it is authentic and reliable. Data is only as good as its quality, and companies need it to make the right decisions. Quality can be measured by preciseness, thoroughness, authenticity, timeliness, and consistency.Â Â\n\nPreciseness: Is the data correct? Can it be validated and trusted?\n\nThoroughness: Is the data complete, and does it make sense as it is? Can it be used? Is there missing information that prevents the data from telling a complete story? Is the data organized?\n\nAuthenticity: Does each piece of information accurately represent the subject or action?\n\nTimeliness: Is this data relevant to understanding present situations? Does older information add context, or is it misleading? Using this data, can we predict growing trends?\n\nConsistency: Are we gathering enough data through regular intervals, touchpoints, and actions? Are all tools in sync and integrated? Is manual labor getting in the way of collection, metrics, and analytics?\n\n3. Transparency and privacyÂ\n\nData should be ethically managedâevery involved party should know whatâs collected, as well as how and what itâs used for. Managers should also make sure that these guidelines and promises are upheld.\n\n4. Data management\n\nManagement refers to the overall components of governanceâthe âgoverningâ portion. While stewardship identifies who is accountable and shapes the program, data management refers to all the moving pieces of making governing possibleâlike how efficient, secure, and cost-effective the process is. Additionally, it includes what tools are being used and how the data is stored.\n\nData governance key roles\n\nWhile there are many roles and responsibilities within data governance (like strategic level oversight), there are a few hands-on positions.\n\nSteward: The data steward cares for the data to ensure itâs accurate and up to policy standards.\n\nManager: The data manager helps put the strategic plan into action.\n\nUser: Data users involve the team and how they perform daily tasks, interact with the data, and study sets.Â\n\nWhat are the challenges of maintaining data governance?\n\nEach pillar of data governance faces obstacles.Â\n\nIs it accurate and timely? Data teams must optimize and review how they collect and analyze data consistently. Additionally, they need parameters to evaluate expired data. If the data is no longer accurate, the team loses trust in the information, leadership makes the wrong decisions, and the organization builds data debt.\n\nIs it going to the right people, and are they using the data as they should? Data teams must decide who has access to the data, how much of it, and what they can use it for. If there are inconsistencies in the policy or if circumstances change and leadership does not follow up, companies risk irresponsible governance and vulnerabilities.\n\nWhat happens when there is an inefficiency? How is it handled? If data tools are not working right, if data isnât organized, or if something is throwing a wrench into collection and analysis, teams need to quickly identify and solve the issue.\n\nIs the organization communicating its data policy? Teams must ensure that what data they collect and how they use it is communicated to customers, employees, and essential stakeholders. There should be transparency as data policies evolve.Â\n\n5 best practices to consider when managing data governance\n\n1. Choose the right team\n\nGovernance is about the right people. You need team members who are passionate about quality data and have the never-ending desire to ensure the best and most accurate information possible. Additionally, that information serves the organization and its initiatives.Â\n\n2. Understand itâs a process\n\nData governance is a lot like gardening. You donât plant seedlings and then revisit them in a few months. Most of them would die. Instead, you visit, water, and care for them often. When you spot weeds, you pull them out. Data governance is a continuous process that should be treated with care and dedication.Â\n\n3. Set high standards and communicate expectations\n\nEnsure your team is consistently communicating. They should question how enterprise data is collected, presented, and analyzed. Team members should be able to correct issues quickly and prevent the same ones in the future.\n\n4. Know the vision\n\nThe strategy should be crystal clear. If data teams know what the business goals are, they can manage data so that itâs organized and efficient to use for the needs of the organization. If team members arenât sure what the vision is, it creates confusion, messy data, and more difficulty in making strategic decisions.\n\n5. Invest in the right technology and data governance tools\n\nIn the data world, inefficient technology and human error can wreak havoc. Thatâs why choosing the right platforms and tools to help govern your data through contracts, automation, and communication is critical for creating a smooth process, reducing issues, and providing the best, most relevant information possible.\n\nGable: From reactive to preventative solutions\n\nReactive problem-solving is important. We need to be able to identify an issue and fix it to preserve data integrity and security. But it shouldnât be the only solution.Â\n\nMany reactive situations can be avoided from the start.Â\n\nGableâs proprietary technology provides data teams with data contracts to eliminate human error and prevent issues. Instead of waiting to identify a problem once itâs already happening (and causing damage), you can stop it from happening altogether.\n\nGableâs data contracts enable you to establish data owners, set requirements for the data, and codify these nuances as version-controlled code.\n\nWe know reactive data monitoring isnât enough. Gable ensures that alerts trigger from notifications within the CI/CD workflow. Our bot provides context to developers where they are and tags data consumers after detecting breaking changes.\n\nBy bridging the communication gap between data producers and consumers, our platform creates a more accurate, efficient solution for data.Â",
      "# [Data Consumers: How to Make a Meal Of Your Data](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-consumers)\nData consumers donât bite. Honest.Â\n\nBut they do play increasingly vital roles in modern businesses. And their ability to deliver on behalf of the organization does depend on you keeping them well-fedâwith data, that is.\n\n(Cue record-scratch.)\n\nâ\n\nData consumers are individuals, systems, and applications that access and use data to perform specific tasks or make informed decisions. As data continues to proliferate into more aspects of daily life, this definition becomes increasingly important.Â\n\nWhile most of us consume data by default, technical data consumersâthose working in data analytics, data science, business intelligence, and the likeârely as much on the quality of data as they do its availability. This necessitates treating data as a product, with the entire organization working together to ensure the highest standards of quality are maintained over the course of the data lifecycle.Â Â\n\nThis is why itâs imperative for those working in tech-adjacent roles (e.g., managers, executives, decision-makers, and stakeholders) to understand how they can optimize for data consumers within their own organizations. But weâll circle back to that.\n\nFirst, letâs lay a foundation by making sure we clarify what separates data producers from data consumers (and what doesnât) in addition to covering who commonly acts as a data consumer in modern businesses.\n\nData producers vs. data consumers: As simple as it seems?\n\nIt does seem obvious. Data producers produce and/or provide data, while data consumers access and use that data. However, there are nuances to this relationship that are worth understanding. Here are some key factors, common within business environments, that can challenge the seemingly clear distinction between data production and consumption.\n\nOverlapping functions\n\nWhile often considered separately, a single entity can function as both a data producer and consumer. For example, sales teams often produce data about customer interactions, which counts as a producer role. However, itâs common for these same teams to handle the analysis of this data in order to refine their sales strategies. More generally, feedback loops within a data-savvy organization have this effect as well.\n\nData transformation\n\nTransformation of data is an instrumental part of data management. In practice, data producers may act as sources of raw data. This data then undergoes a transformation process as itâs ingested into the organization for use downstream. This can blur the line between producers and consumers in practice, as the transformation process necessitates data being consumed from one source before being delivered for use to another.\n\nVariability of data production\n\nData is produced both actively and passively. An example of active production could be the filling out of a basic web form, a deliberate act of data entry, or data generation. This could be related to customer data or personal data when individuals provide information about themselves.\n\nAn example of passive data production is how user interactions are typically logged on a social media platform or a website. These data sources often involve data collection methods that track user behavior. Whether or not data is actively or passively produced can challenge the notion of whether itâs being produced or consumed by a given data system.\n\nData stewardship and ownership\n\nGranted, data producers generate data. However, they may not have stewardship or ownership over the data produced. At the same time, data stewards who may not produce or consume data directly often play a crucial tertiary role in ensuring data quality, privacy, and security.\n\nTiming and evolution\n\nProducers and consumers of data often interact with data at different times. Itâs common for data produced in real-time to be consumed in batches, or vice versa. This asynchronicity can also cloud a binary notion of whoâs producing and consuming data over time.Â\n\nAnd, over time, the needs of data evolve as business models evolve. Meaning systems traditionally viewed as data consumers, like home appliances, can become data producers (i.e., the Internet of Things).\n\nThe basic definitions of data producers and consumers are simple enough. But as business leaders, itâs advantageous to appreciate how fluid these definitions can be in practice.\n\nWho (and what) are data consumers?\n\nWith this valuable context in mind, letâs now touch on whoâand whatâtypically functions as a data consumer within an organization. This of course includes individuals and teams, but consumers can also be systems and applications or external entities.\n\nIndividuals and teams\n\nBusiness analysts and data scientists: Those who analyze data to extract insights, identify trends, and recommend business improvements certainly count as data consumers, as do the experts using advanced statistics, machine learning, and sheer compute to cull insights and predictions from data.\n\nSales and marketing teams: The aforementioned sales teams consume data to track sales performance, identify leads, and forecast sales trends. At the same time, marketing teams leverage data to better understand customer behavior, segment markets, measure campaign effectiveness, and, like their counterparts in sales, attempt to forecast trends.\n\nFinance, accounting, and operations teams: Key players on these teams consume data for budgeting, forecasting, financial reporting, and risk assessment analysis.\n\nOperations and supply chain teams: These teams consume data to optimize inventory and streamline operations.\n\nHuman resources (HR): Those working in human resources increasingly consume data related to recruitment trends (i.e., supply and demand), workforce analytics, and employee performance.\n\nCustomer support and service teams: High-performing contact centers rely on a constant stream of data to track service requests, evaluate customer feedback, and improve customer satisfaction.\n\nProduct managers: These roles require all available data to monitor product performance, user engagement, and identify areas of improvement.\n\nDecision makers and stakeholders: In data-driven organizations, senior leaders and managers rely on aggregated data and insights to make more productive, strategic decisions.\n\nSystems and applications\n\nBusiness intelligence tools: BI tools like Tableau, QlikView, and Power BI consume data in order to create visual representations and dashboards that analysts (also data consumers, see above) use in their work.\n\nCustomer relationship management systems: Alternatively, popular CRMs (think Salesforce and Hubspot) also consume data. Some do produce data visualizations as well, but this functionality is secondary to their primary goal of helping manage customer data and interactions.\n\nEnterprise resource planning systems: ERPs are comprehensive software solutions built to consume massive quantities of data in order to integrate various business processes and functions into a single system, one that aids in data management, process automation, reporting, analytics, and more.\n\nAutomated reporting systems: Complexity is not a prerequisite for being a data consumer, as straightforward reporting systems like NinjaOne and Alteryx consume data only as needed to aid in data preparation and report generation.\n\nData warehouses and data lakes: Typically thought of as data sources, centralized data repositories engineered to store structured and unstructured data must, by design, consume data in order to serve their purpose.\n\nMachine learning models: The algorithms driving artificial intelligence (AI) consume troves of data in order to make business-related predictions or automate decision-making processes.Â\n\nApplication programming interfaces: And, while APIs do not technically consume data to serve their purpose, they do get an honorable mention here since they create the pathways different systems and applications use to communicate, consume, and share data together.Â\n\nExternal entities\n\nPartners and affiliates: Business partners like suppliers, vendors, marketing agencies, and consulting firms often need to consume organizational data to measure joint campaign performance or align strategies.\n\nRegulatory bodies: In highly regulated industries like finance and healthcare, organizations may need to share data with regulatory authorities to ensure business operations and data management are in compliance.Â\n\nYour valued customers: Last but not least, digitally sophisticated customers are voracious when it comes to data consumption in the world of B2C. And, in B2B scenarios, customers are also increasingly consuming data reports and analytics as they grow both more available and accessible to less technical audiences.\n\n15 best practices to optimize your org for data consumers\n\nIn business, sadly, not all individuals get to enjoy the luxury of thinking about data management and information technology all day, every day. For those who cannot, all the information weâve shared at this point was provided to foster an understanding and appreciation for the nuanced and varied roles consumers play in the data lifecycle.\n\nBut, often, these are the same people who have the influence and pull needed to empower a truly data-driven organization. For this reason, the following list of 15 succinct best practices is curated for those stakeholders and decision-makers who want to help set the table, so to speak.\n\nLetâs dig in:\n\n1. Engage with your data consumers\n\nOne of the best things a stakeholder can do is simple: Regularly communicate with data users in the organization. Take the time to understand the distinct requirements and challenges they face in their role.\n\nPro tip: Make constant communication easy by scheduling regular, brief check-ins with those you consider to be key data users. Quick, consistent 15-minute meetings are far more useful than longer meetings set up and attended âonce in a while.â\n\n2. Treat your data as a product\n\nRestaurants live and die based on the quality of the ingredients they source. The needs and importance of your data consumers are just one of many reasons to make sure your data is of the highest possible quality, ensuring it is reliable, timely, and consistent.\n\nPro tip: The volume of data flow through even a relatively small organization is often more than can be managed manually. Work with your data leaders to implement automated data quality checks. Also, make sure that any alerts these systems use when they detect anomalies are set up to go to the right people, at the right time.\n\n3. Adopt a strong data governance framework\n\nâData governanceâ can sound intense. But at its heart, governance is really just a formalized approach to defining and maintaining clear roles for data ownership and stewardship.\n\nPro tip: Robust governance is a must in todayâs data-driven business world. Do your part by making sure the team or data stewards in charge are given the support and bandwidth required to succeed in their role (especially if one of those stewards will be you).\n\n4. Prioritize data security and compliance\n\nItâs a lot harder to deal with a burglar when theyâre already inside your house. Ensure that encryption, access controls, and regular audits are all in place to protect data on behalf of your consumers. Itâs important to ensure everyone is up to date with regularly updated data privacy regulations specific to your organization and business model.\n\nPro tip: In partnership with your data leaders, look to leverage cloud-based solutions that include built-in security features. Doing so reduces the burdens of managing security completely in-house.\n\n5. Provide accessible data tools\n\nChampion tools and platforms for your data consumers that have earned a reputation for being highly intuitive to use. Powerful solutions that are also user-friendly encourage wide adoption, enhanced productivity, reduced training costs, and increased data accuracy.\n\nPro tip: Donât sleep on the power of data visualization in business. BI tools in particular tend to offer dashboard capabilities that allow for quick insights without the deep dives.\n\n6. Educate and train staff\n\nData literacy should no longer be relegated to specific departments. Itâs not a choreâitâs a responsibility. The health and quality of data is determined by all of its consumers, both direct and indirect. Promote this mission-critical knowledge through regular training sessions and workshops, in addition to up-to-date, accessible resources.\n\nPro tip: On-demand online training modules can drastically simplify an ongoing data literacy initiative. They serve as a means to centralize information and resources, in addition to minimizing the need for lengthy (read: costly) training sessions.\n\n7. Design for scalability and adaptability\n\nHelp ensure data systems in your organization are built to scale with the needs of your business and your data consumers.\n\nPro tip: Explore how cloud solutions can also support your ability to scale with respect to data. As these solutions grow more ubiquitous, it becomes easier to find one that can grow in sync with your business, without the need for frequent upgrades.\n\n8. Encourage cross-functional collaboration\n\nOne data-related area that firmly falls within the onus of leadership is whether or not collaborative environments are actively fostered within the organization. Optimizing for data consumption requires departments proactively working to share data and insights, and minimize data silos.\n\nPro tip: Think of inter-office communication platforms like Slack or Teams as collaboration platforms. Encourage quick, specific chats as a way of keeping your data consumers out of lengthy meetings.\n\n9. Streamline data collection processes\n\nTo ensure efficiency and reduce redundancy, normalize the ongoing automation and optimization of data collection.\n\nPro tip: Automating everything isnât the goal. Look at where a little bit of automation will have the biggest impact. Sometimes, something as simple as utilizing APIs to pull data without manual intervention can net significant benefits.\n\n10. Iterate based on feedback\n\nThere should be no set-it-and-forget-it with organizational data management. Data processes need to be continuously refined based on the feedback you get from data consumers. More than just understanding their needs, you can play a vital role in keeping those needs met.\n\nPro tip: Business is complicated, but soliciting valuable feedback doesnât have to be. Look to use simple feedback tools or surveys. Think about how you can reduce barriers so feedback relating to data usage is easy to give and receive.\n\n11. Stay in the know regarding data innovations\n\nLike data literacy, many people within an organization should be investing time to review emerging data-related trends through the lens of their role, experience, and skill sets. The sparks that lead to early adoption can come from anywhere. And the competitive advantages of early adoption can often prove invaluable.\n\nPro tip: Subscribe to a few industry newsletters and data-related Substacks. Just as regularly reading the trades is a must in Hollywood, use a few moments of your morning to review whoâs doing what with data in your industry.\n\n12. Clarify data use cases\n\nUse cases are an excellent way to make sure specific scenarios or objectives your data consumers face align with the businessâs overall goals.\n\nPro tip: It never hurts to base consumer use cases on clear business objectives. Keeping a focus on goals enables you to help streamline data processes and reduce unnecessary work.\n\n13. Leverage external data resources\n\nConsider formal partnerships or collaborations with external data sources that can enhance and complement internal data. Market trends, demographic information, and industry benchmarks can often enrich internal sales data. Analyzing data from external sources can lead to new market opportunities, potential risks, and emerging trends. And external data can be used to benchmark organizational performance against industry standards, or the competition.\n\nPro tip: Outsourcing some data needs can save time and improve data quality. But always endeavor to partner with the most reputable and trustworthy data providers.\n\n14. Document your data processes\n\nDocumentation is a critical part of maintaining high data quality. Your organization should maintain an accessible repository of all data guidelines, standards, and workflows, ensuring consistency and clarity in data practices.\n\nPro tip: To keep documentation from becoming daunting, leverage documentation tools with simple yet robust templates. Over time, these templates reduce the effort needed to update and maintain your documentation.\n\n15. Conduct regular data audits\n\nData access, usage, and quality all need to be reviewed periodically. By making data audits consistent, youâll help identify areas of improvement while ensuring compliance.\n\nPro tip: Donât expect your peers to party when audit time rolls around. But do work to schedule audits during less busy periods in the business. This consideration, along with keeping up a regular cadence with the audits themselves, can prevent unexpected issues and reduce stress.\n\nOrganizations are brimming with data-hungry professionalsâmake sure the data you source is always up to code\n\nâ\n\nWeâre still a bit in the Wild West when it comes to managing data at scale, especially with the recent rise of large language models. However, there are valuable third parties that can lend a hand through the use of data contracts. Gable.ai is transforming how data contracts work, and the data consumers in your organization deserve to benefit from what weâre cooking up in our own kitchen.",

      "# [How to Protect the Data Pipeline Process with Data Contracts](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-pipeline-process)\nThe most efficient systems may be extremely valuable and essential, but everything goes out the window when there's a vulnerability.\n\nâ\n\nTake, for instance, air travel. Itâs the most efficient way to get you from Point A to Point B.\n\nâ\n\nThe passengers of Alaska Airlines wouldâve agreed too, when suddenly, on January 5th, 2024, a piece of the aircraft snapped off with a bang.\n\nâ\n\nThankfully, they made it back safely, and the aircrew acted heroically to ensure everyone was safe. But it brings up an important issue.\n\nâ\n\nLike an aircraft, your data pipeline process should be accurate and protected at all times. Thatâs why ensuring your pipeline is safeguarded from future vulnerabilities, breakages, and interruptions is critical.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nFirst, weâll define a data pipeline. Then, weâll go over some types you can expect, steps, and benefits for data pipelines.\n\nâ\n\nFinally, weâll learn how data contracts can help protect your data pipeline process for better accuracy and efficiency.\n\nWhat is a data pipeline?\n\nA data pipeline is how a company defines and executes how raw data moves between systems, gets verified, stored, and maintained.\n\nThe data pipeline process clarifies how we incorporate our data strategy.\n\nWhen the data is processed, it goes to the data sink for use case applications, a data warehouse for analytics, or the data lake for continued data science and machine learning.\n\nWhat types of data pipelines are there?\n\nData pipeline strategies vary based on your industry and needs. But the pipeline can be split into two types.\n\n1. Batch processing pipeline\n\nThe batch method is one of the more traditional options companies choose for enterprise data. Itâs when a company processes data through fixed, predefined parameters. Your team can process larger quantities of data at a time.\n\nSince such a big data load can cause latency issues, the information is often processed during odd hours with less user activity, such as at 3 a.m.\n\nBatch processing is effective for processing lots of data that arenât as time-sensitive. It can include historical data or metadata that could be useful in the future.\n\nBatch pipelines, however, are challenging to maintain, with systems often having to process data even if it hasnât changed (which is a lot of work for humans and computers). Since you load volumes of data, your system will also have a knowledge gap and contain outdated information.\n\n2. Real-time or streaming processing pipeline\n\nStreaming processing pipelines are a great way to manage your data in the fast-paced world of computers and the internet.\n\nA streaming pipeline is when companies process data as it arrives, giving them low latency and current insights. Data engineers and teams can work with new data and updated datasets through automation.\n\nUnlike batch data, stream processing is constantly changing. It influences your dashboards with metrics, data analytics, and decision-making information.\n\nWhile this pipeline is very effective, it can be risky if you donât have the right data strategy in place. You want to ensure you have the right tools and management to verify data quality and prevent hiccups as data is gathered and processed.\n\nPipelines can also include focused categories, depending on your type of business and where your data flow is. Some examples include:\n\nCloud data process: The focus on cloud-based services and how data lives, processes, and is integrated within the cloud.\n\nMachine learning process: How data is processed for machine learning (the end-to-end deployment of learning models and data preparation).\n\nData governance process: How data is governed and protected for quality, security, and compliance.\n\nWhat is ELT and ETL?\n\nAs you improve your data pipeline process, you may come across the terms ELT and ETL. They sound the same, and for the most part they are.\n\nBoth of these models focus on the order of steps for pipelines.\n\nThe initials stand for the same but place emphasis on the order:\n\nE = Extract\n\nL = Load\n\nT = Transform\n\nThey cover how data is collected, changed, and stored. These days, different pipelines can have multiple stages where ELT and ETL are involved. Often, the methods are talked about interchangeably and already function within your pipeline.\n\nELT (extract, load, and transform) might be good for a SaaS with strict rules and a critical schema to follow.\n\nOn the other hand, ETL (extract, transform, load) might be a good option to store information in your data warehouse or lake.\n\nWhat is the difference between an ETL/ELT and data pipeline?\n\nETL and ELT fall under the umbrella of your data pipeline and how you process information. While two different things, the ETL and ELT refer to your tactical steps while the pipeline encompasses the process.\n\nWhat are the benefits of a data pipeline process?\n\nData pipelines create a better way to manage your data and save you time. Below are the top advantages of a healthy process:\n\n1. Get better data quality\n\nWhen you implement a data pipeline process, you get cleaner results. The pipeline can refine the information, find and correct redundancies, and provide a usable dataset to work with.\n\n2. Make it a more efficient process\n\nData pipelines, thanks to data contracts, make it possible to automate the process. This saves thousands of hours of data engineering work. Instead, your team can use the saved time to find ways to improve your data approach or analyze the information.\n\n3. Implement a holistic approach to data\n\nThrough automation and the ability to bring your data together, your pipeline can integrate your data sources, transform data, and create a holistic product. It checks values from different sources and finds consistency errors. Additionally, it flags and corrects other common errors.\n\nWhat are the steps of the data pipeline process?\n\nETL and ELT are part of the data pipeline infrastructure. The concepts are also commonly summarized into the following:\n\n1. Data ingestion\n\nThis is when data is extracted from sources and brought to a central location for company access and analyses.\n\nThe data is often found from a source like a CRM (Salesforce, Hubspot, or Zoho). It can also come from other sources that collect data.\n\n2. Data transformation\n\nData is converted and structured to fit your system as a usable format.\n\nTransformation can take many forms. It may be the way you need data recognized, filtered, or segmented. Company pipelines may include data contracts to automatically sort and manipulate the data.\n\nâ3. Data storage\n\nFinally, your data is stored so that the company can access it and use it for business operations.\n\nIt usually arrives at a data warehouse or data lake. From there, your data team can analyze the information or use it.\n\nWhat are the benefits of Apache Kafka?\n\nApache Kafka is a popular solution for data pipeline processing. It is an open-source platform that helps manage and transform your real-time dataâwhich is great for streaming pipelines.\n\nThere are plenty of benefits to using Apache Kafka.\n\nItâs open-sourced, which means you can build your own solutions or partner with a third party to create a custom fit for your company.\n\nItâs fast and scalable, so you can process data immediately across many servers.\n\nItâs durable with Apache Kafkaâs ability to provide intra-cluster replication.\n\nIt has high performance, even when dealing with large amounts of data.\n\nHow do data contracts support pipelines?\n\nData is only as good as its accuracy. The minute itâs compromised, you canât trust it. Your business decisions, customer behavior analytics, and planning are now done in the dark.\n\nThankfully, we now have the technology to prevent data pipeline issues before they happen.\n\nYou no longer have to worry about a problem after that fact, you can rely on data contracts to execute smooth processes and eliminate avoidable mistakes.\n\nData contracts define the structure, format, and criteria for data as it is extracted, transformed, and stored. It eliminates human error and can find issues before they become a problem.\n\nData contracts automate your pipeline for a smoother, more accurate data process and workflow.\n\nData contracts for a better pipeline process\n\nWhen you think of a literal pipeline that moves water, itâs a powerful force. Itâs efficient, it moves fast, and it can push the resource to its destination.\n\nWhere pipelines might depend on water pressure, gravity, and energy to function properly, your data pipeline needs its power source too.\n\nData contracts move, transform, and store your information efficiently through automatic processes. Choosing the right solution provides the power source to make it possible.\n\nGable automatically generates contract templates, manages contract versioning, and enforces contracts using a variety of alerting thresholds.\n\nYou can collaborate with data engineers, data scientists, and software engineers to create and modify contracts over time.\n\nWith Gable, you can prevent breaking changes programmatically and alert consumers when contract updates will impact them. You can manage contract versions and evolution simply and easily.\n\nItâs perfect for your data pipeline process, especially if you want to take control of your data management and use your information to its full potentialâso you can grow your company with secure, reliable, and efficient data.",
      "# [OLTP Vs. OLAP: How Professional POVs Cause Data Problems](https://www.gable.ai/blog/oltp-vs-olap)\nIn the world of blog writing, âx vs. yâ is a common theme. Contrasting two concepts, products, or services provides several cognitive advantages. Comparisons highlight both unique characteristics and shared features. Understanding the relationship between two items requires critical thinking and analysis. We also tend to learn better when information is presented in context, as opposed to abstraction.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nHowever, OLTP (online transaction processing) vs. OLAP (online analytical processing) is a special case in the data space. Because OLTP and OLAP are, quite frequently, at odds with each other. Writing for the Data Products Substack, Gable.aiâs Mark Freeman shares his first-hand account of the problematic ways OLTP and OLAP can shape the âdata worldviewâ of their users:\n\nIn my last role as a data scientist, I was hired at an HR tech company specifically to translate between the engineering and research teams, essentially turning analytics and I/O psychology theory into data products.\n\nDespite both teams having the same ultimate goal of building amazing HR data products, I experienced firsthand the breakdown of communication and misunderstanding of needs amongst these two groups through this translation work. Upon talking to others in the data industry I quickly learned that this challenge wasnât unique to my job, but rather an endemic issue across data teams of various company sizes.\n\nFortunately, Markâs experiences have also led him to some thoughts on how OLTP and OLAP practitioners can bridge the âversusâ gap in their actual working environments. But first, letâs cover what these two forms of data processing are, the roles they play, and where the complications arise.\n\nOLTP and OLAP data processing\n\nIn the context of the data space OLTP and OLAP are two fundamental concepts that serve different but complementary purposes, both in managing and utilizing data within organizations.\n\nOLTP at a glance\n\nBasic role\n\nOLTP systems are designed to manage transaction-oriented applications. As such, they are optimized to handle large numbers of short atomic (i.e., indivisible), and often simple operations.\n\nPrimarily, these operations are involved in many day-to-day transactions that help a business operate like order entry, retail sales, financial transactions, and customer relationship interactions.\n\nKey characteristics\n\nOperationally focused, directly involved in business operations\n\nHigh throughput for short operations like create, read, update, and delete (CRUD)\n\nEnsures data integrity in real-time\n\nDeal with current data that is highly detailed\n\nUse case examples\n\nBanking systems\n\nOnline booking systems\n\nRetail point of sale (POS) systems\n\nOLAP at a glance\n\nBasic role\n\nOLAP systems are designed for query-intensive and complex analytical calculations. These systems are optimized for data analysis and geared toward querying large sets of data at once to aid in looking for patterns, trends, and insights.\n\nThe primary role of OLAP is to aid in decision-making processes, like data mining, business intelligence (BI), and trend analysis.\n\nKey characteristics\n\nAnalytically focused, used to drive strategic business decisions\n\nVery efficient in handling complex queries that involve aggregations and joining large datasets\n\nWhen used, data is often consolidated from various OLTP databases and other sources\n\nInvolves historical data analysis, as OLAP systems allow users to work on large volumes of historical data to derive insights over time\n\nUse case examples\n\nFinancial reporting, customer relationship management (CRM) analytics, data warehousing systems\n\nHow OLTP and OLAP work together\n\nIn integrated data warehousing environments, OLTP and OLAP will often share a data source-destination relationship. OLTP systems collect data through daily business operations and then pass it to OLAP systems for analysis. As part of this process, OLTP systems typically use an Entity-Relationship (ER) model, optimized for transactional efficiency. OLAP systems, alternately, will use a star schema or snowflake schema more optimized for reading and analyzing data.\n\nThis congruent relation is important to highlight, as OLTP and OLAP, despite their differences, function as complementary systems. Due to OLTPâs focus on efficient transaction processing and OLAPâs on complex data analysis, both are often necessary for a comprehensive data strategy that is two parts of a whole.\n\nAppreciation of this interplay between OLTP and OLAP is important, as it lays a foundation for helping us appreciate how these complementary systems foster such a surprising amount of discord amongst data professionals.\n\nUnpacking the âvs.â in OLTP vs. OLAP\n\nAs Mark witnessed firsthand, the tension between OLTP data producers and OLAP data consumers stems from how these two groups approach the handling and interpretation of data. While related challenges will be unique to each organization, here are seven factors that consistently contribute to the OLTP/OLAP communication gap:\n\n1. Separate objectives and priorities\n\nAs the data producers in this equation, OLTP systems are employed in an organization to manage and process transactional data. Use cases like updating inventory and managing customer information requires immediate, real-time data. This necessitates that OLTP users prioritize operational efficiency, preserving data integrity, and sheer speed.\n\nOLAP system users, as data consumers, have very different priorities. They are looking to cast a slow, thorough gaze across large amounts of historical data in an attempt to identify trends that can improve strategic decision-making. This requires a combination of data aggregation, complex queries, and measured data analysis in order to extract insights and support long-term planning.\n\n2. Different data structures and models\n\nOLTP data producers use a normalized data model in order to reduce data redundancy and maintain data integrity. Normalized data models are also easy to organize and update, in addition to being very consistent.\n\nHowever, while these factors benefit transactional processes, normalized data models are inefficient when used for complex queries, requiring data from multiple tables. This is exactly what data analysis requires, which is why OLAP data systems frequently utilize a denormalized data model. These models organize data into large comprehensive models that facilitate querying which can be both quick and complex, by comparison.\n\n3. Misaligned interpretations of data\n\nHolding very distinct objectives, producers and users may understandably interpret the same data in very different ways. Again, producers are looking for the quickest and most efficient ways to record and retrieve transactional data so that it remains highly in sync with the real-world operations of a business. But for the consumers, working to identify trends through moment-to-moment changes would be like studying individual grains of sand to track the ebb and flow of an entire coastline.\n\n4. Distinct languages\n\nOLTP and OLAP users quite literally end up speaking very different languages.\n\nOLTP users typically leverage more technical, operational language in their work. Terms and concepts in the world of real-time transactional processes involve database management, application performance, and transactional integrity. Water-cooler discussion might center on resolving issues related to query speed, system reliability, and database normalization.\n\nMeanwhile, in the world of the OLAP user, language will be much more business and analytically focused, including business intelligence (BI) terminology, statistical analysis, and data visualization concepts. Around this respective water cooler, practitioners might instead discuss data warehousing, business metrics, dimensional modeling, and big data analytics.\n\n5. Data quality and transformation issues\n\nAs data moves from an OLTP to an OLAP system, issues can arise regarding data quality and transformation. Attempts to resolve these issues through denormalization or integration from additional sources can result in misalignments concerning data accuracy, timeliness, and completeness.\n\n6. Complexity in business logic\n\nThe business logic used to great effect in OLTP environments may not translate cleanly into an OLAP system.\n\nFor example, in a sales environment, every time a customer makes a purchase, inventory needs to be updated, sales details need to be captured, and loyalty or rewards points might even need to be talliedâall of which an OLTP system would log behind the scenes. Business logic in this example would involve immediate updates to ensure inventory accuracy, recording of sales details, and updates to customer profiles. Stock quantities need to be decremented and loyalty points incremented.\n\nDownstream, however, OLAP users are working to analyze sales data over time to help stakeholders make strategic decisions, like understanding the seasonality of customer buying patterns and predicting future inventory needs. This changes the business logic. Here, the focus is not on individual transactions and instead is on aggregating the sales data over time. Users and their systems might look to calculate average sale values per customer, or to review years of historical sales data to improve their ability to forecast future stock requirements.\n\nNo surprise then, that in our example business logic from the former would not seamlessly transfer to the latter. While still complementary, disparate logic would need to be corrected each time a data transfer is made, resulting in the aforementioned discrepancies with how the data needs to be understood and used.\n\n7. Different performance metrics\n\nFinally, both professional camps would be equally concerned with measuring success. But while OLTPs would be judged based on metrics like transaction throughput and response time, OLAPs would instead like to be indicators of data freshness and query response time. Even when all involved in a given organization understand the metrics used by the other party, thereâs no reason to believe theyâll inherently value them accordingly.\n\nHow then to bridge the OLTP vs. OLAP gap?\n\nNot only is the OLTP vs. OLAP issue interesting to consider, but overcoming it may prove instructive, as more âversusâ situations may be ahead, with more organizations using more data more of the time. But Markâs own experiences lead us to a conclusion we can build on:\n\n...the solution to this divide between OLTP and OLAP database users is not to force the benefits of one side or the other but to instead foster empathy so that both sides can translate the needs of each other...we made great strides by including the data consumers in the product requirements document (PRD) writing phase. It worked well because we added the OLAP perspective before data producers were constrained by existing requirements to deliver a product on a tight deadline. For the data consumers, we finally had an opportunity to see upstream and learn the product constraints that impacted our business logic.\n\nBut, as Mark notes, any solution that bridges this gap needs to scale in order to be effective. Because when they donât, teams drift back into their comfort zones, perpetuating the OLAT vs. OLAP issues.\n\nUltimately, this led Mark to realize data contracts are the ideal avenue through which to scale and maintain empathy between OLTP and OLAP usersâcreating ecosystems where data sharing and analysis are not only more efficient but also more aligned with the needs and expectations of all parties involved. Â\n\nMoreover, it also led Mark to Gable.ai, where heâs now part of our passionate team, working to transform how data producers and consumers work together.",
      "# [5 Dang Good Data Lineage Tools: Pros, Cons, and Pricing](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-lineage-tools)\nThe good news is that business leaders and stakeholders are increasingly seeing the value of data lineage in their organizations. The even better news is that the data lineage tool market offers more options for data teams every year.Â\n\nAs a whole, the global data catalog market is projected to grow from $878.8 million in 2023 to $4,680.9 million by 2032, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.7% during this period.

      "# [Automated Data Governance: The Science of Better Compliance](https://www.gable.ai/blog/automated-data-governance)\nThe increased adoption of AI and machine learning is getting a lot of press latelyâfor good reason. But, in total, there are quite a few other factors driving organizations to automate their data governance processes.\n\nThe shift toward cloud-based data solutions necessitates robust data governance frameworks to manage data across diverse environments. And the need for real-time data governance exponentially grows as organizations seek to respond immediately to changes in data.\n\nEnsuring high data quality is also increasingly essential for organizations to get the reliable analytics and decision-making they need to remain competitive. But as these data needs grow both in scale and complexity, the ability for organizations to track data lineage and metadata management with a high degree of fidelity grows more critical as well.\n\nTo add to these issues, we have the growing movements of data democratization and data as a productâto which the benefits of automated data governance are crucial, too.\n\nTherefore, the need for automated governance processes has certainly arrived. So why are some data professionals still relying on manual data governance practices? Well, as it turns out, there are actually some very good reasons.\n\nWeâll explore whatâs holding some teams back and look at how data contracts might offer a way forward for most. But first, weâll break down the advantages automated data governance promises most organizations.Â\n\nBenefits of automated data governance\n\nLet's explore the common benefits of automated data governance, from internal flow to tangible savings and advantages.\n\nContinuous monitoring and compliance\n\nAutomated systems continuously monitor data handling practices. In doing so, they ensure compliance with important regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) around the clock.\n\nMoreover, automated data governance tools create detailed logs and audit trailsâfacilitating more reliable and, frankly, easier audits.\n\nIncreased efficiency and cost savings\n\nWhen data leaders automate routine governance tasks, it frees up team-member bandwidth, allowing data professionals to focus on higher-value, more strategic opportunities.\n\nIn addition to this resource optimization, governance automation further streamlines the data management process, lowering operational costs.\n\nFaster decision-making\n\nAutomated governance systems provide real-time data quality checks and governance metrics. Together, this information enables faster and more informed decision-making.\n\nAdditionally, these automated processes are designed for growthâscaling easily as the data needs of an organization ebb and flow.\n\nEnhanced data security\n\nAutomated data governance also helps data teams manage personnel scaling, enforce strict access controls, and monitor data access patterns.\n\nThis reduces the risk of unauthorized access, which can be especially challenging in large organizations. Automated governance helps teams detect data breaches and governance policy violations faster, enabling them to mitigate potential damages.\n\nSupport for advanced analytics and AI\n\nAs mentioned above, high-quality, well-governed data is mission-critical for advanced analytics and AI initiatives (and the essential insights they increasingly provide).\n\nAn emerging concern is also ensuring that organizations' use of AI remains compliant with ethical standards and regulations. By automating data governance processes, organizational leadership gains the assurance that they're supporting responsible AI development.\n\nCompetitive advantages\n\nFinally, gaining and maintaining a competitive advantage is always a priority for organizations. However, doing so increasingly requires the fidelity of reliable, well-governed data that manual data governance can struggle to provide.\n\nData governance automation helps organizations build trust with customers, who need to be increasingly assured their data is handled with professional consideration and care.\n\nWhy some data pros haven't gone all-in on automating their governance processes (and how data contracts can help)\n\nSo, in the face of this comprehensive collection of potential benefits, why havenât all data professionals embraced automating their organizationâs data governance?\n\nWell, like many practical aspects of data engineering, it can be complicated. There are some very valid issues that engineering teams need to tackle as part of automating their data governance processes. Weâll tough on the seven that are most consequential.Â\n\nTo be clear (because weâre certainly a bit biased), data contracts are not a panaceaâsolving each and every challenge related to embracing automated data governance. However, as youâll see, a well-drafted data contract can turn seemingly prohibitive mountains into intrinsically manageable molehills.\n\n1. Cost concerns\n\nTo be fair, implementing automated data governance solutions tends to require at least some upfront investments in new software, infrastructure, and potentially new hardware.\n\nWith these initial investments come additional needs for maintenance, updates, and costs associated with the integration and scaling of automated systems.\n\nHow a data contract can help:\n\nDrafting a data contract involves clearly defining data expectations and interfaces. This streamlines the organizational integration process as a wholeâwhich, by extension, can reduce the complexities and costs required to establish automated data governance.\n\nWell-defined data contracts also enable data governance processes to scale. As a result, extensive manual adjustments are then no longer required to adapt governance processes to a growing data environment, further lowering costs.Â\n\n2. Complexity and integration challenges\n\nItâs also common for organizations to have already invested in legacy systems, which may not easily integrate with newer automated governance tools. To be very fair, the complexities of integrating various data sources and systems to enable data governance automation can be a major undertaking.\n\nAs part of these challenges, automated solutions might require extensive customization to fit the specific needs of a given organization, potentially consuming time and being complicated in their own regard.\n\nHow a data contract can help:\n\nThe clarity data contract drafting brings to data quality definitions and expectations facilitates easier integration with existing systems. Once in place, they also promote standardization across data sources and systems, making it easier for teams to integrate and manage data from diverse origins.\n\nTeams can further simplify the integration process by implementing data contracts in a modular fashion, starting with critical data flows and gradually expanding.\n\n3. Lack of expertise and resources\n\nIt takes specialized skills in data management, data science, and IT to implement and manage automated data governance effectively. Not all organizations have that specialized expertise in-house.\n\nAlternatively, organizations (smaller organizations in particular) may lack the resources to dedicate to a substantial overhaul of their data governance processes.\n\nHow a data contract can help:\n\nOne of the many inherently democratizing aspects of data contracts is how they encapsulate complex governance rules and requirements into manageable components. Doing so makes it easier for teams with limited expertise to implement and maintain organizational data.\n\nAs for the implementation of data contracts themselves, vendors like Gable.ai make it a point to offer support, training, and resources to help organizations implement their contracts effectively.\n\n4. Perceived risks and uncertainty\n\nFear of the unknown: Some organizations are rightly concerned about security implications regarding automated systems, especially governance tools that may involve the cloud.\n\nWe say ârightlyâ here because data teams in every organization need to ensure they thoroughly understand new and emerging technologies, how they'll retain control of valuable and often personal information, whether or not theyâll become too dependent on automation, and/or how new tools may contribute to system failures or downtime.\n\nHow a data contract can help:\n\nIn these cases, organizations benefit from the proven frameworks for managing data governance tasks that data contracts provide.\n\nAlong with the reduced uncertainty and perceived risks such frameworks provide, data contracts enhance data security and compliance by clearly defining data access and usage policies.\n\nFurthermore, data contracts that offer automated enforcement ensure consistent application of governance policies, reducing the risk of human error.\n\n5. Change management and organizational resistance\n\nEven super-progressive people can be a little resistant to change. So, unsurprisingly, employees accustomed to manual processes can be a bit resistant to substantial changes (like completely automating data governance processes). This resistance often stems from understandable sources: fear of job loss, change in routine, or lack of understanding of the new system's benefits.\n\nIf organizational resistance isnât an issue, data leads still need to ensure that the training required to implement data governance automation doesn't become a roadblock in itself.\n\nHow a data contract can help:\n\nFirst off, data contracts demonstrate clear benefits quickly. When error rates drop and data quality quickly improves, stakeholder buy-in for further changes and improvements gets easier to maintain.\n\nBy defining roles, responsibilities, and expectations, data contracts can also help alleviate fears about job loss or how changes in routine will and will not affect individual employees.\n\nMoreover, the consistent data handling practices that contracts establish and enforce across organizations ultimately make it easier for employees to adapt to (and learn) new systems.\n\n6. Regulatory and compliance hesitation\n\nSome industries have more stringent regulatory requirements than others. Organizations in these industries may be wary of adopting new technologies without clear guidance on compliance.\n\nAutomated systems in these organizations often must be configured precisely to ensure compliance, as mistakes can lead to substantial penalties.\n\nHow a data contract can help:\n\nBy nature, the structured framework that data contracts enforce explicitly defines how data should be handled in compliance with specific regulations. This clear guidance ensures that all automated systems (including those handling governance processes) are configured precisely to meet regulatory requirements.\n\nIn addition to forming a centralized point of control for keeping automated systems compliant, contracts enable the implementation of fine-grained data controls and data usage policies that can adapt as regulatory landscapes evolve.\n\n7. Short-term thinking related to existing manual processes\n\nâIf it ain't broke, why automate it?â Certainly, some organizations are doing just fine right now, operating with entirely manual data governance processes.\n\nAdditionally, organizational leadership focused on short-term ROI may struggle to see theoretical upsides in these situations, especially when framed against sunk costs and established workflows.\n\nHow a data contract can help:\n\nIn business, it can be prohibitive to argue against ROI in general, whether short- or long-term. Instead, quantify how leveraging data contracts to define data expectations, quality standards, and usage guidelines will enhance ROI by marshaling consistent, high-quality data over time.\n\nAs organizations grow and data volumes increase, manual processes will sooner or later prove untenable. At this point, data contracts will already demonstrate the value scalable frameworks have within the organization, setting the stage for how automated data governance will further these longer-term benefits.\n\nEnable the enablement of automated data governance\n\nAutomated data governance offers significant advantages, including enhanced compliance, improved efficiency, cost savings, and better support for advanced analytics and AI. Despite these exceptional advantages, though, challenges such as budget, complexity, and organizational resistance remain. Data contracts present a viable solution to mitigate these issues.\n\nOrganizations looking to stay competitive in todayâs data-driven world should consider starting their journey toward automated data governance by assessing their current capabilities, investing in the necessary tools and training, and gradually integrating automated processes. By doing so, they can ensure their data governance frameworks are robust, scalable, and ready to meet future demands.",
      "# [Data Quality Management: Why It Takes DQM to Cook](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-quality-management)\nDespite what some may claim, the most interesting parts of any business tend to be where the sausage gets made: a critical point in business operations that involves working with raw ingredientsâhandling, processing, shaping, and perfecting how essential elements come together.Â\n\nItâs prep work, and it can make or break the final product. It can also be an intense, demanding, chaotic place to operate. (Just think about The Bear on FX.)\n\nFor data professionals (and those who rely on them), data quality management (DQM) frameworks act as the kitchen where quality data is prepped for use. And the DQM tools, techniques, and processes that live within these frameworks prep raw data into something enterprise organizations can feast upon.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nBut this prep area is often out of sight from most of the data consumers (e.g., data analysts, business intelligence [BI] professionals, decision-makers) who rely heavily on data quality. Thatâs why teaching data consumers about the âback of the houseâ is key to helping them appreciate what good prep work will enable them to do in front of it.Â\n\nSo. Aprons on, everybodyâ¦\n\nWhat is data quality management?\n\nDue to the importance of data in modern business processes and decision-making, most organizations, regardless of size, operate with at least some limited or informal processes and/or tools in place to help support data quality.Â\n\nHowever, data quality management refers to a multifaceted, intentional, and coordinated collection of practices, tools, and methodologies used to ensure organizational data is reliably accurate, consistent, and complete.Â\n\nIn a restaurant, no single employee is wholly responsible for delivering exceptional quality to those who dine there. Similarly, in modern organizations, DQM increasingly intersects with DevOps and DataOps practices, emphasizing continuous integration, continuous delivery, and operational efficiency for data handling processes.\n\nThese methodologies ensure that data quality is maintained throughout the data lifecycle, from development through to deployment and operational use. And this is actually quite important, considering the small army of individuals and roles that play a part in enterprise-scale data quality management.\n\nData consumers: As a typical organization's primary data users, data consumers are uniquely positioned to help define data quality standards and provide feedback on any issues encountered.\n\nData analysts: As part of data interpretation and analysis, analysts clean and prepare data for use. They frequently partner with management to develop strategies for improving data quality and also help to report quality issues during analysis.\n\nData custodians: Within organizations, it's the data custodians who manage and safeguard data assets. Doing so involves storing data securely and performing regular backups. The documentation they keepârecords of data sources, definitions, and metadataâsupport data quality initiatives as part of an organization's overall DQM. But custodians also contribute to data quality management in how they implement precise data controls and monitor data usage.\n\nData producers: Data is produced and introduced to an organization via its unique assortment of data producers. They are responsible for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the data they provide, following established data entry practices and procedures. Producers also validate data at the point of entry into the organizationâpreventing errors from propagating through the system.\n\nData owners: Business unit leaders, project managers, IT managers, and compliance managers often play the role of data owners in an organization. As such, owners have authority over specific datasets and are accountable for their quality. Contributions to DQM at this level include defining data quality standards and policies specific to their data domains. They help monitor data quality, addressing any issues in their respective areas while ensuring that data use complies with organizational and regulatory requirements.\n\nData governance teams: Individuals charged with developing and enforcing policies for effective data management form an organization's data governance team (or teams). Be they one or many, those handling data governance develop and enforce the policies and procedures that serve as the skeletal structure of DQM processes. Additionally, governance teams are key for coordinating consistent data quality efforts across teams and fostering organizational cultures that prioritize data quality and who, subsequently, embrace data as a product.\n\nData quality managers: Overseeing the overall implementation and maintenance of data quality processes, data quality managers monitor the metrics that show if an organization's DQM is working as intended. Quality managers will often also spearhead improvement projects and coordinate with needed stakeholders to resolve high-level issues if and when they arise.\n\nChief data officers: CDOs steer the data quality management ship, charting the course for DQM within their organization. In addition to ensuring all data quality initiatives align with organizational business goals, chief data officers also secure the resources and support that all DQM processes, tools, and methodologies require.\n\nThe 6 key ingredients for effective data quality management\n\nThere are many ways to run a restaurant. Some ingredients, howeverâlike menu quality, location, and strong staff managementâare certainly more important than others.\n\nSo, too, are the ingredients of effective data quality management. There are no universal standards, and in some industries, specific dimensions are viewed more critically than others. But, across the board, these six dimensions (aka VACTUC, for those who really dig acronyms) are key to ensuring effective DQM within an organization.\n\nValidity\n\nHigh-quality data conforms to defined formats, standards, and data quality rules within an organization. Measuring data validity, then, becomes crucial for ensuring that teams can use data effectively without requiring extensive cleaning or correction.\n\nExample: Effective data quality management ensures dates are in the correct format (e.g., DD/MM/YYYY vs. MM/DD/YYYY) and that email addresses follow a valid structure.\n\nAccuracy\n\nAccuracy measures the fidelity to which data correctly represents the real-world entities and values it exists to describe. Highly accurate data is essential for operational efficiency and effective data-driven decision-making.\n\nExample: The phone number recorded for a customer is their actual working phone number (e.g., we know 867-5309 is Jenny's number, who for the price of a dime we can always turn to).\n\nCompleteness\n\nCompleteness, as a key dimension of DQM, refers to the extent to which the organizationâs data is currently available for use. This measurement enables data teams to document whatâs missing when data fields are not all populated, perform the necessary analysis to determine why this is, and create an action plan to collect whatâs needed.\n\nExample: Ensuring that fields relating to key information in a customer record are filled outâname, address, date of birth, customer ID, etc.\n\nTimeliness\n\nWith completeness, DQM measures timeliness to ensure data is both current and currently available when needed. This becomes especially critical in situations where timely decisions need to be made, like in hospitals where providing appropriate care requires real-time patient data.\n\nTimeliness also proves critical for organizations that need to respond to events as they happen, such as those involved in supply chains using real-time data to reroute shipments and avoid potential delays.Â Â\n\nExamples: Current stock levels in retail inventory management, performance data from sensors monitoring factory equipment.\n\nUniqueness\n\nUniqueness demonstrates that records within datasets do not contain duplications. Measuring this dimension as part of data quality management prevents potential inefficiencies in data processing and analysis, as well as results that can be highly inaccurate.\n\nExample: Being able to verify that each product in an inventory system has its own listing which, in turn, prevents issues with stock levels and ordering.\n\nConsistency\n\nBy measuring and maintaining consistency through DQM, data teams ensure organizational data is uniform and reliable across different datasets and systems. This is essential for maintaining a coherent and comprehensive view of data and mitigating discrepancies.\n\nExample: An individual customerâs contact information is consistent across an organizationâs billing, shipping, and customer service systems.\n\nPlanning to prep: How to determine your DQM needs, step by step\n\nMuch like the idea of DQM dimensions, there is no single âbestâ way to put data quality management into practice. For this reason, multiple frameworks existâproviding different strengths and weaknesses. As such, itâs important for data leaders to determine what they need DQM to do within their organization before settling on the best framework to get it done.\n\n1. Assess organizational objectives and needs\n\nAsk what your organization aims to achieve with your data quality management efforts.\n\nWhich of these (e.g., improve operational efficiency, increase customer satisfaction, make our regulatory compliance more cogent) are most critical to the organizationâs overall business goals?\n\nHow is data currently used across the organization?\n\nWhich processes and touchpoints are mission-critical?\n\n2. Evaluate data complexity and your data environment\n\nWhat is the current volume, velocity, and variety of data the organization handles?\n\nWhat are the different data sources (e.g., sensor data, log files, operational systems) and systems (e.g., business intelligence tools, data integration platforms, SQL/NoSQL databases) currently in use?\n\n3. Review all relevant industry requirements\n\nWhich industry-specific regulations and standardsâlike GDPR, CPAA, and HIPAAâinfluence your organizational data?\n\nWhich DQM practices are, and are not, already commonly adopted by peers in your industry?\n\n4. Conduct a thorough current state assessment\n\nAre there existing data quality issues known to data leaders in your organization? If so, how are these issues impacting the business?\n\nWhat is the approximate maturity level of the organizationâs data management practices?\n\n5. Identify both available resources and constraints\n\nWhat is a reasonable budget for a DQM implementation initiative at this time?\n\nWhat existing technologies and tools are available that could support your DQM initiative?\n\nHow many skilled personnel are available for DQM implementation and support? What will ongoing training needs look like?\n\n6. Develop a data quality management assessment and strategy report\n\nA DQM assessment and strategy report consolidates answers and information from the prior steps into a format that will help you research DQM frameworksâmapping each framework to your organizationâs needs.\n\nOnce you select a framework, choose a specific area or project and implement a pilot. This allows you to monitor and measure the efficacy of the framework and gather valuable feedback.\n\nIterate and improve during the pilot process, making any necessary adjustments to ensure your framework can scale across the organization.\n\nOnce the pilot concludes, you should have the ability to effectively communicate the specifics, and specific benefits, of the DQM framework youâve chosen in order to gain buy-in from stakeholders.\n\nMaking data prep work: Best practices post-DQM implementation\n\nWhen the framework selection process is complete and data quality management itself is implemented, data leaders should establish and follow best practices to help ensure ongoing success.\n\nAnchor ongoing efforts to clear data quality metrics and KPIs: Building off the DQM assessment and strategy report, define specific, measurable metrics to assess data quality across key dimensions youâve identified. Additionally, plan to regularly track and report on these KPIsâmonitoring progress while actively identifying areas for improvement.\n\nEstablish data cleansing and standardization processes: Processes for cleansing and standardizing data need to be maintained, not simply developed. These processes should address common issues like missing values, duplicate records, and format inconsistencies.\n\nImplement data integration and master data management: Work to properly integrate data from all sources into each of the organizationâs data environments. Master data management (MDM) can streamline this process by establishing a single source of truth for all critical data elements.\n\nEnable consistent monitoring and improvement: If it doesnât already exist, implement ongoing data quality monitoring and formalize a feedback loop for continuous improvement. Once done, regularly review and update your DQM processes based on emerging insights and changing business needs.\n\nâEnsure data security and privacy compliance: Make sure to incorporate data security and privacy considerations directly into all DQM practices. This way, sensitive information will be protected throughout the data lifecycle and remain compliant with regulations noted in your DQM assessment and strategy.\n\nAutomate data lineage and metadata management: Empower your data custodians to maintain clear documentation of data lineage and metadata. This allows data teams to understand the origins, transformations, and usage of data across the organization. Ideally, however, teams automate their data lineage processes and metadata documentation. In these cases, the role of the data custodians often shiftsâfocusing instead on oversight, quality assurance, exception handling, and optimization.\n\n(While you're at it) Automate data quality checks (too): Favor data quality tools and tech that automate routine checks and validations. This empowers your DQM to catch errors as early in the data lifecycle as possible. Compared to relying on manual quality checks, automation results in more consistency, causes fewer unforced errors, and frees up bandwidth for data teams to spend elsewhere.\n\nConduct regular data profiling and assessments: DQM should provide teams with insights into data structure, content, and quality that only ongoing data profiling can provide. When conducted regularly, these assessments help identify new quality issues and simplify the process of tracking improvements over time.\n\nâEstablish data quality rules and validation: Rules for data entry, validation, and quality control must be clearly defined and implemented organization-wide. This makes it possible for every member of the organization to help ensure data rules get consistently applied across all sources and systems.\n\nChampion strong data governance: Furthering the impact of consistency through DQM, data leaders should consistently enforce data governance policies and procedures. Moreover, developing clear definitions around organizational roles and responsibilities for data stewardship increases accountability throughout the organization.\n\nActively support a data quality culture: Data quality rules, organization-wide accountability, and strong data governance form the foundation of cultures that value data quality and understand the importance of treating data as a product. Build on this foundation by actively promoting data quality awareness as part of standard onboarding and training initiatives.\n\nKeep your stakeholders informed and engaged: Finally, make sure to get stakeholders aware of DQM in action and the data-driven culture it helps foster. Meet with stakeholders from different departments regularly to keep tabs on how their data quality needs and challenges evolve over time. To this end, foster collaboration between IT, data teams, and business units to keep all DQM efforts in full alignment with organizational goals.\n\nAs with any fine dining experience, the culmination of all efforts in data quality management leads to a seamless and satisfying outcome.Â\n\nTo truly master the art of data preparation and ensure your data is consistently of the highest quality, there is one final best practice to consider: data contract implementation as upstream as possible in the data lifecycle.\n\nData contracts: The final ingredient for DQM success\n\nData contracts act as formal agreements between data producers and consumers, clearly defining the expectations, quality standards, and responsibilities for data handling and processing.\n\nMuch like setting the groundwork for a successful kitchen operation, organizations can prevent errors, enhance data quality, and ensure smooth, efficient data workflows from the very beginning by establishing these contracts early.\n\nJust as a well-organized kitchen allows chefs to create culinary masterpieces, upstream data contracts empower your teams to deliver accurate, consistent, and reliable data that drives informed decision-making and operational excellence.Â",
      "# [Data Supply Chains: Supporting the Smartification of ERPs](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-supply-chain)\nFor business professionals across a wide swath of industries who leverage enterprise resource planning (ERP) software in their day-to-dayâthe future is now.Â\n\nThe snowballing advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are now knocking on the door of ERP systems, heralding next-level advancements in automation, optimization, and data-driven competitive advantages ERPs enable. This means the smartification of ERPs is happening now, as you read this.Â\n\nButâ¦why now?\n\nAI-related disruptions have been rippling through the modern business world for nearly 15 years. ERP software became widely adopted in the 1990s and has played a role in business ever since. Why, then, has it taken so long for these two important technological forces to converge?\n\nThree words, and one increasingly important concept:\n\nData. Supply. Chains.\n\nWhat is a data supply chain?\n\nA data supply chain is a formalized series of steps designed to manage the lifecycle of data within organizations. It is conceptually similar to traditional supply chains, which are designed for efficient transportation and distribution of physical goods while maintaining their quality and overall value along the way.\n\nA newer practice in data management, data supply chains have evolved to meet the growing trend of treating data as a product (as opposed to a disposable commodity). In this way, a data supply chain mimics the logistical aspects of traditional supply chainsâfacilitating the collection, processing, analysis, and distribution of information within and across an organization. At the same time, these systems work to maintain optimal data quality and integrity as these processes take place.\n\nAs a system, a data supply chain is typically composed of several key components:\n\nData sources: These components are the organizational origin points where data is either generated or collected. Depending on an organizationâs size and needs, a data supply chain may have a variety of data sources, including company databases, social media, public datasets, and data products like dashboards or data marts.\n\nData acquisition systems: Technology and tools utilized to gather data from an organizationâs data sources. Examples commonly include data collection methods like APIs, direct data entry, web scraping tools, or automated data capture technology like radio frequency identification (RFID).\n\nData storage solutions: Infrastructure used to store data for processing and analysis. These may include traditional databases, data warehousing solutions, or cloud storage services that enable flexible, scalable data storage.\n\nData processing and management tools: Techniques and software used to clean, transform, and manage data, helping correct inaccuracies, remove duplicates, and keep data formatted consistently. Collectively, these typically include ETL (extract, transform, and load) systems, data integration tools, and data quality management software.\n\nData analysis and analytics platforms: Components that analyze data to extract insights by helping organizations identify patterns, trends, and correlations in their data. Examples may include machine learning platforms, business intelligence (BI) tools, and complex data analytics frameworks, in addition to statistical analysis software.\n\nData security and compliance mechanisms: Unsurprisingly, data supply chain components will also include technologies and protocols that ensure compliance with legal and regulatory standards to protect data privacy. These will include access controls (e.g., DAC, MAC, ABAC), data masking, encryption, and auditing systems.\n\nData distribution systems: Methods and technologies needed to share data insights within and outside of an organization are also vital. These can involve dashboard applications, reporting tools, data-sharing APIs, and automated workflow systems that get valuable info into the hands of operations teams and decision-makers.\n\nData archiving and disposal: Finally, we have the aspects of the data supply chain required for securely archiving and deleting data. Data lifecycle management policies and tools that manage, retain, archive, and safely destroy data fill this role.\n\nWhy it took data supply chains to enable ERP smartification\n\nTo be clear, data supply chains are not the only reason ERP solutions are finally beginning to hitch their horses to the AI stampede.\n\nHowever, there are many specific reasons the advent of data supply chains has freed ERPs to fully utilize the potential AI brings to the table:\n\nBolstering data availability and quality\n\nA major prerequisite for effective AI implementation is the consistent availability of large amounts of high-quality data. Once implemented, data supply chains organize and manage the flow of data from data sources.\n\nIn doing so, data supply chains ensure that ERP systems gain and maintain access to the requisite firehose of clean, accurate, timely dataâcreating the robust data environment needed for training AI models and ensuring their accuracy and reliability.\n\nImproving data environment integration\n\nAs with most aspects of data management, data supply chains break down silos within organizations as they begin improving data integration across departments. Integrated data environments are crucial for AI functionality within ERP systems. Increasing overall data integration leads to more comprehensive insights and resilient decision-making processes.\n\nFomenting real-time data processing\n\nData supply chains that support real-time data processing functionality are essential for supporting the up-to-the-minute data AI applications require. This is especially important for ERP solutions that provide demand forecasting that helps manage inventory and sales data in real time.\n\nEnhancing scalability and flexibility\n\nData supply chains provide the scalability and flexibility needed to handle the increasing volume and variety of data that modern businesses generate. This scalability is crucial for AI applications, which often require substantial computational resources and the ability to adapt to changing data inputs and business needs.\n\nFortifying data security and compliance\n\nAI applications often involve sensitive data, and the security and compliance measures integrated into data supply chains ensure that data is handled securely. This is particularly important for ERP systems, which must comply with various regulatory requirements regarding data privacy and security.\n\nBeyond ERPs: 9 ways data supply chains are benefitting organizations overall\n\nItâs worth broadening the aperture here as well to make sure we fully appreciate the holistic impact data supply chains are having within organizations. While these benefits certainly vary across industries, the following nine are proving common and of critical importance:\n\n1. Increased data quality and integrity\n\nAs one of the latest additions to the data management toolkit, data supply chains are proving to be exceptional at ensuring optimal data quality and consistencyâcleaning, normalizing, and validating data within an organization. Knowing this level of data quality is consistently available, data teams can more confidently support the use of advanced analytics and more insightful reporting.\n\n2. Platforming advanced technologies\n\nBy establishing data quality as part of an organizationâs bedrock, day-to-day operations benefit from a more robust data infrastructure. This not only supports more sophisticated uses of automation but also better positions data teams to adopt and implement more sophisticated technologies as they become viable.\n\n3. Enhanced productivity and efficiency\n\nExtensively automating data collection, processing, and distribution through data supply chain implementation reduces manual effort, therefore minimizing human error. In addition to streamlining workflows and speeding up general processes, this automation also helps keep data teams out of the weeds, freeing up valuable time to invest in more strategic, mission-critical tasks.\n\n4. Cost reduction\n\nOptimizing data flows and improving overall data management capabilities helps organizations reduce the overhead cost associated with storing, processing, and retrieving data. Even better? As data supply chains facilitate better data-driven decision-making, resource allocation also improves, leading to further cuts to operational expenses.\n\n5. Risk management and compliance\n\nCost reduction without the need to compromise risk management and compliance is the peanut butter and jelly of the data management world. Data supply chains enable exactly thisâproviding invaluable means for monitoring, analyzing, and reporting on risk factors while ensuring compliance with relevant protection regulations by enriching data access, data handling, and data archiving/disposal practices.\n\n6. Agility and scalability\n\nCompared to competitors that donât have them, organizations using data supply chains are able to adapt, scale, and pivot with more agility as markets change. Increasingly, the ability to do so is crucial for maintaining resilience and responsiveness in data-driven industries.\n\n7. Innovation and new opportunities\n\nData supply chains improve an organizationâs ability to identify trends, patterns, and gaps in the market. By identifying these opportunities for innovation sooner, teams gain the advantageâenjoying more time to explore and develop new products, services, and business models.\n\n8. Improved organizational decision-making\n\nAdditionally, data supply chains enable the integration and analysis of data from diverse sources. This can provide comprehensive insights that inform strategic and operational decisions across the organization. Untempered access to real-time data and advanced analytics also allows business leaders to make more informed, data-driven decisions that increase their competitive advantage.\n\n9. Enhanced customer experiences\n\nFinally (and ultimately), organizations are using the insights gained from data supply chains to better understand customer needs, preferences, and behaviors, facilitating more effective and engaging customer engagement strategies.\n\nKey focus areas for planning data supply chain implementation\n\nJust as when logistics professionals plan to implement supply chain management, there are specifics data pros should focus on to help ensure their data supply chain initiatives are successful:\n\nStrategic alignment and clear objectivessome text\n\nAs with all mission-critical initiatives, make sure you set the stage with a clear strategy for your data supply chain and confirm that this strategy aligns with overall business goals and objectives.Â\n\nCultural change and trainingsome text\n\nAs part of this strategy, donât sleep on organizational culture. Those organizations that are already embracing data as a product may have less to focus on here. However, the more data leaders work to ensure a culture that both understands and values data quality, the more fluid the data supply chain implementation will be.\n\nSometimes, this doesnât take more than providing basic (yet consistent) training and resources to ensure staffâat all levelsâwill effectively support their data supply chain.\n\nData governance and performance measurementÂ some text\n\nPlan how the data supply chain will function as part of your established governance framework, further clarifying roles, responsibilities, and standards for overall data quality and security.\n\nEvaluate key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics to ensure, post-implementation, you can continue to track progress and measure the effectiveness of the data supply chain against set goals.\n\nResilience and the need for continuous improvementâ\n\nBe sure to identify potential disruptions and vulnerabilities within the data supply chain, along with contingency plans to enhance its resilience.\n\nEstablish methods of assessment and optimization to ensure that data supply chain processes will improve continuously over time. Additionally, redouble efforts to identify new technologies and methodologies that can improve the supply chain post-implementation.\n\nWhile key software and systems like ERPs stand to benefit on day 1, the data supply chain itself deserves its own love and attention (and plenty of investment) over time.\n\nEmbracing the chain, and ensuring the first link holds true\n\nSo, while data supply chains are (finally!) helping teams glean the full potential of enterprise-scale ERPs, theyâre redefining whatâs achievable through organization-wide digital transformation. Digital supply chains certainly earn attention for making this possible.Â\n\nBut let us not forget, the strength of any chainâlogistical, data-centric, or the one keeping your bike safe during the workweekâis only as strong as its first link. As the stakes increase, data contracts should be an essential aspect of any supply chain initiative.Â\n\nLearn more about how, and why, data contracts can help the smartification of ERPs extend throughout your organization and beyond.",
      "# [The Pragmatistâs Guide to Data Management Frameworks](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-management-framework)\nData professionals are an increasingly diverse bunch. But one tie that binds our professional cadre is pragmatism. Data processes that lack practicality will, by design, struggle to function with the efficiency, effectiveness, and ability modern organizations increasingly rely upon.\n\nPragmatism keeps us focused on outcomes that directly support business goals. It helps us balance the positive tension between resource optimization and the need for data teams and infrastructure to remain flexible and adaptable while we curate the data lifecycle.Â\n\nItâs the reason we approach hard problems, difficult conversations with stakeholders, and the growing ethical considerations of data management. Of all the isms, pragmatism ensures weâre not just solving problemsâour solution is as practical as it is potent.\n\nThis is why itâs imperative to know how a pragmatic approach to formalizing a robust data management framework naturally benefits data stewards, data consumers, and data assets alike.Â\n\nWhat is a data management framework?\n\nData management frameworks are structured models that guide organizations in effectively managing their data by providing the following structure:\n\nOutline policies and principles by defining an organizationâs fundamental guidelines and procedures for data handling\n\nSet standards by determining the criteria for data processes and formats\n\nProvide best practices by prescribing effective methods and techniques for managing data\n\nInclude both tools and methodologies to provide systematic approaches and instruments for all stages of an organizationâs data lifecycle\n\nIn general, data professionals employ various data management frameworks to serve as a blueprint for planning, executing, and monitoring data management strategies. These frameworks align these activities with business goals, making them mission-critical for organizations that need to manage their data effectively (i.e., all of them).Â\n\nAs such, these management frameworks are typically established during the planning and design phases of data projects or system implementations. When put in place before data collection begins, before data consumers put that data to work, proper data governance can occur. Preemptively established, these management frameworks also contribute to the overall quality of data, data security, and compliance.\n\nHow the importance of data management frameworks differs between industries\n\nBased on pragmatism, the key considerations of a data management framework may not vary much between industries. The specifics, however, certainly do.Â\n\nOrganizations in all industries benefit, more or less, from effective data management. Major factors such as regulatory requirements (as mentioned earlier), operational needs, and data sensitivity can vary greatly between industriesâeven potentially affecting the value of the data management framework itself.Â\n\nRegulatory requirements\n\nThe need for data compliance is an excellent example of a factor that impacts every organization using data, but some certainly more than others. The healthcare and financial services industries especially rely on robust data management frameworks to enable stringent data protection and privacy regulations.Â\n\nFor instance, healthcare organizations must ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information (PHI). In the banking and financial services industry (BFSI), data management frameworks must contend with highly regulated financial laws, in addition to a multitude of data privacy protection regulations.Â\n\nOperational needs\n\nSome industries simply consume more data than others, employing data management frameworks to tame the torrents of data that day-to-day operations and strategic decision-making rely on.\n\nRetail and ecommerce stand out here. These sectors rely heavily on big data analytics, machine learning (ML), and data modeling to manage inventory and supply chains at scale. They comb through mountains of customer info for insights, and deliver highly personalized marketing.\n\nData sensitivity\n\nYet other industries trust their data management frameworks to ensure they can deal with highly sensitive data. This places a comparatively higher priority on mitigating data breaches, attempts at fraud, identity theft, and maintaining consumer trust.Â\n\nThe government and public sectors handle information that requires exceptionally stringent data management to protect citizens' information and national security matters. Alternatively, the telecommunications industry processes massive amounts of data trafficâa capability that wouldnât be possible without a pragmatic framework maintaining operational efficiency and service quality.\n\nKey considerations for implementing a pragmatic data management framework\n\nFortunately, ensuring data management frameworks align with enterprise data and IT infrastructures requires consideration, not complexity.Â\n\nIn fact, the following nine considerations can help optimize implementation in most use cases.Â\n\n1. Ensure your alignment with business goals\n\nTake the pragmatic first step by prioritizing outcomes. Take time to highlight how your framework should serve relevant and specific business outcomes. Common outcomes include improved or more data-driven decision-making and increased operational efficiency or customer satisfaction.\n\nFacilitate goal-driven strategies by discussing the data management framework with all relevant stakeholders. Listen to what they say. Itâs important to tailor data management practices to the unique needs of the business because a one-size-fits-all approach rarely fits an organizationâs needs in the long term.\n\n2. Plan for scalability and flexibility\n\nData management frameworks must be adaptable. During the implementation process, stress the importance of the data governance framework, which needs to scale and adapt if business needs or technologies evolve (because, friend, they always do).\n\nLeverage use cases here, tooâreal-world scenarios that help you demonstrate the benefits delivered when frameworks can scale and adapt to businesses of different sizes and industries.Â\n\n3. Verify framework integration with existing systems\n\nFollow practical integration strategies, describing how new data management practices will integrate with existing IT infrastructure and systems.Â\n\nAdditionally, recommend tools and technologies that promote seamless integration.\n\n4. Lay the foundation for data quality and governance\n\nA data management framework should help form the bedrock of treating data as a product within your organization. Emphasize optimal data strategy and ways for ensuring data quality and accuracy throughout the data lifecycle.\n\nEncourage everyone within the organization to share the responsibility of maintaining high data quality. Moreover, outline robust data governance practices within your framework. Balance the pragmatic governance practices needed to enable secure, compliant, ethical data usage with reasonable administrative overhead.\n\n5. Formalize âdata quality as cultureâ\n\nAs your framework helps grade the foundation of how your organization treats its data, look for ways it can also help promote data literacy and fluency among all employees.Â\n\nAsk yourself: How can a data management framework promote data democratization? What can be done to foster data transparency, usability, and accessibility? Would incentives and rewards help establish and reinforce good habits?Â\n\nAnd whatâs it going to take to get leadership on board? Because a pragmatist knows they absolutely need to be.Â\n\n6. Be realistic about resilient risk management\n\nIdentify potential risks as often as possible and establish plans to mitigate them. Discuss this part of the process as well. Work with key players in the organization to get a 360-degree assessment of potential risks to the data management process.Â\n\nThe pragmatic data management framework should also provide insights into integrating compliance with all relevant protection regulations. Including this in the framework helps set the expectation that integration with various regulatory bodiesâregional, national, and globalâwill be a natural part of the data management process.Â\n\n7. Encourage cost and resource efficiency\n\nWhile working through a data management framework, hunt for ways to get more done using fewer resources. Be a loud voice in the room for cost-effective and efficient data management practices to maximize the ROI of all data management activities.Â\n\nPlan how to optimize resources over time while maintaining the fidelity of data quality and security.Â Â\n\n8. Bake in methods for measurement and continuous improvement\n\nDefine clear metrics and KPIs to measure the ongoing effectiveness of your data management practices.Â\n\nFrameworks should promote an iterative improvement approach to data management. The ongoing learning and adaptation required help organizations more easily adapt to regulatory and technology changes while also supporting valuable feedback loops.\n\n9. Outline actionable and specific guidance\n\nFinally, the pragmatic data management framework will provide clear, crisp, actionable steps to guide its own implementation.Â\n\nTo this end, checklists, templates, and workflows that assist during the implementation process can also prove invaluable.\n\nManaging common framework implementation challenges\n\nRegardless of industry, data teams face common challenges when implementing a data management framework.Â\n\nHandling each involves tackling unique issues, ranging from the strategic to the cultural. But their collective commonality makes them easier to anticipate and account for.\n\nNeeds and gaps\n\nOne reality of the business world is that there is often a delta between the priorities of data teams and other business units. This is usually the case when data initiatives proposed via a pragmatic data management framework are received as low-priority, not deserving of support and funding, or even irrelevant.Â\n\nUnfortunately, this canât be left as an agreement to disagree. Without clear business goal alignment, even the most passionate data management efforts can grow listlessâstill focused on achievements, yes. But with little or no impact on delivering business value.Â\n\nHuman psychologyÂ\n\nProblematic deltas between teams and departments can also be products of change resistance within organizational culture. Pushback regarding the adoption of new tools and processes can strike data professionals as superfluous. But messing with a collectiveâs comfort zones can quickly snowball, resulting in implementation delays and, potentially, entire initiatives being derailed.Â\n\nAs much as possible, work to align the data management framework with the organizationâs culture as-is. Sometimes, the best conflicts are avoided completely. Alternately (or additionally) include actionables within the framework to gradually align the cultural norms with ideal data management practices.Â\n\nHighlighting early successes during the frameworkâs implementation can also be useful, as can appointing enthusiastic and like-minded data champions throughout the organizationâpartners who can help advocate for new tools and processes.\n\nOperational rigidity\n\nApart from culture, some organizations simply have rigid operational structures that arenât naturally inclined to adopt changes the data management framework will necessitate. Operational rigidity, in this sense, can stonewall the adoption of data best practices or make it difficult (if not impossible) to foster the concept of data as a product organization-wide.Â\n\nData management frameworks that take the pragmatic approach will endeavor to find flexibility and stakeholder engagement. These facets alone can begin dissolving counter-productively rigid processes and points of view. Whatâs more, planning to break the implementation process down into phases can make changes and challenges to established practices more digestible.Â\n\nBeginning this phase-based approach with pilot projects in less rigid areas of the organization can also prove helpful. In addition to provoking less initial resistance, successful pilots can demonstrate the benefits of the new data management practices the framework entails. You can also leverage these successes as case studies to advocate for broader organizational support.Â\n\nOperationalizing governance\n\nEffective data governance relies on employees having a crystal-clear understanding of who can (and/or should) take which action, upon which data, using which methods in which situations. An ongoing lack of this clarity can produce conflicts over data ownership, data accessibility issues, operational inefficiencies, and decision-making processes.\n\nGaining and maintaining this clarity, on the other hand, requires active and ongoing cross-departmental agreement and cooperation. This can be difficult to achieve. But the pragmatic data professional should consider it essential.\n\nTechnical technicalities\n\nLegacy systems can be inflexible, especially when compared to contemporary solutions and technology. Donât be surprised to find a legacy system does not support your designs for a modern data management framework.Â\n\nTackling legacy issues is often complicated because they require time, money, and talent to resolve. Cost-benefit analysis can at least put the investment needed to correct these issues into perspective, as potential ROI and other benefits serve as a holistic counterfactual.\n\nProductizing dataÂ\n\nWith inaccuracies, incompleteness, and inconsistencies, data quality issues must be continuously rooted out and corrected. Much like tackling legacy technology, data quality bug hunts can also be resource-intensive. For this reason, and the mission-critical need to maintain optimal data quality, data professionals must be sure that these corrections donât detract from more strategic data activities.Â\n\nBalancing operational efficiency with data quality can be tricky. As part of your data management framework, identify strategic places to foster data quality. Make sure you parse critical data from all data to focus quality efforts on the former.Â\n\nAdditionally, assess the effects data quality issues can have in different areas of your organization. This will help you prioritize efforts where risks to business outcomes are highest.Â\n\nResource constraints\n\nAnother business truism is that budgets, time, and skilled personnel will always be limited. Resource deficits can restrict the totality of data management initiatives scoped within a framework.\n\nFor pragmatists, it can be difficult to embrace these constraints as constructive. But they are further reasons for strategically identifying critical points of data quality and risk-based thinking. Inevitably, certain data functions will need to be prioritized over others. A data management framework should help guide these difficult conversions toward the best possible outcomes.\n\nSecurity and privacy concerns\n\nData accessibility and usability are crucial for democratizing data and treating it as a valuable product. However, balancing the needs of data consumers with regulations and compliance can be a complicated dance. In organizations with sensitive data, an overemphasis on security can hamper consumers' ability to access and use the data they need.Â\n\nRole-based access control (RBAC), when implemented as part of the framework, makes sense for many larger organizations. Limiting who can access what data goes a long way toward ensuring sensitive data remains protected. Moreover, systematically classifying data according to sensitivity levels can make it easier to balance security with accessibility.\n\nFor organizations where RBAC may be unnecessary or prohibitive (e.g., smaller teams or organizations, highly collaborative or research-driven work environments), attribute-based access control (ABAC) or discretionary access control (DAC) models may prove more pragmatic.\n\nMeaningful measurementÂ\n\nFinally, developing metrics to assess the effectiveness of data management practices (and their impact on business objectives the framework is aligned to) can get complicated. But sans meaning metrics, it becomes difficult for data professionals to justify continued investments in data management.Â\n\nA management frameworkâs alignment with clearly defined business objectives sets a helpful foundation for measurement and performance evaluation. To this end, KPI-related discussions should help ensure performance metrics are relevant to said business outcomes. Balanced scorecards (BSC) also help ensure that chosen KPIs are strategically comprehensiveâconsisting of a holistic mix of financial, customer, growth, and internal process metrics.\n\nProfessionals should also ensure multiple data quality dimensions will be measured and that automated data quality tools continuously monitor and report on these metrics, providing ongoing insights into data management performance.\n\nPracticing preemptive pragmatism\n\nAs we conclude our journey through the pragmatic approaches to data management frameworks, itâs clear that the challenges and opportunities detailed above require strategic consideration and (ideally) preemptive action. Data contracts can serve as a key tool in this regardâsupporting robust data management frameworks before implementation even begins.\n\nData contracts establish explicit guidelines and expectations for data handling, usage, and security. For data professionals seeking to be pragmatic, they offer a structured and clear framework to ensure compliance, improve collaboration, and maintain high data integrity and privacy standards. They also serve as binding agreements that outline the responsibilities of all parties involved and provide a solid foundation for governance and operational consistency across various data initiatives.\n\nSo, whether youâre looking to refine your current framework or build a new one from the ground up, Gableâs approach to data contract drafting and enforcement should be considered a prerequisite to data management success.",
      "# [Automated Data Lineage: Why Do, How To, And Types Of Tools To Use](https://www.gable.ai/blog/automated-data-lineage)\nThe importance of organizational access to data lineage continues to grow, as weâve detailed elsewhere on the blog.\n\nAt the scale modern businesses utilize (and increasingly rely upon) data, itâs data lineage processes that foster data quality and trust, regulatory compliance, and operational efficiency. Simultaneously, it supports robust data governance (among other operational criticalities).\n\nThis is why itâs important for data teams to get their data lineage right. And that, friends, calls for partial, if not complete, automation of an organizationâs data lineage processes.\n\nAnd for good reason(s).\n\nWhy automated data lineage is becoming the new normal\n\nMost organizations now strive to maximize the value of their data assets and ensure data-driven decision-making. This makes automated data lineage an increasingly critical component of modern data management strategies.\n\nBy leveraging tools to automate their data lineage processes, organizations gain access to a potent mix of benefits.\n\nBetter scalability and efficiency: As data volumes and complexity continue to grow, manual data lineage tracking becomes increasingly time-consuming, error-prone, and impractical. Automated data lineage tools can handle large and complex data environments, providing real-time lineage updates with minimal human effort.\n\nImproved data quality: Automated data lineage enables organizations to identify and resolve data quality issues more efficiently. By tracing data flows and transformations, organizations can pinpoint the root cause of data quality problems and take corrective actions promptly.\n\nEnhanced data governance: Automated data lineage supports robust data governance practices by providing transparency into data flows, transformations, and dependencies. This visibility enables organizations to enforce data policies, ensure compliance with regulations, and maintain a clear audit trail.\n\nAccess to impact analysis: With automated data lineage, organizations can perform comprehensive impact analysis, assessing the potential effects of changes to data sources or transformations on downstream systems and processes. This proactive approach minimizes disruptions and ensures data consistency.\n\nImproved operational efficiency: By automating the tracking of data lineage, organizations can reduce the time and effort required for manual data mapping, allowing IT teams to focus on strategic initiatives rather than routine data management tasks.\n\nEnhanced collaboration and knowledge sharing: Automated data lineage tools often provide visualization capabilities, enabling data teams to collaborate more effectively and share knowledge about data flows and dependencies across the organization.\n\nMore robust regulatory compliance: Detailed data lineage documentation is essential for demonstrating compliance with various data protection and privacy regulations, such as GDPR, CCPA, and industry-specific standards. Automated data lineage tools streamline the process of generating audit trails and maintaining compliance.\n\nHow to automate data lineage in your organization\n\nFor most organizations, the following steps provide a general sense of how data teams will approach automating their data lineage processes.\n\n1. Begin with planning and assessment\n\nIt's wise to begin any data engineering initiative by evaluating the organization's data landscapeâidentifying key data sources, processes, and systems that require lineage tracking.\n\nThe team should then clearly outline objectives and goals as part of this step. Automated data lineage is a means to an endâan end that often includes improving data quality, compliance, and operational efficiency.\n\n2. Select the right tools\n\nThere are tools designed specifically for data lineage automation, such as erwin Data Intelligence, Atlan, and Alation. However, most organizations will have already invested in other tools that, while not specifically engineered for data lineage automation, can help in the automation process (we'll touch on a few of those shortly).\n\nThis is why starting this process with planning and assessment is so valuable, as it should be clear what the best way forward will be. That said, ensure any tools added to the environment will integrate seamlessly with your existing data infrastructure.\n\nA given solutionâbe that a tool or combination of toolsâshould offer comprehensive data lineage tracking at the column level, not simply at the table level and/or in a downstream analytics database. Anything less will fall short of offering comprehensive data management.\n\n3. Implement incrementally\n\nKicking things off with a small-scale pilot enables you to test how you've set up tools and refine your approach to automate the mapping and documentation of data as it flows across systems.\n\nAt this point, data contracts should (ideally) be integrated into the process to enforce data quality and governance standards. This will ensure that ongoing automated data lineage processes adhere to all relevant policies.\n\n4. Enable continuous monitoring and maintenance\n\nAt this point, implement monitoring systems to ensure the accuracy and completeness of lineage information as the system automatically tracks data lineage.\n\nRefine and update both processes and documentation as changes in the data environment occur. Additionally, regularly review and update data contracts and governance policies, maintaining compliance with regulations and standards.\n\n5. Foster stakeholder collaboration\n\nWork with business and technical teams to foster alignment and buy-in with your objectives and goals.\n\nTraining can serve a dual purpose hereâfurthering alignment for users learning to interface with the automated lineage tools, and the role data contracts and governance policies will play moving forward.\n\n6. Review and optimize regularly\n\nRemember: Automation in data engineering is never a âset it and forget itâ proposition. Your newly automated data lineage processes will still need periodic reviews and tuning to ensure maximum effectiveness.\n\nThese periodic reviews also create opportunities to scale your data lineage solutions as the organization's data environment grows and changes.\n\nBest practices for automated data lineage processes\n\nSimilar to the wisdom inherent in âmeasure twice, cut once,â the right steps for automating data lineage implemented in the right order serve as best practices, of a sort.\n\nThat said, incorporating automated data discovery, pattern-based lineage techniques, metadata management integration, and behavioral science considerations, while optional to some organizations, can further enhance your data lineage automation efforts.\n\nAutomated data discovery: Incorporating automated data discovery mechanisms into your data lineage automation process can be a significant time-saver compared to manual tracing. Additionally, tools that offer automated data discovery features frequently identify patterns, anomalies, and connections that are easy to overlook manually.Â\n\nFor those who have automated their data lineage already, automated data discovery can also help uncover hidden relationships and transformations in your existing data flows that were missed during the initial planning and assessment phase.Â\n\nPattern-based lineage techniques: Adopting pattern-based lineage techniques can minimize the need for manual code inspection. Pattern-based lineage uses metadata patterns to infer data transformations, reducing a data teamâs reliance on parsing code directly.Â\n\nOn the whole, this can simplify the data lineage automation process, making it much more scalable.Â\n\nIntegrating with metadata management solutions: Metadata capture and management is essential for maintaining accurate and up-to-date data lineage information.Â\n\nTherefore, consider integrating specific metadata management solutions (e.g., data catalogs, business glossaries, master data management [MDM] tools) in your lineage automation processes to ensure all relevant details are recorded at each step of the data lifecycleâsources, changes, personnel involved in each step, etc.\n\nTap into the benefits of behavioral science: Finally, do not (i.e., never) sleep on the potential benefits behavioral science holds for data engineering teams. Apropos of our focus here, data lineage modeling can provide valuable insights into how data is used and interpreted within a given organization.Â\n\nHow does this help you automate your data lineage processes? Simply put, it doesnât. But weâd kindly remind you to reap what you sow. Better data lineage should be one means to an organizational end.Â\n\nAs automation helps your processes improve, make sure you are cultivating the ensuing information gains to design more intuitive and user-friendly solutions, promote the holistic embrace of data as a product, and foster a more data-driven culture within your org.\n\nCommon tools you can use to automate your data lineage processes\n\nAs mentioned, some data engineering teams may opt to use tools designed specifically for data lineage automation to ensure their processes are pristine. Many others, though, will work to utilize the portfolio of tools and tech the organization has already invested in. In these cases, and as part of the planning and assessment process, it might prove beneficial to approach automated data lineage as a minimum viable product (MVP).\n\nFor example, a potential MVP here could focus on automating basic data lineage tracking and visualization capabilities for a specific set of data sources or systems. Teams could then plan out how to integrate additional featuresâadvanced data quality checks, impact analysis, robust compliance supportâin subsequent iterations based on user feedback and evolving requirements.\n\nAs such, the following four tools are widely used across industries, making the chances good one more of them will be part of a given data teamâs solutioning:\n\ndbt (data build tool)\n\nAs an open-source command line tool, dbt enables data teams to transform data in cloud data warehouses using analytics engineering best practices.Â\n\nIt focuses on the \"T\" (transformation) part of the ELT (i.e., extract, load, transform) process, allowing users to write SQL models that define data transformations. It also integrates with modern data platforms, provides testing and documentation capabilities, and follows software engineering workflows like version control and CI/CD.\n\nPros:\n\nWidely adopted and popular tool for data transformation and analytics engineering\n\nProvides table-level data lineage visualization out-of-the-box\n\nEncourages good practices like documentation, version control, and collaboration\n\nCan be integrated with other tools to enhance lineage capabilities\n\nCons:\n\nLacks native column-level lineage tracking, which is essential for comprehensive lineage\n\nLimited to tracking lineage within its own models and transformations\n\nMay require additional tools or custom development to achieve end-to-end lineage\n\nPricing:\n\ndbt provides users with the choice of a free open-source version and dbt Cloud, which starts at $50/user/month.\n\nMANTA\n\nMANTA is a data lineage tool that provides automated, end-to-end lineage tracing across various systems and technologies.Â\n\nIt maps data flows, including direct and indirect dependencies, to help organizations understand, analyze impact, ensure data quality, and comply with regulations.

      "# [Semantic Data Models and Data Contracts: A True Dream Team](https://www.gable.ai/blog/semantic-data-models)\nSemantic data modeling isnât new. But as the digital world and big data continue to permeate our daily lives, semantic data modeling has taken on renewed importance. Semantics and formal ontologies are now crucial for creating and managing interoperable and accessible datasets for data consumers. But despite the vital role it currently plays, modern modeling still suffers from some traditional issues.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nComplexity and scalability continue to be a challenge. As does the need for these models to continue to integrate data sources and ensure the consistency that makes maintaining semantic integrity possible.\n\nFortunately, well-drafted data contracts can mitigate these issues while maximizing the benefits of semantic data modeling. But understanding why involves appreciating the specifics of semantic data models.\n\nWhat are semantic data models?\n\nSemantic data models are a type of data model that defines not only the structure of data but also the meaning and relationships of the data elements within the model itself. In this way, semantic models do more than simply organize data fields and data typesâthey provide a framework for representing data in a way that is meaningful to both humans and machines.\n\nIn general, here are the common benefits that semantic data models provide in practice:\n\nEstablish relationships and interconnections: By defining how different pieces of data are related to each other, and what the nature of each relationship is, semantic models make it possible to understand the interconnectedness of data elements.\n\nLeverage ontologies and taxonomies: Semantic data modeling often involves the use of ontologies and taxonomies. Ontologies define a set of concepts and categories in a subject area or domain and specify how they relate. Taxonomies provide a hierarchical classification or categorization of data.\n\nEnrich data analysis: Semantic data models allow for more sophisticated and meaningful data analysis. By doing so, they enable the extraction of insights that would be difficult to parse out using traditional data models.\n\nBenefit various domains: Semantic data models are used in various fields, including knowledge management, data integration, artificial intelligence, and semantic web technologies. They are particularly useful in complex domains where data interrelationships are critical to understanding the data.\n\nFacilitate data integration: In these complex domains, which involve the integration of diverse data sources, semantic data models can enable different systems to share and understand data consistently, even when the data structures in the underlying systems are different.\n\nDiffering types and uses of semantic data models\n\nWith so many uses in so many different industries, it should be no surprise that there are a variety of types, methods, and approaches to semantic data modeling, each suited to specific needs and scenarios.\n\nThese variations reflect the diverse ways in which data's meaning, context, and relationships can be represented and managed. To provide a health sample of this diversity, here are nine different types, approaches, and methods of this versatile form of data modeling:\n\n1. Ontology-based modeling\n\nOntologies are formal representations of knowledge with a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts. Ontology-based modeling is a type of semantic data modeling used to create a structured framework of domain knowledge while facilitating data interoperability, sharing, and reuse.\n\nCommon uses: Healthcare, ecommerce, information technology, academic research, financial services, and manufacturing\n\n2. Resource description frameworks (RDF)\n\nRDF is a standard model for data interchange on the web, enabling the integration of diverse data sources regardless of their underlying schema. It uses triples, a structure comprising a subject, predicate, and object, to represent data and its relationships. As such, this type of semantic data modeling excels at describing the interrelationships within data sets.\n\nCommon uses: Web technology, internet services, healthcare, library and information science, financial services, ecommerce, academic research, and the government and public sectors\n\n3. Web ontology language (OWL)\n\nOWL is used in conjunction with RDF to provide a more expressive ontology language with greater capability to represent complex relationships between entities. Used together to form a robust framework for semantic data modeling, OWL is of particular use in complex domains requiring nuanced data interpretation and analysis.\n\nCommon uses: Healthcare, ecommerce and retail, academic research, information technology, financial services, and the government and public sectors\n\n4. Knowledge graphs and graphic databases\n\nAs two approaches to semantic data modeling, knowledge graphs and graphic databases are similar, yet distinct.\n\nBoth represent data in a graph format, emphasizing relationships and connections between entities (nodes). However, knowledge graphs focus more on the meaning and context of information, often aligning with concepts from the Semantic Web (like RDF and OWL). Alternately, graphic databases tend to focus more on data structure and connectivity, and may not include the level of semantic richness that knowledge graphs provide.\n\nThere is also a healthy amount of overlap between the industries both are commonly used in. However, their actual use within these industries will differ, depending on how much rich semantic understanding or network analysis and efficient data traversal are required, respectively.\n\nCommon uses: Healthcare, finance, ecommerce, technology, and research\n\n5. Linked data\n\nAnother approach to semantic data modeling is linked data, a method of publishing structured data so that it can be interlinked and become more useful. This approach involves using standard web technologies like Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to turn the web itself into a global database of sorts, facilitating a more integrated and comprehensive understanding of widely available data.\n\nCommon uses: Academic and scientific research, healthcare, cultural and heritage institutions, ecommerce, finance, and banking\n\n6. Conceptual data modeling\n\nConceptual data modeling is yet another approach to semantic data modeling. But, as opposed to making connections across the web like Linked Data seeks to do, conceptual data modeling is more frequently applied to internal data architecture and planning.\n\nThis is often done before a more robust semantic data model is established, as conceptual data models present a clear and easy-to-understand view of the data entities, their attributes, and relationships within a particular domain.\n\nCommon uses: Healthcare, banking and finance, education, telecommunications, transportation and logistics, and energy and utilities\n\n7. Frame-based modeling\n\nFrame-based modeling is a method of semantic data modeling based on the idea of frames (i.e., data structures for representing stereotyped situations) as nodes in a semantic network. Each frame contains information about how to use the frame, what kind of links it has to other frames, and what kind of objects can fill its slots.\n\nFrame-based modeling is particularly useful for representing knowledge in a way that is understandable to both humans and machines. This makes it particularly valuable in scenarios where the data involves complex relationships or where there is a need to represent nuanced or detailed aspects of the data's semantics.\n\nCommon uses: AI and machine learning, robotics, healthcare, gaming, environmental sciences, the automotive industry, and the legal industry\n\n8. Semantic querying and SPARQL\n\nSemantic querying is another method of semantic data modeling that involves querying data by using its semantics or meaning, as opposed to relying solely on its structure. This approach to querying enables more sophisticated and intuitive queries, especially in complex databases where the relationships and attributes are defined in terms of their real-world meanings.\n\nSPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) is a specific query language and a protocol used for semantic querying in RDF (Resource Description Framework) databases. Itâs a cornerstone technology in the area of the Semantic Web, enabling detailed and complex queries over diverse data sources.Â\n\nThis ability is highly valuable in, for instance, drug interaction analysis, where sophisticated data querying, particularly through machine learning methods, is essential for efficiently predicting unknown drug interactions.\n\nCommon uses: Healthcare, pharmaceuticals and life sciences, media and publishing, ecommerce, academic research, and finance and banking\n\n9. Topic maps\n\nFinally, topic maps are also an approach to semantic data modeling. They provide a way to organize and navigate through complex sets of topics or subjects by defining the associations and properties of these topics. This approach is particularly useful for structuring and retrieving information in a way that reflects its meaning and context, making it a valuable part of the semantic data modeling toolkit.\n\nCommon uses: Academic research, library sciences, and web architecture\n\nWhat are the use cases for semantic data models?\n\nWith semantic data modeling benefitting so many industries, there are a variety of use cases that can provide a sense of their potential impact and value in real-world scenarios. However, a quick look at their use in research, healthcare, and knowledge management can be particularly instructive.Â\n\nResearch\n\nResearch projects, like those found in scientific studies, often involve complex relationships where data is both interconnected and multidimensional.Â\n\nFor instance, in genetic research, semantic data models can represent the relationships between genes, diseases, and treatments, capturing not just the data but also its interconnected nature and implications. Without the latter, researchers would be unable to study the complex interactions and patterns that are a vital part of understanding genetics.Â\n\nHealthcareÂ\n\nIn healthcare, data comes from a wide variety of data sourcesâclinical trials, medical imaging, patient records, insurance information, and data from clinical trials, to name just a few. This means healthcare data needs to adhere to many different standards.Â\n\nHowever, semantic data models can unify this multitude of patient data, treatment information, and clinical guidelines, which can enable healthcare providers to work with a holistic view of a given patientâs health status and treatment options. This results in better patient care, more personalized treatment options, and more efficient healthcare overall.Â\n\nKnowledge management\n\nIn knowledge management (KM), the ever-present challenge is to organize and categorize vast amounts of data, making it retrievable at the precise moment itâs most useful.Â\n\nAs part of the practice of KM, semantic data models can be leveraged to create knowledge bases that center on the meaning of the data, where documents, employee profiles, metadata, and inter-departmental information are linked contextually. This facilitates the relevancyânot just accessibilityâof important information, enhancing learning while better supporting decision-making processes.Â\n\nHow do data contracts support semantic data models?\n\nData contracts complement semantic data models in a lot of ways, creating a synergy that enhances the effectiveness, data quality, reliability, and legal compliance of data management.Â\n\nHere's a breakdown of how that relationship works:\n\nDefinition and structure: Semantic data models provide a structured way to define data, including its meaning and relationships. Data contracts complement this by legally defining how this structured data can be used, shared, and managed, ensuring that the operational use of the data adheres to agreed-upon terms.\n\nStandardization and consistency: Semantic models aim for consistency in data interpretation. Data contracts reinforce this by setting standardized rules for data handling, which helps maintain the integrity and consistency of the data as per the semantic modelâs design.\n\nLegal and ethical compliance: While semantic models organize data for effective use, data contracts ensure compliance with legal and ethical standards like GDPR or HIPAA. This is crucial when the semantic model processes personal or sensitive data.\n\nInteroperability: Semantic models often need to integrate data from diverse sources. Data contracts can specify the terms of use and sharing protocols, facilitating smoother interoperability and data exchange between different systems or entities.\n\nRisk management: Data contracts mitigate risks associated with data misuse or misinterpretation. By setting clear guidelines, they ensure that the semantic interpretations of data are used appropriately, reducing the risk of legal or reputational damage.\n\nWhy data contracts set semantic data modeling up for success\n\nThe symbiosis between data contracts and semantic data models is pivotal in navigating the complexities of the modern digital landscape. As we've explored, this partnership not only enhances the structure and interpretation of data but also ensures legal compliance and risk management.Â\n\nFor those intrigued by the immense potential of a clear, well-structured data ecosystem, the opportunity to be part of this evolving field is within reach.

      "# [Data Migration Testing: The Case Against Manual Data Validation](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-migration-testing)\nThe amount of data produced on a daily basis is staggering. But all the data in the world doesnât do much good if it canât flow between systems, applications, and infrastructures. This is why the process of data migration is mission-critical for data-driven organizationsâand data migration testing, doubly so.\n\nBut to understand why, we must first define what data migration testing is, what makes it more important than ever, why manual testing just canât cut it anymore, and how automation alone may not be enough to keep data-driven organizations in business.\n\nWhat is data migration testing?\n\nData migration testing is a critical process that ensures the successful transfer of different types of data from one system to another. Use cases that benefit from this testing range from simple (ensuring the success of a basic database migration) to complicated (transferring data from a legacy system to modern systems that are compatible with new applications).\n\nIn modern data environments, anything that can go wrong usually tries to. So the process of data migration testing is essential for maintaining data integrity, minimizing disruptions, and ensuring that functional and non-functional requirements are all met when the migration itself is complete.\n\nAs such, data migration testing typically involves three main testing phases:\n\n1. Pre-migration testing: Before the process begins, the testing team aligns on the scope of data that will be moved, performing data mapping between where the data currently resides and its target location. This phase is vital for understanding the data schema of the new system in play, as it allows the team to identify risks and create contingency plans as part of a clear migration plan and strategy.\n\n2. Migration testing: As the digital journey begins, the testing team will monitor the process in real timeâsampling and validating the data as it migrates while testing the integration of the target system with other systems. Doing so ensures the data is transferred correctly and any discrepancies are identified.\n\n3. Post-migration testing: Once the migration is complete, the team will compare the data in the target system to its source, confirming that everything has transferred correctly and that optimal data quality was maintained. Additionally, post-migration testing often involves data reconciliation and testing the functionality, performance, and documentation of the system the data migrated to.\n\nThe overall process will utilize a combination of white-box and black-box testing methodologies. At their most basic, white-box testing ensures that the migration logic is correctly implemented, while black-box testing verifies that the migration meets the functional and business requirements. Both are essential aspects of a testing teamâs comprehensive data migration testing strategy.\n\nWhy data migration testing is more important than ever\n\nAs more business organizations aspire to be data-driven, more data is created. And all of that data has to migrateâacross systems, departments, organizations, and continents. No wonder, then, that data migration testing is becoming mission-critical for modern organizations. And this involves several specific challenges.\n\nIn addition to its ever-increasing volume, the data itself is becoming more complicated. New technologies are emerging. Organizations continue to merge or acquire other companies. Companies themselves are constantly updating and optimizing existing systems. This all creates a dynamic, turbulent landscape that data migration needs to navigate while testing teams work to make sure data losses or corruption donât occur along the way.\n\nThe rules required to navigate this landscape are growing more complex as well. Stringent data protection regulations, like Europeâs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), have increasingly global implications as the infrastructure connecting individuals and businesses around the world grows more sophisticated. Data migration testing processes now help verify that migrated data adheres to these regulations, helping to minimize the risk of non-compliance and potential (very expensive) legal penalties.\n\nOther complications stem from digital transformation initiatives as organizations migrate data to new applications in order to utilize advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning capabilities. Migration testing is also critical as the digital transformation process takes place. Without testing, these initiatives could easily result in disruptions to business operations or irreparable damage to organizational data quality, undermining the desired effects of the initiative itself.\n\nSimilarly, the infrastructures that enable organizations to be data-driven require frequent system upgrades and the ongoing integration of disparate systems. Teams use data migration testing to ensure system compatibility and a seamless flow of data across the organizationâs technological ecosystem. This supports the efficient operations, strategic initiatives, and data integrity that being data-driven requires.\n\nGiven these compounding complications, data migration testing is quickly becoming more than just another tool in the data team toolbox. Businesses are embracing migration testing as a critical component of modern organizational strategyâsupporting operational excellence, compliance, and strategic decision-making, all of which are essential for staying competitive in today's whipsawing data-driven business environment.\n\nChecking the boxes with data migration testing\n\nWhile data migration testing is employed to help with an increasing variety of data-related issues and concerns, the process used in a testing environment tends to be fairly consistent.\n\nAs part of a data migration testing strategy, these steps can be followed in the form of a checklist:\n\n1. Planning for the pre-migration phase\n\nObjective definition: Always clarify the goals of each data migration, identifying any needs specific to data consolidation, potential system upgrades, or cloud migration, for instance. All relevant stakeholders should be engaged while objectives are being defined. This ensures all business needs are captured and will be accounted for.\n\nSource data analysis: Utilize data profiling tools to assess the quality, volume, and structure of the data that will be migrated.\n\nData cleansing strategy: Plan for deduplication, normalization, and correction of any source data anomalies.\n\nData mapping: Employ data mapping tools to outline field-level transformations and ensure alignment with the target schema. To mitigate risks of misinterpretation or oversight, consider conducting an iterative review and validation of your mapping logic with stakeholders engaged while defining migration objectives.\n\nEstablish KPIs: Define specific, measurable outcomes and related metrics for data quality, migration time, and post-migration system performance.\n\nBackup verification: Once pre-migration planning is complete, implement checksums or hash totals that can be used to verify the completeness and integrity of the backup data.\n\n2. Testing environment setup\n\nProduction environment replication: Use virtualization or cloud environments to mirror the production setup closely.\n\nIsolation measures: Ensure network and access configurations prevent any interference with live environments.\n\nPlan for updates: Consider establishing a process for regularly syncing the test environment with production updates. Doing so reduces risks associated with environmental drift, as testing will always be conducted on the most current setup.\n\n3. Data migration tool configuration\n\nTool selection: Choose migration tools based on compatibility with source and target systems and overall data complexity.\n\nParameter configuration: Set up conversion rules, connection strings, and error handling procedures.\n\n4. Perform a trial migration\n\nPilot testing: Select a representative data subset for trial migrations to identify patterns of errors or issues.\n\nTest iteration: In some cases, iterative trial migrationsâincreasing volumes of data over timeâcan help teams understand performance impacts and potential bottlenecks at scale. Establishing specific criteria or thresholds for escalating trial migration volumes can ensure these testing phases are systematic and controlled.\n\n5. Execute the data migration\n\nReal-time monitoring: Employ monitoring tools to track the migration process, focusing on error rates, throughput, and performance metrics.\n\nPreemptive planning: By establishing a rollback or remediation plan, teams can be prepared if unforeseen and significant issues (e.g., data loss or corruption, performance degradation) arise during the migration process.\n\n6. Implement post-migration testing\n\nData integrity and quality checks: Apply SQL queries or scripts to compare source and target datasets for discrepancies. Implement automated data quality tools to assess data accuracy, validity, and consistency post-migration.\n\nData verification and functional testing: Use data verification tools for checksums, record counts, and spot-checking. Conduct end-to-end testing of business processes using the migrated data.\n\nPerformance testing: Leverage performance testing tools to simulate user load and measure response times, throughput, and resource utilization.\n\nSecurity and compliance testing: Utilize data security scanning tools to detect vulnerabilities and ensure encryption, access controls, and audit trails meet compliance standards.\n\nHistorical data validation: It can be advantageous to also make sure historical data remains accurate and accessible once the migration process is completeâespecially with regard to reporting and compliance.\n\n7. Conduct a stakeholder review\n\nReview meetings: Organize sessions with IT, business stakeholders, and data users to validate the migration outcomes against objectives. Push for formal acceptance testing conducted by business users to ensure the migrated data will function and support business needs as expected.\n\n8. Perform finalization and cleanup\n\nData reconciliation: Ensure any data changes in the source system during migration are captured and migrated to the target system.\n\nPreservation: Archiving or securely disposing of old data and decommissioning legacy systems can help address post-migration data hygiene and security considerations.\n\n9. Prioritize documentation and reporting\n\nTechnical documentation: Detail the technical aspects of the migration, including data mappings, transformations, and tool configurations. Consider the value of also recording why certain decisions were made in addition to the specifics of what was done, as this can enhance the value of the documentation overall.\n\nLessons learned: Document challenges, solutions, and insights gained for continuous improvement in future migrations. If available, incorporate information and insights gained during the process to an organizational knowledge base to benefit future migrations and overall organization efficiency.\n\n10. Establish post-migration support\n\nIssue tracking system: Establish a mechanism for reporting, tracking, and resolving any post-migration issues.\n\nInvest in migratory success: Whenever possible, a dedicated support team should be established for a defined period post-migration to assist with user queries and issues as data consumers adapt to the new system.\n\nManual migration testing in the modern world: An unnecessary evil\n\nNow that weâve stepped out a fairly comprehensive, phase-based approach to data migration testing, letâs go ahead and poke the elephant in the room: Manual data migration testing.\n\nLike many trends in software development and IT operations, manual data migration testing was once a labor-intensive process. It still is. However, while manual testing may be leveraged in specific or niche situations (e.g., for custom applications or small-scale migrations), it is and should be eschewed for increasingly potent automated processes and tools.\n\nTo clarify, handling data migration testing manually in increasingly complex and dynamic IT environments introduces several challenges and problems, primarily due to the scale, complexity, and critical nature of the data involved. The manifesting of issues related to manual manual testing processes typically include the following:\n\nResource intensiveness: Manual testing, especially for large datasets, is extremely time-consuming. Each test has to be designed, executed, and verified manually, which slows down the migration timeline significantly. This necessitates skilled personnel spending considerable amounts of time on repetitive tasks, as opposed to higher-value, strategic activities.\n\nHuman error: No one is perfect. So, naturally, manual data migration testing is prone to errors. Intelligent, experienced, well-meaning personnel handling data verification, validation, and comparison can suffer from oversights, inaccuracies, and inconsistencies. This is especially true when dealing with complex data structures and/or large volumes of data.\n\nLimited scalability: As noted before, the volume of data pumping through the hearts of modern organizations is immense. Manual testing processes donât scale well, as the time and resources they require increase exponentially.\n\nDifficulties in replicating tests: Replication is a vital aspect of comprehensive data testing. When utilizing a manual process, it becomes difficult to conduct and standardize testing efforts across different datasets or migration projects. This lack of standardization, in turn, can lead to variability in testing quality and outcomes.\n\nInadequate coverage: Given the noted resource and time constraints, manual testing often results in insufficient coverage of data and scenarios. In these cases, critical data issues might go undetected because not all cases or data variations can be thoroughly tested.\n\nLack of real-time monitoring: Manual testing processes lack the capability for real-time monitoring and alerting for issues that occur during the migration. Immediate issue detection is critical for avoiding downtime, security issues, and degradation of operational efficiency.\n\nData validation complexity: Validating the accuracy of complex data transformations, relationships, and integrations manually is challenging. Ensuring data integrity and consistency across different systems without automated tools can be nearly impossible for intricate datasets.\n\nInconsistent documentation: Manual testing processes often suffer from inadequate documentation of tests and outcomes, which can hinder troubleshooting, compliance auditing, and future migration efforts.\n\nDelays in feedback: Finally, the comparatively slow nature of manual testing leads to delayed feedback to the development or migration teams. This can extend the duration of migration projects as issues may only be identified late in the process, necessitating rework.\n\nAmplifying data migration testing at scale\n\nData contracts can play a significant role in mitigating or minimizing the potential downsides and complications associated with automated data migration testing using ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools. Here's how data contracts can address some of the challenges:\n\nStandardization and compatibility\n\nData contracts define the structure, format, and other specifications of the data to be migrated, ensuring that all parties involved in the migration process have a clear understanding of the data requirements. This standardization can help prevent data mismatches and compatibility issues between legacy and new systems, which are common challenges in data migration.\n\nData quality and preparation\n\nBy specifying the quality and format of data required for migration, data contracts can help ensure that data is cleaned and prepared before the migration process begins. This proactive approach to data quality can reduce the need for manual intervention to rectify data quality issues, which is a significant advantage when using automated ETL tools.\n\nEfficiency and speed\n\nData contracts can streamline the migration process by clearly defining the data elements and transformations required, allowing for more efficient mapping and processing by ETL tools. This clarity can reduce the time and effort required for initial setup and customization of ETL tools, addressing one of the key considerations when relying on automation for data migration testing.\n\nError checking and debugging\n\nWith clear data contracts in place, automated ETL tools can more effectively perform error checking and debugging. The specifications outlined in data contracts can serve as a benchmark for validating the migrated data, making it easier to identify and resolve issues quickly. This can enhance the reliability of the migration process and reduce the risk of data loss or corruption.\n\nCost considerations\n\nWhile the cost of licensing advanced ETL tools and the need for skilled personnel to operate them can be prohibitive, data contracts can help optimize the use of these tools. By clearly defining the scope and requirements of the migration, data contracts can help ensure that resources are used efficiently, potentially reducing the overall cost of the migration project.\n\nBalancing automation with manual oversight\n\nData contracts support a hybrid approach to data migration testing by delineating areas where automation is most beneficial and where manual oversight is necessary. For instance, they can specify scenarios that require human judgment or domain expertise, ensuring that the strengths of both manual and automated testing are leveraged effectively.\n\nIn short, data contracts serve as a foundational element in the data migration process, providing clear guidelines and specifications that can address many of the challenges associated with using automated ETL tools. By facilitating standardization, improving data quality, enhancing efficiency, and supporting error resolution, data contracts can significantly mitigate the potential downsides of relying solely on automation for data migration testing.\n\nAutomated data migration testing is ideal, but with a data contract? It can be exceptional.\n\nAs the challenges of Big Data continue to compound, automation alone may not be enough for some organizations. Thatâs why adopting data contracts is a smart way to ensure automated data migration testing can outpace demand.\n\nData contracts, well-drafted and enforced, are the optimal means to maintain this paceâdefining the structure, format, and other specifications of the data to be migrated, ensuring that all parties involved in the migration process have a clear understanding of the data requirements.",

Most of the features aren’t build yet and I will definitely need to delegate some stuff to a hire or two while I build alongside them. I am in no need to raise an absurd amount of money but I just want to know where and how can I raise 50k or more to address my micro-rapid growth trajectory atm.  \n\nEdit: if I must raise more money, then how does one simply raise 2-3 million in this current venture market lol \n\n## Comment ID l6yaaes with +85 score by [(Rathogawd, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l6yaaes/) (in reply to ID 1d7bqx2):\n50k is a loan from family/friends, self, or bank.\n\n### Comment ID l6z52ha with +4 score by [(AtlasShrged, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l6z52ha/) (in reply to ID l6yaaes):\nthis is the way\n\n### Comment ID l7b7ado with +3 score by [(Ironfour_ZeroLP, Reddit, 2024-06-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l7b7ado/) (in reply to ID l6yaaes):\nAlso presales! \n\nIf OP has that much traction with users, they can ask users to put early money toward the product. It also helps validate the need - if some users are willing to pay and others are not, that is a strong signal on priority of features.\n\n### Comment ID l7hlr5s with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-06-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l7hlr5s/) (in reply to ID l6yaaes):\n[removed]\n\n#### Comment ID l7igtqv with +1 score by [(Rathogawd, Reddit, 2024-06-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l7igtqv/) (in reply to ID l7hlr5s):\nTrue. And not everyone can get VC backing and you won't for just 50k. The ways I listed are the best ways to fund your project if what you are looking for is only 50k. Kickstarter, GoFundMe, etc. are also available but not nearly as reliable as what I listed.\n\n## Comment ID l6y98bc with +41 score by [(207207, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l6y98bc/) (in reply to ID 1d7bqx2):\nIf you need to raise money from VC, 50k isn’t enough. Believe it or not, you need to have a viable and believable plan to use 2-3M for someone to invest.\n\n“That seems counterintuitive! Why would someone want to give me MORE money?”\n\nHaving more cash on hand (in competent hands where there’s a plan to put that money to use) actually derisks the investment. 50k in a company means there’s zero margin for error. If you don’t deliver or make a mistake, that 50k is gone. With 2-3M, you have longer runway to deliver, make mistakes, etc. You also have a budget for marketing and acquiring users, hiring a team, etc, all of which is important. Without that, and only investing 50k, you might have a product but you have no path to finding anyone to use/buy your product, and someone has bet on just one persons ability for deliver it all.\n\n## Comment ID l6y7q7a with +42 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l6y7q7a/) (in reply to ID 1d7bqx2):\n[removed]\n\n### Comment ID l6z6dos with +7 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l6z6dos/) (in reply to ID l6y7q7a):\ni had angels offer 10-20 each. but only after many months of work\n\n#### Comment ID l6zqy8i with +6 score by [(TriggernometryPhD, Reddit, 2024-06-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l6zqy8i/) (in reply to ID l6z6dos):\nThe juice is not worth the squeeze.\n\n## Comment ID l6z04ml with +10 score by [(DancinWithWolves, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l6z04ml/) (in reply to ID 1d7bqx2):\nDepending on your area, you should be able to find a local network of angel investors. If you can get in front of them, you may be able to convince them to do a tiny pre seed round of $50k or $100k. \n\nVCs aren’t the only option here, everyone saying you can’t raise $50k aside from family has no hustle.\n\n## Comment ID l6y81e1 with +5 score by [(Late_Republic_7923, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l6y81e1/) (in reply to ID 1d7bqx2):\nHey.

Are the users requesting these features sticking around, or are you thinking they'll start sticking around after you implement the feature? Are they paying customers and, if so, what's the annual customer value?\n\nTons of feature requests coming from users paying $2k/month and continuing to use the product is awesome. Tons of feature requests coming from free users looking at the app and saying \"I'd need X to use this\" is basically worthless: you can implement most of those features and there's a good chance those users likely still won't be willing to pay.\n\nIf you have paying customers and are making $5k-$10k/month, you can likely raise money from something like the Calm Fund or TinySeed even if you aren't seeking venture scale returns. Otherwise, your best bet is angel networks or friends + family.\n\n## Comment ID l6yihwz with +6 score by [(Various_Cabinet_5071, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l6yihwz/) (in reply to ID 1d7bqx2):\nNvidia calls\n\n### Comment ID l6yk3nf with +1 score by [(APIsoup, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l6yk3nf/) (in reply to ID l6yihwz):\nBest answer so far\n\n#### Comment ID l6zlwwi with +1 score by [(Various_Cabinet_5071, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l6zlwwi/) (in reply to ID l6yk3nf):\nUnironically, you'll prob raise the desired $3 mil by August with properly managed Nvidia options.

It comes with many, MANY strings attached. And it’s mostly a one-way door, you can’t (easily) undo it (context: speaking from personal experience - I raised $15M for my first startup, acquired in 2021).\n\nAside from the other possible funding sources that others have mentioned, if you do make the decision to raise from VCs, then asking for 50K is an order of magnitude (or two) off. Either raise a 500K SAFE, or go for a full priced round and ask for a few million.\n\nAgain, this all depends on what sort of traction you actually have.\n\n## Comment ID l6y9d7w with +1 score by [(there-you-run, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l6y9d7w/) (in reply to ID 1d7bqx2):\nFriends and Family.\n\n## Comment ID l6zd07n with +1 score by [(lets-make-deals, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l6zd07n/) (in reply to ID 1d7bqx2):\nAngel Investors $10k - $750k ...

In other words, VCs need to make bets on companies where 1) the company has enough potential to be worth in the billions, and 2) the VC firm has enough invested where they won't be too diluted when (if) that exit event happens.\n\nFor perspective, the startup I joined as the first employee raised a $7M seed round. $50k checks would come from angel investors to fill out the round and bring on advisors.\n\nLike others said, potentially work with a bank or do a family and friends round. The fact that you have too many users should make this pitch easier.\n\n### Comment ID l73c7lj with +1 score by [(PM_ME_YOUR_ANUS_PIC, Reddit, 2024-06-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l73c7lj/) (in reply to ID l6zp67a):\nHow did they go about raising 7M as a seed round?

The founders built up demand through content to validate the problem, did 300+ user interviews with leaders in the industry, built the technology at a previous company, then turned that into a community with 8K+ people. In that community, they built up a list of first round design partners to help build out the solution. They did this for a year, just validating the problem and idea, which they were able to go to VCs and raise a round. This is why I was okay being employee one, and even quit my job to join before they officially raised. I saw they had the ingredients to build an amazing product in a market with a high TAM.\n\nHere is the company: https://venturebeat.com/ai/with-github-for-data-gable-ai-wants-to-connect-software-engineers-and-ml-developers/\n\n## Comment ID l70drke with +1 score by [(sugarnotnice, Reddit, 2024-06-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l70drke/) (in reply to ID 1d7bqx2):\nAngels 😇😇😇😇\n\n## Comment ID l70l07g with +1 score by [(Moredream, Reddit, 2024-06-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1d7bqx2/how_does_one_simply_raise_50k_in_this_current_vc/l70l07g/) (in reply to ID 1d7bqx2):\nraising money and spending money are totally different, no matter how much you raise if you spend too much you gonna die. so why do you need that much or how to spend it is more important. if you can, without funding  might be better haha. some idiots spend all to their salaries and died because they failed the next rounds.

Than they investe in the competence of the team. Then they check what master-plan you have to conquer the market. Than you need a business plan from a minimum of 150.000k for a pre-seed, to a 1M for a seed. This is what you should aim if you want a VC. \n\nAnother way is to find mentors/angels to give you the chip you need!

Its users link content created elsewhere, effectively siphoning value from  \nother sources via its users.\n2. Its users create new content specifically for it, thus profiting of off the  \nfree labour and content made by its users\n\nThis means that Reddit creates no value but exploits its users to generate the  \nvalue that uses to sell advertisements, charge its users for meaningless tokens,  \nsell NFTs, and seek private investment. Reddit relies on volunteer moderation by  \npeople who receive no benefit, not thanks, and definitely no pay. Reddit is  \nprofiting entirely off all of its users doing all of the work from gathering  \nlinks, to making comments, to moderating everything, all for free. Reddit is\nalso going to sell your information, you data, your content to third party AI\ncompanies so that they can train their models on your work, your life, your\ncontent and Reddit can make money from it, all while you see nothing in return.\n\n## Lack of respect for its third party developers\n\nI'm sure everyone at this point is familiar with the API changes putting many  \nthird party application developers out of business. Reddit saw how much money  \nentities like OpenAI and other data scraping firms are making and wants a slice  \nof that pie, and doesn't care who it tramples on in the process. Third party  \ndevelopers have created tools that make the use of Reddit far more appealing and  \nfeasible for so many people, again freely creating value for the company, and  \nit doesn't care that it's killing off these initiatives in order to take some of  \nthe profits it thinks it's entitled to.\n\n## Lack of respect for other cultures\n\nReddit spreads and enforces right wing, libertarian, US values, morals, and  \nethics, forcing other cultures to abandon their own values and adopt American  \nones if they wish to provide free labour and content to a for profit American  \ncorporation. American cultural hegemony is ever present and only made worse by  \ncompanies like Reddit actively forcing their values and social mores upon  \nforeign cultures without any sensitivity or care for local values and customs.  \nMeanwhile they allow reprehensible ideologies to spread through their network  \nunchecked because, while other nations might make such hate and bigotry illegal,  \nReddit holds \"Free Speech\" in the highest regard, but only so long as it doesn't  \noffend their own American sensibilities.\n\n## Lack for respect for the truth\n\nReddit has long been associated with disinformation, conspiracy theories,  \nastroturfing, and many such targeted attacks against the truth. Again protected  \nunder a veil of \"Free Speech\", these harmful lies spread far and wide using  \nReddit as a base. Reddit allows whole deranged communities and power-mad  \nmoderators to enforce their own twisted world-views, allowing them to silence  \ndissenting voices who oppose the radical, and often bigoted, vitriol spewed by  \nthose who fear leaving their own bubbles of conformity and isolation.\n\n## Lack of respect for common decency\n\nReddit is full of hate and bigotry. Many subreddits contain casual exclusion,  \ndiscrimination, insults, homophobia, transphobia, racism, anti-semitism,  \ncolonialism, imperialism, American exceptionalism, and just general edgy hatred.  \nReddit is toxic, it creates, incentivises, and profits off of \"engagement\" and  \n\"high arousal emotions\" which is a polite way of saying \"shouting matches\" and  \n\"fear and hatred\".\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf not for ideological reasons then at least leave Reddit for personal ones. Do  \nYou enjoy endlessly scrolling Reddit? Does constantly refreshing your feed bring  \nyou any joy or pleasure? Does getting into meaningless internet arguments with  \nstrangers on the internet improve your life? Quit Reddit, if only for a few  \nweeks, and see if it improves your life.\n\nI am leaving Reddit for good.

The localization leaves them incestually ambiguous) at the heart of the world, where it would naturally be attracted due to all the life force gathered there.\n\nThe gang kicks its ass with Ashley's Lord Blazer powers, and then through the power of friendship they kick Blazer's ass as well.\n\n### Comment ID gtjcob2 with +5 score by [(reyinpoetic, Reddit, 2021-04-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildarms/comments/mkvhpi/finally_finished_wild_arms_2_but_i_have_some/gtjcob2/) (in reply to ID gtimp86):\nYeah, the incest isn't so much implied as stated outright.  Irving wanted the child who became the vessel for the Kuiper Belt to be double-extra descended from the Sword Magess, thus the incest.\n\nAnd, while no less abstract, it wasn't the Power of Friendship™ that defeated Lord Blazer, but the combined societal inspiration across Filgaia, focused on Ashley.  In the past, Anastasia had to stand alone and died because nobody believed than anyone but her could fight Lord Blazer.  Now, everyone knows they don't have to rely on 'heroes,' and lends that power to Ashley.\n\nIt's not exactly concrete, but it's more in keeping with the themes of the game.\n\n#### Comment ID gtjfidm with +3 score by [(JokerReach, Reddit, 2021-04-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildarms/comments/mkvhpi/finally_finished_wild_arms_2_but_i_have_some/gtjfidm/) (in reply to ID gtjcob2):\nNice correction on the first point--thanks!\n\nAnd on the second point maybe it's a bit of a stretch, but I think that this situation can still fall under the Power of Friendship trope.\n\n### Comment ID hry0xu7 with +2 score by [(skyliet, Reddit, 2022-01-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildarms/comments/mkvhpi/finally_finished_wild_arms_2_but_i_have_some/hry0xu7/) (in reply to ID gtimp86):\nI just realized after I played the game in my childhood ... that Kuiper Belt is likely an analog to Cthulhu or even Yog-Shototh/Azathoth, being an incomprehensible and abstract cosmic horror.\n\n## Comment ID gtjnbdp with +7 score by [(reyinpoetic, Reddit, 2021-04-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildarms/comments/mkvhpi/finally_finished_wild_arms_2_but_i_have_some/gtjnbdp/) (in reply to ID mkvhpi):\nOkay, let me toss my hat in the ring, here.\n\nLong ago, the Sword Magess, Anastasia Valeria stood as a lone **Hero** against Lord Blazer, a sort of sentient apocalypse.  Her only friend was Marivel, the last of the vampiric Crimson Nobles.  Anastasia fought alone, however, and died for the sake of everyone in the world, sealing Lord Blazer away into the far future.\n\nOver time, Anastasia's descendants would become known as those with **Hero**ic blood.  Some would become nobles through this reputation, such as Irving Vold Valeria.  Others would cling to that **Hero**ic reputation, even as they dredged through the gutters, such as Aisha Bernadette.\n\nIrving was well connected, and skilled in academics, magic, and despite his crippled legs, combat.  It was at the Sielije observatory that Irving first noticed an inconsistency in the sky.  A stain starting to form.  Another universe beginning to devour Filgaia.  However, he knew that bringing this situation to the attention of the nations of the world would only worsen the divides that existed between them, and make Filgaia weaker than ever against this new threat.  Irving knew that he had to create a tangible threat for Filgaia to unite against.  Or a threat that could bring all of Filgaia to heel.\n\nFive years ago, the Slayheim Liberation Army fight a coup d'etat against the Slayheim royal family, under the leadership of Vinsfeld Rhadamanthus, and fronted by the **Hero** of Slayheim, Brad Evans.  They won, but the royal family weren't willing to lose.  They detonated the Angel Halo, a superweapon that rendered the entirety of Slayheim a barren salt waste, with only undead husks remaining of their people.  Brad Evans was captured far south of Slayheim.  Vinsfeld went missing.\n\nDuring the five years Brad wasted away in Illsveil Prison, Irving contacted Vinsfeld, offering him considerable funding to lead a terror organization, Odessa.\n\nAt the same time, the kingdom of Meria Boule was forming ARMS, the Agile Remote Mission Squad, a platoon of musketeers who would mobilize against the increasing monster threat in Merian territories.  However, Odessa chose to, or rather was instructed to strike at ARMS's formation ceremony.\n\nCaina, one of Vinsfeld's lieutenants, was a specialist at summoning magic, and opened a demon gate in the Sword Cathedral, a shrine to the Sword Magess, and where all the ARMS Musketeers were.  All the Musketeers are possessed by Protoblazer demons, and died.\n\nAll but one.  Ashley Winchester, a Musketeer unremarkable except for his reckless **hero**ic steak, was possessed by Lord Blazer itself, let back into the world by Caina's Demon Summoning.  It was only through the calling of Anastasia's sword, the Argetlahm, that Ashley was able to suppress Lord Blazer with the power of Blazer's old enemy.\n\nLater, after sleeping off the injuries he'd sustained, Ashley found a young girl outside the bakery he lives in.  The young girl was Lilka Eleniak, younger sister to the famed Eleniak Witch-girl, whom Lilka looked up to as her **Hero**.  However, due to a research accident, the elder Eleniak was, for lack of a better term, gone.  Lilka had recieved a letter summoning the Eleniak Witch-girl to the home of Irving Vold Valeria, and had traveled from her home in Sielije to Meria Boule in her sister's stead.\n\nIrving had left a similar summons with Marina, Ashley's childhood friend and romantic interest, and so it was in both his and Lilka's interest that they travel together to the Valeria Chateau.\n\nOnce there, Irving informed the two that he intended to reform ARMS as a smaller force, to be mobilized anywhere in the world, against any threats.  This would soon ring hollow, however, as Irving would use Ashley's weapon to frame him for attempted murder, and have Ashley sent to Illsveil Prison, with Lilka escorting him.\n\nAshley was not in prison long before a mass escape occurred, caused by Judecca, another of Vinsfeld's lieutenants, as a rapid recruitment drive for Odessa's footsoldiers.  This allowed Ashley to escape and for her and Lilka to encounter the only prisoner who did not take the opportunity to run: Brad Evans.  Brad would join them, and was puzzled upon finding out that his release was arranged by Irving, who had selected Brad for membership in ARMS before framing Ashley.\n\nDuring one of their first assignments, the newly-formed ARMS would uncover a global communications hijacking by Odessa, where they declared their intentions: to forcibly unite all of Filgaia under their banner, as the \"**Hero**es\" against the corruption of the world governments.\n\nARMS and Odessa would continue to fight each other, with the threat of Odessa being the catalyst for other world nations giving ARMS jurisdiction within their borders.  Along the way, ARMS would gain as members Tim Rhymeless, a young shaman of the Baskar Tribe, and Kanon, otherwise known as Aisha Bernadette, who had replaced most of her body with cybernetics to pursue her **hero**ic lineage as a bounty hunter, and who pursued the spirit of Lord Blazer within Ashley.  Additionally, a mysterious engineer named Marivel would attach herself to ARMS, claiming to know Ashley.\n\nAdditionally, that same spirit had manifested within Ashley as the formidable KnightBlazer, a ghoulish demonic warrior of charred blood and torn flesh, whose every action took all of Ashley's willpower to reign in.\n\nAdditionally, the remaining of Vinsfeld's lieutenants were encountered.  Ptolomea, who was honorable and a **hero** to his men, and Antenora, who sought revenge against Vinsfeld for killing her family, by making Vinsfeld fall in love with her.  (It is possible that Antenora was the daughter of Slayheim nobles, or possibly the princess of Slayheim, but it's not confirmed in either language.)\n\nTim is tasked with contacting the Guardians, the spirit-gods of Filgaia, for aid against Odessa, but in order to do so, he is supposed to be sacrificed, giving his life to become a **hero**.  He rejects this, however, and chooses to become a living link to the Guardians.\n\nAfter many encounters, Odessa has commandeered the ancient sky fortress Heimdall Gazzo, and is threatening the now-united nations of Filgaia with its munitions.  ARMS disables the Gazzo's surface-based support towers, the Diablo Pillars, killing Ptolomea, driving Judecca to suicide, forcing Caina to default on a bargain with a spirit and being taken to another dimension, and killing Antenora, which fulfilled her vengeance plot against Vinsfeld.\n\nARMS stormed the Gazzo and slew Vinsfeld, ending the threat of Odessa.  However, much like his foes at Slayheim, Vinsfeld couldn't stand to lose, and tried to strand ARMS in space.  All of ARMS got to the escape pods, except for Ashley, who was lost in low-orbit, protected only by the spirit of Anastasia, the Sword Magess.\n\n### Comment ID gtjnbqm with +7 score by [(reyinpoetic, Reddit, 2021-04-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildarms/comments/mkvhpi/finally_finished_wild_arms_2_but_i_have_some/gtjnbqm/) (in reply to ID gtjnbdp):\nAshley awoke in the Maze of Memory, a crystallized nexus of Anastasia's lifetime, where Marivel first met Ashley.  Exploring this Maze, Ashley learned that the great **Hero**, the Sword Magess, was just a scared girl, who cared too much not to fight for the future if the world.  Anastasia never wanted to be a **hero**.  She never saw herself as a **hero**.  She wanted to live her normal, happy life, but instead she died a **hero**.\n\nLearning this of the vaunted Sword Magess resonates with Ashley, who until now had been on the same track of self-sacrifice as Anastasia, but found himself increasingly wishing for a normal life.\n\nAt the end of the Memory Maze, and the end of Anastasia's life, Anastasia gave Ashley sisterly advice, and sent Lucied, the Guardian of Desire and her constant companion, to help Ashley.\n\nAshley willed himself to return to Filgaia, and emerged in the Sword Cathedral, the place where he and Anastasia's spirit had first met.\n\nARMS was reunited, and just in time, as Odessa's remains had to be dealt with, and the Encroaching Parallel Universe Irving had seen long ago was now an obvious threat.  It had been responsible for the increase in monster numbers that had been plaguing Filgaia, and now it has blotted out the sky.\n\nA recent encounter with the Draconic Nuclear Weapon, Grauswein, had educated ARMS about the immense power that the bio-mechanical Dragons could offer, and seeking one out was the obvious course of action to combat the other universe attacking their own.  They beseeched Lombardia for aid, but the dragon we resigned to death, for she had seen this happen before, to her own home universe.  The Encroaching Parallel Universe, Kuiper Belt, had devoured her home, and the dragons had fled to Filgaia, hoping to escape, but inadvertently led Kuiper Belt to Filgaia.  All but Lombardia had died off, their mechanical bodies harvested for Filgaian technology.\n\nARMS were able to convince Lombardia to fight, however, and she lent her wings to ARMS.\n\nARMS were now faced with the cruel realty of their situation.  The thing they were fighting was not a man or a creature.  It was not even a location, but an entire universe.  They could not even hope to exist in the way they would need to to interact with the Kuiper Belt.  But Irving had an idea.  An idea that would require power.  A world's power.\n\nThe four Raypoints, Earth, Wing, Flame, and Muse were challenging, both to ARMS as a whole, and to it's members.  Brad confronted truths about his past as firm as the earth.  Tim confronted the choice he had made, as free as the wind.  Lilka overcame her inferiority complex, allowing herself to burn bright as a flame.  And Kanon reconciled with her past self, letting Aisha pour back into Kanon like water.\n\nWith the Raypoints freed, Filgaia's own mana flowed free, and Irving's plan could be put to action.  Just as Lord Blazer was a living apocalypse contained within Ashley's living body, so too, Irving believed, could the Kuiper Belt be contained within a mortal shell.  ARMS would traverse the exterior of the great mana prison, the Trapezohedron, and slew a larva that had manifested on it.\n\nHowever, that was but the smallest fragment of the Kuiper Belt.  The plan was a failure.  Their only option for now was to rest, and deal with the last known leftovers of Odessa: the wreckage of the Heimdall Gazzo.\n\nIt was at the Gazzo, in a surging data fragment, that ARMS found out the horrible truth.  Irving had orchestrated everything, from the formation of the original doomed ARMS squad and Odessa's formation, through the diplomatic appliances of desperation.  Whether Odessa won or lost, it meant a united Filgaia against the Kuiper Belt.\n\nIt was as ARMS learned these truths that Irving put his final, desperate plan into action.  He impregnated his twin sister Altaecia, and they both vanished from the Chateau, leaving only a note for ARMS to follow them to the Spiral Tower, the center of Filgaia, and access point to Glaive le Gable, Guardian of the primordial Mud.\n\nAshley and Marina consummated their love.\n\nLilka resolved to return to her classes.\n\nBrad spent time with a comatose friend of his from the Slayheim War: the true Brad Evans, whose name the ARMS member had taken to keep the **Hero**'s name going.  His true name, and the name that the wheelchair-bound veteran now held, was Billy Pidler.\n\nTim entered a relationship with a girl from his birthtown, Colette.\n\nKanon came to the realization that **hero**ism is performed, not inherited through blood.\n\nAnd Marivel, who may or may not have joined the ARMS squad, found companionship in her immortal life in an orphan boy.\n\nThen, they set out.\n\nAt the bottom of the Spiral Tower, in the depths of the massive Guardian of Mud, ARMS found Irving and Altaecia.  Irving apologized to ARMS, but held firm that he wanted to fight alongside them, as an equal, despite his crippled legs.  He desired nothing so much as to be a **hero**.  And so he and his sister created a new life, an empty shell, and brought it to the focus point of all life in Filgaia, for the Kuiper Belt to occupy, just as Lord Blazer occupied Ashley.  The Kuiper Belt entered the new life, and Irving and Altaecia were consumed by the creation of a Living Universe \n\nThe fight was desperate.  ARMS were spread thin, and could only hold on.  But the Encroaching Parallel Universe was slain, once and for all.  All was well.\n\nExcept that the demon inside Ashley had been biding it's time, waiting for the right time to emerge and consume the world in flames once more.  Ashley was tired, weakened from the fight against the Kuiper Belt.  Now was the time.\n\nBut Lord Blazer was not the only one prepared for this moment.  The Argetlahm, which had dwelled within Ashley ever since the Sword Cathedral, lent Ashley the resilience of Anastasia, and let him fight the demon.\n\nThere was one big difference between Anastasia and Ashley, however.  Anastasia was the **hero** when everyone needed one.  ARMS had inspired and united all of Filgaia to stand and fight for themselves, to desire a world that doesn't need a **hero**.  That desire empowered Ashley to destroy Lord Blazer utterly.\n\nA year later, a year into the new peace, all of ARMS meet again.  They discuss how it was not a **hero** who saved the world, but everybody.  Ashley and Marina introduce their children.  Twins, a boy and girl.  Lilka asks their names.  The names are never said, but Marina comments that they are the most wonderful names in Filgaia, and Ashley tells the others to protect them, even if they get lost on their way.\n\n\"We're never alone, right?  Right?  I'm not a \"hero\".  The protagonist of this endless tale is...\"\n\nThe End\n\n#### Comment ID gtkk5zu with +3 score by [(Purest_Prodigy, Reddit, 2021-04-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildarms/comments/mkvhpi/finally_finished_wild_arms_2_but_i_have_some/gtkk5zu/) (in reply to ID gtjnbqm):\nhero\n\n#### Comment ID h509njd with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-07-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildarms/comments/mkvhpi/finally_finished_wild_arms_2_but_i_have_some/h509njd/) (in reply to ID gtjnbqm):\n> Brad spent time with a comatose friend of his from the Slayheim War: the true Brad Evans, whose name the ARMS member had taken to keep the Hero's name going.

Big-sis Anastasia teamed up with Marivel (the last vampire) to fight the demons, and managed to seal Lord Blazer with the power of the holy blade Argetlahm. Thanks to her efforts, the Valeria family became fairly recognised, with the \"Main\" branch of the family being led by Irving who has a sister, Altecia. There's also a sub-branch of the family that's not recognised, with Aisha Valeria (i.e. Kannon).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIrving realises that aliens are coming (enroaching universe-something), so he decides to unite the world to fight it. He funds both a terrorist organisation (Odessa) and an anti-terrorist organisation (ARMS) so that either (a) Odessa conquers and unites the world, or (b) the world unites behind ARMS to fight Odessa.\n\nAnyway, during the prize presentation ceremony after the 3 character introduction chapters, Odessa tries to summon demons, and summons lord blazer into Ashley's body. Ashley somehow fights/resists the influence and pulls out Argetlahm, which combats and balances the influence of Lord Blazer, leading to his Black Knight form (power of light and darkness).\n\nAlong the way, various things happen, e.g. Tim and how his tribe can control Guardians which guard the world by sacrificing someone to keep some sort of barrier up, Brad (who may or may not have switched identities with wheelchair dude, and is probably gay) who's a former freedom fighter who fought alongside Vinny joining ARMS. Kannon, believing she's from a line of demon hunters/slayers (due to the Valeria bloodline), etc. \n\nAshley and his happy friends defeat Vinsfield and his happy friends (also Anthorea is the best villian out there), and the world is united! just as Irving wanted. Ashley gets trapped in space and is rescued by the team, and comes back to find out the alien universe is eating Filgaia's skies. Irving comes up with a plan to shove the universe into a box and destroying the box (i.e. the trapezohedron). Plan doesn't work. So he makes a baby with his sister and shoves the universe into that baby as a medium instead, and you fight that in the.. spiral tower?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat be the main plot.",

I was \"hired\" but at a 100% of subscription click through. When I got all my episodes up, I found on their site a \"contract\" that had truly terrible terms. The contract claimed that nobody had to sign it for the contract to be binding. Well I immediately took all my episodes down. I wrote a fair contract (there are good models on the web) and asked them to sign it for us to proceed. I did another search on them and read they had received a grant to open their business in the American market. Then I found another of their contracts, modified from the one I  found linked through my dashboard on their site. They wrote back to  say that none of their writers was working with a contract. My terms would be the 100% while all the other writers would be at 50% (which I found red-flaggy) I figured that I could give it a try and if they didn't pay me it had been a gable anyway. Next, they sent me instructions on \"Next Steps\" which included choosing the actors, writing a logline, saying what I would do to advertise my story. The last \"Next Step\" is to open up a business page on LinkedIn: \" To further promote the shows, we would suggest building a LinkedIn page dedicated to showcasing your shows. You will be using this page for posting job listings to hire content creators and influencers. This approach will help in building your own brand and expanding the reach of your shows to a broader audience.\" etc. So, I have written them questions about that which sounds red-flaggy to me.\n\nI keep thinking that the page that says they got a big grant to expand and how they have millions of users could be written by anybody and not necessarily true at all.\n\n### Comment ID k5n2k3l with +1 score by [(AutoModerator, Reddit, 2023-10-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/16rxjvc/anybody_ever_hear_of_headfone/k5n2k3l/) (in reply to ID k5n2k1p):\nYour comment was filtered for manual review because it is extremely long (1000+ characters).

I would highly doubt any meaningful pay from them.\n\nI applied for a totally different advertised job through Content Crafters and within a day got an offer of the trial from Headfone, saying that it was in response to my application to Content Crafters. I replied back with some genuine queries that they shouldn't have a problem answering if they were legit, and instead of answering them, I got an email through LinkedIn that my application to Content Crafters was not successful 🙄\n\nAll I asked was how many exisiting subscribers they had, and what was the average conversion rate per series of a well performing story.\n\n### Comment ID k5ab80y with +2 score by [(babadooch, Reddit, 2023-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/16rxjvc/anybody_ever_hear_of_headfone/k5ab80y/) (in reply to ID k5aaa0z):\nCan't share a pic of the email they originally sent, but this is the text of it:\n\n\nHope you are doing well. \n\n \n\nYou applied for the position of Script Writer on Linkedin posted by Content Crafters.

That is not a legitimate job screening process.\n\nI have worked for companies that legitimately outsource to India and unfortunately do so because the pay rate is much lower there per piece (e.g., test questions, written material, whatever else you produce on a per-hour or per-piece basis). This company appears to originate in India, and it may be a legitimate company, but it seems to be using not legitimate tactics to make money by phishing for your interest in a job when in fact, they may not need you. They are looking for non-Indian job seekers who have (ostensibly) more disposable $ to apply to the job (and fail or not get hired) but in applying give Headfone $.\n\n## Comment ID k78jcsd with +2 score by [(KillerScreenwriter8, Reddit, 2023-10-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/16rxjvc/anybody_ever_hear_of_headfone/k78jcsd/) (in reply to ID 16rxjvc):\nScam.

Not engagement, but *subscription*. Included in that 'salary', you partake in the marketing for your own show. I'm weary of anything that pays per subscription model and not hourly--writing takes a lot of time and can be mentally draining after a long day. \n\nThe website looks pretty cool; but there is no concise way of showing how many subscriptions there are to a show, which I think is a little weird. You'd think that every show would have a listed number of subs, even just to lure in new readers. There are likes and comments, but is it worth working there if no one actually subscribes? \n\nEverything I see online ([Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Headfone-Reviews-E4873807.htm) and [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Headfone/reviews)) features reviews that mention terrible pay, and \"scammy vibes\". That the production teams and company staff are nice enough, but wages are unfair. I'm a little disheartened because I'm moving to an area where I need to be paid efficiently. \n\nImo, it seems like a nice startup that hasn't figured out the best business model just yet. I don't think for me personally, that it's even worth finishing the assignment--the company is demanding it in two days' time.\n\n### Comment ID k44x5kh with +1 score by [(Sea-Preparation3921, Reddit, 2023-10-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/16rxjvc/anybody_ever_hear_of_headfone/k44x5kh/) (in reply to ID k2k6wxv):\nOut of curiosity how long did it take for them to get back to you after the prescreening process?

I’m making next to nothing on sales of the audiobooks I’ve produced and returns are an issue. What if the subscriber unsubscribes after listening to two episodes? \n\nI fully agree that without insights into the subscription revenue actually being generated, this is a lame offer.

No timeframe to do it in though, which was weird so I took my time and spent a few days working on it and sent it in. Took like…two weeks to hear back? I honestly got a little freaked with how long it took but I did hear back.

They seem legit, but I doubt pay will be all that good. I’ll probably still do it though just because I miss writing and this will give me an opportunity to do that.

At first I was kind of excited because it was so shitty I figured this was going to be easy money.\n\nThen I saw that the episodes each had like, 5 Likes. And considering the “revenue sharing” is subscription-based, well, the math is pretty easy.\n\nThen I started really putting it together (this was after coffee) and searched for them here.\n\nLike others have said, at best, they get a sub out of you (the discount is only for a month and as others have pointed out, you need to sub to hear your own work) while you create content for them largely for free.\n\nI would call my bank to flag any future charges from them but honestly, the process to unsubscribe is so convoluted I’m not even sure what company name I would be warning them about.\n\n### Comment ID kh576lr with +2 score by [(dreamcatcherpeace, Reddit, 2024-01-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/16rxjvc/anybody_ever_hear_of_headfone/kh576lr/) (in reply to ID kd1up6f):\nSame.

I did go through the whole process and I believe this is a scam. I applied to the job on linkedin, they e-mailed me or a man e-mailed me and said they liked my application and wanted me to do this porject thing, they gave me a code for the subscription and it took off all but 80 cents. I went ahead and paid the 80cents it subscribes you etc, I listened to all the episodes and created a new episode. They said oh awesome we want to hire you, guve us your phone number for whats app and the \"creative team\" will communicate, if you don't have whats app make one etc. So this is where I didn't want to give them my number, I made a google voice number and made a whatsapp business account and gave it to them. After that I haven't heard form them. Its been maybe 2-3 weeks, and I still haven't heard from them, no e-mails, no contact through whats app, when before it took maybe 2-3 days before for them to get back to me.  I went online and cancelled my subscription, which was lengthy. They have a facebook page and bots respond, also I saw another ad on Linkedin for the same job with a different companys name but similar they used the name craft. I don't know if they do this to get more \"subscribers\" to look good for investors, or what, but it's a waste of time and a scam. I hope this helps!\n\n### Comment ID kh5818q with +1 score by [(dreamcatcherpeace, Reddit, 2024-01-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/16rxjvc/anybody_ever_hear_of_headfone/kh5818q/) (in reply to ID kdsdg2z):\nYuppp. Went through the whole process, too, and I'm at the Whatsapp stage sharing the same hesitancy that you had. I'm under the impression that they are \"onboarding\" all these writers in hopes that they'll forget to cancel their subscriptions. If that's the case, that's crappy marketing and completely misdirected. Also, maybe they are getting all these applicants to write different episodes so they can compile a full show with the free labor from the writers...

So i made a whatsapp business account with a google number. They didn't respond for about 4 weeks. I emailed that guy and said hey I would like to be removed from consideration, because of not feeling comfortable with how long it was taking and that if this was an indication of how it would be I would rather not work with them. then a few days after that they responded to my whatsapp number and sent me instructions. i will write what they said, about the process, but by then I didn't want to do it anymore, so I told them on whatsapp i was no longer interested, and they didn't reply. I also looked on linkedin and they have a few people who said they are scams, they have people create these jobs under diffrent companies and basically put people through this process and they don't get paid much if anything at all. It seems like it could be a good thing if they had a better business model and organization, but I just don't trust it all. I also had to jump through hoops to cancel the subscription I made for the practice thingy so my card wouldn't be charged again.\n\n## Comment ID kegphj6 with +1 score by [(ThizzlePieMF, Reddit, 2023-12-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/16rxjvc/anybody_ever_hear_of_headfone/kegphj6/) (in reply to ID 16rxjvc):\nThis is what I thought, and they actually just offered me a position? The same happened to me a few months ago this ago, but for a visual designer to make banner ads for their shows- like the poster thumbnails you click on for Netflix etc. I thought the same thing regarding it being a scam but submitted some images anyway I’d made with gen.whatever.ai and heard nothing till this morning. Still not sure if it’s a scam since all of the shows on their site are garbage (maybe they’re meant for learning english as a first language or something?) but the email offered $3 usd for every banner I submit. Email was well-written and impersonal, asking for my Whatsapp to continue with the process. So again, still kinda sketch, not a great offer compared to other graphic design positions, but the site is real enough and now it looks like more things pop up on Google about them.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/klfb6cb5qu7c1.jpeg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ece554491097da2152292d8bfa69e733987e7696\n\n### Comment ID kfepdic with +1 score by [(jessicalynn425, Reddit, 2023-12-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/16rxjvc/anybody_ever_hear_of_headfone/kfepdic/) (in reply to ID kegphj6):\nI got the exact same email as well.\n\n## Comment ID kfep8kj with +1 score by [(jessicalynn425, Reddit, 2023-12-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/16rxjvc/anybody_ever_hear_of_headfone/kfep8kj/) (in reply to ID 16rxjvc):\nI applied to this job 2 months ago for a Graphic Design Position.

They only pay by subscribers and looking at their other shows, most of them don't have more than a small handful besides from the maybe 5 that hit it big, so no one's getting paid. Then they reveal a rule to you that they never mentioned before you can't write a second show until you're first one brings in 25 subscribers.

Does each \"pack\" have the same territory as far as usable land?  \nThe two largest territories are the white and pink, yet they have the most \"unused\" land?\nIf each territory is equal in usable land, what would dictate this?  Are the packs the same in number?

You'd think they'd have preferred hunting grounds or game trails or something like that, but I guess not. \n\nedit* actually it looks like Yellow at least has a central hub, but Red is almost completely even. I wonder if the streaks of density are game trails or part of a defined route for grazing animals they prey on.

I've put Scarlet Johansens face on a stunt double in Avengers....etc.  That is a very slow and expensive process.  It's also 2000s tech.\n\nScans of actors builds an image in the mind of an actor in some particular scanning situation. Of course that still happens. But everyone knows and understands this needs to be done since Scarlet is t going to throw herself off a train.\n\nWhat this is about, is using footage in the can.  Audio in the can. Test readings and recordings and photography in the can.  And using that to train models so that one can make anyone, anyone else.\n\nGo to Civit . aI and look at the Loras ( this is a model that goes on top of a generic diffusion image generator to produce Scarlet Johansens face v.s. A Face) that teenage nerds have made for all the hot actresses out there for obvious reasons.  It can get quite twisted as you can mix Ann De Aramas Lora with Huge Boobs In White Shirt Loras....the kids these days!!!!\n\nI believe just last week some high school students came under fire for doing this with some of the gals in their school.  Cat left the bag around January of this year.\n\nNow imagine the 2d content that all these studios have of every currently working actor, and every actor that has ever been filmed.\n\nThis isnt about Carrie Fisher and Grand Mof Tarkin...or Rachael in BR 2049. That's old bullshit tech that never left the uncanny valley.\n\nLuke Skywalker in, I think Mandelkrian Season 2, was made using deep fake, which is what we are talking about here. And that was the work of one man. Who produced his own deep fake that looked better than the results out of Disney. Guess what...they hired his ass and he produced Deep Fake Luke.\n\nThe studios have more than enough data to deep fake any actor that was ever filmed. The technology to do it is years old now.\n\nThis is about stopping those fuckers from pressing go, because all the materials and technology is ready to rock. And no doubt, deep within the wells of Disney R&D they are perfecting it till they are told not to.\n\nEveryone needs to learn about this, especially y'all.  If you've been filmed or photographed, congratulations, you've been scanned. And given probably a DAY, they could put you in Star Wars instead of Han or Luke.\n\nYou said waiting...waiting is over my friend. They just need the legal right.  Feel free to share this with anyone you like. People need to understand how this stuff works. Why do you think the studios have such a boner for it...it's exactly as you said.  And if anything I'm probably wrong on some things on the conservative side.\n\nMotion controll camera, 1 male, 1 female, Deep Fakes...let's produce a party with Elvis and Scarlet Johansen singing a duet in front of the entire cast of SNL and Casablanca.  Oh yeah sorry...the audio part is much simpler...lol.\n\nCivit .

She asked the guy to remove it which he did but the others who also used AI for their own entertainment did not like that.

But the cloned actor *never dies*, and you only have to pay for him *once*.\n\n*And*, when the cloned actors no longer bring in big box office, they can just sell them to porn producers.\n\n## Comment ID k8dmy4e with +3 score by [(grimorg80, Reddit, 2023-11-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/acting/comments/17q41fl/studios_keep_actors_strike_going_by_pushing_a/k8dmy4e/) (in reply to ID 17q41fl):\nI said it when the WGA deal was signed: it wasn't that good of a deal when it came to AI rights.\n\nBasically, that deal won some good stuff, like only a human can be credited for a screenplay. Or three for a TV show.\n\nBut the studios won the ability to train AIs with the scripts they have, and to feed AI generated material to the credited writer.\n\nThe first issue is that studios can AI generate an entire Phase of Marvel films, then pay peanuts to a writer. Sure, WGA writers will stick together, but are we sure about that? As a minimum, the WGA must produce guidelines around it, or it's a free for all. In my example I quote Marvel, but more realistically, that strategy will be very effective for second tier IPs. Even more so: to spun out new IPs based on market research. I see a future where scripts are drafted by the data science department, and then refined by the creative teams.\n\nThe second bug issue is for actors. Studios showed they truly want to hold generative AI power. It was obvious they would have needed the same rights for the \"other half of the moon\", meaning performers.\n\nIt's gonna be tough, especially because the concept of celebrity has changed and is still changing. Now we have thousands of creators you never heard of who command millions of followers. When image+video+3D generation will reach a certain level of sophistication, they will be able to produce synthetic actors that look just as real as humans. And considering the level of VFX and CGI used in any kind of production, it's pretty obvious they'll keep improving on those technologies.\n\nAll and all... I think things will get much worse for a while\n\n### Comment ID k8e4uc5 with +2 score by [(westerchester, Reddit, 2023-11-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/acting/comments/17q41fl/studios_keep_actors_strike_going_by_pushing_a/k8e4uc5/) (in reply to ID k8dmy4e):\nI think you misread the WGA deal. It disincentivized training the AI for scripts because they still *must* hire and pay the rate of an actual screenwriter to use anything AI generated, and at the new WGA set minimums. There’s no point in attempting it because you aren’t saving the money that made it a worthwhile endeavor.\n\n#### Comment ID k8e97nx with +1 score by [(grimorg80, Reddit, 2023-11-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/acting/comments/17q41fl/studios_keep_actors_strike_going_by_pushing_a/k8e97nx/) (in reply to ID k8e4uc5):\nYes you are.\n\nMinimum wage is way different from Aaron Sorkin's cachet. The studio that owns Sorkin's scripts can absolutely train an AI to generate infinite scripts in a similar style. They just need to find a writer who's willing to take minimum wage. And you truly and honestly believe nobody will take those jobs?! Seriously? To me that is basically a fact.\n\nWhy would studios do that? The one reason that moves all industries in capitalism: efficiency. They can lower the costs, speed up the process, and have way more control over the product. As I said, I don't see why the \"data-driven\" mantra won't apply to the media industry. I think it's obvious it will. Or at least that they'll attempt it.\n\nOr do you think the studios put that clause in the new contract just to make a couple of nerd employees happy? It's pretty obvious to me. I've been working in digital for 24 years, and whenever a technology achieves the 4 criteria of being cheaper, faster, better and safer, it's used to replace whatever pre-existing solution. \n\nThat means expensive professionals. Look, I'm also gonna be made obsolete by AI, it impacts all of us.\n\n## Comment ID k8ams87 with +1 score by [(AdamBergeron, Reddit, 2023-11-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/acting/comments/17q41fl/studios_keep_actors_strike_going_by_pushing_a/k8ams87/) (in reply to ID 17q41fl):\nUpdate: [https://deadline.com/2023/11/actors-strike-deal-close-ai-1235595961/](https://deadline.com/2023/11/actors-strike-deal-close-ai-1235595961/)\n\n### Comment ID k8at4q3 with +30 score by [(adom12, Reddit, 2023-11-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/acting/comments/17q41fl/studios_keep_actors_strike_going_by_pushing_a/k8at4q3/) (in reply to ID k8ams87):\nDon’t believe anything the media is reporting on, just wait to hear from your union.

          "cons": "I can’t deny it, just as in most companies, and if you really dwell on the negatives, yes…there are several negatives at Gable.  Communication in a company with 145+ staff is not easy and an area we strive to improve.  We haven't always done the best job of providing constant feedback to our staff and that has led to far too many communication issues.  And yes, the Gable management team is guilty as charged that we sometimes seem to be moving in different directions.  We are currently looking to add new managers to help us improve in the areas we have failed.  \r\nIt’s true, we have had management depart Gable for brighter and greener pastures, some that we are even proud that their time with us was mutually beneficial in creating greater opportunities.  For others, the chemistry wasn’t right and we decided to part ways, as we (Gable) also have that choice if we are not seeing the expected results.  One reason for our seemingly dissimilar direction of our management team, is our continued desire to be a leader in the blended industries we serve, while continuing to raise the bar for our staff and ultimately our competition. Our industry, the technology, and the world around us is moving faster than ever before.  We continually strive to remain cutting edge with our innovation, our solutions and offerings, and yes, even aggressive pricing when we have to be.  Our team should be comforted knowing that we know how to win business and recognize the importance of sales in any business.  We move fast to stay ahead of our competition.  On the other hand, we take our time ensuring we make the best decisions; most of the time.  Our culture does not fit every person, every personality, or every situation.  We recognize the need to improve in many areas but we will not apologize when we cannot make everyone happy all of the time; that is not realistic.  Even as an owner I get frustrated that we can't do better, frustrated that we don’t always attract the best people.  I even get down when I know one of our staff is not happy or feels we have not communicated well or they feel we've intentionally mislead them.  I have a very high standard of who Gable should be and will continue to push for greatness, not accepting the status quo.  I take it as a personal challenge each day to make something better, improve a process, demand more from our staff, and especially, demand more from myself.  We take business seriously, but seriously does not mean we are perfect.",

          "pros": "As one of the principles of Gable, it’s hard to deny that the negative reviews and even some of the intentional smearing on this site, doesn't sit well.  It’s not even to say that it’s all false.  In the many reviews on this site, there are actual perceptions of past and even current staff, that whether we like it or not, they exist.  As I read the negative comments, they fuel me to do a better job at everything I touch.  My goal is to be a better leader, a better communicator, a better coach, while continuing to challenge our entire staff to seek the best in everything we do.  \r\nThe posted reviews and comments, whether negative or positive all help us by providing feedback that will give us new goals and new aspirations in reaching our desire to be a great company.  For those few who have taken the time to voice your opinion of Gable, and regardless of your intention either good or bad, I sincerely wish you the best in your future endeavors.  If you are currently employed at Gable, and insist on hiding behind an anonymous and negative post, I encourage you to either assist us in correcting the issues or seek a new place of employment that will bring joy to your life; as no one deserves to be unhappy.  Your negative posts will ultimately hurt you and your closest team-mates.  Additionally, I'm sure that your less than desirable attitude towards a company who provides for you and your family is most likely negatively affecting others.\r\n\r\nI ask that if you are considering Gable as a place of employment, I only hope that you will seek a balanced approach and not only base your decision off of the words of a few individuals who most likely harvest a personal vendetta or didn't fit in with the new direction of Gable. \r\nFor anyone that has held a management position or even owned a company, I think you'll agree, growing a company profitably and successfully in today’s world isn't easy.  In fact, it’s quite difficult.  During the last few years we have had to make difficult choices that have not and will probably never please everyone.  As a seeker of a new career home, we realize that you have a choice.  You obviously are looking for stability, the opportunity for advancements, a positive culture, and most importantly, a fair compensation package.  I am confident that if you do your research and speak to the people who really do care about what they do, you will find that Gable does offer all of what I listed.  And yes, it may not be perfect, but we promise to always do our best to make Gable a great place to invest your time and positive energy!  \r\nAs I write this post to defend what a select few are even trying to destroy, I can't help but to think of the dozens of current team members who have gone out of their way during the last year (new staff and senior staff included) to personally let me know that Gable is a great company.  As it's stated, \"the grass isn't always greener\".  Just this week, a new staff member of almost a year told me that \"they have never worked for a company like Gable who cares so much about their people\".  Now, this is quite a contrast from some of these posts.  I encourage and welcome you to find out the truth, as I’m confident that Gable should be a company to consider!\r\nWe are currently transitioning from a traditional sign company to a global leader in the visual communications industry offering a wide variety of visual solutions.  Our unique blend of digital video displays with A/V (Audio Visual) integration, traditional signs, creative media and content solutions, and commercial and intelligent lighting will allow Gable to successfully compete in any related industry.  Our number one focus in 2016 is to improve our workplace and our culture.  Having a high quality, engaged, and committed staff is what we are striving for in 2016.  You could be part of the exciting times!",

However I quickly learned that Gable was clearly out those who were bringing the company down. There choices have made working there so much better and I appreciate a company who can make hard choices for the betterment of the company. Since starting they have put into effect a new hire program that not only trains the new team member but gets them involved in the culture of the company. The culture of the company has also been a huge improvement since starting I have watched and been apart of departments growing together and working more as a team then separate departments. This company offers so much to their team members to show them how much they are appreciated in such ways as yearly bonuses, holiday bonuses, Christmas parties, month group events such as - company picnic, snowball truck, pizza day, etc. , health benefits, 401k, vacation time, long term and short term disability and so much more great things. They invest time and money into their people with training classes and on hands experience. They don't limit you on what you can do, where, or how you can grow within the company. I have worked several places in my life and I can tell you GABLE is the BEST company I have ever worked for. For me the grass was greener on the other side and I hope to be with Gable for a long time.",

Its rewarding to work with so many great people and sometimes I think the wrong ones are promoted into positions where others could have done a better job. Also, with the company's move into the world of technology driven visual solutions (this is how they say it) I think we should get more training with this type of work, instead of the company hiring outsiders. You say you are into continuous improvement, lets keep this up. I have seen a lot of this and it is exciting!  Finally, keep up your focus on us, your most prized asset! The annual company meeting was the best ever. Enjoyed the sharing of the new vision and direction. You do a great job recognizing our hard work and I think that the 401k profit sharing contributions are generous....keep it up!",

The extra dough is nice, but gets old after a while. My biggest complaint is the parking and think we should have assigned spaces, that way we know that a space will be available for each of us everyday without driving all over the site.",

In the past, this is where the company went wrong and they let these losers stay around way too long. I also have been promoted and received raises on many occasions. This is good, and what I would expect from a company that wants to do right by the people who are helping Gable grow. The events for the team are frequent and appreciated, but we should have more where families are invited. Probably the best thing here is the type of work we do. Its very rewarding to drive down the highway, or watch TV and see some of the amazing stuff we do. They should do a reality TV show about us...its that cool!

It is unfortunate that this team member wasn’t able to fully experience our culture like our long standing team members have. Hiring for the right fit is paramount to delivering the best solutions for our clients. Unfortunately for this candidate, as well as Gable, we don’t always get the cultural fit right in the hiring process. Having the right skill set along with an “All In” attitude are imperative in creating growth – both for our teams members individually as well as the company.  \r\n \r\nRegrettable the “escapades” of one former colleague has perhaps made us overly protective of making sure we have a leader who is qualified and equipped to nurture and develop those important team members. “The Gable way” is how we interact with each other, and is made up of values that most people value and respect.\r\n In fact, we openly share our values. Check them out here -- http://www.gablecompany.com/keystogreatness\r\n \r\nGable continues on an enormous growth trajectory requiring adaptation to enhanced and new processes along with new positions never held here before. Growth creates excitement, and a bit of the unknown. We are fortune to have so many wonderful teammates who are thriving in our fast-paced, entrepreneurial-like environment. We’re sorry it didn’t work out for this individual as we’d hoped, but sincerely hope they will find the “right fit” for their career growth.\r\n\r\nIf you still have any doubts after reading this response, call us, come meet us, meet our staff!  \r\n\r\nThanks for reading!\r\nMatt Gable",

Your comments, both positive and negative, is the fuel that keeps us seeking for greatness!  Thank you for contributing.",
        "cons": "I can’t deny it, just as in most companies, and if you really dwell on the negatives, yes…there are several negatives at Gable.  Communication in a company with 145+ staff is not easy and an area we strive to improve.  We haven't always done the best job of providing constant feedback to our staff and that has led to far too many communication issues.  And yes, the Gable management team is guilty as charged that we sometimes seem to be moving in different directions.  We are currently looking to add new managers to help us improve in the areas we have failed.  \r\nIt’s true, we have had management depart Gable for brighter and greener pastures, some that we are even proud that their time with us was mutually beneficial in creating greater opportunities.  For others, the chemistry wasn’t right and we decided to part ways, as we (Gable) also have that choice if we are not seeing the expected results.  One reason for our seemingly dissimilar direction of our management team, is our continued desire to be a leader in the blended industries we serve, while continuing to raise the bar for our staff and ultimately our competition. Our industry, the technology, and the world around us is moving faster than ever before.  We continually strive to remain cutting edge with our innovation, our solutions and offerings, and yes, even aggressive pricing when we have to be.  Our team should be comforted knowing that we know how to win business and recognize the importance of sales in any business.  We move fast to stay ahead of our competition.  On the other hand, we take our time ensuring we make the best decisions; most of the time.  Our culture does not fit every person, every personality, or every situation.  We recognize the need to improve in many areas but we will not apologize when we cannot make everyone happy all of the time; that is not realistic.  Even as an owner I get frustrated that we can't do better, frustrated that we don’t always attract the best people.  I even get down when I know one of our staff is not happy or feels we have not communicated well or they feel we've intentionally mislead them.  I have a very high standard of who Gable should be and will continue to push for greatness, not accepting the status quo.  I take it as a personal challenge each day to make something better, improve a process, demand more from our staff, and especially, demand more from myself.  We take business seriously, but seriously does not mean we are perfect.",
        "lengthOfEmployment": 20,
        "pros": "As one of the principles of Gable, it’s hard to deny that the negative reviews and even some of the intentional smearing on this site, doesn't sit well.  It’s not even to say that it’s all false.  In the many reviews on this site, there are actual perceptions of past and even current staff, that whether we like it or not, they exist.  As I read the negative comments, they fuel me to do a better job at everything I touch.  My goal is to be a better leader, a better communicator, a better coach, while continuing to challenge our entire staff to seek the best in everything we do.  \r\nThe posted reviews and comments, whether negative or positive all help us by providing feedback that will give us new goals and new aspirations in reaching our desire to be a great company.  For those few who have taken the time to voice your opinion of Gable, and regardless of your intention either good or bad, I sincerely wish you the best in your future endeavors.  If you are currently employed at Gable, and insist on hiding behind an anonymous and negative post, I encourage you to either assist us in correcting the issues or seek a new place of employment that will bring joy to your life; as no one deserves to be unhappy.  Your negative posts will ultimately hurt you and your closest team-mates.  Additionally, I'm sure that your less than desirable attitude towards a company who provides for you and your family is most likely negatively affecting others.\r\n\r\nI ask that if you are considering Gable as a place of employment, I only hope that you will seek a balanced approach and not only base your decision off of the words of a few individuals who most likely harvest a personal vendetta or didn't fit in with the new direction of Gable. \r\nFor anyone that has held a management position or even owned a company, I think you'll agree, growing a company profitably and successfully in today’s world isn't easy.  In fact, it’s quite difficult.  During the last few years we have had to make difficult choices that have not and will probably never please everyone.  As a seeker of a new career home, we realize that you have a choice.  You obviously are looking for stability, the opportunity for advancements, a positive culture, and most importantly, a fair compensation package.  I am confident that if you do your research and speak to the people who really do care about what they do, you will find that Gable does offer all of what I listed.  And yes, it may not be perfect, but we promise to always do our best to make Gable a great place to invest your time and positive energy!  \r\nAs I write this post to defend what a select few are even trying to destroy, I can't help but to think of the dozens of current team members who have gone out of their way during the last year (new staff and senior staff included) to personally let me know that Gable is a great company.  As it's stated, \"the grass isn't always greener\".  Just this week, a new staff member of almost a year told me that \"they have never worked for a company like Gable who cares so much about their people\".  Now, this is quite a contrast from some of these posts.  I encourage and welcome you to find out the truth, as I’m confident that Gable should be a company to consider!\r\nWe are currently transitioning from a traditional sign company to a global leader in the visual communications industry offering a wide variety of visual solutions.  Our unique blend of digital video displays with A/V (Audio Visual) integration, traditional signs, creative media and content solutions, and commercial and intelligent lighting will allow Gable to successfully compete in any related industry.  Our number one focus in 2016 is to improve our workplace and our culture.  Having a high quality, engaged, and committed staff is what we are striving for in 2016.  You could be part of the exciting times!",

Also, with the company's move into the world of technology driven visual solutions (this is how they say it) I think we should get more training with this type of work, instead of the company hiring outsiders. You say you are into continuous improvement, lets keep this up. I have seen a lot of this and it is exciting!  Finally, keep up your focus on us, your most prized asset!

In the past, this is where the company went wrong and they let these losers stay around way too long. I also have been promoted and received raises on many occasions. This is good, and what I would expect from a company that wants to do right by the people who are helping Gable grow. The events for the team are frequent and appreciated, but we should have more where families are invited. Probably the best thing here is the type of work we do. Its very rewarding to drive down the highway, or watch TV and see some of the amazing stuff we do. They should do a reality TV show about us...its that cool!

There choices have made working there so much better and I appreciate a company who can make hard choices for the betterment of the company. Since starting they have put into effect a new hire program that not only trains the new team member but gets them involved in the culture of the company. The culture of the company has also been a huge improvement since starting I have watched and been apart of departments growing together and working more as a team then separate departments. This company offers so much to their team members to show them how much they are appreciated in such ways as yearly bonuses, holiday bonuses, Christmas parties, month group events such as - company picnic, snowball truck, pizza day, etc. , health benefits, 401k, vacation time, long term and short term disability and so much more great things. They invest time and money into their people with training classes and on hands experience. They don't limit you on what you can do, where, or how you can grow within the company. I have worked several places in my life and I can tell you GABLE is the BEST company I have ever worked for. For me the grass was greener on the other side and I hope to be with Gable for a long time.",

      "# [5 Dang Good Data Lineage Tools: Pros, Cons, and Pricing](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-lineage-tools)\nThe good news is that business leaders and stakeholders are increasingly seeing the value of data lineage in their organizations. The even better news is that the data lineage tool market offers more options for data teams every year.Â\n\nAs a whole, the global data catalog market is projected to grow from $878.8 million in 2023 to $4,680.9 million by 2032, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.7% during this period. Thatâs respectable.Â\n\nSo, as more data teams enter the market for lineage tools, itâs important to distinguish the apples from the oranges. Much like data lineage itself, knowledge is power when it comes to vetting potential lineage tools.\n\nThat's why weâre showcasing five potentially potent tools for data lineage here, noting the pros, cons, and pricing for each.\n\nData lineage tools: 5 worth considering\n\nGable.ai\n\nGable is a pioneering data contracts platform that's proactively bridging the gap between data producers and consumers. It focuses on proactive data quality management (i.e., shifting data quality left) by implementing data contracts early in the data lifecycle. In doing so, Gable allows teams to draft, define, and enforce data contracts, providing a collaborative environment for software developers, data engineers, and data scientists.\n\nWhile not a traditional data lineage tool, Gable's approach to data contracts offers a unique perspective on lineage. By defining and versioning data contracts, it provides visibility into data origins, transformations, and dependencies, effectively creating a proactive form of lineage tracking that starts at the source of data creation.\n\nPros:\n\nOffers a highly proactive approach to data quality\n\nUniquely able to integrate directly into development workflows\n\nCan also reduce costs and wasted effort by maintaining data integrity early in the process\n\nCons:\n\nAs a relative newcomer, Gable.ai may present a bit of a learning curve compared to other tools listed\n\nPricing: Interested parties should sign up to Gableâs product waitlist to learn more as details become available.\n\nAlation\n\nAlation is a comprehensive data intelligence platform that offers robust data lineage capabilities. It provides automatic table and column-level lineage, along with business lineage featuring metadata overlays. Alation's strength as a lineage tool lies in its advanced visualization capabilitiesâincluding end-to-end mini-map previews and data flow filtering.\n\nTogether, these features allow users to trace data from its origin through various transformations to its final use, providing crucial insights for data governance, impact analysis, and regulatory compliance. Alation's lineage capabilities are especially valuable for organizations dealing with complex data ecosystems, as they offer a clear, visual representation of data flows across multiple systems and processes.\n\nPros:\n\nA comprehensive data intelligence solution\n\nOffers advanced visualization capabilities\n\nIntegrates with many data sources\n\nCons:\n\nCan be complex to implement and use\n\nMay also be overkill for organizations with simpler needs\n\nâ\n\nPricing: Alation doesn't publicly disclose pricing. Those interested need to contact sales for a custom quote.\n\nSecoda\n\nSecoda bills itself as a data discovery and documentation platform that emphasizes user-friendliness and automation in its data lineage features. It offers automated data lineage capture and visualization, integrating with a variety of data sources and tools to provide a comprehensive view of data flows.\n\nAs a lineage tool, Secoda stands out for its ability to automatically generate and maintain up-to-date lineage information with a minimal amount of manual input. Its column-level lineage capabilities allow for granular tracking of data transformations, making it easier for organizations to understand data dependencies, troubleshoot issues, and assess the impact of changes across their data ecosystem.\n\nPros:\n\nProvides a user-friendly interface\n\nOffers strong integration capabilities\n\nLineage capture can be automated\n\nCons:\n\nAdvanced features may necessitate a learning curve for some\n\nLike Gable.ai, Scoda is a relatively new player in the market\n\nPricing: At this time Secoda doesn't publicly share pricing information. Curious parties will need to contact sales for a quote.\n\nCollibra\n\nCollibra is a solid data intelligence platform offering a suite of tools for data governance, cataloging, and lineage. Its data lineage capabilities, specifically, provide end-to-end lineage mapping with technical lineage at table, column, and transformation levels.\n\nViewed solely as a lineage tool, Collibra provides data teams with a comprehensive view of data flows across an organization. Its interactive lineage diagrams offer intuitive visual representations of complex data relationships, enabling users to easily trace data origins, understand transformations, and assess the impact of changes.\n\nThis makes Collibra particularly valuable for organizations that need to prioritize data governance, regulatory compliance, and maintain an in-depth understanding of their data landscape.\n\nPros:\n\nViewed as a comprehensive data governance solution\n\nOffers strong data lineage visualization capabilities\n\nVery robust metadata management\n\nCons:\n\nCan be expensive for smaller organizations\n\nComes with a comparatively complex implementation process\n\nPricing: Collibra offers yearly licensing subscriptions:\n\n12-month plan: $170,000\n\n24-month plan: $340,000\n\n36-month plan: $510,000\n\nDbt (data build tool)\n\nKnown primarily as a data transformation tool, dbt does data lineage capabilities. However, said capabilities are more limited compared to other tools featured above. It provides table-level lineage within dbt projects, with column-level lineage available in the dbt Cloud Enterprise tier.\n\nTherefore, when viewed as a potential lineage tool, dbt's strength lies in its native integration with data transformation processes.\n\nDbt does visualize dependencies between models, which helps data teams understand how changes in one part of a data pipeline might affect others.\n\nIts lineage features are more focused on assets managed within dbt projectsâmaking this integration of particular value for organizations already using dbt, as it provides immediate insights into the lineage of transformed data without the need for additional tools.\n\nPros:\n\nNative integration with data transformation processes\n\nOpen-source core with active community\n\nVisualizes dependencies between models\n\nCons:\n\nLimited to dbt-managed assets\n\nFull column-level lineage only available in its Enterprise tier\n\nPricing: dbt offers three subscription tiers:\n\nCore: Free and open-source\n\nCloud Team: Starts at $50 per user per month\n\nCloud Enterprise: Custom pricing, make inquiries to dbtâs sales team\n\nWhy are data lineage tools important?\n\nAs a refresher, know that data lineage tools should increasingly be seen as table-stakes for modern organizations to establish (and reap the multitude of rewards from) robust data governance and management practices.\n\nItâs these tools that provide the features and functionality that make fostering and maintaining pristine data quality possible.\n\nEnhanced data transparency and visibility\n\nData lineage tools provide a clear and real-time view of how data flows across an organization, enabling stakeholders to gain deeper insights into data usage, dependencies, and transformations.\n\nOft-overlooked, this transparency also contributes to a culture of impactful data-driven decision-making.\n\nImproved data quality and accuracy\n\nAutomated data lineage tools help identify data quality issues by highlighting anomalies, transformations, and potential errors in the lineage. This early detection allows data teams, stewards, and scientists to address issues promptly, ensuring data remains accurate and reliable.\n\nEfficient compliance and auditing\n\nData lineage is essential for regulatory compliance, especially in industries with strict and/or complex data regulations. These tools provide an audit trail demonstrating how data is used and processed, facilitating compliance reporting and audits.\n\nStreamlined data governance\n\nData lineage simplifies data governance by providing a clear understanding of data assets, their ownership, and the impact of made changes. As a result, lineage tools make it easier to enforce data policies and maintain optimal data quality.\n\nFaster troubleshooting and issue resolution\n\nWhen data issues arise, lineage tools enable faster troubleshooting by allowing data professionals to trace problems back to their source, identify root causes, and implement solutions as quickly as possible.\n\nEnhanced data security\n\nData lineage helps organizations identify vulnerabilities in their data pipelines and access controls, allowing for the implementation of robust security measures to safeguard sensitive information.\n\nEffective change management\n\nBy visualizing how data flows are impacted by changes, teams can assess potential risks and make informed decisions during system upgrades or process modifications.\n\nSupport for data-driven decision making\n\nData lineage empowers more people (both data professionals and their data-adjacent peers) to understand and leverage data assets, supporting true data democratization and enabling more informed decision-making throughout the organization.\n\nOperational efficiency\n\nBy automating data mapping and reducing the need for manual impact analysis, data lineage tools can save significant time and resources, enhancing overall operational efficiency.\n\nRisk management\n\nData lineage manages risks associated with data usage, transformations, and access by providing a comprehensive view of data flow and dependencies.\n\nHow to choose the right data lineage tool\n\nSituations, organizational needs, technical capabilities, and lineage tools themselves are all always in fluxâso there will never be a one âbestâ way to go about choosing the right data lineage tool.\n\nThat said, by carefully considering the following factors and aligning them with your organization's specific requirements, you can streamline to process of learning about and comparing tools, ensuring the chosen tool provides the most value and the best fit possible:\n\nDetermine scope and depth of lineage tracking: Look for tools that provide comprehensive lineage at multiple levelsâtable, column, and row-level lineage. Ensure the tool captures lineage across your entire data ecosystem, not just from limited sources like BI tools.\n\nReview integration capabilities: The tool should integrate well with your existing data stack, including data warehouses, ETL/ELT tools, BI platforms, etc. Check the depth of integrationsâsome tools may claim to integrate with a platform but only offer surface-level connectivity.\n\nCompare visualization and analysis features: Clear, intuitive visualizations of data lineage are crucial for understanding complex data flows. Look for capabilities like impact analysis, data flow mapping, and the ability to trace data upstream and downstream.\n\nDetermine if automation and metadata collection is necessary: Automated lineage capture reduces manual effort and improves accuracy. The tool should be able to automatically collect and update metadata as your data environment changes.\n\nVet each toolâs ability to scale: Ensure the tool can handle your current data volume and complexity, as well as scale as your data ecosystem grows.\n\nConsider usability and accessibility: The tool should be user-friendly for both technical and non-technical team members. Features like search functionality and collaborative capabilities are valuable.\n\nInquire about compliance and governance support: If regulatory compliance is a concern, look for tools that offer features to support data governance and compliance efforts.\n\nAsses potential performance impact: Consider how the lineage tool might affect the performance of your data systems, especially for large-scale implementations.\n\nWeigh cost against potential ROI: Evaluate the pricing model and ensure it aligns with your budget and expected value from implementing data lineage.\n\nPrioritize future-proofing: Choose a tool that can adapt to evolving data architectures and technologies.\n\nGet a sense of each toolâs support and community: Consider the level of support provided by the vendor and the existence of an active user community for knowledge sharing.\n\nDetermine if complementary features are available: Some tools offer additional features like data quality monitoring or data cataloging that may provide added value.\n\nLooking to shift your lineage left?\n\nAgain, the right data lineage tools can dramatically enhance data governance, transparency, and quality within your organization. But it should now be crystal clear that choosing the right solution is crucial. Whether you're looking to streamline compliance, ensure data accuracy, or improve decision-making, having the right tool in your data stack is non-negotiable.\n\nGable.ai goes beyond traditional lineage solutions by introducing proactive data contracts, which tackle data quality at the source.

      "# [8 Common Data Engineering Best Practices](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-engineering-best-practices)\nWeâre told todayâs world is data-driven. Itâs hard to disagree. But, sometimes, itâs equally hard to comprehend how critical it is becoming for any given organization to ensure it can seamlessly integrate and manage high-quality data.\n\nFortunately, as the needs of modern organizations have evolved, so too have engineering best practices that encompass a wide array of processes and technologiesâfrom ETL (extract, transform, load) data pipelines, data integration, and continuous integration to the management of big data, data validation, and real-time data processing.\n\nEffective data engineering is now table-stakesânot only supporting the needs of data scientists, analysts, and end users but also ensuring that data sources, whether from data lakes or data warehouses, are efficiently transformed from raw data into high-quality datasets. This transformation is facilitated by rigorous data validation and data quality checks.\n\nWhile these best practices need to be on point virtually all the time, itâs not always possible to keep up. So, increasingly, data contracts are demonstrating how they holistically make best practices even better.\n\nDonât worryâweâll explain how. First, letâs agree on exactly which best practices weâre referring to.\n\n8 Common data engineering best practices\n\nItâs doubtful that any list of best practicesâin any industryâis completely comprehensive. But itâs important to ensure said lists cover all common bases.Â\n\nFor our purposes here, weâve referenced Joe Reis and Matt Housleyâs excellent Fundamentals of Data Engineering to do exactly that. Here are eight data engineering best practices to keep in mind:\n\n1. Establish and maintain business alignment and value focus\n\nInvest in the long-term viability of data engineering in your organization by aligning all projects to business objectives. This ensures data teams can deliver measurable value and that leadership sees how projects contribute to the success of overall strategic goals.Â\n\n2. Insist on strict adherence to the data engineering lifecycle\n\nWhy wouldnât a data engineer follow the data engineering lifecycle? Well, some sobering realities of working in enterprise organizations include resource constraints, time pressures, complexities in data environments, and even contradictory cultural norms.\n\nAny number of these factors can make it tempting to skip steps or cut corners. However, decreasing data quality while increasing the chance of breaches and running afoul of compliance regulations can never be justified. Itâs also why strict adherence to the entire data engineering lifecycle (e.g., data generation, storage, ingestion, transformation, serving, etc.) forms the cornerstone of any data environment.Â\n\n3. Embrace data as a product\n\nData engineering teams should build on this cornerstoneâencouraging organizations to manage and cultivate data quality with the same care and strategic focus afforded tangible products sold to customers.Â\n\nThe ensuing shift in the collective perspective of treating data as a product enables data management to shift from a supporting role to that of a central, integral function.\n\n4. Build for scalability and performance\n\nDelivering on the promise of data as a product requires data architecture that can scale up and/or out to handle increased loads as needed. At the same time, performance optimization ensures this operational flexibility occurs efficiently (and smoothly), keeping data consumers and users happy.Â\n\n5. Prioritize modularity and automation\n\nBy leveraging modular architecture, components can be independently developed, maintained, updated, or replaced. This simplifies maintenance and can mitigate risk, as failures are isolated to individual components.\n\nConversely, automation minimizes the risks of human-introduced errors and frees up valuable bandwidth among engineering team members. Overall, both increase agility and efficiency in data operations.Â\n\n6. Enable robust security and privacy measures\n\nAs waves of organizations implement digital transformation initiatives, data breaches are surging globally. With data becoming increasingly essential to modern business, data teams must enable and maintain aggressive safety postures to keep bad actors at bay while ensuring regulatory compliance.\n\n7. Foster comprehensive documentation and metadata management\n\nUnderstanding the origin, purpose, and characteristics of data flowing throughout an organization is essential for maintaining data quality over time.Â\n\nThis understanding, in turn, requires effective documentation and metadata management, which additionally contributes to data governance and compliance efforts.Â\n\n8. Sanctify data governance practices\n\nFinally, strong data governance practices should be essential, if not sacrosanct. As such, they should include clear and consistent definitions of roles, responsibilities, and data standards.Â\n\nEffective data governance is crucial for supporting data quality, compliance, and operational efficiency. It ensures data use is ethical, legal, and aligned with regulatory requirements.Â Â\n\nHow data contracts are changing the game\n\nData engineering teams must constantly fine-tune the specifics of these best practices to ensure they remain as practical as they are beneficial. This is especially true as data contracts are increasingly adopted and implemented by data-hungry enterprise organizations.\n\nHowever, before understanding how data contracts impact data engineering best practices, itâs essential to know how they function.\n\nData contracts: Common areas of impact\n\nPurpose and scope: At their most basic, data contracts define the purpose for which data is collected, processed, and shared. The established outline prevents data misuse by clearly establishing its scope usage limits.\n\nRoles and responsibilities: Data contracts will also clearly delineate roles and responsibilities between data providers and data producers, users, and any third parties involved in data processes.\n\nData quality and standards: Drafted contracts will specify the quality and format of organizational data, ensuring it will be consistent and usable across all relevant systems.Â\n\nData governance: Contracts will address all relevant data governance mechanismsâtypically including data ownership, retention, and deletion policies.Â\n\nCompliance and auditing: In addition to collection, processing, and sharing, contracts will also outline how organizational data will remain compliant with relevant regulationsâoften including auditing rights to enforce compliance.\n\nSecurity and privacy: Data contracts will contain provisions for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data, complying with laws such as GDPR, HIPAA, or CCPA.\n\nBreach and dispute resolution: Finally, data contracts increasingly outline provisions for handling breaches of contract, including penalties, dispute resolution mechanisms, and remedies.Â\n\nLesser-known aspects of data contracts\n\nFluidity: Not all data professionals understand that data contracts are rarely static. Like best practices, they often need to be updated and fine-tuned to meet changing business needs, technologies, and regulatory requirements.Â\n\nGlobal variations: Additionally, some data professionals underestimate the complexities introduced by international data transfers in increasingly global markets. By extension, these increase the complexity of data contract drafting and enforcement. But, ultimately, said contracts then better support organizations who navigate increasingly complex and nuanced data environments.\n\nTechnological implications: For some use cases, part of the data contract drafting process will outline specific technological requirementsâpotentially including encryption standards, interoperability protocols, and data formats that may impact existing or future IT systems and processes.\n\nCultural impacts: In some organizations, data contracts influence organizational culture by promoting data-centric approaches, such as treating data as a product. In these cases, data contracts may drive shifts in how teams and departments interface with each other.\n\nCost implications: On paper, complying with the standards and protocols data contracts outline can incur additional costs related to organizational data management. That said, these costs are often offset by enhanced data quality, risk reduction, operational efficiencies, and long-term savings.\n\nPerformance metrics: Data contracts can also incorporate performance metrics and service level agreements (SLAs). By doing so, contracts can help hold parties accountable for maintaining promised levels of serviceâimpacting how data operations are managed and organized.Â\n\nEthical applications: Finally, contracts increasingly help govern the ethical use of data. For many organizations, this helps guide the governance of sensitive or personal information.\n\nHowever, as AI, large language models, and machine learning evolve into a component of business-as-usual, this specific guidance that data contracts can provide will prove exceedingly valuable.\n\nHow data contracts impact data engineering best practices\n\nBased on even the most basic functionality of data contracts, itâs clear they can dramatically improve both data quality and organizational data management.Â\n\nBut as they do so, data engineers should be mindful of how contracts can impact the practices they adhere to daily.\n\nStaying business-aligned and value-focused\n\nClarified expectations and stakeholder alignment are typical byproducts of the data contract drafting process. Structuring and documenting this alignment furthers the ability of data engineering teams to align efforts and projects with overall business goals.\n\nData contracts can also serve to bridge existing (or, perhaps, inevitable) communication gaps that grow between teams and stakeholders over time. As such, contracts not only promote valuable alignment with business goals but also help maintain them.\n\nAdhering to the data engineering lifecycle\n\nWhen a data contract defines quality standards, acceptance criteria, and data validation protocols, it also helps ensure that every phase of data generation adheres to standard protocols, reducing bottlenecks and ensuring efficient data handling.\n\nThis additional definitional fidelity can make them instrumental in helping enforce a holistic, dedicated approach to the entire data engineering lifecycle. A contract in place also serves as a bulwark against resource constraints and cultural pressures that may encourage team members to skip steps in certain situations.\n\nEmbracing data as a product\n\nData contracts enable the âdata as a productâ concept, formalizing the need to treat data with strategic import and elevating the status of data through an organization.\n\nIn addition to enhancing the perceived value of data, contracts help ensure ongoing maintenance and improvement projects get the time, attention, and resources that product upgrades typically enjoy within organizations.Â\n\nBuilding for scalability and performance\n\nOne critical aspect of data contracts involves defining all relevant SLAs. This ensures that designed architectures can meet organizational performance and scalability requirements, efficiently managing data volumes and dependencies.\n\nOnce in place, data contracts establish high standards and expectations for data handling and processing capabilities. As such, they can encourage data engineering terms to develop innovative new solutions for performance optimization techniques.Â\n\nEnabling robust security and privacy measures\n\nData contracts that include specific security and privacy measures help ensure that all data handling conforms to the highest data protection standards. This includes using DevOps frameworks and continuous integration practices to maintain robust security postures.\n\nIn addition to ensuring organizational data meets both regulatory and internal security requirements, these measures also build trust with customers and partnersâessential for organizations working to position themselves well in the face of ever-increasing scrutiny regarding data privacy.Â\n\nFostering comprehensive documentation and metadata management\n\nData contracts require detailed documentation, effective metadata management, and regular data quality checks to maintain a clear understanding of data flows and transformations, which are essential for data quality and governance. This practice ensures that all dependencies are tracked and managed effectively.\n\nThe comprehensive approach this supports also helps with compliance, auditability, and operational transparency, which, in turn, makes it far easier for data teams to trace data lineage and manage the data lifecycle.Â\n\nSanctifying data governance practices\n\nContracts solidify data governance by codifying roles, standards, and responsibilities. This strengthens data governance by making data use across the organization more consistent and ethical, ensuring consistent, ethical data usage.\n\nAdditionally, strong governance supported by contractual obligations can reduce legal risks while enhancing the organizationâs reputation in handling critical and/or sensitive data.Â\n\nMake sure your data engineering practices truly are the best\n\nIncorporating best practices in data engineering is essential for transforming raw data into high-quality datasets that drive informed decision-making. Thatâs what it takes for data to continue to function as the new oil.\n\nBut as big data grows into more and more of an understatement, data engineering best practices need to be as exceptional in practice as they are on paper. That will take a data contract at the tip of the spear, helping data engineering teams excel in providing a true end-to-end approach to data management that supports strategic goals and enhances overall performance, all in real time.",

      "# [The Rise of Modern Data Management - Video](https://home.mlops.community/public/videos/the-rise-of-modern-data-management)\nJoin us at our first in-person conference on June 25 all about AI Quality: https://www.aiqualityconference.com/\n\nChad Sanderson [00:00:00]: My name is Chad Sanderson. My title is chief executive officer. My company is Gable AI. Well, I drink tea. Does that count instead of coffee?\n\nDemetrios [00:00:10]: Welcome back, everyone. We are in another Mlops community podcast session. I am your host, Demetrios. And today, talking with Chad Sanderson, he dropped a few bombs on me. This is probably, I think this is the third time that he's been back. And to be honest, he does not disappoint anytime. He is one of the greatest thought leaders in this space of data platforms, data quality, data engineering, you name it. He has strong stories, and I think the reason that I'm able to latch on to the stories that he tells is that he encompasses and articulates what people are feeling and talking about in the community, on LinkedIn, just in general, so well.\n\nDemetrios [00:00:58]: And he harps on why it doesn't need to be like this. First of all, he talks about the problem. He has a deep understanding of the problem from his experiences as a data engineer, and he knows that data engineers can be a bottleneck sometimes when you have these different roles, like a data scientist or a data analyst are asking a data engineer to go and figure out, go, debug why my data isn't coming in the same format that it was a day ago or why my machine learning model all of a sudden is going haywire. And I think it's a data quality issue. He's able to talk and harp on why data engineering does not need to be 90% debugging. He also goes through what it looks like, what a traditional analytics system looks like, what a traditional data platform system looks like, and how these systems currently break down and why he has set out to fix it, what he's doing at his new company. Gable was really cool to see because I knew him when he was at convoy, and he was talking a lot about the problems that they were having there and also the issues that they were trying to solve, and he mentioned that. And then he went out, and for the last year and a half, he's been talking to just about everyone in the data space, talking to companies small and large about how they are running their systems.\n\nDemetrios [00:02:23]: And he's in a lucky position because he is so well known. He gets to have access to so many different people in different size companies, different maturity levels, and different quality of their data infrastructure, and he can show what it looks like in all of these phases and where there are common problems across all company sizes, maturity levels, you name it. Let's get into this conversation with my man Chad. And as a little aside, a little secret, he's going to be speaking at the AI quality conference. We've got a few tickets left, so come join us June 25 in San Francisco. Oh, yeah. And of course, if you liked it, give us a share. Let us know what you thought of the episode.\n\nDemetrios [00:03:18]: Rate us on Spotify, subscribe on YouTube.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:03:21]: All that fun stuff.\n\nDemetrios [00:03:22]: We will talk to you on the other side. Chad Sanderson, it has been a year since we talked, I think, and when you came on last time, we were beating the drum about data quality. It's probably more pertinent than ever before. I want to know, though. It's been a year, man. What has changed?\n\nChad Sanderson [00:03:49]: Well, in the last year that we've talked, there have been some meaningful, meaningful changes. One, I got married. So congratulations. That was great. That happened in October. And then number two, I started a company, left convoy. I now have a business called Gable AI. And we are, we are, we are off to the races.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:04:16]: Building founders journey is very interesting and different than what I've done before, but pretty rewarding as well.\n\nDemetrios [00:04:25]: I believe it. So I want to get into gable a ton because you pretty much created this term data contracts, and I know you are thinking deeply about data contracts and how to help productize that idea. Before we go into that rabbit hole, though, you've been talking with people for a year, maybe over a year, on how they're implementing their data pipelines, what their data architecture looks like. Do you have insights for us on anything that you've learned when it comes to setting up proper data infrastructure?\n\nChad Sanderson [00:05:06]: Yeah, that's a good question. So I think there's a few major trends that are starting to emerge that are, that are different from the last few years, especially the sort of data bubble, I'll call it, of the early 2020s, where it was the midst of COVID The interest rates were still low, and so growing startups could afford pretty large bills for their data infrastructure. Snowflake databricks a whole host of tools, even if they didn't have that much to show for it, that's something that we're seeing is starting to change. Less companies are starting to assume that the data will inherently be valuable and that teams will just be able to find value within it. And more companies are starting to demand from the beginning that data teams have a good idea of how that data will be used and how it will generate ROI before the infrastructure exists. This is actually a callback to the way the data infrastructure used to be set up and created in the eighties and nineties, before storage and compute was decoupled. If you're a company like Ford and you wanted to invest in a data warehouse, this was an incredibly expensive task. And so you had to think very carefully, not just from a cost perspective, a literal storage and compute cost perspective, but from a human capital cost.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:06:43]: How many people are we going to be deploying to answer some data questions? How many data architects? We'll need to have some tool that's handling all the ETL, doing the transformation in some centralized place. What will we do with the data? And so this is where you see the data warehouse becoming a very popular trend. Not because it was like a generic system that sat on top of all data, but because it was very, very useful for answering a specific set of questions that drive, that were driving business value. And so what we're seeing is teams starting to think a little bit less about building up an end to end stack from day one, or primarily thinking about analytics as the main use case for data. Um, the latter. The latter is actually a pretty important point because analytics for a very long time in a company's life cycle is not going to deliver massive business value. It's more so giving you information about the product. And so it makes sense why product teams really want analytics.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:07:49]: But this is very different from something like invoice reconciliation, which has an actual cost to it. And if you don't do it well, it can impact the business negatively. Same thing with machine learning. And we're beginning to see a rise in more of those, what I would call operational use cases for data, as the primary use cases of data infrastructure, and that requires the infrastructure to be built a little bit differently.\n\nDemetrios [00:08:13]: How have you seen people do this wrong?\n\nChad Sanderson [00:08:16]: Well, I think it ties back to the analytics use case, because oftentimes the impetus for a data investment comes from product teams who want analytics for their product. Organizations can build their data infrastructure in service of analytics and not in service of operational systems. So as an example, a very common analytics data pipeline is you've got Snowflake for storage, you've got a data lake, and you can just throw all the data that you care about in there. You've got something like Fivetran to just quickly plug into these services or databases and move the data into something like Snowflake, and you've got DBT sitting on top of it to very quickly and rapidly transform it. And then you have an analytics tool like looker. This is a very common setup for early stage companies. Teams, basically thousands of teams have been using this. The problem is that setup does not actually scale, nor does it support the operational use cases.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:09:23]: One, there's a quality and governance issue there, which is if we are extracting data from the data producers using a tool like Fivetran, and the producers haven't taken any level of ownership over that data, meaning they're not treating it as a product, they're not treating it as an API, they're not, you know, thinking about, they don't have any accountability to it. Then when something changes, it means it is 100% the responsibility of the data teams to deal with that change. Now, in an analytics world, that's okay, because if the change affects your dashboard, the company doesn't lose any money. You just go in and fix whatever the issue is. But if it's a machine learning model or it's an AI system, it actually does have an impact. You can't just go back retroactively and fix things. Like, especially if you don't know about the change. Like if you've got a, let's say that your model is training every night and you have a data quality issue that maybe your test didn't catch for some reason, then your model is going to be retrained on bad data and the predictions will start having a real financial impact on the company.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:10:30]: That's one instance, but invoice reconciliation is another. Like, if we, if we don't catch that problem in a certain time window and deal with it, there are real, you know, physical consequences. And that means there has to be ownership. There has to be visibility of the data as it flows to the system. There has to be very clear expectations that are divine defined. There has to be some feedback loop from the person that's using the data to the person who's producing the data. There's a whole sort of set of features and functionality that we could talk about. But I think the best way of summarizing it is in the old world, eighties and nineties, you had centralized data management, and you can think about centralized data management in the same way you can think about the management of a library where you've got books coming in, they get stored in a catalog, you've got a librarian, and they're responsible for what comes in.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:11:26]: They know everything that goes out. They're checking what comes in and what goes out. They're organizing the books in a certain way so that they're easily findable and discoverable. And you have a staff of librarians, and this is their job, and it's what they do all day. And I think I read that the average number of books was like 20,000. Like 20,000 books in a library, which is not all that many if you're thinking in terms of datasets. Right. Some companies have hundreds of thousands or millions of datasets, and that was sort of the old way.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:11:58]: And what we're moving to is the federated way. It's like, well, we don't have these librarians anymore that are these centralized kind of people managing all the data in the company and determining who gets to have access and who doesn't. So how do you do this in more of a federated environment where the people who are actually writing the books are making those books available to the people who want the books? What does that system have to look like? And you'll find that it looks a lot more like a bookstore or like Amazon, something like that. And I think that's the change we're undergoing in data right now.\n\nDemetrios [00:12:35]: The question that came to my mind directly, as you were saying, that is just how can we make sure that if we are writing a book, other people come, and in this metaphor, they come and buy our books. And it's not like I just write a book for nobody to read. Yeah.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:12:55]: So that is one area where the metaphor slightly falls down. Because in Amazon, right, the purpose of writing the book is to sell it. But in data, the purpose of producing data may not be for other people to use it. I might produce data as an engineer because I need that data to run my application, right? Like, if I'm collecting data about, you know, a customer goes to my website, I ask them to fill out a form. It includes their name, their age, you know, whether or not they've bought any new socks in the last three days. I will use all of that information as the owner of that service to do interesting things. Like, maybe I want to send them a gift card for their birthday. Maybe I want to show their name on their profile page.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:13:41]: If I know they haven't bought any new socks in the last three days, maybe I'm going to show socks as, like, the number one item for them to buy in their list of referred items. Like, I'm actually using that data for something. And so I'm not thinking about how other people in the company might be using that data as well. Right? Like, if. If I am, if I'm saying, hey, this is useful to me, the way most organizations work is that the data teams will come in and look at all this data that's stored in the transactional system, and they will say, well, this is actually really important data for me, too. Like, we would like to know what the average age of all of our customers are. Maybe there's something meaningful we want to do with that. Or we want to know, like whether or not, you know, people have bought socks in the last three days.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:14:25]: Like, is that a relevant question for us to continue asking? What should we be showing them? In those cases, they will use tools like Fivetran, these data extraction tools, to forcibly rip the data out of the hands of the engineers that are producing them and put that data into their own environments where they can analyze it. Now you have this problem where the engineering team is making the changes to the data that they really care about. That makes sense for them, and that might mean changing stuff. They might decide, hey, I've got today in my database, I've got sort of a first name field and a last name field, but I don't think that's relevant. We're wasting space or whatever. So I'm going to create a single column that's just called name. Now, as long as it is only affecting me, that's no big deal. It's just my service.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:15:16]: I build my service in a way that can handle that change. But if these downstream teams are extracting data and they're expecting, maybe they're putting into some marketing automation or something, and they're always expecting first name, last name to be in different fields, and I've just broken that downstream marketing automation. The problem I feel, is not that these product engineers don't care, it's that they don't know, right? Like if you go to any application developer and you ask them, do you know how your data is being used and you know where dependencies on you exist and what it's being used for and how valuable it is to the company, most of these developers are going to say, no, I have no clue. And if they don't have any clue, then to your point, they are not able to even start thinking of, how do I make this data available in a safe, structured way, to make it accessible and to make it fit for purpose in the application world? It makes total sense to try to build in, you know, in this very decoupled way where I'm not stepping on anyone's toes. I can move as fast as I want within my own service. I don't have to depend on or rely on anyone else. And the whole purpose of that is speed. And the reason speed is important is because this is the age of rapid iteration and rapid experimentation.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:16:38]: We know that some features are not going to work with customers, we know some will. The faster that we can ship things and we can try things out, the more that we could hill climb our way to some sort of meaningful success with that product. But data is not like that. If I am computing a metric called profit, by definition, that metric will take a dependency on some other metric called revenue, and another metric called cost. And the revenue metric will itself take a dependency on the variety of sources of revenue within a company. When I worked at Microsoft, one source was Bing ads revenue. And then you also had all the revenue you got from selling windows, and then you got the revenue you had from the Microsoft store. These are all sources of revenue.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:17:34]: And then if you trace that line all the way back, then you can split it out into the individual line items. And so there are these chains, these trees of dependencies that form when you're trying to answer questions on data. And that cannot be decoupled, right? It's impossible to decouple that. And so when you step back and you actually look at how the data flows throughout a company, it does look more like a supply chain, where you've got a producer of kind of the raw materials, and these might be the logs that are being emitted from some service. And then that data gets transformed in some raw layer or silver layer of a data warehouse into a bit more normalized, a bit more aggregated. And then they get transformed yet again into a domain. And so here's all the events for a particular business unit. And then from there, they're transformed again into a particular metric.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:18:38]: And then it sort of on and on it goes. And if there's any break in the chain at any point, then it has a ripple effect to everyone downstream that is leveraging that data. And so, like, one of the things we've kind of been dancing around while we're having this conversation is this idea of change management, right? If I am a software engineer and I'm trying to make changes to my code, there are very well understood systems on how to do that without causing damage to everyone else that is dependent on that code. And we call this DevOps. If I'm an engineer and I'm adding a new feature that goes through a process, there's unit tests and there's integration tests, and there's pull requests. So humans look at these changes and then I get a diff. So there's things that make it easier for the humans to actually review the changes. Then there's a whole process that runs to merge the branch back into the main trunk of the codebase, then there's a whole process of ensuring that deployment is safe.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:19:47]: Then there's tools like launchdarkly that allow you to toggle that feature on and off. Then you've got tools like amplitude and Mixpanel that actually track how the business users or how the users engage with that feature. All of this is change management. I've made a change. I want to make sure that that change was safe and it had the intended effect. But if you look at the data world, none of that exists. None of that infrastructure I just talked about exists and data changes just as frequently as software changes. If I'm an engineer and I'm making a change to my database, that's data changing.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:20:26]: If I'm adding a new event that is emitted every time a user interacts with a feature, that's data changing. If I'm removing an event, that's data changing. Data is changing all the time. Yet there is no system for the teams actually leveraging that data to give any human in the loop review or feedback. There's no integration testing for data. There's no way to actually check to make sure that the data is flowing the way that it is supposed to. These are all things that you detect after the fact, right? Like, way after the changes have already happened. And generally you're looking at the outcomes, the use case, like you're looking at me.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:21:09]: You're saying your machine learning model has failed, and that's how I know that a data issue has occurred.\n\nDemetrios [00:21:16]: Yeah. All of a sudden the dashboards are starting to go wild and it's like, ooh, maybe that was because my data was a little bit dirtier than I had thought and it exchanged one too many hands or somebody did something upstream that I have no idea how or what, and then I have to go and be a detective and figure out what exactly who was changing what and where did they change it?\n\nChad Sanderson [00:21:42]: Oh, yeah. Well, I think it's on. It's on both sides of the workflow as well. There's definitely the workflow of a thing has changed. I have been impacted. How do I root cause this and what do I do moving forward? Usually that work is put onto the data engineer, because if you're a data scientist or an analyst, you don't know that.\n\nDemetrios [00:22:04]: It's very hard just saying, hey, it stopped working. What's going on? Why is this going all a wire?\n\nChad Sanderson [00:22:10]: Why did this happen? I have no idea. All I know is that it's impacting me, so I'm going to escalate it to, to my data engineering team. And then data engineering is usually the one that has to trace the lineage and say, okay, well, where is this data actually coming from? I can try to manually figure out the services that may have changed. I can look at the pull requests over time. Then I have to go and talk to the owners of those prs and say, hey, did you make a change? Did it impact this? I have to manually investigate it myself, and then I have to convince them that they need to roll that change back or put in a fix into their pr. And that takes time, right? Because they don't really care. It doesn't affect them. So it goes onto their backlog, it may take weeks, it may take months, and then once the fix is actually put into place, now I need to do a backfill, and that's the data engineering team.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:22:56]: And usually there are way fewer data engineers in a company than there are data scientists or analysts. So they become a bottleneck, right? They're getting all of these requests, they're kind of like stacking and it's very hard to address them all. That's sort of one side of the problem. And then the other side of the problem is, well, if you don't trust the data to be accurate and if there's no clear ownership of the data, that means it is your responsibility as a data scientist to make sure with, you know, 100% confidence that this data means semantically what you expect it to mean, that there's validation rules in place, that if anything changes, you are going to at least know about it. And hopefully it doesn't totally blow your model up. And that takes a lot of time and effort and work too. In fact, I think I've read like 75% of data science time is spent on validation. And that might seem like, oh, well, that's just kind of the state of the world.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:23:54]: But this is not how software engineers work. They don't spend 75% of their time trying to figure out if the API that they're ingesting is giving them the right thing or not. Like they trust that API because it is an API. It's very clearly documented exactly what this thing is that they're consuming, what it means, how to use it, and because that API exists, it means they can take a dependency on it and just refer back to the documentation and the usage and the spec on how to manage it properly. When you think about data in that way, data is an API too, right? When I'm taking a dependency on data coming from some database, it's just another interface. And yet I'm doing that without the contract. There's that word that a software engineer gets when they are leveraging an API for their services. I'm taking the dependency, but I'm not getting any of the guarantees.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:24:58]: I'm not getting any of the ownership, none of the trust, none of the documentation. And I think, like, this is one of the big things that needs to change.\n\nDemetrios [00:25:07]: All right, real fast, I want to tell you about the sponsor of today's episode, AWS, tranium and inferencia. Are you stuck in the performance cost trade off when training and deploying your generative AI applications? Well, good news is, you're not alone. Look no further than AWS's tranium and inferencia, the optimal infrastructure for generative AI. AWS, tranium, and inferencia provide high performance compute infrastructure for large scale training and inference with llms and diffusion models. And here's the kicker. You can save up to 50% on training costs and up to 40% on inference costs.\n\nDemetrios [00:25:50]: That is 50 with a five and a zero.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:25:54]: Whoo.\n\nDemetrios [00:25:55]: That's kind of a big number. Get started today by using your existing code in frameworks such as Pytorch and Tensorflow. That is Aws, tranium, and inferencia. Check it out. And now let's get back into the show.\n\nDemetrios [00:26:09]: So, how are you doing it? Are you basically inject? I'm thinking about those tests that you can get when you go to the doctor, and they check to see if your veins are clogged or not, and they put something inside your veins, and then the blood pumps all through the body, and you can see where there are places where you have, like, different clots or parts of the veins that aren't working as well because it's been tracked, right. I think it's, like, blue dye or something. And so under the special machine, you can see, like, okay, these veins are not working that well, and you have a clear picture of it. I almost feel like you need to do that, where you put a stamp on the data, and if it comes out of this API, then it is with this, like, pedigree, and you know these things. But then if anybody takes it and then they use it, and you then have that data downstream from three or four different transformations or uses, or people have touched it in many different ways, you can still retrace it because it has almost, like, all the different pedigrees as it's gone through this supply chain.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:27:26]: So the way that we think about. So what you're describing right now is sort of, I think, a more advanced form of data lineage. And if folks in the audience are not familiar with data lineage, it's essentially the process of starting from the either the looking at generally, it's sort of looking at an analytical environment and parsing through SQL and basically stepping through each query and understanding how that query was built. What table does it rely on and what table does it produce? And when you can answer sort of all of those questions for every query in your data environment, then you effectively have this big graph, and the graph shows you how one column flows to all these other different tables and views in the company. This is really great if you're using a tool like Snowflake or databricks. And the reason why is because these companies have effectively built abstraction layers on top of data. They have created the interface, which as an example would be Snowflake SQL. And everybody knows how to interact with Snowflake SQL.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:28:39]: You also have tools like DBT that write the transforms. And DBT also provides an interface that's even easier to use than Snowflake SQL. And they actually manage a lot of this lineage work for you. The problem is generally not downstream. By downstream, what I mean is what happens to the data after it arrives in some environment that a consumer of the data can do something with it. So it could be a notebook, it could be Snowflake, it could be databricks, right? It's somewhere, as long as I can access the data as like a data scientist, the problem is not really there. It's everything prior to that. Because where that data is coming from doesn't have nice clear abstractions.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:29:26]: It's the wild west, right? Like the data could be coming from, we could have a Python script that's pulling out Excel spreadsheets and dumping these CSVs into a data lake and then pushing that on some cadence into our analytical database. And anyone at any point in time can go in and make a change to the structure of that file and we would never know about it until it actually reaches us, which is too late. It could be a software engineer that is adding new logging to some feature that they've created. And then we're pushing that event via Kafka into a database. And then from the database we're going into the analytical environment. And so if I don't know that, if I don't have the link between the analytical environment and the event code, I will always have to, that will always be a manual slog for me because I will have to make that connection myself. And this is sort of the state of the world for a lot of data scientists. There is that gap between when the data actually lands in some storage system and what's going on before that.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:30:42]: And so when people talk about, like, a source of truth, that's what they're talking about, right? When someone says, hey, I want to know the source of truth of these transactions. They're not talking about the table and snowflake. They're talking about the actual moment that the event of a transaction occurs. And what does that mean? What is the underlying code that is producing that interaction, and where can they find that? So in terms of what Gable does, there's a few things. Gable is kind of a meaty platform. We tackle this problem in modular pieces. People can use any number of the modules that we produce, or they can tie them together into a more seamless experience, which is where it really gets magical and powerful. But the core of the platform is what I would call our API.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:31:37]: We can build a consistent abstraction on top of many different types of data sources automatically. So if you think about what actually makes up any data source, there's really only two components. There's the structure of the data. So that would be the schema, the data types, column names, stuff like that, and the semantics. What does that structure actually mean? What does any particular column or row mean in the real world? And then there is the contents of the data itself. So those values that I would expect from that data, if I have five categorical values in some particular field, I would never expect there to be a 6th or 7th suddenly appear. Like, maybe my system is not built in such a way to deal with that. Or if I have an age field, I would probably not expect their age to ever be less than zero or greater than 300, unless you've got putting.\n\nDemetrios [00:32:43]: Conditions and almost like guardrails onto the data so that people understand, okay, no matter what and how tainted things can get, the data is not going to come out like this. And if it does, we need to figure something out. Are you alerting people if it does show up like that? Or is it just not allowed and you get like a null or.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:33:05]: It's a bit of both. So there's sort of a flow that happens. So there's really like four main steps in gable. The first step is the identification of these data sources. And we have some magical AI driven mechanisms to scan a code base and to automatically figure out where in code is data being produced. And so that could be, we can figure out. Here's all the database tables that are being produced. All the structures that exist in your code, here's all the event code that's being produced.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:33:41]: We could connect to some file structure like s three, scan through s three, and then figure out for each file, is this file related to data? Does it have a schema and stuff like that? Or is this more of like a non data related file? Is it just like a word document or something like that? Once we have all of those, and we could do this with third party stuff too. Salesforce, SAP, whatever, it doesn't really matter. But once you have all of those identified, then we can extract structure and we can extract contents of the data and we can represent those in a standard format. So it doesn't matter if it's a postgres transactional database, if it is a segment event, a Python dictionary, a.net, executable, Java, whatever, all of that data can be extracted and organized and formatted in the exact same way. Once that's in place, we can then automatically enrich that data with lots of useful information. So because we're injecting ourselves into the git version control platform of choice. So GitLab, GitHub, whatever, you can extract the ownership on the repo level, who is the person that actually owns the code that is producing this data, that is true ownership. You can extract how that data asset has changed over time, and then you can also extract how are these assets actually connected to each other.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:35:20]: Like where do we see the same information in different assets? And that's sort of the lineage graph that I mentioned before. Once you have that and that all happens sort of automatically. Now, once you have that, now you can start to have humans come into the loop and a human can say, okay, well I have some expectations on this particular data, and those expectations might be the constraints you mentioned. So there might be some specific constraints that you have in mind that a machine would never really be able to figure out. Or maybe a machine could figure it out by doing some profiling, but we're not there yet. Or it might be something like an SLA, like hey, I always expect there to be 1000 events emitted over this time period, and if that number ever drops, it means something is probably wrong. What we can do then is based on the expectation we can alert when we detect a change is going to happen or has happened. So if you're in Ci CD, for example, we will know, is the structure of this code event going to change based on a PR hey, a software engineer has decided to get rid of a column that you, the data scientist are using.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:36:41]: We know that before that happens, same thing for new things being added. The other option is to look at the contents of the data and to say, hey, the contents of the data have changed in a way that are going, that's going to affect your machine learning model. We're going to tell you about that before the pipelines actually run and cause.\n\nDemetrios [00:36:59]: All that damage, which I imagine just seems like magic for anybody that you talk to or that you're working with, because you're like, oh my God, that is going to be a lifesaver for me. I've been spending 75% of my time trying to figure this out, and now you're just telling me it's going to work. That's incredible.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:37:15]: Well, there's a lot of things that you get for free with a system like this that I think are really cool. I mean, one thing is because we're registering the source data, then you get a nice sort of catalog of all of your data sources, which is the things that most data, data people actually want. Right? Like I said before, they don't care as much about the tables, and then from there they can, they have to go back to the sources anyway. They just want the sources. And that's something that we get. We get that for free because of this registration process. Same thing with the change management live change detection is a big part of our platform. We have a change log, so it shows over time.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:37:58]: How has a data asset changed? Who actually made the change? What was the change? It's all the context that's very relevant for the teams that are consuming all this information. And there's a bunch of other things too around data contracts and how do we agree on them and how do we collaborate as the data evolves? The thing that was most meaningful to us when we built this is how do we help the data producer. So the engineer or the salesperson or whoever is generating this data understand that they are not in an isolated environment anymore. And as long as we can integrate with GitHub or GitLab, because we're automatically scanning and profiling this code and figuring out what it's connected to and who is dependent on it, we can provide that feedback without them actually having to do anything. Meaning, if I'm a software engineer, I'm just going about my day to day work, and I'm shipping features, and I decide to change some SQL code that exists somewhere in my system. I will be told by Gable, hey, you're about to change records that other people in the company are using. Here are the people in the company who are using these records. Here is what they are using those records for.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:39:18]: You need to go and speak to them before you make this change. Or at the very least, you should write up a summary of what this change is going to be. And Gable will manage communicating that to the right people. Right. So it's not about like, applying AI magic to turn the data, resolve all data quality issues or something like that. It's applying the AI magic to bring the people together and have closer connectivity when it comes to managing and creating data in the first place.\n\nDemetrios [00:39:50]: Yeah. Just that awareness has got to be so brilliant for teams. I'm curious about you. A year, year and a half ago, left convoy with ideas on what was going to be the most valuable. It seems like you had a pretty clear vision, but it's been polished over the last year and a half. What is one or two features that people have been asking for nonstop? And you almost, like, are surprised by these features because for you, that was a non thing, but now you're talking to a lot of different companies.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:40:31]: I think something I wasn't expecting is how much of an end to end system teams really want. My initial goal when I set out was, can we build something that by pressing a button, can scan all of this code and then figure out who owns that data? What does this actually mean? And put the constraints, like the CI CD constraints in there and really start to treat data as another step in the DevOps process. That was my main goal, is bringing DevOps to data and using data contracts as the vehicle to do that. What I found, though, is that people have a much broader vision of what data contracts are. There's the CI CD approach that I mentioned, but people also want contracts for cataloging purposes. I get all of the source data in one place and I can actually sort through that source data and sort of segmented by domains. People also want the live change detection on their data sources. So I want to see how, I want to know when someone makes an update in excel in real time so that I can either protect myself or protect my data consumers on a platform team.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:41:54]: And I never want these issues to actually reach the analytical database in the first place. Right. So there was a lot more interest in that than we originally thought. And I would say I've also been surprised. Oh, sorry, go ahead.\n\nDemetrios [00:42:09]: I was just looking at how far upstream you are going. You're thinking like, very far upstream. And if you can catch this in the moment this data is created, I think that's where you want to live?\n\nChad Sanderson [00:42:26]: Yeah, our goal is to go all the way, all the way upstream. I think that they're all the way.\n\nDemetrios [00:42:33]: Maybe all the way.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:42:35]: I think that there are some places where you can't do that or there are problems that are introduced outside of that core data source. So, for example, you may have a human that is entering some data into a text field and they just enter in something that should never be entered. It doesn't make any sense and doesn't work with your pipelines or your dashboards. You can't really catch that during the CI CD workflow because there's no code being changed, but you would be able to catch that basically as soon as that data becomes accessible through some system, moving it from that front end interaction to either the database or the analytical database, you want to try to catch that as soon as humanly possible. But really, I think that the future is going to be all about code and also direct integration with any platforms or source systems that modify data, excel or Google sheets or Salesforce or SAP. A lot of data work happens in these products and there really is no oversight for data quality or data governance. If I'm a salesperson, I'm going to change around my Salesforce schema in a way that makes sense for me and my team in the way that I want it. But if that sales data is really critical to downstream teams, there's no real way of them knowing that or understanding that.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:44:08]: And so all of that, like change management, change detection, CI CD, these are all places we want to insert ourselves.\n\nDemetrios [00:44:17]: I want to just look at the other side of this, which is if you didn't have that, it's like you have to then go and manually in each one of these systems, try and create something that says, hey, alert me if this ever gets changed. And just thinking about that almost gives me a headache. On all these different data sources, on all these different people that you're interacting with, maybe for a small team at a startup, you're running fast, it doesn't matter that much. And you can deal with that technical debt once you find product market fit or you start taking off. But if you're at a gigantic company, just the amount of people that are working at that company that you would have to interface with to try and figure out like how am I going to protect my assets, which are these things that I've been working on for the past, whatever, three to six months. And I thought I was having success with them, but little did I know somebody that I have no idea in some random department changed everything. And now I don't know why, but I got to go debug it. Or I got asked by data engineer to debug it.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:45:32]: Yeah, exactly. At these big companies, there are thousands of people potentially who all touch different parts of the data that you're using, and you have no clue. A lot of these teams have thousands of microservices, tens of thousands of datasets, hundreds of thousands of CSVs. There's just enormous, enormous amounts of data, and it's very, very unclear where it all comes from and what it means and why it exists and when it changes. And so it's not just any change that happens. It's anytime you want to use that data, you have to go. There's actually this relatively narrow safe zone where you've already gone out and done all the work to understand what the data is and where it's coming from and what it means and all that. And that takes a lot of time.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:46:26]: And then there's all the changes that could potentially happen to that data because it's plugged into so many sources. So you've kind of got this relatively infrequent window where everything's okay, everything is safe, and you've just kind of perpetually got your fingers crossed that today is not going to be the day, but it always is the day. At some point. At some point, the day comes, and when it does come, it's very scary and it's a big problem.\n\nDemetrios [00:46:58]: That's why I've been championing for the data engineering appreciation day.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:47:03]: Yes, data engineers definitely need that.\n\nDemetrios [00:47:06]: So before we jump, what was the other feature that surprised you, that people were asking for a bunch?\n\nChad Sanderson [00:47:12]: Yeah. Well, I think the other thing that was surprising to me was that how excited data producers and software engineers were about this. I think that data teams really, really underestimate. There's a bit of a Stockholm syndrome going on, I think, where they've probably tried in the past to go to their engineers and say, hey, I need you to own this data, or I want you to be more thoughtful about me. And they kind of got brushed to the side, or the engineering team said, hey, this doesn't really matter. But I think that may just be the perception. When I've talked to data producers, they all seem to acknowledge the problem. They're like, yeah, we understand that this is an issue because we get asked about it all the time.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:47:56]: The issue is like, I, as a software engineer, don't have a mechanism to help them with this. Right. All of the solutions that I'm given is like, well, you need to be very thoughtful about what data lands in this table. But I don't know anything about Snowflake. I don't know anything about data bricks. I don't know anything about the data lake. I don't know about the ETL systems that you're using. I don't know anything about DBT.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:48:21]: So it's like, in order for me to help you with this problem, I have to learn like four or five different tools. I also don't have any way of, like, if something does go wrong, I don't know how to resolve that. I don't, I don't know how to root cause it. I don't even know how to figure out if it was a big deal or not. I don't know what right or wrong even looks like. So there's like this whole list of, you know, requirements that need to be met in order for a producer can take ownership. And if those, if those questions are not answered, then this just seems like a very murky, unclear, difficult problem. And they don't know how big of an investment it's going to be and so they don't do it.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:49:02]: And so when they see that the way, the way that we tackle this is, oh, this is all DevOps, this is just another step in the workflow that I already run where we're accounting for data the same way that we account for security or the same way that we account for code quality. And, oh, if I do make a change, that's not good. I'm going to be told and I'm going to be given all the context on everyone I need to talk to and why I need to talk to them and what good actually looks like and what I need to do in order to progress this pull request forward. That is very exciting. It turns this from kind of a nebulous, unclear, very confusing problem to something that is very clearly scoped, very clearly defined, and fits into the workflows that they already use. So that is what I think is probably the biggest and most interesting thing to me is just how much software engineers have gravitated towards these solutions.\n\nDemetrios [00:49:58]: Are you interfacing more with the DevOps teams or is it data engineers? Is it a little bit everybody? It feels like since the surface area is so big, you have to make sure that you are on top of it with each one of these people and that you understand their needs just as much as anybody else.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:50:19]: Yeah, I mean, I think the data engineers and data platform teams are probably still the folks that we talk to the most because they're impacted the most. They have the most. There's the most for them if there's data quality. Right, exactly. For the data consumers. So the data scientists and the analysts, they're also impacted, but they're impacted in a different way. They're usually not the ones kind of doing all the root causing and the lineage, all the stuff that takes a bunch of time. They just want to make sure that it doesn't happen, and they don't really care how it happens.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:50:55]: And then on the side of the data producers, they don't want to cause people pain. They don't want to be seen as the bad guy, and they certainly don't want to be in a situation where the whole company knows that they were the ones responsible for an outage to their machine learning model. That's what they want to avoid, but they just don't have the systems to do it. We start in the middle, and then we work our way out. What my guess is, is that over time, um, we will go the same route of. Of the devsecops kind of workflow. I think dev data ops will become a term that most DevOps teams and most engineering teams are using. And that means, like, selling, mainly selling into the software engineering organization.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:51:44]: And, like, in the same way that software engineers, they, they've now started to realize that security is a critical part of their workflow. They can't just pass that off to someone else in the organization and kind of wipe their hand cleans of it. It's their responsibility, too. If they don't do security best practices from the beginning, then hacking and fraud will inevitably happen, and all you can do is deal with it. In the same way, if you don't do data management from the beginning, data quality issues will happen, and you just have to deal with it. And that's not acceptable anymore. In the age of artificial intelligence, maybe in the age of analytics, it was acceptable, but now it's becoming a lot less acceptable.\n\nDemetrios [00:52:26]: So, funny you mentioned that, because I was just at Kubecon two weeks ago, and every other booth was a security booth. And so it is very much understood that there are no excuses for any type of security breach. So I do see this vision where you're like, we cannot use these excuses anymore for poor data quality or just for poor data practices, because so much of the business is relying upon this. You have so many different use cases that are coming from the data, and if you can quantify that even better, and it feels like when you have things set up and you know where the data sources are and you know how the data is being used. And that rich lineage, you can tell, okay, this data is giving us. It's generating a whole ton of money through these machine learning models or through these other examples that you showed. I think that is another one that just, like, gives. It shows the teams the value of the data in a way that is irrefutable.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:53:34]: Yeah, exactly. I think that we are going to start to see a big shift over the next five to ten years, not just in the tools, but in the companies that are using data. And it will split from companies that are using data for analytics primarily. And those companies will invest in low cost tooling. So very cheap storage and compute, very cheap analytic systems, probably open source. And then on the other side will be companies that are actually using data to make money. AIML is obviously one example, but there are other ways that you can monetize data or use data to save large costs. Invoice reconciliation is one example that I mentioned.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:54:20]: And those companies are going to have to treat data like a product from the very moment of its inception. And that means not just putting quality into place downstream, but upstream as well.\n\nDemetrios [00:54:34]: Beautiful, man. Well, I always appreciate coming on here. I'm super excited to get to meet you in person for the conference. We are going to be talking about this so much. We're gonna spend the whole day talking about quality. I had to have you there because when I think about quality, I. You're like one of the first people that comes to my mind. And it's.\n\nDemetrios [00:54:56]: It's almost like we couldn't have a.\n\nDemetrios [00:54:58]: Conference about quality, AI quality, data quality without having you there. So, yeah, this is gonna be fun. It's gonna be a whole lot of fun. And we're gonna get to talk about this stuff all day long.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:55:11]: Amazing. Well, I can't wait for it. And I will show up in my Sunday best and I'll cut my beard and so I don't live like a wild man out of the cave.\n\nDemetrios [00:55:21]: That's it. Actually, on a not so serious note, I was thinking, like, should we do some kind of a theme, like a hawaiian shirt or something? So if anybody has any ideas, throw them at us, because I am open to it right now. It's not too late to figure out what the theme or what the fun things that we're going to do are. We're already going to have a comedian there. We're going to have some jam sessions happening, so beware of that, too. I don't know the quality standards on those. We may need a tool like Gable to check on the upstream possibilities of the quality and give the stamp of approval for the musical session qualities. But you'll see when you come.\n\nDemetrios [00:56:12]: I guess that's. That's the fun of it.\n\nDemetrios [00:56:14]: Hold up.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:56:15]: Wait a minute.\n\nDemetrios [00:56:15]: We gotta talk real fast because I am so excited about the MlOps community conference that is happening on June 25 in San Francisco. It is our first in person conference ever.\n\nChad Sanderson [00:56:27]: On.\n\nDemetrios [00:56:27]: Honestly, I'm shaking in my boots because it's something that I've wanted to do for ages. We've been doing the online version of this. Hopefully I've gained enough of your trust for you to be able to say that I know when this guy has a conference, it's going to be quality. Funny enough, we are doing it. The whole theme is about AI quality. I teamed up with my buddy Moe at Kalena, who knows a thing or two about AI quality. And we are going to have some of the most impressive speakers that you could think of. I'm not going to list them all here because it would probably take the next two to five minutes, but just know we've got the CTO of Cruz coming to give a little keynote.\n\nDemetrios [00:57:11]: We've got the CEO of you.com coming. We've got chip, we've got Linus. We've got the whole crew that you would expect. And I am going to be doing all kinds of extracurricular activities that will be fun and maybe a little bit cringe. You may hear or see me playing the guitar. Just come. It's going to be an awesome time. Would love to have you there.\n\nDemetrios [00:57:36]: And that is again, June 25 in San Francisco.\n\nDemetrios [00:57:41]: See you all there.",
      "# [AI Pack: Roof Characteristics by Vidya_5002 on 2022-08-02](https://help.nearmap.com/kb/articles/789-ai-pack-roof-characteristics)\nDescription\n\nThis AI Pack can be purchased as an add-on to the Residential Building Footprints pack. It adds AI Layers and AI Parcel outputs related to:\n\nThe dominant material of the roof (shingle, tile, metal or other)\n\nThe presence of various structural shapes on the roof (hip, gable, flat and turret presence)\n\nTrees overhanging the building.\n\nPack layers\n\nRoof\n\nTile\n\nShingle\n\nMetal\n\nHip\n\nGable\n\nDutch Gable\n\nFlat\n\nTurret\n\nTree Overhang\n\nLeaf-off Tree Overhang\n\nDormer Window\n\nAvailability\n\nIf you subscribe to Roof Characteristics or Building Characteristics, you must also subscribe to Building Footprints.\n\n3D Roof Characteristics\n\nIn Gen 3 data, a new attribute was introduced - Dominant Roof Pitch. This is calculated from our 3D data using a similar approach to the 3D attributes in AI Pack: Building Characteristics. See the description there for when and how the 3D related attributes are made available.\n\nDominant Roof Pitch\n\nMeasured in degrees from horizontal, this is the pitch of the largest area of the roof. It is calculated by assessing the surface normals of the roof area, and identifying the most prevalent surface normal. Where multiple pitches have been used in a roof, this will NOT provide an average - it will be (approximately) the most commonly appearing pitch by area.\n\nRoof Material\n\nRoof Material includes a group of three AI Layers:\n\nTile\n\nShingle\n\nMetal\n\nIt also includes a \"dominant roof material\" category in AI Parcel exports (both as a column in the spreadsheet and as an attribute associated with a building footprint polygon in the GeoPackage file), which can take the value of \"Tile\", \"Metal\", \"Shingle\" or \"Other\".\n\nThe Dominant roof material is the material taking up the largest horizontal area of the roof (as long as it covers at least 50% of the total area). So a mostly tile roof with a metal extension would be denoted as tile. If there is no clear dominant roof material, it is classified as \"Other\".\n\nCharacteristics and Recommended Use\n\nThe dominant roof material is provided to avoid confusion in the very common situation where a shingle or tile roof has a small metal extension. In some situations (due to lighting conditions for example) it can be very difficult to tell the difference between tile and shingle, or between metal and other fairly featureless roof types. This shows up as less bright areas in the AI Layer viewer. The dominant roof material simplifies this information by making the best choice of overall roof material given the information available.\n\nTiles are much less common in certain parts of the US, which means that the majority of roofs identified as tile are lower confidence. This is because a certain percentage of shingle roofs will always be mistaken for tile, and an absence of actual tile roofs means that these errors form a much larger percentage of those detected as tile.\n\nShingles are almost never used in Australia whereas they are the most common roof type in most parts of the US. This means that the majority of roofs in Australia identified as shingle are lower confidence. This is because a certain percentage of tile roofs will always be mistaken for shingle, and an absence of actual shingle roofs means that these errors form a much larger percentage of those detected as shingle.\n\nThe practical performance of the metal roof attribute varies with region, depending on how prevalent it is, and how common other roof materials are.\n\nThe lower number of \"Other\" roof material in Australia means that less of the \"Other\" predictions are confident (as Australia is almost exclusively tile, metal and concrete roofs).\n\nRoof Shape\n\nThe set of roof shape attributes each detects whether there is at least one structural element of the roof with one of these definitions.\n\nHip\n\nGable\n\nFlat\n\nTurret\n\nDutch Gable\n\nDormer Window\n\nTree Overhang\n\nTree Overhang can be defined as any case where there is some tree (leaf on or off) protruding over the top of a Building Footprint. A Tree Overhang AI Layer is available for viewing in MapBrowser . Polygons of tree overhang, as well as area estimates, are available in an AI Parcel export.\n\nCharacteristics and Recommended Use\n\nWhen presented as a \"Y\" or \"N\" flag in the CSV file, Tree Overhang may not be directly useful. It detects any amount of overlap at all, such that more than half of the properties in our coverage area are listed as having tree overhang. Where the overhang is used to identify trees that may need trimming, or calculating property risk, it is recommended you use the area estimate to set a meaningful threshold (e.g. only look at buildings with >10m2 of overhang). In more advanced use cases, you could use the area directly to rank properties from highest to lowest amount of overhang, or as a continuous variable to use in a statistical model. It is also possible to consider the shape and position of the tree overhang sections on the building, obtained from the geospatial file of exported AI Parcels.\n\nThe confidence values for Tree Overhang are particularly low, because the edges of trees that overhang a roof often fade out gradually between high confidence and very low confidence. The area estimate of Tree Overhang is recommended as a better means of adjusting whether mild, moderate or extreme overhang should be included for your particular application.\n\nLeaf-off Vegetation Overhang\n\nLeaf-off Vegetation Overhang is very similar to Tree Overhang in that it intersects the roof outline with the Leaf-off Vegetation layer. There are several key use cases for this data.",
      "# [Gable Steveson makes switch from wrestling to football by signing with the Buffalo Bills by John Wawrow, Associated Press on 2024-05-31](https://www.click2houston.com/sports/2024/05/31/gable-steveson-makes-switch-from-wrestling-to-football-by-signing-with-the-buffalo-bills/)\nORCHARD PARK, N.Y. – Olympic gold medal wrestler Gable Steveson is seeking to trade the mat for the gridiron by signing a standard undrafted rookie free agent contract with the Buffalo Bills on Friday.\n\nThe Bills list the 24-year-old Steveson as a defensive lineman in hopes his leverage techniques and agility can translate to football.\n\nListed at 5-foot-11 and 266 pounds, Steveson, at 21, became the youngest freestyle wrestler to win gold as a super heavyweight at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. He then went on to win two college national titles at Minnesota in 2021 and '22, and twice was named the Dan Hodge Trophy winner as the nation’s best college wrestler.\n\nAfter his second college championship, Steveson left his shoes in the center of the mat, symbolizing his retirement from amateur wrestling.\n\nIn Buffalo, Steveson joins a team with a head coach in Sean McDermott who was a two-time high school national wrestling champion growing up in Pennsylvania. And while McDermott went on to pursue football after high school, he credits wrestling for helping shape his life.\n\n“I have been fortunate to compete at the highest level of competition in my sport but am looking forward to the challenge of seeing how my wrestling skills may translate to football,” Steveson said, in a statement released by his agent, Carter Chow. “I am grateful to Coach McDermott, (GM) Brandon Beane and the Buffalo Bills organization for giving me this opportunity.\n\nAlthough Steveson's contract with Buffalo spans three years, it is not guaranteed unless he makes the team.\n\nThe Bills opened a spot to add Steveson by releasing Matt Haack, one of three punters on the roster. Buffalo re-signed Haack this offseason after adding him to their practice squad in the playoffs as insurance when Sam Martin was bothered by a hamstring injury.\n\nSteveson becomes the second player without past football experience Buffalo has added to its roster this offseason. Last month, the Bills used their final pick to select former English rugby player Travis Clayton in the seventh round of the draft. The 23-year-old Clayton, listed at 6-foot-7 and 303 pounds, is projected to play offensive line after spending this past winter learning about American football in the NFL's International Pathway Program.\n\nSteveson won gold at the Tokyo Games by scoring a dramatic last-second win against Geno Petriashvili. He had numerous options after the victory, and chose to return to college for a year and cash in on the new name, image and likeness rules that allowed college athletes to make money.\n\nHe signed an NIL deal with World Wrestling Entertainment before his final college season and later joined the company.\n\nAfter joining WWE, Steveson briefly returned to amateur wrestling last year. He competed at the U.S. Open and Final X and won both in dominant fashion. That qualified him for the world championships, but he chose not to compete.\n\nSteveson initially joined the WWE with much fanfare. He was mostly part of its developmental brand, NXT, before being released in May.\n\nSteveson is from Minnesota, and his mother named him Gable in honor of wrestler Don Gable, who won gold at the 1972 Munich Olympics.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Cliff Brunt in Oklahoma City contributed to this report.\n\n___",

Post wildland fire assessments suggest that this mechanism is one of the leading causes of home destruction in wildland urban interface (WUI) fires. However, the process of ember deposition and accumulation on and around houses remains poorly understood. Herein, we develop a deep learning (DL) model to analyze data from a series of ember-related wind tunnel experiments for a range of wind conditions and roof slopes. The developed model is designed to identify building roof regions where embers will remain in contact with the rooftop. Our results show that the DL model is capable of accurately predicting the position and fraction of the roof on which embers remain in place as a function of the wind speed, wind direction, roof slope, and location on the windward and leeward faces of the rooftop. The DL model was augmented with explainable AI (XAI) measures to examine the extent of the influence of these parameters on the rooftop ember coverage and potential ignition.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nWildfires are becoming an increasing risk to people living in wildland urban interface (WUI) communities due to the climate change induced growth in the number and severity of wildfires [1,2,3]. For example, 17 of the 20 largest wildfires recorded in California, USA, have occurred in the past 10 years [4]. WUI fires can cause significant home destruction and loss of life. Recent examples include the Camp Fire in California, USA [4] (85 fatalities and 18,800 destroyed structures), the Black Friday Fires in Victoria, Australia [5] (173 fatalities), and the 2019/20 bushfire season in New South Wales, Australia [6] (26 fatalities, 8000 structures destroyed).\n\nOne of the largest contributors to home destruction is spot fires caused by embers (also known as firebrands) landing on and around structures leading to their ignition [7,8,9]. Embers can be formed from burning vegetation [10,11] or structures [12,13] and range in size from around 1 mm to almost 0.5 m [14]. Once embers have detached from a burning object, they can be lofted into the atmosphere by the buoyant fire plume and then transported ahead of the main fire front [15]. This process is typically modeled using either a plume dynamics model [16], a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation [17,18], or wind tunnel testing [19].\n\nResearch in this area has primarily focused on the so-called ember dragons [13,20,21] that generate embers from burning wood particles and then fire them at structures using an air jet. These dragons have been used to examine accumulation and ignition for a range of geometries, including in front of obstacles [22], along fences [23], and various building components [24]. These studies have provided significant insight into the conditions under which ember accumulation can lead to spot fire ignition.\n\nHowever, these studies lack full dynamic and geometric similarity as they do not model the full structure and wind field. Recently, experimental studies of ember accumulation on and around structures where full flow similarity was achieved have been published [25,26,27] that highlighted the complex interaction of the turbulent wind flow and the building geometry that leads to ember accumulation. For example, Ref. [26] showed that only a very small percentage of embers land on a building rooftop compared to the number that land on the ground over the same area. When in contact with the roof, embers either fall off, are blown off, or are blown to rooftop regions that allow embers to come to rest. These rooftop dead zones, where embers remain at rest despite the wind flow, are clearly important in understanding structure ignition as they are regions where embers can accumulate in large enough numbers to ignite rooftop spot fires.\n\nAn experimental analysis of rooftop dead zones, referred to as hotspots hereafter, was presented in [28]. In this study, the roofs of model buildings were covered with model embers and then exposed to a range of wind speeds and wind angles. Tests were run for rectangular buildings with gable end roofs of different roof slopes. Care was taken to ensure dynamic similarity by carefully selecting roof covering and ember materials that have the same coefficient of friction as full-scale embers on an asphalt shingle roof. Geometric similarity was achieved by matching the ratio of the building size to the ember size, though only the larger end of the ember size spectrum was modeled. The tests conducted measured the rooftop locations where embers remained in contact with the roof surface throughout the test.\n\nQualitative results showed that the rooftop locations where embers remained in contact were controlled by the roof slope and the flow separation over the structure. For example, there was a clear indication of ember scour due to corner vortices when the wind approached from a 45° angle to the long axis of the building. There was also scour on the leeward side of the rooftop due to flow separation vortices from the roof ridge. An image analysis of the videos taken during each experiment allowed for the calculation of the fraction of the rooftop that remained covered with embers. However, these data were primarily used for the qualitative description of the causes of ember removal and quantification of particular flow phenomena. The data were not used to develop a predictive model of ember retention on rooftops.\n\nMore recently, there has been an ongoing interest in incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) by means of deep learning (DL) into the area of wildfires to enhance our understanding of the associated risks (i.e., home fires, casualties, and environmental effects). For example, Jain et al. [29] identified 300 relevant research works on integrating AI into wildfire domain problems. These researchers also noted that the use of AI aligns well with wildland fire sciences and wildfire management, especially when using sufficient, high-quality data [30]. AI has been used to predict the occurrence of wildfires through historical wildfire data using various methods, including deep learning (DL) [31,32,33,34]. Additional work also noted such use to predict the probability of fire occurrence by building either a classification model [35,36], regression model [37,38,39], or a combination of both categories [40,41].\n\nCurrently, there is limited work on specialized problems, such as ember accumulation on roofs. Thus, integrating modern technological approaches (e.g., AI) can offer a significant step toward understanding the dynamics and physics behind such a complex problem. Along the same lines, AI shows the potential to predict wildfires through various methods, but the complexity and anonymity of the internal workings of AI predictive models can be seen to limit their acceptability among users.\n\nTo overcome the aforementioned limitation, explainable AI (XAI) provides insights into AI models’ decision-making (prediction) process. Utilizing XAI tools eases the complexities associated with AI models and allows researchers to identify and communicate the importance of different input variables in influencing a prediction. A prime example of XAI tools is the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) [42] summary plot, which provides feature importance and, most importantly, a direction of feature influence on the prediction based on the model’s understanding of the given task.\n\nThe literature shows that ember accumulation on buildings can lead to home ignition. This research addresses the overarching question, ‘what building features lead to accumulation of embers?’ Previously published wind tunnel experiments quantified where embers can remain in contact with a rooftop. Therefore, the specific research questions for this project are: ‘Can XAI identify building geometric features that lead to accumulation?’ and ‘can XAI explain why these features are important?’ See Figure 1 for a workflow diagram of this research project.\n\nThe results shown below demonstrate the following:\n\nThe DL model is capable of accurately predicting the fraction of the roof that retains embers as a function of the building geometry and wind conditions;\n\nThe XAI tools can identify the nature of the relationship between the ember coverage and the building and wind parameters;\n\nThere is a distinct difference between the behavior on the windward and leeward retention processes that was elucidated by the XAI data.\n\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows. The experimental method used by [28] is briefly reviewed in Section 2, including a description of the parameter space tested and the image analysis tools used for data extraction. The DL model development and explainable AI tools used are described in Section 3. Model results are presented in Section 4, including a discussion of the model performance, explainable AI metrics, and limitations of the current study. Conclusions and suggestions for future directions are given in Section 5.\n\n2. Experimental Methods\n\nA series of experiments were carried out in the Clemson University atmospheric boundary layer wind tunnel with gable roof buildings with different roof slopes. The roof pitches used in the experiments were flat roofs and roofs with slopes of 2/12, 4/12, 6/12, and 10/12. The rooftops of the model houses were covered with model embers before exposing to the controlled wind load condition. The area of embers retained on the rooftop during and after experiments was tracked with a camera. These tracking images were then used for analysis.\n\n2.1. Experimental Conditions\n\nThe flow similarity was carefully considered with both geometric and dynamic similarities to make sure that the lab-scale experiments modeled real-world problems. Geometric similarity was satisfied by matching the scale-down ratio for both model buildings and model embers. The model building was built with a geometric scale of 1/30. The model eave height was selected to be 10.1 cm (4 in) with a wall length of 20.3 cm (8 in) by 40.6 cm (16 in). This scaling ratio of 1/30 was selected to ensure that the cross-section area of the model building did not exceed 5% of the total wind tunnel cross-section area. This was to avoid the acceleration of the flow around the blockage generated by the building [43]. The resulting model building’s dimensions are shown in Figure 2 and Table 1. The model represents a full-scale building with plan dimensions of 6 m by 12 m (20′ by 40′) with a 3 m (10′) eave height.\n\nModel embers were mass produced from pine straw. To satisfy the geometric similarity, model embers also needed to be scaled down at the same ratio as the model building, i.e., 1:30. To meet this scale down ratio, the model ember diameter had to be 0.16 mm and mass production was not practical for this study. The embers that were produced for this study had a mean length of 5 mm. The results of the embers retained on the rooftop presented in [28] proved that the size of the embers is significantly smaller than the size of the buildings and the retained ember area. Therefore, although the model ember sizes did not meet strict geometric similarity, the results could be reasonably extrapolated to full scale. The details of the ember production and the explanation of the satisfaction of the ember’s geometric similarity are presented in [28].\n\nDynamic similarity was met by equating non-dimensional force ratios at full and lab scale. The forces in this study are the aerodynamic forces on the house, the aerodynamic forces on the embers, the ember weight, and the friction between the embers and the roof material. The material of the fabric that was used to cover the rooftop of the model houses was selected to have the same friction coefficient as the shingle on the full-scale houses. This was to make sure that the model embers stayed in contact with the rooftops of the model houses under the wind load in a similar pattern as in the full-scale case. The process of testing the rooftop materials for the model houses is described in detail in [28], in which P60 sandpaper was chosen for covering the rooftop of model houses.\n\nThe similarity requirement of the aerodynamic forces on the houses should be satisfied by matching the Reynold number between full-scale and lab-scale experiments. However, this is not possible in boundary layer wind tunnels. However, according to [44], the flow becomes independent of the Reynolds number if it is larger than 7500. Therefore, provided the wind speed used in this study was greater than 1.1 m/s, we satisfied dynamic similarity for the flow over the model buildings.\n\nIn a similar way, the aerodynamic forces on the embers are dependent of the Reynold number, which is about 2000 for full-scale and approximately 140 for model embers. However, the drag coefficient for embers in the shape of cylinders with a length to diameter ratio of 8 is approximately constant over those Reynold numbers [45,46]. Although the Reynolds number matching was not satisfied, the drag coefficient was similar for both the full-scale and lab-scale scenarios.\n\nEmber weight was reflected through the gravitation force, which is included in the non-dimensional Tachikawa number [47] as:\n\nK = ρ a i r u 0 2 ρ e m b e r g L\n\n(1)\n\nwhere ρ a i r is the density of air, u 0 is the wind speed at the eave height, ρ e m b e r is the ember material density, g is gravitational acceleration, and L is a characteristic length of the ember. Knowing the air density and the ember’s properties, the wind speeds in the experiments were adjusted based on the range of full-scale windspeed during an WUI fire to obtain the same K number for both full and lab scale.\n\n2.2. Summary of Test Conditions\n\nSix buildings were tested with an identical width of 20.3 cm (8 in), a length of 40.6 cm (16 in), and a height of 10.1 cm (4 in), but different roof pitches of 0/12 to 10/12 with 2/12 increments. The dimensions of these buildings are demonstrated in Figure 2 and are summarized in Table 1.\n\nWith each building listed in Table 1, the experiments were carried out with 7 different wind angles of 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 degrees, where 0 degrees of wind direction is the case when the long side of the building is perpendicular to the flow, while 90 degrees is when the short side of the building is facing the wind flow. For each wind direction, each building was tested with 6 different wind speeds. The wind speed was measured at the eve height of the building. The wind speeds measured were 2.7, 3.1, 3.3, 3.5, 3.8, and 4.1 m/s (see Table 2). Hence, for each building listed in Table 1, there were 42 experiments (test conditions) (see Table 2).\n\n2.3. Image Analysis\n\nDuring each experiment, a camera was placed above the roof and was used to record the roof surface. This was then used to determine the area of the rooftop on which embers were retained. The experiment was ended when a visual observation confirmed that ember removal had stopped.\n\nThe image of the recording was then downloaded onto a computer and processed using the Matlab Image (MatLab R2023b) analysis toolbox. For each test condition (experiment), the image was cropped to show only the roof and then converted into a black and white image. The conversation was performed by applying an algorithm to differentiate the area covered by embers and the area of ember removal (see [28] for more details on this process). An example of an original image of the roof after an experiment and the black and white image is shown in Figure 3 below.\n\nThe area of retained embers on the roof was identified by a black color, where a black pixel has a value of 1 while the white pixel has a value of 0. Therefore, the total fractional area of retained embers on the rooftop can be quantified by summing the total value of the black pixels and dividing it by the total number of pixels in the image.\n\n2.4. Qualitative Result\n\nA total of 252 separate tests were conducted in this study for six roof slopes, seven wind directions, and six wind speeds. Some broad qualitative behaviors were observed. For example, it is clear that the ember removal was significantly impacted by the structure of the flow separation over the building. This can be seen in Figure 3, which shows significant ember removal along the path of the corner vortex that forms when the wind approaches a building at a 45° angle. It was also observed that increasing the roof slope did not always increase ember removal due to the flow separation over the roof ridge. A more detailed description of the experimental results is presented in [28], which presented data for the fraction of the entire roof surface on which embers were retained. However, while general results were discussed in [28], the paper does not develop a predictive model for ember retention and only addresses retention on the entire roof, despite the qualitative differences in ember retention on the windward and leeward sides of the rooftop. This paper seeks to address these shortcomings by breaking the experimental dataset into leeward and windward retention fractions and reanalyzing the data using deep learning techniques. The dataset analyzed consists of 504 separate roof segments with the retention fraction being controlled by the wind speed, wind angle, roof slope, and windward/leeward roof location.\n\n3. Deep Learning (DL)\n\nDL represents a subset of AI inspired by the human brain’s structure. The foundational work by McCulloch and Pitts in 1943 [48] laid the basics of understanding how the brain’s neuron’s function and since then has inspired the development of artificial neural networks (ANN). An ANN capitalizes on training neural networks with deep and fluid architectures to contain the unique structure of a series of processing layers. An ANN with multiple hidden layers can be formally termed a DL model.\n\nA typical DL model consists of multiple layers of artificial neurons that process information by passing inputs through weighted sums and nonlinear activation functions. In each layer, each neuron receives input from all neurons in the preceding layer, forming a matrix-vector multiplication. Below is the general formula for a matrix-vector product, where a is an (M × N) matrix, and the subscripts are the trained parameters of the preceding layers. From the above matrix multiplication, one can say that the output coming from the dense layer will be an N-dimensional vector.\n\n( Ax ) = a 11 ⋯ a 1 n ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ a m 1 ⋯ a m n x 1 ⋮ x n = a 11 x 1 + a 12 x 2 + … + a 1 n x n ⋮ a m 1 x 1 + a m 2 x 2 + … + a m n x n\n\n(2)\n\nAdditionally, activation functions within these layers introduce nonlinearity, enabling the network to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data beyond what linear processes can achieve. Common activation functions include the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), which reduces the likelihood of vanishing gradients during training, thereby supporting deeper network architectures. The sigmoid function is another commonly used activation function that maps any input value to an output that ranges between 0 and 1, making it particularly suitable for tasks where the output is a probability or a fraction within this range. Figure 4 shows the above-mentioned activation functions’ identity functions. It should be noted that other examples of activation functions can be found elsewhere [49].\n\nFinally, dropout layers can be critical in enhancing a DL model’s generalization capabilities, preventing overfitting [50]. In the dropout layer, a random subset of neurons is omitted during the training phase, which prevents the model from becoming overly dependent on any single feature and reduces the risk of overfitting. This technique effectively encourages the network to improve performance and reliability when exposed to new, unseen data. Together, dense layers, activation functions, and dropout layers constitute essential components that empower DL models to tackle various predictive modeling tasks.\n\n3.1. Deep Learning Model Description\n\nThis section describes the development and validation of a DL model that can predict the accumulation of embers on a flat roof. This research utilized a comprehensive image database of ember accumulation on roofs conducted at Clemson University’s wind tunnel [28]. Subsequently, images were processed and analyzed to determine the total number of black and white pixels. The black pixels represent the accumulated embers, while the white pixels represent the areas from which embers were removed due to the imposed wind. The next step was building a DL model to predict the accumulation of embers based on the image analysis. Lastly, we implemented an explainability tool (i.e., SHAP) [42] to address the key factors influencing the accumulation of embers based on three scenarios.\n\nUsing the complete ‘Full’ database of roof images, including leeward and windward sections;\n\nThe database is segmented into two datasets based on the side feature;\n\nLastly, the third segment of the windward dataset is selected for further examination.\n\nIn all three scenarios, the same model was initiated to observe the changes in the key influencing features and the changes in the roof settings on the accumulation of embers (which is tied to the possibility of ignition). Observing such changes offers explanations to better understand the DL model’s predictiveness, which, in turn, enhances the building’s fire safety and provides a safer roof setting to lessen the accumulation of embers on flat roofs.\n\n3.2. Database Preprocessing\n\nThe collected database consisted of 504 roof images with various settings. Each image in the database illustrated ember accumulation under various features (conditions). Hence, the ember accumulation was selected as the target feature (output). The number of black pixels in the image represents the accumulation of embers (see Figure 3b). That is, the model did not take the images as its input but rather the fraction of the roof surface that remained covered with embers. The selected features as input included roof slopes, wind direction (denoted as an angle), wind speeds, and the side feature, which specifies whether the scenario was on the windward or leeward side of the roof.\n\nThe preprocessing stage started by importing and analyzing the images to extract the features from the images. Factors such as side, roof angle, and wind speed data were directly extracted from the source database using identifiable patterns related to the experimental setup. On the target (output) front, ember accumulation, the developed model calculated the accumulated embers on the rooftop by counting the number of black pixels in each roof image. The number of black pixels was then divided by the total number of pixels (white and black pixels) to normalize the target feature between 0–1. The above-mentioned extracted data were recorded and structured in matrix arrays as an input database for the model to make predictions.\n\n3.3. Model Architecture\n\nAfter a series of tuning steps, the designed DL model consisted of four dense layers, which allowed the model to learn and identify relationships between various features and the target label (the fraction of the roof surface covered in embers). The input dense layer contained 504 neurons with an input dimension mirroring the dimensionality of the input database and 128 for the leeward and windward datasets. Subsequent (hidden) layers were progressively smaller, with 64, 32, and 16 neurons respectively. Finally, the model architecture ended with a final dense layer with a single neuron, making a funnel-like ANN model structure for data processing—see Figure 5. The ‘ReLU’ activation function was selected for the input and hidden layers to introduce nonlinearity into the learning process. However, the ‘linear’ activation function was selected for the output layer since the target feature was a continuous fraction between 0 and 1 [51]. To combat overfitting, we implemented a dropout layer with a 20% rate to randomly ignore a subset of neurons during training.\n\n3.4. Dataset Partitioning and Model Training and Evaluation\n\nDuring the model’s training phase, a systematic analysis of selecting 200 epochs, with a batch size of five, provided the model with enough iterations to learn and balance the computational efficiency. Adopting the Adam optimizer [52,53], which is known for its adaptive learning rate properties, facilitates more accurate and practical model updates. This optimizer was instrumental in guiding the model toward an optimal set of weights, ensuring that each update was meaningful and conducive to the model’s overall learning curve.\n\nThe model’s performance was validated against a subset of the dataset to confirm the effectiveness of the learning process. This step was critical to ascertain that the model advanced beyond mere memorization of the training data. The dataset was divided into training and validation/testing sets, with a 70:30 ratio between the training and validation/testing data. It is noteworthy that the dataset was split using ‘sklearn train_test_split’ [54] in a random manner, with a condition of ensuring a non-changed data distribution. Upon completion of the training phase, the model’s predictions were evaluated against actual values in the validation set. The employed performance metrics were the coefficient of determination (R2) and the mean absolute error (MAE) [55,56,57]. The R2 score measures the quality of the model’s predictions of the actual data variance. The MAE, on the other hand, quantifies the average magnitude of errors in the predictions.\n\n4. Results and Discussion\n\nThis section represents the outcomes of the data exploratory and XAI analyses. The discussion will focus on displaying the Pearson and Spearman correlation matrices. However, the ‘side’ feature is binary; hence, it will be discussed using the Point-biserial correlation. Subsequently, we focus on the model performance during the training, testing, and validating phases. Following that, we illustrate the results from the SHAP summary plots by focusing on the three segments of datasets used in this analysis, namely, the full images database, a second dataset that includes the leeward roof side of the images, and finally, the dataset that comprises only the windward side of the roof images.\n\n4.1. Correlations\n\nThe Pearson correlation coefficients heatmap, which demonstrates the strength and direction of a linear relationship between the fraction of black pixels and all other features, is shown in Figure 6. This heatmap identifies which variables have the largest and lowest degrees of linear correlation with regard to the fraction of black pixels (fraction of the roof surface that retains embers), which is indicative of ember accumulation.\n\nOne can observe a mix of negative and positive correlations in the last row. The most notable negative correlation appears between wind speed and the fraction of accumulated embers, with a coefficient of −0.59. This strong inverse relationship suggests that increasing the wind speeds contributes to less ember accumulation. In addition, the coefficient between the roof slope and the fraction of black pixels is −0.35, indicating that the steeper roofs experience less ember accumulation. The correlation between the angle and the fraction of black pixels accounted for only −0.2, representing a relatively weak negative correlation. We opted not to discuss the ‘side’ feature in the Pearson correlation matrix because it can only be used for continuous features.\n\nThe Spearman correlation coefficients heatmap is shown in Figure 7. This shows the degree of monotonic relationship between the fraction of black pixels and the other features. Similar to the Pearson correlation coefficient, the most significant negative correlation is between wind speed and the fraction of black pixels, accounting for around −0.83. The roof slope accounted for a Spearman correlation of −0.55 with the fraction of black pixels, suggesting that roofs with greater slopes tend to have less ember accumulation, which is in line with the monotonic but not necessarily linear trend this measure captures. The angle presents a milder negative Spearman correlation of −0.33 with the fraction of black pixels, indicating a less strong yet inverse relationship. Like the Pearson correlation, the Spearman correlation heatmap cannot be used for binary features; hence, it will be discussed in the Point-biserial correlation. A cross-examination between the Spearman and Pearson correlation matrices shows that the Spearman coefficient is higher in magnitude than the Pearson’s.\n\nLastly, the Point-biserial correlation is a special case of the Pearson correlation that can be applied when one variable is categorical with two categories, and the other data are continuous. As seen in Figure 8, the heatmap shows a positive correlation of 0.24 between the leeward side variable and the fraction of black pixels and a negative −0.24 for the windward side. Moreover, the leeward side is the only positive correlation observed, which indicates an increase in ember accumulation on the side of the structure that does not face the wind compared to the windward side.\n\n4.2. Model Evaluation\n\nThis section presents the model evaluation process. First, a visual comparison through a line plot, illustrating the model’s predictions versus actual outcomes, was applied to the full database to evaluate the overall predictive performance. Then, we utilized two evaluation metrics: R-squared (R2) and mean absolute error (MAE). These metrics were adopted to evaluate the model performance for predicting ember accumulation on roofs. Lastly, in addition to the full database, these metrics were implemented into the model to provide insight into the accuracy and precision of our model across the leeward and windward datasets.\n\n4.2.1. Full Database Model Performance\n\nFigure 9 visually illustrates the model’s prediction versus the actual outcome. As one can see, the model accurately predicted the fraction of ember coverage (represented by the black pixels). In addition, the R2 evaluation metric showed a value of 95.5%, which signifies a high level of accuracy. This indicates that the model can predict the fraction of black pixels within 95.5% of the original fraction of ember accumulation. Similarly, the MAE showed a 0.05 error, representing the average magnitude of the errors in the model’s predictions. This combination of a high R2 and a low MAE demonstrates the model’s robust predictive capability, making it a potentially valuable tool for applications requiring precise ember accumulation forecasts.\n\n4.2.2. Leeward and Windward Datasets\n\nThe model’s results varied when segmenting the database into two segments based on the side feature, whether the images were for the leeward or the windward roof section. On the leeward front, the R2 accuracy remained stable at around 93.4%, and the MAE dropped slightly to 0.050. Alternatively, the windward dataset’s R2 accuracy dropped to around 87.7%. In addition, the MAE evaluation showed an increase in error to 0.08.\n\nNotably, the training evaluation metrics followed a similar trend to the testing results, with the complete database dropping slightly, which can be explained by the considerable number of samples the model used for training. Table 3 tabulates the training and testing/validating evaluation metrics for the original database and the segmented datasets.\n\n4.2.3. SHAP Explainability Tools\n\nThe second goal of this study was to identify the impact of the selected parameters on roof ember accumulation by utilizing the SHAP explainability tool [42]. SHAP is a model-agnostic tool designed to provide an explainable layer to AI models, which are typically black boxes because users cannot observe how such models reached a prediction. SHAP offers a visual representation of how much each selected feature contributes to the model’s final prediction and the direction of its impact.\n\nMore specifically, such an explainability tool achieves both broad and detailed interpretations by calculating Shapley values, which consider every combination and interaction between features in the database rather than directly using the database features [58]. Shapley values are based on game theory, which requires two essential parts, namely, the ‘game’ and the ‘players’, where each player is a feature, and each game is a prediction. The ‘game’ represents the model’s outcome, while the players represent the database features. Shapley values quantify the impact of each player on the game, or in other words, each feature’s contribution to a prediction.\n\nIn regression models, to calculate the effect of a feature on prediction, Shapley values require training the model in all feature subsets S ⊆ F as shown in Table 4 [42]. To determine that specific feature effect, the f S ∪ i model is trained using that specific feature, and then another model f s is trained on another feature. Subsequently, based on the input, comparisons are to be made between predictions from the two associated models f S ∪ i x S ∪ i − f s ( x S ) . This comparison accounts for the fact that the impact of excluding a feature is influenced by the presence of other features in the model. Such differences are calculated for every subset of features, Shapley values are subsequently derived, and the average is taken and utilized as feature importance.\n\nSHAP generates a holistic (global) understanding and investigates the impact of each feature on the model’s target feature via SHAP summary plot. It is typically illustrated as a dot plot, where each point represents a Shapley value for a feature and an instance. Features are listed on the y-axis, arranged by their overall importance (usually determined by the sum of SHAP value magnitudes across all instances). The graph organizes these factors in descending order, starting with the most influential contributor and moving down to the least, according to their effect on the model’s output. The x-axis represents the Shapley values, indicating how each feature contributes to shifting the model output from the base point.\n\nMoreover, the summary plot added a new layer to determine the direction of the impact of the feature on the model prediction. The color coding of dots provides that additional layer where high feature values, represented by red dots, contribute to higher predictions. In addition, the density of the dots across the x-axis can also inform about the variability of a feature’s effect. A wide spread of dots across the Shapley values range indicates a significant impact on the prediction, while a narrow spread suggests a lower influence. This section demonstrates the results obtained from implementing the SHAP explainability tool by means of a summary plot into the DL model.\n\nFigure 10 shows that wind speed was the most critical feature contributing to the prediction, followed by the roof slope and wind angle. In addition, the windward and leeward categories were the lowest contributors to the predictions. On the color-coding front, all the top three influencing features showed that higher values [represented by the red dots] of these features contributed to decreasing the fraction of black pixels. Moreover, lower values [represented by blue dots] were associated with a higher accumulation of embers in the fraction of black pixels. This is consistent with the correlation coefficients data in Figure 6 and Figure 7, which show that all these parameters were negatively correlated with ember coverage.\n\nThe SHAP summary plots for the separated windward and leeward datasets are shown in Figure 11. A comparison of the two SHAP summary plots highlights some key differences between the ember retention on the windward and leeward sides of the rooftop. First, wind speed played the largest role in the model prediction for the windward side, followed by roof slope and wind angle. Moreover, the roof slope played the largest role for the leeward side, followed by wind speed and wind angle. This is consistent with the theory suggested in [28], which states that the flow separation along the eaves and roof ridge controls ember removal. For the roof’s leeward side, the flow structure was controlled by the flow separation along the ridge and was, therefore, significantly influenced by the roof slope at the ridgeline.\n\nA second interesting distinction is that the wind angle played a much larger role in the ember retention on the leeward side compared to the windward side. All but three SHAP values for the windward side range between ± 0.2 , whereas for the leeward side of the roof, the values range from −0.3 to +0.35. This is again consistent with the flow separation theory. The structure of the wind flow on the leeward side of the roof is controlled by the roof ridge angle and the wind angle relative to the ridge line. It is also worth noting that, on the windward side, many of the large wind angles (red dots) have positive SHAP values, whereas predominantly small wind angles (blue dots) have positive SHAP values. Again, this suggests that the retention process on the leeward side of the rooftop is qualitatively and quantitatively different. This is not clear from the summary model quality statistics presented in Table 3 and is only shown through a detailed analysis of the SHAP summary plots.\n\nThe results above demonstrate the power of this approach to quantify ember retention on rooftops during WUI fires and the value of XAI tools for elucidating behaviors that influence ember retention. However, there is more work needed before this tool can be of general use in home fire risk assessment. The limitations of the present study are as follows:\n\nThis work is limited to rectangular floor plan buildings with sloped gable end roofs and does not account for complex roof shapes. This is due, in part, to the lack of experimental data for non-rectangular roof buildings. Once building shapes beyond rectangular are considered, there is a significant increase in the number of parameters. For example, simply adding a T-shaped building introduces internal and external roof corners. There are geometric features that have only one dimension (length) and so much more work would need to be done to assess the influence area of such features. This would require a much larger dataset of non-rectangular buildings than is currently unavailable;\n\nIn general, complicating the roof types/shapes will increase the complexity of the DL model, which will dramatically increase the already significant computational resources required for training and testing;\n\nAlthough some explainability tools can be implemented in ANN to extract qualitative insights and verify domain knowledge, quantified interpretability remains a challenge. That is, the XAI data must still be interpreted with a domain expert to gain the full benefit of the analysis.\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nA DL model was used to develop a predictive model for identifying the fraction of a roof surface that is susceptible to ember accumulation during a WUI fire. The experimental data of [28] were used as the data source for both training and testing the developed model. The model was trained and tested on the full dataset and on subsets of the dataset to distinguish between the windward and leeward halves of the roof. Global measures of the quality of fit were used to assess the model performance. Both the R2 and MAE parameters showed very good performance for the model for both the full dataset and the two halves of the dataset analyzed separately.\n\nExplainability tools (XAI) were then applied to provide insights into the workings of the model. The SHAP summary plot for the entire dataset shows that the wind speed is the biggest contributor to the model prediction and, consistent with the Pearson and Spearman correlation heat maps in Figure 6 and Figure 7, the fraction of the rooftop on which embers are retained is negatively correlated with the magnitude of the wind speed. When the dataset was segmented into windward and leeward halves, the SHAP summary charts were qualitatively and quantitatively different. In particular, the wind angle plays a much larger role in ember retention on the leeward side of the rooftop. This is consistent with the theory that the flow structure is controlled by the flow separation along the eaves and roof ridge and, therefore, that the incident angle between the ridge and the wind is key to controlling ember retention. This suggests that the AI model is capturing some subtle features of the flow behavior and ember removal process.\n\nThe application of DL and XAI to ember accumulation provides both accurate quantitative predictions of the fraction of the rooftop on which embers can accumulate and insights into the mechanisms that allow embers to remain in contact with the roof surface. One drawback of the current study is that the dataset consists only of rectangular floor plan buildings with sloped gable end roofs. In the future, this work should be expanded to include more complex building floor plans and roof shapes. While limited experimental data in the literature [28] can be used to train and test such a model, the size of the datasets available would limit the accuracy of the model. Additional experiments are required to expand this dataset. Furthermore, work needs to be done to develop metrics for quantifying various roof features, such as dormer windows and internal corners, before they could be implemented into the model presented herein.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceptualization: N.B.K., M.K.A.-B., M.Z.N. and D.N.; Methodology M.Z.N. and M.K.A.-B.; Data curation: D.N.; Analysis: M.K.A.-B. and M.Z.N.; Resources: N.B.K.; Writing, review, and editing: N.B.K., M.K.A.-B., D.N. and M.Z.N.; Funding Acquisition: N.B.K.

    "# Gable: Comprehensive Analyst Report\n\n## Company Overview\n\nGable is a pioneering company in the data management space, specifically focusing on data contracts and proactive data quality management. Founded by Chad Sanderson, who previously worked at Convoy, Gable aims to bridge the gap between data producers and consumers by implementing data contracts early in the data lifecycle. This approach allows teams to draft, define, and enforce data contracts, fostering collaboration among software developers, data engineers, and data scientists [(5 Dang Good Data Lineage Tools, 2023)](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-lineage-tools).\n\nGable is positioned within the rapidly growing data catalog market, which is projected to expand from $878.8 million in 2023 to $4,680.9 million by 2032, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.7% [(5 Dang Good Data Lineage Tools, 2023)](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-lineage-tools). As a relatively new player in this market, Gable may face challenges in gaining traction compared to more established tools, but its unique focus on proactive data quality could differentiate it from competitors.\n\n## Product Overview\n\nGable's product is centered around its data contracts platform, which is designed to enhance data quality management by shifting the focus to the early stages of the data lifecycle. Unlike traditional data lineage tools, Gable's approach emphasizes defining and versioning data contracts, which provides visibility into data origins, transformations, and dependencies [(5 Dang Good Data Lineage Tools, 2023)](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-lineage-tools).\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **Proactive Data Quality Management**: Gable's platform allows teams to maintain data integrity early in the process, reducing costs and wasted effort associated with poor data quality.\n  \n- **Integration with Development Workflows**: Gable can integrate directly into existing development workflows, making it easier for teams to adopt and utilize the platform effectively.\n\n- **Visibility and Collaboration**: By defining data contracts, Gable fosters a collaborative environment where data producers and consumers can communicate expectations and responsibilities clearly.\n\n### Pros and Cons\n\n**Pros**:\n- Highly proactive approach to data quality.\n- Unique integration capabilities with development workflows.\n- Potential to reduce costs associated with data quality issues.\n\n**Cons**:\n- As a newcomer, Gable may present a learning curve compared to more established tools [(5 Dang Good Data Lineage Tools, 2023)](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-lineage-tools).\n\n### Pricing\n\nCurrently, Gable does not publicly disclose pricing information. Interested parties are encouraged to sign up for the product waitlist to receive updates on pricing and availability [(5 Dang Good Data Lineage Tools, 2023)](https://www.gable.ai/blog/data-lineage-tools).\n\n## Market Position and Competitors\n\nGable operates in a competitive landscape that includes established players like Alation, Collibra, and Secoda, each offering their own data lineage and governance solutions.
