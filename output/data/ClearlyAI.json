      "# [Halfway through YC](https://www.clearly-ai.com/blog/halfway-through-yc)\nWhat is Y Combinator?\n\nYCombinator (YC) is a 12-week startup accelerator program. YC runs in “batches” with the Summer 2024 (S24) running from July 8th to October 5th. The overall goal of YC is to accelerate the growth and progress of your startup. Group partners (former founders) mentor and guide approximately 250 companies each batch. I’ll dig deeper into why we decided to apply to YC in a future post, but for now, I want to highlight the key components of the first 6 weeks of YC.\n\nWhat happens during YC?\n\nBatch Retreat\n\nOur 3 days in Sonoma felt like college orientation meets summer camp. From grape stomping competitions to late-night fire pit chats to the incredibly powerful and vulnerable founder stories from our group partners Nicolas Dessaigne (Algolia), Andrew Miklas (PagerDuty), Tom Blomfield (Monzo), Nate Smith (Lever), Brad Flora (Perfect Audience), and Harj Taggar (Triplebyte), the batch retreat takes you from strangers to a bonded group (go Group 4!)\n\nFounder Stories\n\nYC is filled with events where we listened to behind-the-scenes stories and asked off-the-record questions with founders like Patrick Collison (Stripe), Sam Altman, Greg Brockman (Open AI), Andy Jassy (AWS), Brian Chesky (AirBNB), Aaron Levie (Box), Brian Armstrong (Coinbase), Howie Liu (Airtable), and of course Paul Graham and Jessica Livingston (Y Combinator). It's wild to go from an engineering job to being in the same room as some of the greatest founders.\n\nFounder-Led Sales\n\nFor most of us technical founders, we know how to build products, but have never had to sell them. WOW I have so much more admiration for enterprise AEs now! Sales & marketing are HARD. YC led a founder-led sales bootcamp where sales geniuses like Tracy Young (PlanGrid / TigerEye) and Ryan Neu (Vendr) shared key insights. This part of YC felt like a compressed business school for founders. I still have a ton to learn, but have gained a lot of wisdom from them and fellow YC founders.\n\nProduct Day\n\nLast week we had the chance to demo what we've built to other YC founders, and there's nothing like a big demo to push you to build bold features & functionality. Joe & I worked 16+ hour days for the past week to pull off a great demo, and we can't wait to show the world all of the new Clearly AI features.\n\nYC isn’t over yet!\n\nWith 6 weeks to go, there's so much left to accomplish at YC. But, I'm super proud of how far we've all come. Stay tuned for more company updates here and on my LinkedIn.\n\n‍",

      "# [Reviews, reviews, reviews!](https://www.clearly-ai.com/blog/reviews-explained)\nWhen we tell a Y Combinator batchmate that our company is “automating security and privacy reviews” the immediate answer we get back is “like SOC2?!” This makes sense - besides a fun Vanta billboard on the 101, SOC2 is often the first taste that startup founders get into the growing world of privacy, security, and compliance.\n\nIn this post, I’ll break down the types of reviews into three categories: (1) reviews of your company’s software; (2) reviews of your company’s overall posture; and (3) reviews of third party vendors (other company’s software) that integrate into your company or product.\n\nReviews of your company’s software\n\nSecurity Reviews\n\nSecurity reviews, often called “product security reviews” or “application security reviews” focus on the security of the software you’re developing to sell to other customers or use internally as part of your business. Most product security reviews consist of a few components:\n\nArchitecture review - understand the key components, infrastructure, and logic that makes up the product, and ensure it is secure by design. Architecture reviews typically include diagramming exercises like architecture diagrams and data flow diagrams.\n\nThreat modeling - the purpose of threat modeling is to think about the types of threats that could compromise the system and the controls in place to protect against them. It includes evaluating the network boundaries, assets, and actors. Folks often use a classic security framework like STRIDE.\n\nCode analysis - static code analysis tools (SAST), dynamic code analysis tools (DAST), and manual code reviews are used to ensure that the product was implemented as expected, and didn’t include vulnerabilities such as a lack of input validation or access control.\n\nSecurity testing - penetration testing, red teaming, and automated testing is sometimes incorporated for new products, risky products, or as part of CI/CD pipelines before deployment.\n\nPrivacy Reviews\n\nPrivacy teams also perform internal software reviews, such as “privacy by design reviews,” “privacy threshold analysis,” or “privacy impact assessments.” These reviews focus on privacy and compliance aspects like data handling, consent management, deletion, residency, and retention. Recently, many privacy teams have been tasked with AI Governance reviews as well. Privacy reviews normally include:\n\nDesign requirements - many privacy risks are inherent to a feature’s design, such as the type of data collected or the combination of data together. Design reviews look at the bigger-picture goals of the new product and ensure privacy principles are followed.\n\nData mapping - organizations need to map where all sensitive data is collected, processed, and stored. Data mapping exercises ensure that data is handled appropriately and allow the privacy team to evaluate each new data use case.\n\nRegulatory compliance - before launching a new product or feature, the privacy team must verify that compliance with applicable privacy regulations, such as GDPR or CCPA. These regulations each have nuances, but major product requirements include: supporting data subject access requests, data deletion, data retention requirements, and data residency requirements.\n\nReviews of your company’s overall posture\n\nOverall company security, often called “corporate security” or “IT security” includes the security of your company’s infrastructure (office network, company laptops) and your company’s security policies (like password policies or incident response policies). Reviews of your corporate security may include product security reviews as well, though these are usually focused on network exposure and surface-level penetration testing.\n\nCompliance (e.g., SOC2)\n\nAudits to determine if your company achieves certain compliance frameworks, such as SOC2, are focused on your company’s overall corporate security posture. Compliance certifications ensure that basic security controls are enabled, including access control policies, change management policies, and audit logging.\n\nFor more information about compliance reviews, I’d recommend any of the many compliance vendors, like Vanta or Drata. Remember, while these vendors help automate compliance readiness, most certifications are granted by auditors, such as the AICPA for SOC2.\n\nSecurity Questionnaires\n\nMost enterprise security questionnaires or RFPs focus on the overall posture of your company, as their biggest fear is a supply-chain attack, where an attacker compromises their network, product, or data via their vendor. Security questionnaires normally include:\n\nOverall corporate security - enterprises will often ask for your internal security policies, any compliance reports you may have, and information about your incident response processes like timely breach notifications.\n\nData handling and integrations - enterprises are very sensitive to the types of data you will handle as their vendor, and how you will integrate into their other systems. More sensitive data or integrations will require higher levels of due diligence.\n\nAvailable controls - enterprises often ask for higher security controls than smaller companies, including data segregation via single-tenancy, network segregation (private cloud or on-prem), and managed authentication (SSO).\n\nAI policies - increasingly, AI governance and usage have become a key component in security questionnaires. Enterprises are adverse to any AI companies training collective models using their data.\n\nReviews of your third party vendors\n\nJust as enterprises must review you for security compliance, you are also responsible for reviewing your third party vendors. We recommend reviewing all vendors that will have access to your corporate network, will handle sensitive employee data, or will be a subprocessor (a handler of customer data). You can review vendors holistically for security, privacy, and compliance via a Vendor Risk Assessment.\n\nVendor Security Reviews\n\nWe recommend performing the same, or even a higher level of due diligence on your vendors as you would on any internal software you develop. Hold your vendors to as high a standard as possible, especially if they will handle personal, customer, or employee data. When performing a vendor security review, request access to the company’s trust center. Trust Centers should include an overview of the company’s architecture, key security controls, and any audits performed, including compliance certifications or penetration tests. Often with a vendor security review, you may not have sufficient visibility. We recommend asking deep and pointed follow-up questions to their team instead of sending a long vendor security questionnaire.\n\nVendor Privacy Reviews\n\nIf you provide any of your customer’s or employee’s data to a vendor as a subprocessor, you are responsible for that data. In GDPR, your company would be the “Data Controller” and subject to a higher level of scrutiny than a “Data Processor.” As the Data Controller, you have the overall responsibility to protect the personal data you receive. Performing vendor privacy reviews allows you to ensure your vendors comply with privacy regulations.\n\nFeeling overwhelmed by all the reviews?\n\nAt Clearly AI, we believe all reviews should happen in one place, with the same tooling. Reach out to our team for help structuring your security and privacy review processes.\n\n‍"

      "# [Companies – Ritual Capital](https://ritualcapital.com/companies/)\nAgentive: Revolutionizing Auditing with AI\n\nAuditing is a critical function in the business world, ensuring financial accuracy and compliance. Yet, it’s often bogged down by manual processes and time-consuming tasks. Agentive’s AI workspace streamlines these routine tasks, from audit planning, client requests, testing procedures, and documentation.\n\nThe founding team is built for this opportunity. Danny Alberson’s background as an auditor at Ernst & Young and product manager at Facebook gives him firsthand knowledge of the challenges auditors face and how to build products to solve them. Meanwhile, Jason Draper’s experience as the CTO of Fairquote and Nathan Turnbow’s experience from Imagine Learning and Dell provide the technical expertise to build the platform.\n\nThe potential impact of Agentive extends far beyond individual auditors or firms. By increasing the efficiency and accuracy of audits, Agentive has the power to enhance trust in financial reporting across the board.\n\nAgentive is now taking a significant step forward by revolutionizing document requests, a process that has long been a source of frustration for both auditors and clients. The current state of document requests often involves confusing interfaces, unorganized sample requests, and time-consuming reviews, leading to strained relationships and re-work.\n\nClients struggle with confusing request platforms and unorganized document lists, leading to miscommunication, mistakes, and re-work. Auditors spend days reviewing files, matching documents, and handling missing or incorrect evidence. Constant follow-ups strain relationships, wasting time and leaving both clients and auditors frustrated.\n\nAgentive streamlines the document request process with an intuitive engagement board, real-time tracking, and drag-and-drop updates. Native sample tables replace Excel, enabling direct evidence attachment. Automated matching and instant citations cut review time by 90%, while a secure portal simplifies uploads, eliminating email clutter and outdated systems.\n\nDelivering a delightful document request experience is just the beginning. Agentive is set to launch AI-drafted audit procedures that run automatically when a client completes a request. Their vision is to vertically integrate and elevate the entire audit process with AI, making audits smoother, more efficient, and more enjoyable for everyone involved.\n\nWe see Agentive playing a pivotal role in shaping the auditing industry. A world where AI and human expertise work in tandem, where auditors are empowered to provide more value than ever before, and where financial transparency becomes the norm, not the exception.\n\nVisit their site.\n\nAlex: Building the AI Bridge for iOS Development\n\nThe way we build software is changing again. Just as cloud computing transformed development practices a decade ago, AI is reshaping how we write code today. That’s why we’re investing in Alex, an AI-powered development tool that’s bringing intelligent assistance directly into Xcode.\n\nAlex tackles a clear problem in iOS development: the gap between generic AI coding tools and the specific needs of Apple platform developers. By integrating deeply with Xcode through MacOS’s accessibility features, Alex provides contextually aware assistance that actually understands iOS development patterns and Apple’s frameworks.\n\nThe numbers speak for themselves – over 1,200 active users adopted Alex in its first week. Engineers from aircraft navigation companies to major online marketplaces are already incorporating it into their daily workflow. What’s compelling isn’t just the adoption rate, but how Alex is becoming an essential part of developers’ coding process.\n\nAt the helm of this innovative venture is Daniel Edrisian, a visionary founder with a proven track record in iOS development. Daniel’s experience as a founding engineer at FlutterFlow and his work on the iOS app for ElevenLabs have given him a unique understanding of the challenges faced by iOS developers. His internships at tech giants like Apple, Meta, and Google have also equipped him with a broad perspective on the tech industry’s evolving landscape. Daniel’s passion for creating tools that enhance developer productivity is evident in Alex’s design and functionality.\n\nThis investment feels familiar. At Ritual Capital, we’ve had the privilege of backing transformative developer tools before. Our early investments in Parse and Heroku came at similar inflection points. Heroku bridged the gap between developers and cloud infrastructure, while Parse revolutionized backend services for mobile development. Now, as AI creates another fundamental shift in how we build software, developers need tools that bridge the gap between AI capabilities and mobile development workflows. Alex is building that bridge for iOS.\n\nWhat sets Alex apart is its focused approach. Instead of trying to be everything for everyone, the team is building specialized iOS-focused language models trained on Apple’s documentation. They’re creating a local development agent that handles background tasks like refactoring, testing, and documentation – allowing developers to focus on building features that matter.\n\nThe team’s roadmap is clear and ambitious: build the tools that make AI truly useful for iOS development. We’re excited to partner with them as they execute on this vision and help shape the future of how we build software for Apple platforms.

Anthrogen, a San Francisco-based startup, has engineered the fastest photosynthesizing organism ever known to exist. Their breakthrough? Using these supercharged microbes and AI-designed enzymes to transform atmospheric CO2 into valuable chemicals using nothing but sunlight.\n\nThe company recently secured $4 million in funding to accelerate their vision of creating affordable, carbon-negative chemicals. This isn’t just another green technology – it’s a fundamental reimagining of how we produce the building blocks of modern life.\n\nWhat sets Anthrogen apart is their unified platform that combines AI-engineered enzymes with these remarkable microbes. Their system optimizes chemical reactions in ways previously thought impossible, creating a production process that runs primarily on sunlight instead of electricity (often the costliest part of standard “e-fuel” operations). The implications are staggering: chemicals that don’t just reduce carbon emissions but actively remove CO2 from the atmosphere while remaining cost-competitive with fossil fuel alternatives.\n\nThe founding team brings together an exceptional blend of expertise. Led by CEO Ankit Singhal, alongside Connor Lee and Vignesh Karthik, these Columbia University alumni combine deep knowledge in biophysics, robotics, and geology. Their approach to solving complex enzymatic challenges with AI demonstrates the kind of innovative thinking that defines category-creating companies.\n\nInitially focused on carbon capture, Anthrogen has expanded their vision to include recombinant protein expression and generative protein models. Their technology can produce everything from jet fuel to industrial polymers, all while consuming CO2 rather than creating it.\n\nThe challenge of using atmospheric CO2 as a feedstock has always been its stability and low concentration. Anthrogen’s breakthrough lies in their AI models, which design specialized enzymes that actively capture CO2 and transform it through an optimized pathway into valuable chemicals.\n\nThis is why we invested. In a world desperate for scalable climate solutions, Anthrogen isn’t just offering incremental improvements – they’re fundamentally transforming chemical manufacturing. They’re proving that environmental sustainability and economic viability aren’t mutually exclusive. They’re showing us that the future of chemistry isn’t found in oil wells, but in the elegant folds of novel enzymes , powered by sunlight and guided by artificial intelligence.\n\nThe road ahead is long, but the potential is boundless. This is more than an investment in a company – it’s an investment in a future where chemistry works in harmony with our planet, not against it.\n\nThat’s the kind of future worth building.\n\nVisit their site.\n\nCaladan Bio: Unleashing the Power of Synthetic Biology\n\nIn a nondescript Brooklyn lab, a small team is changing the future of biotechnology.

Since launch, Maple has seen exceptional growth, with families reporting up to 80% reduction in planning time and a 65% decrease in missed activities and appointments. These aren’t just statistics – they represent real hours given back to families, real stress eliminated from parents’ lives, and real improvements in household harmony.\n\nWhat particularly excited us about Maple was their vision for the future of family technology. The team isn’t just solving today’s problems; they’re anticipating tomorrow’s challenges. Their innovative browser-based approach, which seamlessly integrates with existing family workflows, demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of how technology should adapt to users, not the other way around.\n\nThe market opportunity here is massive. With over 33 million families in the US alone juggling multiple children, activities, and household responsibilities, the demand for intelligent family organization solutions has never been higher. Maple’s rapid adoption rates and impressive user retention metrics suggest they’ve struck a chord with their target market.\n\nBut beyond the market opportunity, what truly convinced us to invest was the team’s commitment to building technology that strengthens family bonds rather than replacing them. In a world where screen time often comes at the expense of face-to-face interaction, Maple is using technology to facilitate more quality time together.\n\nThe platform’s emphasis on collaborative planning and shared responsibility also reflects a modern understanding of family dynamics. Whether it’s coordinating with caregivers, managing multiple schedules, or ensuring everyone stays on the same page, Maple has created a solution that adapts to various family structures and needs.\n\nLooking ahead, we see Maple becoming the essential platform for family organization, much like Slack has become for workplace communication or Shopify for e-commerce. The company’s robust product roadmap, combined with their deep understanding of user needs, positions them perfectly to capture this growing market.\n\nOur investment in Maple represents more than just backing a promising startup – it’s an investment in the future of family life. As we continue to support their journey, we’re excited to see how Maple will transform the way families organize, communicate, and spend time together.\n\nThe challenge of family organization might not be the most glamorous problem in tech, but it’s arguably one of the most important. By giving families back their time and reducing the mental load of household management, Maple isn’t just building a successful business – they’re making a meaningful impact on people’s daily lives. And that’s exactly the kind of innovation we love to support at Ritual Capital.\n\nVisit their site.\n\nOutset AI: The New Frontier of Qualitative Research\n\nIn the relentless pursuit of innovation, we’re always on the lookout for game-changers.

The result is a solution that reduces administrative overhead while providing the data-driven insights firms need to make strategic decisions about pricing, staffing, and profitability.\n\nThe timing is critical. As the industry shifts toward a mix of billing models – from traditional hourly billing to fixed fees, caps, estimates, and subscriptions – firms need sophisticated tools to navigate this complexity. Without granular understanding of their work and activities, firms can’t accurately price projects, understand margins, or adapt to shifting client demands.\n\nThis vision has gained significant market validation. The company’s recent $3.5M seed round attracted investment from leading firms including Bessemer Venture Partners, 8VC, General Catalyst, and Y Combinator, along with strategic investment from a Cooley-affiliated fund and several of their customers. This broad support signals the market’s recognition that law firms need to become data-driven organizations to thrive in the future.\n\nAt Ritual Capital, we invest in founders who combine deep domain expertise with technical innovation to solve fundamental business challenges. PointOne exemplifies this approach. They’re not just automating manual processes – they’re building the infrastructure that will enable law firms to make more intelligent decisions about their operations and adapt to evolving client demands.\n\nThe future of legal practice will require firms to have a nuanced understanding of all work performed for clients, much like how software companies track every user interaction. PointOne is building the platform to make this transition possible, allowing firms to focus on high-value work while gaining the insights needed to operate more effectively in a changing market.\n\nVisit their site.\n\nPromptArmor: Securing the Future of AI Innovation\n\nPicture this: A world where AI applications are as secure as they are powerful.

A subtle shift in how things are done. A smarter way to solve an old problem. That’s exactly what drew us to Risotto.\n\nThe IT support industry has been dominated by the same players for decades. ServiceNow, Zoho, and Spiceworks have built empires on complex platforms that require training, maintenance, and constant hand-holding. They’re the kings of the castle, comfortable in their position, perhaps too comfortable.\n\nEnter Risotto. While the incumbents weren’t looking, this team quietly built something revolutionary: an AI-powered IT help desk that lives entirely in Slack. No new apps. No portals. No training. It’s the kind of elegant solution that makes you wonder why nobody thought of it before.\n\nThe genius is in its simplicity. Risotto slips into organizations through the side door – Slack – where employees already spend their days. It’s a Trojan horse strategy that bypasses the traditional enterprise sales cycle entirely. By the time the incumbent players realize what’s happening, Risotto will already be the de facto IT support solution for thousands of companies.\n\nBut this isn’t just about clever distribution. Risotto’s AI engine is a beast, automatically resolving up to 60% of support tickets without human intervention. Every interaction makes it smarter, creating a growing intelligence gap that legacy players can’t bridge with their bolt-on AI features. It’s like watching a Tesla race a Model T – there’s just no comparison.\n\nThe team behind Risotto – Aron Solberg, Alex Confer, and Chris Paul – bring experience at companies like Dropbox, Gusto, HelloSign, and Square, where they’ve seen firsthand how broken traditional IT support is. They’re not outsiders trying to solve a problem they don’t understand – they’ve lived it, breathed it, and now they’re fixing it.\n\nWhat excites us most is how Risotto is positioning itself for the long game. Starting with IT support is just the beginning. As they build trust and prove their value, they’ll naturally expand into broader enterprise service management. It’s the classic disruptor’s playbook, executed with precision.\n\nThat’s why we’re betting on Risotto. The future of IT support isn’t another clunky platform or a complicated workflow. It’s a simple, intelligent conversation in Slack. And Risotto is leading the way. Sometimes the biggest disruptions don’t announce themselves with fanfare – they slip in quietly through the side door and take over from within.\n\nVisit their site.\n\nRunLocal: Solving the Last Mile Problem in AI Deployment\n\nWhile tech giants battle over the next breakthrough in AI models, a critical challenge lurks beneath the surface: getting AI to work effectively on the devices we use every day. That’s where RunLocal comes in, on a mission to make on-device AI development accessible and efficient.\n\nThe challenge of deploying AI models on diverse devices – from phones to laptops – has become a significant hurdle for engineering teams. What works flawlessly in the lab often falls apart in the real world, where different hardware specifications and operating systems create a maze of compatibility issues. RunLocal is solving this by providing a comprehensive platform that allows teams to test, optimize, and confidently deploy AI models across a wide range of devices.\n\nFounded by Ismail Salim, Ivan Chan and Ciaran O’Rourke, RunLocal emerged from their firsthand experience with the limitations of existing on-device AI tooling. The founders’ background, including Ivan’s work on Marshall Wace’s internal server-side AI platform, and Ismail/Ciaran’s early insight into the challenges of on-device AI development while working together on the first AI video codec at Deep Render, gave them unique insights into the gap between server-side and on-device AI development.\n\nThe platform’s approach is refreshingly practical. Instead of forcing developers to maintain their own device testing infrastructure, RunLocal provides a streamlined solution that can reduce model conversion and optimization time from weeks to days. This isn’t just about speed – it’s about giving engineers the confidence that their AI models will perform consistently across different hardware and operating systems.\n\nWhat particularly caught our attention was RunLocal’s focus on real-world performance metrics.

RunLocal is building the essential infrastructure to make this possible, and we’re thrilled to be part of their journey.\n\nVisit their site.\n\nSchematic: Launch and monetize features, end-to-end\n\nFeature monetization has long been an afterthought in SaaS, but it shouldn’t be. Every great company starts with a simple truth: SaaS pricing and packaging should be a growth lever, not a bottleneck.\n\nYet for most companies, pricing is stuck in code. Teams know they need to experiment—launch trials, bundle and unbundle, manage usage limits, and iterate on packaging. But every change requires an engineering sprint, every tweak introduces instability, and most features ship without a clear monetization plan. The result? A disconnect between product development and revenue growth.\n\nSchematic is changing that. They’re not just building another tool—they’re unleashing the next wave of SaaS innovation. The world’s best software companies are held back by their own pricing infrastructure. Engineers spend precious time maintaining billing code instead of building products their customers love. Schematic demolishes this complexity with brutal efficiency. A few lines of code, and suddenly, you can launch any pricing model, track any usage metric, and create any package—no engineering sprints, no technical debt, no compromises.\n\nThe team behind Schematic knows this pain firsthand. Fynn, Benjamin, and Giovanni have lived it at companies like Automox and Relay Payments. They’ve felt the frustration of watching great ideas die on the vine because pricing infrastructure couldn’t keep up. Now, they’re doing something about it. They’ve built a platform that allows SaaS companies to move at the speed of their imagination, enabling product teams to launch new features without waiting for billing to catch up and freeing engineering resources to focus on innovation, not maintenance.\n\nThe market is massive—$30 billion and growing—but the real opportunity is even bigger. This isn’t just about making life easier for software companies; it’s about unleashing innovation. When you remove the constraints of legacy billing systems, you open the door to new business models, new customer experiences, and new ways of delivering value.\n\nEarly adopters are already feeling the impact. Companies that once spent months building pricing systems are now doing it in days. Teams that were stuck with rigid pricing models are now experimenting freely. Revenue that was left on the table is now flowing to the bottom line. As one founder put it: “It’s extremely unlikely that a product’s optimal pricing will be obvious from the start. And even less likely that what works today will still be optimal six months from now. As product teams, we’re shipping new value constantly, but we’re not monetizing it. Every time we want to iterate with pricing & packaging, we have a really bad tradeoff to reconcile: pull developers off of shipping new features and onto the pricing initiative, or keep shipping. It’s crazy if you think about it.”\n\nAnother Schematic customer described how the platform changed their perspective on feature monetization, “Schematic taught us to think in terms of features we will monetize. Before, we would ship new things and just use flags to turn them on. But now, ‘off’ isn’t just ‘hidden’—it’s an upgrade opportunity. ‘Off’ means ‘Upgrade to access,’ or ‘You’ve reached your limit,’ or ‘Time to renew.’”\n\nSchematic extends feature management beyond deployment, integrating it with monetization strategies. This means product teams can launch, test, and iterate on features without requiring code changes. They can bundle and unbundle offerings dynamically and connect feature access directly to billing systems. What excites us most about Schematic is how it enables a single product developer to drive these changes in real-time, without waiting for an engineering cycle.\n\nThe most successful SaaS companies already think this way, but until now, they’ve had to build these systems internally. Schematic is doing for SaaS pricing what Stripe did for payments—taking something complex, messy, and time-consuming and making it simple, elegant, and powerful.\n\nThat’s why we invested. Because pricing and packaging should be a growth lever, not a bottleneck. Because developers shouldn’t have to reinvent feature pricing infrastructure from scratch. And because the future of SaaS isn’t just about shipping features—it’s about monetizing them effectively from day one.\n\nVisit their site.\n\nStack Auth: The Open-Source Future of User Management\n\nAuthentication has long been a pain point in software development. While solutions like Auth0 and Clerk dominate the market, their closed-source nature and vendor lock-in have created friction for development teams seeking more control and flexibility. This is what drew our attention to Stack Auth, an open-source authentication platform that takes a fundamentally different approach.\n\nStack Auth addresses a clear market gap. Most development teams face a difficult choice: either invest significant resources building authentication in-house, with all the security risks that entails, or accept the limitations of proprietary solutions. Stack Auth offers a third path – enterprise-grade authentication that’s both open source and production-ready.\n\nThe technical architecture reflects deep consideration of real-world development needs. The platform provides essential features like password-based authentication and SSO, while also supporting more complex requirements such as team management and role-based access control. Its integration with Next.js and handling of OAuth tokens for third-party services demonstrate an understanding of modern application architectures.\n\nWhat sets Stack Auth apart is its pragmatic approach to security and customization. The open-source codebase allows for complete transparency and auditability, while the platform’s design enables developers to modify and extend functionality without sacrificing security. For teams that require it, self-hosting options provide additional control over data and infrastructure.\n\nThe market timing is notable. As applications become more complex and data privacy concerns intensify, the demand for flexible, transparent authentication solutions is growing. Stack Auth’s architecture is well-suited for emerging use cases in AI and machine learning applications, where fine-grained access control and third-party integrations are crucial.\n\nOur investment in Stack Auth reflects our conviction that authentication infrastructure is due for a significant shift. The movement toward open-source solutions in critical infrastructure components continues to accelerate, and authentication is a natural next step in this evolution.\n\nThe authentication space has remained relatively unchanged for years, despite significant evolution in other areas of the development stack. Stack Auth’s approach to opening up this layer of infrastructure, while maintaining enterprise-grade security and usability, positions it well to capture the growing demand for more flexible authentication solutions.\n\nVisit their site.\n\nStepChange: Performance at Scale, Simplified\n\nIn the evolving landscape of modern engineering, where every dollar spent on infrastructure must deliver results, StepChange is rewriting the rules.

Remote work and outdated hiring tech have only made the process harder, yet talent teams are still expected to do more with less. That’s where Tofu comes in—revolutionizing how fast-growing companies screen, qualify, and hire top talent using AI.\n\nWe met founders Jason Zoltak and Jonathan Perez a year into their journey—after they had already bootstrapped their way to 100+ customers as a two-person team. Inspired by Jason’s experience at Shiftsmart, where he saw firsthand the inefficiencies in hiring, they left their jobs to build Tofu with a clear mission: eliminate the 25 million hours wasted annually on inefficient recruiting. Their resourcefulness and vision made it clear—they were founders we wanted to back.\n\nToronto-based Tofu has built an AI-first hiring platform that’s already helping 170+ companies streamline recruitment. At its core, Tofu solves the most time-consuming part of hiring: screening candidates at scale. Its AI can review 1,000 profiles in 60 seconds with 96% accuracy, cutting application review time by up to 83%.\n\nBut Tofu goes beyond just screening—it customizes AI resume review agents to match each company’s hiring needs. These agents learn from **ideal candidate profiles and past successful hires, ensuring that hiring decisions align with a company’s unique requirements and culture. The result? Higher-quality candidates and dramatically faster hiring.\n\nTofu transforms standard applicant tracking systems into live, searchable talent databases enriched with insights beyond the resume. It even validates applicants to prevent fraudulent submissions, ensuring recruiters engage only with genuine candidates.\n\nThe platform’s impact speaks for itself:\n\n– Recruiters save at least 3 hours per week on screening.\n\n– Companies using Tofu have cut staffing costs by over 70% by automating repetitive tasks.\n\nThis traction has attracted leading investors, securing a $1.2M pre-seed round from Night Capital, Garage Capital, Wayfinder Ventures, and Ritual Capital.\n\nTofu isn’t stopping at screening. Their upcoming AI Silver Medalist Resurfacing will help companies rediscover top candidates from past hiring cycles, while AI-powered outbound sourcing will proactively identify talent for open roles. And with a growing network of talent moving through customer funnels, Tofu is building a recruitment engine that connects top candidates across companies.\n\nHiring is no longer just about filling roles—it’s about finding the right people, faster and smarter. Tofu is leading this shift, combining cutting-edge AI with deep hiring insights to help companies build stronger teams with less effort.\n\nVisit their site."
