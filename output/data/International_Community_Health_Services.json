      "# [HAWC by efelle creative](https://www.ichs.com/hawc)\nICHS is expanding senior services in King County with the new Ron Chew Healthy Aging and Wellness Center, (formerly called AiPACE) to serve hundreds more low income seniors. This program is modeled after the success of the innovative ICHS PACE (Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly) Center launched in 2019 at our Legacy House location in the Chinatown-International District. The new facility will quadruple the number of vulnerable older adults served, demonstrating the need for elder services in our area.\n\nCommunity support has been instrumental in helping us reach 50 percent of our $25 million capital campaign goal now underway to build the 25,000-square-foot senior center and clinic. The new center will deliver comprehensive, affordable wraparound services, maximize quality of life for families, and keep our community healthy by meeting individual patients' healthcare needs in one place. ICHS Foundation Executive Director Alice Braverman thanks the community for the support to date.\n\nPledges\n\nCampaign pledges can be paid over a period of five years.\n\nEstate/Planned Giving\n\nBequests or other planned giving gifts provide tax benefits and may be a practical way to support.\n\nGifts of Securities\n\nA donation of appreciated securities may provide tax advantages while benefiting people in need of healthcare.\n\nLife Insurance\n\nGifting an existing life insurance policy to ICHS also a way to support this campaign.\n\nNaming Opportunities\n\nICHS offers a range of naming opportunities in the new center which provide prominent recognition for significant campaign gifts. For more information, please contact us.\n\nWhat is PACE?\n\nPACE is a nationally-recognized model of care that enables low-income, nursing-home eligible adults age 55 and older to live independently at home or in the community. The program provides all the care and services covered by Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nComprehensive medical and social services coordinated and provided by an interdisciplinary team of professionals in a community-based center and in their homes, helping program participants delay or avoid long-term nursing home care. Each PACE participant receives customized care that is planned and delivered by a coordinated, interdisciplinary team of professionals working at the center. The team meets regularly with each participant and his or her representative in order to assess the participant's needs. A participant's care plan usually integrates some home care services from the team with several visits each week to the PACE center, which serves as the hub for medical care, rehabilitation, social activities, and dining.\n\nFor more information or to become involved, contact Christine Consolacion.",

      "# [Referrals by efelle creative](https://www.ichs.com/referrals)\nWhat is a referral?\n\nA referral is a formal way your ICHS provider can send you to a specialty clinic or imaging service. Think of it as your doctor introducing you to their trusted colleague who is an expert in another area of medicine, like cardiology.\n\nIt is important to go to your referral appointments because ICHS clinics do not have all the resources and equipment necessary to help you with all your care needs. If you miss your referral appointment, your ICHS provider will not have all the information needed to help you.\n\nSome patients are understandably worried about seeking care in an unfamiliar place. But you don’t need to be! ICHS will only refer you to trusted clinics and hospitals. These other doctors will automatically send notes to your provider so that they stay up-to-date about your care.\n\nI got a referral. Now what?\n\nThis is what happens behind the scenes and what you need to do:",
      "# [History by efelle creative](https://www.ichs.com/history)\nToday, ICHS provides care to thousands of patients each year in 10 locations throughout the region, but its journey started in very humble circumstances five decades ago. ICHS’ history is a story of the love, caring, commitment and compassion that residents have for their community and for each other.\n\nIn the early 1970s, low-income Asian immigrants in Seattle’s Chinatown had no options when they needed a doctor who spoke their language. The Pioneer Square Neighborhood Health Station was the only community clinic in the area but it was too far for many elderly Chinese and Filipinos to reach by foot.\n\nWith the construction of Interstate 5 in the 1960s, and the Kingdome stadium threatening to uproot homes and businesses in the area in the 1970s, Chinatown seemed like an unlikely place to launch a medical practice. But in 1973, a group of dedicated community advocates, including Sister Heide Parreño, Bruce Miyahara, Bob Santos and many others, brought culturally-appropriate medical services close to the neighborhood.\n\nDr. Eugene Ko, who owned the Jefferson Park Clinic in Beacon Hill, donated space for the advocates to establish the Asian Community Health Clinic. It would become the site for in-language health care for mainly elderly Chinese and Filipino patients living in surrounding area single room occupancy hotels. Volunteer doctors, interpreters and mental health staff operated the Asian Community Health Clinic from the Jefferson Park Clinic on Tuesday nights and eventually on Saturday mornings.\n\nIn 1975, the Asian Community Health Clinic moved to Chinatown — and the International District (ID) Community Health Center was born. The ID Clinic, as many still call it, was the first of its kind in the nation to serve a diverse Asian population at one location.\n\nIn 1996, the ID Clinic expanded to South Seattle. The clinic took on a new name — International Community Health Services (ICHS) — to reflect a second location, the Holly Park Medical & Dental Clinic, and the increasing diversity of patients.\n\nThe Holly Park site quickly drew more patients. By 2003, ICHS realized the need for a larger facility. The construction of light rail forced an early move for the clinic. In early 2005, ICHS opened the doors to its new Holly Park clinic on South Othello Street, blocks from the old location.\n\nSince then, the number of patients has grown, especially during the Great Recession. The Puget Sound region’s diversity has soared. ICHS reflects that. Each year, ICHS offers quality and affordable services — including medical, dental, vision, behavioral health, pharmacy, outreach and healthy living assistance — in more than 70 languages and dialects.\n\nIn 2014, ICHS experienced unprecedented growth as it opened the Bellevue Medical and Dental Clinic in the populous Crossroads neighborhood, and the Shoreline Medical and Dental along the busy Aurora Avenue corridor. The opening of Bellevue and Shoreline medical and dental clinics culminated a years-long planning that started with a 2006 Community Needs Assessment and a series of feasibility studies to effectively gauge and serve the area’s need.\n\nThe ICHS Vision Clinic opened in 2017. Located in the ID medical-dental building, it effectively extended ICHS’ scope of care to provide low-income patients, as well as other members of the community, with culturally and linguistically appropriate eye care services.\n\nOn March 1, 2019, ICHS officially took over the operation of Legacy House from the Seattle Chinatown/International District Preservation and Development Authority (SCIDpda). Legacy House is one of only two assisted-living facilities in Seattle with an emphasis on serving multi-Asian clientele, drawing residents and participants from beyond the neighborhood. ICHS provides all Legacy House services — including assisted living with 75 units, adult day care and a congregate meal program — as part of a comprehensive Healthy Aging and Wellness Program (HAWP).",

It helps us all do our part to limit community transmission of COVID-19. You can schedule either a telephone visit or a virtual visit.\n\nA telephone visit lets you share a conversation with your provider over a phone line.\n\nA virtual visit takes place face-to-face through live video with your primary care clinician, dentist or behavioral health provider. A virtual visit requires an internet connection and a computer, tablet or smartphone equipped with a camera, microphone and speaker.\n\nSometimes, it may be necessary for you to be seen in the clinic. If your care team determines this is the best way to address your care, they will let you know.

She is number three out of four sisters. Jessica’s parents immigrated to Seattle during the Vietnam War and she grew up seeing them work multiple jobs, struggle to learn the English language, and navigate the new culture. She believes it’s an incredible privilege to have an education and be in a position where she can positively influence the health of others.\n\nJessica has been a volunteer in hospitals, nursing assistant in an adult family home, medical assistant in urgent care, and a nurse at Overlake Hospital for three-and-one-half years. With the experience she has had, she has always had a directional pull toward community health. Her hope is to elevate health outcomes of patient populations with less access to care or those with a lower socioeconomic status. Her ultimate goal is to also diminish the inequalities that currently exist in the health care system.\n\nIn Jessica’s spare time, she loves to play basketball, volleyball, hike, eat ice cream, dog sit for friends and family, listen to Taylor Swift, and go razor clamming. She currently lives in Madison Valley, and her favorite restaurants are Shiro’s and Rondo.\n\nMorgan H. Lu, BSN, RN\n\nAs a Family Nurse Practitioner, Morgan strives to embody the essence of compassionate and equitable health care for all. With a strong belief in health care as a fundamental human right, she has made it her life's mission to ensure that every individual receives access to quality health care services. Morgan brings a unique perspective to her practice as a third-generation immigrant, combining her cross cultural upbringing with a deep sense of empathy and understanding. Drawing from her experiences, she has advocated for equitable health care, recognizing the intersection of cultural diversity and medical care. With a diverse background that includes working as an RN in both emergency and oncologic medicine, Morgan has developed a deep understanding of the importance of preventive and holistic care. She strives to empower patients to take control of their health and well-being through comprehensive and sustainable practices.\n\nBeyond her clinical expertise, Morgan is passionate about fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion within the health care field. She has spearheaded programs aimed at training health care professionals to embrace and understand the unique needs of diverse populations and the inequities that plague our current systems. Her commitment extends to community outreach, where she has facilitated DEI trainings amongst the general public. Morgan has also served as a member of the statewide information and education committee for reproductive health services in Wyoming, where she has improved access and educational materials for individuals seeking reproductive services. She has also lent her expertise to volunteer efforts at free clinics, reaffirming her desire to work alongside marginalized and underserved populations.\n\nBeyond work, Morgan is married to her husband, Zach, and is originally from the Colorado/Wyoming area.

Sarah loved fishing in the Potomac River, eating crab legs, and doing karaoke with her cousins at the family gatherings in her grandparents’ home.\n\nAfter receiving her B.A. in biology and cognitive science from the University of Virginia in 2015, Sarah moved to Seattle, where she found a passion for community health and working with adolescents. Through her work in local school-based health centers, Sarah became invested in preventive health care, sexual health education, reproductive justice, and a commitment to building the strength and resilience of the community. After working with a group of wonderful nurse practitioners in the school-based program, Sarah decided to become a nurse practitioner herself.

Growing up in an immigrant household, challenges with access to health care and resources, paired with language/cultural barriers, low health literacy, and financial burdens, made health care seem more like a luxury than a necessity. This created a passion within Yoon to help others struggling to access and achieve good health.\n\nYoon has a bachelor’s degree in psychology from the University of Washington and has worked in research and other health care positions before becoming a nurse in 2019 from the University of Hawaii. She has worked as a school nurse for children with medical needs and as part of the University of Hawaii’s COVID-19 Response Team during the pandemic. She received her doctorate in nursing practice degree from the University of Hawaii in 2022. Yoon strongly believes in empowering patients through education and preventive medicine. Her DNP project found that delivering culturally appropriate diabetes education classes improved self-efficacy and self-management capabilities in diabetic patients. She hopes to continue to learn more about ways to empower patients and improve health outcomes through participation in the ICHS APP Post Graduate Training program.\n\nYoon loves to spend time with family and friends. In her spare time, she loves to read, go for scenic walks, listen to podcasts, and sing in the car.

      "# [Medical Residency by efelle creative](https://www.ichs.com/medical-residency)\nMessage from the site director\n\nThank you for your interest in becoming a family medicine resident physician, and a part of our family at International Community Health Services (ICHS). ICHS and the Swedish Family Medicine Residency at Cherry Hill share the same goal: to train and inspire the next generation of family physicians to provide evidence-based, quality health care to underserved, economically disadvantaged, culturally diverse, and disenfranchised communities. Each year, we accept two residents for our site for a 2-2-2 residency.\n\nThe ICHS Family Medicine Site is in the heart of downtown Seattle’s historic Chinatown-International District (CID) and Little Saigon. In 1973, a small group of community members, physicians, and medical students created a free health clinic in a borrowed space in Beacon Hill for low-income Chinese and Filipino elders living in Seattle’s CID. Its mission: to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate health services to improve the health of Asian Pacific Islanders and the broader community. Today, ICHS is a Federally Qualified Health Center, is recognized as a premier health care organization, and is the largest provider of health care to Asian Pacific Islanders in Washington state. Our mission has not changed, and our reach has grown from a storefront clinic in the CID to 11 clinics and sites throughout the Seattle metropolitan area, serving nearly 28,000 patients in 70 languages.\n\nThe family medicine residency is located at our founding clinic in the CID, one of Seattle’s oldest, most diverse, and most vibrant neighborhoods. At our clinics, you will see a diverse panel of patients: 85% are persons of color, 84% are low income, 65% are on Medicare and/or Medicaid, 60% have limited English and need interpretation services, and 3% are homeless. Your patients will be your greatest teachers. The high-volume obstetrics at ICHS provides you the opportunity to care for continuity OB patients and their newborns. And your care for these families will often expand to include other family members, spanning multiple generations. As part of your OB training, you will be trained using our in-house ultrasound.\n\nYou will also see a great deal of medical complexity in our adult and geriatric patients. Twenty percent of our patients are over the age of 65. Patients at ICHS Legacy House, an assisted living facility located next door, have primary care providers at our clinic. You will have several opportunities to learn and practice outpatient procedures including joint injections, skin biopsy and excisions, LARCs placement and removal, circumcision, I&D, toenail removals, using ultrasound to screen for abdominal aortic aneurysms, among many others. You will do all your inpatient training through Swedish and Seattle Children’s Hospital and be exposed to many outpatient specialties during your time here. Additionally, we have some in-house specialists at ICHS including infectious disease, podiatry, neurology, and pulmonology.\n\nAt ICHS, you and your patients will be part of a multidisciplinary team that may include interpretation, pharmacy, dentistry, nutrition, psychology, social work, vision, health education, community advocacy, acupuncture, and Chinese traditional medicine. In addition, you will collaborate with other learners in our organization, including ARNP residents, pharmacy students, dental residents, psychology and social work interns, and medical students. At ICHS, collaboration and teamwork are essential elements of providing quality care for our patients.\n\nI look forward to talking more with you. Feel free to reach out to me.\n\nYours truly,",

Otherwise my dental only covers $2000 a year of a $10,000 procedure that would need to happen within the next few months to save my teeth.\n\nI know Washington has medical insurance help, but are there any dental programs? This would be for a periodontist.\n\nUpdate: Thank you everybody. I've contacted UW and tried PIMA, but they were closed. I also was approved for Care Credit and have been looking into each of your recommendations for periodontists and dentists. Unfortunately I don't have the ability to travel internationally to have things done, though - I appreciate everybody's suggestions and insights about it though.\n\nYou've all been very helpful, thank you. <3\n\nUpdate: Surgery is next week! <3 <3 <3 <3 <3\n\n## Comment ID l9nm1re with +411 score by [(judithishere, Reddit, 2024-06-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1dlan15/about_to_lose_my_teeth_and_i_cant_afford_the/l9nm1re/) (in reply to ID 1dlan15):\nUW Dental School.  You will probably have to leave a message when you call, but they will call you back.  I had extensive dental work done there, 10's of thousands dollars worth, for a fraction of the cost.  Would recommend.  Only caveat is your appointments take a bit of time as the student will need to show an instructor the work during your appt so you have to schedule a block of time for each appt (think 2-3 hours)\n\n### Comment ID l9ojbys with +98 score by [(Fantastic_Elk7086, Reddit, 2024-06-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1dlan15/about_to_lose_my_teeth_and_i_cant_afford_the/l9ojbys/) (in reply to ID l9nm1re):\nThe students are awesome too, the guy I work with right now is by far the most gentle with my teeth out of any professional I’ve ever had work on my teeth.

He is new to Seattle and doesn't have a job nor health insurance. He has been experiencing severe stomach pain on and off for the last few months. The pain is severe enough to incapacitate him for an hour or two, until it subsidies. I believe he has an ulcer. I had one when I was younger and, if I remember correctly, his symptoms are very similar to what I had.  He doesn't feel like he can afford to go to a doctor for exam, tests, and medicine.  I can't bear to see my friend in such pain every few days or week. I want to help him with the costs of seeing a doctor.\n\nI'm not wealthy so, I would like to find some place that isn't going to end up costing me a fortune. Does anyone have any suggestions for an affordable place  where I can take my friend to get a medical examination and possibly, tests to diagnose what is causing this gastric pain?

      "# Post ID 1co3jw9: This Week in Destiny 05/09/2024 with +337 score by [(DTG_Bot, Reddit, 2024-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1co3jw9/this_week_in_destiny_05092024/)\nSource: https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/twid-05-09-2024\n\n---\n\nThis week in Destiny, we are talking a bit more about Exotic class items. We announced them along with the Prismatic subclass, and it's time we tell you more about this groundbreaking addition to Destiny 2—and that's just our first topic for the week! \n\n\n\n* More info about the new Exotic class items. \n* New boss profile for The Pantheon. \n* The red border weapons bonanza is here! \n* Zero Hour arrives next week. \n* Check out our new PvP maps trailer. \n* Enjoy Destiny 2: Expansion Open Access now through June 3! \n* The Gauntlet returns for its 10th anniversary \n* It's AANHPI Heritage Month. \n##A Matter of Exotic Class Items\n\n\nThis morning, we shared some amazing videos showcasing the Prismatic subclass coming with The Final Shape. Check them!\n\n\n####Warlock\n* [Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/embed/WY3GNEddJ-U)\n\n####Hunter\n* [Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/embed/G_zUYhy6UnE)\n\n####Titan\n* [Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/embed/h00Drr7UZ8o)\n\n\nAs you can see, you will not only have the new Aspects and Fragments coming with Prismatic, but also will get to further expand your options with the new Exotic class items. These are very special additions to Destiny 2 as each Exotic class item will have two random Exotic perks from a selection of existing Exotic armor perks, including some that belong to classes other than yours! \n\n\n###How to Earn Them \n\n\nThe Exotic Class items will be part of a new activity that unlocks after the Raid World First, at the beginning of Week 2.  We don’t want to spoil what the activity is all about or how to unlock it, but we can say it's farmable, and you will get a guaranteed random roll each time you complete it. \n\n\n###How Many Exotic Perks \n\n\nSimilar to how Prismatic has a selection of abilities among all Light and Darkness classes, the Exotic class items in The Final Shape will have a mix of Exotic armor perks available for each class. We included some fan favorites as well as some perks that aligned with the Prismatic abilities and Aspects. We also chose to put perks in each column that would compound with each other, allowing for combinations that felt powerful and complementary, such as a Warlock bond with Sprit of Apotheosis and Spirt of the Star-Eater. \n\n\n\nPrismatic is all about combining effects that used to belong to specific subclasses, and we wanted to bring that to the design of the Exotic class items, too. So, in many cases, we have adjusted the perks to work with a broader array of abilities. For example, Spirit of Caliban on the Hunter cloak works with all powered melees, not just Proximity Knife. \n\n\n\nTo keep things balanced, we have narrowed some of the perk effects to what we believe the spirit of (get it?) the original Exotic was. This allows the combination of two of them to not be overwhelming, and it maintains a reason to run the original Exotic armor. When a perk on the class item has the same effect as its original version you should expect some tuning changes. For example, in The Final Shape the original Armamentarium and Sixth Coyote will gain the ability to create Orbs of Light from your grenade and dodge respectively. \n\n\n   \n\nCheck out all the possible combos below! \n   \n\n\n###Hunter Exotic Cloak - Essentialism\n\nFirst Column|Second Column  \n|-|-|  \n|**SPIRIT OF THE ASSASSIN:** Finishers and powered melee final blows grant invisibility.|**SPIRIT OF THE STAR-EATER:** While your Super energy is full, picking up an Orb of Power overcharges your Super, granting it bonus damage.|\n|**SPIRIT OF THE INMOST LIGHT:** Using an ability empowers the other two abilities granting them improved energy regeneration. |**SPIRIT OF THE SYNTHOCEPS:** Improved melee damage when you're surrounded. |\n|**SPIRIT OF THE OPHIDIAN:** Weapons ready very quickly. |**SPIRIT OF VERITY:** Weapon final blows with a damage type matching your grenade grant a stacking grenade damage bonus. |\n|**SPIRIT OF THE DRAGON:** Using your class ability reloads all weapons and increases weapon handling speeds for a brief time. |**SPIRIT OF THE CYRTARACHNE:** Gain Woven Mail when you use your grenade. |\n|**SPIRIT OF GALANOR:** Hits and final blows with your Super will return Super energy after it ends. |**SPIRIT OF THE GYRFALCON:** Your Void weapons gain Volatile Rounds after you emerge from being invisible. |\n|**SPIRIT OF THE FOETRACER:** Damaging a powerful combatant or Guardian with an ability grants you a temporary damage bonus for weapons matching that ability's element. |**SPIRIT OF THE LIAR:** Dealing damage with a powered melee or being hit by a melee attack will allow you to follow up with an extremely powerful melee counterpunch. |\n|**SPIRIT OF CALIBAN:** Powered melee final blows trigger an ignition. |**SPIRIT OF THE WORMHUSK:** Dodging gives a small health and shield bump. |\n|**SPIRIT OF RENEWAL:** Allies inside the Duskfield take reduced damage, and targets inside the area deal reduced damage. |**SPIRIT OF THE COYOTE:** Gain an additional class ability charge. |\n\n   \n\n### Titan Exotic Mark - Stoicism\n\n|**First column**|**Second column**|\n|--|--|\n**SPIRIT OF THE ASSASSIN:** Finishers and powered melee final blows grant invisibility. |**SPIRIT OF THE STAR-EATER:** While your Super energy is full, picking up an Orb of Power overcharges your Super, granting it bonus damage. |\n**SPIRIT OF INMOST LIGHT:** Using an ability empowers the other two abilities, granting them improved energy regeneration |**SPIRIT OF SYNTHOCEPS:** Improved melee damage when you're surrounded. |\n**SPIRIT OF THE OPHIDIAN:** Weapons ready very quickly. |**SPIRIT OF VERITY:** Weapon final blows with a damage type matching your grenade grant a stacking grenade damage bonus. |\n**SPIRIT OF SEVERANCE:** Powered melee or finisher final blows unleash a damaging explosion. |**SPIRIT OF CONTACT:** Damaging a target with a powered melee causes all nearby enemies to suffer lightning strikes and become jolted. |\n**SPIRIT OF HOARFROST:** Your Barricade becomes a wall of Stasis crystals that slows nearby targets when created. |**SPIRIT OF SCARS:** Final blows with weapons that have a damage type matching your Super's element create a burst of healing around you that grants allies restoration. |\n**SPIRIT OF THE ETERNAL WARRIOR:** Gain a damage bonus for weapons matching your Super's element when your Super ends. |**SPIRIT OF THE HORN:** Your Barricade unleashes a blast of Solar energy that scorches targets |\n**SPIRIT OF THE ABEYANT:** Improves Drengr’s Lash. Drengr’s Lash projectiles track targets more aggressively and travel further. |**SPIRIT OF ALPHA LUPI:** Generates a healing pulse when Barricade is activated. |\n**SPIRIT OF THE BEAR:** Move faster while guarding with the Unbreakable shield. Damage blocked with Unbreakable is converted to Super energy. |**SPIRIT OF THE ARMAMENTARIUM:** Gain an additional grenade charge. |\n\n   \n\n###Warlock Exotic Band - Solipsism \n\n|**First column**|**Second column**|\n|--|--|\n|**SPIRIT OF THE ASSASSIN:** Finishers and powered melee final blows grant invisibility. |**SPIRIT OF THE STAR-EATER:** While your Super energy is full, picking up an Orb of Power overcharges your Super, granting it bonus damage. |\n**SPIRIT OF INMOST LIGHT:** Using an ability empowers the other two abilities, granting them improved energy regeneration |**SPIRIT OF SYNTHOCEPS:** Improved melee damage when you're surrounded. |\n**SPIRIT OF THE OPHIDIAN:** Weapons ready very quickly. |**SPIRIT OF VERITY:** Weapon final blows with a damage type matching your grenade grant a stacking grenade damage bonus. |\n**SPIRIT OF THE STAG:** Your Rift provides damage reduction to allied Guardians standing in it. |**SPIRIT OF VESPER:** Rifts periodically release Arc shockwaves. |\n**SPIRIT OF THE FILAMENTS:** Casting an empowering rift will grant you Devour. |**SPIRIT OF HARMONY:** Final blows with weapons that have a damage type matching your Super's element grant you Super energy. |\n**SPIRIT OF THE NECROTIC:** Damaging combatants with your melee poisons them.

However, we are also making a set of Exotic armor balance adjustments with the launch of The Final Shape, including some buffs that will impact both the original armor and its Spirit version. So, some of the class item perk combinations might end up being better than you expect. We’ll have more to share about Exotic armor balance in general in the coming weeks.\n\n\n\nWe hope the amazing combinations that the new Exotic class items will allow when using Prismatic have ignited your imagination and you are already wondering what builds will work best when The Final Shape arrives. Let us know, and please share your early build ideas with us.\n\n\n##Another God to Best in The Pantheon \n\n\nGuardians, you have shown the world again that, no matter who you face—be it one god or several—you will always prevail.

Oryx then began a crusade of conquest and death across the universe in pursuit of the Final Shape. \n* After invading Sol to seek vengeance for the death of his son, Crota, and winning a decisive victory at the battle of Saturn, Oryx was dethroned by a valiant fireteam who infiltrated the Dreadnaught and ended the Taken King. \n* Many Hive still tithe to Oryx in secret, though it is not known where the power of their tithes goes, given that the Taken King is dead. \n* After his defeat, Oryx’s corpse fell to Titan where the Lucent Hive attempted to resurrect him through the heretical use of necromancy, a crime for which Oryx once banished another of his sons, Nokris. This scheme was foiled by Guardian operatives. \n\n**OF NOTE** \n\n\n\n* Oryx slew Akka, the Worm of Secrets, and carved the Dreadnaught from its corpse. Hidden operatives report faint biosignatures still pulsing from within the ship’s hull. \n* Through the use of Willbreaker and the Dreadnaught, Oryx may weaponize his throne world, allowing it to spill into the material plane as a wave of destructive power. This weapon claimed the Awoken Fleet during the Battle of Saturn. \n* While imprisoned in the Dreaming City, Savathûn once claimed that her brother Oryx was unable to control his curiosity, that his worm intentionally directs it, and that the worm manipulates Oryx’s actions unbeknownst to him. She claims all Hive worms function in this way. The veracity of this claim is unconfirmed. \n* Eris Morn used Oryx’s Ravenous Heart to construct the Exotic weapon Touch of Malice. \n\n***\n\n\n##All the Deepsight Weapons You Can Get! \n\n\n[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blteee2e3972fc22e34/663c74ba1357525e2229d499/FrontPageBanner_PC_1920x590_TWIDRedBorder_050924.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/3ZQ1v7r.jpeg)\n\nWelcome, everyone, to the red border weapons bonanza! In a similar fashion to what we did last year, players who have not earned enough Deepsight weapons to unlock the Patterns of Year-6 Seasonal weapons now have the chance to catch up before The Final Shape launches. \n\n\n\nEvery day, from May 7 through June 3, players will get a guaranteed Deepsight weapon drop upon completion of a Seasonal activity. So, if you still have not unlocked the Pattern for, let's say, the Raconteur Bow from Season of Defiance, you can complete a Defiant Battleground to receive a Deepsight drop of that very weapon. You will get another the day after and another the day after that one, and so on until you have completed the Pattern. Don't worry much if you have more than one. If you keep playing, our knockout system will ensure you'll only get drops for those weapons. \n\n\n\nSo, what activities can you play from each Season to get these awesome rewards? \n\n\n\n* Season of Defiance \n\n\n\n   * Defiant Battlegrounds \n\n\n   * Mission AVALON \n\n\n* Season of the Deep \n\n\n\n   * Deep Dives \n\n\n   * Salvage \n\n\n* Season of the Witch \n\n\n\n   * Summoning Pools \n\n\n   * Savathûn's Spire \n\n\n* Season of the Wish \n\n\n\n   * Riven's Lair \n\n\n   * The Coil \n\n\n\nWe hope you have a great time revisiting some of the amazing activities that have defined this year of Destiny 2, all while you complete your weapons collection. \n\n\n##Zero Hour Is Near \n\n\n[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blt65e64c7a9b1f9c3e/663c76a4e5f2142a32ee2205/2024_Into_the_Light_Press_Kit_Zero_Hour_COMPRESSED_000.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/KhInoSH.jpeg)\n\nFirst came The Whisper, then it was Zero Hour. The second-ever Destiny 2 secret Exotic mission is coming back on May 14. You'll be able to find it in the Into the Light node in the Director, and it has a few surprises up its sleeve. \n\n\n\nThose capable enough to complete it before their time runs out (40 minutes on Normal and 20 minutes on Legend), will get the new craftable version of the Outbreak Perfected Exotic Pulse Rifle. Find some of the secret chests available each week to also unlock new additional perks for it. If you are looking for its Exotic catalyst, you'll have to complete Zero Hour on Legend difficulty, but remember that if you got the catalyst for the original version, you won't have to earn it again. That said, you will still want to do it to get the weekly Triumphs required to unlock the new Exotic ship. \n\n\n###And TR3-VR Is Near, Too... \n\n\nRemember TR3-VR, the overly attached&nbsp;robot that kept the Cryptarchy's vaults safe in Zero Hour? It was impossible to miss! So much joy, so many wonderful memories... Well, great news, everyone! He'll be back, too. \n\n\n\nTo celebrate his timely return, we would love it if you all shared your best moments with him: well-scripted videos, funny screenshots, fanart, comics, musical numbers... it's all on the table. And if this is your first time meeting him,  we can't wait to see your experiences. \n\n\n\nJust don't forget to use the **#MyFriendTR3VR** hashtag when sharing it on social media so we can see your creations and maybe pick a few to share in the future. Our favorite submissions could get the AOTW or MOTW emblems (don't forget to include your BungieID with your creation). \n\n\n##Three New PvP Maps in One Trailer \n\n\n[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blt13b378ceb7ecb595/66290d4fe7ce956b3cdea704/Crucible_FrontPageBanner_1920x590_1.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/AEfog54.jpeg)\n\nShaxx has been busy lately. Not only is he leading Guardians as they repel the Witness’s forces in Onslaught, he also has secured three new maps for Crucible so everyone can test their 3v3 combat capabilities in new environments. Just remember to sign your waivers. \n\n\n\nThe new maps are called Eventide Labs, Cirrus Plaza, and Dissonance, and they are set on Europa, Neptune, and a terraformed Pyramid ship. We have a new trailer so you can check them out in all their glory! \n\n[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/embed/RZ90EswYLxw)\n\nDon't worry about map rotations either. These maps have their own playlist, so you can play them non-stop until you know them better than yourself. Everyone who participates in the playlist before The Final Shape goes live gets [an incredible Crucible-themed emblem!](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/twid-05-02-2024) \n\n\n##A Great Time to Jump Into Destiny 2\n\n\nIn anticipation of our battle with the Witness, we want everyone to be ready. And we really mean it. Starting May 7 and running through June 3, we have launched Destiny 2: Expansion Open Access period. \n\n[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/embed/yb80CvCeBjE)\n\nDuring those 28 days, the following contents will be **available to all players**: \n\n\n\n**Expansions** \n\n\n\n* Destiny 2: Shadowkeep \n* Destiny 2: Beyond Light \n* Destiny 2: The Witch Queen \n\n**Year-6 Seasons** \n\n\n\n* Destiny 2: Season of Defiance \n* Destiny 2: Season of the Deep \n* Destiny 2: Season of the Witch \n* Destiny 2: Season of the Wish \n\nPlayStation Plus members can also claim the Destiny 2: Lightfall, which will be available up until June 3. No matter what Expansion you play, all the rewards you earn during this period are yours to keep forever, no matter if they are Exotics, raid weapons, or high-stat Legendary armor.\n\n\n\nAnd that's not all! When The Final Shape launches on June 4, the campaigns for Shadowkeep and Beyond Light along with the Stasis subclass will remain available to all players at no additional cost. \n\n\n\nIf you are looking to get everything else that the Shadowkeep and Beyond Light expansions have to offer beyond the campaigns, we will have two packs at your disposal, similar to the Forsaken Pack. \n\n\n\nThe Shadowkeep Pack grants access to: \n\n\n\n* 13 Exotic weapons \n* 3 Exotic armor pieces \n* The Scarlet Keep Nightfall \n* The Pit of Heresy dungeon \n* The Garden of Salvation raid \n\nThe Beyond Light Pack grants access to: \n\n\n\n* 12 Exotic weapons \n* 6 Exotic armor pieces \n* The Glassway and Proving Grounds Nightfalls \n* The Deep Stone Crypt raid \n\nOnce The Final Shape is live, we'll also launch a new pack called the Destiny 2: Legacy Collection 2024. This pack will give you access to some of the best content Destiny has to offer: \n\n\n\n* Destiny 2: Lightfall \n* Destiny 2: The Witch Queen  \n* Destiny 2: Bungie 30th Anniversary Pack \n* Destiny 2: Beyond Light Pack \n* Destiny 2: Shadowkeep Pack \n* Destiny 2: Forsaken Pack \n\n##The Gauntlet Returns for Its Tenth Anniversary \n\n\nOn May 19, Team Bungie will compete in [The Gauntlet](https://bung.ie/gauntlet), a charity tournament of tabletop games amongst game industry professionals, all in support of our longtime partner [Gamer’s Engaged](https://www.gamersengaged.org/). \n\n\n\nHow can you help us Shine Triumphant and take home the trophy again?

Your donations will fund free and low-cost health services for uninsured or underinsured ICHS patients who would otherwise be unable to afford them. \n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blt6261442718854d05/663c791c8447cb7dc99cc386/d1_210_emblem_social.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/UIbQJ7c.jpeg)\n\n[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blteaf70d466dc3f5b8/663c791d5f2485743bd0de15/Stand_With_Asians_1920x1080.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/FLqipKS.jpeg)\n###More about Asians@Bungie \n\n\nAsians@Bungie was founded at the end of 2021 in response to rising discrimination and violence against AANHPI communities. Their mission is to uplift their fellow AANHPI employees, to provide Bungie diverse insight int AANHPI cultures, and to support local AANHPI communities. \n\n\n###More about ICHS: \n\n\nICHS was formed in 1973 by young Asian American activists with the goal of disrupting systemic racism that denied healthcare to Asian immigrant communities. Today, ICHS remains deeply rooted in the Asian Pacific Islander community and continues to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate health services in more than 70 languages. This has significantly improved the wellness of King County’s diverse people and communities, regardless of patients’ ability to pay. \n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/bltef9c3ce997a3769a/663c79602a72d92387179a06/ICHS-Bungie-Blog-Photo-2023.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/I4YrNMK.jpeg)\n\nWe invite all allies to support the AANHPI communities by purchasing the Stand With Asians pin, which also comes with the Harmonic Waves emblem. You can purchase the pin at both the [Bungie Store](https://bungiestore.com/stand-with-asians-collectible-pin) and the [EU Bungie Store](https://eu.bungiestore.com/stand-with-asians-collectible-pin). \n\n\n\nThe Harmonic Waves emblem will also be available with a [$10 donation through the Bungie Foundation](https://bung.ie/aanhpi2024). All donations received in May will support ICHS. \n\n\n##Player Support Report \n\n\n*Solar Warlock Money Gang.

Players will be directed to speak to Shaxx during the last week of Into the Light. \n\n\n###Risky Archery Emote \n\n\nDue to an issue, the Risky Archery emote has been temporarily changed to use a different animation. Once the issue is fixed in a future update, the Risky Archery emote will return to its normal animation. \n\n\n###Player Privacy and Safety Update \n\n\nAs mentioned in our recent March 14 TWID, we are continuing with our efforts to ensure player privacy and safety online in Destiny 2. Our goal is to provide age-appropriate experiences to all our players and give the adults responsible for our younger players a way to tailor those players' experiences. If you haven’t already, please visit Bungie.net or use the prompt after launching Destiny 2 to update your date of birth. \n\n\n####Parental Controls \n\n\nIn May, parents, guardians, and other responsible adults will be able to adjust their child’s Destiny 2 settings.\n\n\n\nTo set up parental controls, both the child and their adult will need a Bungie.net account, and we will need to verify that the person providing consent and setting controls is an adult. We have created a [Parental Controls Help article](https://help.bungie.net/articles/24217906958868) with details explaining how to create an account and link it up to their child's.\n\n\n\nWe are also updating our [privacy policy](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Legal/privacypolicy) on May 14.

It's currently cheaper to buy Lightfall + Annual Pass on a third party site like CD keys, or even on official sites when on sale, than to purchase the Lightfall dungeon key.\n\nMy friends are enjoying the F2P content of Into The Light but it's really hard to sell someone on - \n\n* $60 Legacy Collection 2024 \n* $100 Final Shape + Annual Pass (It's not really worth purchasing TFS without the pass in my opinion.)\n* $40 Dungeon Keys for Witch Queen and Lightfall\n\nI'm sure that there will be a sale eventually that'll make this all a lot more palatable to purchase but, I just wish it was simple and easy out the gate.

Can't be both.\n\n#### Comment ID l3bmi6s with +1 score by [(alittlelilypad, Reddit, 2024-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1co3jw9/this_week_in_destiny_05092024/l3bmi6s/) (in reply to ID l3bhyih):\nAh. Thanks. Yeah, sorry. My wording was a bit bad. I knew you couldn't use two at once, but I was wondering if we could use regular exotics.\n\n## Comment ID l3bhqre with +1 score by [(Ahhh___Pain, Reddit, 2024-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1co3jw9/this_week_in_destiny_05092024/l3bhqre/) (in reply to ID 1co3jw9):\nWith spirit of galanor being for prismatic hunters, hopefully theyre reworking skull of dire ahamkara to be useful/ similar to that perk\n\n## Comment ID l3bkbs1 with +1 score by [(Mnkke, Reddit, 2024-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1co3jw9/this_week_in_destiny_05092024/l3bkbs1/) (in reply to ID 1co3jw9):\nQuestion: How does Warlock not become the uncontested best DPS role now? Isn't Apotheosis Needlestorm already one of the highest DPS rotations possible?\n\nGiven, we don't know numbers at all. But even just a 35% from Star Eaters (half of its effect) pushes Needlestorm to 540k (stronger than Knock Em Down + Full SES Blades by ~10k IIRC).\n\nMaybe this is just undue panic, but hopefully it's just the buff lets thing be competitive in the DPS scene, and not establish a new hard META.\n\nThe class items for sure came out more balanced than I thought though. Meaning, 8 from your class, 4 from another. I was expecting like, fully random among each class, this makes me more excited for them.\n\n### Comment ID l3btxkm with +1 score by [(krilltucky, Reddit, 2024-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1co3jw9/this_week_in_destiny_05092024/l3btxkm/) (in reply to ID l3bkbs1):\nit at least gives warlocks an excuse not to have to well. dont need it if the boss dies too fast to multiple SES galanor goldies and SES needlestorms\n\n#### Comment ID l3bw6e9 with +2 score by [(Mnkke, Reddit, 2024-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1co3jw9/this_week_in_destiny_05092024/l3bw6e9/) (in reply to ID l3btxkm):\nFor sure, which is great.\n\nI just hope it doesn't create a new heavily ingrained meta.\n\n## Comment ID l3bnfuy with +1 score by [(Venaixis94, Reddit, 2024-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1co3jw9/this_week_in_destiny_05092024/l3bnfuy/) (in reply to ID 1co3jw9):\nHopefully stasis becoming free will mean it will finally get some additional super/grenades/melees\n\n## Comment ID l3bnhao with +1 score by [(Lt_CowboyDan, Reddit, 2024-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1co3jw9/this_week_in_destiny_05092024/l3bnhao/) (in reply to ID 1co3jw9):\nSpirit of Galanor AND star eater 😳\n\n## Comment ID l3bs5p5 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1co3jw9/this_week_in_destiny_05092024/l3bs5p5/) (in reply to ID 1co3jw9):\nArmamentarium's entire shtick became a single perk and the only thing it's getting to differentiate it is making orbs. We titans are absolutely fucked when it comes to getting interesting exotics or reworks.\n\n## Comment ID l3bzhiv with +1 score by [(tankercat67, Reddit, 2024-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1co3jw9/this_week_in_destiny_05092024/l3bzhiv/) (in reply to ID 1co3jw9):\nHow is nobody talking about Spirt of Necrotic? It’s the entire original effect, letting you run almost all of one of Warlocks strongest builds (Arcane Needle+Necrotic Poison+Osteo) with the only downside being not suspending. Which honestly was always the least important part for me.\n\nAlso consider with Facet of Grace, kinetic weapon damage gives extra Transcendence energy. Guess what the poison from Osteo counts as? You can have all that while still running whatever you want for your grenade, super, aspects, and other half of the exotic.\n\n\n\n## Comment ID l3c4lju with +1 score by [(LegendXCarisso, Reddit, 2024-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1co3jw9/this_week_in_destiny_05092024/l3c4lju/) (in reply to ID 1co3jw9):\nI might be in the minority, but I saw Warlocks get *Apotheosis* and I'm like..... *\"But Bungie, we could have had Sunbracers. We could have had Karnsteins... and you went with the* ***exotic that literally looks like a man after he's stepped in an Alaskan lake for a bit of a January swim****???\"* \n\nSuffice it to say, I'm sorta let down and feel Warlocks are getting the shaft once again. Neutral game for Warlocks is great, but every time we get something good, it gets destroyed almost immediately. Meanwhile, Bubble Titan is STILL running rampant. Help me out here fellow Warlocks... what combinations are you guys seeing? Outside of maybe Necro / Claw, I ain't seeing much."

As within many large healthcare centers - there's a smorgasbord of different care providers with different egos, styles, and biases. If interpreters call out sick or the video interpreter machine doesn't work, your work gets a lot harder. Seems to try to stretch everyone. Supervisors are also overloaded, lots of geriatric patients here from the nursing home that is located near the clinic. Lot of complicated patients with cultural and language barriers here. \r\n\r\nBased on reviewing medical records of patients, the provider that I replaced was here for about 1 year before he left. I saw about 2-3 other names of people who used to work there. However, there are some people who have been around for a LONG time. As with many work environments, there's some politics as play, lots of ego.\r\n\r\nIt was hard because as I was getting credentialed, I had to have someone else sign off on my charts who was credentialed. The feedback was helpful at times, but it was just too much. Some of the providers disagreed with each other on the feedback. It just my life that much harder on top of everything else. \r\n\r\nI think a coworker I used to know has also left that place within the last few months. Midlevels seem to have an uphill battle here. They typically need locums for coverage. You have to get credentialed for everything and getting credentialed takes forever.",

Or they have been re-orged out of the organization because of the many changes in the management structure.  I have never seen a management team turnover this high in any organization I have worked in.  Original ideas are not accepted and there is no possibility of meaningful discussions or raising legitimate concerns.  Top management cuts people off in mid-sentence and is very disrespectful so therefore, there is a general feeling of dislike and disrespect throughout the organization.

Stop sending out stupid annual promises of a pay increase and it is only a few cents! What a slap in the face. You guys can have that since it looks like you're hurting so much you can't even pay your employees a livable wage! Despicable! PAY US MORE!!!!!

      "# [ICHS will open a new Aging in PACE senior care facility in Beacon Hill by International Community Health Services on 2023-11-04](https://iexaminer.org/ichs-will-open-a-new-aging-in-pace-senior-care-facility-in-beacon-hill/)\nInternational Community Health Services (ICHS) has signed a purchase and sale agreement with Seattle Chinatown International District Preservation and Development Authority (SCIDpda) to acquire a 25,000 square-foot space in SCIDpda’s Beacon Pacific Village, formerly known as the “North Lot project” at the foot of the Pacific Medical Center in Seattle’s Beacon Hill neighborhood.\n\nLocated at 1200 12th Avenue South, ICHS will construct a new senior care facility named “AiPACE” to expand its current PACE program and significantly increase its capacity to serve seniors in King County. PACE (Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly) is a nationally-recognized model of care that enables low-income, nursing-home eligible adults to live independently at home or in the community.\n\nIn 2015, ICHS launched the Aging in PACE Washington (AiPACE) capital campaign to build and operate a new site for its PACE program. “The AiPACE campaign has been at the forefront of ICHS’ efforts to address community needs,” said Kelli Nomura, ICHS CEO.\n\n“The PACE model is deeply meaningful to me,” Nomura said. “The program provides all of the care, support, and critical activities that our elders in our community need, while allowing them to remain in their home and community. It will give families across our community peace of mind knowing every day that their loved one is supported by an integrated team that truly cares.”\n\nThe state-of-the-art senior center and clinic will provide vital wraparound services to seniors living throughout King County. A revolutionary aging-in-place model of care, PACE is designed to empower seniors to stay active, stay connected, and stay rooted in their own homes and communities.\n\nAbove the new AiPACE facility will be 160 units of affordable, family-sized housing (20% of which will be 3- or 4-bedroom units) developed and managed by SCIDpda. Jose Marti Child Development Center, operated by El Centro de la Raza, will also occupy a neighboring commercial space in the building.\n\n“What happens on the ground floor of these projects is just as important as the affordable housing we build above,” said Jamie Lee, Co-Executive Director of SCIDpda. “ICHS’ services will enhance the experiences of residents at the Beacon Pacific Village and provide much-needed care to the communities we serve in the area. We’re excited to welcome AiPACE to Beacon Pacific Village.”\n\n“This is a gigantic step forward for us all to reach our goal of building a PACE site that serves our culturally and linguistically diverse communities,” said Paul Mar, AiPACE Capital Campaign Committee Co-Chair.\n\nLanguage and cultural barriers pose further challenges for limited-English-speaking immigrant families to receive personalized medical care. For many, transportation to and from appointments pose further barriers to senior care services.\n\n“That’s why providing integrated health care is so important,” Nomura said. More than doctor visits, participants will have individualized care plans which include skilled-nursing, door-to-door transportation, therapy, exercise classes, social interaction, healthy meals, and much more.\n\n“I’m thrilled to take this big step in making AiPACE closer to becoming a reality,” said Leeching Tran, AiPACE Capital Campaign Committee Co-Chair. “Having a place where our elders can safely and easily gather and have their needs met while still living at home with their families is a benefit to all generations of our community.”\n\nThe next step for ICHS\n\nConstruction of the Beacon Pacific Village is planned to finish by the end of Summer 2024. Then ICHS would begin tenant improvement and open the AiPACE facility in late 2025.\n\n“The dream of providing a safe, caring place for our AANHPI elders to have the support they want and need just got closer to becoming a reality,” said Martha Choe, AiPACE capital campaign committee co-chair. “I wish my parents had benefited from AiPACE, where their medical, dental, and behavioral health needs would have been provided for while living at home. When this is up and running, so many families will celebrate!”\n\nICHS is a non-profit federally qualified community health center that provides culturally- and linguistically-appropriate health and wellness services to people of all ages.\n\nSCIDpda is a community development organization whose mission is to preserve, promote, and develop the Seattle Chinatown International District as a vibrant community and unique ethnic neighborhood.\n\nICHS and SCIDpda have partnered for decades. In 1998 SCIDpda developed the ID Village Square where ICHS’ International District Medical & Dental Clinic is located. In March 2019, SCIDpda transitioned management of Legacy House to ICHS.",

Each year, ICHS provides direct patient care, health support services, and preventive education to over 21,400 individuals. In 2012, ICHS was recognized by the National Committee for Quality Assurance as a “patient-centered medical home” for its work in providing team-led, coordinated health care. For over 40 years, ICHS has provided culturally-appropriate and multilingual care to improve the health of our community. ICHS began in 1973 as a small storefront clinic in Seattle's International District. Today it is the largest Asian, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander community health center in Washington state.",

      "# [ICHS ranked Washington State’s No. 1 community health center by efelle creative](https://www.ichs.com/news/ichs-ranked-washington-states-no-1-community-health-center)\nInternational Community Health Services (ICHS) was ranked the top performing federally-qualified community health center in all of Washington state in Medicaid Cost and Quality by the Washington Health Alliance. The ranking in the Where You Live Matters: Community Checkup 2024 report is based upon quality and cost measures compared across the state’s best performing health care providers.\n\n“Earning recognition in the Washington Health Alliance report isn't just an honor,” said Dr. Deepa Lakshimi Yerram, ICHS Chief Medical Officer. “It's a validation of our dedication to serving our community with the highest standards of care. Think of the Washington Health Alliance as a scorecard for healthcare in Washington. Their Common Measure Set, based on real data, identifies providers who excel in delivering quality care at a responsible cost. We're proud to be recognized among the top performers, demonstrating our commitment to providing accessible, efficient healthcare for everyone.”\n\nThe Community Checkup is an annual report highlighting health care quality and value at medical groups and hospitals in Washington state. The data gives providers and patients a big picture look at healthcare throughout the state in an overall effort to transform the health care system for the better. Data points were charted from 36 data sources that illustrate the lived experiences of more than 4 million people across Washington state receiving care at 1,875 clinics, 325 medical groups, 100 hospitals and 16 health plans. Washingtonians with Medicaid and private insurance, living in both urban and rural areas were all included.\n\nWashington state is home to 27 federally qualified community health centers (FQHC) that deliver health care to more than 1.1 million Washingtonians each year at more than 350 clinic sites. These non-profit health care providers provide high-quality, cost-effective health services to everyone who walks through their doors.\n\nIn 2022, ICHS provided health services to 30,612 patients who spoke more than 70 languages. 47% of ICHS patients were on Medicaid insurance plans — almost double the rate Washington state share of population covered by Medicaid according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\n“ICHS received the lowest in our Medicaid cost utilization,” said Wendy Kim, ICHS Quality and Accreditation Manager. “That meant that we really took care of our patients. They weren't going to hospitals for their care. They weren't overspending on costly, unnecessary medical treatments. [Their health needs] were all taken care of here at ICHS.”\n\n“Addressing Care Gaps”\n\nICHS was compared to other Washington health care organizations in the Where You Live Matters: Community Checkup 2024 report based upon patient care measures. These include rates of well child checkups, the number of patients who take their required medications, and the screenings for health conditions such as breast cancer and diabetes.\n\nICHS as a primary care community health center has long prioritized preventive screenings as part of ICHS’ health and wellness services, said Jin Yi Zhou, ICHS Quality Improvement Administrator. Not getting screenings could result in more severe disease that require costlier treatments, visits to emergency rooms or hospitals.\n\nOne major achievement that stood out in the report is ICHS surpassing the 90th Percentile National benchmark for care providers for patients completing on-time colon cancer screening.\n\nAccording to health researchers, colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the world, and yet screenings remain “underused,” These scores, Zhou said, set “the bar” for excellence in performance nationwide.\n\nICHS’ quality improvement team actively evaluates the quality of preventive care provided within each of the medical clinics at ICHS. The top ranking is largely because of the patient-provider trust that ICHS has built over the last 50 years serving diverse communities. From providers in the clinic, to teams of population health staff that call and speak with patients to walk them through preventative care and screenings.\n\nZhou knows this directly — he and his family were patients at ICHS before he joined as an employee.\n\n“Speaking from my own family’s experience, they would receive calls from someone speaking their language telling them about medical screenings and appointments,” said Zhou. “That is already a huge plus. Someone would [explain] their care to them. Communication is very, very efficient at ICHS and patients, they enjoy the experience.”\n\nHealth research has found that U.S. immigrants have lower health screening rates than native-born Americans. Having regular screening tests — medical tests to check for diseases early and when they may be easier to treat — are essential to living a longer healthier life, according to the CDC. However, immigrants face cultural, language, and financial barriers to receive life-saving screenings.\n\nThat’s why ICHS’ Quality Improvement and Population Health teams are so important, said Kim.\n\nWhen asked how ICHS achieved such high screening numbers, Kim shared that it’s largely due to the efforts of ICHS’ population health team who launch robust health education campaigns that are linguistically and culturally competent for ICHS’ patients.\n\nFrom in-language postcards, text and phone outreach to patients in the languages they speak, and comprehensive data tracking to follow-up on ICHS patients most at risk, said Kim.\n\nAt the end of the day, it’s really a team effort from across the non-profit organization that makes ICHS an integrated care home for patients.\n\n“Congratulations to the QI, Population Health, Clinical, Providers, RNs, MAs, PSRs, Data Team, Eligibility, Care Managers, and Care Coordinators, for their collective efforts in making ICHS the lowest Medicaid cost center in the state of Washington for healthcare,” said Kim. “Together we are improving healthcare accessibility and affordability for all of our patients.”",
      "# [New study examines increasing suicide rates in Asian American youth by Diana Opong, Brooklyn Jamerson-Flowers on 2024-09-09](https://www.kuow.org/stories/new-study-examines-increasing-suicide-rates-in-asi)\nThis week (September 8th to 14th) is National Suicide Prevention Week.\n\nDeaths by suicide in young people have risen by more than 60% in recent decades. And in 2022, it was the second leading cause of death for people aged 10-14.\n\nBehind that tragic statistic is a lot of nuance, though.\n\nFor example: Alaska Natives, American Indians, and White youth are more likely to take their own lives than their Asian American peers. But researchers say even that statistic masks the reality of suicide rates in Asian American young people, and that rates vary greatly by subgroup.\n\nSoundside spoke with Dr. Anthony L. Bui, lead author of a study that looked at suicide rates in Asian American youth. Dr. Bui is also an acting assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington School of Medicine and a researcher at the Seattle Children’s Research Institute.\n\nHe believes that by better understanding the background of individuals at risk, we can develop culturally specific and more effective approaches to youth mental health care.\n\nDr. Bui's study was recently published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Pediatrics.\n\nDuring our conversation Dr. Bui noted the importance of reaching out to professionals like school therapists when you are concerned about the youth in your life.\n\nSoundside called up one of those school-based, child mental health specialists -- Ana Short -- to learn more about what culturally appropriate health care for young people may look like in practice.\n\nCorrection notice, 2:13p.m. on Thursday, 9/12/2024: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Ana Short worked for Internal Community Health Services. This story has been amended to the correct employer: International Community Health Services.\n\nGuests:\n\nDr. Anthony L Bui, acting assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle.\n\nAna Short, child mental health specialist with International Community Health Services.\n\nRelated Links:",

      "# [ICHS and LIHI partner to bring state-of-the-art health facility and affordable housing to Chinatown International District by efelle creative](https://www.ichs.com/news/ichs-and-lihi-partner-to-bring-state-of-the-art-health-facility-and-affordable-housing-to-chinatown-international-district)\nInternational Community Health Services (ICHS) is partnering with Low Income Housing Institute (LIHI) in the construction of a mixed-use development that will be the home of a new state of the art healthcare facility as well as affordable housing in the Chinatown International District.\n\nIn March, ICHS and LIHI worked with a developer to complete the purchase and sale of a building on 7th Ave S. and Lane Street. The building is just one block from ICHS’ current International District clinic location — ICHS’ largest, serving nearly 11,000 patients annually.\n\n“The new site is an important step for ICHS and will be a wonderful new home for our clinic, offering an enhanced work environment and the continued delivery of quality healthcare services,” said ICHS CEO Kelli Nomura. “This will offer us the opportunity to better serve our patients, to continue to work with our valuable business partners in the CID community, and to remain committed to our roots — serving the Chinatown International District and its people at an affordable cost.”\n\nDevelopment of the new property will not begin until approximately 2026. A plan will be developed to determine the design of the building and what services will be offered at the new location that is in alignment with ICHS’ vision of the future in serving the community.\n\nLIHI plans to build 90 affordable units for families and individuals above ICHS’ new healthcare facility. The location of the property in the Chinatown International District offers families with convenient transportation, recreation, shopping and services. The building will include three floors of commercial space with parking below.\n\nThe purchase of the property is the first step in the partnership and years-long design and development process between ICHS and LIHI.\n\n“We look forward to working with the many interests in the Chinatown International District to make the mixed-use development responsive to the needs of the community,” said LIHI executive director Sharon Lee.\n\nFounded in 1991, LIHI is a nonprofit organization that develops, owns, and operates affordable housing in Seattle and the Puget Sound region. LIHI owns over 3,500 housing units at 75 sites and provides 18 tiny house villages.\n\nICHS provides culturally and linguistically appropriate health services in over 70 languages to improve the wellness of King County’s diverse people and communities, regardless of patients’ ability to pay. Since its founding in 1973, ICHS has grown from a single storefront clinic in Seattle’s Chinatown International District with deep roots in the Asian Pacific Islander community, to a regional health care provider employing more than 600 staff and serving over 30,000 patients at 11 service locations.",

    "# Comprehensive Analyst Report on International Community Health Services (ICHS)\n\n## Company Overview\nInternational Community Health Services (ICHS) is a nonprofit community health center based in Seattle, Washington, that provides affordable health care services primarily to Asian, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander communities, as well as other underserved populations. Established in 1973, ICHS has grown from a small storefront clinic in Seattle's International District to the largest health center serving these communities in Washington state, employing over 600 staff and serving more than 30,000 patients annually across 11 service locations [(ICHS, 2023)](https://capaa.wa.gov/asian-pacific-american-directory/international-community-health-services).\n\nICHS is recognized for its culturally and linguistically appropriate health services, offering care in over 70 languages. In 2022, the organization provided health services to 30,612 patients, with 47% of them on Medicaid insurance plans, which is significantly higher than the state average [(Shoreline Area News, 2024)](https://www.shorelineareanews.com/2024/03/international-community-health-services.html).\n\n## Recent Developments\n### New Facility and Expansion\nICHS has recently signed a purchase and sale agreement with the Seattle Chinatown International District Preservation and Development Authority (SCIDpda) to acquire a 25,000 square-foot space in Beacon Hill, Seattle. This site will house a new senior care facility named \"AiPACE,\" aimed at expanding ICHS's current PACE (Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly) program. The facility is expected to enhance the capacity to serve seniors in King County, providing comprehensive care that allows them to live independently at home [(ICHS, 2023)](https://iexaminer.org/ichs-will-open-a-new-aging-in-pace-senior-care-facility-in-beacon-hill/).\n\nKelli Nomura, CEO of ICHS, emphasized the importance of the PACE model, stating, “The program provides all of the care, support, and critical activities that our elders in our community need, while allowing them to remain in their home and community” [(ICHS, 2023)](https://iexaminer.org/ichs-will-open-a-new-aging-in-pace-senior-care-facility-in-beacon-hill/). The construction of the AiPACE facility is planned to be completed by the end of Summer 2024, with the facility expected to open in late 2025 [(ICHS, 2023)](https://iexaminer.org/ichs-will-open-a-new-aging-in-pace-senior-care-facility-in-beacon-hill/).\n\n### Partnerships and Collaborations\nICHS has a long-standing partnership with SCIDpda, which has facilitated the development of various health and community services in the Chinatown International District. In addition to the AiPACE project, ICHS is collaborating with the Low Income Housing Institute (LIHI) to construct a mixed-use development that will include a new healthcare facility and affordable housing [(ICHS, 2023)](https://www.ichs.com/news/ichs-and-lihi-partner-to-bring-state-of-the-art-health-facility-and-affordable-housing-to-chinatown-international-district).\n\n## Performance and Recognition\nICHS has been recognized as the top-performing federally qualified community health center in Washington state in terms of Medicaid cost and quality, according to the Washington Health Alliance's 2024 report. This recognition is based on various quality and cost measures, highlighting ICHS's commitment to providing high-quality, accessible healthcare [(Shoreline Area News, 2024)](https://www.shorelineareanews.com/2024/03/international-community-health-services.html).\n\nDr. Deepa Lakshimi Yerram, ICHS's Chief Medical Officer, remarked, “Earning recognition in the Washington Health Alliance report isn't just an honor; it's a validation of our dedication to serving our community with the highest standards of care” [(Shoreline Area News, 2024)](https://www.shorelineareanews.com/2024/03/international-community-health-services.html).\n\n## Community Impact\nICHS has made significant strides in addressing healthcare disparities among immigrant populations. The organization has implemented robust health education campaigns that are culturally and linguistically competent, which have contributed to high screening rates for preventive care among its patients. For instance, ICHS surpassed the 90th percentile national benchmark for timely colon cancer screenings, a critical achievement given the underutilization of such screenings among immigrant communities [(Shoreline Area News, 2024)](https://www.shorelineareanews.com/2024/03/international-community-health-services.html).\n\nWendy Kim, ICHS's Quality and Accreditation Manager, noted, “ICHS received the lowest in our Medicaid cost utilization... [Their health needs] were all taken care of here at ICHS” [(Shoreline Area News, 2024)](https://www.shorelineareanews.com/2024/03/international-community-health-services.html).\n\n## Conclusion\nInternational Community Health Services is a vital organization in the Seattle area, providing essential health services to diverse and underserved communities. With its recent initiatives to expand facilities and enhance service offerings, ICHS is well-positioned to continue its mission of improving health outcomes for its patients. The recognition it has received for quality and cost-effectiveness further underscores its commitment to excellence in community health care. \n\nProspective candidates and investors should consider ICHS's strong community ties, innovative care models, and proven track record of success as key factors in their engagement with the organization."
