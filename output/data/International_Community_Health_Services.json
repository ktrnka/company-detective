  "summary_markdown": "# About International Community Health Services\n\nInternational Community Health Services (ICHS) is a federally qualified community health center based in Seattle, Washington. Founded over 50 years ago, ICHS has grown from an all-volunteer clinic to a comprehensive healthcare provider. The organization serves over 31,000 patients annually, with a significant focus on the Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) community [(Kelli Nomura, N.A.P Contributor, 2024-12-16)](https://napost.com/2024/news1-12132024/). ICHS is dedicated to providing accessible healthcare to low-income, uninsured, and immigrant populations, emphasizing health equity and ensuring care for all individuals, regardless of language, immigration status, or financial barriers [(Kelli Nomura, N.A.P Contributor, 2024-12-16)](https://napost.com/2024/news1-12132024/).\n\nICHS offers a variety of health services, including primary care, dental care, and behavioral health services. Starting March 8, 2025, behavioral health services will be available on Saturdays at the Bellevue clinic for enrolled patients aged 13 and older [(ICHS website)](https://www.ichs.com/). The organization also provides specialized services for the elderly through its PACE program, which supports elderly immigrants and their caregivers [(Rachel Boyoung Kim, King 5, 2024-12-18)](https://www.king5.com/article/news/community/facing-race/caregiving-immigrant-elders-united-states/281-64420b65-1ebc-4021-9efe-7ae49afba495).\n\nICHS serves a diverse patient population, focusing on community health and accessibility. Patients must be enrolled in primary care or dental services to access certain integrated health services [(ICHS website)](https://www.ichs.com/). The organization collaborates with various partners, such as the Bellevue School District, to enhance its service offerings and ensure students have access to necessary healthcare [(efelle creative, 2024-12-20)](https://www.bsd405.org/about-us/news/news-details/~board/bsd-news/post/students-staff-and-community-partners-share-in-a-season-of-gratitude).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\nICHS is led by CEO Kelli Nomura, who has been recognized as a Diversity Champion by the Puget Sound Business Journal for her commitment to health equity and advocacy for marginalized communities [(Kelli Nomura, N.A.P Contributor, 2024-12-16)](https://napost.com/2024/news1-12132024/).

CEO Kelli Nomura expressed concern over the safety of patients, emphasizing the need for a safe environment for healthcare access [(Sharon Yoo, King 5, 2024-12-09)](https://www.king5.com/article/news/community/facing-race/violent-crime-cid-deterring-patients-seeking-medical-care/281-516aaf68-830b-47d4-a865-bf6490aa89a1). Despite these challenges, ICHS remains committed to its mission, and a slight decrease in violent crime in the CID may help restore patient confidence [(Sharon Yoo, King 5, 2024-12-09)](https://www.king5.com/article/news/community/facing-race/violent-crime-cid-deterring-patients-seeking-medical-care/281-516aaf68-830b-47d4-a865-bf6490aa89a1).\n\n## Partnerships and Collaborations\n\nICHS collaborates with various organizations to enhance its service offerings. For instance, it partners with the Bellevue School District to provide school-based health services, ensuring that students have access to necessary healthcare [(efelle creative, 2024-12-20)](https://www.bsd405.org/about-us/news/news-details/~board/bsd-news/post/students-staff-and-community-partners-share-in-a-season-of-gratitude). Additionally, the organization is involved in community initiatives aimed at improving public safety and health equity in the CID [(Sharon Yoo, King 5, 2024-12-09)](https://www.king5.com/article/news/community/facing-race/violent-crime-cid-deterring-patients-seeking-medical-care/281-516aaf68-830b-47d4-a865-bf6490aa89a1).\n\n# Conclusion\n\nInternational Community Health Services plays a vital role in the healthcare landscape of Seattle, particularly for underserved populations. With a strong leadership team, ongoing development of new facilities, and a commitment to culturally competent care, ICHS is well-positioned to continue its mission of providing accessible healthcare to all.

      "# Post ID 1dlan15: About to lose my teeth and I can't afford the needed procedures to save them. Are there programs that can help here? with +277 score by [(acpom, Reddit, 2024-06-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1dlan15/about_to_lose_my_teeth_and_i_cant_afford_the/)\nSo, I have very severe gum recession all over my mouth to the point my roots are fully exposed in some areas. Some of my teeth are now loose and I'm panicking. To add to that all - it hurts.\n\nMy medical insurance can cover things if its caused by an accident and honestly I've debated intentionally falling to knock some out just for that reason. Otherwise my dental only covers $2000 a year of a $10,000 procedure that would need to happen within the next few months to save my teeth.\n\nI know Washington has medical insurance help, but are there any dental programs? This would be for a periodontist.\n\nUpdate: Thank you everybody. I've contacted UW and tried PIMA, but they were closed. I also was approved for Care Credit and have been looking into each of your recommendations for periodontists and dentists. Unfortunately I don't have the ability to travel internationally to have things done, though - I appreciate everybody's suggestions and insights about it though.\n\nYou've all been very helpful, thank you. <3\n\nUpdate: Surgery is next week! <3 <3 <3 <3 <3\n\n## Comment ID l9nm1re with +413 score by [(judithishere, Reddit, 2024-06-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1dlan15/about_to_lose_my_teeth_and_i_cant_afford_the/l9nm1re/) (in reply to ID 1dlan15):\nUW Dental School.  You will probably have to leave a message when you call, but they will call you back.  I had extensive dental work done there, 10's of thousands dollars worth, for a fraction of the cost.  Would recommend.  Only caveat is your appointments take a bit of time as the student will need to show an instructor the work during your appt so you have to schedule a block of time for each appt (think 2-3 hours)\n\n### Comment ID l9ojbys with +97 score by [(Fantastic_Elk7086, Reddit, 2024-06-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1dlan15/about_to_lose_my_teeth_and_i_cant_afford_the/l9ojbys/) (in reply to ID l9nm1re):\nThe students are awesome too, the guy I work with right now is by far the most gentle with my teeth out of any professional I’ve ever had work on my teeth.

It’s good you’re reaching out directly to periodontists, it sounds like you’ll need several gum grafts. It’s not the terrible surgery it use to be two decades ago, they’ve gotten pretty good at it these days. But if you need to have grafts on both sides of your mouth it makes eating for about a month or two very difficult, smoothies only basically. I recommend buying [Soylent](https://soylent.com/collections/meal-replacements) too, that’s stuff was a life saver. and absolutely nothing even slightly acidic, like no fruits that even have preservatives, unbelievable pain will ensue.\n\nFeel free to ask questions.\n\n### Comment ID l9shswm with +3 score by [(funchefchick, Reddit, 2024-06-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1dlan15/about_to_lose_my_teeth_and_i_cant_afford_the/l9shswm/) (in reply to ID l9p71b5):\nI wouldn’t bother with the BBB - I *would* consider reporting that dentist to the Washington State Dental Quality Assurance Commission, the licensing board for dentists in our state.

Neoliberalism puts the onus on the individual. I’ve been where you are. The only relief I found at the time was emergency extraction services at discount dental offices in the hood. I was raised to care for my teeth, had braces, had wisdom teeth removed, etc. I ended up paying $28k to have my teeth removed and implants placed and $30k for temps and permanent clip ins. My smile is beautiful but my face will never look as good as it did with natural bone structure. Yes I went to the UW clinic. Yes I applied for state insurance which does not cover extensive dental work. I had the mouth restoration done partially in Burien, WA and Palo Alto, CA.\n\n## Comment ID l9r1qj9 with +1 score by [(kobachi, Reddit, 2024-06-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1dlan15/about_to_lose_my_teeth_and_i_cant_afford_the/l9r1qj9/) (in reply to ID 1dlan15):\nWhy can’t you travel internationally?

      "# Post ID 1co3jw9: This Week in Destiny 05/09/2024 with +334 score by [(DTG_Bot, Reddit, 2024-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1co3jw9/this_week_in_destiny_05092024/)\nSource: https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/twid-05-09-2024\n\n---\n\nThis week in Destiny, we are talking a bit more about Exotic class items. We announced them along with the Prismatic subclass, and it's time we tell you more about this groundbreaking addition to Destiny 2—and that's just our first topic for the week! \n\n\n\n* More info about the new Exotic class items. \n* New boss profile for The Pantheon. \n* The red border weapons bonanza is here! \n* Zero Hour arrives next week. \n* Check out our new PvP maps trailer. \n* Enjoy Destiny 2: Expansion Open Access now through June 3! \n* The Gauntlet returns for its 10th anniversary \n* It's AANHPI Heritage Month. \n##A Matter of Exotic Class Items\n\n\nThis morning, we shared some amazing videos showcasing the Prismatic subclass coming with The Final Shape. Check them!\n\n\n####Warlock\n* [Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/embed/WY3GNEddJ-U)\n\n####Hunter\n* [Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/embed/G_zUYhy6UnE)\n\n####Titan\n* [Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/embed/h00Drr7UZ8o)\n\n\nAs you can see, you will not only have the new Aspects and Fragments coming with Prismatic, but also will get to further expand your options with the new Exotic class items. These are very special additions to Destiny 2 as each Exotic class item will have two random Exotic perks from a selection of existing Exotic armor perks, including some that belong to classes other than yours! \n\n\n###How to Earn Them \n\n\nThe Exotic Class items will be part of a new activity that unlocks after the Raid World First, at the beginning of Week 2.  We don’t want to spoil what the activity is all about or how to unlock it, but we can say it's farmable, and you will get a guaranteed random roll each time you complete it. \n\n\n###How Many Exotic Perks \n\n\nSimilar to how Prismatic has a selection of abilities among all Light and Darkness classes, the Exotic class items in The Final Shape will have a mix of Exotic armor perks available for each class. We included some fan favorites as well as some perks that aligned with the Prismatic abilities and Aspects. We also chose to put perks in each column that would compound with each other, allowing for combinations that felt powerful and complementary, such as a Warlock bond with Sprit of Apotheosis and Spirt of the Star-Eater. \n\n\n\nPrismatic is all about combining effects that used to belong to specific subclasses, and we wanted to bring that to the design of the Exotic class items, too. So, in many cases, we have adjusted the perks to work with a broader array of abilities. For example, Spirit of Caliban on the Hunter cloak works with all powered melees, not just Proximity Knife. \n\n\n\nTo keep things balanced, we have narrowed some of the perk effects to what we believe the spirit of (get it?) the original Exotic was. This allows the combination of two of them to not be overwhelming, and it maintains a reason to run the original Exotic armor. When a perk on the class item has the same effect as its original version you should expect some tuning changes. For example, in The Final Shape the original Armamentarium and Sixth Coyote will gain the ability to create Orbs of Light from your grenade and dodge respectively. \n\n\n   \n\nCheck out all the possible combos below! \n   \n\n\n###Hunter Exotic Cloak - Essentialism\n\nFirst Column|Second Column  \n|-|-|  \n|**SPIRIT OF THE ASSASSIN:** Finishers and powered melee final blows grant invisibility.|**SPIRIT OF THE STAR-EATER:** While your Super energy is full, picking up an Orb of Power overcharges your Super, granting it bonus damage.|\n|**SPIRIT OF THE INMOST LIGHT:** Using an ability empowers the other two abilities granting them improved energy regeneration. |**SPIRIT OF THE SYNTHOCEPS:** Improved melee damage when you're surrounded. |\n|**SPIRIT OF THE OPHIDIAN:** Weapons ready very quickly. |**SPIRIT OF VERITY:** Weapon final blows with a damage type matching your grenade grant a stacking grenade damage bonus. |\n|**SPIRIT OF THE DRAGON:** Using your class ability reloads all weapons and increases weapon handling speeds for a brief time. |**SPIRIT OF THE CYRTARACHNE:** Gain Woven Mail when you use your grenade. |\n|**SPIRIT OF GALANOR:** Hits and final blows with your Super will return Super energy after it ends. |**SPIRIT OF THE GYRFALCON:** Your Void weapons gain Volatile Rounds after you emerge from being invisible. |\n|**SPIRIT OF THE FOETRACER:** Damaging a powerful combatant or Guardian with an ability grants you a temporary damage bonus for weapons matching that ability's element. |**SPIRIT OF THE LIAR:** Dealing damage with a powered melee or being hit by a melee attack will allow you to follow up with an extremely powerful melee counterpunch. |\n|**SPIRIT OF CALIBAN:** Powered melee final blows trigger an ignition. |**SPIRIT OF THE WORMHUSK:** Dodging gives a small health and shield bump. |\n|**SPIRIT OF RENEWAL:** Allies inside the Duskfield take reduced damage, and targets inside the area deal reduced damage. |**SPIRIT OF THE COYOTE:** Gain an additional class ability charge. |\n\n   \n\n### Titan Exotic Mark - Stoicism\n\n|**First column**|**Second column**|\n|--|--|\n**SPIRIT OF THE ASSASSIN:** Finishers and powered melee final blows grant invisibility. |**SPIRIT OF THE STAR-EATER:** While your Super energy is full, picking up an Orb of Power overcharges your Super, granting it bonus damage. |\n**SPIRIT OF INMOST LIGHT:** Using an ability empowers the other two abilities, granting them improved energy regeneration |**SPIRIT OF SYNTHOCEPS:** Improved melee damage when you're surrounded. |\n**SPIRIT OF THE OPHIDIAN:** Weapons ready very quickly. |**SPIRIT OF VERITY:** Weapon final blows with a damage type matching your grenade grant a stacking grenade damage bonus. |\n**SPIRIT OF SEVERANCE:** Powered melee or finisher final blows unleash a damaging explosion. |**SPIRIT OF CONTACT:** Damaging a target with a powered melee causes all nearby enemies to suffer lightning strikes and become jolted. |\n**SPIRIT OF HOARFROST:** Your Barricade becomes a wall of Stasis crystals that slows nearby targets when created. |**SPIRIT OF SCARS:** Final blows with weapons that have a damage type matching your Super's element create a burst of healing around you that grants allies restoration. |\n**SPIRIT OF THE ETERNAL WARRIOR:** Gain a damage bonus for weapons matching your Super's element when your Super ends. |**SPIRIT OF THE HORN:** Your Barricade unleashes a blast of Solar energy that scorches targets |\n**SPIRIT OF THE ABEYANT:** Improves Drengr’s Lash.

However, we are also making a set of Exotic armor balance adjustments with the launch of The Final Shape, including some buffs that will impact both the original armor and its Spirit version. So, some of the class item perk combinations might end up being better than you expect. We’ll have more to share about Exotic armor balance in general in the coming weeks.\n\n\n\nWe hope the amazing combinations that the new Exotic class items will allow when using Prismatic have ignited your imagination and you are already wondering what builds will work best when The Final Shape arrives. Let us know, and please share your early build ideas with us.\n\n\n##Another God to Best in The Pantheon \n\n\nGuardians, you have shown the world again that, no matter who you face—be it one god or several—you will always prevail. Another of our greatest enemies entered The Pantheon this Tuesday, we hope this report helps with your task. \n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n**VANGUARD – GUARDIAN DISPATCH – ALL POINTS BULLETIN**\n\n\n\nDEFENDERS OF THE CITY, \n\n\n\nYou are tasked with the elimination of the following target: \n\n\n\n**- ORYX, THE TAKEN KING -** \n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blt5733363b5909b32b/663c7602aea329218360eb4a/2022_KingsFall_Raid_Press_Kit_Oryx_Compressed_003.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/OopeT7u.jpeg)\n\n**CLASSIFICATION** \n\n\n\n* Hive God \n* First Navigator and King of the Osmium Court \n* Brother to Savathûn and Xivu Arath \n* Father to Crota \n* Ex-Krill \n* Taken, Wielder \n\n**HAZARDS** \n\n\n\n* The power to Take \n* Willbreaker, Blade of Oryx \n* Commands Hive and Taken legions \n* Planar tearing \n* Corrupted Light \n* Darkness mastery \n* Godly strength and durability \n* Guardians rated Sigma-3 or lower are advised not to engage \n\n**INTEL** \n\n\n\n* Oryx was once known as Aurash, one of the three sisters of Krill nobility. She became Oryx upon descending into the Deep, accepting a worm, and choosing to shed her form in favor of the king morph. Oryx then began a crusade of conquest and death across the universe in pursuit of the Final Shape. \n* After invading Sol to seek vengeance for the death of his son, Crota, and winning a decisive victory at the battle of Saturn, Oryx was dethroned by a valiant fireteam who infiltrated the Dreadnaught and ended the Taken King. \n* Many Hive still tithe to Oryx in secret, though it is not known where the power of their tithes goes, given that the Taken King is dead. \n* After his defeat, Oryx’s corpse fell to Titan where the Lucent Hive attempted to resurrect him through the heretical use of necromancy, a crime for which Oryx once banished another of his sons, Nokris. This scheme was foiled by Guardian operatives. \n\n**OF NOTE** \n\n\n\n* Oryx slew Akka, the Worm of Secrets, and carved the Dreadnaught from its corpse. Hidden operatives report faint biosignatures still pulsing from within the ship’s hull. \n* Through the use of Willbreaker and the Dreadnaught, Oryx may weaponize his throne world, allowing it to spill into the material plane as a wave of destructive power. This weapon claimed the Awoken Fleet during the Battle of Saturn. \n* While imprisoned in the Dreaming City, Savathûn once claimed that her brother Oryx was unable to control his curiosity, that his worm intentionally directs it, and that the worm manipulates Oryx’s actions unbeknownst to him. She claims all Hive worms function in this way. The veracity of this claim is unconfirmed. \n* Eris Morn used Oryx’s Ravenous Heart to construct the Exotic weapon Touch of Malice. \n\n***\n\n\n##All the Deepsight Weapons You Can Get! \n\n\n[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blteee2e3972fc22e34/663c74ba1357525e2229d499/FrontPageBanner_PC_1920x590_TWIDRedBorder_050924.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/3ZQ1v7r.jpeg)\n\nWelcome, everyone, to the red border weapons bonanza! In a similar fashion to what we did last year, players who have not earned enough Deepsight weapons to unlock the Patterns of Year-6 Seasonal weapons now have the chance to catch up before The Final Shape launches. \n\n\n\nEvery day, from May 7 through June 3, players will get a guaranteed Deepsight weapon drop upon completion of a Seasonal activity. So, if you still have not unlocked the Pattern for, let's say, the Raconteur Bow from Season of Defiance, you can complete a Defiant Battleground to receive a Deepsight drop of that very weapon. You will get another the day after and another the day after that one, and so on until you have completed the Pattern. Don't worry much if you have more than one. If you keep playing, our knockout system will ensure you'll only get drops for those weapons. \n\n\n\nSo, what activities can you play from each Season to get these awesome rewards? \n\n\n\n* Season of Defiance \n\n\n\n   * Defiant Battlegrounds \n\n\n   * Mission AVALON \n\n\n* Season of the Deep \n\n\n\n   * Deep Dives \n\n\n   * Salvage \n\n\n* Season of the Witch \n\n\n\n   * Summoning Pools \n\n\n   * Savathûn's Spire \n\n\n* Season of the Wish \n\n\n\n   * Riven's Lair \n\n\n   * The Coil \n\n\n\nWe hope you have a great time revisiting some of the amazing activities that have defined this year of Destiny 2, all while you complete your weapons collection. \n\n\n##Zero Hour Is Near \n\n\n[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blt65e64c7a9b1f9c3e/663c76a4e5f2142a32ee2205/2024_Into_the_Light_Press_Kit_Zero_Hour_COMPRESSED_000.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/KhInoSH.jpeg)\n\nFirst came The Whisper, then it was Zero Hour. The second-ever Destiny 2 secret Exotic mission is coming back on May 14. You'll be able to find it in the Into the Light node in the Director, and it has a few surprises up its sleeve. \n\n\n\nThose capable enough to complete it before their time runs out (40 minutes on Normal and 20 minutes on Legend), will get the new craftable version of the Outbreak Perfected Exotic Pulse Rifle. Find some of the secret chests available each week to also unlock new additional perks for it. If you are looking for its Exotic catalyst, you'll have to complete Zero Hour on Legend difficulty, but remember that if you got the catalyst for the original version, you won't have to earn it again. That said, you will still want to do it to get the weekly Triumphs required to unlock the new Exotic ship. \n\n\n###And TR3-VR Is Near, Too... \n\n\nRemember TR3-VR, the overly attached&nbsp;robot that kept the Cryptarchy's vaults safe in Zero Hour? It was impossible to miss! So much joy, so many wonderful memories... Well, great news, everyone! He'll be back, too. \n\n\n\nTo celebrate his timely return, we would love it if you all shared your best moments with him: well-scripted videos, funny screenshots, fanart, comics, musical numbers... it's all on the table. And if this is your first time meeting him,  we can't wait to see your experiences. \n\n\n\nJust don't forget to use the **#MyFriendTR3VR** hashtag when sharing it on social media so we can see your creations and maybe pick a few to share in the future. Our favorite submissions could get the AOTW or MOTW emblems (don't forget to include your BungieID with your creation). \n\n\n##Three New PvP Maps in One Trailer \n\n\n[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blt13b378ceb7ecb595/66290d4fe7ce956b3cdea704/Crucible_FrontPageBanner_1920x590_1.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/AEfog54.jpeg)\n\nShaxx has been busy lately.

Everyone who participates in the playlist before The Final Shape goes live gets [an incredible Crucible-themed emblem!](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/twid-05-02-2024) \n\n\n##A Great Time to Jump Into Destiny 2\n\n\nIn anticipation of our battle with the Witness, we want everyone to be ready. And we really mean it. Starting May 7 and running through June 3, we have launched Destiny 2: Expansion Open Access period. \n\n[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/embed/yb80CvCeBjE)\n\nDuring those 28 days, the following contents will be **available to all players**: \n\n\n\n**Expansions** \n\n\n\n* Destiny 2: Shadowkeep \n* Destiny 2: Beyond Light \n* Destiny 2: The Witch Queen \n\n**Year-6 Seasons** \n\n\n\n* Destiny 2: Season of Defiance \n* Destiny 2: Season of the Deep \n* Destiny 2: Season of the Witch \n* Destiny 2: Season of the Wish \n\nPlayStation Plus members can also claim the Destiny 2: Lightfall, which will be available up until June 3.

When The Final Shape launches on June 4, the campaigns for Shadowkeep and Beyond Light along with the Stasis subclass will remain available to all players at no additional cost. \n\n\n\nIf you are looking to get everything else that the Shadowkeep and Beyond Light expansions have to offer beyond the campaigns, we will have two packs at your disposal, similar to the Forsaken Pack. \n\n\n\nThe Shadowkeep Pack grants access to: \n\n\n\n* 13 Exotic weapons \n* 3 Exotic armor pieces \n* The Scarlet Keep Nightfall \n* The Pit of Heresy dungeon \n* The Garden of Salvation raid \n\nThe Beyond Light Pack grants access to: \n\n\n\n* 12 Exotic weapons \n* 6 Exotic armor pieces \n* The Glassway and Proving Grounds Nightfalls \n* The Deep Stone Crypt raid \n\nOnce The Final Shape is live, we'll also launch a new pack called the Destiny 2: Legacy Collection 2024.

Your donations will fund free and low-cost health services for uninsured or underinsured ICHS patients who would otherwise be unable to afford them. \n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blt6261442718854d05/663c791c8447cb7dc99cc386/d1_210_emblem_social.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/UIbQJ7c.jpeg)\n\n[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blteaf70d466dc3f5b8/663c791d5f2485743bd0de15/Stand_With_Asians_1920x1080.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/FLqipKS.jpeg)\n###More about Asians@Bungie \n\n\nAsians@Bungie was founded at the end of 2021 in response to rising discrimination and violence against AANHPI communities. Their mission is to uplift their fellow AANHPI employees, to provide Bungie diverse insight int AANHPI cultures, and to support local AANHPI communities. \n\n\n###More about ICHS: \n\n\nICHS was formed in 1973 by young Asian American activists with the goal of disrupting systemic racism that denied healthcare to Asian immigrant communities. Today, ICHS remains deeply rooted in the Asian Pacific Islander community and continues to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate health services in more than 70 languages. This has significantly improved the wellness of King County’s diverse people and communities, regardless of patients’ ability to pay. \n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/bltef9c3ce997a3769a/663c79602a72d92387179a06/ICHS-Bungie-Blog-Photo-2023.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/I4YrNMK.jpeg)\n\nWe invite all allies to support the AANHPI communities by purchasing the Stand With Asians pin, which also comes with the Harmonic Waves emblem.

Players will be directed to speak to Shaxx during the last week of Into the Light. \n\n\n###Risky Archery Emote \n\n\nDue to an issue, the Risky Archery emote has been temporarily changed to use a different animation. Once the issue is fixed in a future update, the Risky Archery emote will return to its normal animation. \n\n\n###Player Privacy and Safety Update \n\n\nAs mentioned in our recent March 14 TWID, we are continuing with our efforts to ensure player privacy and safety online in Destiny 2. Our goal is to provide age-appropriate experiences to all our players and give the adults responsible for our younger players a way to tailor those players' experiences. If you haven’t already, please visit Bungie.net or use the prompt after launching Destiny 2 to update your date of birth. \n\n\n####Parental Controls \n\n\nIn May, parents, guardians, and other responsible adults will be able to adjust their child’s Destiny 2 settings.\n\n\n\nTo set up parental controls, both the child and their adult will need a Bungie.net account, and we will need to verify that the person providing consent and setting controls is an adult. We have created a [Parental Controls Help article](https://help.bungie.net/articles/24217906958868) with details explaining how to create an account and link it up to their child's.\n\n\n\nWe are also updating our [privacy policy](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Legal/privacypolicy) on May 14.

The individual packs are likely just meant for players who own one piece or another already to complete their package.

Current Osmiomancy is 10/22/34/50% depending on the tier of enemy with no cooldown while Contraverse is  2000% base ability regen for 1.75 seconds with a 4 second cooldown which ends up being somewhere around 12.5% per trigger with no kills.

At a bear minimum ALL of shadowkeep should be in there, that thing is so damn old at this point just make it default. And can we stop with multiple packs.

Some y1 strikes would be a good start. There wouldn't even be any need for unvaulting their whole destinations to make them available, since we have some examples of using the vaulted destinations for certain activities like the Salvage, or Mars Heist.\n\n## Comment ID l3bq0wn with +1 score by [(ReptileOfUnusualSize, Reddit, 2024-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1co3jw9/this_week_in_destiny_05092024/l3bq0wn/) (in reply to ID 1co3jw9):\nNo Spirit of Bakris, it's so over!\n\n## Comment ID l3bqind with +1 score by [(blamite, Reddit, 2024-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1co3jw9/this_week_in_destiny_05092024/l3bqind/) (in reply to ID 1co3jw9):\nMaking the Shadowkeep and Beyond Light campaigns going free would be a good excuse to put Nightmare and Empire Hunts into either the Vanguard playlist or a dedicated playlist of their own, and update the Moon and Europa weapons with origin traits.\n\n## Comment ID l3brpir with +1 score by [(Love-the-nuggets, Reddit, 2024-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1co3jw9/this_week_in_destiny_05092024/l3brpir/) (in reply to ID 1co3jw9):\nDoes anyone know if you can equip the exotic class item and a normal exotic armor piece at the same time?

He is new to Seattle and doesn't have a job nor health insurance. He has been experiencing severe stomach pain on and off for the last few months. The pain is severe enough to incapacitate him for an hour or two, until it subsidies. I believe he has an ulcer. I had one when I was younger and, if I remember correctly, his symptoms are very similar to what I had.  He doesn't feel like he can afford to go to a doctor for exam, tests, and medicine.  I can't bear to see my friend in such pain every few days or week. I want to help him with the costs of seeing a doctor.\n\nI'm not wealthy so, I would like to find some place that isn't going to end up costing me a fortune. Does anyone have any suggestions for an affordable place  where I can take my friend to get a medical examination and possibly, tests to diagnose what is causing this gastric pain?

I could be wrong but I’m p sure\n\n## Comment ID k68072k with +3 score by [(Asleep-Dog-2674, Reddit, 2023-10-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/17equnm/recommendations_for_where_to_go_for_medical_exam/k68072k/) (in reply to ID 17equnm):\nSea mar. In particular the one in white center is a large facility does same day appointments and most employees speak Spanish and English.  All their signage and paperwork is also available in both languages. They don’t care about citizenship or how much money you have. They’ll take care of you and only charge what you can afford. If you can’t afford anything you don’t have to pay. Edited to include link to their website available in Spanish \n\nhttps://www.seamar.org/es/\n\n## Comment ID k65n1ti with +2 score by [(Delicious-Adeptness5, Reddit, 2023-10-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/17equnm/recommendations_for_where_to_go_for_medical_exam/k65n1ti/) (in reply to ID 17equnm):\nI am going to make it easy since there is no income coming in and they just moved here.\n\n1. Go or call one of the [enrollment centers](https://www.wahealthplanfinder.org/us/en/tools-and-resources/connect-with-us/virtual-help-details.html) for the WA Healthplanfinder. \n2. They will enroll your friend into a Washington Apple Health Plan.\n3. Go to any clinic that accepts Apple Health for no cost.\n\nAs your friend's income changes, they can change their income which will change their plan or be offered a health plan from their employer. I use the enrollment centers because they don't charge fees and can answer a bunch of questions through the year.\n\n## Comment ID k67k4p1 with +2 score by [(CronusDinerGM, Reddit, 2023-10-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/17equnm/recommendations_for_where_to_go_for_medical_exam/k67k4p1/) (in reply to ID 17equnm):\nZoom Care has a couple of free nights per month with exactly what they offer on those nights mapped out on their website. I have insurance now so I still use their urgency room for most things bc it is so much cheaper than swedish. \n\nNeighborhood car is great and if you need dental there is a pretty good one on 105th and Hwy 99 that i used to use that I think is sliding scale. Hope this helps!\n\n## Comment ID k68om5e with +2 score by [(Panthean, Reddit, 2023-10-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/17equnm/recommendations_for_where_to_go_for_medical_exam/k68om5e/) (in reply to ID 17equnm):\nIf your friend doesn't have a job, they should definitely get apple health. It's free with no copays. Honestly I find it far superior to any other health insurance I've ever had.\n\nThe main problem with it is you lose the insurance if you start making basically any money at all.\n\n## Comment ID k6aojac with +2 score by [(th3st, Reddit, 2023-10-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/17equnm/recommendations_for_where_to_go_for_medical_exam/k6aojac/) (in reply to ID 17equnm):\nBastyr can do $15 checkups!\n\n\n\n\n\n## Comment ID k65sqkd with +1 score by [(elijuicyjones, Reddit, 2023-10-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/17equnm/recommendations_for_where_to_go_for_medical_exam/k65sqkd/) (in reply to ID 17equnm):\nSign up for the Washington ACA immediately. I’m pretty sure moving here counts as a qualifying factor for letting a person join, if not at least the signup period is coming up.

If you don't have insurance they offer services on a sliding scale. And I know Country Doctor also offers sliding scale medications through their pharmacy, I don't remember if Neighborcare does, but I wouldn't be surprised if they also do.\n\n## Comment ID k6c245g with +1 score by [(judithishere, Reddit, 2023-10-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/17equnm/recommendations_for_where_to_go_for_medical_exam/k6c245g/) (in reply to ID 17equnm):\nI just saw this on King County Public Health FB account:\n\n\"Starting Nov. 1, all Washingtonians, regardless of immigration status will be able to purchase health and dental insurance through Washington Healthplanfinder.

As within many large healthcare centers - there's a smorgasbord of different care providers with different egos, styles, and biases. If interpreters call out sick or the video interpreter machine doesn't work, your work gets a lot harder. Seems to try to stretch everyone. Supervisors are also overloaded, lots of geriatric patients here from the nursing home that is located near the clinic. Lot of complicated patients with cultural and language barriers here. \r\n\r\nBased on reviewing medical records of patients, the provider that I replaced was here for about 1 year before he left. I saw about 2-3 other names of people who used to work there. However, there are some people who have been around for a LONG time. As with many work environments, there's some politics as play, lots of ego.\r\n\r\nIt was hard because as I was getting credentialed, I had to have someone else sign off on my charts who was credentialed. The feedback was helpful at times, but it was just too much. Some of the providers disagreed with each other on the feedback. It just my life that much harder on top of everything else. \r\n\r\nI think a coworker I used to know has also left that place within the last few months. Midlevels seem to have an uphill battle here. They typically need locums for coverage. You have to get credentialed for everything and getting credentialed takes forever.",

Or they have been re-orged out of the organization because of the many changes in the management structure.  I have never seen a management team turnover this high in any organization I have worked in.  Original ideas are not accepted and there is no possibility of meaningful discussions or raising legitimate concerns.  Top management cuts people off in mid-sentence and is very disrespectful so therefore, there is a general feeling of dislike and disrespect throughout the organization.  What is left is a management team that is afraid to talk in meetings, afraid to lead and afraid to challenge poor ideas and leadership.",

The pay rate of this company is atrocious! I have seen senior employees who have been here 20+ years get the same pay as someone who has only been here under 5 years. Its ridiculous. Pay us more! Stop sending out stupid annual promises of a pay increase and it is only a few cents! What a slap in the face. You guys can have that since it looks like you're hurting so much you can't even pay your employees a livable wage! Despicable! PAY US MORE!!!!!

It just my life that much harder on top of everything else. \r\n\r\nI think a coworker I used to know has also left that place within the last few months.

Over the past two months, she has consistently spoken to me and the staff in a condescending manner, treating us as if we are incapable of making decisions or taking the lead. Additionally, she tends to rely on expensive vendors rather than leveraging the expertise of her knowledgeable staff to make informed decisions.",

In my extensive experience in the industry, I have not encountered a more challenging CIO. She has already terminated four employees and is considering another dismissal soon. Despite lacking a technical background or knowledge, she frequently makes hasty decisions without consulting her knowledgeable staff. This creates an environment of fear among team members who may disagree with her decisions.",

      "# [ICHS and ICHS Foundation Welcome our New Board Members by efelle creative](https://www.ichs.com/news/welcome-our-new-board-members)\nNew ICHS Foundation Board Members\n\nRaj Sidhu | ICHS Foundation Board Director\n\nRaj Sidhu, a dynamic entrepreneur and tech enthusiast, is the founder and President of inTech Consulting, LLC. Leading this Managed I.T. Services company, Raj specializes in providing comprehensive technological support to businesses, adeptly addressing their diverse challenges in the digital landscape. Having embarked on his academic journey at Eastern Washington University, Raj earned his bachelor’s degree, laying the foundation for his illustrious career. Eager to expand his expertise, he pursued various certificates at the esteemed University of Washington, focusing on cutting-edge subjects like Cybersecurity and Risk Management.\n\nWith over a decade of experience in the field, Raj's professional journey commenced long before the inception of inTech Consulting. Over the course of 13 years, he honed his skills in I.T., navigating through diverse technical and management roles, which equipped him with invaluable insights and expertise. Beyond his professional endeavors, Raj is deeply committed to serving his community. Actively engaged in various boards, he channels his passion for philanthropy by volunteering alongside his family for local causes. Their efforts, including supporting food banks in distributing essentials to the needy, reflect Raj's dedication to making a tangible impact where it matters most.\n\nOutside the realm of technology and community service, Raj finds solace and joy in the great outdoors. Whether scaling the majestic peaks of the mountains or gliding down snow-covered slopes, he cherishes moments spent with his loved ones amidst nature's grandeur. An avid sports enthusiast, Raj imparts his love for adventure and athleticism to his children, teaching them the art of snowboarding and bonding over weekly soccer matches in a cherished father-daughter/son league.\n\nDriven by an unwavering passion for life, Raj embodies a commitment to excellence and a fervent desire to effect positive change in his local community and beyond.\n\nBetty Wong | ICHS Foundation Board Director\n\nBetty Wong, a second-generation Chinese American, was born and raised in the SF Bay Area, California. She earned a BS in Chemical Biology from UC Berkeley and concurrently pursued a minor in Global Poverty. As part of her minor, she completed a public health-focused capstone project centered on understanding the impact of behaviors on the spread of infectious diseases in rural villages in Sichuan, China. The aim was to integrate these findings into programs designed to mitigate disease prevalence. Subsequently, she pursued a PhD at Caltech, focusing on Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics. During her graduate studies, she developed a STEM project-based learning tool tailored for K-12 students, which gained adoption in multiple schools, with the first adoption occurring in underserved populations.\n\nIn 2019, Betty moved to Seattle to be closer to her sister. Initially, she worked as a patent strategist and practitioner at Perkins Coie, and then most recently worked at Delfi Diagnostics as their Strategy and Business Development Manager. In this capacity, she contributed to the development and commercialization of affordable cancer screening tests, aimed at promoting health equity. In her leisure time, Betty enjoys playing tennis and traveling.\n\n“Joining the ICHS board represents more than just a commitment to an organization; it embodies a deeply personal connection to the community and a dedication to the principles of accessible healthcare. Growing up, I witnessed firsthand how language barriers could hinder access to essential services, contrasting starkly with the accessibility enabled by the absence of such barriers. My frequent visits to my grandparents and grand-aunt who lived in Chinatown, San Francisco illuminated the profound impact organizations like ICHS can have on the lives of individuals and families.\n\n“At its core, ICHS symbolizes more than a healthcare provider; it serves as a beacon of hope and inclusivity for residents of the International District and the greater Seattle areas. Its enduring commitment to affordable healthcare surpasses mere medical assistance; it nurtures a sense of belonging and security in a community often marginalized by systemic inequities.\n\n“Joining the Foundation board offers an opportunity to pay homage to my upbringing and give back to a community that has profoundly influenced my identity. By drawing on my experiences and insights, I aim to contribute meaningfully to ICHS's mission of ensuring that every family it serves, across all generations, receives the care and support they deserve.”\n\nHannah Wong | ICHS Foundation Board Director\n\nHannah Wong joined the ICHS Foundation Board in November 2023. She is grateful to her parents, who raised her in a multicultural household, which has helped her see the world through a wide lens. Being part Japanese and Singaporean, she was always immersed in a variety of food, culture, languages, and traditions. This gave her a great appreciation of being part of a community early on.\n\nHannah graduated with a master's in health administration at the University of Washington in 2022 and completed an Administrative Fellowship at MultiCare Health System in Tacoma. Post-fellowship, she has been in a dual role, serving as administrative program manager and interim operations manager at Mary Bridge Children's (pediatric hospital and network within MultiCare). In her free time, she loves to go try out new restaurants with my family and friends and play with her dog, Charlie.\n\n“In the summer of 2023, I was given the opportunity to tour a few ICHS facilities in the International District with my other Asian Healthcare Leaders Community members as part of WA ACHE. I was inspired by the work ICHS is doing to advocate for health as a basic human right and the compassionate providers and administrators leading this organization. Growing up in a multicultural household and being an immigrant, I have watched friends and family navigate through the complex education and healthcare systems in this country.\n\n“Part of what I feel is my purpose being in healthcare is to promote culturally and linguistically appropriate care so that our community can have better lived experiences. I wish I had known about ICHS sooner, but since I can’t go back in time, I was very excited about the opportunity to get more involved and be even more connected to my community in this way. Having had the opportunity to work and volunteer at several organizations with various cultures, I have learned that in any organization, the core of the work is relationship-building, and everyone I've met at ICHS has exemplified that value as well. I am so excited for the work I get to be a part of to be better stewards of our community.”\n\nNew ICHS Board Members\n\nFatima Noble | Clinic Board Director\n\nFatima Noble works as the Human Resources Manager at Concessions International in SeaTac Airport.

      "# [Violent crime in CID deterring patients from seeking medical care by Sharon Yoo on 2024-12-09](https://www.king5.com/article/news/community/facing-race/violent-crime-cid-deterring-patients-seeking-medical-care/281-516aaf68-830b-47d4-a865-bf6490aa89a1)\nSEATTLE — Violence continues to grip Seattle's Chinatown-International District.\n\nFive people were shot outside of a hookah lounge in the 800 block of South Lane Street early Saturday morning. In early November, a man was charged in connection to stabbing at least four people at the intersection of 12th and Jackson in Little Saigon.\n\nAll of this news hasn't been so encouraging for Dominic Lee, who is a CID regular.\n\n\"I should say maybe twice a week?\" Lee said when asked how often he finds himself down at CID. \"A lot of times I come down here for the restaurants for the food.\"\n\nLee also comes to the CID for healthcare at the International Community Health Services clinic. The ICHS clinic is where he found a doctor who looks like him, more than 10 years ago.\n\n\"I like to try to get an Asian doctor, maybe we can communicate better,\" Lee said.\n\nHe added that when he comes for his appointments, he's aware of his surroundings.\n\n\"It is an easy target, especially for elderlies because Asians tend to carry cash instead of credit card,\" Lee explained. \"So easy to rob and grab the money and they don't fight.\"\n\nLee said recent news of violence has given him pause about his visits.\n\n\"I do think sometimes I want to go other places besides here, but I like the staff here and I want to stick with my primary care doctor,\" he said.\n\nICHS serves over 30,000 patients across all of its clinics. More than 10,000 seek care at the CID location, where staff have devoted more than half a century to marginalized communities. The clinic started as a place to help underprivileged Asian American Pacific Islander folks, but in 2024, the clinic is open to and serves everyone.\n\nICHS CEO Kelli Nomura said some patients have stopped coming to their CID location.\n\n\"We're here because everyone deserves access to healthcare,\" Nomura said, calling the situation \"frustrating.\" \"But they have to know it's a safe place to come.\"\n\nLast month, Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell announced a public safety executive order days after a stabbing left multiple people injured in Little Saigon, blocks away from ICHS. The executive order included the implementation of the DAT, the Downtown Activation Team, which Harrell said would be devoted to reducing crime in downtown Seattle.\n\n\"Reduce gun violence in high impact crime areas, respond to the most serious and dangerous situations,\" Harrell promised in his November press conference.\n\nThe preliminary numbers, according to Harrell's office, are showing promise.\n\n\"We’ve seen positive early results of the pilot in downtown, including a projected 27% decrease in violent crime, and are evaluating preliminary data from the expanded efforts in the CID and Little Saigon,\" a spokesperson said in a statement from the mayor's office.\n\nSeattle police data also shows that violent crime is down in the CID by 13%. Other nearby areas, though, like Pioneer Square and the downtown commercial district, are down by 20% or more.\n\n\"With any place-based strategy, there is an expected degree of migration and movement of people; however, our approach makes it clear that it is unacceptable for any one community to bear the brunt of street disorder and crime,\" the mayor's office statement read in part. \"We will continue to monitor the data and the conditions on the street to determine the areas and neighborhoods where there is a need for scheduled restoration actions and will expand the DAT model to other neighborhoods if needed.\"\n\nNomura said ever since the announcement of the pilot, she has seen some changes in the area of the clinic.\n\n\"We have seen a little more presence, and we'd certainly like to see more and we'd certainly like to see them be more responsive when an activity happens,\" Nomura said.\n\nAs for Dominic Lee, when asked if he thinks the CID has been ignored in terms of public safety, his answer was clear.\n\n\"I have to say yes,\" he said. \"Yes, because a lot of times you can see the crimes that keep repeating and see all the folks hanging out here waiting for opportunities.\"\n\nIn terms of additional public safety, efforts from the pilot project are outlined in the statement from the mayor's office below:\n\n\"In recent months, SPD has made a significant number of arrests near 12th & Jackson and Hoa Mai Park for violation of park rules, illegal firearm possession, drug possession, and outstanding warrants as part of their emphasis patrol in downtown neighborhoods. SPD will continue with these increased patrols and now have the capacity and flexibility to book misdemeanor offenses in King County Jail from the new agreement with King County. This is a significant step to hold offenders accountable for the harm they are causing in our communities and increase public safety.\n\nIn addition to increasing law enforcement presence, we will also continue to support community-based solutions, new evidence-based technology, neighborhood activation, enhanced lighting, and beautification efforts to prevent crime. Many efforts are located in the CID: the new technology pilot will deploy more tools like CCTV cameras and a Real Time Crime Center to prevent and solve crimes in the neighborhood; we’ve added canopy lights to enhance the safety of Hing Hay Park and are planning to install more at other locations in the neighborhood; our office is working with Friends of Little Saigon on the Phố Đẹp, Beautiful Neighborhood, an initiative that focuses on community-led environmental design improvements to prevent crime; and we have launched a partnership with Uplift Northwest for graffiti removal and abatement on public and private property in the neighborhood.\n\nThese current efforts build on our ongoing commitment to enhance safety in the CID. The City has reduced tent encampments in the neighborhood significantly and has offered enhanced cleaning services of streets and alleys over the last three years. Mayor Harrell will continue to advance innovative, effective, and proactive solutions to make the Chinatown-International District a safe, thriving neighborhood for all.\"",

We are thankful for the students, staff and community partners that allow us to thrive and grow. Despite challenges that may come our way, together we can continue to create schools and learning environments where compassion and inspiration flourish.\n\nGratitude for Our Community Partners\n\nBellevue LifeSpring\n\nBellevue LifeSpring, in partnership with the Bellevue School District, operates the Bellevue Family Hub locations at Highland Middle School and Stevenson Elementary. The Hub serves as a centralized space where families can meet with trained LifeSpring volunteers to connect with essential resources. In addition, the Hub partners with other community organizations to provide learning opportunities that support adults and teens with workshops that support their academic, career and financial futures.\n\nLifeSpring volunteers recently decorated Mary’s Place Family Shelter. Their efforts have made the season bright and festive for many of our students and families.\n\nBoys and Girls Clubs of Bellevue\n\nFor more than 70 years, Boys and Girls Clubs of Bellevue (BGCB) has provided safe spaces for youth when not in school. The BGCB serves over 12,000 youth in Bellevue between the ages of 3 and 18 with programming focused on academics, health and leadership. They operate school-based clubs, teen centers, a clubhouse and three clubs within public housing communities.\n\nRecently, Seattle Seahawks safety Julian Love visited our Lake Hills Clubhouse to unveil “Love’s Huddle.” In partnership with BGCB and UnitedHealthcare Community Health Plan of Washington, he provided the clubhouse with a washer, dryer, and a stocked hygiene locker to help students who use the space feel confident.\n\nInternational Community Health Services\n\nThe Bellevue School District is fortunate to have a school-based health center at Highland Middle School, in partnership with International Community Health Services (ICHS). ICHS began as an all-volunteer clinic in Seattle’s International District fifty years ago and has now expanded to multiple locations throughout the region — providing health care services to thousands of patients annually.\n\nThe Highland Health Center is open to all BSD students and provides treatment of illness, injuries and ongoing health conditions, in addition to well-child visits and immunizations. ICHS and BSD also partner with Youth Eastside Services at the Highland Health Center to provide support for mental health and substance use concerns.\n\nJubilee REACH\n\nThe mission of Jubilee REACH is to bring healing, build community, and transform the lives of students and families in Bellevue. In partnership with BSD, Jubilee REACH site coaches develop relationships with students before, during and after school. In elementary and middle schools, this involves athletics and activities programs. At the high school level, site coaches engage with students and provide social, emotional and academic support.\n\nAt the Jubilee REACH center, qualified families receive assistance with rent, utilities and food support. The center offers before and after-school care, tutoring as well as beginning, intermediate and advanced-level language classes for adults who speak a first language other than English.\n\nThank you to the Jubilee Elves who recently supported Bellevue families in four different areas: the Groceries for Families program, Before and After School program, families served by NISO, and other families throughout the Bellevue School District.\n\nRainier Athletes\n\nRainier Athletes provides BSD students with unique wraparound mentoring that includes support from their school, community, family, coach and mentor. Dedicated mentors are paired with students and build relationships to foster greater confidence, advocacy and engagement both in and out of the classroom. Rainier Athletes supports and mentors over 100 BSD students across several school locations. In addition, they work with community sports leagues and other youth-focused organizations to cover the cost of participation, registration for youth programs, and coordination of transportation as needed.\n\nReflecting on her first year as a Rainier Athlete’s Program Manager, Taylor McGhee states that she is “excited to continue supporting families in the Bellevue School District as we unite every student's community of parents, teachers, and coaches!”\n\nYouth Eastside Services\n\nYouth Eastside Services (YES) is an Eastside behavioral health services provider for children and youth through the age of 22. They provide prevention, diagnosis and treatments for mental health and substance use disorders. There are more than fifty YES locations in East King County, and the Bellevue School District is fortunate to partner with YES to provide free on-site, dually licensed mental health and substance use counselors to support student mental health and well-being. School year services and programs include support groups, screenings, assessments, referrals, parent education and alcohol and drug education classes for those needing intervention.\n\nIn addition to the partners listed above, the Bellevue School District shares our gratitude to the numerous community organizations that support Bellevue School District families by providing direct access to supports and services including: Backpack Meals for Kids, Hopelink, KidVantage (formerly Eastside Baby Corner), Mary’s Place, and Treehouse.\n\nGratitude for Our Students, Staff and Families\n\nDuring this season of giving, Bellevue school district students came together to support their peers and communities. For the fourth consecutive year, students in the PACIFIC program at Interlake High School along with students in Interlake Cheer, Sparkle Cheer and Interlake Robotics gathered donations and created food bags that support over 150 students across the district.\n\n“Measuring a school's impact extends beyond the academic achievements of the classroom and additionally encompasses the compassion and empathy for the community that it represents” – Bret Cochrun, Interlake High School Principal\n\nAt Highland Middle School, leadership students also held a drive to collect food and essential hygiene items. The donations will support students in the Highland community as well as through the Renewal Food Bank.\n\nStudents at International School recently concluded their annual Snowflake Food Drive. Donations support Hopelink’s Food Program which operates five food markets including a location in Bellevue, where shoppers enrolled in the Food Assistance Program can select items that best fit the needs of their household.\n\nDistrict staff recently took part in a toy drive in support of our learning community. Staff brought in hundreds of new unwrapped toys for students in partnership with Jubilee Reach.\n\nGratitude for the Bellevue Schools Foundation\n\nFunding for many critical district programs and events is provided through the Bellevue Schools Foundation. For over 45 years, the Bellevue Schools Foundation has promoted and funded a multitude of learning opportunities for students. Learn more about the impact BSF has had on district schools in their annualImpact Report.\n\nAs we look to the year ahead, we are excited to build on the incredible work of our partners and continue to support the needs of students and families.

      "# [Kelli Nomura, ICHS CEO Named Diversity Champion by N.A.P Contributor on 2024-12-16](https://napost.com/2024/news1-12132024/)\nBy International Community and Health Services\n\nNAP Contributor\n\nKelli Nomura, ICHS CEO, was named Diversity Champion.\n\nInternational Community Health Services (ICHS) Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Kelli Nomura, has been named Diversity Champion and selected as one of 15 preeminent health care leaders of the Puget Sound region in Washington State by the Puget Sound Business Journal (PSBJ). “Kelli Nomura has proven to be committed to working to achieve health equity,” said Alice Braverman, ICHS Foundation Executive Director. “She is well known for her advocacy to remove barriers to care. Nomura works to create a continuum of quality health services that advocates for health access for low-income people.”\n\nThe PSBJ launched the annual Health Care Leadership Awards in 2019. The program recognizes doctors, researchers, administrators and executives whose work provides models on how care can be delivered, and tools for the prevention and alleviation of illness. The awards recognize innovative and influential thinkers whose leadership has an indelible impact on the region.\n\nNomura has been a health care and community leader in the Puget Sound area for over 30 years. Prior to her appointment as ICHS’ CEO in 2022, she served on the ICHS Board of Directors for over 10 years with an emphasis on strategic planning and community relations. Nomura wanted to gain awareness of other areas of the medical health system for Seattle communities particularly the AAPI (Asian American Pacific Islander) community. “I have been connected to or interested in the integration of behavioral health with medical care because I believe that it is so important to treat the whole person and not separate treatment of the head from the body,” Nomura said. “[ICHS is] committed to providing those services in a culturally and linguistically appropriate way. We serve everyone, that is really where our mission is. [We make] sure that the community, AAPI community as well as immigrants and refugees who do not have access to health care [or] have a place to go.”\n\nICHS is a federally qualified community health center that has been at the forefront of advancing health equity for low-income, uninsured, and immigrants and refugees in King County regardless of language or financial barriers. In 2023, ICHS served 31,230 patients. Four out of five of them were low-income and seven out of nine were people of color. ICHS welcomes all people regardless of language, immigration status or financial barriers.\n\nEarlier this year, ICHS was awarded the Health Center Quality Leader Gold Badge from the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) for its clinical quality performance and ability to improve health outcomes.\n\n“Under Nomura’s leadership, ICHS has been able to adapt to the pandemic and post-pandemic needs of the communities we serve,” said Braverman. Nomura has also overseen the continuing development and planning of the new Ron Chew Healthy Aging and Wellness Center, which offers a 25,000-square-foot space to provide services to the community. It plans to open in Seattle in 2025. When completed, the center will quadruple the number of vulnerable older adults served at ICHS.\n\nPrior to joining ICHS as CEO, Nomura served as division director for the Behavioral Health and Recovery Division of King County’s Department of Community and Human Services in Seattle. She was dedicated to ensuring access to high-quality behavioral health services for low-income people of all ages in King County. Nomura was responsible for mental health and substance use disorder prevention, intervention and treatment services with a focus on recovery, as well as the management of the Mental Illness and Drug Dependency Behavioral Health sales tax revenues. Under her leadership, King County assumed the role of managing and coordinating the King County Integrated Care Network of Providers, enhancing consumer choice for behavioral health services county-wide. She also took on direct responsibility for serving as the Administrative Service Organization for the region coordinating the county’s crisis response services and access to care.\n\nPrior to joining King County in 2016, Nomura worked over 30 years in clinical and leadership roles within the behavioral health provider network. She also holds a master’s degree in Business Administration and a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology, both from the University of Washington. This is where she connected with the King County behavioral health organization and where she would eventually work after graduating.\n\nNomura grew up outside of Portland, Oregon. Her father was a physician, so she learned early on the importance of health care and preventative health, as well as the importance of access to health care. From a young age, she knew she wanted to work in the field of health.",

He also served as executive director of the Wing Luke Museum for 17 years.\n\nThe new center—at 1200 12th Avenue South—will deliver comprehensive, affordable wraparound services, maximize quality of life for families, and keep our community elders healthy by meeting individual patients’ healthcare needs in one place.\n\nICHS CEO Kelli Nomura. “This new state-of-the-art senior care facility will give families across our community peace of mind knowing every day that their loved one is supported by an integrated team that truly cares. This effort represents a commitment to our elders in a way that honors Ron Chew’s legacy in remembering and caring for those who paved the way for us.”",
      "# [Celebrating the opening of Beacon Pacific Village by Allison Rose, DEI Creative in Seattle on 2024-11-14](https://www.weberthompson.com/beacon-pacific-village-opening/)\nWe recently gathered with partners, community leaders, and residents to celebrate a major milestone – the opening of Beacon Pacific Village. An inter-generational affordable housing project located on the historic Pacific Hospital campus in Seattle’s Beacon Hill neighborhood, this development isn’t just about housing, it’s about creating a place where families and individuals can thrive.\n\nWith 160 units for households earning 50%–60% of the Area Median Income (AMI), Beacon Pacific Village aims to provide stability and community, offsetting some of the displacement in the surrounding International District, Chinatown, and Beacon Hill neighborhoods.\n\nBy design, Beacon Pacific Village also delivers critical on-site services. Families have access to the Jose Marti Child Development Center, operated by El Centro de la Raza, while seniors benefit from the Ron Chew Healthy Aging and Wellness Center, managed by International Community Health Services (ICHS). This holistic approach ensures support for residents across generations, turning housing into a true community hub.\n\nBringing Beacon Pacific Village to life required deep collaboration. The Pacific Hospital PDA recognized the link between housing and their public health mission and saw the opportunity on an underutilized portion of their campus. The Seattle Chinatown International District PDA (SCIDpda) led the charge, managing development and community engagement, alongside Edge Developers, architect Weber Thompson, and general contractor Marpac Construction. Generous financial support came from JPMorgan Chase, Bellwether Enterprise, the City of Seattle, King County, Washington State, and Amazon’s Housing Equity Fund.\n\n“Everyone involved is invested in the mission of providing housing that allows families of all incomes to remain part of the Seattle community. It’s this shared passion and commitment that has enabled us to stay on budget, while making choices that will provide a beautiful and sustainably built place for folks to call home.”\n\n– Stephanie Farrell, Associate\n\nDuring the ceremony, SCIDpda Co-Executive Director Jamie Lee stated, “It’s been a long journey to bring this project to life, and it’s taken the dedication of so many entities and individuals to make it a reality.”\n\nThe opening also carries a sense of justice and healing for the International District community, still affected by the bisection of I-5 through the district in the 1960s and by I-90 in the 1990s. SCIDpda worked with community partners, including CISC, Interim CDA, and Horn of Africa Services, to ensure affordable housing opportunities reach those who need them most.\n\nThe thoughtful design of Beacon Pacific Village prioritizes connection, health, and wellness for its residents. The in-city location could have easily suffered from freeway and flight path noise and pollution, but triple-paned windows, Energy Recovery Ventilation, and well-insulated interior and exterior walls provide residents with thermal and acoustic comfort and healthy indoor air year-round. These same resident health “amenities” create a very green building with long-term operational savings.\n\nThe development’s central courtyard includes a large playground for childcare that can be enjoyed by residents in the off hours, bringing laughter and life to the heart of the community. Having childcare and senior care on site fosters bonds across generations and every detail, from materials to acoustics, supports both the young and the elderly. Over 20 percent of the units are family-sized, with 3- or 4-bedrooms. These units were the first to be leased, further evidence of the demand for affordable family housing in the region.\n\nSCIDpda plans for a second phase to the development that will include an additional 115-unit building. When Phase 2 is completed, the two six-story buildings will share outdoor common spaces with their adult care and childcare partners.\n\nReflecting on the excitement during the ribbon cutting ceremony, Weber Thompson appreciates that this project wouldn’t have been possible without the collaboration of our project partners.\n\n“Beacon Pacific Village isn’t just a building; it’s a promise for a stronger, more inclusive future. To every partner, supporter, and community member who made this possible—thank you.”",

      "# [Navigating isolation: The silent struggles of caring for immigrant elders in the U.S. by Rachel Boyoung Kim on 2024-12-18](https://www.king5.com/article/news/community/facing-race/caregiving-immigrant-elders-united-states/281-64420b65-1ebc-4021-9efe-7ae49afba495)\nSEATTLE — By 2060, foreign-born older adults will make up nearly a quarter of the United States' older population, according to data from the Census Bureau.\n\nImmigrant families face unique challenges when it comes to navigating the elder care system. Language barriers and cultural differences make it more difficult to access resources and stay connected to their community as people age. This means adult child caretakers often face heavier burdens when looking after their immigrant parents in their old age.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Sam Ly and his mother, Ha, moved to the United States.\n\n\"When Vietnam fell for the communists in 1975 ... we left through a boat at the time,\" Sam said. \"There were about 200 people that could cram underneath the deck.\"\n\nThrough an Italian humanitarian mission, the two made it to Seattle when Sam was 14, where they reside to this day.\n\nHe recalls the challenges of helping himself and his mother navigate this new experience started early.\n\n\"We were forced to grow up a lot faster,\" Sam said. \"I learned that we have to become caregivers very early on. You end up worrying a lot more than any teenager at the time should be.\"\n\nHe said it was particularly hard to fully translate medical technical terms and act as a go-between for his mother and medical doctors.\n\nSam's mother, Ha, is now 88 years old. She is also battling stage 3 dementia.\n\n\"He's very important,\" she said. \"I depend on (Sam) for everything.\"\n\nSam explained that it's \"almost taboo\" in his culture to send elderly parents to a senior home.\n\n\"You will do your best to care for them as long as you can,\" Sam said.\n\n“My mom means a lot to me …She raised me pretty much on her own. I will try to reciprocate the same type of unconditional love to her to make her as comfortable as she can be.”\n\nPsychologist Dr. Sally Chung explained that the concept of Filial Piety is a strongly held value in many Asian cultures. Derived from Confucianism, it means children are obligated to care for their elders the way their elders cared for them in childhood.\n\n\"We look at cultural values of familialism, cultural values of Filial Piety, and we layer on top of that the immigrant experience... you're told as a child, the family is all you have,\" Chung said. \"It can help be a positive thing because you're upholding tradition, but this value can be a burden.\"\n\nCaregivers of foreign-born adults report more care burden than caregivers of U.S. born older adults, according to the National Institutes of Health.\n\nChung said professionals see higher rates of depression and anxiety in the child caregivers of immigrant parents.\n\n\"I experienced, you know, a different level of depression,\" Sam said. \"I can't say I've talked about a lot of this emotion with my mom. It will make her more guilty, or make myself more guilty.\"\n\nSam said over the years, his mother's isolation has increased, especially with the passing of her friends.\n\n\"I do feel lonely at home,\" Ha said. \"I feel helpless. But there is nothing I can do to change the situation.\"\n\nSam said he believes his mother still carries a fear of being abandoned, stemming from her past. He shouldered the challenges of caring for his aging mother, navigating her progressing disease, and not knowing where to turn to.\n\n\"I think I underestimated the help that I need,\" Sam said. \"It's not common to ask for this kind of help.\"\n\nNumbers from the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health estimate that there are around 45 million people serving as unpaid caregivers in the United States.\n\nAshley Van Oeveren with the International Community Health Services Program for All-Inclusive Care (ICHS PACE) said many immigrant families underestimate the help that's available in caring for their elderly loved ones. ICHS PACE offers resources for elderly immigrants and their caregivers.\n\n\"They have a fear of being a drain on the hospital system,\" Van Oeveren said. \"So, they feel kind of stuck and isolated.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Sam was able to find support both for his mother, and for his own mental health.\n\n\"The Paid Caregiver Program definitely helped,\" he said.\n\nHe has been able to connect his mother with others her age who speak the same language. He said he would recommend other immigrant families look into accessing this type of help.\n\n\"It definitely will ease the anxiety,\" Sam said. \"(That) will improve the level of help that you can provide.\"\n\nExplore the links below for more information about available elder care resources:",
