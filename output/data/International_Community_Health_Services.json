  "summary_markdown": "# About International Community Health Services\n\nInternational Community Health Services (ICHS) is a federally qualified community health center based in Seattle, Washington. Founded over 50 years ago, ICHS is dedicated to providing high-quality, accessible healthcare to underserved populations, particularly immigrants and refugees. The organization operates 11 locations and serves over 31,000 patients annually, with a significant focus on the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities [(Kelli Nomura, N.A.P, 2024-12-16)](https://napost.com/2024/news1-12132024/). \n\nICHS offers a wide range of healthcare services, including primary care, dental care, behavioral health, and health education. The organization is committed to health equity, ensuring that all individuals, regardless of language, immigration status, or financial barriers, have access to necessary healthcare services [(ICHS, 2024-12-21)](https://iexaminer.org/ichs-give-the-gift-of-help-to-people-in-need/). \n\nThe organization generates revenue primarily through patient services, with 47% of its patients on Medicaid insurance plans [(ICHS, 2024-12-09)](https://www.king5.com/article/news/community/facing-race/violent-crime-cid-deterring-patients-seeking-medical-care/281-516aaf68-830b-47d4-a865-bf6490aa89a1). ICHS has been recognized for its cost-effective and high-quality care, being ranked as Washington State’s No. 1 community health center in Medicaid Cost and Quality by the Washington Health Alliance in their 2024 Community Checkup report [(ICHS, 2024-12-09)](https://www.king5.com/article/news/community/facing-race/violent-crime-cid-deterring-patients-seeking-medical-care/281-516aaf68-830b-47d4-a865-bf6490aa89a1).\n\nICHS has evolved over time to meet the changing needs of its community, particularly during the pandemic, and has launched initiatives aimed at improving health outcomes, such as increasing HIV screenings and opening an after-hours clinic [(ICHS, 2024-11-13)](https://iexaminer.org/what-its-like-to-run-an-after-hours-clinic-in-south-seattle/). The organization is also involved in community development projects, including a mixed-use development that will feature affordable housing and healthcare facilities [(Alexa Strabuk, ICHS, 2024-10-07)](https://iexaminer.org/chinatown-id-legacy-business-city-produce-to-relocate-after-ichs-acquires-property-for-affordable-housing-project-with-lihi/).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\nKelli Nomura serves as the CEO of ICHS. She has been recognized as a Diversity Champion by the Puget Sound Business Journal for her commitment to health equity and advocacy for low-income individuals. Nomura has a long history of involvement in community health, having served on the ICHS Board of Directors for over a decade before becoming CEO in 2022 [(Kelli Nomura, N.A.P, 2024-12-16)](https://napost.com/2024/news1-12132024/).\n\nDr. Deepa Lakshimi Yerram is the Chief Medical Officer at ICHS. She has emphasized the organization's dedication to serving the community with high standards of care, particularly in light of their recent recognition for Medicaid Cost and Quality [(ICHS, 2024-12-09)](https://www.king5.com/article/news/community/facing-race/violent-crime-cid-deterring-patients-seeking-medical-care/281-516aaf68-830b-47d4-a865-bf6490aa89a1).\n\n# News\n\n## Recent Achievements and Recognition\n\nICHS was ranked as Washington State’s No. 1 community health center in Medicaid Cost and Quality by the Washington Health Alliance in their 2024 Community Checkup report. This recognition underscores ICHS's commitment to delivering high-quality care at a responsible cost [(ICHS, 2024-12-09)](https://www.king5.com/article/news/community/facing-race/violent-crime-cid-deterring-patients-seeking-medical-care/281-516aaf68-830b-47d4-a865-bf6490aa89a1).\n\n## Community Impact and Initiatives\n\nICHS has been proactive in addressing healthcare disparities, particularly among immigrant populations. The organization has implemented health education campaigns tailored to the linguistic and cultural needs of its patients [(ICHS, 2024-12-09)](https://www.king5.com/article/news/community/facing-race/violent-crime-cid-deterring-patients-seeking-medical-care/281-516aaf68-830b-47d4-a865-bf6490aa89a1). Additionally, ICHS is involved in community development projects, such as the acquisition of property for a mixed-use development that will include affordable housing and healthcare facilities [(Alexa Strabuk, ICHS, 2024-10-07)](https://iexaminer.org/chinatown-id-legacy-business-city-produce-to-relocate-after-ichs-acquires-property-for-affordable-housing-project-with-lihi/).\n\n## Challenges and Community Concerns\n\nICHS faces challenges related to safety concerns in the Chinatown-International District (CID), where some patients have expressed hesitance to visit due to recent violent incidents. CEO Kelli Nomura has acknowledged these concerns and emphasized the importance of ensuring a safe environment for patients seeking care [(Sharon Yoo, KING 5, 2024-12-09)](https://www.king5.com/article/news/community/facing-race/violent-crime-cid-deterring-patients-seeking-medical-care/281-516aaf68-830b-47d4-a865-bf6490aa89a1).\n\n## Future Developments\n\nICHS plans to continue expanding its services and facilities, including the upcoming Ron Chew Healthy Aging and Wellness Center, which is set to open in 2025. This center will significantly increase the capacity to serve vulnerable older adults [(Kelli Nomura, N.A.P, 2024-12-16)](https://napost.com/2024/news1-12132024/). The organization is also exploring the feasibility of maintaining a pharmacy at its after-hours clinic to better serve patients' needs [(ICHS, 2024-11-13)](https://iexaminer.org/what-its-like-to-run-an-after-hours-clinic-in-south-seattle/).\n\nIn conclusion, International Community Health Services is a leader in providing accessible healthcare to marginalized communities in Washington State. With a strong commitment to health equity, innovative programs, and community engagement, ICHS is well-positioned to continue making a significant impact in the healthcare landscape.",

      "# Post ID 1dlan15: About to lose my teeth and I can't afford the needed procedures to save them. Are there programs that can help here? with +273 score by [(acpom, Reddit, 2024-06-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1dlan15/about_to_lose_my_teeth_and_i_cant_afford_the/)\nSo, I have very severe gum recession all over my mouth to the point my roots are fully exposed in some areas. Some of my teeth are now loose and I'm panicking. To add to that all - it hurts.\n\nMy medical insurance can cover things if its caused by an accident and honestly I've debated intentionally falling to knock some out just for that reason. Otherwise my dental only covers $2000 a year of a $10,000 procedure that would need to happen within the next few months to save my teeth.\n\nI know Washington has medical insurance help, but are there any dental programs? This would be for a periodontist.\n\nUpdate: Thank you everybody. I've contacted UW and tried PIMA, but they were closed. I also was approved for Care Credit and have been looking into each of your recommendations for periodontists and dentists. Unfortunately I don't have the ability to travel internationally to have things done, though - I appreciate everybody's suggestions and insights about it though.\n\nYou've all been very helpful, thank you. <3\n\nUpdate: Surgery is next week! <3 <3 <3 <3 <3\n\n## Comment ID l9nm1re with +410 score by [(judithishere, Reddit, 2024-06-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1dlan15/about_to_lose_my_teeth_and_i_cant_afford_the/l9nm1re/) (in reply to ID 1dlan15):\nUW Dental School.  You will probably have to leave a message when you call, but they will call you back.  I had extensive dental work done there, 10's of thousands dollars worth, for a fraction of the cost.  Would recommend.  Only caveat is your appointments take a bit of time as the student will need to show an instructor the work during your appt so you have to schedule a block of time for each appt (think 2-3 hours)\n\n### Comment ID l9ojbys with +96 score by [(Fantastic_Elk7086, Reddit, 2024-06-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1dlan15/about_to_lose_my_teeth_and_i_cant_afford_the/l9ojbys/) (in reply to ID l9nm1re):\nThe students are awesome too, the guy I work with right now is by far the most gentle with my teeth out of any professional I’ve ever had work on my teeth.

It’s good you’re reaching out directly to periodontists, it sounds like you’ll need several gum grafts. It’s not the terrible surgery it use to be two decades ago, they’ve gotten pretty good at it these days. But if you need to have grafts on both sides of your mouth it makes eating for about a month or two very difficult, smoothies only basically. I recommend buying [Soylent](https://soylent.com/collections/meal-replacements) too, that’s stuff was a life saver. and absolutely nothing even slightly acidic, like no fruits that even have preservatives, unbelievable pain will ensue.\n\nFeel free to ask questions.\n\n### Comment ID l9shswm with +3 score by [(funchefchick, Reddit, 2024-06-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1dlan15/about_to_lose_my_teeth_and_i_cant_afford_the/l9shswm/) (in reply to ID l9p71b5):\nI wouldn’t bother with the BBB - I *would* consider reporting that dentist to the Washington State Dental Quality Assurance Commission, the licensing board for dentists in our state.

Neoliberalism puts the onus on the individual. I’ve been where you are. The only relief I found at the time was emergency extraction services at discount dental offices in the hood. I was raised to care for my teeth, had braces, had wisdom teeth removed, etc. I ended up paying $28k to have my teeth removed and implants placed and $30k for temps and permanent clip ins. My smile is beautiful but my face will never look as good as it did with natural bone structure. Yes I went to the UW clinic. Yes I applied for state insurance which does not cover extensive dental work. I had the mouth restoration done partially in Burien, WA and Palo Alto, CA.\n\n## Comment ID l9r1qj9 with +1 score by [(kobachi, Reddit, 2024-06-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1dlan15/about_to_lose_my_teeth_and_i_cant_afford_the/l9r1qj9/) (in reply to ID 1dlan15):\nWhy can’t you travel internationally?

      "# Post ID 1co3jw9: This Week in Destiny 05/09/2024 with +338 score by [(DTG_Bot, Reddit, 2024-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1co3jw9/this_week_in_destiny_05092024/)\nSource: https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/twid-05-09-2024\n\n---\n\nThis week in Destiny, we are talking a bit more about Exotic class items. We announced them along with the Prismatic subclass, and it's time we tell you more about this groundbreaking addition to Destiny 2—and that's just our first topic for the week! \n\n\n\n* More info about the new Exotic class items. \n* New boss profile for The Pantheon. \n* The red border weapons bonanza is here! \n* Zero Hour arrives next week. \n* Check out our new PvP maps trailer. \n* Enjoy Destiny 2: Expansion Open Access now through June 3! \n* The Gauntlet returns for its 10th anniversary \n* It's AANHPI Heritage Month. \n##A Matter of Exotic Class Items\n\n\nThis morning, we shared some amazing videos showcasing the Prismatic subclass coming with The Final Shape. Check them!\n\n\n####Warlock\n* [Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/embed/WY3GNEddJ-U)\n\n####Hunter\n* [Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/embed/G_zUYhy6UnE)\n\n####Titan\n* [Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/embed/h00Drr7UZ8o)\n\n\nAs you can see, you will not only have the new Aspects and Fragments coming with Prismatic, but also will get to further expand your options with the new Exotic class items. These are very special additions to Destiny 2 as each Exotic class item will have two random Exotic perks from a selection of existing Exotic armor perks, including some that belong to classes other than yours! \n\n\n###How to Earn Them \n\n\nThe Exotic Class items will be part of a new activity that unlocks after the Raid World First, at the beginning of Week 2.  We don’t want to spoil what the activity is all about or how to unlock it, but we can say it's farmable, and you will get a guaranteed random roll each time you complete it. \n\n\n###How Many Exotic Perks \n\n\nSimilar to how Prismatic has a selection of abilities among all Light and Darkness classes, the Exotic class items in The Final Shape will have a mix of Exotic armor perks available for each class. We included some fan favorites as well as some perks that aligned with the Prismatic abilities and Aspects. We also chose to put perks in each column that would compound with each other, allowing for combinations that felt powerful and complementary, such as a Warlock bond with Sprit of Apotheosis and Spirt of the Star-Eater. \n\n\n\nPrismatic is all about combining effects that used to belong to specific subclasses, and we wanted to bring that to the design of the Exotic class items, too. So, in many cases, we have adjusted the perks to work with a broader array of abilities. For example, Spirit of Caliban on the Hunter cloak works with all powered melees, not just Proximity Knife. \n\n\n\nTo keep things balanced, we have narrowed some of the perk effects to what we believe the spirit of (get it?) the original Exotic was. This allows the combination of two of them to not be overwhelming, and it maintains a reason to run the original Exotic armor. When a perk on the class item has the same effect as its original version you should expect some tuning changes. For example, in The Final Shape the original Armamentarium and Sixth Coyote will gain the ability to create Orbs of Light from your grenade and dodge respectively. \n\n\n   \n\nCheck out all the possible combos below! \n   \n\n\n###Hunter Exotic Cloak - Essentialism\n\nFirst Column|Second Column  \n|-|-|  \n|**SPIRIT OF THE ASSASSIN:** Finishers and powered melee final blows grant invisibility.|**SPIRIT OF THE STAR-EATER:** While your Super energy is full, picking up an Orb of Power overcharges your Super, granting it bonus damage.|\n|**SPIRIT OF THE INMOST LIGHT:** Using an ability empowers the other two abilities granting them improved energy regeneration. |**SPIRIT OF THE SYNTHOCEPS:** Improved melee damage when you're surrounded. |\n|**SPIRIT OF THE OPHIDIAN:** Weapons ready very quickly. |**SPIRIT OF VERITY:** Weapon final blows with a damage type matching your grenade grant a stacking grenade damage bonus. |\n|**SPIRIT OF THE DRAGON:** Using your class ability reloads all weapons and increases weapon handling speeds for a brief time. |**SPIRIT OF THE CYRTARACHNE:** Gain Woven Mail when you use your grenade. |\n|**SPIRIT OF GALANOR:** Hits and final blows with your Super will return Super energy after it ends. |**SPIRIT OF THE GYRFALCON:** Your Void weapons gain Volatile Rounds after you emerge from being invisible. |\n|**SPIRIT OF THE FOETRACER:** Damaging a powerful combatant or Guardian with an ability grants you a temporary damage bonus for weapons matching that ability's element. |**SPIRIT OF THE LIAR:** Dealing damage with a powered melee or being hit by a melee attack will allow you to follow up with an extremely powerful melee counterpunch. |\n|**SPIRIT OF CALIBAN:** Powered melee final blows trigger an ignition. |**SPIRIT OF THE WORMHUSK:** Dodging gives a small health and shield bump. |\n|**SPIRIT OF RENEWAL:** Allies inside the Duskfield take reduced damage, and targets inside the area deal reduced damage. |**SPIRIT OF THE COYOTE:** Gain an additional class ability charge. |\n\n   \n\n### Titan Exotic Mark - Stoicism\n\n|**First column**|**Second column**|\n|--|--|\n**SPIRIT OF THE ASSASSIN:** Finishers and powered melee final blows grant invisibility. |**SPIRIT OF THE STAR-EATER:** While your Super energy is full, picking up an Orb of Power overcharges your Super, granting it bonus damage. |\n**SPIRIT OF INMOST LIGHT:** Using an ability empowers the other two abilities, granting them improved energy regeneration |**SPIRIT OF SYNTHOCEPS:** Improved melee damage when you're surrounded. |\n**SPIRIT OF THE OPHIDIAN:** Weapons ready very quickly. |**SPIRIT OF VERITY:** Weapon final blows with a damage type matching your grenade grant a stacking grenade damage bonus. |\n**SPIRIT OF SEVERANCE:** Powered melee or finisher final blows unleash a damaging explosion. |**SPIRIT OF CONTACT:** Damaging a target with a powered melee causes all nearby enemies to suffer lightning strikes and become jolted. |\n**SPIRIT OF HOARFROST:** Your Barricade becomes a wall of Stasis crystals that slows nearby targets when created. |**SPIRIT OF SCARS:** Final blows with weapons that have a damage type matching your Super's element create a burst of healing around you that grants allies restoration. |\n**SPIRIT OF THE ETERNAL WARRIOR:** Gain a damage bonus for weapons matching your Super's element when your Super ends. |**SPIRIT OF THE HORN:** Your Barricade unleashes a blast of Solar energy that scorches targets |\n**SPIRIT OF THE ABEYANT:** Improves Drengr’s Lash.

However, we are also making a set of Exotic armor balance adjustments with the launch of The Final Shape, including some buffs that will impact both the original armor and its Spirit version. So, some of the class item perk combinations might end up being better than you expect. We’ll have more to share about Exotic armor balance in general in the coming weeks.\n\n\n\nWe hope the amazing combinations that the new Exotic class items will allow when using Prismatic have ignited your imagination and you are already wondering what builds will work best when The Final Shape arrives. Let us know, and please share your early build ideas with us.\n\n\n##Another God to Best in The Pantheon \n\n\nGuardians, you have shown the world again that, no matter who you face—be it one god or several—you will always prevail. Another of our greatest enemies entered The Pantheon this Tuesday, we hope this report helps with your task. \n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n**VANGUARD – GUARDIAN DISPATCH – ALL POINTS BULLETIN**\n\n\n\nDEFENDERS OF THE CITY, \n\n\n\nYou are tasked with the elimination of the following target: \n\n\n\n**- ORYX, THE TAKEN KING -** \n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blt5733363b5909b32b/663c7602aea329218360eb4a/2022_KingsFall_Raid_Press_Kit_Oryx_Compressed_003.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/OopeT7u.jpeg)\n\n**CLASSIFICATION** \n\n\n\n* Hive God \n* First Navigator and King of the Osmium Court \n* Brother to Savathûn and Xivu Arath \n* Father to Crota \n* Ex-Krill \n* Taken, Wielder \n\n**HAZARDS** \n\n\n\n* The power to Take \n* Willbreaker, Blade of Oryx \n* Commands Hive and Taken legions \n* Planar tearing \n* Corrupted Light \n* Darkness mastery \n* Godly strength and durability \n* Guardians rated Sigma-3 or lower are advised not to engage \n\n**INTEL** \n\n\n\n* Oryx was once known as Aurash, one of the three sisters of Krill nobility. She became Oryx upon descending into the Deep, accepting a worm, and choosing to shed her form in favor of the king morph. Oryx then began a crusade of conquest and death across the universe in pursuit of the Final Shape. \n* After invading Sol to seek vengeance for the death of his son, Crota, and winning a decisive victory at the battle of Saturn, Oryx was dethroned by a valiant fireteam who infiltrated the Dreadnaught and ended the Taken King. \n* Many Hive still tithe to Oryx in secret, though it is not known where the power of their tithes goes, given that the Taken King is dead. \n* After his defeat, Oryx’s corpse fell to Titan where the Lucent Hive attempted to resurrect him through the heretical use of necromancy, a crime for which Oryx once banished another of his sons, Nokris. This scheme was foiled by Guardian operatives. \n\n**OF NOTE** \n\n\n\n* Oryx slew Akka, the Worm of Secrets, and carved the Dreadnaught from its corpse. Hidden operatives report faint biosignatures still pulsing from within the ship’s hull. \n* Through the use of Willbreaker and the Dreadnaught, Oryx may weaponize his throne world, allowing it to spill into the material plane as a wave of destructive power. This weapon claimed the Awoken Fleet during the Battle of Saturn. \n* While imprisoned in the Dreaming City, Savathûn once claimed that her brother Oryx was unable to control his curiosity, that his worm intentionally directs it, and that the worm manipulates Oryx’s actions unbeknownst to him. She claims all Hive worms function in this way. The veracity of this claim is unconfirmed. \n* Eris Morn used Oryx’s Ravenous Heart to construct the Exotic weapon Touch of Malice. \n\n***\n\n\n##All the Deepsight Weapons You Can Get! \n\n\n[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blteee2e3972fc22e34/663c74ba1357525e2229d499/FrontPageBanner_PC_1920x590_TWIDRedBorder_050924.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/3ZQ1v7r.jpeg)\n\nWelcome, everyone, to the red border weapons bonanza! In a similar fashion to what we did last year, players who have not earned enough Deepsight weapons to unlock the Patterns of Year-6 Seasonal weapons now have the chance to catch up before The Final Shape launches. \n\n\n\nEvery day, from May 7 through June 3, players will get a guaranteed Deepsight weapon drop upon completion of a Seasonal activity. So, if you still have not unlocked the Pattern for, let's say, the Raconteur Bow from Season of Defiance, you can complete a Defiant Battleground to receive a Deepsight drop of that very weapon. You will get another the day after and another the day after that one, and so on until you have completed the Pattern. Don't worry much if you have more than one. If you keep playing, our knockout system will ensure you'll only get drops for those weapons. \n\n\n\nSo, what activities can you play from each Season to get these awesome rewards? \n\n\n\n* Season of Defiance \n\n\n\n   * Defiant Battlegrounds \n\n\n   * Mission AVALON \n\n\n* Season of the Deep \n\n\n\n   * Deep Dives \n\n\n   * Salvage \n\n\n* Season of the Witch \n\n\n\n   * Summoning Pools \n\n\n   * Savathûn's Spire \n\n\n* Season of the Wish \n\n\n\n   * Riven's Lair \n\n\n   * The Coil \n\n\n\nWe hope you have a great time revisiting some of the amazing activities that have defined this year of Destiny 2, all while you complete your weapons collection. \n\n\n##Zero Hour Is Near \n\n\n[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blt65e64c7a9b1f9c3e/663c76a4e5f2142a32ee2205/2024_Into_the_Light_Press_Kit_Zero_Hour_COMPRESSED_000.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/KhInoSH.jpeg)\n\nFirst came The Whisper, then it was Zero Hour. The second-ever Destiny 2 secret Exotic mission is coming back on May 14. You'll be able to find it in the Into the Light node in the Director, and it has a few surprises up its sleeve. \n\n\n\nThose capable enough to complete it before their time runs out (40 minutes on Normal and 20 minutes on Legend), will get the new craftable version of the Outbreak Perfected Exotic Pulse Rifle. Find some of the secret chests available each week to also unlock new additional perks for it. If you are looking for its Exotic catalyst, you'll have to complete Zero Hour on Legend difficulty, but remember that if you got the catalyst for the original version, you won't have to earn it again. That said, you will still want to do it to get the weekly Triumphs required to unlock the new Exotic ship. \n\n\n###And TR3-VR Is Near, Too... \n\n\nRemember TR3-VR, the overly attached&nbsp;robot that kept the Cryptarchy's vaults safe in Zero Hour? It was impossible to miss! So much joy, so many wonderful memories... Well, great news, everyone! He'll be back, too. \n\n\n\nTo celebrate his timely return, we would love it if you all shared your best moments with him: well-scripted videos, funny screenshots, fanart, comics, musical numbers... it's all on the table. And if this is your first time meeting him,  we can't wait to see your experiences. \n\n\n\nJust don't forget to use the **#MyFriendTR3VR** hashtag when sharing it on social media so we can see your creations and maybe pick a few to share in the future. Our favorite submissions could get the AOTW or MOTW emblems (don't forget to include your BungieID with your creation). \n\n\n##Three New PvP Maps in One Trailer \n\n\n[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blt13b378ceb7ecb595/66290d4fe7ce956b3cdea704/Crucible_FrontPageBanner_1920x590_1.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/AEfog54.jpeg)\n\nShaxx has been busy lately.

Everyone who participates in the playlist before The Final Shape goes live gets [an incredible Crucible-themed emblem!](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/twid-05-02-2024) \n\n\n##A Great Time to Jump Into Destiny 2\n\n\nIn anticipation of our battle with the Witness, we want everyone to be ready. And we really mean it. Starting May 7 and running through June 3, we have launched Destiny 2: Expansion Open Access period. \n\n[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/embed/yb80CvCeBjE)\n\nDuring those 28 days, the following contents will be **available to all players**: \n\n\n\n**Expansions** \n\n\n\n* Destiny 2: Shadowkeep \n* Destiny 2: Beyond Light \n* Destiny 2: The Witch Queen \n\n**Year-6 Seasons** \n\n\n\n* Destiny 2: Season of Defiance \n* Destiny 2: Season of the Deep \n* Destiny 2: Season of the Witch \n* Destiny 2: Season of the Wish \n\nPlayStation Plus members can also claim the Destiny 2: Lightfall, which will be available up until June 3.

When The Final Shape launches on June 4, the campaigns for Shadowkeep and Beyond Light along with the Stasis subclass will remain available to all players at no additional cost. \n\n\n\nIf you are looking to get everything else that the Shadowkeep and Beyond Light expansions have to offer beyond the campaigns, we will have two packs at your disposal, similar to the Forsaken Pack. \n\n\n\nThe Shadowkeep Pack grants access to: \n\n\n\n* 13 Exotic weapons \n* 3 Exotic armor pieces \n* The Scarlet Keep Nightfall \n* The Pit of Heresy dungeon \n* The Garden of Salvation raid \n\nThe Beyond Light Pack grants access to: \n\n\n\n* 12 Exotic weapons \n* 6 Exotic armor pieces \n* The Glassway and Proving Grounds Nightfalls \n* The Deep Stone Crypt raid \n\nOnce The Final Shape is live, we'll also launch a new pack called the Destiny 2: Legacy Collection 2024.

Your donations will fund free and low-cost health services for uninsured or underinsured ICHS patients who would otherwise be unable to afford them. \n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blt6261442718854d05/663c791c8447cb7dc99cc386/d1_210_emblem_social.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/UIbQJ7c.jpeg)\n\n[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blteaf70d466dc3f5b8/663c791d5f2485743bd0de15/Stand_With_Asians_1920x1080.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/FLqipKS.jpeg)\n###More about Asians@Bungie \n\n\nAsians@Bungie was founded at the end of 2021 in response to rising discrimination and violence against AANHPI communities. Their mission is to uplift their fellow AANHPI employees, to provide Bungie diverse insight int AANHPI cultures, and to support local AANHPI communities. \n\n\n###More about ICHS: \n\n\nICHS was formed in 1973 by young Asian American activists with the goal of disrupting systemic racism that denied healthcare to Asian immigrant communities. Today, ICHS remains deeply rooted in the Asian Pacific Islander community and continues to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate health services in more than 70 languages. This has significantly improved the wellness of King County’s diverse people and communities, regardless of patients’ ability to pay. \n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/bltef9c3ce997a3769a/663c79602a72d92387179a06/ICHS-Bungie-Blog-Photo-2023.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/I4YrNMK.jpeg)\n\nWe invite all allies to support the AANHPI communities by purchasing the Stand With Asians pin, which also comes with the Harmonic Waves emblem.

Players will be directed to speak to Shaxx during the last week of Into the Light. \n\n\n###Risky Archery Emote \n\n\nDue to an issue, the Risky Archery emote has been temporarily changed to use a different animation. Once the issue is fixed in a future update, the Risky Archery emote will return to its normal animation. \n\n\n###Player Privacy and Safety Update \n\n\nAs mentioned in our recent March 14 TWID, we are continuing with our efforts to ensure player privacy and safety online in Destiny 2. Our goal is to provide age-appropriate experiences to all our players and give the adults responsible for our younger players a way to tailor those players' experiences. If you haven’t already, please visit Bungie.net or use the prompt after launching Destiny 2 to update your date of birth. \n\n\n####Parental Controls \n\n\nIn May, parents, guardians, and other responsible adults will be able to adjust their child’s Destiny 2 settings.\n\n\n\nTo set up parental controls, both the child and their adult will need a Bungie.net account, and we will need to verify that the person providing consent and setting controls is an adult. We have created a [Parental Controls Help article](https://help.bungie.net/articles/24217906958868) with details explaining how to create an account and link it up to their child's.\n\n\n\nWe are also updating our [privacy policy](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Legal/privacypolicy) on May 14.

Current Osmiomancy is 10/22/34/50% depending on the tier of enemy with no cooldown while Contraverse is  2000% base ability regen for 1.75 seconds with a 4 second cooldown which ends up being somewhere around 12.5% per trigger with no kills.

At a bear minimum ALL of shadowkeep should be in there, that thing is so damn old at this point just make it default. And can we stop with multiple packs. If you MUST keep some stuff sectioned off, please just crunch it down to Latest Expansion and Legacy which has everything.

He is new to Seattle and doesn't have a job nor health insurance. He has been experiencing severe stomach pain on and off for the last few months. The pain is severe enough to incapacitate him for an hour or two, until it subsidies. I believe he has an ulcer. I had one when I was younger and, if I remember correctly, his symptoms are very similar to what I had.  He doesn't feel like he can afford to go to a doctor for exam, tests, and medicine.  I can't bear to see my friend in such pain every few days or week. I want to help him with the costs of seeing a doctor.\n\nI'm not wealthy so, I would like to find some place that isn't going to end up costing me a fortune. Does anyone have any suggestions for an affordable place  where I can take my friend to get a medical examination and possibly, tests to diagnose what is causing this gastric pain? I have no experience with Urgent Care centers, public health clinics, etc. What do people in this country do when they don't have health insurance and the situation is not an emergency?\n\n## Comment ID k651iis with +55 score by [(jcsuperfly, Reddit, 2023-10-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/17equnm/recommendations_for_where_to_go_for_medical_exam/k651iis/) (in reply to ID 17equnm):\nUW Medicine offers financial aid up to 100% for those that are up to 300% of federal poverty level ($43,740 for a single person).

I also go to a top program, top 15 in the country. 600 hours of clinical time is just not enough in my opinion..  i am definitely going to apply for fellowships just like i did for a RN residency. Although the pay is a little less in a NP fellowship (roughly 85k salary in PNW), i think the learning will be invaluable. How did you go about finding fellowships? Did you move out of state for any? Also when you state nurses who did not have many yrs of RN experience, what were disadvantages with that for their first NP job? I ask as i am one of those FNP students with RN experience, but not “many years” of it.\n\n#### Comment ID fssnv9w with +1 score by [(tera_byte, Reddit, 2020-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nursepractitioner/comments/gvyz93/fellowshipsresidencies_for_nps/fssnv9w/) (in reply to ID fsskave):\nAre you living in the PNW?

We were based in primary care so spent 2 to 3 days working in a primary care/walk in clinic working independently and building our panels. The other days we rotated through specialties. Working with endocrinologist, orthopedist, cardiologist, podiatrist, women's health, pediatric, etc. The chance to rotate and work with board certified specialist was truly amazing. I feel much more confident as a primary care nurse practitioner managing certain illnesses. Not to mention the cultural experience working with all the different cultures in Hawaii. \nSalary was about 2/3 what a full-time NP makes but also my expectations were less and it was a learning environment. It was much more than a medical resident makes which is about 55K.\nIn the future I think residency should be mandatory for nurse practitioners. We always rely heavily on our past experiences as nurses however those experiences aren't standardized. 30 years as an l&d nurse is not the same as 30 years working in the emergency department or orthopedics. Unless we standardize our experiences (i.e. 2 years in the ED, 2 years in ICU, 2 years in family practice, etc) we shouldn't use that as a justification for our practice.\nLMK if you want information on the residencies. We were part of a broader nationwide residency that is accreditated and does a really good job.\n\n### Comment ID fsssf3p with +2 score by [(scottietohottie619, Reddit, 2020-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nursepractitioner/comments/gvyz93/fellowshipsresidencies_for_nps/fsssf3p/) (in reply to ID fsso52h):\nHi!

While I didn't get to do one myself, the learning curve was steep even though it was primary care. I can only imagine how much more on-the-job training you'd need in an inpatient/specialty service.\n\nI was lucky that I did have a doctor that was my go-to and willing to jump in for all my acutely ill/more complex patients but there is always going to be times where they are busy seeing patients, they are mentally worn down or tired from their day, or you personally might start feeling like you're asking too many questions. God forbid they are out on vacation and one of the other docs (who might not see themselves necessarily as your \"go to\") might be more hands off, then you might feel sort of stuck. Not to say that you SHOULDN'T continue to ask questions, but for myself, it felt disheartened whenever I had a \"I should know this by now\" moment. And let's say you're first job doesn't have a physician open to hand-hold? You might find yourself treading water daily and that's just not a good feeling to be doing solo.\n\nI'd imagine that a residency program also pushes you in the right direction, and guarantees certain type of feedback that is conducive to learning and improving. Sometimes I found that my supervising MDs might jump in and take over a decompensating patient or tell me what to do for a patient, but never give me feedback or explain what else I could/should have done differently, so I'd never understand their logic behind the treatment plan. Certain MDs have different styles- some are more thorough than others, and some tend to be more conservative, etc.\n\nSorry for just rambling. All in all, I really wish I could have done a residency program when I first graduated. Part of me wishes I still could (if I were to go into a different field- like acute care!)\n\n## Comment ID fsvspvc with +2 score by [(beerclaws, Reddit, 2020-06-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nursepractitioner/comments/gvyz93/fellowshipsresidencies_for_nps/fsvspvc/) (in reply to ID gvyz93):\nI am in/completed my quasi-fellowship/residency in WA state. I would whole heartedly agree that some residency/fellowship will help improve your practice and I would also suggest that any new provider do one if possible.\n\nMy background was ER and PICU, almost 3 years each. I got a job as an ARNP doing Pediatric ER, pediatric urgent care with some adult UC. It’s not necessarily advertised as a fellowship/residency but I got 6 months of ER (basically working as a resident) with 2 months of UC supervised. Monthly didactic sessions tailored to my weaknesses and with some rotations with ortho, radiology, etc. They also had a great set of orientation videos for UC. \n\nSo happy I did it.

For this reason, I think they will be called more \"Post-graduate training\" - But I digress - Any training is going to be better than none, regardless of what it is or what it is called.\n\nWith that being said, I get the vibe these training programs for PAs/NPs are more for the business than they are for the specific provider. What I mean by that is, a lot of these places are intending that you will ultimately end up working for said organization after training. I get this vibe because these organizations are paying out of pocket to train you. They get nothing out of this other than a better trained provider. This is different than residency in that these companies are provided compensation by a third party to receive basically indentured servants as employees. \n\nSo, pros: You are more competent, you understand the company culture better, you build a relationship with the APPs and Physicians in said organization, you are a trusted team member\n\nCons: You don't need to do this, so you are taking an insane pay-cut for an entire year for something optional. Also, perhaps you are motivated to stay with said organization. Now I don't know if this is true, like I said, this is just the vibe I get from looking at these programs and the people who have gone on to do these programs that I've seen (They all end up staying with said organization where they did their training). \n\nOverall I'd say the pros outweigh the cons, but to each their own. If money is no concern, I would say do the training because you're never going to get to learn from your mistakes in such a capacity again.\n\n## Comment ID fstkqy4 with +1 score by [(Koala_8, Reddit, 2020-06-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nursepractitioner/comments/gvyz93/fellowshipsresidencies_for_nps/fstkqy4/) (in reply to ID gvyz93):\nI wish NP residency was something available in my area (Southwestern rural Wisconsin).

I'm still in school but I have 3 friends who have gone through a residency before practice and 2 who didn't. The ones who did absolutely loved it. Though in Seattle, the pay for one was like 70% salary of what I'd expect for a full time PNP.

But for those who have zero RN experience or mentors, or are nervous about own abilities, residency could alleviate some anxiety.\n\nI look at it this way: because residencies are extremely few, most new NPs never had one; however, most of them do fine. I have worked with many Direct-Entry PMHNPs who never did a residency. They find employers and mentors who are willing to train them...some will even let them shadow for a while and then start with a reduced patient load (in reality it's not so different from a residency). After 6 months, these NPs are usually off and running.\n\nThe biggest cons for residency are the low pay and the fact that not all residencies are good (some don't provide much supervision anyway so it's 'residency' in name only). The residency I looked at pays $40k to $60k less than a regular job."

As within many large healthcare centers - there's a smorgasbord of different care providers with different egos, styles, and biases. If interpreters call out sick or the video interpreter machine doesn't work, your work gets a lot harder. Seems to try to stretch everyone. Supervisors are also overloaded, lots of geriatric patients here from the nursing home that is located near the clinic. Lot of complicated patients with cultural and language barriers here. \r\n\r\nBased on reviewing medical records of patients, the provider that I replaced was here for about 1 year before he left. I saw about 2-3 other names of people who used to work there. However, there are some people who have been around for a LONG time. As with many work environments, there's some politics as play, lots of ego.\r\n\r\nIt was hard because as I was getting credentialed, I had to have someone else sign off on my charts who was credentialed. The feedback was helpful at times, but it was just too much. Some of the providers disagreed with each other on the feedback. It just my life that much harder on top of everything else. \r\n\r\nI think a coworker I used to know has also left that place within the last few months. Midlevels seem to have an uphill battle here. They typically need locums for coverage. You have to get credentialed for everything and getting credentialed takes forever.",

Or they have been re-orged out of the organization because of the many changes in the management structure.  I have never seen a management team turnover this high in any organization I have worked in.  Original ideas are not accepted and there is no possibility of meaningful discussions or raising legitimate concerns.  Top management cuts people off in mid-sentence and is very disrespectful so therefore, there is a general feeling of dislike and disrespect throughout the organization.

Stop sending out stupid annual promises of a pay increase and it is only a few cents! What a slap in the face. You guys can have that since it looks like you're hurting so much you can't even pay your employees a livable wage! Despicable! PAY US MORE!!!!!

Management team meetings are dreaded, where top leadership openly puts managers down and prevents any constructive dialogue from taking place.  People literally get cut off as they're talking if they raise concerns or exhibit critical thinking.  There is a lack of conflict management or interpersonal skills amongst top leaders here.

Or they have been re-orged out of the organization because of the many changes in the management structure.  I have never seen a management team turnover this high in any organization I have worked in.  Original ideas are not accepted and there is no possibility of meaningful discussions or raising legitimate concerns.  Top management cuts people off in mid-sentence and is very disrespectful so therefore, there is a general feeling of dislike and disrespect throughout the organization.

This means unbiased assessment whether the current position is truly adding value to the organization, to the department and eliminating redundancy.  So far, promotions have been approved and those looking from the outside in are questioning \"how did that happen when he/she appears to be doing the same level of responsibilities as before (qualitative versus just quantitative)\" while those who truly should be promoted aren't because those additional duties are \"duties as assigned\".",

      "# [ICHS ranked Washington State’s No. 1 community health center by efelle creative](https://www.ichs.com/news/ichs-ranked-washington-states-no-1-community-health-center)\nInternational Community Health Services (ICHS) was ranked the top performing federally-qualified community health center in all of Washington state in Medicaid Cost and Quality by the Washington Health Alliance. The ranking in the Where You Live Matters: Community Checkup 2024 report is based upon quality and cost measures compared across the state’s best performing health care providers.\n\n“Earning recognition in the Washington Health Alliance report isn't just an honor,” said Dr. Deepa Lakshimi Yerram, ICHS Chief Medical Officer. “It's a validation of our dedication to serving our community with the highest standards of care. Think of the Washington Health Alliance as a scorecard for healthcare in Washington. Their Common Measure Set, based on real data, identifies providers who excel in delivering quality care at a responsible cost. We're proud to be recognized among the top performers, demonstrating our commitment to providing accessible, efficient healthcare for everyone.”\n\nThe Community Checkup is an annual report highlighting health care quality and value at medical groups and hospitals in Washington state. The data gives providers and patients a big picture look at healthcare throughout the state in an overall effort to transform the health care system for the better. Data points were charted from 36 data sources that illustrate the lived experiences of more than 4 million people across Washington state receiving care at 1,875 clinics, 325 medical groups, 100 hospitals and 16 health plans. Washingtonians with Medicaid and private insurance, living in both urban and rural areas were all included.\n\nWashington state is home to 27 federally qualified community health centers (FQHC) that deliver health care to more than 1.1 million Washingtonians each year at more than 350 clinic sites. These non-profit health care providers provide high-quality, cost-effective health services to everyone who walks through their doors.\n\nIn 2022, ICHS provided health services to 30,612 patients who spoke more than 70 languages. 47% of ICHS patients were on Medicaid insurance plans — almost double the rate Washington state share of population covered by Medicaid according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\n“ICHS received the lowest in our Medicaid cost utilization,” said Wendy Kim, ICHS Quality and Accreditation Manager. “That meant that we really took care of our patients. They weren't going to hospitals for their care. They weren't overspending on costly, unnecessary medical treatments. [Their health needs] were all taken care of here at ICHS.”\n\n“Addressing Care Gaps”\n\nICHS was compared to other Washington health care organizations in the Where You Live Matters: Community Checkup 2024 report based upon patient care measures. These include rates of well child checkups, the number of patients who take their required medications, and the screenings for health conditions such as breast cancer and diabetes.\n\nICHS as a primary care community health center has long prioritized preventive screenings as part of ICHS’ health and wellness services, said Jin Yi Zhou, ICHS Quality Improvement Administrator. Not getting screenings could result in more severe disease that require costlier treatments, visits to emergency rooms or hospitals.\n\nOne major achievement that stood out in the report is ICHS surpassing the 90th Percentile National benchmark for care providers for patients completing on-time colon cancer screening.\n\nAccording to health researchers, colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the world, and yet screenings remain “underused,” These scores, Zhou said, set “the bar” for excellence in performance nationwide.\n\nICHS’ quality improvement team actively evaluates the quality of preventive care provided within each of the medical clinics at ICHS. The top ranking is largely because of the patient-provider trust that ICHS has built over the last 50 years serving diverse communities. From providers in the clinic, to teams of population health staff that call and speak with patients to walk them through preventative care and screenings.\n\nZhou knows this directly — he and his family were patients at ICHS before he joined as an employee.\n\n“Speaking from my own family’s experience, they would receive calls from someone speaking their language telling them about medical screenings and appointments,” said Zhou. “That is already a huge plus. Someone would [explain] their care to them. Communication is very, very efficient at ICHS and patients, they enjoy the experience.”\n\nHealth research has found that U.S. immigrants have lower health screening rates than native-born Americans. Having regular screening tests — medical tests to check for diseases early and when they may be easier to treat — are essential to living a longer healthier life, according to the CDC. However, immigrants face cultural, language, and financial barriers to receive life-saving screenings.\n\nThat’s why ICHS’ Quality Improvement and Population Health teams are so important, said Kim.\n\nWhen asked how ICHS achieved such high screening numbers, Kim shared that it’s largely due to the efforts of ICHS’ population health team who launch robust health education campaigns that are linguistically and culturally competent for ICHS’ patients.\n\nFrom in-language postcards, text and phone outreach to patients in the languages they speak, and comprehensive data tracking to follow-up on ICHS patients most at risk, said Kim.\n\nAt the end of the day, it’s really a team effort from across the non-profit organization that makes ICHS an integrated care home for patients.\n\n“Congratulations to the QI, Population Health, Clinical, Providers, RNs, MAs, PSRs, Data Team, Eligibility, Care Managers, and Care Coordinators, for their collective efforts in making ICHS the lowest Medicaid cost center in the state of Washington for healthcare,” said Kim. “Together we are improving healthcare accessibility and affordability for all of our patients.”",

And have led to expanding access to life-saving pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) medications to help 80 ICHS patients regularly receive and stay on this medication — nearly double the number of patients then in 2022.\n\nDue to a range of social, economic, and demographic factors, new infections are highly concentrated among certain groups. ICHS’ Health Education Team has closed critical care gaps in HIV screenings through targeted patient outreach and education programs and staff training.\n\nJoin in the Celebration\n\nRecipients and nominees will be honored at NUHSA's 2024 Human Services Awards celebration on Wednesday, January 22nd from 5:00 to 7:00 p.m. at Kenmore City Hall, 18120 68th Ave NE, Kenmore, WA 98028.\n\nTo join this community celebration, please RSVP by emailing staff@nuhsa.org\n\nNUHSA members are human service providers, local government, faith communities, educators and concerned citizens of North King County.

      "# [Kelli Nomura, ICHS CEO Named Diversity Champion by N.A.P Contributor on 2024-12-16](https://napost.com/2024/news1-12132024/)\nBy International Community and Health Services\n\nNAP Contributor\n\nKelli Nomura, ICHS CEO, was named Diversity Champion.\n\nInternational Community Health Services (ICHS) Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Kelli Nomura, has been named Diversity Champion and selected as one of 15 preeminent health care leaders of the Puget Sound region in Washington State by the Puget Sound Business Journal (PSBJ). “Kelli Nomura has proven to be committed to working to achieve health equity,” said Alice Braverman, ICHS Foundation Executive Director. “She is well known for her advocacy to remove barriers to care. Nomura works to create a continuum of quality health services that advocates for health access for low-income people.”\n\nThe PSBJ launched the annual Health Care Leadership Awards in 2019. The program recognizes doctors, researchers, administrators and executives whose work provides models on how care can be delivered, and tools for the prevention and alleviation of illness. The awards recognize innovative and influential thinkers whose leadership has an indelible impact on the region.\n\nNomura has been a health care and community leader in the Puget Sound area for over 30 years. Prior to her appointment as ICHS’ CEO in 2022, she served on the ICHS Board of Directors for over 10 years with an emphasis on strategic planning and community relations. Nomura wanted to gain awareness of other areas of the medical health system for Seattle communities particularly the AAPI (Asian American Pacific Islander) community. “I have been connected to or interested in the integration of behavioral health with medical care because I believe that it is so important to treat the whole person and not separate treatment of the head from the body,” Nomura said. “[ICHS is] committed to providing those services in a culturally and linguistically appropriate way. We serve everyone, that is really where our mission is. [We make] sure that the community, AAPI community as well as immigrants and refugees who do not have access to health care [or] have a place to go.”\n\nICHS is a federally qualified community health center that has been at the forefront of advancing health equity for low-income, uninsured, and immigrants and refugees in King County regardless of language or financial barriers. In 2023, ICHS served 31,230 patients. Four out of five of them were low-income and seven out of nine were people of color. ICHS welcomes all people regardless of language, immigration status or financial barriers.\n\nEarlier this year, ICHS was awarded the Health Center Quality Leader Gold Badge from the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) for its clinical quality performance and ability to improve health outcomes.\n\n“Under Nomura’s leadership, ICHS has been able to adapt to the pandemic and post-pandemic needs of the communities we serve,” said Braverman. Nomura has also overseen the continuing development and planning of the new Ron Chew Healthy Aging and Wellness Center, which offers a 25,000-square-foot space to provide services to the community. It plans to open in Seattle in 2025. When completed, the center will quadruple the number of vulnerable older adults served at ICHS.\n\nPrior to joining ICHS as CEO, Nomura served as division director for the Behavioral Health and Recovery Division of King County’s Department of Community and Human Services in Seattle. She was dedicated to ensuring access to high-quality behavioral health services for low-income people of all ages in King County. Nomura was responsible for mental health and substance use disorder prevention, intervention and treatment services with a focus on recovery, as well as the management of the Mental Illness and Drug Dependency Behavioral Health sales tax revenues. Under her leadership, King County assumed the role of managing and coordinating the King County Integrated Care Network of Providers, enhancing consumer choice for behavioral health services county-wide. She also took on direct responsibility for serving as the Administrative Service Organization for the region coordinating the county’s crisis response services and access to care.\n\nPrior to joining King County in 2016, Nomura worked over 30 years in clinical and leadership roles within the behavioral health provider network. She also holds a master’s degree in Business Administration and a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology, both from the University of Washington. This is where she connected with the King County behavioral health organization and where she would eventually work after graduating.\n\nNomura grew up outside of Portland, Oregon. Her father was a physician, so she learned early on the importance of health care and preventative health, as well as the importance of access to health care. From a young age, she knew she wanted to work in the field of health.",
      "# [Violent crime in CID deterring patients from seeking medical care by Sharon Yoo on 2024-12-09](https://www.king5.com/article/news/community/facing-race/violent-crime-cid-deterring-patients-seeking-medical-care/281-516aaf68-830b-47d4-a865-bf6490aa89a1)\nSEATTLE — Violence continues to grip Seattle's Chinatown-International District.\n\nFive people were shot outside of a hookah lounge in the 800 block of South Lane Street early Saturday morning. In early November, a man was charged in connection to stabbing at least four people at the intersection of 12th and Jackson in Little Saigon.\n\nAll of this news hasn't been so encouraging for Dominic Lee, who is a CID regular.\n\n\"I should say maybe twice a week?\" Lee said when asked how often he finds himself down at CID. \"A lot of times I come down here for the restaurants for the food.\"\n\nLee also comes to the CID for healthcare at the International Community Health Services clinic. The ICHS clinic is where he found a doctor who looks like him, more than 10 years ago.\n\n\"I like to try to get an Asian doctor, maybe we can communicate better,\" Lee said.\n\nHe added that when he comes for his appointments, he's aware of his surroundings.\n\n\"It is an easy target, especially for elderlies because Asians tend to carry cash instead of credit card,\" Lee explained. \"So easy to rob and grab the money and they don't fight.\"\n\nLee said recent news of violence has given him pause about his visits.\n\n\"I do think sometimes I want to go other places besides here, but I like the staff here and I want to stick with my primary care doctor,\" he said.\n\nICHS serves over 30,000 patients across all of its clinics. More than 10,000 seek care at the CID location, where staff have devoted more than half a century to marginalized communities. The clinic started as a place to help underprivileged Asian American Pacific Islander folks, but in 2024, the clinic is open to and serves everyone.\n\nICHS CEO Kelli Nomura said some patients have stopped coming to their CID location.\n\n\"We're here because everyone deserves access to healthcare,\" Nomura said, calling the situation \"frustrating.\" \"But they have to know it's a safe place to come.\"\n\nLast month, Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell announced a public safety executive order days after a stabbing left multiple people injured in Little Saigon, blocks away from ICHS. The executive order included the implementation of the DAT, the Downtown Activation Team, which Harrell said would be devoted to reducing crime in downtown Seattle.\n\n\"Reduce gun violence in high impact crime areas, respond to the most serious and dangerous situations,\" Harrell promised in his November press conference.\n\nThe preliminary numbers, according to Harrell's office, are showing promise.\n\n\"We’ve seen positive early results of the pilot in downtown, including a projected 27% decrease in violent crime, and are evaluating preliminary data from the expanded efforts in the CID and Little Saigon,\" a spokesperson said in a statement from the mayor's office.\n\nSeattle police data also shows that violent crime is down in the CID by 13%. Other nearby areas, though, like Pioneer Square and the downtown commercial district, are down by 20% or more.\n\n\"With any place-based strategy, there is an expected degree of migration and movement of people; however, our approach makes it clear that it is unacceptable for any one community to bear the brunt of street disorder and crime,\" the mayor's office statement read in part. \"We will continue to monitor the data and the conditions on the street to determine the areas and neighborhoods where there is a need for scheduled restoration actions and will expand the DAT model to other neighborhoods if needed.\"\n\nNomura said ever since the announcement of the pilot, she has seen some changes in the area of the clinic.\n\n\"We have seen a little more presence, and we'd certainly like to see more and we'd certainly like to see them be more responsive when an activity happens,\" Nomura said.\n\nAs for Dominic Lee, when asked if he thinks the CID has been ignored in terms of public safety, his answer was clear.\n\n\"I have to say yes,\" he said. \"Yes, because a lot of times you can see the crimes that keep repeating and see all the folks hanging out here waiting for opportunities.\"\n\nIn terms of additional public safety, efforts from the pilot project are outlined in the statement from the mayor's office below:\n\n\"In recent months, SPD has made a significant number of arrests near 12th & Jackson and Hoa Mai Park for violation of park rules, illegal firearm possession, drug possession, and outstanding warrants as part of their emphasis patrol in downtown neighborhoods. SPD will continue with these increased patrols and now have the capacity and flexibility to book misdemeanor offenses in King County Jail from the new agreement with King County. This is a significant step to hold offenders accountable for the harm they are causing in our communities and increase public safety.\n\nIn addition to increasing law enforcement presence, we will also continue to support community-based solutions, new evidence-based technology, neighborhood activation, enhanced lighting, and beautification efforts to prevent crime. Many efforts are located in the CID: the new technology pilot will deploy more tools like CCTV cameras and a Real Time Crime Center to prevent and solve crimes in the neighborhood; we’ve added canopy lights to enhance the safety of Hing Hay Park and are planning to install more at other locations in the neighborhood; our office is working with Friends of Little Saigon on the Phố Đẹp, Beautiful Neighborhood, an initiative that focuses on community-led environmental design improvements to prevent crime; and we have launched a partnership with Uplift Northwest for graffiti removal and abatement on public and private property in the neighborhood.\n\nThese current efforts build on our ongoing commitment to enhance safety in the CID. The City has reduced tent encampments in the neighborhood significantly and has offered enhanced cleaning services of streets and alleys over the last three years. Mayor Harrell will continue to advance innovative, effective, and proactive solutions to make the Chinatown-International District a safe, thriving neighborhood for all.\"",

She overcame her nearly 20-year opioid addiction after getting treatment at International Community Health Services (ICHS).\n\n“In 2018, when I came to ICHS, I was vulnerable, ashamed and terrified,” Sarah continued. “I had previously encountered judgment and indifference, which ended up pushing me deeper into the shadows of addiction.”\n\nShe became a “functioning addict,’’ she said, but missed out on “so much of the important stuff.”\n\nAt ICHS, Sarah found compassionate treatment from her medical provider, who understood that her journey could include setbacks and encouraged her recovery.\n\n“Addiction is a chronic disease that can have devastating impacts on a person and their loved ones if left untreated,” said ICHS Behavioral Health Services Director Kate McIntyre. “ICHS is ready to support those impacted by addiction with compassionate, high quality care.”\n\nWith strong roots in the Asian American and Pacific Islander community, ICHS has been at the forefront of ensuring health equity for marginalized communities with financial and language barriers across King County since our founding over 50 years ago.\n\nSince then, we have expanded our services to 11 locations to meet the needs of immigrants and refugees, and those who are uninsured and underinsured. We are committed to providing health care for all, regardless of a patient’s ability to pay.\n\nBut we can’t do it alone. Support for our community is essential in ensuring that patients like Sarah can receive treatment for addiction as well as our mental health, primary care, dental, and vision services.

      "# [ID legacy business City Produce to relocate after ICHS acquires property for affordable housing project with LIHI by Alexa Strabuk 譚文曠 on 2024-10-07](https://iexaminer.org/chinatown-id-legacy-business-city-produce-to-relocate-after-ichs-acquires-property-for-affordable-housing-project-with-lihi/)\nAt 7th Ave South and Lane Street, sits a simple sand-colored building with basic signage and a line of unmarked medium duty trucks outside. Since the 1960s, it has served as the headquarters for wholesale distributor City Produce.\n\nThe structure is located centrally, near community gathering spaces like the Donnie Chin International Children’s Park, the local branch of the Seattle Public Library system, and the International District/Chinatown Community Center, making it a valuable asset.\n\nIn March 2024, International Community Health Services (ICHS) worked with the Low Income Housing Institute (LIHI) to purchase the parcel for $7.88 million. Located a block away from ICHS’ CID medical and dental clinic, the two organizations plan to construct a mixed-use development at the new site, with 90 affordable housing units above and a healthcare facility below. LIHI is known for developing tiny house villages around the city and the An Lac Apartments on Jackson Street in Little Saigon. They also own two other properties in the neighborhood.\n\n“It’s a challenge for a nonprofit to buy property in the CID when competing with for-profit corporations and developers,” said Kelli Nomura, CEO of ICHS. “[The purchase] will offer us the opportunity to better serve our patients, to continue to work with our valuable business partners in the CID community, and to remain committed to our roots — serving the Chinatown International District and its people at an affordable cost.”\n\nAs news of the acquisition spread, community members speculated that the property’s sale meant that its longtime tenants, the legacy business City Produce, was closing, and its owners retiring. This was never the case, according to co-owner Mark Hidaka. He explained that no one from his company was informed of the sale until after the deal was completed. Otherwise, they would have entertained the idea of redeveloping the lot themselves or looking into alternative options.\n\n“We were all shocked,” said Hidaka. “We had no idea that that was even a consideration. As the original tenants, we always thought that if that situation arose, we would be at least contacted and given first right of refusal to purchase the building.”\n\n“It’s hard,” added longtime City Produce bookkeeper Sharon Suyama, the granddaughter of the business’ original owner. “I’m regretting that we didn’t try to buy the building, but we didn’t know. When the landlord talked to [business co-owner Steve Suyama], it was always, ‘You can stay here as long as you want to.’ We’ve been great tenants. We always paid our rent on time.”\n\nCity Produce is one of the oldest wholesale distributors of fresh fruits and vegetables in Seattle. It opened in 1926 at Pike Place Market by Japanese immigrant Shosaku Suyama, servicing Chinese and Japanese restaurants before later expanding to other ethnic groups such as Southeast Asian refugees when they began settling in the area. City Produce closed during World War II, when the U.S. government incarcerated 120,000 Japanese Americans after the bombing of Pearl Harbor.\n\nFortunately, an Italian family helped Suyama keep his possessions together while he was imprisoned at Minidoka, and in 1961, City Produce moved to its current location, where it has spent the majority of its existence. For years, the family operation, along with grocery store Uwajimaya, supplied the CID with its produce, even opening a retail section at one point. Today, City Produce supplies eateries from Tacoma up to Marysville, as well as the Asian Counseling and Referral Services’ neighborhood food bank and the senior living facility Nikkei Manor.\n\nHidaka joined the team at City Produce in the mid-1980s, shortly after graduating from college. A family friend of the Suyamas, he was raised in and around the CID, where his father owned a hardware store. He used to look forward to eating dinner at the now-closed Atlas and Hong Kong restaurants. Though the district has changed since Hidaka’s childhood years, some good parts remain the same, he said. That’s what makes City Produce’s relocation so bittersweet.\n\n“It costs us a lot of money to stay here because we’ve incurred a lot of damages due to vandalism and tagging. Homeless people have been doing a lot of drugs at our place, so we’ve had to do constant cleanup. It’s gotten really bad,” he said. “But the [CID] is our identity, right? I mean you don’t walk away from things like that. That’s our history and this is our community.”\n\nCity Produce previously shared the site with the wholesale fish business Okuma Fish for three years from 1985 to 1988, followed by Matthews Candies, then Monarch Trading Company, which sold Chinese canned goods in the 1990s. Now, the top floor is occupied by La Mi Nail Supply, a company that stocks nail and beauty salons.\n\n“We have strong ties with the Asian community,” said Hidaka. “Many second or third generation businesses aren’t able to survive because they’re not open to change. They’re kind of stuck in their own ways. The ability to remain flexible and be open to change is critical to survival.”\n\nHidaka first heard of the City Produce building sale from his retired business partner Pat Suyama, who heard it from his hairdresser. Later, Laurie Leak, the daughter of one of the property’s former owners, MacDougall Thomas LLC, called Hidaka to formally notify him. Apparently, the sale had been on the table since fall of 2023.\n\nLeak could not be reached for comment to confirm.\n\n“I could retire, but we have employees who have been with us for over 20 years. We worry about them. I feel a lot of loyalty to them. Trying to find a new location is not easy. It’s our home. It’s going to be a big change. It’s sad because I grew up in the community,” said Sharon Suyama.\n\nThough the 7th Ave South and Lane Street parcel is now owned by ICHS, both Nomura of ICHS and Sharon Lee, Executive Director of LIHI, clarified that the housing institute’s role in the purchase and sale was helping to investigate the site’s feasibility, engage an architect, complete environmental testing, and order an appraisal, as well as other pre-development work.\n\nThey also shared that LIHI helped ICHS conduct community notification, sending out letters “months before the purchase” to surrounding businesses and residents about the proposed construction project, including City Produce and La Ming Nail Supply, according to Lee.\n\nHidaka stood firm that no communication was received until after it was too late.\n\n“I don’t want to run anybody under the bus because that’s not what I want to do. It’s not going to change what happens,” said Hidaka. “The people who we had contact with felt really bad that we didn’t get a heads up on this thing. It kind of happened really fast.”\n\nLee said she was originally approached by a MacDougall Thomas LLC representative about LIHI’s interest in the site last year, and identified the parcel as an ideal spot for a mixed-use development that could benefit low income residents of the CID. She also emphasized that the decision to sell the lot was made by the property’s original owners, not ICHS or LIHI.\n\n“We aren’t aware of what kind of communication transpired between the owner and the tenants. The owner’s decision to sell is what is impacting the two businesses,” said Lee. “This would have occurred regardless of whether ICHS or a private developer bought the property.”\n\nHidaka said that ICHS did reach out after the sale and has been “more than accommodating” by extending the lease to sometime in 2026 while City Produce searches for a new location. Nomura added that she doesn’t know why City Produce didn’t know that their former landlords were looking to sell, but that she looks forward to working with them under their extended lease.\n\nAccording to Lee, offers of available space within the CID have already been made to City Produce, although she did not specify from whom.\n\n“We understand and appreciate the historical significance of City Produce to our community, to the neighborhood, and to the people who have been a part of their 100-year legacy,” said Nomura. “They have been in our community for a long, long time. They feed our community.”\n\nMeanwhile, City Produce hopes to stay in or near the CID if possible, even though according to Hidaka, light industry — the manufacture and production of ‘small’ consumer goods like food, textiles, vehicles, and machinery, all of which require less demanding energy compared to heavy industries like steel production or chemical plants — is no longer promoted in the district, which is now more focused on housing and restaurants.\n\nAlthough Hidaka is supportive of affordable housing, he generally feels that low income housing for homeless people is “totally different.”\n\n“[Homeless people] don’t really contribute to the economy of the district. They don’t go to Uwajimaya to shop, they don’t go to the restaurants,” said Hidaka. “Not to point fingers, but there’s a lot of collateral damage that accompanies those types of facilities. But I believe in affordable housing. It would be great if my workers could all live and work in Seattle, but they can’t because it’s too expensive.”\n\nICHS’ CID clinic is still on a lease overseen by the Seattle Chinatown International District Preservation and Development Authority (SCIDpda), and a separate lease agreement for its assisted living facility Legacy House. Nomura said that ICHS has yet to decide which of its services, departments, and programs will move to the new building once opened. The priority, she said, is to provide an improved patient care experience.\n\n“We are here now to find a path forward that allows time for City Produce to find a new location and for affordable housing and culturally competent and affordable healthcare to be a part of the community,” said Nomura.\n\nWhen City Produce does eventually relocate, Hidaka does not believe the business will change much. He said his team is still running through ideas, but that the hope is to stay nearby.\n\n“It’s nice being close to the district. It just feels good, right? It’s kind of like home. I mean, that’s just how it feels,” he said. “Everything is accessible and we’re real comfortable here. We know our neighbors, we support each other, we look out for each other, so it’s a community.

      "# [Celebrating the opening of Beacon Pacific Village by Allison Rose, DEI Creative in Seattle on 2024-11-14](https://www.weberthompson.com/beacon-pacific-village-opening/)\nWe recently gathered with partners, community leaders, and residents to celebrate a major milestone – the opening of Beacon Pacific Village. An inter-generational affordable housing project located on the historic Pacific Hospital campus in Seattle’s Beacon Hill neighborhood, this development isn’t just about housing, it’s about creating a place where families and individuals can thrive.\n\nWith 160 units for households earning 50%–60% of the Area Median Income (AMI), Beacon Pacific Village aims to provide stability and community, offsetting some of the displacement in the surrounding International District, Chinatown, and Beacon Hill neighborhoods.\n\nBy design, Beacon Pacific Village also delivers critical on-site services. Families have access to the Jose Marti Child Development Center, operated by El Centro de la Raza, while seniors benefit from the Ron Chew Healthy Aging and Wellness Center, managed by International Community Health Services (ICHS). This holistic approach ensures support for residents across generations, turning housing into a true community hub.\n\nBringing Beacon Pacific Village to life required deep collaboration. The Pacific Hospital PDA recognized the link between housing and their public health mission and saw the opportunity on an underutilized portion of their campus. The Seattle Chinatown International District PDA (SCIDpda) led the charge, managing development and community engagement, alongside Edge Developers, architect Weber Thompson, and general contractor Marpac Construction. Generous financial support came from JPMorgan Chase, Bellwether Enterprise, the City of Seattle, King County, Washington State, and Amazon’s Housing Equity Fund.\n\n“Everyone involved is invested in the mission of providing housing that allows families of all incomes to remain part of the Seattle community. It’s this shared passion and commitment that has enabled us to stay on budget, while making choices that will provide a beautiful and sustainably built place for folks to call home.”\n\n– Stephanie Farrell, Associate\n\nDuring the ceremony, SCIDpda Co-Executive Director Jamie Lee stated, “It’s been a long journey to bring this project to life, and it’s taken the dedication of so many entities and individuals to make it a reality.”\n\nThe opening also carries a sense of justice and healing for the International District community, still affected by the bisection of I-5 through the district in the 1960s and by I-90 in the 1990s. SCIDpda worked with community partners, including CISC, Interim CDA, and Horn of Africa Services, to ensure affordable housing opportunities reach those who need them most.\n\nThe thoughtful design of Beacon Pacific Village prioritizes connection, health, and wellness for its residents. The in-city location could have easily suffered from freeway and flight path noise and pollution, but triple-paned windows, Energy Recovery Ventilation, and well-insulated interior and exterior walls provide residents with thermal and acoustic comfort and healthy indoor air year-round. These same resident health “amenities” create a very green building with long-term operational savings.\n\nThe development’s central courtyard includes a large playground for childcare that can be enjoyed by residents in the off hours, bringing laughter and life to the heart of the community. Having childcare and senior care on site fosters bonds across generations and every detail, from materials to acoustics, supports both the young and the elderly. Over 20 percent of the units are family-sized, with 3- or 4-bedrooms. These units were the first to be leased, further evidence of the demand for affordable family housing in the region.\n\nSCIDpda plans for a second phase to the development that will include an additional 115-unit building. When Phase 2 is completed, the two six-story buildings will share outdoor common spaces with their adult care and childcare partners.\n\nReflecting on the excitement during the ribbon cutting ceremony, Weber Thompson appreciates that this project wouldn’t have been possible without the collaboration of our project partners.\n\n“Beacon Pacific Village isn’t just a building; it’s a promise for a stronger, more inclusive future. To every partner, supporter, and community member who made this possible—thank you.”",
      "# [What it's like to run an after hours clinic in South Seattle by International Community Health Services on 2024-11-13](https://iexaminer.org/what-its-like-to-run-an-after-hours-clinic-in-south-seattle/)\nInternational Community Health Services (ICHS) has launched Together We Rise, a wellness podcast with useful information aimed at keeping our communities safe and healthy.\n\nAfter hours medical clinics play an important role in the healthcare system by providing access to affordable medical services to people who otherwise might have no other choice but to go to an emergency room. ICHS opened its own after hours clinic at their Holly Park location in September 2023.\n\nDr. Beth Weitensteiner, site medical director at ICHS Holly Park Medical Clinic, and Tram Le, Holly Park health center manager, share their insights on running the Holly Park after hours clinic and how it is making a difference in our community.\n\nMaggie McKay (Host): Medical issues don’t always happen during business hours. Oftentimes, it’s at a very inconvenient time. So luckily, there’s the ICHS After Hours Clinic. To tell us more is Dr. Beth Weitensteiner, Site Medical Director at ICHS Holly Park Medical, and Tram Le, Health Center Manager.\n\nWelcome to Together We Rise, a podcast from International Community Health Services. ICHS advocates for health as a human right and welcomes all in need of care, regardless of health, immigration status, or ability to pay. I’m your host, Maggie McKay. Welcome Dr. Weitensteiner and Tram. So good to have you both here.\n\nDr. Beth Weitensteiner: Thank you.\n\nTram Le: Thank you.\n\nHost: Let’s start with Tram. Why did ICHS launch the Holly Park After Hours Clinic?\n\nTram Le: Well, as you mentioned, it’s to meet the demand of the acute care after the regular operation hours. The story starts with we have a lot of patients walking in around 4:30, 5:00, or calling in with the acute symptom. And during that time, we don’t have anything available for patients, and it is hard, it’s hard to turn patients away. And also, the goal is to decrease the emergency visits and/or send them to urgent care, because that’s where they can go, that’s the only two places that they can go, is to emergency and/or to an urgent care, which can be challenging for our patients where the barrier can be transportation, the barrier can be a language and wait time. It can be three, four hours in the emergency and not imagine about the cost that they will receive a bill after getting care at those facilities. And it’s also thinking about it’s a opportunity for the clinic to provide the care within the community and invite the family to establish the care, to introduce them to the family care that they need to establish the care and get healthier so they don’t have to go to the emergency department a lot after.\n\nHost: Boy, isn’t that the truth? Last time I went to the emergency room, it was an eight-hour wait. Not where you are, but still it was crazy. Dr. Weitensteiner, what types of illnesses and injuries can a patient receive treatment for there?\n\nDr. Beth Weitensteiner: So, our after hours clinic is principally focused on acute illnesses, things that happen within the last one to seven days. You’re fixing dinner, you cut your finger. You need to go someplace. You have a cold or a cough that is starting to worsen. You test positive for COVID. We can deal with all of those things. And again, as Tram iterated, it helps our patients get easier access without having to rely on our emergency rooms to fulfill those needs at this time and further stressing the healthcare system. We can take care of these things for our patients.\n\nHost: And can you go into a deep dive example of how receiving care at the After Hours Clinic benefited maybe a patient rather than going to an emergency facility?\n\nDr. Beth Weitensteiner: So, we have lots of parents with little children that end up with nausea and vomiting early on and they don’t know what to do. And our colleagues at Seattle Children’s in their emergency room certainly can deal with all of these things. But it’s a long drive for our patients from South Seattle, all the way up to the University of Washington area.\n\nAnd so, we had a couple of kids just last week that had gastroenteritis. So, stomach illness with diarrhea and the parents are going like, “What do we do?” And we said, “Come in.” Like, you don’t have to go all of that way. And we can walk them through supportive care, what they need to do to manage it. We had a patient early on when we first opened the clinic who tested positive for COVID and he was on his way to the emergency room. We said, “No, no, no, no, no, come to our parking lot.” We can take care of you here, and still take care of his family, give him quarantine guidelines, give him Paxlovid. So, it’s just really a responsive venue for our patients for just acute, urgent needs that happen to all of us.\n\nHost: What a relief for the community. I mean, that’s so much more convenient all the way around. Tram, what are some of the challenges you’ve encountered with running this service since it launched last year?\n\nTram Le: I can touch base about the operation part and then Dr. Beth can jump in and we got it integrated to the clinical part. For operation, I think hiring is the most challenging part for me as a health center manager, especially hiring for the MA. It’s not just for ICHS, but it’s a norm in healthcare right now, especially for the community health centers like us. Especially after COVID, I think the demand for healthcare staffing has being tremendous. Looking for MA, we’ve been continuing to hire, continuing facing with shortage, and the work is there, the need is there, and that is the most challenging, looking for the MA and especially working in the clinic like ours requires people who come in with the passion, understand the need of the patients, understand the culture of the patients to be able to assist the patients. That’s the most of the challenge.\n\nThe second challenge is working in the neighborhood at the Holly Park, safety is my most concern for the staff and for the patients who come to seek care in the after hours, and especially now we begin to step into the fall and the winter when it will be getting darker. We do have security on site, but with a lot of things going on, a lot of incidents happen around the neighborhood, within nearby the clinic, and some of the incidents happen at the clinic, it is raising my worry for the staff and for the patients who come and get care in the dark.\n\nDr. Beth Weitensteiner: And from a clinical perspective, I think one of our barriers and challenges that we’re trying to work through is the lack of 24-hour pharmacies now inside the city of Seattle and close to Holly Park. Almost all pharmacies close between 6:00 and 7:00 at night. And so, to prescribe something for a patient that could help them right then and there, but if they came in at 8:00, then they’re usually waiting for the next day to do it. So, we’re trying to look at whether or not our pharmacy, whether it’s financially feasible for us to remain open with our pharmacy to help our after hours patients. So, it’s something we’ll explore in this coming year 2025.\n\nHost: And how does the quality of care during after hours compare to, say, regular business hours? And are there ways for improvement?\n\nDr. Beth Weitensteiner: So, we’re really pleased and honored with all of our providers at Holly Park and all members of our medical team. The quality of medical care that’s provided at all ICHS clinics is really high quality. We are a gold medal HRSA quality award winner this past year. And so, the quality doesn’t change, just because you come at 5:00 to 9:00, you still get a compassionate and caring provider who is going to deliver culturally and linguistically appropriate care to our patients. We really are fortunate to have just an amazing, outstanding team, front desk to back office, just really an amazing team.\n\nHost: That’s so important, right? Tram, what does the community say? What’s their response been to the ICHS after hours clinic since you opened?\n\nTram Le: The clinic is open up to both ICHS and non-ICHS patients, and we are really happy to say that it’s well accepted by our community. The clinic is gradually getting busier and busier, and I can say that it’s by the word of mouth, more than any advertising. By 5:00, when I go to the waiting lobby, the waiting lobby is already filled with patients who are waiting for the after hour clinic. And by 6:00, the clinic already has 10 patients scheduled. So, we are already in the talking of should we adding another provider for this coming flu season, when we know that the respiratory season is coming during the flu season because now we’re talking about the demand during this season.\n\nSo, we can tell that it’s really accepted by the community and 20% of our patients who are seen during the after hour clinic is our new patients. And out of that 20% of new patients, 50-60% is established care with ICHS afterward. So, it’s really a happy news for us because it means that they get the care that they need. We’ll be able to take care of them and make themselves and their family healthy.\n\nHost: Dr. Weitensteiner, would you like to add anything?\n\nDr. Beth Weitensteiner: I just confirm Tram’s sense of what our community response is. They come back, and they tell their friends and family, which reinforces that the product, the care that we provide are really helpful to the community. And we are all about taking care of people here at Holly Park.\n\nHost: Well, thank you both so much for sharing this useful information. We appreciate your time.\n\nDr. Beth Weitensteiner: Thank you.",

In April 2016 all OPV-using countries simultaneously switched routine polio vaccination from tOPV to bivalent OPV (bOPV), which contains vaccine for only types 1 and 3 polioviruses. Monovalent OPV (mOPV) is also used during an outbreak response. As a result, the CDC ACIP recommended schedule says doses of OPV administered on or after 04/01/2016, should not be counted. For the polio series to be evaluated correctly in the WAIIS OPV doses on or after 04/01/2016 should be documented as bOPV or OPV-unspecified so they are not counted as valid in the series completion. In mid-December of 2024, WA DOH will begin changing doses incorrectly documented as tOPV to OPV-unspecified to ensure that the doses are correctly evaluated by the WAIIS forecaster. This could result in new patients being forecasted as needing additional polio vaccine. Please vaccinate these patients with additional doses of IPV according to the Immunization Schedules | Vaccines & Immunizations | CDC. Additionally, please ensure that your facility is correctly documenting OPV doses on or after 04/01/2016 as bOPV or OPV-unspecified. Only OPV doses before this date should be documented as tOPV.

    "# Comprehensive Analyst Report on International Community Health Services (ICHS)\n\n## Company Overview\n\nInternational Community Health Services (ICHS) is a federally qualified community health center based in Seattle, Washington, dedicated to providing high-quality, accessible healthcare to underserved populations, particularly immigrants and refugees. Founded over 50 years ago, ICHS has expanded its services to 11 locations, serving over 31,000 patients annually, with a significant focus on the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities [(Kelli Nomura, N.A.P, 2024-12-16)](https://napost.com/2024/news1-12132024/). The organization is committed to health equity, ensuring that all individuals, regardless of language, immigration status, or financial barriers, have access to necessary healthcare services [(ICHS, 2024-12-21)](https://iexaminer.org/ichs-give-the-gift-of-help-to-people-in-need/).\n\n## Recent Achievements and Recognition\n\nICHS was recently ranked as Washington State’s No. 1 community health center in Medicaid Cost and Quality by the Washington Health Alliance in their 2024 Community Checkup report. This recognition highlights ICHS's commitment to delivering high-quality care at a responsible cost, with 47% of its patients on Medicaid insurance plans [(ICHS, 2024-12-09)](https://www.king5.com/article/news/community/facing-race/violent-crime-cid-deterring-patients-seeking-medical-care/281-516aaf68-830b-47d4-a865-bf6490aa89a1). Dr. Deepa Lakshimi Yerram, ICHS Chief Medical Officer, emphasized that this ranking serves as a validation of their dedication to serving the community with high standards of care [(ICHS, 2024-12-09)](https://www.king5.com/article/news/community/facing-race/violent-crime-cid-deterring-patients-seeking-medical-care/281-516aaf68-830b-47d4-a865-bf6490aa89a1).\n\n## Leadership and Executive Team\n\nKelli Nomura, the CEO of ICHS, has been recognized as a Diversity Champion by the Puget Sound Business Journal for her commitment to health equity and advocacy for low-income individuals.

With a strong commitment to health equity, innovative programs, and community engagement, ICHS is well-positioned to continue making a significant impact in the healthcare landscape. Prospective candidates and investors should consider ICHS not only for its achievements but also for its ongoing efforts to address the evolving needs of the communities it serves."
