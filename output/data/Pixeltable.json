      "# [Pixeltable launches AI data infrastructure providing a declarative, incremental approach for multimodal workloads transforming, how teams build AI applications – Pixeltable](https://pixeltable.com/blog/pixeltable-launches-ai-data-infrastructure-providing-a-declarative-incremental-approach-for-multimodal-workloads-transforming-how-teams-build-ai-applications/)\nSAN FRANCISCO, CA, December 5, 2023 — Pixeltable today announced the launch of its open-source AI data infrastructure, backed by a $5.5 million seed round led by The General Partnership, with participation from Exceptional Capital, South Park Commons, Liquid 2, Zero Knowledge Ventures, Serena Data ventures, and notable industry veterans including Christian Beedgen (cofounder of Sumo Logic), Michael Stoppelman (Angel Investor & Former SVP of Engineering at Yelp), Wes McKinney (Principal Architect, Posit), Bill Hsieh (Bridge Street Advisors), and Steven Mih (CEO Across AI, former CEO of Aviatrix, Alluxio, and Ahana).\n\nAs AI applications become increasingly multimodal and complex, teams spend more time managing infrastructure than innovating. Pixeltable solves this by providing a unified declarative interface that handles multimodal data workloads, incremental updates and lineage tracking, reducing infrastructure code by up to 80% and compute waste by 50%.\n\n“Just as relational databases revolutionized web development, Pixeltable is transforming AI application development,” said Marcel Kornacker, CTO and co-founder of Pixeltable. “Our platform removes the need for in-house scripting of multimodal data management and orchestration, and reduces compute costs and maintenance overhead, enabling teams to deploy production AI applications in days instead of months.”\n\nRevolutionizing AI Application Development\n\nPixeltable’s key innovations include:\n\nUnified multimodal interface: Handle video, images, audio, and text with structured and unstructured data living side by side through a consistent, intuitive table API\n\nAutomatic incremental updates: Only process new data, eliminating redundant computation\n\nCombined lineage and versioning: Track transformations from data to model inferences in one place\n\nDevelopment-to-production mirror: Same code works in both environments without rewrites\n\nFlexible integration & extensibility: Use built-in and custom Python functions (UDFs) while building tables through any standard frameworks and formats\n\nFor instance, complete video, audio and frames processing workloads can be built in just a few lines, without sacrificing algorithmic flexibility.\n\nReal-World Impact: The PixelBot Showcase\n\nThe power of Pixeltable’s approach is demonstrated through PixelBot (code), a context-aware Discord chatbot that showcases how Pixeltable solves current challenges in AI development, such as maintaining embedding indices and providing data lineage and versioning from raw data to LLM outputs.\n\n“Most AI teams face a difficult choice today,” explains Pierre Brunelle, CEO and co-founder of Pixeltable. “Either they spend months building complex infrastructure for production-ready AI applications, or they use high-level frameworks that prevent critical use cases and limit their ability to innovate. Pixeltable eliminates this tradeoff. With our declarative approach, developers can build production-grade AI applications with infinite memory and real-time context awareness in less than 100 lines of code, while maintaining full control over their custom application logics. Teams no longer have to choose between ease of development and control over their application logic.”\n\nIndustry Validation\n\n“Pixeltable has transformed our computer vision workflow,” said Adil Mohammad, Founding Engineer at Obvio and formerly Senior Deep Learning Engineer at Nvidia. “Before Pixeltable, our engineers spent 80% of their time on data plumbing. Now, they can focus on what truly matters—building better models and delivering value to our customers. With Pixeltable, we’ve reduced our infrastructure code by 90%, cut compute costs by 70%, and dramatically accelerated model iteration cycles. Its seamless integration into existing vision workflows means our team can rapidly experiment and iterate, delivering high-impact solutions faster than ever.”\n\nBeyond computer vision, Pixeltable is seeing strong adoption in generative AI applications, particularly for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The unified approach to data management streamlines RAG workflows by combining document storage, embedding computation, and incremental indexing.\n\n“Pixeltable has transformed how our ML engineers spend their time,” said Denise Kutnick, CEO of Variata, formerly Director of MLSys Product at OctoAI. “We have a highly multimodal use case, and Pixeltable gives us full visibility into the input data, models, and incremental steps of our system’s pipeline.”\n\nProven Results\n\nEarly adopters report significant improvements:\n\nReduction in infrastructure code\n\nDecrease in compute costs through incremental processing\n\nReduction in development time\n\nZero infrastructure management overhead\n\nPixeltable has also released a suite of sample AI applications on Hugging Face (huggingface.co/Pixeltable), demonstrating Pixeltable’s versatility across use cases from document processing to video analysis.\n\nIndustry Veterans at the Helm\n\nThe company was founded by:\n\nMarcel Kornacker, founder of Apache Impala and co-founder of Apache Parquet, ex-Cloudera & Google\n\nAaron Siegel, former Head of Data Platform at Airbnb and Twitter, and Head of Data at Chainlink\n\nPierre Brunelle, former CEO of Noteable (acquired by Confluent), ex-Amazon\n\n“At Airbnb, I witnessed firsthand how ML teams struggle with data,” said Aaron Siegel, co-founder and Chief AI Officer at Pixeltable. “Teams often spent more time on data plumbing than on developing their actual application logic. The recent proliferation of generative AI tools and increasing multimodality of ML workloads has only made the situation worse.“\n\nMoving Forward\n\nThe seed funding will accelerate Pixeltable’s development, focusing on:\n\nExpanding core infrastructure capabilities\n\nBuilding collaboration features focused on multimodal data management\n\nDeveloping Pixeltable Cloud, a fully-managed service\n\nPixeltable is available now as an open-source project on GitHub under the Apache 2.0 License: https://github.com/pixeltable/pixeltable\n\nAbout Pixeltable\n\nPixeltable redefines data infrastructure for AI application development. It unifies data storage, versioning, and indexing with orchestration and model versioning under a declarative table interface. By representing transformations, model inference, and custom logic as computed columns, Pixeltable enables Data Scientists and ML Engineers to focus on modeling and experimentation rather than data plumbing. With incremental updates and built-in data operation tracing, Pixeltable significantly reduces development time and resource usage while enhancing reproducibility.

The way it runs on PixelTable looks extremely slick, but in the only video of sample play I could find online, the group ran into a couple of hiccups that really didn't seem to be the fault of any of the players.  Anyone experienced in running AiM on PixelTable, and if so, what has that experience been like?\n\n## Comment ID lqmuj4m with +2 score by [(Roman_Statuesque, Reddit, 2024-10-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1fxixz2/anyone_experienced_playing_alice_is_missing_on/lqmuj4m/) (in reply to ID 1fxixz2):\nIt went pretty well. Though most of my players had played the in person version before. Would advise people to pay attention for their audio cues to proceed. It isn't too different from playing the normal game. I did think scrolling through the chats was a bit difficult however, it doesn't work the same way as messaging on your phone or discord. IIRC, a new message would automatically snap you to the bottom or something along those lines, so reading older messages in active chats could be a bit of a hassle. \n\nOh! And the music just stopped abruptly for us near the end, but that was more of a technical glitch. Next time I run it I'll see if there have been any changes/improvements. \n\nFor context, the version I own includes the Silent Falls Expansion.\n\n### Comment ID lqo75cn with +1 score by [(Jilliterate, Reddit, 2024-10-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1fxixz2/anyone_experienced_playing_alice_is_missing_on/lqo75cn/) (in reply to ID lqmuj4m):\nGood to know, thanks for the reply! <3\n\n## Comment ID lqo37p0 with +2 score by [(CluelessMonger, Reddit, 2024-10-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1fxixz2/anyone_experienced_playing_alice_is_missing_on/lqo37p0/) (in reply to ID 1fxixz2):\nHow old was the video that you saw?

You'll still have to read the rule book (which is very good and has parts that can just be read verbatim to the group during the prep phase). What sets Pixeltable apart from eg roll20 is that you get everything in one window (cards, chats, soundtrack, voicemail) and the cards are dealt automatically. So, I don't think being the facilitator is too much work either way.\n\n\n\nHowever. Pixeltable is just an app to run the game digitally. It does not include the full rules.

I opted for the Digital Edition thinking this suited our needs and would be all we needed to learn and play. However, having looked at it and attempted to get my head around the game before hand, I really can't seem to find much guidance for the Facilitator. There are several areas on the platform to resolve pre-game, like relationships, locations, and the voicemail, but no real explanation of what to do or how to approach these. The little guide seems more player focused. Am I missing something, or is this version devoid of a manual/rulebook of sorts and do I need this separately?\n\n## Comment ID lwmtku3 with +3 score by [(mresler, Reddit, 2024-11-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1gp1fkm/alice_is_missing_digital_edition/lwmtku3/) (in reply to ID 1gp1fkm):\nAre you talking about the version accessible through Pixeltable?\n\n### Comment ID lwmujib with +3 score by [(mresler, Reddit, 2024-11-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1gp1fkm/alice_is_missing_digital_edition/lwmujib/) (in reply to ID lwmtku3):\nIf you go to [https://www.huntersentertainment.com/alice-is-missing](https://www.huntersentertainment.com/alice-is-missing) and scroll to the bottom, you'll see a few free sheets available to download.

We host everything in a Kubernetes cluster that we scale based on the number of tasks in the queue.\n\nWe built our logging for all the LLM calls following the pattern of Langsmith.

We use layers for shared logic across lambdas.\n\nAnother serverless model that I am currently working on is using SQS/Lambdas, and its the bees knees. If you set up SQS as your agent message exchange, you can distribute the queue consumers across lambdas, kubes, or anything else, to scale out individual parts. Heres an example message framework architecture, which is the backbone of my project:\nhttps://github.com/alekst23/creo-1\n\nI made an RPG game that uses something like 10 diff agent roles, which all sync using CREO-1, and I am porting it to Lambdas now.\n\nThis message orchestration pattern, or MOP, can be used for agent-agent or agent-tool comms.\n\n## Comment ID m5mmbkb with +6 score by [(FeistyCommercial3932, Reddit, 2025-01-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_Agents/comments/1hu29l6/how_are_youll_deploying_ai_agent_systems_to/m5mmbkb/) (in reply to ID 1hu29l6):\nMe and my team had launched an investment chatbot using agentic RAG pipelines. We primarily use EKS to serve the application and pipeline logics (written in typescript), embedding model on Sagemaker, and we used Qdrant as vectorDB, mongo and postgres (mostly application level data). I had spent much of my time focusing on scalability and the stability. \n\nMy experiences to AI/LLM deployments are:\n\n1. When using external services especially when AI-related, like LLM providers or some 3rd part tools like web crawling, embedding, etc, it could be be easily reaching the rate limit and there could be cost concern as user base increases. \n   1. For my case most of our agents used OpenAI API via Azure, they do have rate limit. We estimated how many concurrent requests we can run with each model given the rate limits (and cost concern). We then decided to use smaller models whenever possible and only use larger models like gpt4o on complex prompts that requires reasoning. The main point here is you have to take balance.\n   2. An important point is always apply queues onto the agents whenever asynchronous response is possible, just to make sure there won’t be a request spike that reaching our server limit or external rate limits. (Unless you are developing apps that had to respond quickly like chatbots)\n2. AI agents are hard to debug.\n   1. it is hard to 100% reproduce how LLM responds, even configuring a very low temperature it still introduce some randomness. That makes overall output unpredictable especially our pipeline chained multiple agents together. And since live end-users only request once, we have to log it throughly since we can never reproduce. I personally think of LLMs a blackbox, all you can see is the inputs and outputs, so I made sure I log all of them. \n   2. In my case where I did not use langchain or any popular frameworks. I had wrote my own library to help logging all the inputs (user request / data the agent fetched), and outputs (LLM’s decision / answering) and the response time of the agents. ([https://github.com/lokwkin/steps-track](https://github.com/lokwkin/steps-track), feel free to try it if you are using Typescript). I even integrated the logger with slack so our team could easily retrieve what agents the pipeline has gone through and what are the inputs and how they responded.\n3. Resource challenge when self-hosting:\n   1. We had also deployed our embedding service on AWS sagemaker, there we had to choose whether we use “serverless”  that requires warm up time, or “real-time” inferencing that machine is always-on, but it charges even if it is idle. We finally go for real-time mode as the warm up time took more than 30s and was unacceptable to us.\n   2. We used Qdrant as vector DB which we deployed on AWS. Qdrant by default stores everything onto memory. As more data loads in, it came to a point where a single machine does not have enough memory. We ended up had to store part of the data in hard disk and spent time sharding it into multiple instances, so each instance stores different set of data.\n\nThese are the engineering challenges I faced, but QA and evaluation are another big pieces.\n\n### Comment ID m5ngnms with +2 score by [(Blitch89, Reddit, 2025-01-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_Agents/comments/1hu29l6/how_are_youll_deploying_ai_agent_systems_to/m5ngnms/) (in reply to ID m5mmbkb):\nI’m new to all of this, could you explain the queues onto for async agents part in 1. 2.\n\nIn 2.

In the live enviornment people can tolerate for delays for certain tasks -- For example if they do file upload and process, they probably can expect a waiting time of few minute or so. If 100 users suddenly upload files at the same moment, you can queue them and process 1 by 1 or using max 10 concurrent workers etc, as soon as each user gets their respond within say 3 minutes and they see a fancy loading UI notifying their job is done then they are happy. This way you don't have to prepare too many server resources stand-by for the spike.\n\n\n\nFor 2) My personal view is that writing my own logic gives me full-control. When you decide to launch your app, you want it being keep further developed and maintained for a year or more. You would be adding more and more feature and customizations. Soon it is very easy to get to a point where the opensource / 3rd party maintained framework isn’t comprehensive enough to support your wish. At that moment you will be either spending even more time customizing the 3rd party projects, or start over and build your self-tool.\n\nI didn’t study on langfuse so I couldn’t comment on it. I think if it is simple and light-weight enough it won’t harm using it and save your time. But make sure you won’t end up spending more time studying how to use langfuse instead of your own application.\n\n\n\nFor 3) yes it is cold start. Not necessary just once, because the serverless mechanism (as I remember correctly) basically scales out machines when there is more requests. Every fresh machine would need the cold start time, and the machine might rotates periodically.  (p.s. Im not an expert here so not 100% sure on this)\n\n## Comment ID m5jmur6 with +5 score by [(Purple-Print4487, Reddit, 2025-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_Agents/comments/1hu29l6/how_are_youll_deploying_ai_agent_systems_to/m5jmur6/) (in reply to ID 1hu29l6):\nWhen we move from the playground to a real life (enterprise) environment, the issues of MLOps and deployment specifically become the focus.\n\nI recommend relying on a proven infrastructure such as the AWS cloud, and specifically on Step Functions and Lambda.

Similar to yours the user uploads some documents and multiple modules are called to do something and after sometime the results are shown.\n\n### Comment ID m3bdc5k with +1 score by [(AdministrativeRub484, Reddit, 2024-12-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1hk1ot7/ml_pipeline_questions/m3bdc5k/) (in reply to ID m3bcb8m):\nI thought databricks only allowed for ETL pipelines or batch jobs. This goes back to my first question: I thought these sorts of pipelines were only capable of handling batch jobs... how do you make it such that it triggers every time a user uploads a document?\n\n#### Comment ID m3l9kop with +1 score by [(_Useless_Scientist_, Reddit, 2024-12-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1hk1ot7/ml_pipeline_questions/m3l9kop/) (in reply to ID m3bdc5k):\nDatabricks is by now pretty advanced. It offers various triggers & also streaming options.\nI cannot tell you how exactly it works as I took a sabbatical for 24, but been working with it the past 2.5years before that.\nDepending on your cloud options I assume Azure ML and AWS (don't know the equivalent) might offer some easier to run solutions as well.\n\n## Comment ID m3bqvi4 with +1 score by [(JP_AKA_MEGATRON, Reddit, 2024-12-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1hk1ot7/ml_pipeline_questions/m3bqvi4/) (in reply to ID 1hk1ot7):\nFor all of our pipelines including batch transformation jobs, training, etc. we use prefect cloud with AWS ECS as our compute backend. It is a little finicky getting it to work with GPU instances but once it’s setup it works like a charm\n\n## Comment ID m3eyu63 with +1 score by [(justanidea_while0, Reddit, 2024-12-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1hk1ot7/ml_pipeline_questions/m3eyu63/) (in reply to ID 1hk1ot7):\nI actually worked on something similar not long ago. We went with a simpler approach than Kubernetes - FastAPI for the web interface with Celery handling the task queue, all in Docker Compose.\n\nFor the video processing flow, it's pretty straightforward: FastAPI takes the upload and kicks off a Celery task Different Celery workers handle specific jobs (GPU workers for ASR, CPU workers for translation, etc) Results go to Redis for quick status checks, then to PostgreSQL/S3 for storage\n\nWe looked at Ray and Kubernetes too, but honestly it felt like overkill for what we needed. The Celery setup handles both sequential and parallel tasks just fine, and when something breaks, it's way easier to figure out what went wrong.\n\nThe thing that surprised me was how well it scaled. We're not handling massive volume, but it's dealing with a few hundred videos a day without breaking a sweat.\n\nQuick tip though - if you do go this route, set up proper monitoring early. Learned that one the hard way when we had tasks silently failing for a day before anyone noticed.\n\n### Comment ID m3ilqxg with +1 score by [(justanaccname, Reddit, 2024-12-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1hk1ot7/ml_pipeline_questions/m3ilqxg/) (in reply to ID m3eyu63):\nThat's exactly how i would be doing that.  \nMight exchange the Celery part, but the general idea is the same.   \nDifferent compute pools for sane scaling rules, consume from Queues / Message topics, have a fast db for status updates, then a db for meta, and distributed storage for the files.\n\n## Comment ID m3ise3u with +1 score by [(zubaplants, Reddit, 2024-12-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1hk1ot7/ml_pipeline_questions/m3ise3u/) (in reply to ID 1hk1ot7):\nML pipelines are typically meant to mean an automated (mostly) process of pulling data, training, testing, and then deploying. Serving usually isn't part of the equation. However the ML pipeline might \\*deploy\\* it to some other set of serving infrastructure.\n\nDepends on what you want to serve? If it's a regular ole serialized python object you have a few options.\n\nWrap it in something like flask and put it behind some sort of web server (ngnix, apache, whatever) and make REST/Http calls. Push it into something like amazon sage maker (or whatever cloud provider) and make calls via their library. Setup something like Nvidia Triton. Usually pushing it to a cloud or SAAS (e.g. databricks) providers existing ml serving infra is going to be the easiest.\n\n## Comment ID m3knwys with +1 score by [(positive-correlation, Reddit, 2024-12-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1hk1ot7/ml_pipeline_questions/m3knwys/) (in reply to ID 1hk1ot7):\n1. You need a scheduler (not specific to ML). Ray, Metaflow, Dask, Prefect, Airflow… find the one that suits your needs the best. \n2. Infrastructure layer. How much dependency to a cloud provider can you tolerate? Kubernetes is flexible and scalable, but it can be hard to setup. See if you can start building without at first, then gradually improve your architecture as you better understand the problem. \n\nAlso, I came across a cool project that helps simplifying data infrastructure for multi-modal workloads and I thought it would be interesting to mention it: [Pixeltable](https://pixeltable.com) abstracts away representation and storage for images, video, text, etc. It might be relevant, ymmv.\n\n## Comment ID m5a0y2l with +1 score by [(SaintJohn40, Reddit, 2025-01-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1hk1ot7/ml_pipeline_questions/m5a0y2l/) (in reply to ID 1hk1ot7):\nKubeflow and Vertex AI are more suited for model training and batch processing rather than real-time serving. For online inference, consider using tools like Ray with Kubernetes, TensorFlow Serving, or TorchServe. These tools help manage multi-model serving with different hardware requirements.",

I personally wouldn't go into dark themes, but it kind of feels like the nature of the game.\n\nI originally bought it to run for my team at work when we were all traveling due to the text mechanics. But after skimming through the rules and realizing what kind of topics might come up, I noped the fuck out of that idea."

      "# [Pixeltable launches AI data infrastructure providing a declarative, incremental approach for multimodal workloads transforming, how teams build AI applications – Pixeltable](https://pixeltable.com/blog/pixeltable-launches-ai-data-infrastructure-providing-a-declarative-incremental-approach-for-multimodal-workloads-transforming-how-teams-build-ai-applications/)\nSAN FRANCISCO, CA, December 5, 2023 — Pixeltable today announced the launch of its open-source AI data infrastructure, backed by a $5.5 million seed round led by The General Partnership, with participation from Exceptional Capital, South Park Commons, Liquid 2, Zero Knowledge Ventures, Serena Data ventures, and notable industry veterans including Christian Beedgen (cofounder of Sumo Logic), Michael Stoppelman (Angel Investor & Former SVP of Engineering at Yelp), Wes McKinney (Principal Architect, Posit), Bill Hsieh (Bridge Street Advisors), and Steven Mih (CEO Across AI, former CEO of Aviatrix, Alluxio, and Ahana).\n\nAs AI applications become increasingly multimodal and complex, teams spend more time managing infrastructure than innovating. Pixeltable solves this by providing a unified declarative interface that handles multimodal data workloads, incremental updates and lineage tracking, reducing infrastructure code by up to 80% and compute waste by 50%.\n\n“Just as relational databases revolutionized web development, Pixeltable is transforming AI application development,” said Marcel Kornacker, CTO and co-founder of Pixeltable. “Our platform removes the need for in-house scripting of multimodal data management and orchestration, and reduces compute costs and maintenance overhead, enabling teams to deploy production AI applications in days instead of months.”\n\nRevolutionizing AI Application Development\n\nPixeltable’s key innovations include:\n\nUnified multimodal interface: Handle video, images, audio, and text with structured and unstructured data living side by side through a consistent, intuitive table API\n\nAutomatic incremental updates: Only process new data, eliminating redundant computation\n\nCombined lineage and versioning: Track transformations from data to model inferences in one place\n\nDevelopment-to-production mirror: Same code works in both environments without rewrites\n\nFlexible integration & extensibility: Use built-in and custom Python functions (UDFs) while building tables through any standard frameworks and formats\n\nFor instance, complete video, audio and frames processing workloads can be built in just a few lines, without sacrificing algorithmic flexibility.\n\nReal-World Impact: The PixelBot Showcase\n\nThe power of Pixeltable’s approach is demonstrated through PixelBot (code), a context-aware Discord chatbot that showcases how Pixeltable solves current challenges in AI development, such as maintaining embedding indices and providing data lineage and versioning from raw data to LLM outputs.\n\n“Most AI teams face a difficult choice today,” explains Pierre Brunelle, CEO and co-founder of Pixeltable. “Either they spend months building complex infrastructure for production-ready AI applications, or they use high-level frameworks that prevent critical use cases and limit their ability to innovate. Pixeltable eliminates this tradeoff. With our declarative approach, developers can build production-grade AI applications with infinite memory and real-time context awareness in less than 100 lines of code, while maintaining full control over their custom application logics. Teams no longer have to choose between ease of development and control over their application logic.”\n\nIndustry Validation\n\n“Pixeltable has transformed our computer vision workflow,” said Adil Mohammad, Founding Engineer at Obvio and formerly Senior Deep Learning Engineer at Nvidia. “Before Pixeltable, our engineers spent 80% of their time on data plumbing. Now, they can focus on what truly matters—building better models and delivering value to our customers. With Pixeltable, we’ve reduced our infrastructure code by 90%, cut compute costs by 70%, and dramatically accelerated model iteration cycles. Its seamless integration into existing vision workflows means our team can rapidly experiment and iterate, delivering high-impact solutions faster than ever.”\n\nBeyond computer vision, Pixeltable is seeing strong adoption in generative AI applications, particularly for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

      "# [Help Needed: Building an AI-Based Real-Time YouTube Video Analysis System by taimur.azaidi on 2024-07-11](https://community.openai.com/t/help-needed-building-an-ai-based-real-time-youtube-video-analysis-system/862450)\nHi everyone,\n\nI have an idea for a project that I think could be really cool and useful. The goal is to create a system that uses GPT-3/4 to watch, transcribe, and analyze YouTube videos in real-time. This would be especially handy for keeping up with live news and other important video content.\n\nWhat I’m Thinking:\n\nReal-Time Monitoring: The system continuously watches YouTube videos.\n\nTranscription: Converts the audio from videos to text using speech-to-text services.\n\nNLP Analysis: Uses GPT-3/4 to summarize and analyze the transcribed text.\n\nUser Interface: A simple platform where users can ask questions and get feedback.\n\nWhy This is Useful:\n\nQuickly get summaries and key points from videos.\n\nStay updated with live news and other timely content.\n\nGreat for news agencies, content creators, and educators.\n\nWhat I Need:\n\nDevelopers/Engineers: For backend and frontend development, API integration, and cloud services.\n\nAI/ML Experts: For NLP, speech-to-text tech, and GPT model fine-tuning.\n\nAny Feedback: Suggestions, advice, or resources to help make this happen.\n\nIf you’re interested in helping out or have any tips, please let me know!\n\nThanks!\n\nWelcome to the Community!\n\nThanks for sharing your idea. Having implemented an end-to-end automated news tracking platform for a niche domain I am working in, I have a couple of thoughts on this. This is purely my personal opinion, so please take it with a grain of salt.\n\nI generally don’t see the conversion of Youtube content as the most efficient and cost-friendly way to source information/news. In particular, in many cases a Youtube video is not the primary source of news but the video creators likely rely on other sources of information themselves. With that in mind I would likely focus more on identifying the primary information source, such as websites, and then use this as a basis for news tracking and the subsequent summarization and analysis.\n\nFurthermore, I would bear in mind that “news” is a very broad concept and you should at least in the initial phase identify a particular category / domain of news or geography that you want to focus on. Ideally it is an area that you have particular expertise in and/or an area where a similar service is currently not available. Expertise is also particularly important when it comes to the news analysis as you want to ensure a tailored approach.\n\nOverall, technically your idea is absolutely doable. However, as per my other comments, I would re-evaluate whether Youtube videos are really the best source of information as well as encourage you to identify a niche where such a service is not yet (widely) available and where you have particular expertise in.\n\nThanks for the feedback! I really appreciate your insights.\n\nI understand that YouTube might not be the most efficient or cost-effective way to source news, as many videos indeed draw from other primary sources. However, I believe there are several compelling reasons to focus on YouTube content:\n\nRich Multimedia Content: YouTube videos often combine visuals, audio, and text, providing a rich source of information that goes beyond what’s available in text-based articles alone.\n\nReal-Time Updates: Many news channels and content creators on YouTube provide live updates and real-time information, which can be invaluable for staying current with ongoing events.\n\nPublic Sentiment and Commentary: YouTube comments and interactions provide an additional layer of public sentiment and immediate feedback that can be analyzed for trends and opinions.\n\nAccessibility: Videos are a popular medium for consuming information, especially for people who prefer watching over reading. By transcribing and summarizing video content, we can make this information more accessible to a wider audience.\n\nSupplementary to Text Sources: While primary text sources are crucial, video content can supplement these by providing different perspectives, interviews, and visual context that text articles might not capture.\n\nNiche Content: There are many niche content creators on YouTube who cover specialized topics that may not be covered by mainstream news outlets. This can provide unique insights and information that might otherwise be missed.\n\nEnhanced Analysis with GPT: GPT-3/4 has vast learning capabilities and can integrate information from multiple sources, including YouTube, to provide better analysis and more comprehensive answers. For example, during significant events or breaking news, detailed discussions, interviews, and real-time updates are often available on YouTube, which can be crucial for a thorough understanding of the topic. By including YouTube content in its search capabilities, GPT can study and analyze these diverse inputs to offer more informed and accurate responses.\n\nFuture Potential: As video content continues to grow in popularity, having a robust system to analyze and summarize this content will become increasingly valuable.\n\nI appreciate your point about focusing on a specific category or domain initially. I plan to narrow down the scope to a particular type of news or a specific geographic region to start with, which aligns with your advice on leveraging expertise and ensuring a tailored approach.\n\nThank you again for your valuable feedback. I’m excited about the potential of this project and look forward to any further suggestions or insights you might have.",

      "# [Data Council 2025: The Databases Track with Sai Krishna Srirampur and Craig Kerstiens on 2025-03-27](https://www.heavybit.com/library/article/data-council-2025-the-databases-track-with-sai-krishna-srirampur-and-craig-kerstiens)\nCraig Kerstiens\n\nSai Krishna Srirampur\n\nMAR 27, 2025\n\nHeavybit is thrilled to be sponsoring Data Council 2025, and we invite you to join us in Oakland from Apr 22-24 to experience 3 days of cutting-edge technical talks from the brightest minds in AI & data, learn more at datacouncil.ai and use the code HEAVYBIT20 for 20% off.\n\nIntroduction and Sai’s Journey into Databases\n\nCraig Kerstiens: So I'm Craig Kerstiens, Chief Product Officer at Crunchy Data. I've got with me Sai who I'm actually really excited to talk to because I've known Sai for quite a while, since he was first in the industry.\n\nSai's seen and done a lot, and now is part of ClickHouse, helping people scale data warehouse loads.\n\nBut I'm really excited with the track that he's created, but I wanted to kind of, you know...\n\nSai, don't let me take away your introduction and, you know, give your own background if I missed a bunch of things.\n\nBut once you kind of give some of that, I'm really curious to drill into, first, something I've ever asked you, what drove you to databases in the first place?\n\nLike, how did you end up in the data world? What brought you into it? So first, if you want to add anything to your own background and then, like, why database is for you personally.\n\nSai Krishna Srirampur: Thanks, Craig. So just to start with my background, right?\n\nSo yeah, hi folks, I'm very excited to be here, and thanks Heavybit for hosting this great podcast.\n\nAnd I'm Sai and currently, I work at ClickHouse and I lead database integration efforts at ClickHouse.\n\nSo what my team does is we are responsible for providing a magical experience for customers to integrate external data stores with ClickHouse.\n\nPrior to ClickHouse, I was the CEO and co-founder at PeerDB. And at PeerDB, we are building a data replication tool with laser focus on Postgres.\n\nSo our unique insight was we were really focused on Postgres and we were making it very easy for customers to move data from Postgres to external data stores.\n\nAnd one of the data store was ClickHouse, and we added that connector and that took off. And that is why the acquisition happened.\n\nAnd prior to that, Citus and Microsoft were really transformative in my life because that's where I got introduced to Postgres and that's what instilled passion in me of databases, right? Like, I got to work with a bunch of customers, right?\n\nAnd in Citus, it was mostly SMBs, like, startups, right? And myself and Craig, like I would say that we sold Citus Cloud together, right?\n\nAnd at Microsoft, it was a counterpart, we were working with Fortune 400 companies who were running Postgres at scale, right? They were running Postgres at hundreds of terabytes.\n\nI feel that like Citus and Microsoft were transformative in my career because that's where I could see how customers are using Postgres and what are the problems that they were running into, right? And that's where PeerDB came from.\n\nSo what I observed was that moving data in and out of Postgres was a big problem, right?\n\nLet it be related to migrations, right? Or let it be moving data to data warehouses, right? So that experience was not very performant.\n\nIt was not very scalable because existing data movement and ETL tools were all generalized, right?\n\nSo they were not laser-focused on Postgres, right?\n\nSo that was the unique insight that we identified and that's the reason we started PeerDB with this vision of building a laser-focused, like, data movement tool for Postgres.\n\nBut that's my journey in databases and, like, very excited to be here and be hosting the databases track for Data Council.\n\nCraig: I love that the, like, the Unix philosophy of small sharp tools, right? Instead of being generalized, right, really focused on replication and solving it perfectly from one system to another.\n\nI love that. But, like, how did you even get into databases in the first place?\n\nSai: Yeah, that's a great question. So the way I got into Citus-- that was my first introduction to databases and Postgres, it was just by chance.\n\nI did not think of getting into databases. I t was my second job out of school.\n\nIt was just that one of my great, like, friends who was working there, so I thought it's okay and apply.\n\nCraig: So it was a completely, like, a happy accident or unhappy accident, which...\n\nSai: Absolutely happy accident, right? And I'm not leaving Postgres and databases since then.\n\nSo that's how I got into databases. And my passion for databases continues because I believe that, like, number one, databases are very critical and important to this world, right?\n\nEvery application on the internet requires a database. So that is number one. And number two is, as application needs evolve, right, like, database also needs to evolve, and the problems and challenges that it surfaces are going to get only harder. And that's where you need solutions, right? Like, and that's what, like, drives me to be so passionate about databases.\n\nCraig: Yeah, so I'd love... Like, I always say, like, working with databases, it took me personally a long time to get used to this that it's a very thankless job.\n\nIt's kind of, like, you don't show up to your bank and say thank you for not, like, losing my money or, like, thank you for, like, not having, like, my social security number stolen, right?\n\nLike, when you hear from your bank, it's like, \"Uh-oh, here's a year free of, like, free credit protection,\" right? Because there was a security breach.\n\nLike, it's really a thankless jobs 'cause you store the data, you do it well, and your customers don't talk to you, right?\n\nLike, it's critical, but it's a very thankless behind the scenes. Like, if you're doing your job well as a database, right, you kind of fade away into the background in what application developers build.\n\nSo it took me, personally, a long time to get to that. So in a minute, I want to get more into the track itself, but I'm kind of curious from your journey.\n\nBefore we get into that, any more, like, personal insights and experiences and kind of, you know, aha moments that you've had from your time in the data world.\n\nPhilosophy and Key Insights on Databases\n\nSai: I think I have, like, two insights that I wanted to share, right? Like, and maybe you'll agree with one of them, but, like, let's see.\n\nSo the first insight that I wanted to share is that across my decade of experience in databases, I believe that purpose built databases are more impactful than generalized databases.\n\nAnd this comes from my experience at Citus, right? Like, what we observed was we were, like, trying to do, like, multiple use cases, right, like, it'd be multi-tenant SaaS, like, which was more OLTP and transactional heavy, then you had, like, you know, real time analytics, right?\n\nSo what I felt was because of our focus on multiple use cases, we spread thin, right? Like, so sure Citus was a great success, right, but it did not become a Snowflake, right?\n\nCraig: I'm curious if this is the one I agree with or the other one because I mean, being a Postgres guy, right, like, Postgres can do a lot, but sorry, keep going.\n\nSai: Yeah, I think this is the one I'm not sure whether you'd agree with, but I am a strong believer of purpose built databases.\n\nAnd that's the reason probably I'm working for ClickHouse now and the acquisition went through because ClickHouse is laser-focused on, like, analytics, right?\n\nSo that is one of my, like, insights. The second insight, I'm sure you'll agree, is users buy databases not for just the technology and features, they buy databases for the team, the thought leadership, and the support, right?\n\nLike, I think, that is very, very important. And I would say that is equally important as the product and the features, right? So those are my two insights.\n\nCraig: Yeah, no, I think, like, you, imply this, that the roadmap, the direction, the vision, the ethos, like, what a database is and becoming, right?\n\nSo when you say to the team, right, where is it driving, where is it headed to, right? What's the vision, what's the direction? So yeah, I'm highly aligned to that.\n\nThe first one we might have to dispute a little bit as I think, like, personally, right, I am in the Postgres camp. I've been in that world for a long time and think it's an amazing database.\n\nAnd you know, I remember, the way, way back the Postgres gray-beards were, like, they remember when XML databases were going to take over the world.\n\nLike, legit this was a thing of XML databases were going to take over the world and Postgres just added an XML, you know, data type.\n\nIt went and added JSON, et cetera. So, you know, I'll get off my Postgres bandwagon. I do think there is something to very specialized, you know?\n\nI like the Unix tool philosophy, but I also see, you know, both expansion and compression within the data world.\n\nVision Behind the Databases Track\n\nShifting a little onto the track itself, 'cause when I saw the lineup, I was super excited.\n\nIt's like, you know, there's one track, but there's a lot going on in here. What was kind of your vision and goal with creating this track?\n\nSai: Yeah, so the team and vision of the databases track revolves around three main aspects.\n\nFirst is we wanted to capture most of the current and latest innovations that are happening in the space. That is number one. Number two is we wanted to bring a holistic view and a diverse perspective to the databases track, right? And that is reflected via other speakers and the talks.\n\nLike, and the database track is going to get started with, like, Andy Pavlo's talk, right? Like, and I feel that Andy Pavlo made databases cool, basically, right?\n\nCraig: Yeah, I mean, can we say, like, databases aren't supposed to be sexy. Like, is it fair... Like, sorry, they're not a sexy technology and yet Andy's done an amazing job of that.\n\nSo yeah, I mean, right there, you lead it off with kind of the pinnacle of now databases are cool again.\n\nSai: Absolutely, absolutely. And then we have, like, a bunch of talks, like, starting with, like, transactional workloads, right?\n\nLike, you have talks about Postgres and MongoDB. In the analytical side, you have talks about, like, InfluxDB, ClickHouse, DuckDB, and how the open data format and data lakes are affecting the data warehouse landscape.\n\nThere is a very interesting talk by Marco from Crunchy, you would know him a lot, on converging database architectures, right?\n\nWhere he talks about how they're extending Postgres for analytics by plugging in, like, DuckDB, right?\n\nThere is also, like, a talk by Etienne who is, like, the co-founder of Weaviate, which is a very famous vector database.\n\nAnd then this talk is about agentic databases, right, and how they are going to be the next big thing, right? Like, this is more related to AI, right?\n\nSo that is the second thing where we wanted to bring diverse and holistic perspectives to the track.\n\nLast, but not the least, this is something that is very personal to me, is we wanted to make it really customer-focused, right? Like, so that is reflected by the speakers, right?\n\nLike, most of the speakers are customer-focused, like, practitioners. If you see, like, Paul Dix from InfluxDB and InfluxDB has very large adoption in the community.\n\nIf you see, like, Tanya who is the head of product at ClickHouse and ClickHouse has, like, you know, thousands of, like, businesses using it, right?\n\nYou have, like, Frank from, like, MongoDB and Frank has, like, a implementations background, right?\n\nSo those are the three main, like, things. One is, like, capturing, like, current innovations in the database space.\n\nNext is bringing, like, holistic and diverse perspective to it. And the third is keeping it very grounded and, like, customer-focused, Craig.\n\nCraig: Yeah, no, I love how it's kind of weaved the mix of...\n\nOften you find academic conferences, you find, you know, industry conferences, you find, you know, vendor conferences and it's kind of a gorgeous mix between where you kind of run the gambit all in a single track.\n\nWhat Makes This Track (and Data Council) Unique\n\nBacking up, like, data conferences are out there. There's a lot of conferences, like, how is this unique from others?\n\nBecause I look at it and it jumps out to me. But I want to see, like, from your perspective as the track organizer, how is this unique from other data conferences out there that you've been to or attended or, you know, seen?\n\nHow is it different, 'cause to me it feels different looking at it. Like, as part of creating it, can you talk a little bit about that?\n\nSai: Yeah, that's a great question, right?\n\nSo the one thing what I've observed about, like, database conferences is that most of the database conferences are, like, tied to a technology, right?\n\nYou have, like, Postgres conferences, you have, like, MongoDB conferences, right?\n\nSo most of the times they are tied to a technology, but then the beauty of Data Council is it lets multiple database technologies talk about what is going on in their space, right?\n\nSo that is the theme also of the databases track where we, as I said, we wanted to keep it very diverse and bring in holistic views across these technologies. So that is one big difference, I would say, where it is not tied to a single technology, but it's more tied to what is going on in this space.\n\nSo that's the big difference.\n\nCraig: The entire conference looks super exciting to me. But I also have to say, I might just camp out in your tracks room the entire time.\n\nLike, are you sort of competing with, like, a... \" No, I want this room to be packed versus all the others.\"\n\nLike, are you camped in this room the entire time and you think it's the best room?\n\nCan you talk a little bit of, like, you know, the other spread of the talks and tracks at the conference?\n\nSai: Absolutely, there are a bunch of, like, tracks, right? Like, there is the data engineering track, which is what, like, Data Council is known for, right?\n\nI mean that's where it started from, right? Like, and this is the first time we added the databases track because this was a conversation with me and Pete last time.\n\nLike, I told him that, like, \"We should talk more about Postgres.\" I mean that's what I told because I'm a big Postgres fan.\n\nCraig: All right, you've won me back over. Keep going, keep going.\n\nSai: I am a Postgres fan. So I told him that we should talk more about Postgres because people want to learn about Postgres, which is where Pete, like, had this brilliant idea that we'll start the databases track, but then that you have the data engineering track, there is foundation models track, right?\n\nLike, there's an AI track, right? Like, so there are a bunch of tracks, and I think all of them are going to be, like, amazing, right?\n\nAnd if you look at the speakers, right? Like, in one of the tracks, we also have, like, you know, the creator of, like, DuckDB who's going to be speaking.\n\nCraig: Hannes, yeah.\n\nSai: Exactly, so I think all of the tracks are going to be fun, but I would say that, like, you know, the databases track probably would be the best because we have a legendary lineup, right?\n\nCraig: I'm really excited, I may stop out to catch Hannes' talk. I love Hannes' talks and what they're doing with DuckDB.\n\nSo there's a lot of, you know, data conferences out there. We've covered how your're different, and in particular, this track among databases, right, from academic to practitioner to, you know, interesting things happening and where the future is.\n\nAudience, Flow, and Accessibility\n\nCan you talk a little bit about the themes and kind of how this flows from one to the next? Because it seems like, it really does flow from a...\n\nYou can start your day in this track and end your day in it, and there's a lovely journey five-hour movie that happens, right?\n\nSai: Absolutely. I think the way I look at it, right, like, so far we spoke about, like, you know, the speakers and the talks, right?\n\nLike, getting into the audience, right, like, who would benefit from this track, right? Like, I did give, like, a thought for this.\n\nAnd I would say that I see three types of audiences benefit from this track.\n\nNumber one is basically database users who want to figure out, like, their data stack and you know, they learn about all the innovation that's going on from legendary experts, right?\n\nLike, and then through that, like, they fuel how their data stack is going to look like. So that is number one. The second type of audience I see is, like, database developers, right?\n\nLike, if you see two to three of the talks in the track are related to, like, database development, right? Like, these are, like, builders, like, who are giving talks.\n\nSo these database developers can learn how, you know, actual development is done where these are builders who are building large-scale databases, right, databases that are supporting thousands of customers.\n\nSo that is the second audience. The third is, it's also for students, right, like, who want to learn about databases, right?\n\nSo I see these three type of audiences, database users, database developers, and students, who would benefit from this track. What I expect is because of the diverse set of audience and the diverse set of speakers, there would be a lot of learning and great discussions. And that's the goal of the track.\n\nCraig: So if you don't want to accidentally stumble into databases, but be intentional about it, you jump right into this.\n\nLike, I agree as a student, right, like, you can go to a lot of academic, just the spread of academic to protect practitioner here is truly unique.\n\nNow, I guess shifting a little bit, was there anything, like, intimidating about creating this track, right?\n\nLike, to me there's a lovely cohesion, but is there any part where, like, \"Hey, I'm a Mongo person, this part's going to scare me.\"\n\nOr, like, should anyone be intimidated by, you know, \"Well, this talk isn't for me, that's talk's not for me.\"\n\nLike, if it's foreign to me, how should I hang out or think about it? Or do you have thoughts on that cohesion versus, you know, how you struggled with creating the track?\n\nSai: I think that's a great question. So firstly, like, I think it was a struggle to create that track.\n\nThe reason is, like, curating all the hundreds of talks and choosing just six of them was very difficult, right?\n\nLike, and we did it, like, more top to bottom, right? Like, where we decided, like, what's the vision of the track?\n\nAnd then, like, you know, we created these buckets of different topics and then we got the best speakers in each of them.\n\nSecond is, like, I don't think that, like, it's going to be a challenge for someone who is foreign to something, right?\n\nLike, for example, agentic databases are not my territory, right?\n\nLike, it's completely new for myself, but then I'm so excited about it because I'm expecting, like, all the speakers in the track would give context on, like, you know, each of their, like, territory, right?\n\nLike, I mean their topics. So I don't see it to be, like, you know, hard for, like, folks who are foreign to a topic because all of these are, like, super experienced speakers, right?\n\nAnd I'm sure that they would do a great job. So, yeah.\n\nCraig: So we've talked a lot about the track and the flow and the technology.\n\nMy favorite part of conferences is actually, usually the hallway track, right? And while I'm really excited to kind of camp myself in the track room and go from, like, Andy to time series to analytical, to transactional, like, just that whole flow, right?\n\nMy favorite part is usually the hallway track and connecting with people. Like, can you tell me a little bit of, like, the community you want to kind of want to bring together as part of that?\n\nSai: Yeah, so that's a great question.\n\nI would say that one important goal of the track from the hallway and from the audience perspective is to keep it full of questions and keep it very conversational in the sense that the audience can ask questions, let it be during the talk or let it be off their talk, right?\n\nLike, because finally, like, even though there is a legendary lineup, right, like, all of these speakers are just, like, people, right?\n\nLike, I'm sure that they will also be learning a lot, like, from, like, the questions, right? Like, so I think it's going to be very important to keep it very conversational and, like, keep it very questions heavy.\n\nAnd also not to forget, the audience can be the next speaker, right? So I would really recommend folks to submit talks.\n\nLike, this time, they were, like, hundreds of talks, right? Like, and it was so hard for, like, the...\n\nCraig: So you want your job to be harder next. You want more talks submitted next year and a harder job is what you're saying.\n\nSai: I agree, yes.\n\nCraig: No, I love it. No, I think it's spot on. Like, you know, having spoken at conferences, right, like, there's this aura about you, but, like, no, like, many people in the audience...\n\nI actually once gave a talk and in the back of the audience, and it was the most intimidating talk I ever gave, was Michael Stonebraker, the creator of Postgres.\n\nAnd I was giving a talk on Postgres, and there were questions that came up and I was just, like, sweating bullets. 'cause here's the man that created Postgres that's won a Turing award, right?\n\nAnd I'm giving a talk about Postgres, about the thing that he created and I had no idea. I just, the last minute, saw him walk in the back.\n\nAnd so your audience can be full of experts. And so I think, you know, a big takeaway is engage, right?\n\nLike, that's how you get so much out of it. Like, the speaker lineup, I've looked at it, it's amazing, but also, you know, you get out what you put into it.\n\nAnd so definitely go engage with the speakers, engage with the people around you. Yeah, it's super exciting.\n\nEmerging Trends and the Role of AI\n\nSo you've got to track about databases. There's a lot of emerging trends out there. Like, do we have to even say the word AI, right?\n\nLike, it's a incredibly hot topic. Where do databases fit in there, right? Like, are databases dead and boring?\n\nFirst year of the track, I'm super excited about it. Apparently I'm a weird nerd.\n\nYet what's the role of all the other things that we should be talking about? How does your track fit in with that?\n\nHow should we be thinking about broader trends and all of that, and when it comes to, you know, what's happening in the broader landscape?\n\nSai: Absolutely.\n\nI think we should talk about AI because that is the emerging trend, and I strongly believe that for AI to succeed, databases are going to be very critical.\n\nThe reason I say that, right, like, I mean, AI would actually lead to demanding workloads for which databases need to live up to, right?\n\nLike, so I'm expecting an orders of magnitude increase in requirements and demand for data.\n\nCraig: So an \"order of magnitude,\" are you thinking in terms of scale or user experience or both, like, 'cause I think, like, how people are working with things are different, right? So how does that impact databases?\n\nSai: Yeah, so orders of magnitude in respect to multiple things, right? Let it be performance, right?\n\nAI would need databases which are 10 times faster, let it be with respect to latency, throughput, and concurrency, right?\n\nThat is one, second is, like, databases need to handle orders of magnitude data, right?\n\nI mean, it's not going to be petabytes now, it's going to be zettabytes, right?\n\nSo that is number two, and number three, it's also going to be reliability, right?\n\nSo I see that in every dimension. Databases need to evolve to be able to support, like, AI, right?\n\nThat is the reason I think that AI cannot be successful without evolving databases. I think that's where the next set of innovation and companies, new companies probably will come up, where databases are being able to serve AI with these orders of magnitude, increase in demands and requirements.\n\nCraig: All right, so we've talked a whole bunch about your track. I'm excited for it. Yes, it's your favorite child.\n\nYou're not supposed to have a favorite child, but your track is your favorite child.\n\nBut, like, if there's a second favorite, like, is there another track or also, and or, something else that you're incredibly excited about, in regards to the Data Council conference.\n\nSai: So another track that I love is going to be the data engineering track, like, right?\n\nLike, this is probably because, like, PeerDB was a data replication tool, like, we moved data, right?\n\nLike, but that is one track, which is, like, the root of why Data Council, like... I mean that's, like, the...\n\nCraig: It's the origin, right? It's really the foundation.\n\nSai: Yeah, exactly.\n\nCraig: And, you know, you can't get away from that and it does it so well every year, right?\n\nSai: Exactly, right, so that track is going to be a good one to attend.\n\nAnd then there is a foundation models track as well, right, like, which goes into, like, AI, LLMs, and, like, you know, more, like, the guts of, like, LLMs, right?\n\nLike, I think that is going to be, like, a fun one, right? Very, like, engineering and, like, technical focus, I would say.\n\nAnd then there's also, like, a Lightning Talks track, right? It's going to be a lot of fun.\n\nSo last year, I gave a talk at, like, the Lightning Talks track and it was amazing. It was, like, 15 minutes of you know...\n\nThere was a talk about, like, Rust programming and, like, that impacting, like, databases, right? Like, and then I spoke about, like, you know, data movement, right?\n\nLike, so it's, like, very, like, interesting, like, you know, quick bits across, like, the entire data space, right? Like, so I think...\n\nCraig: I always highly recommend the lightning, I remember actually at PyCon years ago when Docker was first...\n\nLike, Docker was first unveiled at a lightning talk at PyCon, and it's, you know, like, no spoilers, I don't know what's coming in the lightning talks.\n\nBut you never know, it's rapid fire, and the ability to convey a message in that time and you see so much so quickly that it's always a, you know, kind of a must see.\n\nLike, any other kind of pieces or nugget, so the lightning talks, the data engineering track, the foundational model ones, like, any other kind of highlights of the conference?\n\nSai: Another thing that I would like to note is there are these hands-on sessions where there are speaker office hours, where audience can go and interact with speakers right away, and these office hours are right after the speaker gives the talk, right?\n\nLike, so you can actually go spend time with the speaker, like, have a discussion, right?\n\nSo that is something that is very unique I saw in the Data Council conference where you get a chance to personally meet the speaker, have a discussion, right, like, and learn both ways, right?\n\nSo that is something that I'm very excited about as well.\n\nCraig: Yeah, that's really, like, I... You know, usually, there's a swarm after a speaker, you know, talks and, like, it feels intimidating to go up there and you know, just even say hi or ask a question.\n\nLike, the ability to kind of break out in a smaller format with them, that's actually...\n\nI don't know if any other conference I can recall that's done that and that's actually really unique and actually probably takes some of the pressure off as a newbie attending a conference to go up and talk to these speakers.\n\nSai: Absolutely, and I think it also eases some pressure on the speaker as well because they can really hang out and talk to folks and they learn, right?\n\nLike, because last time, I was a part of this and it was a lot of fun because, like, the talk was for 15 minutes, right, but then the hands-on, office hours went on for, like, 45 minutes, where we had so many amazing discussions.\n\nCraig: Cool, well, I just want to say, you know, thanks so much for sitting down, Sai.\n\nI'm super excited when you sent over kind of the rundown of the track. I was excited, I'm going to be there. You're going to be there.\n\nCome up to us, say hi. If you're at Data Council, we'd love to see you. I'd love that databases are kind of becoming sexy again, right?\n\nThanks a lot to Andy Pavlo who's going to kind of kick things off for the day, you know, in the track, and then it's going to be a whirlwind tour.\n\nIt's kind of like this databases courses, all compressed in one day, one amazing track, a lot of speakers, so I'm really excited about it.\n\nLook forward to kind of seeing folks there. I'll be there if anyone wants to talk Postgres.\n\nSai will be there if anyone wants to talk ClickHouse and you know, databases broadly.\n\nWe'll geek out with anyone on it. Sai, anything, you know, that you want to leave to folks?\n\nSai: No, that's it, very excited for the conference, right?\n\nWe started effort around six to seven months ago and the place where we are at now, right, like, with the kind of speakers.\n\nThe venue is also going to be amazing, right? Like, I mean I was speaking to Pete and he was saying that, like, it's going to be in Oakland and it's a very raw island, like, a very...\n\nYou know, it's an amazing venue so you should check that out, right? Like, so I'm sure that it's going to be a lot of fun and as Craig mentioned, right, just reach out to us, right?\n\nWe'd would love to have some great conversations, and very excited to see you there.",
