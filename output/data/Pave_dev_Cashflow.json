      "# [Consumer Cashflow – The data’s there, but the infrastructure isn’t. by Ema Rouf on 2022-02-25](https://pave.dev/blog/what-is-consumer-cashflow/)\nImagine that you’re running a restaurant. It’s busy – there are different customers every week! But, you’ve got a good handle on your operating costs including rent, utilities, payroll, and insurance. You’re also aware of the inflows from food and beverage sales. Cashflow is well understood, standardized, and documented for businesses like these.\n\nBut what does cashflow mean for a person?\n\nFor an individual, it’s a lot murkier. Some basic questions:\n\nDoes a secondary part-time consulting job that gets deposited via Zelle count as income?\n\nIs pet insurance an essential expenditure?\n\nHow many expenses are regular or expected like utility bills vs. one-time expenses like an emergency doctor’s visit?\n\nAll of this context is buried across many different systems and thousands of row-level metadata that’s usually very messy, fragmented across different accounts, and hard to analyze.\n\nThe data’s there, but the infrastructure isn’t.\n\nLet’s take a look at a specific example of how analyzing the cashflow of an individual comes into play.\n\nMeet Maya, a 40-year-old Registered Nurse living in St. Louis, Missouri. Her primary checking and savings account is with Wells Fargo.\n\nAs a nurse, Maya’s work hours are in flux – some weeks she gets some additional shifts. She gets a direct deposit from her employer every two weeks, but the amount fluctuates. Banks and other lenders can see “flexible” schedules as “unstable” when performing a risk assessment on a mortgage or other type of loan, leaving Maya with few options to get access to credit when she needs it.\n\nAs a consequence, she isn’t being offered the best financial services to meet her needs.\n\nThis was the impetus for her to explore fintech solutions that take into account the context around her personal cashflow and financial profile. In the example below, we can see that her data is sitting across many different systems that each hold unique information about her financial situation.\n\nThe fintech apps she uses are a part of her daily livelihood.\n\nMaya maintains her primary checking and savings accounts at Wells Fargo, but finds it difficult to keep track of her income and expenses on a daily basis.\n\nMaya was swimming in credit card debt after an emergency car repair set her back on her payments. Her friend pointed her to Plannery, a credit app specifically designed for nurses and physicians. Plannery understands that a nurse’s job security is almost guaranteed due to the nursing shortage, and is able to offer nurses a debt consolidation option that is uniquely catered to nurses.\n\nMaya uses a digital bank called Lume which is also designed for nurses and offers special discounts and early payments.\n\nShe manages her student loan payments on Lume via Payitoff, which also helps her see if she qualifies for reduced payments.\n\nMaya connected her bank data via Plaid and Ocrolus to Monarch Money, a personal financial management app that helps her track her spending, savings and investments.\n\nThe above is still only a fraction of the complexity of Maya’s financial life.\n\nWhy this matters\n\nSo why is there so much value in being able to get a complete picture of Maya’s financial profile?\n\nConsumers today expect instant wages, transfers, liquidity, and credit decisions.\n\nLike many consumers, Maya expects speed, convenience, and personalized offers for financial services when she needs them. She’s among the 60% of U.S. workers who want to get early access to their paychecks. She expects that apps will use the information she’s trusted them with to provide personalized and instant financial services like a financial plan optimized for her situation, loan offers, and help with managing her spending between paychecks.\n\nAll of these expectations require each fintech app she’s using to have a detailed understanding of Maya’s financial life.\n\nThe cost of acquisition for financial services is high\n\nAcquisition costs are one of the biggest challenges for any lender. Today, companies spend millions of dollars buying targeted lists from the bureaus in order to identify people with an inclination to take on new credit. In 2020, fintechs in North America spent $985 million to acquire new customers.\n\nMeanwhile, these companies are sitting on treasure troves of financial data that may contain signals around their customer’s willingness and ability to pay. However, they struggle to leverage this data due to difficulties in data cleaning and analysis in order to generate customers’ insights.\n\nA growing number of consumers are underserved by FICO and traditional sources\n\nThe demographics of our country are changing. We have a growing immigrant population, and more people have multiple sources of income fueled by the creator and gig economy. In fact, 36% of the total U.S. workforce does freelance work. Minority groups as well as younger generations have inherent distrust in the traditional credit system. To put this into perspective, 57 million Americans are living with subprime credit. These consumers are left out, and a rapidly emerging fintech ecosystem is reinventing how new products are designed for underserved consumers.\n\nConsumers are using more financial services\n\nAs more fintech players are joining the playing field, consumers are subscribing to more services to help them manage their financial lives. However, juggling multiple accounts can become burdensome. Late payments and overdrafts are just some of the factors that hurt consumers as a result of managing multiple accounts. Losing track of a bill due date was the reason behind 66% of BNPL users who had a late payment. As for overdrafts, half of Millennials with more than one checking account overdrew in 2020.\n\nBottom Line\n\nSolving the issue of understanding the complete picture of a person’s financial profile benefits both a financial service provider, as well as the end user. When a fintech company or bank can better understand a user’s financial profile, they can reduce their risk, approve and onboard more customers, as well as offer additional financial services to existing customers.\n\nWith a more comprehensive view of the customer, fintechs can help individuals understand their own financial profile, like how likely they are to default and when, and what specific actions they can take to improve their financial health.\n\nHow does Pave solve this?\n\nFor every company building a financial service, it’s a major effort to get a complete and accurate understanding of their customers’ financial lives. For the past 25 years, FICO has created and standardized scores built on credit bureau data. Today, the massive increase in data sources calls for the development of new infrastructure and standards for evaluating an individual’s cashflow and financial profile.\n\nRather than reinvent the wheel, Pave is building a solution to standardize how everyone views the cashflow and financial profile of a consumer.\n\nWe’re making it possible for developers and data scientists to connect all of their disparate data sources to Pave and get back a unified view of the end consumer’s financial life in order to provide increased access to credit and personalized financial journeys.\n\nCheck out our use cases for:\n\nCash Advance\n\nOverdraft Protection\n\nCredit Builder\n\nACH Risk\n\nBill Tracking",
      "# [Visualize recurring expenditures using pave.dev by Lennon Chimbumu on 2021-08-02](https://pave.dev/blog/visualize-recurring-expenditures-using-pave-dev/)\nWith pave.dev, building feature rich customer experiences can be as easy as making a simple API call. This post will show you how quick and easy it is to build a recurring expenditures dashboard using our Cashflow API.\n\nGithub Repo: https://github.com/Pave-Financial/pave-examples\n\nPreview\n\nAssumptions\n\nWe’ll be making the following assumptions in this post:\n\nYou already have access to the pave.dev cashflow API.\n\nYou have already uploaded some sample data to pave.dev.\n\nIf either of these assumptions does not hold for you, please contact us at api@pave.dev\n\nTechnologies Used\n\nRedux – Redux makes it easy to have a predictable application state.\n\nReact – Any modern frontend JavaScript will do. We’ll be using React bootstrapped with the create-react-app tool\n\nHere’s what we’ll cover in this post:\n\nBasic Setup\n\nImplementing the HTTP API\n\nCreating visualizations with the recurring expenditures data.\n\nStep 1: Setting up\n\nYou’ll need to make sure that you have the Node.js version 14 or greater installed on your development environment. Our example source code ships with a .devcontainer folder that takes advantage of the VS Code Remote Containers feature. This folder contains a portable development environment that contains all the prerequisites for running the development environment. You can find documentation on how to set this up on VS Code’s official documentation.\n\nStep 2: Implement our HTTP API\n\nWe are including the basic implementation of the API here but we’ll be skipping over the minutiae of the Redux implementation.\n\nIf you’re interested in the implementation of the Redux stores and reducers, you can refer to our Github repository. You may find the following files to be useful:\n\nCreating the API Reducer\n\nCombining Reducers\n\nSetting up the redux store\n\nThe following code uses the fetch API and Redux actions to invoke the recurring expenditures API.\n\nimport fetch from 'isomorphic-fetch' const { REACT_APP_API_KEY, REACT_APP_API_ENDPOINT } = process.env; function requestExpendituresActions() { return { type: FETCH_RECURRING_EXPENSES } } function receiveExpendituresActions(json) { return { type: RECEIVE_RECURRING_EXPENSES, data: json, receivedAt: new Date() } } export function fetchRecurringExpenditures(userId) { const url = `${REACT_APP_API_ENDPOINT}/users/${userId}/recurring_expenditures`; return function(dispatch) { dispatch(requestExpendituresActions()) const options = { method: 'GET', headers: {'x-api-key': YOUR_API_KEY} } fetch(url, options) .then((res) =&gt; res.json()) .then((json) =&gt; { dispatch(receiveExpendituresActions(json)) }) .catch((err) =&gt; { console.error(err); // eslint-disable-line }); } }\n\nIf everything goes well, your API response should resemble the following output.\n\n{ \"user_id\": \"user_123\", \"from\": \"2017-07-31\", \"to\": \"2019-08-01\", \"recurring_expenditures\": [ { \"type\": \"Utility\", \"normalized_merchant_name\": \"Comcast\", \"merchant_uuid\": \"MERCHANT_ID\",, \"logo\": \"https://assets.pave.dev/merchants/logos/0002e1ce-e901-4715-bd9a-xxxxxxxxxxxx.png\", \"last_amount\": 184.78, \"last_description\": \"Comcast\", \"last_date\": \"2019-07-30\", \"avg_amount\": 181.23, \"iso_currency_code\": \"USD\", \"count\": 24, \"avg_period_days\": 30.7, \"normalized_frequency\": \"monthly\", \"previous_amount\": 184.78, \"previous_date\": \"2019-07-01\", \"delta_amount\": 0.0, \"delta_percent\": 0.0 }, ... ] }\n\nStep 3: Create a Pie Chart\n\nAt this point, you should be able to consume the data in the display components. You can find the full implementations for all the charts and tables in our github repository. The code that displays the Pie Chart is located in src/pages/charts/ApexCharts. Our example uses ApexCharts, but you can use any chart library of your choosing.\n\nNow that we have everything set up, let’s create our pie chart to visualize recurring expenditures by merchants.\n\n// src/pages/charts/ApexCharts/Column.js /** * This Component renders spending by category */ import React from \"react\"; import Chart from \"react-apexcharts\"; import { connect } from \"react-redux\"; import {map, groupBy} from 'lodash'; import numeral from 'numeral' const ColumnChart = ({ theme, recurringExpenditures }) =&gt; { // Group the data by transaction type const groupedData = groupBy(recurringExpenditures, (elem) =&gt; elem.type); const sourceData = groupedData ? groupedData : [] // Sum up all the transactions for a specific type const data = map(sourceData, (expenditures, type) =&gt; { return { name: type, data: [expenditures.reduce((accumulator, current) =&gt; accumulator + (current.last_amount || 0), 0)] } }) const options = { plotOptions: { bar: { horizontal: false, columnWidth: \"25%\", borderRadius: 8, } }, chart: { type: 'bar', stacked: true, toolbar: { show: true }, }, dataLabels: { enabled: false }, xaxis: { categories: [ \"Spending By Category\", ] }, yaxis: { title: { text: \"$\" }, labels: { formatter: function (value) { return numeral(value).format('$0,0.00a'); } } } }; // Render the chart return ( &lt;div className=\"chart\"&gt; &lt;Chart options={options} series={data} type=\"bar\" height=\"350\" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; ); }; export default connect(store =&gt; ({ theme: store.theme.currentTheme }))(ColumnChart);\n\nYour chart should look something like this:",
      "# [Announcing the new SMB Cashflow API by Amelia Chikota on 2024-05-10](https://pave.dev/blog/announcing-the-new-smb-cashflow-api/)\nExpanding our focus to SMB markets addresses a critical gap: small businesses are often significantly underserved by traditional financial institutions. Fintech innovations, particularly those aimed at SMBs, are now driving the market by offering solutions like payments, lending, and commerce enablement tailored to their unique needs (Alex Johnson has a great breakdown here).\n\nA staggering 80% of SMBs rely on P2P loans, driven by a void in traditional banking services that fail to recognize their creditworthiness due to a lack of conventional credit data. This gap is where nonbank lenders are stepping in, using cashflow underwriting to broaden access for these underserved businesses. Companies like Square are offering more accessible loans to SMBs that large banks typically overlook, especially for minority and women-owned businesses.\n\nOur SMB Cashflow API supports this shift, enhancing risk assessment and fostering inclusivity by expanding access to credit for SMBs. Lenders leveraging cashflow analytics through partners like Pave allows them to effectively to personalize financial solutions based on a business’ cashflows. It’s not just about offering loans; it’s about empowering SMBs to manage their finances proactively, and SMB lenders to better understand their borrowers through detailed, real-time financial insights.",
      "# [Announcing the new Cash Advance Score by Amelia Chikota on 2024-02-16](https://pave.dev/blog/announcing-the-new-cash-advance-score/)\nWe’re thrilled to introduce our new Cash Advance Score. This new Score offers a risk assessment of a user’s ability to repay specific cash advance amounts.\n\nThe Cash Advance Score is trained on millions of cash advances and hundreds of Attributes such as overdraft fees, changes in income, balance trends, and more.\n\nIntroduce Higher Advance Amounts\n\nThe new Score minimizes the risk associated with introducing higher advance amounts by removing the guesswork on how your users would repay these advances. Instead, you can use a high Cash Advance Score threshold for approval, and gradually lower this as you observe the repayment rate.\n\nReduce Cash Advance Defaults\n\nReject poor-scoring users who would have otherwise been approved.\n\nIncrease Approvals\n\nApprove high-scoring users who would have otherwise been denied.\n\nMinimize Portfolio Risk\n\nThe new Score allows you to minimize the overall risk in your portfolio by giving higher advance amounts to the least risky users, and lower amounts (or denying advances) to the riskiest users.\n\nYou can get started with our new Score here: https://docs.pave.dev/scores/get-cash-advance-score\n\nRead more about our Cash Advance use case here.\n\nThe Cash Advance Score predicts the likelihood of repayment within 30 days. However, higher Scores are also correlated with shorter repayment periods. For example, for 80% chance of repayment, a user may need a score of:\n\n981 for 7 days repayment\n\n767 for 15 days repayment\n\n657 for 30 days repayment\n\n580 for 45 days repayment\n\nThus, if you want to optimize repayments for periods shorter than 30 days, you can increase the minimum Score threshold. Inversely, you can decrease this threshold if you want to optimize repayments for periods longer than 30 days.",
      "# [Upload Plaid Auth Payloads to Pave by Amelia Chikota on 2023-02-17](https://pave.dev/blog/upload-plaid-auth-payloads-to-pave/)\nWe’re now ingesting Plaid Auth data! Plaid Auth payloads provide information about a user’s account, including the financial institution associated with the account.\n\nThe specific financial institution can impact the frequency and accuracy of balance updates, the amount of an NSF or Overdraft fee, the duration of a transfer, and more. Pave will unify the financial institution and account information with the user’s transactions for more accurate balances and credit risk models.",
      "# [Time Data Matters in Lending by Amelia Chikota on 2024-05-02](https://pave.dev/blog/why-real-time-data-matters-in-lending/)\nFor example, a 720 FICO used to signal a certain level of creditworthiness pre-COVID, but the same score today doesn’t mean what it used to. Model drift challenges the reliability of traditional risk models, making it harder for lenders to discern who might default from those likely to repay reliably.\n\nThe Fed’s research on this shows that average FICO scores are at a record high, even though delinquency rates for auto loans reached their peak since 2000, and credit card delinquencies increased significantly after 2021.\n\nThis drives the need for lenders to detect financial strain early—way before these changes surface in a FICO score and lead to defaults in the loan book.\n\nWhile FICO maintains that their scores have adapted to reflect current economic conditions accurately and continue to be robust indicators of credit risk, their scores don’t adjust in real-time. Relying on solely FICO can lead lenders to make decisions based on old data – often up to 60 days delayed.\n\nLenders lack live monitoring tools and instead rely on infrequent, ad hoc efforts. This results in a significant gap in continuous, real-time monitoring of model performance and borrower financial health. Such tools are essential not only for forecasting loan performance but also for valuing these assets when selling as securities. The common methods used today are:\n\nManual Reviews and Audits: Periodic, sample-based reviews of loan files to assess compliance and credit risk, and any significant changes\n\nSpreadsheet Tracking: Use of manual spreadsheets to monitor loan performance, prone to errors and not scalable.\n\nConsulting Experts: Occasional consultations with external financial analysts or credit experts for advice on complex cases.\n\nThese methods highlight the lack of continuous, real-time data analysis in traditional lending practices, underscoring the need for more advanced and real-time monitoring tools.\n\nLenders expect the inflation of FICO scores to continue for a while (and they have to adjust for it).\n\nThis doesn’t mean that FICO will be replaced, instead, it means 3 things:\n\nLenders have an appetite for more real-time insight into performance. On the SMB side, it’s been known that credit score is not indicative of creditworthiness, hence the appetite for cashflow analytics\n\nFICO is less important in lender’s models but still the standard for securitization. There’s a good post on this by Alex Johnson: https://workweek.com/2024/01/12/fico-score/\n\nAn ecosystem of tools is emerging to help lenders react faster: https://workweek.com/2024/03/20/credit-decisioning-os/\n\nAs lenders adapt to a landscape where FICO scores may no longer fully reflect borrower risk, the shift towards more agile, real-time analytics tools is becoming crucial. This shift is supported by innovative solutions from companies like Pave and Method, which enhance lenders’ capabilities to assess and manage credit risk effectively in real-time.",
      "# [Announcing the new Small Dollar Loan Score by Amelia Chikota on 2024-05-17](https://pave.dev/blog/announcing-the-new-small-dollar-loan-score/)\nThe Small Dollar Loan Score evaluates the probability of a user making their first four small dollar loan payments. It provides a series of four probability scores, one for each of the initial four installments.\n\nSmall dollar loans, typically capped at $5,000, are unsecured, short-term installment loans. Repayments are structured in installments for up to two years. They provide quick financial relief to borrowers who may not have access to other sources of credit (e.g., high credit card limits or larger and longer term personal loans).\n\nThe Small Dollar Loan Score is a predictive machine-learning model that leverages Cashflow Attributes calculated from the user’s real-time transaction history and balance data, updated with each new data upload.\n\nThis won’t always be the case. There are 4 separate models trained to predict the first 4 installments. This means in some cases, a user may end up with higher probabilities for later payments. However, we’ll analyze this and put in place mitigating factors. For example, passing the probabilities of payments for the previous installments to the model."

      "# [Pave.dev and Taktile Partner to Automate SMB Credit Underwriting by Amelia Chikota on 2024-08-01](https://pave.dev/blog/pave-dev-and-taktile-partner-to-automate-smb-credit-underwriting/)\nA particular area of focus for the Pave.dev and Taktile partnership is addressing the needs of underserved small businesses. Our collaboration aims to bridge the gap for the vastly underserved SMB sector by providing increased access to advanced cashflow analytics and the tools to effectively incorporate them into credit models.\n\nThis quarter, Pave launched a new suite of cashflow products allowing SMB lenders to validate cashflows, underwrite, and assign credit limits using real-time cashflow analytics.\n\nAs Ema Rouf, co-founder of Pave.dev, explains, “Taktile’s innovative solutions and focus areas align perfectly with our mission to provide superior cashflow analytics for business lenders.”\n\nMaik Taro Wehmeyer, Co-Founder & CEO at Taktile, shares his enthusiasm about the collaboration: “Pave.dev’s cashflow analytics combined with Taktile’s credit decisioning capabilities create a powerful synergy. Together, we can provide lenders with the tools they need to reduce manual processing work and increase their decision performance.”\n\nFrom the beginning, Taktile has supported the credit underwriting use case, establishing itself as a leader in the space. Taktile emphasizes making it as easy as possible to automate & optimize decision workflows and credit policies in a highly robust and low-latency manner.\n\nPave.dev’s Cashflow-driven Attributes and Scores are directly accessed within Taktile’s decision engine to enable non-technical teams to build complex decision workflows. From this collaboration, lenders get comprehensive cashflow analytics enabling more inclusive and efficient risk decisions.\n\nThe collaboration between Pave.dev and Taktile offers several key benefits:\n\nReduced Manual Processing: With its extensive experience in credit underwriting, Taktile allows lenders to streamline workflows in a highly robust and low-latency manner.\n\nAdvanced Underwriting Capabilities: By integrating Pave.dev’s cashflow analytics, lenders can better assess the financial health of businesses, leading to more accurate credit underwriting and risk management.\n\nSimple Yet Powerful Workflows: Taktile’s decision engine enables non-technical teams to create, execute, and refine automated decisions without engineering support, empowering them to own underwriting operations end-to-end.\n\nSeamless Data Integration: The partnership facilitates the seamless integration of various data sources, including bank transactions, credit reports, and more, into a unified analytical platform.\n\nPave.dev’s Cashflow-driven Attributes and Scores, which assess the likelihood of a borrower repaying a loan based on their cashflow data, can be easily integrated into Taktile’s decision engine to enhance risk assessment capabilities.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nData Ingestion: Pave.dev ingests and processes bank transactions and credit reports uploaded by Taktile or the lender.\n\nNear Real-Time Analytics Generation: Pave generates Cashflow-Driven Attributes and Scores in near real-time using this data.\n\nIntegration: Attributes and scores are made available via Taktile’s decision engine.\n\nDecisioning: Lenders leverage Pave’s Attributes and Scores within Taktile’s intuitive interface.\n\nBy incorporating real-time Cashflow Analytics into their decisioning processes via the Taktile/Pave integration, lenders can make more accurate credit decisions, all while freeing up resources and making operations more efficient.\n\nTaktile and Pave both service consumer and business lenders, but are honing in on SMB lenders in the context of this partnership. Addressing the needs of underserved businesses is a huge opportunity that both parties are eager to address with the synergies of the partnership.\n\nIn partnership, Pave and Taktile will work with innovative SMB lenders and financial institutions looking to adopt cashflow analytics to increase access to underserved businesses.\n\nAs Ema Rouf notes, “Our strategy will focus on SMB lenders who are eager to adopt advanced analytics for better financial insights. This collaboration with Taktile will help us deliver even greater value to our customers.”",
      "# [Taktile’s Plaid integration empowers lenders to unlock new growth opportunities on 2024-04-23](https://www.taktile.com/articles/taktile-s-plaid-integration-to-unlock-new-growth-opportunities-for-lenders)\nOpen banking data has been a game-changer for the lending industry, empowering lenders to build next-generation credit products that serve more customers than ever before.\n\nThis transformative data source significantly increases lenders’ data coverage, providing valuable insights into their customers' financial well-being. Lenders can develop highly precise underwriting signals, which unlock opportunities to reach new customer segments and explore growth areas.\n\nWhen paired with modern risk decisioning technology, which enables lenders to rapidly build and refine underwriting decisions, the potential for bringing innovative credit products to market becomes limitless.\n\nThis powerful combination of cutting-edge decisioning technology and open banking data is why Taktile decided to partner with Plaid. Taktile’s Plaid integration provides lenders with a comprehensive solution to harness open banking data across the entire lifecycle of the underwriting process.\n\nPlaid, a global open banking provider and data network, has been leading the charge of global open banking adoption since day one. It has helped thousands of fintechs innovate beyond traditional credit scoring techniques and build market-leading credit underwriting strategies.\n\nAt the same time, Taktile, the next-generation decision engine provider, is helping fintechs worldwide achieve unprecedented growth by enabling credit and risk teams to rapidly build, run, and optimize automated underwriting decisions without the help of technical engineers.\n\nImportantly, Taktile equips fintechs with the ability to seamlessly integrate data into their underwriting process and create powerful signals for assessing customer risk – from connecting to internal customer databases to enriching heuristics through Taktile's Marketplace of market-leading data providers like Plaid.\n\n“This partnership isn’t just about transforming the underwriting process —it's about helping lenders really unlock the power of cash flow data,” explains Maik Taro Wehmeyer, CEO and Co-Founder of Taktile. “By leveraging Plaid’s data insights through Taktile’s decision engine, lenders can build highly personalized credit solutions and get them to market at record speed.”\n\n1. Unlock new lending opportunities and grow customer approvals\n\nAccording to a recent Plaid survey, 63% of consumers feel that their credit score fails to provide lenders with a comprehensive understanding of their financial capabilities to repay a loan.\n\nThis implies that traditional credit scoring methods likely impact lending decisions for a significant portion of the consumer population – especially for applicants with limited or absent credit histories, such as immigrants, freelancers, and younger demographics.\n\nBy elevating risk assessment capabilities through cash flow data, lenders can not only grow customer approvals but also tap into unexplored customer segments to grow their customer base.\n\nConsider a medical professional who has just moved to the United States. They are probably a great candidate for any lender’s loan portfolio, but because they have no credit history in the US, many lenders would reject them because they cannot accurately assess their risk.\n\nUsing Plaid data, lenders can create a 360-degree view of customer risk profiles through detailed information about a borrower’s identity, assets, balances, and up to two years of transaction history directly from their bank account.\n\n2. Speed up time-to-market with a one-click integration\n\nBuilding automated underwriting decisions that include connections to crucial data sources is often a painful and resource-intensive process, requiring implementation by technical engineers over several months.\n\nA recent Taktile survey revealed that the vast majority of lenders (75%) still need to enable their credit teams to self-serve when it comes to adding and experimenting with new data sources in their automated decisions.\n\nPlaid and Taktile offer lenders an all-in-one solution. By connecting to Plaid through Taktile’s Decision Engine, lenders can access consumer cash flow data with the click of a button. Then, they can rapidly build powerful automated underwriting decisions through pre-built low-code “nodes”.\n\nAs a result, fintechs can significantly expedite the product launch process. Timelines are reduced from months to weeks, saving valuable time and resources.\n\n3. Create powerful KPIs that quickly uncover your optimal underwriting strategy\n\nGetting a connection to open banking data is merely the first step. The true competitive edge for lenders comes from the ability to build powerful signals from the data and undertake rapid policy optimization.\n\nDiscovering the right signals for your product, segment, and risk appetite when using cash flow data can be tricky. That is why Plaid equips lenders with both raw data and pre-established 'signals' or key performance indicators (KPIs) about customer financial behavior – to help them more quickly find their optimal strategy.\n\nFrom an infrastructure perspective, speed wins. Taktile found that lenders who experiment with and implement policy changes the fastest tend to be the closest to achieving their performance goals.\n\nLeveraging Taktile’s experimentation capabilities, credit and risk experts are empowered to quickly and easily refine their policies through shadow, A/B, and back-testing, enabling them to reach their optimal underwriting strategy faster.\n\n“Whether it's faster approval times, more competitive interest rates, or customized repayment options, we want to help lenders deliver exceptional customer experiences that foster loyalty and trust and drive long-term profitability,” says Maik.\n\nFurthermore, using Taktile, lenders can more effectively manage customer acquisition costs by designing segmented credit decision flows that follow a “waterfall” approach. This ensures they only incur data costs for the right parts of their customer segment at the right stage of the credit decision process.\n\nBy streamlining the development and implementation process, Plaid and Taktile empower lenders to capitalize on new opportunities quickly, ensuring they can stay ahead of the curve by offering innovative credit products and services that meet the evolving needs of consumers.",

(For this reason we also especially love hiring past and future founders.)\n\nWe're currently hiring full-stack engineers for our ML and web platform teams, a web developer to bridge our product and marketing teams, several technical roles on the sales & field engineering teams, and our first applied machine learning researcher to help push forward the state of the art in computer vision.\n\n[1]: https://roboflow.com/?ref=whoishiring1024\n\n[2]: https://roboflow.com/universe?ref=whoishiring1024\n\n[3]: https://github.com/autodistill/autodistill\n\n[4]: https://github.com/roboflow/supervision\n\n[5]: https://blog.roboflow.com/?ref=whoishiring1024\n\n[6]: https://www.youtube.com/@Roboflow\n\nMixRank (YC S11) | Software Engineers | 100% REMOTE (Global) | Full-Time\n\nMixRank processes petabytes of data every month from web crawling. We have hundreds of customers using our data products including Google, Amazon, Facebook, Intel, and Adobe, across industries including Finance, Recruiting, Sales, Marketing, and Security.\n\nWe’re a fully-remote company with a global footprint in over 20 countries. We're growing, profitable, employee-owned, no dependence on outside funding. Applicants from all geographies and backgrounds are welcome.\n\nWe are looking for passionate individuals for whom programming is not just a job but it’s something they love to do. We're obsessed with computers, programming, big data, databases, compilers, hardware, math, data science, and the internet. Does this sound like you? Please apply to join our team.\n\nOur code base is very friendly to new contributors. You'll have a fully-functional development environment within hours (fully automated) and be pushing commits on your first day. Deployments to production happen multiple times per day and finish in less than 2 minutes. Effectively all of our codebase is written in Python, Rust, SQL, Javascript/TypeScript, and Nix. The core technologies you'll need familiarity with to be productive are Python, PostgreSQL, Linux, and Git.\n\nWe operate at a larger scale than typical startups. We operate two datacenters with high performance servers we've built that are capable of dealing with the volumes of data we process. We've implemented our own distributed file system. We do full-scale web crawls. We download and perform static analysis on the entire universe of Android APKs and iOS IPAs that are published. Unlike a typical startup where you'll spend half of your time in meetings, and the other half fixing bugs from Jira tickets— at MixRank you'll get to challenge yourself with difficult technical problems that will help you to grow as an individual.\n\nWe're hiring continuously for the positions below— they aren't singular positions that will close once filled. Our philosophy on hiring is that the candidate is more important than the position. For each new member of the team, we design a custom role and responsibilities that are specialized to their interests. Other companies will come up with a long list of specific requirements for a position with the expectation that you'll exactly replace someone from the team, or that you'll be the perfect tetris piece that satisfies the job requirements decided by a committee. MixRank is more pragmatic: we'll first get excited about having a unique individual on the team, then we'll figure out the best way to accommodate their specific talents.\n\n--\n\nJunior Software Engineer - Remote (Global), Full-Time\n\nWe're looking for remote junior engineers that have 0-3 years of professional experience in software, and 5+ years of curiosity exploring computers, programming, and technical hobby projects. This is an open-ended entry role with mentorship and diverse opportunities to work on all areas of our product: databases, distributed systems, infrastructure and tooling, data analysis, machine learning, frontend/backend web development, APIs, data mining, data modeling, and more. To stand out, please highlight what makes you unique: passion for computing, curiosity and side projects, work ethic, niche research, etc.\n\nIdeally you've already graduated, but if you still have one or more years left of school, please feel free to apply anyway, and if you're the right fit for the team we'll figure out a way to accommodate your schedule.\n\n--\n\nSoftware Engineer - Remote (Global), Full-Time\n\nWe're hiring generalist software engineers to work on web applications, data mining, machine learning/data science, data transformation/ETL, data modeling, database scaling, infrastructure, devops, and more. We'll cater the role to whatever subset of these areas match your interests.\n\nBeneficial experience includes PostgreSQL, Python, Rust, Linux, TypeScript, Nix, frontend/backend web development, and data mining.\n\n--\n\nEx-Founders (all roles) - Remote (Global), Full-Time\n\nWe encourage founders in software engineering, sales, marketing, customer success, design, and product to reach out. If you don't see a relevant position open, reach out to jobs at mixrank.com. We care more about the person than the job position, and we're happy to craft the perfect position for anyone that joins our team. People with founder experience tend to be very successful at MixRank, and our leadership team is filled with founders.\n\n--\n\nI'm Scott, Founder/CEO/CTO. Please apply here: https://app.dover.com/jobs/mixrank\n\nThesis* | Engineering Hires | Remote\n\nThesis is a cryptocurrency venture studio whose mission is to empower the individual—we seek, fund, and build products using cryptocurrency and decentralized technology that further this mission. Current and past Thesis projects include Fold (2014), tBTC (2020), Taho (2021), Etcher (2023), Embody (2023), and Thesis Defense (2024). Investors in the company include Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital, and Draper Associates, among others. We are a remote-first company, led by founders who have been operating in the cryptocurrency and web3 space for a decade (actually for a decade ;)).\n\nOur current focus is on building Acre, a Bitcoin-in Bitcoin-out BTC staking platform, and Mezo, an Economic Layer for Bitcoin. Across the board, we are focused on building a new home for Bitcoin holders to cultivate Bitcoin and grow wealth together. Our projects are built with an emphasis on creating something useful with a clear value proposition rather than a perfect technical machine that provides unclear value.\n\nWe’re a fun, down-to-earth, fast-paced and highly collaborative team looking to expand our engineering (Go, Solidity, and TypeScript) and product capabilities (amongst other disciplines) and this is where you come in. Join a team that strives for excellence and help us build technology that enables the integrity and empowerment of the individual.\n\nCheck out our open positions at https://thesis.co/jobs .\n\nEdgeDB | SREs / Infrastructure Engineers | Full-time | Fully remote | https://www.edgedb.com/\n\nEdgeDB is an open-source database built on top of Postgres. It’s designed to give developers a better end-to-end user experience than traditional SQL databases. We provide a more expressive schema modeling & query language (EdgeQL), and \"batteries included\" features such as built-in schema migrations and a graphical schema browser, data explorer, and access control/auth.\n\nWe offer a hosted cloud service for EdgeDB, with the goal of doing developer-friendly cloud hosting \"the right way\" - we want users to use our hosted service because it's great, not because they're locked-in by restrictive licensing or cloud-only features.\n\nWe are looking for experienced SREs / infrastructure / devops engineers to help scale out our cloud. Unlike many infrastructure roles, this is not supporting a separate product team - for us, our infrastructure is our product. We are looking for people who care about not just building reliable infrastructure but also exposing that infrastructure to end-users as a seamless product.\n\nOur tech stack is Hashicorp tools (Terraform, Consul, Nomad, Vault); Postgres; Golang with some Python & Rust; and AWS (with eventual expansion to other cloud platforms)\n\nWe are a remote-first company, headquartered in San Francisco, with most of the team working in US/Canada timezones and a few people in Europe. Unfortunately we are unable to provide any visa/immigration sponsorship at this time.\n\nTo apply, send your resume to jobs at edgedb dot com and mention you saw this post on Hacker News.\n\nSpacelift | Remote | Europe | Full-time | Senior Software Engineer | $80k-$120k\n\nWe're a VC-funded startup building an automation platform for Infrastructure-as-Code, adding a Policy-as-Code layer above it, in order to make IaC usable in bigger companies, where you have to take care of state consistency, selective permissions, a usable git flow, etc.\n\nOn the backend we're using 100% Go with AWS primitives. We're looking for backend developers who like doing DevOps'y stuff sometimes (because in a way it's the spirit of our company), or have experience with the cloud native ecosystem. Ideally you'd have experience working with an IaC tool, i.e. Terraform, Pulumi, Ansible, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, or SaltStack.\n\nOverall we have a deeply technical product, trying to build something customers love to use, and already have a lot of happy and satisfied customers. We promise interesting work, the ability to open source parts of the project which don't give us a business advantage, as well as healthy working hours. We've also got investment days on Fridays, when you can work on anything you want, as long as it could possibly benefit Spacelift in some way.\n\nIf that sounds like fun to you, please apply at https://spacelift.teamtailor.com/jobs/3006934-software-engin...\n\nYou can find out more about the product we're building at https://spacelift.io and also see our engineering blog for a few technical blog posts of ours: https://spacelift.io/blog/engineering\n\nFullstory | Atlanta or Remote (USA) | https://www.fullstory.com/\n\nFullstory provides session replay and analytics for websites and mobile apps.

Experience with that is helpful, but we're really looking for someone who's interested in reverse engineering and diving into the depths of mobile applications, frameworks, and operating systems to understand how they work.\n\nAll the usual benefits: equity, healthcare, 401k matching (Vanguard), unlimited PTO (I take about 5 weeks a year), etc. You also get a sabbatical after 5 years of employment.\n\nFeel free to reply here or email nathan@[company site] if you have any questions.

We’re currently in the goldilocks zone of having product market fit with real revenue but also a really flat hierarchy where you can ship fast.\n\nWe want to accelerate product delivery (there’s so much to build!) so we’re looking to bring on high agency and experienced frontend engineers to work on high impact product features / frontend infrastructure. We’re building a small, focused, high performing frontend engineering team that works directly with the CEO leading the product. To help build this great team, we offer incredibly competitive compensation (based on Bay Area bands) and some interesting benefits(https://www.streak.com/careers#benefits). We want you to do the best work of your career here, so you should expect high autonomy and ownership.\n\nLastly, we believe the traditional interview process isn’t well correlated with an engineers’ ability to ship product. Instead, our interview process mimics what it’s actually like to work here. It’s highly asynchronous, favors writing and involves building something useful. We think this will give you a really good insight into our team and company and of course lets us assess if you’ll thrive here.\n\nSenior React Engineer | Ping Data Intelligence | ONSITE (Miami) or REMOTE | Full-Time | https://www.pingintel.com/\n\nPing Data Intelligence is a dynamic, three-year-old startup in Miami, FL, revolutionizing the property insurance sector with cutting-edge web technologies.

Solid business fundamentals - sustainability in every classroom with our revenue.\n\nTo align you to our approach: we seek out engineers who want to involve with this problem statements. Edtech v1.0 in India does not have a good rep (tell me about it!), but the problem statements remains: higher education system is broken, and not giving students the outcomes they are capable of (Here's the outcomes we deliver - https://kalvium.com/hire-from-us/).\n\nOur main realization is: we can't rely on people to drive a significant change, rather it has to be a system which builds and uplifts skills in students.

Our engineering culture is built on a foundation of autonomy & we don't consider an engineer fully ramped until they can \"choose their own loss function\". At Roboflow, engineers aren't just responsible for building things but also for helping us figure out what we should build next. We're builders & problem solvers; not just coders. (For this reason we also especially love hiring past and future founders.)\n\nWe're currently hiring full-stack engineers for our ML and web platform teams, a web developer to bridge our product and marketing teams, several technical roles on the sales & field engineering teams, and our first applied machine learning researcher to help push forward the state of the art in computer vision.\n\n[1]: https://roboflow.com/?ref=whoishiring1024\n\n[2]: https://roboflow.com/universe?ref=whoishiring1024\n\n[3]: https://github.com/autodistill/autodistill\n\n[4]: https://github.com/roboflow/supervision\n\n[5]: https://blog.roboflow.com/?ref=whoishiring1024\n\n[6]: https://www.youtube.com/@Roboflow\n\nMixRank (YC S11) | Software Engineers | 100% REMOTE (Global) | Full-Time\n\nMixRank processes petabytes of data every month from web crawling.

We're growing, profitable, employee-owned, no dependence on outside funding. Applicants from all geographies and backgrounds are welcome.\n\nWe are looking for passionate individuals for whom programming is not just a job but it’s something they love to do. We're obsessed with computers, programming, big data, databases, compilers, hardware, math, data science, and the internet. Does this sound like you? Please apply to join our team.\n\nOur code base is very friendly to new contributors. You'll have a fully-functional development environment within hours (fully automated) and be pushing commits on your first day. Deployments to production happen multiple times per day and finish in less than 2 minutes. Effectively all of our codebase is written in Python, Rust, SQL, Javascript/TypeScript, and Nix. The core technologies you'll need familiarity with to be productive are Python, PostgreSQL, Linux, and Git.\n\nWe operate at a larger scale than typical startups. We operate two datacenters with high performance servers we've built that are capable of dealing with the volumes of data we process. We've implemented our own distributed file system. We do full-scale web crawls. We download and perform static analysis on the entire universe of Android APKs and iOS IPAs that are published. Unlike a typical startup where you'll spend half of your time in meetings, and the other half fixing bugs from Jira tickets— at MixRank you'll get to challenge yourself with difficult technical problems that will help you to grow as an individual.\n\nWe're hiring continuously for the positions below— they aren't singular positions that will close once filled. Our philosophy on hiring is that the candidate is more important than the position. For each new member of the team, we design a custom role and responsibilities that are specialized to their interests. Other companies will come up with a long list of specific requirements for a position with the expectation that you'll exactly replace someone from the team, or that you'll be the perfect tetris piece that satisfies the job requirements decided by a committee. MixRank is more pragmatic: we'll first get excited about having a unique individual on the team, then we'll figure out the best way to accommodate their specific talents.\n\n--\n\nJunior Software Engineer - Remote (Global), Full-Time\n\nWe're looking for remote junior engineers that have 0-3 years of professional experience in software, and 5+ years of curiosity exploring computers, programming, and technical hobby projects.

We’re currently in the goldilocks zone of having product market fit with real revenue but also a really flat hierarchy where you can ship fast.\n\nWe want to accelerate product delivery (there’s so much to build!) so we’re looking to bring on high agency and experienced frontend engineers to work on high impact product features / frontend infrastructure. We’re building a small, focused, high performing frontend engineering team that works directly with the CEO leading the product. To help build this great team, we offer incredibly competitive compensation (based on Bay Area bands) and some interesting benefits(https://www.streak.com/careers#benefits). We want you to do the best work of your career here, so you should expect high autonomy and ownership.\n\nLastly, we believe the traditional interview process isn’t well correlated with an engineers’ ability to ship product. Instead, our interview process mimics what it’s actually like to work here. It’s highly asynchronous, favors writing and involves building something useful. We think this will give you a really good insight into our team and company and of course lets us assess if you’ll thrive here.\n\nSenior React Engineer | Ping Data Intelligence | ONSITE (Miami) or REMOTE | Full-Time | https://www.pingintel.com/\n\nPing Data Intelligence is a dynamic, three-year-old startup in Miami, FL, revolutionizing the property insurance sector with cutting-edge web technologies.

We need our first marketer, which is a big ownership opportunity. Seperately, as our DC gov side is especially growing, also on-site data scientists & data eng for cleared mission work at public trust / secret / top secret.\n\nLouie.AI is our expansion to making investigations even easier via generative AI UX and real-time AI KG (eg, real-time graph RAG). We are already launching with banks, govs, tech co's, etc. Complimenting Louie.AI's current self-hosted version, we are looking for a fullstack engineer to help drive our SaaS launch's multitenancy scaling work. The growth marketing is about the launch of louie.ai as an easier entrypoint into graph for key domains.\n\nWe have options both contractor, contract-to-hire, and full time:\n\n- The DC data roles are onsite reporting to leadership at a top enforcement agency, where we are expanding from 1 person to 3.

We’re a remote-first team of 35 people across North America. We’re growing and very profitable, and we have customers that love our product. We’re currently in the goldilocks zone of having product market fit with real revenue but also a really flat hierarchy where you can ship fast.\n\nWe want to accelerate product delivery (there’s so much to build!) so we’re looking to bring on high agency and experienced frontend engineers to work on high impact product features / frontend infrastructure. We’re building a small, focused, high performing frontend engineering team that works directly with the CEO leading the product. To help build this great team, we offer incredibly competitive compensation (based on Bay Area bands) and some interesting benefits(https://www.streak.com/careers#benefits). We want you to do the best work of your career here, so you should expect high autonomy and ownership.\n\nLastly, we believe the traditional interview process isn’t well correlated with an engineers’ ability to ship product. Instead, our interview process mimics what it’s actually like to work here. It’s highly asynchronous, favors writing and involves building something useful. We think this will give you a really good insight into our team and company and of course lets us assess if you’ll thrive here.\n\nHitchPin (https://hitchpin.com/)| Software Engineer| Full-time | Remote | $100k+ with equity and benefits\n\nHitchPin is a digital marketplace serving America's farmers and ranchers.

But a foundation model for 3D doesn't exist, likely because there isn't enough high-quality data to train a large model.\n\nThe quality bar of 3D assets for games, animation and VFX is really high. Well-topologized geometry and good surface parameterization (UVs) is table stakes for downstream rigging, animation and texturing.\n\nAt Fondant, we are building tools that combine SOTA computer graphics with generative AI for creating assets that can be animated and rigged. In this role you would be working with combining diffusion models with geometry processing, deformation, surface parameterization and skinning for high-quality animatable 3D assets.\n\nIf you are familiar with one or more of the above concepts, reach out at my username [at] fondant.design with a short blurb about yourself and link(s) to personal contribution(s) e.g., open-source code, cool demo of something you built etc.\n\nRoboflow | Infrastructure Engineer + ML Engineers + Full-Stack Engineers | Full-time (Remote, SF, NYC) | https://roboflow.com/careers?ref=whoishiring0924\n\nRoboflow is the fastest way to use computer vision in production.

Our end-to-end platform[1] provides tooling for image collection, annotation, dataset exploration and curation, training, and deployment.\n\nOver 250k engineers (including engineers from 2/3 Fortune 100 companies) build with Roboflow. We now host the largest collection of open source computer vision datasets and pre-trained models[2]. We are pushing forward the CV ecosystem with open source projects like Autodistill[3] and Supervision[4]. And we've built one of the most comprehensive resources for software engineers to learn to use computer vision with our popular blog[5] and YouTube channel[6].\n\nWe have several openings available but are primarily looking for strong technical generalists who want to help us democratize computer vision and like to wear many hats and have an outsized impact. Our engineering culture is built on a foundation of autonomy & we don't consider an engineer fully ramped until they can \"choose their own loss function\". At Roboflow, engineers aren't just responsible for building things but also for helping us figure out what we should build next. We're builders & problem solvers; not just coders. (For this reason we also especially love hiring past and future founders.)\n\nWe're currently hiring full-stack engineers for our ML and web platform teams, a web developer to bridge our product and marketing teams, several technical roles on the sales & field engineering teams, and our first applied machine learning researcher to help push forward the state of the art in computer vision.\n\n[1]: https://roboflow.com/?ref=whoishiring0924\n\n[2]: https://roboflow.com/universe?ref=whoishiring0924\n\n[3]: https://github.com/autodistill/autodistill\n\n[4]: https://github.com/roboflow/supervision\n\n[5]: https://blog.roboflow.com/?ref=whoishiring0924\n\n[6]: https://www.youtube.com/@Roboflow\n\nNvidia | Remote, see details below | Senior full stack | Full-time | React, C++, Helm, Go, Python, CUDA, Docker, distributed systems.\n\nNvidia, yeah, Nvidia. You already know.\n\nI am hiring for senior or principal developer technology engineers (DevTechs). At some companies, they are called application engineers. Nvidia has a very high bar of quality for these engineers, as they need to both have deep experience and understanding of software engineering and development, as well as excellent communications skills to work with external devs.\n\nThey are distinct from solution architects in that every DevTech is expected to be a seasoned professional engineer. It is a special forces engagement model where we approach high value strategic partners with deeply skilled engineers to accelerate their adoption of our platform.\n\nWhat you will be doing: Working closely with our strategic partners and internal teams to get the most out of our enterprise platform hardware/software stacks. This involves everything from serverless computing to optimizing end-to-end cloud workflows. It helps if you spent a few years grinding out C++. We are specifically looking for people who have front-end experience to help fill team gaps.\n\nAlso, if you are not super skilled at cloud infra, but are a steely-eyed computer engineer who has GPU accelerated your cat, feel free to apply to one of the roles as well. We have needs beyond just the cloud stuff.\n\nHow to apply: Email me directly at mclive at nvidia dot com, and apply to these roles on our career site:\n\nhttps://nvidia.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/NVIDIAExternalCar...\n\nhttps://nvidia.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/NVIDIAExternalCar...\n\nLocation: Nvidia is open to remote work.
