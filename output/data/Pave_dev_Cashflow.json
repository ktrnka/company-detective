By integrating Pave's real-time Cash Advance Score and Attributes, Ualett can now tailor advances and remittance schedules to each worker's specific financial situation, scaling their services while maintaining a personalized user experience.\n\nThe gig economy is experiencing significant growth, with over 70 million Americans already participating and projections estimating that gig workers will represent 50% of the U.S. workforce by 2027. As this workforce continues to expand, Ualett's ability to scale through automation and personalization is critical to meeting the growing demand for flexible financial solutions. The partnership with Pave positions Ualett at the forefront of financial services innovation, enabling more approvals for cash advances with the potential to reduce default rates by up to 50%.\n\n\"Our partnership with Pave is a major step forward in Ualett's mission to provide gig workers with flexible and reliable financial solutions,\" said Ricky Michel Presbot, CEO of Ualett. \"Pave's advanced cashflow analytics allow us to offer personalized cash advances tailored to each worker's income, with the potential to significantly reduce default rates. This partnership empowers us to scale while staying true to our commitment to each worker's unique financial needs, making financial stability more accessible for all.\"\n\n\"Ualett's mission aligns perfectly with what we're building at Pave - expanding access to funding for underserved and non-traditional borrowers,\" said Ema Rouf, Co-founder and President of Pave. \"Through our partnership with Ualett, we're enabling them to personalize financial solutions by using real-time cashflow insights, allowing them to scale and serve more customers who have been overlooked by traditional models.\"\n\nIn addition to personalization, the partnership enables Ualett to offer embedded financial solutions that fit seamlessly into the worker's existing workflows. Much like small businesses—where 7 out of 10 use multiple financial providers—gig workers often juggle various services to meet their financial needs. Ualett's integrated solutions simplify this process by offering a one-stop platform for accessing advances and managing remittances directly within the app, allowing gig workers to focus on their work without worrying about complicated financial processes.\n\nKey benefits of the Ualett-Pave partnership include:\n\nPersonalized advances and remittance schedules based on the worker's individual income or revenue\n\nFaster and more reliable access to cash, reducing wait times and increasing financial security without added risk\n\nAutomated cashflow insights, enabling Ualett to scale its services without sacrificing personalization\n\nEmbedded financial solutions, providing a seamless user experience for gig workers accessing and managing advances through the Ualett app\n\nFor more information about Ualett and its services, please visit www.ualett.com.\n\nAbout Ualett\n\nUalett is a leading financial technology company offering tailored cash advance solutions for gig economy workers, including rideshare drivers, delivery drivers, and small business owners.

Starting with mobile apps and a softphone, we're losing the jargon (who cares what an IVR is?) and building features customers actually want.\n\nWe try to be flexible around work and don't believe in regular 60-hour weeks. One key aim of our product is to help employees maintain a healthy work/life balance (who wants to be disturbed by business calls on the weekends?) in an age of remote and hybrid work. The founders lead by example, with all of us having worked 4-4.5 day weeks at times in order to spend time with our children.\n\nWe're looking for full stack software engineers and/or an iOS/android software engineer - doesn't matter if you're much stronger in either the front or back end, but you do need to be able to build all the parts of a feature - there's no \"front end team\" once the backend is done. There is naturally work that's much more one sided, so you won't be stuck for months on the back end if you prefer the front end, but we're still a small startup so we expect you to get stuck in and help out where you can!\n\nMore details here:\n\nhttps://www.ycombinator.com/companies/devyce/jobs/TkP5L5W-fr... https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/devyce/jobs/XP9GqCz-mo...\n\nOr email alistair.clark@devyce.co.uk and mention that you saw this on Ask HN: Who is hiring?\n\nPolarsteps | Back End, Android | Amsterdam, The Netherlands | Full-time (or 4 days/week) | Hybrid | VISA (with relocation package) | https://careers.polarsteps.com/\n\nWe're an Amsterdam-based team of 60 (and counting) with 20+ nationalities amongst us – a varied, skilled bunch of \"Citizens of The World\" with hundreds of thousands of kilometers under our travel belts.

We are building the google-maps of education - the only edtech where we bring a focused, standardized, digital approach to CS higher education. I speak about this on this podcast (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be1yEJbyEkQ).\n\nHere's 3 cool things we've done:\n\n1. 100% AI based evaluators in B.Tech CS 4 year program.\n\n2. Launched our full-fledged program in 20+ universities in India, where students are placed from 3rd semester onwards. This year we've had more premium universities signup: SRM, VIT, Christ, etc.\n\n3. Solid business fundamentals - sustainability in every classroom with our revenue.\n\nTo align you to our approach: we seek out engineers who want to involve with this problem statements. Edtech v1.0 in India does not have a good rep (tell me about it!), but the problem statements remains: higher education system is broken, and not giving students the outcomes they are capable of (Here's the outcomes we deliver - https://kalvium.com/hire-from-us/).\n\nOur main realization is: we can't rely on people to drive a significant change, rather it has to be a system which builds and uplifts skills in students. That's what we've built and launched in above universities (https://kalvium.com/heros/). We have a 12 year roadmap! it's a blue ocean, and we want to build and lead Edtech V2.0.\n\nNote on team/compensation: We plan on being a small core team that geeks out on learning and platform-izing it! Our pay is commensurate to experience with meaningful equity. We plan for a 4 year path of growth for every individual in our team.

We also know from experience that the tools from the tech industry often don't translate well to biology, and that we need to be fearless in adapting or rebuilding whatever is necessary to get the job done.\n\nWe're backed by an incredible set of investors and angels, including Jeff Dean, and we're excited to have the chance to build some awesome & impactful technology with some awesome people.\n\nEmail me to learn more: tim@\n\n[1] https://github.com/hail-is/hail [2] https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/\n\nLightning Labs | Senior Engineering Manager, Lightning Protocol Engineer, Senior Security Engineer| San Francisco | Remote | Full-time\n\nhttps://lightning.engineering/join-us\n\nhttps://github.com/lightninglabs\n\nLightning Labs is hiring!

We help developers give their software the sense of sight. Our end-to-end platform[1] provides tooling for image collection, annotation, dataset exploration and curation, training, and deployment.\n\nOver 250k engineers (including engineers from 2/3 Fortune 100 companies) build with Roboflow. We now host the largest collection of open source computer vision datasets and pre-trained models[2]. We are pushing forward the CV ecosystem with open source projects like Autodistill[3] and Supervision[4]. And we've built one of the most comprehensive resources for software engineers to learn to use computer vision with our popular blog[5] and YouTube channel[6].\n\nWe have several openings available but are primarily looking for strong technical generalists who want to help us democratize computer vision and like to wear many hats and have an outsized impact. Our engineering culture is built on a foundation of autonomy & we don't consider an engineer fully ramped until they can \"choose their own loss function\". At Roboflow, engineers aren't just responsible for building things but also for helping us figure out what we should build next. We're builders & problem solvers; not just coders. (For this reason we also especially love hiring past and future founders.)\n\nWe're currently hiring full-stack engineers for our ML and web platform teams, a web developer to bridge our product and marketing teams, several technical roles on the sales & field engineering teams, and our first applied machine learning researcher to help push forward the state of the art in computer vision.\n\n[1]: https://roboflow.com/?ref=whoishiring1024\n\n[2]: https://roboflow.com/universe?ref=whoishiring1024\n\n[3]: https://github.com/autodistill/autodistill\n\n[4]: https://github.com/roboflow/supervision\n\n[5]: https://blog.roboflow.com/?ref=whoishiring1024\n\n[6]: https://www.youtube.com/@Roboflow\n\nMixRank (YC S11) | Software Engineers | 100% REMOTE (Global) | Full-Time\n\nMixRank processes petabytes of data every month from web crawling. We have hundreds of customers using our data products including Google, Amazon, Facebook, Intel, and Adobe, across industries including Finance, Recruiting, Sales, Marketing, and Security.\n\nWe’re a fully-remote company with a global footprint in over 20 countries. We're growing, profitable, employee-owned, no dependence on outside funding. Applicants from all geographies and backgrounds are welcome.\n\nWe are looking for passionate individuals for whom programming is not just a job but it’s something they love to do. We're obsessed with computers, programming, big data, databases, compilers, hardware, math, data science, and the internet. Does this sound like you? Please apply to join our team.\n\nOur code base is very friendly to new contributors. You'll have a fully-functional development environment within hours (fully automated) and be pushing commits on your first day. Deployments to production happen multiple times per day and finish in less than 2 minutes. Effectively all of our codebase is written in Python, Rust, SQL, Javascript/TypeScript, and Nix. The core technologies you'll need familiarity with to be productive are Python, PostgreSQL, Linux, and Git.\n\nWe operate at a larger scale than typical startups. We operate two datacenters with high performance servers we've built that are capable of dealing with the volumes of data we process. We've implemented our own distributed file system. We do full-scale web crawls. We download and perform static analysis on the entire universe of Android APKs and iOS IPAs that are published. Unlike a typical startup where you'll spend half of your time in meetings, and the other half fixing bugs from Jira tickets— at MixRank you'll get to challenge yourself with difficult technical problems that will help you to grow as an individual.\n\nWe're hiring continuously for the positions below— they aren't singular positions that will close once filled. Our philosophy on hiring is that the candidate is more important than the position. For each new member of the team, we design a custom role and responsibilities that are specialized to their interests. Other companies will come up with a long list of specific requirements for a position with the expectation that you'll exactly replace someone from the team, or that you'll be the perfect tetris piece that satisfies the job requirements decided by a committee. MixRank is more pragmatic: we'll first get excited about having a unique individual on the team, then we'll figure out the best way to accommodate their specific talents.\n\n--\n\nJunior Software Engineer - Remote (Global), Full-Time\n\nWe're looking for remote junior engineers that have 0-3 years of professional experience in software, and 5+ years of curiosity exploring computers, programming, and technical hobby projects. This is an open-ended entry role with mentorship and diverse opportunities to work on all areas of our product: databases, distributed systems, infrastructure and tooling, data analysis, machine learning, frontend/backend web development, APIs, data mining, data modeling, and more. To stand out, please highlight what makes you unique: passion for computing, curiosity and side projects, work ethic, niche research, etc.\n\nIdeally you've already graduated, but if you still have one or more years left of school, please feel free to apply anyway, and if you're the right fit for the team we'll figure out a way to accommodate your schedule.\n\n--\n\nSoftware Engineer - Remote (Global), Full-Time\n\nWe're hiring generalist software engineers to work on web applications, data mining, machine learning/data science, data transformation/ETL, data modeling, database scaling, infrastructure, devops, and more. We'll cater the role to whatever subset of these areas match your interests.\n\nBeneficial experience includes PostgreSQL, Python, Rust, Linux, TypeScript, Nix, frontend/backend web development, and data mining.\n\n--\n\nEx-Founders (all roles) - Remote (Global), Full-Time\n\nWe encourage founders in software engineering, sales, marketing, customer success, design, and product to reach out. If you don't see a relevant position open, reach out to jobs at mixrank.com. We care more about the person than the job position, and we're happy to craft the perfect position for anyone that joins our team. People with founder experience tend to be very successful at MixRank, and our leadership team is filled with founders.\n\n--\n\nI'm Scott, Founder/CEO/CTO.

We provide a more expressive schema modeling & query language (EdgeQL), and \"batteries included\" features such as built-in schema migrations and a graphical schema browser, data explorer, and access control/auth.\n\nWe offer a hosted cloud service for EdgeDB, with the goal of doing developer-friendly cloud hosting \"the right way\" - we want users to use our hosted service because it's great, not because they're locked-in by restrictive licensing or cloud-only features.\n\nWe are looking for experienced SREs / infrastructure / devops engineers to help scale out our cloud. Unlike many infrastructure roles, this is not supporting a separate product team - for us, our infrastructure is our product. We are looking for people who care about not just building reliable infrastructure but also exposing that infrastructure to end-users as a seamless product.\n\nOur tech stack is Hashicorp tools (Terraform, Consul, Nomad, Vault); Postgres; Golang with some Python & Rust; and AWS (with eventual expansion to other cloud platforms)\n\nWe are a remote-first company, headquartered in San Francisco, with most of the team working in US/Canada timezones and a few people in Europe.

After raising a seed round from top-tier investors just over a year ago, we launched a first version of our service in several states. Customer feedback has been enthusiastic (NPS hovering above 80) and unit economics look good, so we are working to scale the service and make it available nationwide by early 2025. You won’t find much about us online yet, but we’ll share our story more publicly soon.\n\nWe're looking for engineers who are excited about building a seamless and beautiful consumer healthcare product. We care deeply about technical excellence but also move quickly. We don’t expect you to have a healthcare background (though it’s great if you do!), but you should be excited by the prospect of digging into the messy complexities of the American healthcare system (navigating price transparency data from payers, integrating with EHRs, medical billing, provider credentialing, etc).\n\nIf that sounds exciting to you, email me at noah@nile.health\n\nONSITE in Prague, Czech Republic\n\nLinux C++ Engineer for Camera Development\n\nMosaic is seeking an experienced Linux C++ developer to assist our team in developing advanced industrial 360º camera systems.

We’re a remote-first team of 35 people across North America. We’re growing and very profitable, and we have customers that love our product. We’re currently in the goldilocks zone of having product market fit with real revenue but also a really flat hierarchy where you can ship fast.\n\nWe want to accelerate product delivery (there’s so much to build!) so we’re looking to bring on high agency and experienced frontend engineers to work on high impact product features / frontend infrastructure. We’re building a small, focused, high performing frontend engineering team that works directly with the CEO leading the product. To help build this great team, we offer incredibly competitive compensation (based on Bay Area bands) and some interesting benefits(https://www.streak.com/careers#benefits). We want you to do the best work of your career here, so you should expect high autonomy and ownership.\n\nLastly, we believe the traditional interview process isn’t well correlated with an engineers’ ability to ship product. Instead, our interview process mimics what it’s actually like to work here. It’s highly asynchronous, favors writing and involves building something useful. We think this will give you a really good insight into our team and company and of course lets us assess if you’ll thrive here.\n\nSenior React Engineer | Ping Data Intelligence | ONSITE (Miami) or REMOTE | Full-Time | https://www.pingintel.com/\n\nPing Data Intelligence is a dynamic, three-year-old startup in Miami, FL, revolutionizing the property insurance sector with cutting-edge web technologies.
