      "# [Power credit decisions with cashflow intelligence](https://pave.dev/blog/announcing-the-flexible-rent-score)\nWe’re thrilled to introduce the latest addition to our suite of Cashflow-driven Scores: the Flexible Rent Score. Designed to meet the evolving needs of property management solution providers, this score helps you confidently assess tenant risk, offer personalized payment options, and reduce defaults—all while expanding approvals.\n\nWhat is Flexible Rent?\n\nFlexible Rent products allow tenants to divide their monthly rent into smaller, more manageable installments. These services pay the full rent amount upfront to landlords, ensuring timely payments, while tenants repay the service according to a personalized schedule aligned with their cash flow. This approach reduces financial strain on tenants and provides consistent cash flow for property managers.\n\nWhy a Flexible Rent Score?\n\nRental markets are changing. More tenants, such as gig workers and part-time employees, need payment options that match their income flow. At the same time, property managers face mounting challenges:\n\nHigh Default Risk: First payment defaults and NSF (Non-Sufficient Funds) fees eat into profits and operational efficiency.\n\nIneffective Screening: Generic credit scores fail to capture the unique repayment behaviors of today’s diverse renter base.\n\nMissed Opportunities: Safe, reliable tenants often get overlooked because traditional assessments can’t accommodate nontraditional incomes.\n\nThe Flexible Rent Score addresses these challenges by offering a clear, data-driven prediction of a tenant’s likelihood to pay a flexible rent payment within a given month. This gives property managers actionable insights to:\n\nReduce Defaults and NSF Fees: Spot reliable tenants and avoid costly missed payments.\n\nOffer Flexible Payment Options: Approve more tenants and provide customized rent schedules aligned with their cash flow.\n\nExpand Approvals with Confidence: Say “yes” to more tenants, even those with nontraditional income sources.\n\nCheck out this video:\n\nUse Case: Smarter Tenant Screening\n\nImagine you’re evaluating a potential tenant who’s a gig worker with irregular income. With generic rank-ordering scores, they might seem risky. But with the Flexible Rent Score, you get a more accurate assessment of their repayment potential.\n\nLower scores highlight potential risks, allowing you to implement safeguards before approving the lease.\n\nHigh scores suggest dependable tenants who can pay promptly.\n\nIf the score indicates the tenant is 80% likely to pay on time, you can confidently adjust terms, request a guarantor, or offer a tailored payment plan.\n\nHow It Works\n\nThe Flexible Rent Score leverages Pave’s Cashflow Attributes to evaluate rent-specific financial behaviors.\n\nReal-Time Financial Data: We analyze up-to-date income, spending, and account balances.\n\nIdentifying Rent Transactions: Our system detects rent-related transactions and assigns confidence levels to each.\n\nPredictive Modeling: Using machine learning, we forecast the likelihood of timely flexible rent payments.\n\nCustom Payment Plans: Combine the score with Cashflow Attributes (like income patterns) to align rent schedules with tenants’ cash flow.\n\nWant deeper insights? Rent-specific transactions are accessible through the Rent endpoint in Pave’s API.\n\nReal-World Impact: Doubling Approvals, Reducing Defaults\n\nThe Flexible Rent Score isn’t just theoretical—it delivers measurable results. In one case study, a flexible rent provider achieved:\n\nApproval rates jumped from 18% to 50%.\n\nCollections dropped from over 30% to under 6%.\n\nBy analyzing key behaviors like income stability, savings patterns, and repayment trends, they confidently approved more tenants while reducing risk.\n\nUnlocking Flexibility for Renters\n\nFlexible Rent products, powered by the Flexible Rent Score, let tenants break rent payments into manageable installments. Landlords get full rent upfront, while tenants repay according to personalized schedules. The result?\n\nReduced financial stress for tenants.\n\nMore consistent cash flow for property managers.\n\nA Better Way to Approve Tenants\n\nWith the Flexible Rent Score, property managers can:\n\nApprove more qualified tenants.\n\nOffer tailored payment plans to meet tenants’ unique needs.\n\nReduce risk and improve operational efficiency.\n\nReady to See the Flexible Rent Score in Action?\n\nLet’s build a future where rental flexibility and financial security coexist.

      "# [Power credit decisions with cashflow intelligence](https://pave.dev/blog/announcing-the-fuel-charge-card-score)\nManaging credit risk for fleet cards just got easier. With Pave’s new Fuel Charge Card Score, fleet card providers can now set dynamic credit limits based on a business’s cashflow and repayment behavior. The result? Fewer defaults, better repayments, and credit limits that grow with businesses.\n\nWhat is a Fuel Charge Card?\n\nA fuel charge card is a type of charge card that businesses use to pay for fuel expenses. These cards provide businesses with the flexibility to manage fuel costs for their vehicles without immediate out-of-pocket payments. However, setting appropriate credit limits is crucial to balance growth and risk.\n\nWhy a Fuel Charge Card Score?\n\nMany small businesses rely on fuel charge cards to keep operations moving. However, traditional underwriting methods often miss key insights, leading to rigid credit limits that either stifle growth or increase risk. Fuel charge card providers face several challenges:\n\nHigh Default Risk: First payment defaults and NSF (Non-Sufficient Funds) fees affect profits and operational efficiency.\n\nIneffective Underwriting: Generic credit scores fail to capture the unique repayment behaviors of each small business\n\nMissed Opportunities: Businesses with healthy cashflows often get overlooked because traditional assessments don’t accommodate new businesses with little credit history\n\nAt Pave, we're leveraging cashflow analytics to empower lenders to expand access to borrowers with less credit visibility. On top of that, we’re getting even more nuanced with cashflow scores that fit each credit product — because a mortgage isn't a small-dollar loan, a business line of credit isn't a merchant cash advance, and a charge card isn't a credit card.\n\nThe Fuel Charge Card Score gives you a cashflow-driven assessment specific to the industry of a business's ability to manage and repay fuel expenses. By leveraging real-time bank transaction data, fuel charge card payment history, and credit reports (when available), the score helps providers:\n\nAssess repayment risk based on statement balances and due dates,\n\nOptimize approvals and credit limits for both new and existing users, and\n\nIdentify at-risk accounts early to manage delinquencies.\n\nCheck out this video:\n\nUse Case: Smarter Fuel Charge Card Limits\n\nBy using the Fuel Charge Card Score, fleet card providers can get a more accurate assessment of a business’s repayment potential:\n\nHigh scores indicate a strong likelihood of on-time repayment and low delinquency risk,\n\nLower scores highlight the need for tighter credit limits or closer account monitoring.\n\nFor example, a user with a high score might safely manage a $3,500 monthly statement, whereas a lower-scoring user may require additional scrutiny or reduced limits.\n\nFleet card underwriting doesn’t have to be static. With Pave’s Fuel Charge Card Score, you can unlock flexibility, reduce risk, and support business growth.\n\nHow it Works\n\nThe Fuel Charge Card Score leverages Pave’s Cashflow Attributes to evaluate fuel charge card specific financial behaviors.\n\nReal-Time Financial Data: We analyze up-to-date revenue, operating expense patterns, loan payments, account balances, and more to provide a clear picture of a business's financial health.\n\nIdentifying Fuel Charge Card Transactions: Our system detects fuel charge card related transactions.\n\nPredictive Modeling: Using machine learning, we forecast the likelihood of timely fuel charge card payments based on statement balances and due dates.\n\nDynamic Limit Setting: Combine the score with Cashflow Attributes (like revenue patterns and balance trends) to set limits that align with the business’s cash flow.\n\nThe score, along with its underlying attributes enhances proprietary underwriting models—they don’t replace it.\n\nUnlocking Flexibility for Businesses\n\nFuel charge cards, powered by the Fuel Charge Card Score, enable businesses to manage fuel expenses effectively while reducing the risk of delinquencies. Providers can confidently extend credit, knowing they have a data-driven view of repayment likelihood. The result?\n\nReduced delinquencies and improved cash flow for providers.\n\nStreamlined fuel expense management for businesses.\n\nA Better Way to Assess Risk\n\nWith the Fuel Charge Card Score, providers can:\n\nApprove more businesses with confidence.\n\nSet tailored credit limits that align with a business’s cash flow.\n\nReduce risk while enhancing operational efficiency.\n\nReady to see the Fuel Charge Card in action?\n\nWith a score tailored to real-time cashflow data, you can make smarter credit decisions, reduce delinquencies, and optimize fuel card offerings for your customers.",
      "# [Power credit decisions with cashflow intelligence](https://pave.dev/blog/announcing-the-new-cash-advance-score)\nWe’re thrilled to introduce our new Cash Advance Score. This new Score offers a risk assessment of a user’s ability to repay specific cash advance amounts.\n\nThe Cash Advance Score is trained on millions of cash advances and hundreds of Attributes such as overdraft fees, changes in income, balance trends, and more.\n\nUse Cases\n\nIntroduce Higher Advance Amounts\n\nThe new Score minimizes the risk associated with introducing higher advance amounts by removing the guesswork on how your users would repay these advances. Instead, you can use a high Cash Advance Score threshold for approval, and gradually lower this as you observe the repayment rate.\n\nReduce Cash Advance Defaults\n\nReject poor-scoring users who would have otherwise been approved.\n\nIncrease Approvals\n\nApprove high-scoring users who would have otherwise been denied.\n\nMinimize Portfolio Risk\n\nThe new Score allows you to minimize the overall risk in your portfolio by giving higher advance amounts to the least risky users, and lower amounts (or denying advances) to the riskiest users.\n\nYou can get started with our new Score here: https://docs.pave.dev/scores/get-cash-advance-score\n\nRead more about our Cash Advance use case here.\n\nHere are some FAQs to get you started\n\nWhat’s the performance of the Cash Advance Score model?\n\nThe Cash Advance Score model had an AUC of 0.86 on a holdout dataset.\n\nHow do I access the Cash Advance Score?\n\nYou can get a user’s Cash Advance Score by calling the GET /users/{user_id}/scores/cash_advance endpoint.\n\nIn addition, you can view the Cash Advance Score across your entire user base through our Cashflow Analytics for Snowflake. Contact us at api@pave.dev if you require access to this product.\n\nWill you provide analytics on how the Cash Advance Score performs on my data?\n\nOnce we receive live access to your underwriting and collections data, we can generate a dashboard with analytics on how the Cash Advance Score performs on your advances.\n\nSee the example image below.\n\nWhat’s the repayment period predicted by the Cash Advance Score model? How can I specify a different repayment period?\n\nThe Cash Advance Score predicts the likelihood of repayment within 30 days. However, higher Scores are also correlated with shorter repayment periods. For example, for 80% chance of repayment, a user may need a score of:\n\n981 for 7 days repayment\n\n767 for 15 days repayment\n\n657 for 30 days repayment\n\n580 for 45 days repayment\n\nThus, if you want to optimize repayments for periods shorter than 30 days, you can increase the minimum Score threshold. Inversely, you can decrease this threshold if you want to optimize repayments for periods longer than 30 days.\n\nWhat threshold do you suggest I use to underwrite my users?\n\nThe minimum Score threshold you use in your underwriting will depend on your risk appetite as well as the advance amount that you’re evaluating. Generally, we divide the Cash Advance Score as follows:\n\nExcellent (657 to 999): +80% chance of being repaid within 30 days\n\nGood (437 to 656): 60% to 80% chance of being repaid within 30 days\n\nAverage (287 to 436): 40% to 60% chance of being repaid within 30 days\n\nPoor (100 to 286): Less than 40% chance of being repaid within 30 days\n\n‍",
      "# [Power credit decisions with cashflow intelligence](https://pave.dev/blog/announcing-the-payroll-prediction-model)\nWe’ve released our Payroll Prediction Model! Our model detects a user’s payroll transactions, clusters recurring payroll streams, and accurately predicts the next payment date and amount.\n\nWhy this matters\n\nPeople living paycheck to paycheck can find themselves overdrafting their accounts and getting hit with fees due to uncertainty around expected income and spending. Allow your users to see when they will likely get paid next so they can plan accordingly. Identifying the predicted income deposit date can also allow cash advance apps to avoid causing overdraft or NSF fees when pulling a payment from a user’s account. Lastly, loan repayment plans are often not aligned with the paycheck cycle for a user. Pave’s Payroll Prediction allows you to customize debt repayment plans according to the user’s predicted payroll cycle.\n\nUse this model to:\n\nUnderstand a user’s payroll frequency\n\nPredict the payroll’s next_date and next_amount\n\nUse Cases\n\nCashflow underwriting\n\nOptimizing loan repayment schedules\n\nPredicting overdrafts\n\nReducing Cash Advance NSFs\n\nBuild Cashflow forecasting tools\n\nHere are some FAQs to get you started.\n\nHow far out does the model predict paychecks?\n\nCurrently, we predict the next payroll date and next payroll amount.\n\nHow much historical data do I need to upload for a user in order for the model to predict a paycheck?\n\nA minimum of 2 months of transaction history is necessary to detect recurring payroll deposits and to be able to predict the next paycheck deposit.\n\nWhere do I access this prediction?\n\nSee our recurring_income endpoint here: https://docs.pave.dev/insights/recurring_income and in our attributes endpoint here: https://docs.pave.dev/attributes\n\nDocumentation\n\nYou can find the documentation here –\n\nhttps://docs.pave.dev/insights/recurring_income\n\nhttps://docs.pave.dev/attributes\n\n‍",
      "# [Power credit decisions with cashflow intelligence](https://pave.dev/blog/cash-advance-usage-increased-39-in-the-past-6-months)\nA Quick Overview:\n\nUsers who received cash advances in March 2022 had a 38.92% increase in cash advance deposits in August 2022\n\nRepayment rates over this period were over 93%\n\nSo far, it’s been hard to see a comprehensive and real-time picture of all debt and cash advance payments (especially for EWA and cash advance products) – Pave.dev’s Cashflow API is changing that.\n\nThe premise is simple:\n\nWhy should someone have to wait weeks to access the money they’ve already earned?\n\nIn this post, we’ll look at:\n\nKey drivers fueling the growth of these services\n\nDefining Cash Advance and Earned Wage Access\n\nTrends we’re seeing in our analysis across millions of consumers\n\nKey Drivers behind the Growth of Cash Advance and Earned Wage Access\n\nRising Cost of Essential Goods\n\nFirst, the rising costs of essentials like gas and groceries mean that millions of people have less money between paychecks. They struggle to pay their bills and emergency expenses. Increasingly, they’re turning to cash advance apps to help them access some of their next paycheck a few days or weeks early – especially when they don’t have access to credit.\n\nHigh Cost of Overdraft Fees\n\nSecond, overdraft fees cost people an average of $30 per overdraft. Even just a few dollars can cause an account to go negative. In 2020, banks earned $11.8 billion in revenue for overdraft fees alone. Households who are already financially vulnerable pay most of these fees, forcing consumers to find lower-cost solutions like cash advances.\n\nLower Barriers for Creating Solutions\n\nThird, financial infrastructure including BaaS platforms like Unit and Bond, Payroll APIs like Atomic and Pinwheel, and bank aggregators like Plaid and MX are making it possible for fintech companies to rapidly build and launch cash advance programs. Startups offering EWA products raised over $1.13 billion in 2021.\n\nLet’s Cover the Basics:\n\nWhat is Earned Wage Access?\n\nEarned Wage Access (EWA) or On-Demand Pay allows an employee to receive a portion of their earned wages ahead of their regular pay cycle. When payday comes, the amount of early wages they received is debited from their paycheck. Companies like Zayzoon, Payactiv, and DailyPay are just some examples of the number of fintechs that are offering this benefit.\n\nWhat is Cash Advance?\n\nA cash advance allows a person to access some of their paycheck before their actual payday – the consumer repays the advance from their account, oftentimes once their paycheck deposits.\n\nPopular apps like FloatMe and Grid offer consumers an opportunity to get up to $250. Cash advance companies use evaluation criteria such as direct deposit history and spending habits to gauge whether users will repay and how much to advance them.\n\nIn sum, these companies give consumers the extra buffer they need to get to the next paycheck – without getting trapped in a cycle of over-borrowing.\n\nA look into the data\n\nWe analyzed a segment of our dataset representing 5 million transactions and 51,000 users who took out cash advances or EWA. This segment comes from a total anonymized set of 111 million bank transactions.\n\nHere are some interesting findings:\n\nIncrease in Cash Advance and EWA app usage\n\nBelow are the average cash advance and EWA amounts and frequencies for these 51,000 users.\n\nWe honed in on a cohort of 18,000 users who received a cash advance or EWA in March 2022. This helped us understand how consumers are using these services over time.\n\nThe dollar amount deposited per user increased by 38.92% for Cash Advance and 17.11% for EWA from March to August 2022.\n\nSeveral drivers behind this increasing usage:\n\nBills such as utilities, loans, and rent increased by 4.5% MoM, likely causing people to take out more advances\n\nUsers are signing up for additional cash advance services to make ends meet\n\nUsers are taking on more frequent advances compared to previous months\n\nPositive repayment history allows users to take higher dollar amounts\n\nEvidence of Repayment\n\nWe’ve seen that usage is increasing. But are people repaying the advances once they’ve covered their expenses?\n\nYes – and the repayment rate is extremely high. Within 45 days, 93.05% of advances are repaid. The ability to track repayment history is an important factor in measuring a person’s financial health and responsibility. In this case, it demonstrates that people can use advances responsibly. In contrast, only 44% of credit card users pay off their balance, according to a GoBankingRates study.\n\nReal World Stories\n\nBefore we get into more data, it’s important to acknowledge real-world stories shared by people who are using these solutions.\n\nThe reviews below exemplify how much a cash advance of $20 can help a family.\n\nThese solutions are making an impact. People can get their earned wages when they need them, not just when their paycheck is scheduled to land.\n\nInsights on Spending Habits\n\nPave’s ability to track key transaction information like when and where they happened helps explain some of the reasons why people are using cash advances.\n\nOur data shows that the most common expenditures made following cash advances and EWA deposits are as follows:\n\nBottom Line\n\nAmericans want access to their earned wages faster, and financial services are catching on. These products can help to improve consumers’ financial health. They give them access to funds that help maintain timely bill and debt payments as well as cover unexpected expenses – without incurring unnecessary fees, or even worse – taking out a predatory payday loan or title loan.\n\nTo put it into perspective, 61% of Americans (around 157 million adults) reported that they live paycheck to paycheck, according to a June 2022 Lending Club Report. Having access to extra cash and earned wages can be the difference between getting by or not having enough to buy groceries.\n\nPeople are increasingly struggling to get by between paychecks. Right now, these advanced access solutions may just be the answer.\n\nWhat’s ahead\n\nThe demand and the need for getting paid faster are clear in both the data and employee surveys – and the market is responding.\n\nCash Advance is expanding\n\nVertical SaaS solutions are emerging in almost every industry enabling Earned Wage Access solutions.\n\nA few examples include SMB payroll and scheduling software like Homebase, creator platforms like Patreon and Lumanu, and restaurant software like Toast. They’re addressing America’s demand for payday flexibility, and benefitting from loyal customers and employees.\n\nHow Pave helps companies manage Cash Advance risk\n\nThe approval process for advances takes significant time and effort to implement and build a robust process around. In addition, as more companies offer cash advances and EWA, they increasingly take on the risk of users defaulting on their repayments.\n\nPave offers a few products to help companies build out their approval process, minimize cash advance defaults, and maximize repayments:\n\n100+ affordability attributes to analyze a user’s balance history, loan payments (including other BNPL), cash advance history, recurring expenses, spending patterns, fees, income history, and more.\n\nCash Advance Score that predicts the likelihood a user will repay a cash advance within a given period of time. Our score is trained on a growing dataset of millions of cash advance deposits and repayments, allowing newer fintechs to take advantage of a large training dataset that they’ve not yet accumulated.\n\nPredicted next payroll date allows companies to forecast when to pull a cash advance repayment, reducing the risk of pulling the repayment too early and causing the user to go into overdraft.\n\nUsing Pave’s products, newer companies can bypass much of the effort it takes to build out a cash advance model, and companies later on in their production can boost their modeling efforts with new attributes.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile early access to wages is a promising tool to help alleviate temporary cashflow challenges, it’s by no means an end-all solution to people becoming financially healthier.\n\nIt is, however, a gateway solution to help people develop financial management skills like credit building, debt payoff, and spending management. People need immediate help, and cash advance is a bandaid – it creates a wedge to empower people with the experience to responsibly manage longer-term financial challenges.\n\nSee how our Cashflow API powers insights for Cash Advance services.\n\nInterested in learning more?

      "# [Power credit decisions with cashflow intelligence](https://pave.dev/blog/how-pave-helped-a-top-10-cash-advance-provider-increase-advance-amounts-by-74)\nAmidst requests for higher cash advance limits, cash advance providers are actively seeking ways to safely increase advance amounts for low-risk users.\n\nWe’re excited to share our recent case study, which reveals how a top 10 cash advance provider’s implementation of Pave’s Cash Advance Score helped them achieve:\n\n74% increase in advance amounts\n\n13% decrease in defaults\n\n18% increase in net revenue\n\nImproved operational efficiency and user satisfaction\n\nMarket Trends\n\nProjected to grow from $73.7 billion in 2022 to $138.5 billion by 2032, the cash advance market’s expansion reflects a growing demand for fast financing among consumers and businesses. However, this demand often leads to the use of high-cost loans with rates often exceeding 400%, stressing the need for more affordable options\n\nTo more responsibly get consumers their funds, consumer cash advance providers like Vola, Empower, Beem, Grid, Cleo, MoneyLion and merchant cash advance providers like Amazon via Parafin, Square, PayPal via a partnership with Fibe (EarlySalary), and Finova Capital are looking for ways to responsibly increase advance amounts to meet demand.\n\nAbout the Cash Advance Score\n\nPave’s Cash Advance Score is trained on a wide variety of users and thousands of attributes, including their history of repaying higher amounts with other providers. This allows providers to increase advance amounts to low-risk users while decreasing overall risk.\n\nThe underlying Attributes encompass signals like different forms of income (e.g. social security, gig income, government benefits, etc.), the number of advances a user has defaulted on, the amount of unpaid advances they currently have, and more.\n\nRead more on the case study: https://pave.dev/case-study-cash-advance-provider-increased-amounts-by-74/\n\nWatch an overview video and read more about the Cash Advance Score here.

Starting with mobile apps and a softphone, we're losing the jargon (who cares what an IVR is?) and building features customers actually want.\n\nWe try to be flexible around work and don't believe in regular 60-hour weeks. One key aim of our product is to help employees maintain a healthy work/life balance (who wants to be disturbed by business calls on the weekends?) in an age of remote and hybrid work. The founders lead by example, with all of us having worked 4-4.5 day weeks at times in order to spend time with our children.\n\nWe're looking for full stack software engineers and/or an iOS/android software engineer - doesn't matter if you're much stronger in either the front or back end, but you do need to be able to build all the parts of a feature - there's no \"front end team\" once the backend is done. There is naturally work that's much more one sided, so you won't be stuck for months on the back end if you prefer the front end, but we're still a small startup so we expect you to get stuck in and help out where you can!\n\nMore details here:\n\nhttps://www.ycombinator.com/companies/devyce/jobs/TkP5L5W-fr... https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/devyce/jobs/XP9GqCz-mo...\n\nOr email alistair.clark@devyce.co.uk and mention that you saw this on Ask HN: Who is hiring?\n\nPolarsteps | Back End, Android | Amsterdam, The Netherlands | Full-time (or 4 days/week) | Hybrid | VISA (with relocation package) | https://careers.polarsteps.com/\n\nWe're an Amsterdam-based team of 60 (and counting) with 20+ nationalities amongst us – a varied, skilled bunch of \"Citizens of The World\" with hundreds of thousands of kilometers under our travel belts. We also have something important in common (other than our very well-worn passports): We want to change the way people travel.\n\nAnd that's exactly what we're doing, with _the_ travel app to plan, track, and relive your journeys in a smart and beautiful way. Our product is at the core of everything that we do, and we always put our users first, so you will always have all the space you need to build things in the best possible way - there's a reason why we have a 4.8 star user rating on both Play Store and App Store ;)\n\nWe have over 10 million users and currently growing our engineering team, read more about the roles here:\n\n- Senior Backend Engineer: https://careers.polarsteps.com/vacancies/c80ae5b6-1bd0-4de7-...\n\n- Senior Android Engineer: https://careers.polarsteps.com/vacancies/e4743023-85f2-4a34-...\n\nSnyk | https://snyk.io/ | Software Engineer, Senior Software Engineer, Engineering Manager | Full Time | Boston, MA or London, UK | Onsite / Hybrid\n\nAbout Snyk: Every day, the world gets more digital thanks to tens of millions of developers building the future faster than ever.

Snyk is on a mission to make the world a more secure place by empowering developers to develop fast and stay secure.\n\nAs an Engineer at Snyk, you'll be at the forefront of building the future of application security. You’ll be challenged to create high-performance, reliable, and scalable services while collaborating closely with cross-functional teams. We’re looking for individuals who are passionate about crafting exceptional software, solving complex problems, and driving innovation.\n\nAs a part of our Developer Experience team you’ll have the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects, from mastering existing services to building new, cutting-edge features. Your contributions will directly impact the success of our product and the security of millions of developers worldwide.\n\nYou can find this and all of our software engineering job openings here: https://snyk.io/careers/all-jobs/?department=4051349002\n\nSecure your future.

We are building the google-maps of education - the only edtech where we bring a focused, standardized, digital approach to CS higher education. I speak about this on this podcast (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be1yEJbyEkQ).\n\nHere's 3 cool things we've done:\n\n1. 100% AI based evaluators in B.Tech CS 4 year program.\n\n2. Launched our full-fledged program in 20+ universities in India, where students are placed from 3rd semester onwards. This year we've had more premium universities signup: SRM, VIT, Christ, etc.\n\n3. Solid business fundamentals - sustainability in every classroom with our revenue.\n\nTo align you to our approach: we seek out engineers who want to involve with this problem statements. Edtech v1.0 in India does not have a good rep (tell me about it!), but the problem statements remains: higher education system is broken, and not giving students the outcomes they are capable of (Here's the outcomes we deliver - https://kalvium.com/hire-from-us/).\n\nOur main realization is: we can't rely on people to drive a significant change, rather it has to be a system which builds and uplifts skills in students. That's what we've built and launched in above universities (https://kalvium.com/heros/). We have a 12 year roadmap! it's a blue ocean, and we want to build and lead Edtech V2.0.\n\nNote on team/compensation: We plan on being a small core team that geeks out on learning and platform-izing it! Our pay is commensurate to experience with meaningful equity. We plan for a 4 year path of growth for every individual in our team. If this sounds like a meaningful challenge and place to build your career, please reach out to me via anil@kalvium.com with your resume.\n\nE9 Genomics | Founding Software Engineer / Founding Data Engineer | Cambridge, MA (ONSITE 2-3 days/week)\n\nE9 Genomics (https://e9genomics.com) is hiring a few great engineers to join us on a mission to organize the world's biological information and make the complex, enormous world of biological data feel small and accessible.

We've seen firsthand how the ability to explore biological data in real time doesn't just let scientists answer the same questions faster, but rather leads to fundamentally different questions and a new level of understanding. We also know from experience that the tools from the tech industry often don't translate well to biology, and that we need to be fearless in adapting or rebuilding whatever is necessary to get the job done.\n\nWe're backed by an incredible set of investors and angels, including Jeff Dean, and we're excited to have the chance to build some awesome & impactful technology with some awesome people.\n\nEmail me to learn more: tim@\n\n[1] https://github.com/hail-is/hail [2] https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/\n\nLightning Labs | Senior Engineering Manager, Lightning Protocol Engineer, Senior Security Engineer| San Francisco | Remote | Full-time\n\nhttps://lightning.engineering/join-us\n\nhttps://github.com/lightninglabs\n\nLightning Labs is hiring!

We now host the largest collection of open source computer vision datasets and pre-trained models[2]. We are pushing forward the CV ecosystem with open source projects like Autodistill[3] and Supervision[4]. And we've built one of the most comprehensive resources for software engineers to learn to use computer vision with our popular blog[5] and YouTube channel[6].\n\nWe have several openings available but are primarily looking for strong technical generalists who want to help us democratize computer vision and like to wear many hats and have an outsized impact. Our engineering culture is built on a foundation of autonomy & we don't consider an engineer fully ramped until they can \"choose their own loss function\". At Roboflow, engineers aren't just responsible for building things but also for helping us figure out what we should build next. We're builders & problem solvers; not just coders. (For this reason we also especially love hiring past and future founders.)\n\nWe're currently hiring full-stack engineers for our ML and web platform teams, a web developer to bridge our product and marketing teams, several technical roles on the sales & field engineering teams, and our first applied machine learning researcher to help push forward the state of the art in computer vision.\n\n[1]: https://roboflow.com/?ref=whoishiring1024\n\n[2]: https://roboflow.com/universe?ref=whoishiring1024\n\n[3]: https://github.com/autodistill/autodistill\n\n[4]: https://github.com/roboflow/supervision\n\n[5]: https://blog.roboflow.com/?ref=whoishiring1024\n\n[6]: https://www.youtube.com/@Roboflow\n\nMixRank (YC S11) | Software Engineers | 100% REMOTE (Global) | Full-Time\n\nMixRank processes petabytes of data every month from web crawling. We have hundreds of customers using our data products including Google, Amazon, Facebook, Intel, and Adobe, across industries including Finance, Recruiting, Sales, Marketing, and Security.\n\nWe’re a fully-remote company with a global footprint in over 20 countries. We're growing, profitable, employee-owned, no dependence on outside funding. Applicants from all geographies and backgrounds are welcome.\n\nWe are looking for passionate individuals for whom programming is not just a job but it’s something they love to do. We're obsessed with computers, programming, big data, databases, compilers, hardware, math, data science, and the internet. Does this sound like you? Please apply to join our team.\n\nOur code base is very friendly to new contributors. You'll have a fully-functional development environment within hours (fully automated) and be pushing commits on your first day. Deployments to production happen multiple times per day and finish in less than 2 minutes. Effectively all of our codebase is written in Python, Rust, SQL, Javascript/TypeScript, and Nix. The core technologies you'll need familiarity with to be productive are Python, PostgreSQL, Linux, and Git.\n\nWe operate at a larger scale than typical startups. We operate two datacenters with high performance servers we've built that are capable of dealing with the volumes of data we process. We've implemented our own distributed file system. We do full-scale web crawls. We download and perform static analysis on the entire universe of Android APKs and iOS IPAs that are published. Unlike a typical startup where you'll spend half of your time in meetings, and the other half fixing bugs from Jira tickets— at MixRank you'll get to challenge yourself with difficult technical problems that will help you to grow as an individual.\n\nWe're hiring continuously for the positions below— they aren't singular positions that will close once filled. Our philosophy on hiring is that the candidate is more important than the position. For each new member of the team, we design a custom role and responsibilities that are specialized to their interests. Other companies will come up with a long list of specific requirements for a position with the expectation that you'll exactly replace someone from the team, or that you'll be the perfect tetris piece that satisfies the job requirements decided by a committee. MixRank is more pragmatic: we'll first get excited about having a unique individual on the team, then we'll figure out the best way to accommodate their specific talents.\n\n--\n\nJunior Software Engineer - Remote (Global), Full-Time\n\nWe're looking for remote junior engineers that have 0-3 years of professional experience in software, and 5+ years of curiosity exploring computers, programming, and technical hobby projects.

To stand out, please highlight what makes you unique: passion for computing, curiosity and side projects, work ethic, niche research, etc.\n\nIdeally you've already graduated, but if you still have one or more years left of school, please feel free to apply anyway, and if you're the right fit for the team we'll figure out a way to accommodate your schedule.\n\n--\n\nSoftware Engineer - Remote (Global), Full-Time\n\nWe're hiring generalist software engineers to work on web applications, data mining, machine learning/data science, data transformation/ETL, data modeling, database scaling, infrastructure, devops, and more.

If you don't see a relevant position open, reach out to jobs at mixrank.com.

We're looking for backend developers who like doing DevOps'y stuff sometimes (because in a way it's the spirit of our company), or have experience with the cloud native ecosystem. Ideally you'd have experience working with an IaC tool, i.e. Terraform, Pulumi, Ansible, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, or SaltStack.\n\nOverall we have a deeply technical product, trying to build something customers love to use, and already have a lot of happy and satisfied customers. We promise interesting work, the ability to open source parts of the project which don't give us a business advantage, as well as healthy working hours. We've also got investment days on Fridays, when you can work on anything you want, as long as it could possibly benefit Spacelift in some way.\n\nIf that sounds like fun to you, please apply at https://spacelift.teamtailor.com/jobs/3006934-software-engin...\n\nYou can find out more about the product we're building at https://spacelift.io and also see our engineering blog for a few technical blog posts of ours: https://spacelift.io/blog/engineering\n\nFullstory | Atlanta or Remote (USA) | https://www.fullstory.com/\n\nFullstory provides session replay and analytics for websites and mobile apps.

After raising a seed round from top-tier investors just over a year ago, we launched a first version of our service in several states. Customer feedback has been enthusiastic (NPS hovering above 80) and unit economics look good, so we are working to scale the service and make it available nationwide by early 2025. You won’t find much about us online yet, but we’ll share our story more publicly soon.\n\nWe're looking for engineers who are excited about building a seamless and beautiful consumer healthcare product. We care deeply about technical excellence but also move quickly. We don’t expect you to have a healthcare background (though it’s great if you do!), but you should be excited by the prospect of digging into the messy complexities of the American healthcare system (navigating price transparency data from payers, integrating with EHRs, medical billing, provider credentialing, etc).\n\nIf that sounds exciting to you, email me at noah@nile.health\n\nONSITE in Prague, Czech Republic\n\nLinux C++ Engineer for Camera Development\n\nMosaic is seeking an experienced Linux C++ developer to assist our team in developing advanced industrial 360º camera systems.

It is possible to work with us either as a contractor or as a full-time employee. Either way, you will be a crucial part of our small team, building foundations for products that will be used for years to come.

We’re a remote-first team of 35 people across North America. We’re growing and very profitable, and we have customers that love our product. We’re currently in the goldilocks zone of having product market fit with real revenue but also a really flat hierarchy where you can ship fast.\n\nWe want to accelerate product delivery (there’s so much to build!) so we’re looking to bring on high agency and experienced frontend engineers to work on high impact product features / frontend infrastructure. We’re building a small, focused, high performing frontend engineering team that works directly with the CEO leading the product. To help build this great team, we offer incredibly competitive compensation (based on Bay Area bands) and some interesting benefits(https://www.streak.com/careers#benefits). We want you to do the best work of your career here, so you should expect high autonomy and ownership.\n\nLastly, we believe the traditional interview process isn’t well correlated with an engineers’ ability to ship product. Instead, our interview process mimics what it’s actually like to work here. It’s highly asynchronous, favors writing and involves building something useful. We think this will give you a really good insight into our team and company and of course lets us assess if you’ll thrive here.\n\nSenior React Engineer | Ping Data Intelligence | ONSITE (Miami) or REMOTE | Full-Time | https://www.pingintel.com/\n\nPing Data Intelligence is a dynamic, three-year-old startup in Miami, FL, revolutionizing the property insurance sector with cutting-edge web technologies.
