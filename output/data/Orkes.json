It’s designed to give you a comprehensive environment for prototyping workflows, exploring platform capabilities, and evaluating how Orkes fits your use case. While not suitable for production, it provides a powerful starting point to build, test, and iterate before scaling to Enterprise.\n\nThe Developer Playground is designed for individual developers to explore Orkes Conductor, test concepts, and get familiar with its capabilities. It is not intended or recommended for production use—particularly for enterprise-scale workloads—due to the lack of a service level agreement (SLA), limited scalability, and variable performance. Rate limits and available resources may change at any time, making it unsuitable for production environments where stability and predictability are essential.\n\nFor production-grade use cases with guaranteed performance, support, and scalability, we recommend upgrading to the Enterprise plan.",

Async communication is better because it will improve the availability\n\nLets sey system \"A\" has 99.9% of availability and system \"B\" has 99.5%.\n\nIf \"A\" communicate with \"B\" in a sync way the hole availability drops to almost 99.4%(99.9 \\* 99.5). This problem will scale as the application scales and more communications appears. Even that a ms goes down the entire system will die.\n\nAsync communication solves this problem but the application gets harder at the engeneering level but this is microservices!!! Very hard to do right.\n\nFor async communication AMQP is a good protocol you can chose RabbitMQ(simple option) or your favorit cloud message bus. Kafka is the bigger player.\n\nSync communication is not wrong but be carefull as u/MartzReddit has said it is a \"bad smell\". If you are being forced to sync too much it is a sign that your bounded context is wrong and maybe you should merge these two microservices that are heavely coupled.\n\nAbout the IP resolution:\n\nWe are using DNS to resolve IPs at Convenia. All microservices has a complete and isolated stack with its own DNS name. They call each other by name.\n\nDNS is an option but if you are sunning inside a cloud they have service discovery options too. Like CloudMap inside AWS. It has a good integration with ECS(better option to run docker containers inside aws).\n\nBut if you are communicating in an async way you dont have to know the names of the services you just need to know the message broker address.\n\nAt the end we always end with a mix od sync and async communication :/\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry about my crappy english.\n\n### Comment ID j75cb74 with +2 score by [(Wrecking_Bull, Reddit, 2023-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/microservices/comments/10sfhrc/communication_between_microservices_issue/j75cb74/) (in reply to ID j71o9wk):\nYou really have to look at Orkes.io and apply similar event driven architecture/ saga pattern for that\n\n### Comment ID j747q2w with +1 score by [(MaximFateev, Reddit, 2023-02-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/microservices/comments/10sfhrc/communication_between_microservices_issue/j747q2w/) (in reply to ID j71o9wk):\nLook at [temporal.io](https://temporal.io) for async service communication.

And Users have Orders - but Order functionality is handled entirely by an Order microservice, which has an independent DB.\n\nNow, in the Order data model, there will be a \"userId\" which references the User's id.  But it isn't actually a foreign key, because the User entity doesn't even exist in the Order database.\n\nAm I thinking about this correctly?  Is there an answer?  I was thinking that to impose more \"strictness\" to the microservice database, that a User relation could exist on the Order database with nothing other than the PK, and then the Order relation COULD reference the Order DB's User.\n\nAnd it could be that I'm just not thinking about this problem correctly at all - or I'm overthinking it!  I would love to receive some feedback/thoughts.  Thank you.\n\n\\*\\* The microservice will represent  considerably more data than the microservice's client (the primary application).

I answered a question similar to this on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58517773/how-to-manage-many-to-many-relations-in-microservices-architecture/58524143#58524143) \\- you might find that helpful.  It *feels* wrong in the beginning, but in practice it works quite well.\n\nHere's the text of that answer.  Their example was similar except Employees and Departments rather than Users and Orders.  So, most of the jist of it holds true - see the actual answer for some helpful links on key points also:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Assuming you have your domains modeled properly, this seems like an easy fix with Integration Events.  \n>  \n>Add an EmployeeIds table to your Departments Service and a DepartmentIds table to your Employees service. When you make, break, or change an assignment between an Employee and a Department, publish a EmployeeDepartmentUpdated event that both services subscribe to. Then, each service can process the event and update their own data to keep in sync.  \n>  \n>You do NOT want to start putting data into your gateway API, that's not what it's for (and it means that if you have multiple gateways to the same back-end services, only one will know that information).  \n>  \n>Embrace Eventual Consistency and your microservices journey will be the better for it!  \n>  \n>EDIT:  \n>  \n>To your question about the impact of Events on performance and complexity, the answers are \"no\" and \"yes.\"  \n>  \n>First, no I would not expect event-sourcing to have a negative impact on system performance. In fact, their asynchronous nature makes event processing a separate concern from API responsiveness.  \n>  \n>I'm sure there are ways to build a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA, of which microservices is essentially a subset) without a messaging plane, but in my experience having one is a fantastic way to let loosely-coupled communication happen.  \n>  \n>Any direct calls between services - regardless of protocol (HTTP, gRPC, etc.) means tight coupling between those services. Endpoint names, arguments, etc. are all opportunities for breaking changes. When you use messaging, each service is responsible for emitting backward-compatible events and every other service can choose which events it cares about, subscribe to them, and never have any knowledge of whether the emitting service is running, dead, changed, etc.  \n>  \n>To your second question, the answer is absolutely \"yes\" - event processing is additional complexity. However, it's part of the complexity you sign up for (and far from the worst of it) when you choose a microservices architecture style. Distributed authorization, keeping UI performant with multiple back-end calls organized between multiple services, fault tolerance and health/performance monitoring are all (at least in my experience) bigger challenges.  \n>  \n>For the record, we use a hosted instance of RabbitMQ from CloudAMQP.com and it works great. Performance is good, they have lots of scalable packages to choose from, and we've had zero issues with performance or downtime. The latest RabbitMQ 3.8 release now includes OAuth as well so we are currently working to integrate our Authz flows with our message broker and will have a nice end-to-end security solution.\n\n### Comment ID j33y80c with +1 score by [(rukind_cucumber, Reddit, 2023-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/microservices/comments/1048r1k/question_about_microservices_db_data_relations/j33y80c/) (in reply to ID j33u43b):\nGreat response - thanks.  Your response really seems to get at the idea of consistency, and the integration events idea was a good one.\n\nJust so I'm clear, this wouldn't really be needed if there's no need to know the relationship one way - right?\n\nWhat I mean is that, in the question you answered, the relation was M:N, and you might want to query Employees by Department or Departments by Employee.\n\nBut in a 1:M relation, (say User to Order), don't you think it could be sufficient to put the UserId table on the Order service DB?\n\nTo elucidate a little further with my use case, essentially the Order service is a CRUD app for User Orders.  The only functionality is essentially:\n\n* RETRIEVE User's Orders\n* CREATE Order\n* UPDATE Order\n* DELETE Order\n\nThere's actually some layering going on (Order hasMany Items, for instance), but it's not material to the conversation and question at hand.\n\nWhen I go and retrieve the User's Orders, I won't ever need just a list of Order Numbers - so that's why Io'm wondering if the idea of the OrderId table on the User's DB & the integration events might be overkill in my case.

In that case, may be perfectly fine to have a foreign key table on only one side.  It's (probably) important to keep in mind, though, that regardless of exactly where and how you persist your data, it's very likely you'll want two-way communication through the message bus between the services.  To your example: Order service gets an update from Payment service that payment was approved, so it publishes an \"order\\_approved\" message that the User service sees and publishes its own \"send\\_user\\_email\" message that the Email service sees.\n\nMain reason I shared this response is that it took me a long time to start thinking about data in an event-driven way.

Lets say it contains an *Order* table, but also a *User* table. Joins can still be performed in the expected way, and it can be ACID compliant, use transactions etc, but the scope is limited to just within the OrderService.\n\nSo how do we populate the OrderService with User information?\n\nA Customer will sign up using the UserService API, where an account is created, they confirm their email address and they login. When the User account is created, the UserService publishes an event to an Event Bus of some kind. The event will contain meta data, in the instance of a *User Created* event it might be { id, username, email, name, address: {}, ... }\n\nThe Event Bus **is** shared between all services - it's what loosely couples services together.\n\nAny Service which is connected to the Event Bus can subscribe to events they are interested in, such as the *User Created* event. When the OrderService subscribes to the *User Created* event, it can then create a new User in its local *User* table using the meta data from the event payload.\n\nThe OrderService has no awareness of the UserService and is not tight coupling to the UserService, and vice verse... the UserService is not tightly coupled to the OrderService and has no awareness of it, it's APIs or depends on it being online.\n\nIf the UserService goes down, it's still possible to place an Order and checkout. Each service can use the most suitable database based on its requirements, the teams knowledge, cost, etc.\n\nSo now the OrderService can query the database in simple terms, and developers are also not having to perform complex weird queries over multiple database, avoiding querying lots of APIs and smudging payloads together, etc. \n\nThere has to be some constraints. We would consider the User model to be a first class citizen of the UserService only. So the OrderService would not have an API which allows for a User to be deleted and a *User Deleted* event to be published to the Event Hub. The UserService wouldn't be subscribed to that anyway, but other services may be. This is the only contract that development teams need to maintain, which is the first class citizenship scope of their entities.\n\nThe Microservices and a database per service pattern lead to an intentional duplication of the data across Microservices, with the benefit of data redundancy, performance and scalability.\n\n## Comment ID j33n2z1 with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/microservices/comments/1048r1k/question_about_microservices_db_data_relations/j33n2z1/) (in reply to ID 1048r1k):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID j6v8waq with +1 score by [(Wrecking_Bull, Reddit, 2023-02-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/microservices/comments/1048r1k/question_about_microservices_db_data_relations/j6v8waq/) (in reply to ID j33n2z1):\nHave you guys tried out event driven orchestration at https:// play.orkes.io\nEnterprise version of Netflix conductor from its original creators",

At this time, I have:\n\n  \n\\- **UDP** for unrealiable short messaging. Fast, fire and forget for messages that could experience a high rate of loss, dupes or desequencing with no impact on the application.\n\n\\- **ZMQ** for most other inter-component communication where UDP doesn't fit for whatever reason.\n\n\\- **MySQL** queue for the most important stuff that must survive software crashes, reboots, has dupe protection, and so on.\n\n\\- **Shared memory / signals** for communication between websocket daemons and workers on the same server\n\n\n\n  \nIt does work great, except for the fact that I do not like the complexity of it. It's simply a lot of code to make it all work seamlessly, loosely coupled AND be strongly scalable. A lot of code means a lot of code to maintain.\n\n\n\nI am also not so happy with ZMQ and PHP as far as long-running background services are concerned. Rare, almost impossible to reproduce and debug memory leaks are an issue that I spent inordinate amount of time chasing and ended up writing a NodeJS proxy that takes dealing with \\*receiving\\* ZMQ in long-running services out of PHP. This fixed the problem but added even more complexity and dependencies.\n\n  \nI'm also not so happy with how ZMQ can be brutal about failure detection and recovery. I need to be able, for example, to decide whether or not component X should try to contact component Y - is the component Y online, ready to receive messages, not too overloaded? Did we send the component Y a bunch of messages that they did not acknowledge lately? That kind of stuff.\n\n  \nI am wondering if there's a system that could simply replace it all. I'm looking to replace all of the 4 ways of communication with something generic, simple and - important - not maintained by me, while retaining performance, scalability and reliability where it applies.\n\nI am reading up on RabbitMQ and liking what I see. But maybe you guys can share some of your experiences, considering the use cases I outlined above.\n\n  \nThe other way I'm considering is to simply write something myself that would unify all communication methods in some way, but since I have a strong and proven track record of reinventing wheels, I thought I'd ask first.\n\n  \nThanks!\n\n## Comment ID lx28rxm with +62 score by [(_MrFade_, Reddit, 2024-11-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/1gr0uon/picking_the_right_message_queue_system_for_php/lx28rxm/) (in reply to ID 1gr0uon):\nSpeaking from personal experience I recommend giving RabbitMQ a try.\n\n### Comment ID lx2cmi6 with +14 score by [(Naan-Khatai, Reddit, 2024-11-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/1gr0uon/picking_the_right_message_queue_system_for_php/lx2cmi6/) (in reply to ID lx28rxm):\n![gif](giphy|elUGwgiPOdq7e|downsized)\n\nOne broker to queue them all.

Small support, missing , unstable and immature libraries. In the past two years i've dealt with BealstalkD RabbitMQ, LavinMQ, and [NATS.io](http://NATS.io) , and all of them are problematic ( at least for our use case )  \nBeanstalkD - fast when publishing, fast when consuming, slow when doing both at the same time. No replication, no clustering.   \nRabbitMQ - decent performance, but does not support delayed messages natively and the plugin fails with milions of messages\n\nLavinMQ - Great Alternative to rabbitmq, quite faster, native delayed messages, but cannot be clustered. They have replication and automatic fail-over over etcd.\n\nThe go-to amqp library as a whole is old fashioned and i guess it has some performance bottlenecks ( never have i measured it though ) , bunny is better but still immature.\n\n[NATS.io](http://NATS.io) \\- great platform, lots of possibilities, quite fast, but the one and only working library is not officially supported, tightly coupled, and generally not on par with libraries for other languages. Unfortunately, internally we decided to use NATS and we struggle every day with some issues around the implementation.\n\n### Comment ID lxbpbfd with +2 score by [(evnix, Reddit, 2024-11-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/1gr0uon/picking_the_right_message_queue_system_for_php/lxbpbfd/) (in reply to ID lx2jvur):\n\\+1 for NATS, I think NATS is pretty much going to replace RabbitMQ and Kafka in the long run, incredibly well designed, light weight.

Don't save to disk. When it goes down, all data is gone\n2. Appendonly This creates a file on disk and every transaction (command) you push to redis is saved there. So it's a 1:1 copy of the database and on every start of redis, it reads through the appendonly file and recreates the database as it was before. This file gets huge over time\n3. (the default currently) snapshot saves. You can configure how often the database is snapshotted to the disk. Only saves current state of the DB so it's pretty small and starts quickly. You can choose if the snapshot is done after X transactions or X minutes or both\n\n\nAlso remember you can cluster the redis servers so if you have 2 or 3 you can lose one without losing data\n\n## Comment ID lx2y82u with +2 score by [(Antsplace, Reddit, 2024-11-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/1gr0uon/picking_the_right_message_queue_system_for_php/lx2y82u/) (in reply to ID 1gr0uon):\nI would support others saying give RabbitMQ a try, or as an alternative look at temporal.\n\n## Comment ID lxgj7sn with +2 score by [(ryantxr, Reddit, 2024-11-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/1gr0uon/picking_the_right_message_queue_system_for_php/lxgj7sn/) (in reply to ID 1gr0uon):\nRabbit, redis, Kafka, BeanstalkD.

Run the pub/sub system whenever its necessary then shut it down and run it again with supervisor.

      "# [RAG Explained | Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation to Build Semantic Search](https://orkes.io/blog/rag-explained-building-semantic-search/)\nLarge language models (LLMs) have captured the public sphere of imagination in the past few years since OpenAI first launched ChatGPT to the world in late 2022. After the initial fascination amongst the public, businesses followed suit to find use cases where they could potentially deploy LLMs.\n\nWith more and more LLMs released as open source and deployable as on-premise private models, it became possible for organizations to train, fine-tune, or supplement models with private data. RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) is one such technique for customizing an LLM, serving as a viable approach for businesses to use LLMs without the high costs and specialized skills involved in building a custom model from scratch.\n\nWhat is retrieval-augmented generation?\n\nRAG (retrieval-augmented generation) is a technique that improves the accuracy of an LLM (large language model) output with pre-fetched data from external sources. With RAG, the model references a separate database from its training data in real-time before generating a response.\n\nRAG extends the general capabilities of LLMs into a specific domain without the need to train a custom model from scratch. This approach enables general-purpose LLMs to provide more useful, relevant, and accurate answers in highly-specialized or private contexts, such as an organization’s internal knowledge base. For most use cases, RAG provides a similar result as training custom models but at a fraction of the required cost and resources.\n\nHow does retrieval-augmented generation work?\n\nRAG involves using general-purpose LLMs as-is without special training or fine-tuning to serve answers based on domain-specific knowledge. This is achieved using a two-part process.\n\nFirst, the data is chunked and transformed into embeddings, which are vector representations of the data. These embeddings are then indexed into a vector database with the help of an AI algorithm known as embedding models.\n\nOnce the data is populated in the index, natural language queries can be performed on the index using the same embedding model to yield relevant chunks of information. These chunks then get passed to the LLM as context, along with guardrails and prompts on how to respond given the context.\n\nWhy use retrieval-augmented generation?\n\nRAG offers several strategic advantages when implementing generative AI capabilities:\n\nMinimize inaccuracies\n\nUsing a RAG-based LLM can help reduce hallucinations (plausible yet completely false information) or inaccuracies in the model’s answers. By providing access to additional information, RAG enables relevant context to be added to the LLM prompt, thus leveraging the power of in-context learning (ICL) to improve the reliability of the model’s answers.\n\nAccess to latest information\n\nWith access to a continuously updated external database, the LLM can provide the latest information in news, social media, research, and other sources. RAG ensures that the LLM responses are up-to-date, relevant, and credible, even if the model’s training data does not contain the latest information.\n\nCost-effective, scalable, and flexible\n\nRAG requires much less time and specialized skills, tooling, or infrastructure to obtain a production-ready LLM. Furthermore, by changing the data source or updating the database, the LLM can be efficiently modified without any retraining, making RAG an ideal approach at scale.\n\nSince RAG makes use of general-purpose LLMs, the model is decoupled from the domain, enabling developers to switch up the model at will. Compared to a custom pre-trained model, RAG provides instant, low-cost upgrades from one LLM to another.\n\nHighly inspectable architecture\n\nRAG offers a highly inspectable architecture, so developers can examine the user input, the retrieved context, and the LLM response to identify any discrepancies. With this ease of visibility, RAG-powered LLMs can also be instructed to provide sources in their responses, establishing more credibility and transparency with users.\n\nHow to use retrieval-augmented generation?\n\nRAG can be used for various knowledge-intensive tasks:\n\nQuestion-answering systems\n\nKnowledge base search engine\n\nDocument retrieval for research\n\nRecommendation systems\n\nChatbots with real-time data\n\nBuilding a retrieval-augmented generation system\n\nWhile the barriers to entry into RAG are much lower, it still requires an understanding of LLM concepts, as well as trained developers and engineers who can build data pipelines and integrate the query toolchain into the required services for consumption.\n\nUsing workflow orchestration as a means to build RAG-based applications levels the playing field to that of anyone who can string together API calls to form a business process. The two-part process described above can be built as two workflows to create a RAG-based application. Let's build a financial news analysis platform in this example.\n\nOrchestrating RAG using Orkes Conductor\n\nOrkes Conductor streamlines the process of building LLM-powered applications by orchestrating the interaction between distributed components so that you don’t have to write the plumbing or infrastructure code for it. In this case, a RAG system requires orchestration between four key components:\n\nAggregating data from a data source;\n\nIndexing and retrieving the data in a vector database\n\nUsing an embedding model; and\n\nIntegrating and calling the LLM to respond to a search query.\n\nLet's build out the workflows to orchestrate the interaction between these components.\n\nPart 1: Indexing the data\n\nThe first part of creating a RAG system is to load, clean, and index the data. This process can be accomplished with a Conductor workflow. Let’s build a data-indexer workflow.\n\nStep 1: Get the data\n\nChoose a data source for your RAG system. The data can come from anywhere — a document repository, database, or API — and Conductor offers a variety of tasks that can pull data from any source.\n\nFor our financial news analysis platform, the FMP Articles API will serve as the data source. To call the API, get the API access keys and create an HTTP task in your Conductor workflow. Configure the endpoint method, URL, and other settings, and the task will retrieve data through the API whenever the workflow is executed.\n\nStep 2: Transform the data\n\nBefore the data gets indexed to the vector database, the API payload should be transformed, cleaned, and chunked so that the embedding model can ingest it.\n\nDevelopers can write Conductor workers to transform the data to create chunks. Conductor workers are powerful, language-agnostic functions that can be written in any language and use well-known libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and so on for advanced data transformation and cleaning.\n\nIn our example, we will use a JSON JQ Transform Task as a simple demonstration of how to transform the data. We only need the article title and content from the FMP Articles API for our financial news analysis platform. Each article must be stored in separate chunks in the required payload format for indexing.\n\nStep 3: Index the data into a vector database\n\nThe cleaned data is now ready to be indexed into a vector database, such as Pinecone, Weaviate, MongoDB, and more. Use the LLM Index Text Task in your Conductor workflow to add one data chunk into the vector space. A dynamic fork can be used to execute multiple LLM Index Text Tasks in parallel so that multiple chunks can be added at once.\n\nThe LLM Index Test Task is one of the many LLM tasks provided in Orkes Conductor to simplify building LLM-powered applications.\n\nRepeat\n\nTo build out the vector database, iterate through the three steps — extract, transform, load — until the desired dataset size is reached. The iterative loop can be built using a Do While operator task in Conductor.\n\nHere is the full data-indexer workflow.\n\nPart 2: Retrieving data for semantic search\n\nOnce the vector database is ready, it can be deployed for production — in this case, for financial news analysis. This is where data is retrieved from the vector database to serve as context for the LLM, so that it can formulate a more accurate response. For this second part, let’s build a semantic-search workflow that can be used in an application.\n\nStep 1: Retrieve relevant data from vector database\n\nIn a new workflow, add the LLM Search Index Task — one of the many LLM tasks provided in Orkes Conductor to simplify building LLM-powered applications. This task takes in a user query and returns the relevant context chunks that match the most closely.\n\nStep 2: Formulate an answer\n\nWith the retrieved context, call an LLM of your choice to generate the response to the user query. Use the LLM Text Complete Task in Orkes Conductor to accomplish this step. The LLM will ingest the user query along with the context.\n\nGuardrails can be set up in Orkes Conductor to optimize and constrain the LLM response, such as by adjusting the temperature, topP, or maxTokens.\n\nUse Orkes Conductor’s AI Prompt studio to create a prompt template for the LLM to follow in the LLM Text Complete Task.\n\nExample prompt template\n\nAnswer the question based on the context provided. Context: \"${context}\" Question: \"${question}\" Provide just the answer without repeating the question or mentioning the context.\n\nHere is the full semantic-search workflow.\n\nUse the workflow in your application\n\nOnce the semantic-search workflow is ready, you can use it in your application project to build a semantic search engine or chatbot. To build your application, leverage the Conductor SDKs, available in popular languages like Python, Java, and Golang, and call our APIs to trigger the workflow in your application.\n\nThe RAG-based financial news analysis platform looks like this:\n\nWhenever a user enters a query, a semantic-search workflow runs in the background to provide the answer.\n\nIf the vector database needs to be updated on the backend, the data-indexer workflow can be triggered, or even scheduled at regular intervals for automatic updates.\n\nWhile the financial news analysis platform is a simple variant of a RAG system, developers can use Orkes Conductor to quickly develop and debug their own RAG systems of varying complexities.\n\nSummary\n\nBuilding semantic search using RAG can be much more achievable than most people think. By applying orchestration using a platform like Orkes Conductor, the development and operational effort need not involve complicated tooling, infrastructure, skill sets and other resources. This translates to a highly efficient go-to-market process that can be rapidly iterated over time to optimize the results and value derived from such AI capabilities in any modern business.\n\n—",

      "# [Announcing the New Conductor Java Client v4](https://orkes.io/blog/conductor-java-client-v4/)\nEarlier this year, Python SDK had a major facelift. Now other Conductor SDKs are undergoing significant rehaul, and we are thrilled to announce Java Client v4, featuring significant design enhancements, performance improvements, and optimized dependencies.\n\nIn our Java Client v4, we’ve reduced the dependency footprint by improving its design. We’ve added filters, events, and listeners to remove direct dependencies. This design decision was made after careful consideration to make the client easier to use, extend, and maintain.\n\nRead on to learn more!\n\nWhy are we doing this?\n\nWe’ve heard your feedback and are working to improve the developer experience. Orkes and the Conductor OSS community were managing two separate Java client/SDK projects, both of which, like many in our industry, had accumulated some technical debt. We decided it was the right time to address this debt.\n\nSome of the key things we wanted to address immediately were:\n\nOne Conductor Java client (to rule them all)\n\nThe goal was to consolidate the two existing projects into a unified, more manageable solution, taking the strongest elements from each. This should translate into faster updates, better support, and a more cohesive development experience.\n\nDependency optimization\n\nAs part of code cleanup, we’ve removed several dependencies:\n\nDependencies on backend code—The previous OSS Java client and SDK projects were part of the Conductor OSS repo and depended on conductor-commons. Although this kept the backend/client models in sync, it also meant some backend-related code and dependencies were leaking to the client.\n\nDependencies on deprecated artifacts.\n\nDependencies on stuff you won’t be needing.\n\nBy removing hard-coded dependencies, users and contributors can extend the client without being locked into specific libraries or tools.\n\nMore modularity\n\nWe’ve restructured the project to increase modularity, making the client more flexible and easier to customize.\n\nWith this modular approach, you can integrate your preferred monitoring, logging, or discovery tools through events, listeners, and filters. This not only simplifies customization but also makes the codebase more maintainable and future-proof, empowering developers to build and scale their own extensions as needed.\n\nCode cleanup/refactoring\n\nWith a cleaner codebase, future development should be faster and less error-prone, making it easier for community contributions as well.\n\nBetter examples\n\nWe've introduced a module within the project specifically for examples. While it's still a work in progress, this module will serve as a central resource for practical, real-world examples whether you're getting started or looking for advanced use cases.\n\nHome, sweet home\n\nOfficial Conductor Client and SDKs are currently housed in https://github.com/conductor-sdk, with the exception of the OSS Java Client/SDK, which is part of the Conductor OSS repo https://github.com/orkes-io/orkes-conductor-client/tree/main.\n\nGoing forward, all Conductor Clients and SDKs will eventually be housed in the same conductor-clients directory in the conductor-oss/conductor repo. Head there to find the source code for the Java Client/SDK v4.\n\nWhat’s new in Java Client v4?\n\n1. Optimized dependencies\n\nJava Client v4 introduces a more streamlined and efficient dependency set compared to the two projects it replaces.\n\nWe’ve removed all unused, deprecated, and unnecessary dependencies, significantly reducing classpath pollution. This optimization not only minimizes the risk of conflicts between libraries but should also improve overall performance and maintainability. By simplifying the dependency tree, v4 provides a cleaner and more lightweight client that is easier to work with and integrates more smoothly into your projects.\n\n2. New TaskRunner\n\nTaskRunner has been refactored. It replaces TaskPollExecutor, since both share the same core responsibility: managing the thread pool that workers use for polling, executing, and updating tasks.\n\nWith that, we've removed direct dependencies on Netflix Eureka and Spectator, introduced event-driven mechanisms, and added a PollFilter—a callback that determines whether polling should occur. Additionally, error handling and concurrency management have been improved.\n\nIf you’re using Eureka and Spectator, no need to worry—events and filters are provided for seamless integration with these great tools and libraries.\n\n3. Extensibility using events, listeners, and filters\n\nJava Client v4 introduces enhanced extensibility through events, listeners, and filters. These can be used for various purposes, including metrics tracking, logging, auditing, and triggering custom actions based on specific conditions.\n\nFor example, you can use a Lambda Function as a PollFilter to check the instance status as reported by Eureka. If the instance is marked as UP—meaning Eureka considers it healthy and available—the worker will proceed to poll for tasks.\n\nAdditionally, a listener can be registered to handle PollCompleted events. In this scenario, the listener logs event details and uses Prometheus to track the duration of the polling process, attaching the task type as a label for detailed metrics tracking. This approach not only adds flexibility but also improves observability and control over the client's behavior.\n\nThe client also has some specialized interfaces like MetricsCollector, which is built on top of these events and listeners. We’ll be providing concrete implementations of Metrics Collectors soon.\n\n4. OkHttp3 v4 — the right amount of features OOTB\n\nOkHttp3 v4 is one of the most popular and well-regarded HTTP clients for Java. By upgrading to it, our Java Client/SDK v4 now supports HTTP2 and Gzip out-of-the-box, allowing you to make swifter HTTP requests or data transfers. While there are other excellent options, OkHTTP was chosen for its simplicity, performance, and reliability.\n\nWith the OkHttp upgrade, we also decided to remove one abstraction layer, Jersey. Jersey is more feature-rich but also more heavyweight compared to a simple HTTP client like OkHttp. Some of these features (such as dependency injection and exception mappers) can be overkill if you just want to make basic HTTP requests.\n\n5. Ease of migration from OSS to Orkes\n\nThe client promotes seamless integration between OSS Conductor and Orkes Conductor, empowering users with the flexibility to switch as their needs evolve, while maintaining support for the open-source community first.\n\nThe Orkes Client module simply extends the Conductor Client by adding authentication through a HeaderSupplier.\n\nFor OSS users who have created workers with Client v4 but want to give Orkes Conductor a shot, they just need to add the orkes-conductor-client dependency to their project and instantiate the client with OrkesAuthentication as a Header Supplier. Switching back to OSS is as simple as removing that Header Supplier.\n\nFind out the 6 differences between Conductor OSS and Orkes Conductor.\n\n6. Improved examples and documentation\n\nWe’ve started consolidating examples into a dedicated module, with improvements that cover key areas like authorization, managing workflow and task definitions, scheduling workflows, and more. While this module is still a work in progress, we’ll continuously add and refine examples to provide better guidance and cover real-world use cases.\n\nOur goal is to enable developers to use our Client/SDK effectively and explore best practices as the module evolves.\n\nGetting started with Java Client v4\n\nHere’s how you can get started using Java Client v4:\n\nStep 1: Spin up Conductor\n\nUse Conductor OSS or Orkes Conductor:\n\nConductor OSS—Run it from source or use Docker.\n\nOrkes Conductor—Try out Orkes Developer Edition or sign up for a free trial.\n\nStep 2: Add conductor-client dependency to your project\n\nStep 3: Create a ConductorClient instance\n\nIf you are using Orkes Conductor, you will need to create an application and grab your credentials. With your key id and secret, create a ConductorClient instance:\n\nSee the complete code here.\n\nStep 4: Create a workflow\n\nYou can create a workflow in Conductor using this JSON:\n\nOr use our SDK module to create workflows as code. For that, you need to add the following dependency to your project:\n\nWith the dependency added, you can execute the following code to register the workflow:\n\nStep 5: Start a workflow\n\nNow that you have registered a workflow, you can start it with code:\n\nSee the complete code here.\n\nStep 6: Run a worker\n\nYou need a worker polling for “hello_workflow” tasks and executing them to complete the workflow you started in Step 5.\n\nFor that, you can run this example:\n\nThese complete examples can be found here.\n\nNote: If you want to run these code snippets in Orkes Conductor, remember to authenticate.\n\nWhat’s next?: Roadmap\n\nWe aim for full parity between OSS server models and SDKs, so stay tuned for more changes to Conductor’s Java SDK and improved documentation. To stay up-to-date with our progress, check out the Conductor OSS Project Board. To request features or report bugs, create a ticket in our GitHub repository or contact us on Slack.\n\nWe’ll also soon tackle other supported languages: JavaScript, C#, Go, and Clojure. In the meantime, happy coding! Don’t forget to follow the Conductor OSS project and support us by giving a ⭐.",

      "# [Orkes Case Study](https://www.orkes.io/case-study/spi-logistics)\nThe move from point-to-point, proprietary integrations\n\n\"We knew we needed to move away from these point-to-point integrations between our TMS and various third-party integrations whenever possible and move to integrations where we can control the relationships between the TMS and external systems,\" Peralta says. The various integrations and associated user interfaces were also hampering the efficiency. \"We started working to integrate everything into the TMS using our own APIs to control integration,\" Peralta adds.\n\n\"We knew we needed to move away from these point-to-point integrations between our TMS and various third-party integrations whenever possible and move to integrations where we can control the relationships between the TMS and external systems,\"\n\n– Ezequiel Peralta, VP of technology at SPI Logistics\n\nInitially, to achieve the integration autonomy Peralta and the team sought, SPI Logistics turned to an Apache Airflow managed service and Good Cloud Composer as its workflow orchestrator.\n\nThe team hoped this would enable an integration point for batch-loading data from their data warehouse and TMS, and run other data pipelines that supported their operations. \"We've started using Airflow as that integration point,\" Peralta explains.\n\nThe system worked well for certain types of data, such as pulling data from their TMS and pushing that data to their payments processor or pulling the data necessary to update their customers on the precise location of their freight. \"We started quickly designing everything so that our system was highly configurable and could scale,\" Peralta says.\n\nIt wasn't long before they encountered hurdles with the system. Peralta explains that as long as the team created generic and basic functions, everything worked. However, as the team added more functionality, they learned there were requirements they couldn't adequately meet with Apache Airflow — especially regarding transactional and event-based data. Further, the team believed they were becoming too dependent on vendor-specific features and too locked into a single vendor.\n\nThe team decided it would be better served by moving to an event-driven architecture. \"An event-driven architecture would be a better fit. It was then that we realized we'd need to find an alternative way to manage our workflows,\" he says.\n\nOrkes Conductor delivered by Orkes Cloud \"the best option\"\n\nThe team expected several critical factors in its new search for a workflow orchestrator. First, it had to be open source, developer-friendly, and ideally delivered as a managed service.\n\nIn addition to Orkes Conductor, the team considered Cadence and Camunda. After a careful evaluation, the team selected Orkes Conductor as its ideal workflow orchestration platform due to its effective management of workflows, orchestration of data pipelines, and support of event-driven architectures. As the team preferred to focus on building business workflows and maximizing SPI Logistics' operations instead of managing the supporting infrastructure, Peralta and the team selected Orkes Conductor as a fully managed service delivered via the Orkes Cloud.\n\n\"We are a small team. We didn't want to have to manage the day-to-day support and maintenance. That's one of the biggest reasons we selected Orkes Conductor delivered via Orkes Cloud,\" Peralta explains. Orkes Cloud is a fully managed platform that delivers Orkes Conductor and helps improve workflow management. And Orkes Cloud provides the workflow platform for optimizing complex, long-running tasks and comprehensive logs and metrics for troubleshooting and optimization.\n\n\"We are a small team. We didn't want to have to manage the day-to-day support and maintenance. That's one of the biggest reasons we selected Orkes Conductor delivered via Orkes Cloud,\"\n\nFurther, Peralta says they preferred a developer-focused tool rather than a business-user-focused tool. That's why they appreciated Orkes' software development kits (SDKs). The simple Python SDKs also helped place Orkes over the top. Finally, Conductor, created and used within Netflix, is a proven workflow orchestration platform that will scale.\n\nBefore selecting and getting a sense of how Orkes Conductor would work, the SPI Logistics Team deployed Orkes Conductor on their own AWS instance. \"We succeeded in getting a conductor instance in our own AWS infrastructure. We realized quickly that we didn't want to maintain it continuously,\" Peralta says. \"The support we had from Orkes in our implementation was phenomenal. Being a small team, we can't afford the learning curve required to configure such systems,\" he says.",
      "# [Emerging Tech Trends 2024: The Latest Developments in AI, API, and Automation](https://orkes.io/blog/tech-trends-2024-ai-api-automation/)\nTechnology has always been the lynchpin in driving progress — from the first ships built to the first industrial revolution to the computer age. The time between each successive technological wave has been shortening, and in the past few years, we have seen explosive growth in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its capabilities.\n\nWhile AI has been the epicenter of most tech buzz, it is just one tailwind in the wider trajectory toward greater automation in computer-based industries. In this article, we will explore the latest tech trends in AI, APIs, and automation that can impact your business. Find out how AI serves as the frontrunner and API as the technical bedrock that accelerates ongoing tech trends, with automation as the overarching motivation for the latest developments in the tech and business landscape.\n\nGenAI has unlocked new ways to work\n\nThe viral release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT3.5 in 2022 sparked a huge wave of excitement, as millions of people experimented with what it could do and what it meant for the future of work. Chatbots like ChatGPT are a form of intelligence known as Generative AI (GenAI), which is capable of producing naturalistic images, text, or even videos based on a given prompt.\n\nAt the core of GenAI are AI programs known as large language models (LLMs), which consume large amounts of training data in order to produce real-like data. Now, in 2024, ChatGPT is just one of the few thousand LLMs available for use. From enterprise offerings like Google Gemini, Amazon Bedrock, and Anthropic Claude to the 650K open-source models hosted on Hugging Face (as of May 2024), there is no shortage of choice when it comes to using GenAI as a copilot for work.\n\nAI-augmented code\n\nUnsurprisingly, the tech sector has been one of the first few to adopt GenAI in work. Many companies, big and small, have been using LLM chatbots like ChatGPT to produce, rewrite, and debug code, accelerating developer productivity. A survey by GitHub found that 92% of US-based developers are using AI coding tools for work, and 70% feel the benefits of using such tools.\n\nSome early entrants to code completion tools are Tabnine, and more recently, GitHub Copilot and Google’s CodeGemma.\n\nBut beyond using GenAI for writing code, there are many more possibilities for AI-powered software development. At the keynote for the 2024 Apidays Singapore conference, Manjunath Bhat (VP Analyst - Gartner) remarked that AI could also play a role in other high-impact avenues, like suggesting what should be built or explaining legacy or indecipherable code.\n\nThus far, there is a fast-expanding array of AI tools for automating software tests, generating documentation, and answering developer questions.\n\nSpecialized models, plug-ins, and more\n\nToday, the average person may ask ChatGPT to summarize an essay, provide travel itineraries, or solve logic puzzles. Such chatbots are based on general-purpose models that can handle a gamut of tasks across domains.\n\nWhile generic models have the advantage of being able to handle — with varying success — any task right away with no training required, they often fall short when the user requires a more accurate or complex response. Issues like hallucination, bias, or inaccuracies are some of the biggest challenges to implementing and scaling AI in a highly specialized business context.\n\nDomain-specific models\n\nA variety of domain-specific and multilingual models have entered the scene to address the limitations of generic models. These specialized models are trained with domain-specific datasets, allowing the model to learn and perform far better on specialized tasks.\n\nGoogle’s Med-PaLM 2 model was trained with curated medical databases, becoming the first LLM to perform at 85% accuracy on medical examinations. Such domain-specific LLMs are the first crest in the next wave of AI development, where LLMs can be safely deployed in real-world contexts like assisting with tuberculosis diagnoses or analyzing past legal cases.\n\nAlready, there are LLMs like BloombergGPT and FinGPT for finance, ChatLAW for law, and ClimateBERT for climate and environment.\n\nPlug-ins, API connectivity\n\nBesides specialized models, another way to power up general models is through plug-ins or connectivity with APIs.\n\nLLM plug-ins extend the model’s capabilities. Through API calls, these plugins can provide access to external databases or execute third-party tasks like making a hotel reservation. That’s how plug-ins enable LLMs to handle more complex requests like acting as a personal shopper or creating a financial report based on the latest data.\n\nWhile OpenAI has rolled back ChatGPT’s plug-ins after a year of service, the game is still on to get LLMs hooked up with APIs. Ongoing projects like Gorilla (UC Berkeley) and RestGPT (Peking University) are working to build LLM-powered systems that can carry out real-world actions based on a command, like “create a Spotify playlist” or “book a flight to Paris”.\n\nIn these frameworks, LLMs act as a switchboard operator who knows the right APIs to call when prompted, then formulates the API request and parses the response for the user. API connectivity promises a new breakthrough for LLMs: beyond just a conversational partner, LLMs can act and carry out tasks in the real world, bringing us one step closer to natural language interfaces.\n\nAPI as a Product, API as tech accelerant\n\nIf the 2010s were the decade for the rise of the software-as-a-service (SaaS) model, then the 2020s are all about API as a Product (AaaP). Under a SaaS model, businesses offer their unique services and strengths through web-based applications, like Gmail for mail services or Zoom for video conferencing.\n\nHowever, in recent years, applications are gradually becoming more modular and built using a microservice-based infrastructure. This means that application functionalities like payment, notifications, or even login credentials are added using APIs. Because APIs expose the capabilities of a service in a programmatic manner, it is much easier for developers to build products without having to code everything from scratch.\n\nThis change in software development heralds an API-based economy, where products and services are offered and accessed through APIs.\n\nAPI as a Product\n\nStripe, Sendgrid, and Twilio—these are companies that have grown tremendously by selling third-party API functionalities to other enterprises. More and more API offerings are expected to crop up in the coming decade, especially for industry-specific APIs like payroll, open banking, government, and so on.\n\nAs the API market grows, Kong's 2023 API Impact Report estimates that APIs will contribute $14.2 trillion to the global economy by 2027, up from $10.9 trillion in 2023.\n\nAlong with the economic boom, there has been an explosion of tooling, standards, and platforms to support the growth of API as a Product. With so many APIs entering the market, it has become more difficult to discover and integrate each and every API into a given application. Two key trends stand out:\n\nAPI portals and marketplaces—Provide a single point of collaboration where consumers can easily try, observe, use, and subscribe to API products.\n\nUnified APIs—Provide a single point of access to multiple APIs, so users only need to integrate one API to obtain the capabilities of multiple APIs.\n\nAPI as tech accelerant\n\nAn API-first economy espouses an interface-first approach, which means exposing capabilities and hiding complexities. This hallmark of APIs has made it the foundation for the rapid growth of many tech trends, the most prominent of which is AI.\n\nSince most LLMs have only been commercially available in recent years, many have been built with an API-first approach. Many LLMs can be programmatically accessed via APIs, making it super convenient for developers to integrate AI capabilities into their applications. In other words, API access has precipitated the rapid availability of AI-powered tools and features on the market within just the past two years.\n\nAPIs have also served as the backbone for the recent proliferation of no- and low-code application builders like Bubble and Xano. With APIs, users can create applications without having to know a programming language. These tools have also led to the rise of citizen developers, enabling businesses to quickly build applications and dashboards without a large developer team.\n\nAll these emerging trends in AI and API point to the same undercurrent of opportunity: lower barriers of entry to and automation of computer-based work.\n\nAutomation in computer-based industries\n\nMuch like how the steam engine had automated blue-collar work in energy, manufacturing, and logistics, we are now entering a whole new era of automation across sectors, especially in computer-based industries.\n\nNeedless to say, AI is one of the key factors towards greater automation. Research by Goldman Sachs suggests that 18% of global work could be automated by AI, with the biggest impact felt in white-collar jobs like administration and business operations.\n\nIt is important to note that AI is unlikely to make entire job functions redundant. Rather, repetitive or low-impact tasks can be delegated to AI automation, allowing more time for high-impact or more complex work. For example, in customer support, GenAI-enabled chatbots can interact autonomously with customers to provide basic support and handle common inquiries, while human agents can handle more demanding cases.\n\nAnother key catalyst is the growing availability of automation tools, such as RPA (robotic process automation) software and orchestration platforms.\n\nRPA (robotic process automation)—Automates high-volume, time-consuming, repetitive tasks using a bot. The bot replicates human actions on computer applications, like entering data from PDFs into a spreadsheet and emailing it, which eliminates such high-effort yet low-stakes tasks found in many business processes.\n\nOrchestration—Automates the coordination of multiple systems, applications, and services through a centralized coordinating service. Based on a predefined workflow, the orchestrator runs through a series of tasks in order to achieve a complex or long-running business process, such as managing shipment orders, upgrading cloud infrastructure, or even deploying LLM-powered applications.\n\nFrom AI to API to automation tools, we have yet again entered an age where computer-based technology will revolutionize how businesses are run. These trends promise greater productivity and connectivity across systems, allowing people to focus on high-impact work. In 2024, it is more important than ever for businesses to leverage new technology to drive value.\n\nScale with Conductor\n\nConductor is an open-source orchestration platform that automates complex or long-running processes, such as AI integration flows, microservice application flows, DevOps processes, transactional flows, and more.

      "# [Maestro: Netflix's Workflow Orchestrator](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41037745)\nThe issue is that \"workflow orchestration\" is a broad problem space. Companies need to address a lot of disparate issues and so any solution ends up being a giant product w/ a lot of associated functionality and heavily opinionated as it grows into a big monolith. This is why almost universally folks are never happy.\n\nIn reality there are five main concerns: 1. Resource scheduling-- \"I have a job or collection of jobs to run... allocate them to the machines I have\" 2. Dependency solving-- If my jobs have dependencies on each other, perform the topological sort so I can dispatch things to my resource scheduler 3. API/DSL for creating jobs and workflows. I want to define a DAG... sometimes static, sometimes on the fly. 4. Cron-like functionality. I want to be able to run things on a schedule or ad-hoc. 5. Domain awareness-- If doing ETL I want my DAGs to be data aware... if doing ML/AI workflows then I want to be able to surface info about what I'm actually doing with them\n\nNo one solution does all these things cleanly. So companies end up building or hacking around off the shelf stuff to deal with the downsides of existing solutions. Hence it's a perpetual cycle of everyone being unhappy.\n\nI don't think that you can just spin up a startup to deliver this as a \"solution\". This needs to be solved with an open source ecosystem of good pluggable modular components.\n\nThe issue indeed is that \"workflow orchestration\" is a broad problem space. I would argue that the solution is not this:\n\n> I don't think that you can just spin up a startup to deliver this as a \"solution\". This needs to be solved with an open source ecosystem of good pluggable modular components.\n\nBut rather more specialized tools that solve specific issues.\n\nWhat you describe just sounds like a better implemented version of Airflow or the over 100 other systems that are actively trying to be this today (Flyte, Dagster, Prefect, Argo Workflows, Kubeflow, Nifi, Oozie, Conductor, Cadence, Temporal, Step Functions, Logic Apps, your CI system of choice has their own, need I continue, that is not even scratching the surface). Most of those have some sort of \"plugin\" ecosystem for custom code, in varying degrees of robustness.\n\nFor what it is worth, everyone and their mom thinks they can make and wants to be this orchestrator. It's a problem that is just so generic and such a wide net that you end up with annoying-to-use building blocks because everyone wants to architecture astronaut themselves into being the generic workflow orchestration engine. The ultimate system design trap: Something so fundamentally easy to grok and conceptualize that you can PoC one in hours or days, but near infinite possibilities of what you can do with it, resulting in near infinite edge cases.\n\nInstead, I'd rather companies just focus on the problem space that it lends itself to. Instead of Dagster saying \"Automate any workflow\" and try to capture that space, just make building blocks for data engineering workflows and get really good at that. Instead of Github Actions being a generic \"workflow engine\" just have it really good at making CI workflow building blocks.\n\nBut we can't have it that way. Because then some architecture astronaut will come around and design a generic workflow engine for orchestrating your domain specific workflow engines and say that you no longer need those.\n\nActually I think I just convinced myself that what you are suggesting actually IS the right way. If companies just said \"we will provide an Airflow plugin\" instead of building their own damn Airflow this would be easy. But we won't ever have that either. What we really need is some standards around that. Like if CNCF got together and got tired of this and said \"This is THE canonical and supported engine for Kube workflows, bring your plugins here if you want us to pump you up\". That might work. They've usually had better luck with putting people in lockstep in the Kube ecosystem at least than Apache has historically for more general FOSS stuff. Probably because the problem space there is more limited.\n\nFounder of https://windmill.dev here which share many similarities with Maestro.\n\n> Maestro is a general-purpose, horizontally scalable workflow orchestrator designed to manage large-scale workflows such as data pipelines and machine learning model training pipelines. It oversees the entire lifecycle of a workflow, from start to finish, including retries, queuing, task distribution to compute engines, etc.. Users can package their business logic in various formats such as Docker images, notebooks, bash script, SQL, Python, and more. Unlike traditional workflow orchestrators that only support Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), Maestro supports both acyclic and cyclic workflows and also includes multiple reusable patterns, including foreach loops, subworkflow, and conditional branch, etc.\n\nYou could replace Maestro with Windmill here and it would be precisely correct. Their rollup is what we call the openflow state.\n\nMain differences I see:\n\n- Windmill is written in Rust instead of Java.\n\n- Maestro relies on CockroachDB for state and us Postgresql for everything (state but also queue). I can see why they would use CockroachDB, we had to rollout our own sharding algorithms to make Windmill horizontally scale on our very large scale customer instances\n\n- Maestro is Apache 2.0 vs Windmill AGPL which is less friendly\n\n- It's backed by Netflix so infinite money but although we are profitable, we are a much smaller company\n\n- Maestro doesn't have extensive docs about self-hosting on k8s or docker-compose and either there is no UI to build stuff, or the UI is not yet well surfaced in their documentation\n\nBut overall, pretty cool stuff to open-source, will keep an eye on it and benchmark it asap\n\nI haven't touched Conductor for a few years now, but back in 2020 I did some work trying to implement it, even submitted a few PRs – https://github.com/Netflix/conductor/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%...\n\nMy impression of the code base, is I felt like it needed a lot of work to run in a non-Netflix environment. Which is part of why the project I was working on ended up abandoning Conductor – we were going to embed Conductor in our product as a workflow engine, we ended up building our own workflow engine from scratch instead. Another team did end up using it for some internal use cases, but scalability/reliability/etc are less of a concern for internal use cases as opposed to customer-facing ones.\n\nAnd then Netflix abandons it – and then they open source something else which depends on an old version of it – well, I'm happy they open source anything, but it fits with my earlier impression – throwing stuff over the fence which can be a struggle to adopt in an outside environment. Still, throwing it over the fence is better than not releasing it at all.",

      "# [Florence Healthcare](https://www.orkes.io/case-study/florence-healthcare)\nAbout Florence Healthcare\n\nFlorence Healthcare is a healthcare software company that specializes in streamlining clinical trial operations through advanced technology solutions. They provide software that automates and simplifies the management of clinical trial documents, workflows, and remote monitoring, enabling faster and more efficient research processes. Florence's platform is designed to enhance collaboration between research sites, sponsors, and contract research organizations (CROs), ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements while reducing administrative burdens. Their solutions are widely used in the life sciences industry to accelerate drug development and improve patient outcomes by making clinical trials more accessible and efficient.\n\nThe Challenge\n\nFlorence Healthcare’s business model revolves around the ability to accelerate the rate at which patients can apply and get accepted for clinical trials - they need to ensure their workflows are not only durable, but precise and fast. Prior to working with Orkes and Conductor, the team at Florence Healthcare was spending too much time building and managing infrastructure, rather than building mission critical applications and workflows to improve the goals and outcomes of their business.\n\nA lagging industry\n\nWithin the healthcare industry, specifically around clinical trials, there are currently no laws that require patient records, and other important documents, to be digitized unlike the financial services industry for example. Because of this, oftentimes nurses have to track down doctors to get signature approval, taking valuable time away from their job. While attempting to remedy these industry specific inefficiencies, Florence Healthcare has to ensure they are able to quickly build the right applications and workflows, and in doing so they need the right technology and partners.\n\nThe cost of building and maintaining infrastructure\n\nFlorence Healthcare faced significant hurdles in scaling its operations due to the time and resources required to build and maintain infrastructure. As the company grew, so did the complexity of managing the underlying systems that supported its workflows. Engineers were spending an increasing amount of time on tasks related to infrastructure, such as configuring servers, managing databases, and ensuring system reliability. This diverted attention away from their core responsibilities—developing innovative solutions to streamline clinical trials.\n\nThe burden of infrastructure management not only slowed down product development but also introduced operational inefficiencies. Moreover, the constant maintenance required to keep systems running smoothly increased the risk of errors and downtime, which could disrupt critical clinical trial operations. Florence Healthcare’s Chief Technology Officer, Andres Garcia, says “To me, as a CTO, spending time building infrastructure is a waste of time.”\n\nRegulatory and compliance requirements\n\nFlorence Healthcare has to ensure that every document containing a signature has a detailed record, for example if the signature was given as an acknowledgement or a sign off/approval. While this seems like a relatively simple task to accomplish, the team at Florence were in the process of creating more and more applications that each required an audit trail, which proved to be a difficult task as they scaled operations.\n\nWhy Orkes?\n\nThe company turned to Orkes for workflow orchestration, seeking to automate and streamline their processes, reduce the operational burden, and ultimately accelerate the pace of innovation in clinical trials. Florence Healthcare’s main goal was to find a way to abstract out all of the labor intensive processes around building and maintaining infrastructure, along with features and functionalities that were necessary in their industry, but didn’t have time to build out themselves.\n\nWith Orkes, Florence Healthcare was able to have their cloud on AWS, hosted by Orkes allowing their engineering team to focus on building new applications and automate many of their business processes. This led to the streamlined development of many microservices and applications that have ensured patients get swift access to clinical trials they desperately need.\n\n\"Infrastructure is not a value add from the perspective of my team building it. I want to use it like I use water or electricity.\"\n\n– Andres Garcia, Chief Technology Officer\n\nResults and Achievements\n\nEnhanced efficiency of engineering teams\n\nFlorence Healthcare has two small engineering teams that are utilizing Orkes daily. One team that is responsible for integrations that manages all of the data coming in and out of their system and another team responsible for automating small processes in the backend that don’t necessarily belong in the application itself but provide value via data transformation.\n\nAbstracted DevOps\n\nWith Orkes handling the heavy lifting of infrastructure and DevOps in general, the team at Florence Healthcare has been able to develop and launch mission critical applications that are vital in helping the company succeed in its goal to accelerate clinical research by streamlining the management of clinical trial documents and workflows and bring new therapies to market faster by reducing the administrative burden and simplifying compliance in the clinical trial process.\n\nCompliance out of the box\n\nOrkes comes with Audit Logs out of the box that enable Florence Healthcare to automatically audit any changes made to metadata within their workflows. As they continued to grow and expand their applications across their business, this feature made it extremely easy for the team to remain compliant within the standards of the healthcare industry without having to spend the engineering resources to build it out.\n\nImplementing Gen AI for document management\n\nFlorence Healthcare has been experimenting with utilizing GenAI to build workflows to implement a semantic search across documents and utilize Orkes’ prompt engineering to summarize document’s contents. Orkes makes accessing and operationalizing LLMs like AWS Bedrock simple and seamless.\n\nConclusion\n\nFlorence Healthcare's partnership with Orkes has been instrumental in their mission to revolutionize clinical trials by streamlining document management workflows and accelerating the research process. By leveraging Orkes' workflow orchestration capabilities, Florence Healthcare has successfully overcome the challenges of infrastructure management, enabling their engineering teams to focus on innovation rather than maintenance. This collaboration has not only improved operational efficiency but has also ensured compliance with industry regulations, thereby enhancing the speed and quality of clinical trials. Through Orkes, Florence Healthcare is well-positioned to continue advancing their goal of bringing new therapies to market faster, ultimately improving patient outcomes and making clinical trials more accessible.",

      "# [Transforming Software Architecture: Why Intelligent Orchestration Drives Future by Andy Williams](https://www.gbiimpact.com/news/transforming-software-architecture)\nThe early days: monolithic architectures\n\nIn the early days of software development, applications were built as monolithic systems—a single, self-contained unit where all components lived together. From the user interface to thebusiness logic and data access layer, everything was part of one large codebase. This approach was straightforward, easy to deploy, and well-suited for smaller applications. However, as applications grew more complex, the limitations of monoliths emerged. Updating one part of the system could affect the entire application, prolonging development and deployment cycles. Scaling a monolith was another challenge, as it typically required scaling the entire application, even if only one component needed additional resources. The tight coupling of components also meant that any failure could bring down the entire system.\n\nThe shift to service-oriented architecture (SOA)\n\nTo address the rigidity of monolithic systems, the concept of service-oriented architecture\n\n(SOA) emerged. SOA advocated for breaking down the monolith into loosely coupled services\n\nthat communicated with each other over a network. Each service was responsible for a specific\n\nbusiness function and could be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, but shared the\n\nsame data storage layer. An abstraction layer like enterprise service buses (ESBs) was used to\n\nto enable communication between multiple services at once.\n\nThe advent of cloud-nativity\n\nAs virtualization, containerization, and cloud computing gained traction, cloud-native software architecture also grew in popularity. These applications could rely on the elasticity, scalability, and resilience of cloud platforms and deliver services in a highly scalable and efficient manner without worrying about infrastructural or hardware issues. Cloud-nativity accelerated that earlier shift towards modularity and the philosophy of building applications as collections of loosely-coupled, independently-scalable services. Now that it was possible for business to focus entirely on building software using optimized cloud infrastructure, why not move towards greater agility and deploy new features faster and more reliably?\n\nThe Rise of Microservices\n\nWith cloud computing, microservices architecture became the next inevitable step in software architecture. Similar to SOA, microservices are smaller, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled individually. Each microservice focuses on a single business capability, each with its own separate database storage, and communicates with other services through lightweight protocols such as REST or gRPC. However, microservices introduce their own challenges. An application flow entails multiple calls to different microservices, and the challenge of coordinating these calls becomes increasingly complex as the number of microservices grows. Monitoring, debugging, and ensuring consistent data across distributed services require robust tooling and practices. While microservices offer speed and flexibility, they also demand greater operational overhead. A solution to this microservice complexity was sorely needed.\n\nUntangling complexity with orchestration\n\nAs software architecture continues to evolve, orchestration has emerged as a key approach to managing the complexity of distributed systems. Orchestration automates the coordination, configuration, and management of various services required for a system. In other words, microservices, databases, cloud resources, and external APIs get orchestrated into a seamless flow that can handle the dynamic demands of modern applications. Orchestration platforms, like Orkes Conductor or AWS Step Functions, enable businesses to define workflows and processes that ensure services work together in a coordinated manner. Such platforms not only simplifythe development work for distributed systems but also improve their reliability by handling retries, timeouts, and failure recovery automatically. By abstracting the complexity of service dependencies, orchestration enables developers to focus on building business logic rather than worrying about plumbing code. With orchestration, it's easier to build resilient distributed system, manage long-running processes, and ensure state consistency across the system.\n\nWhy orchestration is the way forward",

After a first investigation, our contacts discovered an obfuscated JavaScript code sending reconnaissance data to a PHP script hosted on the nuceciwan129[.]xyz server.\n\nFollowing this initial discovery, we began a dedicated investigation to understand the attack chain and identify any other websites compromised by the same script or its variants. During this investigation, we discovered 25 compromised websites linked to the Kurdish community with four different variants of the framework found on nuceciwan129[.]xyz. These ranged from the simplest, which merely stole the user’s location, to more complex ones that recorded images from the selfie camera and led selected users to install a malicious APK, i.e an application used on Android.\n\nEven though no sophisticated code was used in this attack, such as using zero-day exploits to compromise the target’s devices, it is worth mentioning the size and duration of this campaign which makes it unique. The first observations of compromised websites date back to the end of 2022. Therefore, some websites have been stealing users’ locations for over a year before being noticed.\n\nCyber attacks against the Kurdish minority aiming to collect intelligence are common, often attributed to the StrongPity intrusion set in open sources. However, after days of investigation, we found no links to previous StrongPity campaigns, and the TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in these watering holes and the discovered APK do not match any known intrusion set active in the Middle East. Therefore, we believe that a previously unknown activity cluster has been discovered.\n\nIf you are not interested by the technical analysis, you can directly jump to the victimology analysis by clicking here.\n\nWatering holes analysis\n\nAcross the 25 compromised kurdish websites, we identified four distinct variants of a same script designed to gather intelligence from online visitors. These scripts ranged from simple ones that exfiltrated the visitors’ locations to more complex frameworks that accessed the selfie camera to take pictures of the user and redirected a selection of them to a malicious APK installation web page.\n\nIt is worth noting that these variants share multiple modules, and different versions may have been deployed on the same website over time. For instance, the website rojnews[.]news has encountered three variants of these scripts since its initial compromise in December 2022, from the first variant to the fourth variant in November 2023 till today.\n\nVariant 1 – Getting the user location\n\nWe found this first variant on seventeen websites. The code is quite minimalistic: when the webpage is loaded, its body invokes the gL() (getLocation) method to execute the malicious JavaScript embedded in it. If the User-Agent is an Android or an iPhone, the current location of the user is retrieved – which requires the user’s validation – and the location is sent to a PHP script hosted on the compromised website, often located under /wp-includes/ms-menu.php.\n\nVariant 2 – Adding user tracking via a cookie\n\nThe second variant, found on ronahi[.]net, enhances users tracking capabilities by including the screen configuration option and a cookie named sessionIdVal in addition to the user’s location. The value of this cookie is generated through a compromised third-party, Kurd-linked website, ronahi[.]video.\n\nWhen ronahi[.]video/wo_cookie.php is requested by the malicious JavaScript code, the PHP script checks whether the cookie sessionIdVal is present in the client’s HTTP request for domain ronahi[.]video. If not, a random string is generated and stored in a cookie for a duration of one hour; otherwise, it returns the random string present in the cookie. This random string is then received and stored in a cookie associated with the compromised domain for 400 days. Also named sessionIdVal, its value is sent as a token in the HTTP request each time the user transmits their location data to the malicious PHP script hosted on the server, as shown below.\n\nFrom an operator’s point of view, it allows to get all the public IP addresses used by a specific user (possibly retrieved via the PHP script receiving the data) and track their location for 400 days, which can be a valuable intelligence source.\n\nHowever, we can note two possible mistakes from the operators. First, the PHP script wo_cookie.php doesn’t exist on the ronahi[.]video domain. It is likely that the attackers made a typo, in fact the malicious script is wo_cookies.php. Moreover, the duration of one hour of the cookie present to the ronahi[.]video prevents the attackers from tracking the user for a long period across multiple compromised websites, which, we think, was the ultimate goal of resorting to a third-party domain.\n\nVariant 3 – Browser configuration, user location, selfie\n\nThe third variant is a more complex reconnaissance script that not only retrieves the user’s location, tracking token and public IP address but also gathers various other pieces of information from the current browsing session. Different variants of this script exist; some are directly embedded in the webpage, as it was the case with lekolin[.]org and ciwanensoresger[.]com, while others are contained in a single JavaScript file and obfuscated with Obfuscator.io, as seen with nuceciwan129[.]xyz.\n\nSimilar to the first variant, this script is launched using the gL() method, but it now checks for a broader range of devices, including iPhones, iPads, iPods, and Android devices. If the User Agent matches one of these devices, the script first retrieves the local IP address using WebRTC and the current battery status using navigator.getBattery(). It then checks whether the browser is in private mode using the Incognito library. If the browser is not in private mode and if it passes a useless check derived from the current datetime, the script checks for the presence of a cookie named CSESSID.\n\nIf the CSESSID cookie is not set, a method named init() is called. This method attempts to retrieve images from the selfie camera using navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia and places them in a hidden HTML canvas on the webpage. The CSESSID cookie, with a duration of ten days, is then set. The image present in the canvas is converted to Base64 and sent to a PHP script along with various other information, such as:\n\nThe current URL;\n\nThe screen resolution;\n\nAn MD5 hash of the WebGL configuration;\n\nThe list of the local IP addresses retrieved from WebRTC;\n\nThe battery status via navigator.getBattery;\n\nThe current network related information via navigator.connection (if supported);\n\nThe current Wifi information via navigator.connection (if supported);\n\nOther data from the navigator such as the number of CPUs, TouchPoints, language;\n\nThe remote IP which is retrieved from ronahi[.]video/wo_cookies.php;\n\nThe tracking token of the sessionIdVal cookie;\n\nThen, the script gets the GPS location via navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition and sends this location along with the same parameters as the request for the image taken from the selfie camera.\n\nVariant 4 – Browser configuration, user location, user picture, APK installation\n\nThe latest variant, referred to as Variant 4, has only been encountered the news websites rojnews[.]news, hawarnews[.]com and targetplatform[.]net. This variant represents an evolution from the previous codes into a framework where each main functionality is handled by separate modules. It is not launched via a call to the gL() method (which no longer exists) but instead is activated when the JavaScript file is loaded.\n\nWhen loaded, the main() method is called. Similar to Variant 2, it checks if the user agent matches an iPad, iPod, iPhone, or Android device and if the browsing session is not in private mode.\n\nOnce this check is successful, the script looks for the sessionIdVal cookie. If it is not set, the script creates it with a random string and a duration of 190 days, without requesting ronahi[.]video to create it. Then, several pieces of data are retrieved, such as the local IP address via WebRTC and the battery status. A list of modules to be executed is then established. By default, this list is set to 1110, where each position corresponds to a specific module: 1 indicates that the module should be executed, and 0 indicates that it should not.\n\nHere are the modules that can be executed:\n\nImage module: Retrieves an image from the selfie camera;\n\nLocation module: Retrieves the current location of the user;\n\nWebRTC module: Retrieves the local IP addressing by using WebRTC;\n\nAPK module: Redirects the user to a fake APK installation webpage and sends telemetry about it;\n\nSince the last character (0) in the default module list 1110 corresponds to the module that redirects the user to a fake APK installation page, this page can only be accessed by previously selected users.\n\nIt is worth noting that the list of modules to be executed can originate from different sources. It can be set via a cookie named modSession or through a URL parameter named uid. Operators aiming to push users to install a malicious APK likely send malicious URLs containing this parameter via internet messaging to their targets or set the modSession cookie through their PHP script.\n\nWe were only able to retrieve the fake APK installation page hosted on Rojnews, accessible at hxxps://rojnews[.]news/ku/wp-content/mobile.html. Both hawarnews[.]com and targetplatform[.]net redirect users to hxxps://targetplatform[.]net/mobile.html, which returned a 404 error during the investigation. The Rojnews APK installation page is straightforward, displaying a screenshot of the Android application. The APK is downloaded when the user clicks on the screenshot or the Google Play icon.\n\nRojNews malicious APK analysis\n\nRojNews is a very simple application that only embeds the RojNews website using the Android Webview class. Android Webview is a system component that provides web browser viewing functions within an app. It allows any application to display a web page without having to switch to the device’s Internet browser. As you can see below, when opening the application, only the website appears, allowing the user to browse it.\n\nHowever, the code of RojNews, which is obfuscated by using the ProGuard Java packer contains a malicious class named LocationHelper which is launched as a service and aimed to beacon the current user location to the RojNews webserver and receive commands to execute. By installing it, the user can directly notice with the requested permissions that something is going wrong with the installed app as it requires the access to the contacts, the current location and an access to the storage. Here are the commands supported:\n\n100 – This command is aimed at retrieving system-related information, from the device’s properties to the installed applications and current network information (active network interface, WiFi BSSID & SSID, IP addressing, etc.).\n\n101 – This command is aimed at retrieving a list of contacts from the infected device, including associated properties for each contact.\n\n102 – This command retrieves the current location (latitude, longitude, altitude, accuracy) of the device. It is worth mentioning that by default, the device sends the result of this command as a beacon, and it is not implemented as a command to execute.\n\n103 – This command sends back a list containing the files and directories present on the local and external storage.\n\n104 – This command (not tested successfully in live environment) allows the operators to retrieve a file from the local and external storage. The file is sent back to the operators encoded in Base64.\n\nIt is worth noting that this malicious code doesn’t have any persistence mechanism but is only executed when the user opens the RojNews application. Once the user opens the application, and after 10 seconds, the LocationHelper service starts beaconning the background to the URL rojnews[.]news/wp-includes/sitemaps/ via HTTP POST requests, sharing the current location of the user and waiting for commands to execute.\n\nHunting for additional infrastructure\n\nThe watering holes and the malicious Android application communicate through PHP scripts hosted on compromised web servers. This is a clever tactic by the attacker, as it prevents network-based detection and reduces the likelihood of attribution based on its infrastructure. Therefore, the infrastructure analysis is pretty weak.\n\nThanks to our contacts, we got one of the PHP scripts acting as a gateway to the attacker infrastructure. This PHP script, which contains dead code, transfers the received data and additional HTTP headers to an upstream server by using stream_context_create. The data are sent to webmail.onlinearuba[.]net/7b2[redacted]600a/logs.php, a server rented by the attacker hosted under the AS 36352 (AS-COLOCROSSING) with the IP address 23.95.14[.]63. This server has a directory named “update” with an HTML file including a script hosted at the URL hxxp://170.75.161[.]102/asd.js. Even though the file just presents a JavaScript alert, it gives us a new server associated with this intrusion set.\n\nBy looking at servers sharing similarities with 170.75.161[.]102, we found 24.246.223[.]228 that shares the same Apache version with limited headers – which are shared by four servers on the internet – and the same directory structure as the files /javascript/script/jquery.js and /javascript/script/jquery.min.js which are present on both servers. Even if this link is quite discriminant, we consider it as weak.\n\nVictimology analysis\n\nOver the investigation, we quickly noticed that all the compromised websites we identified were directly linked to the Kurdish community, especially to the Kurdish-led de facto Rojava authority in North-East Syria, but also in Iraq and in Turkey. To better understand motivations for potential intelligence gathering through cyber espionage, it is useful to assess the political context of the Kurdish situation in Syria and the region.\n\nPolitical context of the Kurdish situation in Syria and Middle-East\n\nKurdish people are an ethnic group in the Middle East spread over a territory of more than 500,000 km2 spanning four countries: Turkey (about 18 million Kurdish inhabitants), Iran (8 million), Iraq (7 million), and Syria (2 million). They have a significant diaspora, primarily in Europe, with over 650,000 Kurds in Germany.\n\nIn Syria, in the context of the Syrian Civil War, the Kurdish party PYD, among other forces, established an Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria, also known as Rojava administration. The territorial control of Rojava was established by the YPG – the armed force affiliated with the PYD – which actively contributed to the defeat of the Islamic State organisation in Syria with the US-led international coalition. The relationship between the Syrian state and the Kurdish authority in Rojava is complex, characterised by successive periods of cooperation and conflict, as both sides deal with issues of autonomy, territorial control, and fight against common enemies and adversaries.\n\nTurkey sees the Rojava administration as an extension of the PKK (Kurdistan Workers’ Party), a Kurdish militant and political group engaged in an armed struggle with Turkey for Kurdish autonomy and rights since 1984. Thus, Ankara considers both the PYD and YPG forces as terrorist organizations and as a threat to national security due to the shared border between Turkey and Rojava, resulting in military interventions and ongoing tensions. Turkey’s operations in Northern Syria, including Euphrates Shield (2016), Olive Branch (2018), and Peace Spring (2019), aimed to eliminate Kurdish forces and create a buffer zone.\n\nIn North-Eastern Iraq, the Kurdish region is ruled by a semi-autonomous Kurdish government within the Iraqi state (Kurdistan Regional Government, KRG). The main political force inside the KRG is opposed to the PKK/Rojava and is often reported as collaborating with Turkey over security affairs.\n\nMap published in the the French-speaking article “Le Rojava, une oasis au sein du chaos”\n\nby Pr. Tigrane Yegavian, Sciences Humaines\n\nWaterholed websites categorisation\n\nAmong the 21 kurdish websites compromised by waterholes, we can categorise them into different types.\n\nThe first group is related to Kurdish press and media mainly based in North East Syria. This territory is ruled de facto by the Rojava administration. Compromised websites include local radio stations based in cities along the Syrian-Turkish border such as Orkes FM, Dirbesiye FM or Star FM, as well as official websites from the Union of Free Media – Rojava’s de facto Ministry of Information – and one relative to SDF Press. Among those compromised websites, one is not based in Syria but in Iraq (Erbil), the RojNews agency (see analysis below).\n\nThe second group is websites related to the Rojava administration and its armed forces (YPG). Among them YPG Rojava, Sehiden Rojava (martyrs of Rojava, fallen YPG fighters), or the Initiative for Afrin (founded in Germany in August 2021, aiming to expose and address violations committed by Turkey and its affiliated armed groups in Afrin region of Syria since 2018). In addition, we could add to this group all compromised websites related to political parties or organisations supporting or linked to Rojava, such as Peoples’ United Revolutionary Movement (HBDH), Star Union of Women (Kongra Star) or the Movement for a Democratic Society (TED-DEM), ypj-off.\n\nThe last group is related to revolutionary far-left political parties and organisations in Turkey and Kurdish regions, including those linked to the PKK. We were able to identify waterholed website from the Party of Free Women in Kurdistan (PAJK, linked to PKK), the People’s Liberation Party-Front of Turkey (DHKP-C, classed as terrorist by Turkey, the US and the EU) and the Halkın Devrimci Güçleri (a group linked to DHKP-C).\n\nAttribution hypothesis of the cyber espionage campaign targeting the Kurdish websites\n\nTurkey\n\nThe first attribution hypothesis we considered is a cyber espionage campaign conducted by Turkish intelligence services. For Ankara, there is no difference between the compromised websites (North-East Syria Kurdish medias, Rojava administration / YPG and far-left revolutionary parties PJAK or DHKP-C) : all are considered as entities linked to PKK and its armed secession fight against Turkey, thus viewed as national security threats.\n\nAs already mentioned, Ankara has already conducted 3 military operations in Syria targeting Kurdish forces from Rojava. Thus, this waterhole campaign would likely be conducted to gather actionable information (GPS coordinates location, and sometimes “selfie” picture and extended information) on individuals considered as involved in terrorist activities according to Turkish intelligence.\n\nHowever, we did not find any technical elements or TTPs allowing us to link this operation to any open-source documented Turkey-nexus intrusion set such as StrongPity or Sea Turtle.\n\nSyria\n\nA second, yet less likely, attribution hypothesis would be the Syrian intelligence services. Now stabilised after years of uncertainty during the Syrian Civil War, the Syrian government is trying to regain territorial control of its full territory, including North-East Syria de facto ruled by the Rojava Kurdish administration. Although not in open confrontation with Rojava, the Syrian services might be interested in gathering intelligence on the activities of the armed forces of Rojava.\n\nBut that hypothesis would not explain the compromise of some websites, such as those related to DHKP-C, a left-wing revolutionary organisation active only in Turkey.\n\nKurdistan Regional Government (Iraq)\n\nThis attribution hypothesis, we assess a realistic possibility, is based on the opposition between Kurdish KRG (especially from KDP party) and Kurdish Rojava / PYD. According to many sources, the Kurdistan Regional Government of Iraq collaborates with Turkish intelligence to collect and exchange information about PKK or Rojava forces. Moreover, the arrest of a journalist from RojNews, one of the compromised websites, by KDP forces raises questions about a possible link to the compromised website (over the same period), especially on the malicious RojNews app able to exfiltrate GPS coordinates from the victim.\n\nAlthough no known intrusion set is linked to the Kurdistan Regional Government, it is not impossible that the operation could be conducted by the KRG, given the relatively moderate sophistication. Off note, the RojNews journalist arrest may also be part of intelligence exchange between Turkey and GRK.\n\nOther less likely hypotheses\n\nIran’s relationship with its Kurdish minority is characterised by significant government surveillance and repression to quell separatist movements and maintain control. Thus Iranian intelligence service, known to conduct cyber offensive and espionage operations, may have interests into gathering information on RojNews agency which publishes articles including on Iranian Kurdistan. Moreover, Iran is a strong supporter of the Syrian regime, which aims to regain control over Rojava territories. We found no technical link to the Iran-nexus intrusion sets we follow.\n\nRussia is also a strong supporter of the Syrian regime and may have interests in collecting intelligence on Kurdish forces allied – or partner – to Western forces (US-led coalition against ISIS). We found no technical link to the Russia-nexus intrusion sets we follow.\n\nConclusion\n\nEven though this watering hole campaign is of low sophistication, it is notable for the number of kurdish websites affected and its duration. It went unnoticed for over a year and a half despite multiple notifications to visitors of the infected sites, urging them to share their location or access their front-facing camera.\n\nAlthough Middle-East intelligence services are often suspected of cyber attacks against the Kurdish community, we have not discovered any connections between this campaign and any known intrusion sets. The campaign’s low level of sophistication suggests it might be the work of an uncovered threat actor with limited capabilities and relatively new to the field.\n\nThank you for reading this blog post.
