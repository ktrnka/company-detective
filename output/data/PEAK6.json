I was hooked instantly, and it was a lot easier than I expected. Quite similar to sailing, which I have some years of experience with. Therefore, I have decided I want to buy my own kit. Since we are talking about some serious pocket change here, I am looking for gear advice so I only buy once.\n\nKite: \n\nDuring lessons + a few days after, I rented a Flysurfer Peak 5 8m, and it was sufficient to propel me at upwards of 40-45 km/h on a frozen lake with quite deep powder. It felt perfect, with a good balance between power and manouverability! Wind was gusty, with 5 (8) m/s of wind, and quite typical conditions for what I will mainly be kiting in (say 3-4 to 12-15 m/s tops).\n\nI have decided on the Peak 5, but I am unsure if I should go one size up (11m) or stick with the 8m I have already tried and loved. Plan is to move on from the frozen lake to using it as a ski lift eventually. I am quite heavy, at 110 kg without gear.\n\nShould a heavy weight and safety conscious rider go 8m or 11m Peak? \n\nShould I wait for a potential Peak 6 next season or buy now (I got a fairly good price from a local dealer)? \n\nHarness: \n\nI have narrowed the decision down to two alternatives: 1) The Ozone Connect Backcountry V4 and 2) Ozone Connect Snow V4. I am leaning towards the first one, as I primarily will be touring with this kit (not much jumping or gliding). Only difference seems to be the spreader bar on the latter, which I guess will mostly add bulk for said use case? Are they equally safe when it comes to releasing?\n\nI plan to do use both skis and snowboard eventually, and I have a lot of experience on both.\n\nThank you for reading!\n\n## Comment ID kxiifl8 with +3 score by [(bearlybearbear, Reddit, 2024-04-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kiteboarding/comments/1bsjchv/gear_advice_peak_5_and_harness/kxiifl8/) (in reply to ID 1bsjchv):\nHey man, glad you loved it, I love the Peak great for learning/foiling/land touring however be aware this kite cannot support your weight and does not jump whatsoever!\n\nThis is why it is so simple to learn with it, you cannot be overpowered by it and it stays in the air regardless of gusts and down to almost 0 wind, unlike normal kites.\n\nThe Peak is famous for \"creating\" it's own wind (90kg, used to foil with a 5m in 10 knots) the bigger sizes get slower to manoeuvre and the low end gains aren't exponential.\n\nI would buy the 8 for snow and foiling in summer if you want to progress to that later. But then I would buy an ozone hyperlink (or other accessible, full depower cell kite) in 12 or 15 that will allow you to jump and also get that lower end higher.\n\nWorth looking at forums about snow kiting. The connect harness is also like a climbing harness and can get uncomfortable after a while, can pair it to padded cycling pants?\n\n### Comment ID kxik07r with +1 score by [(fotoprivat, Reddit, 2024-04-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kiteboarding/comments/1bsjchv/gear_advice_peak_5_and_harness/kxik07r/) (in reply to ID kxiifl8):\nThanks!

Probably not unless you buy Peak5 and next week Peak6 launches just 40€ more expensive.\n\nThere will be click in QR that should have been there long time ago.

It sucks to swap bars   during session in windy enviroment.\n\nTake harness that fits you. Safety mechanisms are in control bar & safety leash so that's not a concern in harness.\n\n### Comment ID kxg3rdd with +2 score by [(riktigtmaxat, Reddit, 2024-03-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kiteboarding/comments/1bsjchv/gear_advice_peak_5_and_harness/kxg3rdd/) (in reply to ID kxg2l4n):\nI would definitely say two kite quiver as well.

Good side is that they can fit in small place and dont weight much.\nLike Rik said, they lack some performance and upwind abilities etc but for touring they are great tools to have.\n\nPeople often start with just 1 kite and they soon regret it and end up buying more gear when they miss free weekends 😁 we are talking about weeks.\n\nAlso if you are going to ride in summer eventually, you need to upgrade your kitegear since Peaks just suck with twintip and they dont have ability to relaunch from water so that's something to bare in mind.\n\nNot saying they are bad kites. I have full quiver Peaks but there is different kites for different tasks also.\n\nCant really tell your windrange in 110kg sinnce if you go up to mountains/fjells, wind will raise the more up you go.\nYour own skills and preferences affects this alot.\n\nKeeping kite steady at 45degree angle versus looping the shit out of kite to produce power etc...\n\n## Comment ID kxg9z2x with +2 score by [(Bill_S_Preson_Esq, Reddit, 2024-03-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kiteboarding/comments/1bsjchv/gear_advice_peak_5_and_harness/kxg9z2x/) (in reply to ID 1bsjchv):\nIf you're not planning on doing unhooked stuff, then no need for a spreader bar while touring...  Personally I  would recommend a good locking carabiner thru the orange loop on the harness instead of opening your chicken loop safety to get attached. \n\nPeaks depower so well and fly well even when fully depowered(very fluttery tho, looks silly) so I'd recommend sizing up.  You can handle more kite as your skill increases as well!\n\n### Comment ID kxiieyk with +2 score by [(fotoprivat, Reddit, 2024-04-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kiteboarding/comments/1bsjchv/gear_advice_peak_5_and_harness/kxiieyk/) (in reply to ID kxg9z2x):\nWhy the carabiner?

However that's pretty unlikely to happen with modern gear.\n\nAdding a carabineer keeps the plastic chicken loop from rubbing against and cutting into the nylon loop on your harness and it's usually easier to clip/unclip the carabineer than to put the chicken loop back together. That's less of a concern today though with click-in bars.\n\nIt does move the bar slightly further away but I kind of doubt you're in the t-rex arms category were that's a huge concern.\n\n#### Comment ID kxjcuib with +1 score by [(Bill_S_Preson_Esq, Reddit, 2024-04-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kiteboarding/comments/1bsjchv/gear_advice_peak_5_and_harness/kxjcuib/) (in reply to ID kxiieyk):\nEase of clip in.

The messaging in that email is absolutely not normal lmao - the sentiment is, not the actual message. \n\nAnd they made this point on the podcast but if you have people at the org who don't like her and your org has had many failures and issues during her tenure, an email like that that gasses her up to that degree doesn't exactly show how you plan to change things and how the replacement will be different, ya know, the purpose behind changing senior leadership.

The idea that she’s the “CEO” of EG is what was given to her due to the good graces she’s clearly formed with PEAK6 management.

The part I don't get is why Peak6, an investment company, ALSO seems all-in on making it a vanity project for Nicole. RL's article talked about how Jessica Hammond, another executive appointed by P6, was focused entirely on protect Nicole's image, and made that objective a top priority for everyone else too. Now this whole email gassing her up. \n\n\nWhy is Peak6 seemingly more interested in the image of the employee they tasked with overseeing their multi-million dollar investment than they are with the investment itself? She worked with them for just a couple of years before being appointed CEO of EG. Its not like she's head of the whole company.

Nearly every esports organization is in the red, and following the PR disaster caused by poor leadership they've lost multiple sponsors.

Hassan had lodged the complaint arguing that his former organisation had breached their contract when converting stock he held within the company from preferred units to common stock, supposedly without him understanding the gravity of that change. After days of presenting evidence and arguments the jury decided that neither Evil Geniuses – here in the suit under their companies EG LLC, EG Inc and EG Holdings – nor Peak6 had a case to answer.\n\n[...]\n\n>With no ground conceded by either party the matter proceeded to a jury trial where the jurors were given lengthy instructions regarding how to assess each of the claims made against the defendants. Beginning on the 13th February the verdict was officially filed on the 1st March where the claims of breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, false misrepresentation, false promis, breach of fiduciary duty, conversion and unclean hands were all found in favour of Evil Geniuses and Peak6.

The work is highly stimulating and the days fly by (although I do work 10-12 hours a day Monday-Friday).\n2. The compensation is very generous: a first year trader at my firm makes $150-$200k while a full time trader at my firm can make anywhere from $300k-$3M (partners can make more).\n3. The culture is very work hard play hard which for me is a pro.\n4. The people are extremely smart and push each other to work hard, generally trading firms recruit from ivy’s or schools with very strong academics (I personally did not go to an ivy but I did go to a good state school from which many trading firms recruit).\n\nCons:\n1. This was also in the pros list but the days can be long and occasionally quite stressful.\n2. Trading isn’t risk less and firms can go under especially when vol skyrockets like it did in March.\n3. Not much diversity, most of my firm is white or Asian males. Not many women and not many people of color.\n4. Some firms can be highly cutthroat and competitive, thankfully mine is not (that’s not to say it isn’t competitive, but people have the best interests of the firm in mind). However I’ve heard of other firms firing half of their new hires within 6 months of hiring if they don’t perform.\n\n## Comment ID frfgfp0 with +35 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-05-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/goblbv/options_trader_at_a_major_proprietary/frfgfp0/) (in reply to ID goblbv):\nOk, so basically nothing that you do at your firm can actually be used or is relevant outside of it.

Just to name a few. As far as size of the spread, it depends on what other market makers are making they’re spread and the risks associated with each option. I would expect illiquid markets to have wider spreads because the market maker would be taking on higher risk, just like how in after hours the spread is larger because there is less liquidity in the market hence the higher risk.\n\nEdit: as far as what you can do to avoid higher spreads, I would recommend avoiding itm options because I don’t personally see the point in them and they’ll have a higher spread do to higher interest rate risk and larger capital needed (that’s just my opinion), I would stick to atm or only slightly itm (or otm options), also, stick to highly liquid markets if you can because you’ll get burned less on spreads in highly liquid markets.\n\n#### Comment ID frgpswx with +6 score by [(OptionsGeekFelix, Reddit, 2020-05-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/goblbv/options_trader_at_a_major_proprietary/frgpswx/) (in reply to ID frfaj2t):\nNow, this is great advice for the average investor.

This is normally done by opening many small positions that are based on selling far OTM options. Some say implied vol should be elevated, others say it doesn't matter.  The rationale is that since implied vol is *usually* higher than what realized vol will turn out to be, this is an 'edge'.\n\nSeemingly uncorrelated underlyings are chosen, and going short low delta options are usually the main driver of the trade. The expectation is that one should rely on the law of large numbers to let the 'high probabilities' of profit converge to some expected percentage of profitable trades.\n\nExample: \"I only sell credit spreads with a short option delta of 0.2 at most, with a time to exp 30-45DTE.  Therefore, after many small trades, my expected % of profitable trades should be 80% and I expect to be profitable over the long term.\"\n\nFor what it's worth, once I started to understand about the theory, math, and assumptions made in option pricing, I realized approaching options trading like this doesn't seem to generate any appreciable edge.\n\nAnyway, the main reason I say this, is that in another thread a long time ago, it was roughly said that if a retail trader attempted to break into the professional options trading world selling themselves on this type of strategy, they'd be laughed out of the building.\n\nNow I can actually ask a professional options trader: Would they?\n\n### Comment ID frha268 with +7 score by [(traderthroaway124, Reddit, 2020-05-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/goblbv/options_trader_at_a_major_proprietary/frha268/) (in reply to ID frg8g91):\nI don’t think anyone would laugh at your for your strategy especially if it works for you, but I also don’t think that this type of strategy would be used by professional options traders, most market makers try and stay as flat greeks (including volatility) so as to limit their risk and simply continue collecting the bid/ask spread hence why they wouldn’t simply sell volatility. I will say that I think you’re strategy seems more feasible than some of the others I’ve seen being talked about. One thing to be careful of though is that even if you’re chance of profit is 80% on every trade, (and this is pretty obvious) if the 20% of losers are higher then the 80% of winners then it’s not sustainable in the long run.\n\n#### Comment ID frhqiyp with +2 score by [(BrononymousEngineer, Reddit, 2020-05-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/goblbv/options_trader_at_a_major_proprietary/frhqiyp/) (in reply to ID frha268):\nThanks for the reply.  \n\nTo clarify, this isn't my strategy, just speaking from the point of view of what I tend to see discussed often.\n\n## Comment ID frf94wq with +7 score by [(Unlucky-Prize, Reddit, 2020-05-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/goblbv/options_trader_at_a_major_proprietary/frf94wq/) (in reply to ID goblbv):\nUnder what circumstances and conditions if any do you decide you should just turn off your programs?\n\n### Comment ID frf9fp4 with +7 score by [(traderthroaway124, Reddit, 2020-05-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/goblbv/options_trader_at_a_major_proprietary/frf9fp4/) (in reply to ID frf94wq):\nIf I’m pushing my risk limits too much, if I think my options pricing model is innaccurate, if the market is so volatile that I’m getting destroyed(although that almost never happens).

Market making was an area I was interested in out of grad school but i never had the connections to ask questions. I'm curious, at a high level, how did the March-April selloff affect your general strategy? For example, were you forced to rely on your intuition more b/c your models may have less predictive power due to the regime change. You mention diversity as a con but only refer to race.

As far as the March-April sell off, it didn’t affect the core of our strategy but it certainly affected the size we were willing to trade. Suddenly an option that was worth $100 a month previous was worth $1000. I try not to rely too much on intuition and tend to rely more on our core strategy. As far as age diversity, I would agree that it’s generally more of a young person’s game although pit traders are often older guys that have been in the game for many years. \nI haven’t thought all that much about where I would go after trading, maybe get a masters and work in some other sector in finance, maybe work for a tech company, maybe none of the above.\n\n#### Comment ID frfnjit with +3 score by [(speedyg54, Reddit, 2020-05-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/goblbv/options_trader_at_a_major_proprietary/frfnjit/) (in reply to ID frfmi4a):\nThanks for the quick reply.

Underlying price\n2. Time to expiration\n3. Interest rates\n4. Implied vol\n5.

First, I appreciate you coming on. I am also an options expert having traded Volatility at Bank of America. I think a few people have commented already on how what you do is not relevant to them. This is quite important for everyone to understand. You are a market maker (MM) trading vol.  Other traders trading volatility are the IB derivative's traders and a handful of Hedge Funds. All together that group makes up less than 1% of the investors/traders using options. I think you agree with this. 99% of investors don't use options this way. **Now, I'd like you and everyone else to think about something...** there are millions of investors who use options and BUY them. I bet that none of them could answer a simple question (sequence): After you set the expiration, how do you choose the right option to buy? Specifically, why that one and not the higher one or lower one? And how do you prove it's the right one. As an expert yourself, you know that there has never been an answer given to that question. It's the toughest question in options. I don't mean to put you on the spot, but I think the 99% of investors out there need to know what the **REAL PROBLEM** is. It's not them. It's not the teachers.

Maybe it’s HFT related, maybe it’s relative value related, there are plenty of different types of strategy’s out there to pull from, the important thing is making sure it actually works.\n\n## Comment ID frflmo9 with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-05-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/goblbv/options_trader_at_a_major_proprietary/frflmo9/) (in reply to ID goblbv):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID frhdubw with +6 score by [(traderthroaway124, Reddit, 2020-05-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/goblbv/options_trader_at_a_major_proprietary/frhdubw/) (in reply to ID frflmo9):\nHey sorry I missed your questions.

For full time traders the salary range is 150k-250k and the bonus can sometimes be as much as 10x the salary. In my experience firms will put there best traders in their best products (which makes sense) although there is a decent amount of rotating between desks for younger traders. For my firm it’s rare that our traders trade against each other, also, the way bonus are paid out is very tied to firm performance so generally traders aren’t competing for PnL (so long as they generate value).\n\n## Comment ID frj06qj with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-05-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/goblbv/options_trader_at_a_major_proprietary/frj06qj/) (in reply to ID goblbv):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID frj0cuq with +2 score by [(traderthroaway124, Reddit, 2020-05-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/goblbv/options_trader_at_a_major_proprietary/frj0cuq/) (in reply to ID frj06qj):\nNot sure what option city is so I’m gonna go ahead and say no.

Also staying small with position sizing so that even if those fatter tails come into the equation we are limited to the downside of our p/l.\n\nIt is encouraging to see your comment about being profitable selling options!

IT teams are very disorganized and poorly funded and supported. Finance teams lack real strong talent and do whatever they want contrary to accounting principles. HR only protects the owners and is very much in bed with bad managers. Workday rollout was chaotic because no one knew what they were doing and didn’t work well together. There’s a culture of form over substance, where form is overwhelmingly rewarded at the expense of good performers. Fun and challenging work is hoarded for favorites who make mistakes and are excused, but non-favorites somehow get blamed for company performance. The owners either don’t have a clue how toxic their own firm is or don’t care, either way they subscribe to outdated methods of work from the 1980s/90s and want people to sit straight at their desks w/o getting up 4-5 days a week in an office they purposely make cold to “make you work harder”. Compensation is also disproportionate depending who you ask, and headcount is kept far too secret for that purpose in the name of “confidentiality and protecting employees”.",

It is a 25 year old company with a start up mentality, decisions made quickly and you must be able to be agile and pivot. It is a place that you can have ten different careers and never have to leave. It is not for everyone and that is said from the start. Its for those that have an entrepreneur spirit, a passion for working hard and adding value, have a sense of humor, love to learn and grow, thrive in being challenged - personally and professionally, geek out on solving problems, and okay with having very active and passionate founders. The people are amazing and endless opportunity to try new things.",

Why do I say loyalists? Because this place wants to be a cult. It just doesn’t have any leadership to follow through.

The company obviously places more importance on loyalty than on merit, which is something the CPD would surely applaud.",

          "adviceOriginal": null,
          "cons": "I will speak from my own experience but for context, I was laid off this year in February. I decided to not write a glassdoor review at that point in time-- my round of layoffs were done hastily and were, in my opinion, handled quite poorly, but I just assumed this was an outlier experience. Even reading the not so stunning reviews on here, I assumed most negative comments were from very disgruntled employees, and I wanted to give Peak 6 the benefit of the doubt. That being said, after the most recent round of layoffs in September, it's clear my experience was not an outlier. Here are my red flags/tips for prospective employees: 1) Most managers will look at you sideways if you're not pursuing 3-5 side projects at a time OUTSIDE OF your normal work responsibilities. If you are not an overachiever willing to work 2+ hours a day outside normal hours, you likely won't be seen as a satisfactory employee. 2) Avoid taking anything management says at face value. If you are not propelled onto a trading team within your first 2 years, your job is on the line, plain and simple. Managers never allude to this clear fact, instead choosing to spout truisms about how having time to manage your own portfolio and experiment is vital to your career…..but guess who are the first people to be laid off? At best, it’s terrible communication and hasty decision-making made by upper-management, who then spring the news of layoffs onto lower level managers who are powerless to give their opinions and vouch for their employees who are at this, quote, “important” stage in their trading development. At worst? It’s willful miscommunication and manipulation on management’s part, hoping to squeeze out all of your energy and effort into working more, in fear that you’ll be laid off next. 3) Change happens at a disorienting level. The firm probably describes it as “dynamic adaptability” or some other corporate BS, but the reality is that management doesn’t know what they’re doing and are just throwing anything at the wall to see what sticks. This is, of course, always to the detriment of employees’ precious time and energy. Teams are made and dissolved within months. Projects will be abandoned in the middle and never mentioned again. Management is constantly shuffling and structurally reorganizing for no clear reason.",

People on the outside see the company structure and the unbelievable employee turnover (ie, a handful of veteran employees, then everyone else only being there for 5 years or less), and it reflects poorly on your business.",
        "cons": "I will speak from my own experience but for context, I was laid off this year in February. I decided to not write a glassdoor review at that point in time-- my round of layoffs were done hastily and were, in my opinion, handled quite poorly, but I just assumed this was an outlier experience. Even reading the not so stunning reviews on here, I assumed most negative comments were from very disgruntled employees, and I wanted to give Peak 6 the benefit of the doubt. That being said, after the most recent round of layoffs in September, it's clear my experience was not an outlier. Here are my red flags/tips for prospective employees: 1) Most managers will look at you sideways if you're not pursuing 3-5 side projects at a time OUTSIDE OF your normal work responsibilities. If you are not an overachiever willing to work 2+ hours a day outside normal hours, you likely won't be seen as a satisfactory employee. 2) Avoid taking anything management says at face value. If you are not propelled onto a trading team within your first 2 years, your job is on the line, plain and simple. Managers never allude to this clear fact, instead choosing to spout truisms about how having time to manage your own portfolio and experiment is vital to your career…..but guess who are the first people to be laid off? At best, it’s terrible communication and hasty decision-making made by upper-management, who then spring the news of layoffs onto lower level managers who are powerless to give their opinions and vouch for their employees who are at this, quote, “important” stage in their trading development. At worst? It’s willful miscommunication and manipulation on management’s part, hoping to squeeze out all of your energy and effort into working more, in fear that you’ll be laid off next. 3) Change happens at a disorienting level. The firm probably describes it as “dynamic adaptability” or some other corporate BS, but the reality is that management doesn’t know what they’re doing and are just throwing anything at the wall to see what sticks. This is, of course, always to the detriment of employees’ precious time and energy. Teams are made and dissolved within months. Projects will be abandoned in the middle and never mentioned again. Management is constantly shuffling and structurally reorganizing for no clear reason.",

Compensation within the first 1-2 years is also good, and the office is in a beautiful and historic building.",

HR only protects the owners and is very much in bed with bad managers. Workday rollout was chaotic because no one knew what they were doing and didn’t work well together. There’s a culture of form over substance, where form is overwhelmingly rewarded at the expense of good performers. Fun and challenging work is hoarded for favorites who make mistakes and are excused, but non-favorites somehow get blamed for company performance. The owners either don’t have a clue how toxic their own firm is or don’t care, either way they subscribe to outdated methods of work from the 1980s/90s and want people to sit straight at their desks w/o getting up 4-5 days a week in an office they purposely make cold to “make you work harder”.

The industries we choose to work in come with unique challenges that other markets and fields refuse to take on, but that only resolves us to push ourselves beyond expectations. This mandates a work culture that’s not for the faint of heart but demands a heart of gold to see the success around you. We see ambiguity as opportunity. We see direct, honest feedback as a way to get better, not crumble. We’re ambitious because we want to be razor-sharp for what we’ll tackle tomorrow. And transparently, sometimes there’s disruption because we take challenges head-on in groundbreaking ways. When you’re hungry to democratize the world, brave enough to truly change the status quo, and smart enough to know the power of a team, you’re ready to be a PEAK6er.\n\nRadical honesty is essential at PEAK6. This is the place to do great things, make a difference, and hone your skills in ways that benefit both you and the company. Are you ready to level up?",

Instead of receiving points for future purchases, customers would receive fractional shares, creating a personal portfolio for investing in companies they support.\n\n“It’s all about the democratization of finance. How do we get the masses thinking about investing because it’s so important to building wealth…I think [stock rewards/fractional shares] is going to be an incredible opportunity for Wall Street to come to Main Street in a really tangible way. Oftentimes, we talk about skiing — you read about skiing in a book, and it’s not the same thing, right? You have to get out there and do it. And we need people to experience buying and selling a stock.”\n\nIn bringing investment into spaces where a new audience can interact with it, building wealth becomes increasingly accessible for everyone.\n\nPaving the way for women in the trading world through poker\n\nWhen her daughter was fourteen, Just gathered a group of ten girls and their moms to learn the game of poker. The growth in strategy and confidence she saw around that table was so moving that it inspired Just to create Poker Power, an organization that fosters the growth of critical decision-making and negotiation skills in women and other marginalized groups by teaching them poker.\n\n“Poker’s been around for hundreds of years – our presidents, our tech leaders, our heads of law firms, countless people use this game, and for me, the three most important skills it can teach you are how to take risk, strategy, and capital allocation.”\n\nPoker Power sessions have now been held at over 300 companies and organizations in 60 countries.\n\nThe power of taking risks\n\nTo close the conversation Just explores the importance of knowing oneself as a risk taker and how to balance saying yes and no to opportunities that may or may not aid future careers.\n\nWant to hear more from Ross students, faculty, and alumni?\n\nCheck out more of our podcasts.\n\nBusiness Beyond Usual: Full-time MBA students at Michigan Ross tackle burning issues on campus and the world beyond.

      "# [Visionary Fintech Entrepreneur Jenny Just to Receive Honorary Doctor of Business from Illinois Tech on 2024-05-11](https://www.iit.edu/news/visionary-fintech-entrepreneur-jenny-just-receive-honorary-doctor-business-illinois-tech)\nCHICAGO—May 11, 2024—Illinois Institute of Technology (Illinois Tech) will award Jenny Just, a renowned entrepreneur and one of the few self-made female billionaires in the United States, an Honorary Doctor of Business, honoris causa. After cutting her teeth on the trading floor in Chicago, Just launched her own investment firm and transformed it into a fintech empire, including more than 15 companies that she has started or helped turn around.\n\n“I am deeply honored to receive this recognition from Illinois Tech,” said Just. “It’s a humbling tribute to my work, and it also serves as a powerful motivator for the future. I’m committed to using my platform to continue advocating for educational equity and inspiring the next generation of leaders, especially women, to pursue their aspirations, goals, and dreams.”\n\nJust co-founded PEAK6 in 1997 with $1.5 million in seed capital, initially focusing on proprietary options trading. Under her leadership, PEAK6 has evolved into a multibillion-dollar financial services and technology empire, housing the next generation of products and service brands, including PEAK6 Capital Management, PEAK6 Strategic Capital, Apex Fintech Solutions, Apex Crypto, and PEAK6 InsurTech, as well as esports franchise Evil Geniuses and financial literacy app Zogo.\n\n“Jenny Just exemplifies Illinois Tech’s spirit of innovation and leadership,” said Illinois Tech President Raj Echambadi. “Her profound impact on the finance industry and her unwavering commitment to raising up others inspires our whole university community.”\n\nWith a true knack for unearthing talent and opportunities, Just looks for underfunded and underappreciated sectors to transform into high-growth businesses. Her passion specifically lies in finding opportunities for women to succeed at every table—from the classroom, to the conference room, to the poker room, to the board room.\n\nIn 2020 Jenny Just and her daughter Juliette launched Poker Power, a woman-led company that teaches poker to all who identify as female, and by extension, teaches strategic thinking, capital allocation, and decision-making skills. Additionally, Just has continued to create programs to help women advance their careers, including the Women’s Trading Experience and Women’s Technology Experience.\n\n“I can’t think of a better role model for our students than Jenny Just,” said Liad Wagman, dean of the Stuart School of Business. “Jenny Just embodies the innovativeness, strategic thinking, and determination required to make a tremendous impact in the business world. Her commitment to harnessing untapped market opportunities, leveraging technology for inclusive business success, and lifting others up, are inspirations for current and future leaders.”\n\nJust received a B.B.A in Business, Management, Marketing, and Related Support Services from the Stephen M. Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan in 1990.\n\nJust’s honorary degree will be conferred during Illinois Tech’s 155th Commencement ceremony on May 11, 2024 at Credit Union 1 Arena.\n\nPhoto: Jenny Just\n\nIllinois Institute of Technology\n\nBased in the global metropolis of Chicago, Illinois Tech was born to liberate the power of collective difference to advance technology and innovation for all. It is the only tech-focused university in the city, and it stands at the crossroads of exploration and invention, advancing the future of Chicago and the world. It offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in engineering, computing, architecture, business, design, science and human sciences, and law. Illinois Tech students are guaranteed access to hands-on experiences, personalized mentorship, and job readiness through the university's one-of-a-kind Elevate program.

      "# [PEAK6 Investments LLC](https://www.marketswiki.com/wiki/PEAK6_Investments_LLC)\nPEAK6 Investments is a financial services firm located in Chicago that includes market making, risk management, a hedge fund and proprietary trading operations.[1][2] Peak6's core brands include: PEAK6 Capital Management, Apex Clearing, National Flood Services and Evil Geniuses, an esports business.\n\nThe company's first tech-based solution was developed in 1997 to optimize options trading and, over the past two decades, the same formula has been used across a range of industries, asset classes and business stages.\n\nIts subsidiary PEAK6 Capital Management is a major options market maker and proprietary trading firm, which the firm says is one of the largest options trading operations in the U.S.[3] PEAK6 also launched options news and information service The Options News Network, or ONN.tv in September 2008.[4]\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nPEAK6 was founded over 25 years ago by co-founders Jenny Just and Matt Hulsizer. Their journey started as options traders at O'Connor and Associates in Chicago, where they gained experience and a knack for taking calculated risks. When O'Connor and Associates relocated to the East Coast, Just and Hulsizer chose to remain in Chicago.\n\nPEAK6 began as a proprietary equity options trading firm. It leveraged its trading profits to fund various ventures, embracing opportunities with a focus on learning from each experience, regardless of success. As markets evolved, PEAK6 launched OptionsHouse, a hedge fund and retail broker-dealer, setting the stage for a pivotal moment.\n\nWhen the custodian and clearing firm for OptionsHouse, Penson Financial Services, faced bankruptcy, PEAK6 stepped in, acquiring what would become Apex Fintech Solutions.[5] This move not only saved OptionsHouse but also positioned PEAK6 as a technology-forward disruptor in the industry. Brokerage firms seeking modern technology solutions soon partnered with PEAK6.\n\nIts OptionsHouse, LLC subsidiary was rated among the best brokers for options traders by Barron's in March of 2009.[6] However, OptionsHouse was acquired by E*Trade on September 12, 2016 for $725 million.[7]\n\nOver the years, PEAK6 diversified its portfolio with ventures and acquisitions spanning cryptocurrency, esports, finance education, and more. The firm also has a simulated trading facility called WeSeed LLC (or www.WeSeed.com), which provides beginner traders with a platform to learn how to trade stocks.\n\nPEAK6 also has interests in financial technology firms Stockgroup and ELX Electronic Liquidity Exchange and invests in and runs hedge funds.[8] Its subsidiary PEAK6 Capital Management is an options market maker and proprietary trading firm.\n\nIn September 2014 the company said it would spin out its $2.3 billion hedge-fund business, Peak6 Advisors, which would change its name to Achievement Asset Management and focus on growth by trading European credit and stocks out of a new London office. The renamed business will continue to be led by CEO Joseph Scoby, who will buy out the roughly 50% stake in the hedge-fund business that Peak6 Investments owns.[9]\n\nIn September 2020 BBC News reported PEAKS6 was looking to add an office in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The company said it planned to create 160 new jobs in Northern Ireland over four years, with the help of more than £1m of support from Invest Northern Ireland. [10] [11]\n\nIn 2007, PEAK6 Investments was listed as one of \"Chicago's 101 Best And Brightest Companies To Work For.\"[12]\n\nAt the end of 2024 it was reported that PEAK6 would be leaving Chicago and move to Austin, TX.

Originally dealing in options proprietary trading, it has expanded into other businesses most notably investment management and fintech.\n\nPEAK6 places emphasis on Diversity, equity, and inclusion.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1997, Peak6 was founded in Chicago by Matt Hulsizer and Jenny Just who were previously options traders O'Connor & Associates. They left after O'Connor was acquired by UBS and the new venture was funded by $1.5 million in seed capital from partners at O'Connor, friends and family.[1]\n\nPeak6 achieved early success by options proprietary trading and used the profits to profits to expand its business.[1] In 2006, Peak6 launched OptionsHouse, an online options and equities brokerage platform. Peak6 also launched a hedge fund.[2]\n\nIn May 2012, Penson Worldwide which owned the clearing and custody firm used to settle trades and hold assets for OptionsHouse asked to borrow money from Peak6 as it was close to bankruptcy. Peak6 then paid $60 million to acquire Penson's clearing business which was formed as an new entity, Apex Clearing (now known as Apex Fintech Solutions).[1]\n\nIn 2014, Peak6 sold OptionsHouse to General Atlantic for $200 million.[2] In September that year, Peak6 spun out its $2.3 billion hedge fund as Achievement Asset Management.[3]\n\nBy 2015, various fintech firms such as Robinhood Markets, Wealthfront, Betterment and Stash had started using Apex. Apex also expanded into powering digital wealth management and in 2018, started offering cryptocurrency services.[1]\n\nPeak6 has attempted to lessen the gender imbalance at the company. In 2016, it launched an intern program called \"Trading Experience for Women\". Initially it began with 7 women in the program and by 2021 it had trained 40 women since inception leading to 35% of Peak6's traders being female. In 2018, Peak6 added a software engineering internship for women and in 2021, added a product internship for women. Peak6 has also launched an outside venture in June 2020 named Poker Power, which aims to teach a million women to play Texas Hold'em.[1]\n\nIn September 2020, BBC News reported Peak6 was looking to add an office in Belfast, Northern Ireland that would create 160 jobs. Invest Northern Ireland has offered more than £1 million in support.[4]\n\nIn February 2021, Peak6 announced that it planned to list Apex on the New York Stock Exchange via a SPAC merger with Jon Ledecky's Northern Star Investment Corp. II which would value Apex at $4.7 billion.[1][5] However, by December 2021, the plan was withdrawn mainly due to scrutiny by the regulators which led to a $1.5 million by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.[5] In December 2023, it was reported that Apex had filed for a traditional IPO listing.[6]\n\nIn December 2024, it was reported that Peak6 would move its headquarters from Chicago to Austin, Texas.[7]\n\nNotable investments\n\n[edit]\n\nPeak6 has been noted to make investments in football clubs. Previous investments include AS Roma,[8]Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.,[8] AFC Bournemouth[9] and Dundalk F.C.[10]\n\nIn May 2019, Peak6 acquired esports organization Evil Geniuses with Peak6 employee Nicole LaPointe Jameson becoming its CEO. In August 2023, Her tenure had multiple controversies and in August 2023 Jameson stepped down from her post.[11] Sumail sued Evil Geniuses and Peak6 in December 2021 over contract negotiations and stock ownership which related to Peak6's acquisition terms. In March 2024, the jury sided with Evil Geniuses and Peak6.[12]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nProprietary trading\n\nEvil Geniuses",
