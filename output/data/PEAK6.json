      "# [About PEAK6 – Our Origin Story and Our Founders on 2022-06-21](https://peak6.com/about/)\nJenny Just is a visionary, powerhouse, and one of the few self-made female billionaires in the United States. From the days of cutting her teeth on the trading floor in Chicago to now running a fintech empire, she has started and/or turned around more than fifteen companies.\n\nJenny co-founded PEAK6 in 1997 with $1.5M in seed capital as a proprietary options trading firm and since then has grown it into a multibillion-dollar financial services and technology giant housing the next generation of products & service brands including PEAK6 Capital Management, PEAK6 Strategic Capital, Apex Fintech Solutions, Team Focus Insurance Group, We Insure, Evil Geniuses, and Zogo.\n\nWith a true knack for unearthing talent and opportunities, Jenny looks for underfunded and underappreciated sectors to transform into high-growth businesses. Her passion specifically lies in finding opportunities for women to succeed at every table — from the classroom, to the conference room, to the poker room, to the boardroom.\n\nThis passion led her to launch Poker Power in 2020 with her daughter Juliette, a woman-led company that teaches poker to all who identify as female, and by extension, teaches women strategic thinking, capital allocation, and decision-making skills. Additionally, Jenny has created programs to help women advance their careers including the Women’s Trading Experience and Women’s Technology Experience. She currently serves on the Women and Public Policy Board at the Harvard Kennedy School.\n\nJenny’s remarkable success has earned her a number of accolades, including being named to Forbes’ list of America’s Richest Self-Made Women, Forbes 50 over 50 and Worth’s Groundbreaking Women. She was also the recipient of the Women’s Poker Association’s Industry Innovation Recognition Award and received a Tony Award for her involvement in Memphis the Musical.\n\nMatthew Hulsizer is co-founder and managing partner of PEAK6 Investments, a Chicago-based financial services and technology firm. He started PEAK6 in 1997 as a proprietary options trading firm — PEAK6 Capital Management.

Today, PEAK6’s core businesses include PEAK6 Capital Management, PEAK6 Strategic Capital, Apex Fintech Solutions, Team Focus Insurance Group, We Insure, Evil Geniuses, Zogo, and Poker Power.\n\nHulsizer has a knack for discovering underfunded and undervalued opportunities with potential to transform the future. While sports are his passion, spotting and coaching up-and-coming talent is his calling. Through his investment prowess and mentorship, he has helped budding investors and founders build impressive businesses from fruition to completion. Hulsizer and his co-founder have created, turned around, or invested in more than 200 companies — from options trading and clearing firms to professional sports teams and consumer products — over the past two decades.

Our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion is paramount to driving new ideas and ensuring a company culture where all team members feel safe and encouraged to be their authentic selves.\n\nOur efforts go beyond the walls of PEAK6 offices, however. We’ve also established initiatives to develop and nurture talent to help people from all walks of life and enhance the industry. This is a core part of our mission, and of what defines PEAK6.\n\nThe DEI Council\n\nWe recognize that, in order to meet employee needs, we should turn to the employees themselves. That’s why PEAK6 launched its DEI Council.\n\nBy its nature, the DEI Council will always be a work in progress. Made up of diverse voices across multiple PEAK6 businesses, the team meets regularly and consults with leaders on important, impactful decisions.\n\n“I think it’s really important to be open, learn from each other, and think about things from new or changed perspectives,” says Carrie Lang, Agency Development Coordinator at National Flood Services and member of the Council’s Leadership Team. “It’s beneficial to listen and learn about other people’s experiences and goals here at PEAK6.”\n\nAdditionally, the council aims to not shy away from difficult conversations, so as to inspire a more productive and open work environment.\n\nFintech in Action\n\nIn 2020, PEAK6 provided initial funds to start Fintech in Action (FIA), a coalition seeking to increase the pipeline of Black professionals through partnerships with over 30 companies committed to promoting hiring, growth, and retention. PEAK6 continues to be a proud member of the coalition.\n\n“From an economic equity perspective, there is catching up to do,” says FIA Executive Director Michelle Williams. “There are stark disparities that exist in the finance and technology industries that need to change.”\n\nDiverse backgrounds lead to diverse ideas, and FIA aims to bring those to the finance and fintech industries. True to its name, FIA goes beyond words and takes action, including making a $1 million donation to the Greenwood Project, a Black-led 501(c)(3) organization that creates career pathways for Black, Latinx, and underrepresented students.\n\nFIA also helps fund paid internships for start-ups and mid-sized firms. They’ve even reached high school students with Money Camp, an online program providing a high-level overview of stock market and trading practices, in collaboration with National Urban League and Rapunzl Investments.\n\n“I have seen first-hand that PEAK6 is committed to changing the landscape of finance,” says Williams. “The work FIA does is supported by a larger culture of change agents and cheerleaders that have only empowered this initiative to grow.”\n\nResources and Opportunities for PEAK6 Employees\n\nWe encourage all PEAK6 team members to dedicate themselves to fostering growth and change in the workplace. Employees can join a voluntary Employee Resource Group based around ethnicity, gender, lifestyle, and interests. And the DEI Council General Assembly is open to all PEAK6 employees to provide feedback and suggestions to the council.\n\nThe most important thing our employees can do, however, is to bring themselves authentically and completely to work each day. Our team is composed of the brightest minds and most dedicated workers from all backgrounds, and the more we embrace that, the better results we can achieve.",
      "# [A History of PEAK6 by bculhane@peak6.com on 2024-01-11](https://peak6.com/a-history-of-peak6/)\nFor over 25 years, PEAK6 has been changing the way the fintech industry does business. Co-founders Jenny Just and Matt Hulsizer have continually pushed forward with innovation and custom solutions to help create a brighter, stronger, and more robust future — for everyone. Here’s the story of how PEAK6 came to be.\n\nThe Beginning\n\nBefore Jenny and Matt were entrepreneurs, they were options traders for O’Connor and Associates in Chicago. They had several opportunities to learn from pivotal partnerships and industry legends, giving them the tools to build up their business knowledge and savviness. They learned to trust their instincts and to never pass up an opportunity if they had the chance to take it. And, most importantly, they learned that taking calculated risks was vital to business success.\n\nWhen O’Connor and Associates made the decision to move business to the East Coast, Jenny and Matt had decisions to make. They wanted to stay in Chicago, and even pitched opening a new line of business in Chicago to the executive team. O’Connor and Associates declined the pitch, leading Jenny and Matt to rethink their career paths and how they could create something that worked better for them. “There’s a better way” became the theme of their vision — and still is today.\n\nForging a New Path\n\nThere were many ideas and factors that went into the founding of PEAK6. Starting as a proprietary equity options trading firm, Jenny and Matt built a team and used the money made from trading to fuel other, new ventures through PEAK6. Together, they knew they could accomplish almost anything as long as they put their heads together and saw an opportunity.\n\nSome of those opportunities did not get fully realized, but the chance of calculated risk-taking was always well worth it. Jenny and Matt knew it was important to learn by doing, and the lessons and insights earned from each venture mattered just as much as its success. Those opportunities still had plenty of benefits.\n\nGrowth and Embracing Change\n\nAs the markets began to change, PEAK6 built OptionsHouse, a hedge fund and retail broker-dealer. This led to many opportunities for the firm, but a critical moment arose when Jenny and Matt received a call from the CEO of Penson Financial Services, the custodian and clearing firm for OptionsHouse.\n\nThe clearing firm was nearing bankruptcy, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) were calling for a sale. Penson needed tens of millions of dollars to cover their business losses within two weeks, and they were asking PEAK6 for assistance. Jenny and Matt knew this was an opportunity they didn’t want to pass up, and for more than one reason — the future of OptionsHouse was in the hands of Penson.\n\nPEAK6 acquired what would become Apex Fintech Solutions from Penson, helping save OptionHouse in the process. The company structure was refreshed, and new account-opening technology was developed to better serve PEAK6 and OptionsHouse customers — putting PEAK6 ahead of most other players that used outdated technology. Soon, brokerage firms looking to disrupt their industries signed on with PEAK6 and its contemporary technology.\n\nBuilt to Innovate in the Present and Future\n\nPEAK6 had now permanently changed its identity in the business and technology worlds. PEAK6 was the company that enabled disruptors to disrupt their industry — with no plans to stop any time soon. Throughout the years more business ventures and acquisitions have occurred, from cryptocurrency to esports to empowering women through poker to an app offering finance education lessons to offices across the U.S. and Europe.\n\nVentures and Acquisitions Include:\n\nCapital Management, 1997\n\nApex Clearing, 2012\n\nStrategic Capital, 2015\n\nNational Flood Services, 2018\n\nApex Crypto, 2018\n\nEvil Geniuses, 2019\n\nBelfast Office, 2019\n\nKairos, 2019\n\nHardcastle Trading, 2020\n\nPoker Power, 2020\n\nZogo, 2021\n\nSilver, 2021\n\nTeam Focus Insurance, 2021\n\nWe Insure, 2021\n\nCODA Markets, 2021\n\nSince its inception, PEAK6 has pushed forward to innovate what ought to be into stagnant industries, as Jenny and Matt north star provides the business with the guidance to never follow the status quo. The firm is now bigger than could have ever been imagined at its inception in 1997, and it continues to grow and expand both externally and internally. Teams are highly collaborative — and competitive, always striving to best themselves while bettering those around them. New technologies and tools, such as artificial intelligence (AI), are always being evaluated to see how PEAK6 can further disrupt the fintech industry — and build a better world.\n\nThis can be seen in PEAK6’s newest department, Applied AI, to innovate ways to automate everyday tasks so teams can free up time and energy to bring new possibilities to life.",

      "# [5 Lessons Poker Taught Me by Carlos Casarez on 2022-11-08](https://peak6.com/5-lessons-poker-taught-me/)\nBy Erin Lydon, Managing Director | Poker Power\n\nPoker Power’s Managing Director, Erin Lydon celebrates Women’s Equality Day with a personal essay about the lessons she’s learned from the felt.\n\n“As I reflect on the last 25 years as a woman of Wall Street, an equal pay champion, start-up leader, and most importantly, mother of young women, I am in awe of the female collective for continuing to strive to do better, to do more. But our work is not done.\n\nWhen I began my career in a male-dominated field, I knew there would be challenges, but just how many, I could never imagine nor how ill-prepared I was to face them. Now, returning from speaking at the AWS Leadership Summit, where I was a part of a larger discussion, engaged with powerful women in tech running game-changing businesses, I can see my work coming full circle. There are still limited seats, and many where women deserve to be sitting. I learned that my seat wouldn’t always be waiting for me, that more often than not, I’d have to bring my own chair. Within the last few years, I learned a game that has changed the way I problem solve and make decisions, giving me the confidence to sit at some of the most prominent tables.\n\nI wasn’t always a poker player, but once I learned the core principles, I was amazed at how seamlessly the strategies translated into my working and personal life. Here are five valuable lessons poker taught me.\n\nPlan Your Moment\n\nIf meditation teaches you to calm your mind, poker teaches you how to restrain it. Like in business, poker enforces the notion that timing truly is everything and it’s important to know how and when to make your move. Take calculated risks when the odds are in your favor and know when to walk away when your hand or the situation isn’t serving you.\n\nRelationship Building\n\nCreating strategic relationships can transform your environment. So much of poker relies on your ability to understand how to read others; their emotional cues, tells, frustrations, and propensity for withholding information. When you learn how to read others and anticipate their moves, you can better understand the possible outcomes of your decision-making. Empathy, a skill that’s highly valued in interpersonal relationships, is something more and more employers look for in candidates, and it can be nurtured by mindful engagement.\n\nCelebrating Accomplishments\n\nA winning hand feels great and celebrating is half the fun. Accomplishments, big or small, deserve recognition and praise – for yourself and others. Celebrating the wins and learning from the losses builds character and insight for the next endeavor. Women who support other women’s success create thriving, inclusive cultures. Amplify innovative ideas and always give credit where it’s due.\n\nPractice Makes Power\n\nIn poker, the bets you make are your voice, and speaking up takes practice. When your gut tells you to share that next great idea, go for it! So often we think about it, but don’t articulate it in front of others. Embrace the moment, push through your trepidation, and use the opportunity to play big. Just like in poker, it’s not about the outcome as much as it’s about having the courage and conviction to make the best move in the moment. Soon, your confidence increases, your voice grows steadier, and you’ll worry less about the risk of losing or making a misstep.\n\nBet on Yourself\n\nGreat reward is often preceded by great risk, but when it comes to you and your success, there’s nothing more important. Whether you’re negotiating a raise, staying firm on the price of a home, or acquiring a new business contract, evaluate the strength of your hand, analyze your options and put yourself in the most advantageous position. To put it into poker jargon, when you negotiate, strive to sit ‘on the button’ and not ‘under-the-gun.’ Thoughtful evaluation, understanding the big picture and prioritizing your loss vs. gain, will help you move forward with confidence and competence.\n\nToday, on Women’s Equality Day, I’m challenging each and every one of you to use your voice, be confident in your decisions, take big risks, and go all-in…at the poker table and in life.”",
      "# [Want more women involved in fintech? by Carlos Casarez on 2020-11-17](https://peak6.com/want-more-women-involved-in-fintech/)\nA scant 26% of computing-related jobs are held by women, according to BuiltIn. PEAK6 is dedicated to making change. In 2018, PEAK6 launched the Technology Experience for Women, an internship program designed to introduce women engineers to the fintech industry and set them up for success in it. We sat down with Luke Peeler, development lead, Devin Barnas and Lauren McCormack, campus recruiters, to learn more about the program.\n\nWhat are the goals of the internship?\n\nLauren: We want to increase involvement of women in the fintech space. Show them how to knock down walls, demystify the environment, teach them what it takes to be successful, and, of course, create a funnel into our employee recruiting.\n\nWe’re advocating for inclusion and exploration—inviting women in tech to come check out a market they may not have considered.\n\nWhat are the challenges of getting women into fintech?\n\nDevin: One challenge is simply lack of awareness to great opportunities in fintech. There is already a shortage of women in the software engineering space, and women with overlapping interest in fintech are an even smaller subset. But when we get them in here to experience the fintech space, learn about our business context and domain, see what they can do, meet other women in the cohort, and add our social programming, it’s a win-win.\n\nHow was the Technology Experience for Women internship developed?\n\nLuke: It was 2018. We had just wrapped up the first year of our Trading Experience for Women. That program was the brainchild of PEAK6 co-founder Jenny Just. After we had our first class of female trading interns, Jenny set the course for rolling the program out in tech. Our 2021 intern class will be our fourth year for tech, and our fifth year for trading. https://www.youtube.com/embed/zTT3ff5HtL0\n\nWhat types of projects do interns work on?\n\nDevin: Our interns work in pairs on a specific project. They also have mentors guiding them and helping them execute the project, while also focusing on learning and growth. It’s different from what they’ve been doing in school. They’re building innovative tools to integrate with our proprietary trading platform—like tooling for low-latency market data streams, a data dependency framework and visualization tool, or an analytics framework and visualization tool for application usage.\n\nIt isn’t neatly packaged and well-defined like their coursework. A piece of software might have millions of dollars flowing through it. We are helping our interns understand that scale, and see how consequential their contributions will be.\n\nLuke: As an example, a recent class of interns worked on a project designed to help app creators learn more about users’ habits with regard to their apps through data. They did a final presentation for the tech team and all the senior leaders at PEAK6 about the project, Stlatlas. That project combined a platform for collecting stats and reviewing the pipeline, with a new tool our then-interns Youmna Rabie and Xizi Yang built to visualize the data. It is now a functional app for our organization. [Read about recent interns and Animal Crossing aficionados Youmna and Xizi]\n\nVirtual internship? What was that like? Lauren: We did our best to mimic what we would have done in person. We had options education, social events, and tried to create a very similar experience virtually. We still gave our interns exposure to the portfolio of companies at PEAK6. They still worked in teams on projects and gave final presentations to leaders. We were especially creative about our social events. We had a virtual magic show. Devin designed a PEAK6 version of Nailed It, where interns created a design on top of a microwavable cake. We had virtual office tours, happy hours, game nights, a virtual escape room.\n\nWhat technologies do interns explore? Luke: They have opportunities to work with a variety of languages and frameworks, such as Java, Python, Go, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and React, and technologies such as MS SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, Airflow, Kafka, Kubernetes and Docker.\n\nWho should apply?\n\nWomen who have:\n\na graduation date between December 2021 and June 2022 in a bachelor’s or master’s program in computer science, electrical or computer engineering, or a related discipline\n\nsoftware development skills in a modern, object-oriented programming language such as Java, Python, or Go, and the ability to learn new languages and technologies quickly\n\ncuriosity to learn and a drive to improve\n\nability to thrive in collaborative environments\n\neffective communication skills\n\ndemonstrated leadership ability",

This new service – via Apex Crypto, a separate entity – is expected to be available starting in the fourth quarter of 2018.\n\nBroker-dealers and other online investing platforms working with Apex Clearing will be able to offer access to crypto investing with a client experience that we believe is unmatched in the industry. While the assets will be held separately from a legal and regulatory standpoint, the processes of opening accounts and making transfers between the entities will be significantly simplified and is being designed to provide the end-investor with a convenient and seamless experience.\n\n“Demand continues to surge for crypto, and Apex is meeting the needs of tech savvy investors by providing the seamless investing experience they want and expect,” said Bill Capuzzi, CEO of Apex Clearing. “We are helping our clients break down barriers to provide the speed, efficiency and flexibility they need to serve the next generation of investors.”\n\nApex Crypto will offer a robust range of coins, including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Litecoin, among others, and plan to add additional currencies based on retail demand. Through Apex Crypto’s proprietary technology, investors will also have access to quotes and market data with transparent pricing and unique statements and confirmations for their digital currency holdings.\n\nCryptocurrencies have become an increasingly popular asset class for new investors. Bitcoin, the most popular of more than 1,600 available currencies, holds a value of about $100 billion in current circulation. Until now, the process to invest in both brokerage assets and crypto has been disjointed; the launch of Apex Crypto seeks to make it frictionless for the investors served by Apex Clearing clients.\n\nPEAK6 Investments L.P., which owns both Apex Clearing and Apex Crypto, invests in and operates financial, technology, and consumer businesses. PEAK6 has an established track record of successfully leading transformations where its combination of capital and operating expertise can accelerate business growth. PEAK6 has a deep history in fintech, including building OptionsHouse which was sold to General Atlantic and later to E*TRADE.\n\nAbout Apex Clearing Corporation",
      "# [Six Winter Holidays Around the World by Carlos Casarez on 2022-12-21](https://peak6.com/six-winter-holidays-around-the-world/)\nWinter is full of many holidays and cultural and familial traditions. It’s certainly a time when many come together to celebrate family, love, and good fortune. Read on to see how some cultures are celebrating this winter.\n\nKwanzaa — A Celebration of Culture\n\nSince 1966, Kwanzaa has been observed by African people around the world the week between Christmas and New Year’s Day. During Kwanzaa, people give each other gifts, but no deities are involved. Kwanzaa is a seven-day ceremony celebrating the New Year’s first harvests.\n\nKwanzaa has seven main principles: Umoja (unity), Kujichagulia (self-determination), Ujima (collective work and responsibility), Ujamaa (cooperative economics), Nia (purpose), Kuumba (creativity), and Imani (faith).\n\nKwanzaa isn’t a Swahili word. It’s borrowed from the word kwanza, meaning “first,” from the Swahili phrase “matunda ya kwanza,” adding an extra ‘a’ to make the word long enough to accommodate one letter for each of the seven children present at an early celebration.\n\nPancha Ganapati — The Family Festival of Giving\n\nPancha Ganapati is a modern Hindu festival honoring the Five-Faced (pancha means “five”) Maha Ganapati — Lord of Categories. It falls during the 30 days of the ancient Markali Pillaiyar home festival and lasts for five days — from December 21 through 25.\n\nFamilies will decorate a shrine using lights, festoons, and cloth in the color of the day. Before the puja, a tray of sweets, fruits, and incense is prepared and offered to Lord Ganapati, ideally by the children. Chants and songs are sung in His praise. After the worship, sweets are enjoyed while colorfully wrapped gifts are given to the children, who place them before Pancha Ganapati to open on the fifth day.\n\nLord Ganesha came from the forest, so pine boughs, bamboo, palm fronds, or banana leaves are common decorations.\n\nHanukkah – Festival of Lights\n\nThe holiday commemorates the triumph of a band of rebel Jews known as the Maccabees in reclaiming their temple from the Greek-Syrians. The temple required a holy light to burn inside at all times, but the Jews had only enough oil for one night. Incredibly, the light burned for eight days.\n\nLatkes, sufganiyot (jelly doughnuts), apple fritters, and kugel — delicious and savory fried foods are central to the celebration. This isn’t a coincidence; people fry food in oil for Hanukkah to symbolize the miracle oil that burned for eight nights straight.\n\nYou may have seen the holiday spelled like Hanukkah, Hannuka, or Chanukah. The most common version is Hanukkah, but all of the spellings are acceptable because there is no correct way to translate the Hebrew sounds into English.\n\nWinter Solstice — The Shortest Day\n\nWinter Solstice is the shortest day of the year for the Northern Hemisphere. The daytime lasts 7 hours and 49 minutes in London, 9 hours and 15 minutes in New York, and 9 hours and 20 minutes in Beijing.\n\nThe days get colder but not warmer after Winter Solstice. This Winter Solstice fact seems to disobey the laws of nature. Although the sun shines longer and longer in the Northern Hemisphere, it does not get warm gradually.\n\nThe Winter Solstice was first discovered in China 2,500 years ago. In the Spring and Autumn Period (770 – 476 BC), China had applied the ancient instrument called Tugui for measuring the length of the sun’s shadow.\n\nBoxing Day — A Day to Give\n\nBoxing Day is a day when gifts are given to people in the service industry (mail carriers, door attendants, porters, and tradespeople). It’s a holiday in the UK and most places settled by the English, except the United States. The holiday is also a time to give to people who are in need.\n\nIn Ireland, the 26th is generally called St. Stephen’s Day or the Day of the Wren. It used to be considered unlucky to kill a wren bird on any day but Boxing Day. The hunting of wrens was a popular Boxing Day event in England many years ago.\n\nJapanese New Year — Shōgatsu\n\nThe welcoming of the New Year in Japan involves deep cleansing, resolute silence, symbolic food, and the welcoming of the gods. The Japanese believe in the importance of welcoming the new year with a clean slate. For Oosouji, a few days before the year ends, major house cleaning happens in every household.\n\nThe Japanese extremely discourage any form of noise-making on New Year’s Eve. Joya no Kane is the only desirable loud sound on New Year’s Eve — it’s a Buddhist tradition of banging the temple bell 108 times to welcome the new year. This practice originated from the belief that there are 108 types of unnecessary emotions (Bonno) in the world such as anger, grudge, and discord.\n\nLet us know what holidays you celebrate.",

      "# [Career Spotlight: Product Management with Jonathan Marsh by Carlos Casarez on 2022-12-09](https://peak6.com/career-spotlight-product-management-with-jonathan-marsh/)\nWhat does a product manager do? In short, they identify a customer need and the business objectives that a product or feature will meet. They define what success looks like for each product and they rally their team to turn that vision into a reality.\n\nBack in 2020, Jonathan Marsh was hearing rave reviews from friends about PEAK6. One former coworker, Marc Drake, had the challenge of building a PEAK6 product management group from the ground up. “There was a wide portfolio of fun projects. It was very appealing,” says Jonathan.\n\nThe Unconventional Journey to Product Management\n\nJonathan has had an untraditional path in his education and career. He received his degree in finance at the University of Michigan Dearborn (U of M). “My educational path was interesting. I ended up at U of M but didn’t start there. I started school at Grand Valley State University and worked at Verizon in order to get their generous tuition reimbursement. Cell phones were at the boom, and I was making tons of money.” Jonathan was able to use this to continue his education and transfer to U of M, even after an illness that stole vision in his right eye.\n\nAfter college, Jonathan moved into an operations path at Cars.com in Chicago, eventually moving into an Operations Business Analyst role. It’s here where he met Marc Drake, who would become the Director of Product Management at PEAK6. From there, Jonathan transitioned to become a business analyst at an IT company and eventually product management for a dental company.\n\nThere Will Be Failures. Turn Them Into Success.\n\nJonathan took the plunge to PEAK6, working primarily with InsurTech, as a Product Manager. “The most fulfilling part is to empower others to be creative,” explains Jonathan. “I work with the team to really understand what the product problem is and how we can create unique solutions. The beauty is that when you truly understand the problem, you can better understand a solution. Then we can empower the team to create added value with efficient amounts of work.” And it’s that empowerment that really drives Jonathan each day.\n\nJonathan has learned in business that a product manager’s job is frequently to turn what appears to be a failure into a success. “Where will you fail today? Can we minimize failure and build progress out of it? This makes it easier,” says Jonathan. “One of our engineers, Nate Johnson, said to me, ‘It’s not to make things easier; it’s to do hard better.’ This sums up our work perfectly, as temporary setbacks are never considered a defeat.” And that’s what our product managers are charged with: solutions can be complicated; solutions can be hard. The question becomes, what can we do better?\n\nAdvice for Product Managers\n\nJonathan easily reflects on his early working days. What does he wish he had understood earlier? “Speak up. There’s an interesting burden, especially as a person of color, in the tech space: you can’t mess up. You cannot fail because you’ll never succeed. I avoided speaking up.” As Jonathan moved through his career, he wasn’t speaking up enough. He thought he had to have the solution, not just define the problem. “The solution exposes itself if you define the right problem,” Jonathan learned. “It’s an ongoing process. Knowing when to seek help and speak up.”\n\nJonathan realized not everyone thinks in this problem-centric way. To get them there, he helps his team realize they will start off on different levels. “You may have to humble yourself and confess your understanding. Ask more questions about how to move forward. It’s tough with tight deadlines and you have to keep track of roadmaps,” says Jonathan. “The most important part of my role is to give someone enough information so they’re prepared to present an idea and be successful.”\n\nJonathan didn’t get here alone. “I really need to give a shoutout to Marc Drake. He’s been my manager since my Cars.com days and he’s provided so much guidance. Also, to Kari Sunderland and Danny Rosenthal, who have been so impactful in collaborating well together. My acceleration is a result of National Flood Services. We may not have achieved everything, but they set the baseline.”",
      "# [Tom Simpson: A View From the Peak by Carlos Casarez on 2023-02-14](https://peak6.com/tom-simpson-a-view-from-the-peak/)\nShakespeare wrote wisdom that roughly said, “Some are born leaders, some achieve leadership, and some have leadership thrust upon them.” Tom Simpson, the CEO of PEAK6 Capital Management, is a little of all three. When he was just starting on the trading floor, his life plan included being retired by now and living the leisurely life of a ski instructor on the Park City slopes. Simpson sat down with us to talk about leadership, PEAK6 Capital Management, fintech, and where his retirement goal went right when it was supposed to go to retirement.\n\nStarting the Day With Intention and Routine\n\nFor many of us, waking up an hour or so before work is enough. For Simpson, it’s precisely 5:12 a.m. Why so specific? Trial and error. And 5:12 is the perfect time to lie in bed and use his handheld devices to catch up with the stock and business news on his well-curated Twitter feed. “Then I optimize the morning to catch up, grab a quick breakfast bar, and do more news searching,” Simpson says. “By 5:45 a.m., I’m fully awake, doing some stretches, and then meeting with my trainer.” This routine prepares Simpson for his first meeting at 7 a.m. After all, the market opens at 8:30 a.m.\n\nDue to the markets, there’s even more routine in mind for the day. He’s frequently looking at news headlines. Reaching out to his senior risk and portfolio teams for anything else he needs to know. By the time the market opens, Simpson knows where to focus. He can move on to executive meetings and work on strategy when the market slows down.\n\nBut none of Simpson’s day is possible without the support of a team. And it’s the people at PEAK6 Capital Management that have kept him around so long.\n\nIt’s the People Who Fuel the Fire\n\nAny successful leader knows that success isn’t a one-person show. And that’s something Simpson recognized early on working with Matt Hulsizer (Co-Founder & Managing Partner, PEAK6 Investments) 17 years ago. “It was working with Matt in a hedge fund that opened my eyes to the business beyond trading,” explains Simpson. From that leadership example, Simpson opened his own division at PEAK6 Capital Management (Spark), allowing him to lead a team beyond risk. “There was fulfillment there,” says Simpson. “And helping others to find success was so rewarding.”\n\nOne thing employees at PEAK6 Capital Management often hear: it’s always about the people. “I didn’t create that culture, but I empower it so it can continue to flourish,” Simpson says. “When we hire, we can’t have selfish people and we look at our core values of adaptability, collaboration, grit, ownership, and curiosity. An individual’s mindset needs to be, ‘if we do well, then I do well,’ — not the opposite direction.” It’s all about being stronger together at PEAK6 Capital Management, and that “if we do well” vibe makes the people connect in a unique way.\n\nSo when the role of leading the trading team came up, it fueled him to move the business forward. Because it’s been people and opportunities that have made all the difference for Simpson and his career.\n\nThe Opportunity to Give Back\n\nSimpson has achieved a rare level of longevity in the finance and fintech industries. “It can be hard to succeed. I needed the ability to adapt and add value with my skill set,” he says. “My career has been opportunity-based and not goal based. I think that’s fairly unique to PEAK6 — to have so many opportunities — and that’s why I want to give employees the same opportunities I’ve been given.”\n\nWhat he likes to pass on to new traders is to be curious. Simpson will tell young traders, “Ask questions of everyone you can. Build relationships so you can ask those questions.” Simpson knows that as a young trader, you are narrowly focused based on risk feedback to know if you’re right or wrong. And when you only know traders, it’s easy to believe that’s the whole world. “The world is larger than that,” Simpson says. “Business is more gray, and it’s more about the people rather than the numbers. Young traders need to understand that through time and experience you can gain that context and understand the vastness of the world.”\n\nAnd the world is vast, including at PEAK6 Capital Management. There are 226 people and only about 70 traders. “The entire team (risk and research analysts, software engineers, and more) is integral to give the traders the information they need to be successful. We’re a collaborative network of employees that all contribute to the trading landscape. No one is out there alone.” Additionally, Simpson points out that in the finance industry, it’s a marathon not a sprint. Good days or bad days, no single day makes your career, so focus on the long game.\n\nAn Eye on What’s Next\n\nAt PEAK6 Capital Management, it’s a trading business, and it’s pretty niche at its core. But there’s still a grand horizon to meet. Simpson explains, “Of course, we want to grow our market share in the areas where we’re already successful. And then it’s about discovering where we can apply our risk management skills and provide liquidity outside our core U.S. listed equity options.”\n\nWhile this isn’t the mountain he saw himself skiing at this age, it’s a peak Tom Simpson is more than happy to climb."

      "# Post ID 18azgv3: What did I miss out on when my Peak6 offer got rescinded? with +97 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-12-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/18azgv3/what_did_i_miss_out_on_when_my_peak6_offer_got/)\nBack in 2016 I graduated from CMU with a bachelors degree in computational finance. I signed an offer with Peak6 Investments. The base salary was quite low iirc. \n\nI moved to Chicago a week before my start date but didn’t get my visa in time. It came a week after my start date and Peak6 rescinded my offer. \n\nI left the country and then came back two years later and I now work as a software engineer at a FAANG making a good living. I got married and probably would’ve never met my wife had my offer not have been rescinded. \n\nSometimes, I do wonder how my life would’ve turned out if I got into prop trading. Can anyone tell me what I missed out on and what it would’ve been like had I been a trader at Peak6? \n\nAlso what is the total compensation for a trader at Peak6? What does the bonus look like as a mid level trader?\n\n## Comment ID kc1hmkp with +85 score by [(Vegetable-Square-354, Reddit, 2023-12-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/18azgv3/what_did_i_miss_out_on_when_my_peak6_offer_got/kc1hmkp/) (in reply to ID 18azgv3):\nIf I recall correctly, Peak6 has not been performing well as of late.

The messaging in that email is absolutely not normal lmao - the sentiment is, not the actual message. \n\nAnd they made this point on the podcast but if you have people at the org who don't like her and your org has had many failures and issues during her tenure, an email like that that gasses her up to that degree doesn't exactly show how you plan to change things and how the replacement will be different, ya know, the purpose behind changing senior leadership.

The idea that she’s the “CEO” of EG is what was given to her due to the good graces she’s clearly formed with PEAK6 management.

The part I don't get is why Peak6, an investment company, ALSO seems all-in on making it a vanity project for Nicole. RL's article talked about how Jessica Hammond, another executive appointed by P6, was focused entirely on protect Nicole's image, and made that objective a top priority for everyone else too. Now this whole email gassing her up. \n\n\nWhy is Peak6 seemingly more interested in the image of the employee they tasked with overseeing their multi-million dollar investment than they are with the investment itself?

I think he stated he just couldn't afford to compete with the venture capital investments into eSports and got out.\n\nEdit: dug up where I remembered how I got this impression. This interview with Hotbid at TI4 really showed how he cared about the org IMO, and how he emphasised the players first https://youtu.be/pNmyT-LykpE?si=vgoJ2zNr260n_0Zy\n\n#### Comment ID ka7fyac with +5 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-11-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/180kz5v/evil_genius_are_leaving_esports/ka7fyac/) (in reply to ID ka7699n):\nIf R6 was a bigger esport how they left that scene probably gets way more attention.\n\n#### Comment ID l00jig0 with +1 score by [(AdderTude, Reddit, 2024-04-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/180kz5v/evil_genius_are_leaving_esports/l00jig0/) (in reply to ID ka7699n):\nEG quit R6 because Ubisoft screwed them over.

It didn’t start out that way and wasn’t intentional. It evolved into a stats game as each year, more and more people (including qualified people) apply to these companies. If everyone could do questions 1-4, then what criteria is used? Let’s add another one, Who can do a fifth? Too many people able to do five and we need to hire N people? Keep making questions 4 and 5 harder until it’s N candidates on average that can complete it. Still not enough? Okay, let’s add culture fit tie breakers, which realistically just means you have to get lucky 4 times in a row and not get the asshat architect who needs perfectly optimized 2 line recursive DP Manacher’s algorithm that compiles first time within 5 minutes.\n\nThe questions themselves aren’t hit or miss. They are actually pretty well designed and solvable by most people grinding Leetcode daily. It’s the chance of getting across the whole race that’s hit or miss. I think one article or ted talk claimed a committee of four Google hiring managers were given four hiring packets (which includes the Resume, the tech interview feedback, and the personal comments), then rejected them all. Once they revealed the names, they realized they had rejected each other’s old hiring packets from 5 or 6 years ago. Many people working at these companies believe they would not get hired again if interviewed again. People definitely got grandfathered into the industry.\n\n#### Comment ID gdga0mb with +2 score by [(bbbbjkugcbjj, Reddit, 2020-11-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/jzv4l5/most_difficult_oas_youve_ever_done/gdga0mb/) (in reply to ID gdebks4):\nDid you pass all test cases for citadel for the interview?\n\n### Comment ID gdf27pk with +8 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-11-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/jzv4l5/most_difficult_oas_youve_ever_done/gdf27pk/) (in reply to ID gde7d22):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID gdeyedb with +1 score by [(Calvimn, Reddit, 2020-11-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/jzv4l5/most_difficult_oas_youve_ever_done/gdeyedb/) (in reply to ID gde7d22):\nThat’s TC tho\n\n## Comment ID gdeew15 with +88 score by [(Organic-Pipe-8139, Reddit, 2020-11-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/jzv4l5/most_difficult_oas_youve_ever_done/gdeew15/) (in reply to ID jzv4l5):\nRoblox\n\n### Comment ID gdeuj9b with +72 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-11-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/jzv4l5/most_difficult_oas_youve_ever_done/gdeuj9b/) (in reply to ID gdeew15):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID gdewhyr with +67 score by [(degenerateCSstudent, Reddit, 2020-11-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/jzv4l5/most_difficult_oas_youve_ever_done/gdewhyr/) (in reply to ID gdeuj9b):\nIf only the parents knew what DP was.

Accepting a deal so shitty makes me give credence to his claims they took advantage of him being young and naive. \n\nFinally, they offered to pay out his stock in installments after he retires, but he is only 24 lmao. I'm not sure the structure of that deal but it sounds like he gets 300k now and the installments after retirement. Which would be years down the road and the value of the stock should have increased significantly, but he wouldn't receive those gains because he had already sold it.\n\nBig yikes all around.

Sumail reduced it as much as they did.\n\nThey proposed this, and Sumail agreed to it.  The lawsuit tries to make it sound like he's a child who had no idea what was going on, no bargaining power at all, and no control over the situation.  That just... isn't true at all.\n\nHe was a multi-millionaire with an ownership stake in the organization.  He had abundant bargaining power, and the resources to make sure the negotiations were handled by professionals.  Instead it looks like he just signed the first offer they made him.  \n\nOf course they took advantage of him being immature, they sound like scumbags.  But a lot of the comments in here are acting like he had no agency at all.  \"Painfully irresponsible\" describes him as well as \"young and naive\" does here.

All of the stuff that was done to him here was done with his explicit approval. \n\nI had the same reaction to “ambiguous terms and arcane agreements” that the court is going to have: he was making a healthy six figures just in salary, while negotiating a crucial contract with long ranging life implications; why the fuck didn’t he seek competent counsel? The agreement was only as arcane and ambiguous as Sumail allowed it to be. \n\n  It’s one thing if a party lacks the resources to properly advise them during negotiations of this sort, but that is emphatically not the case here.  Sumail walked into this admittedly awful agreement with all the advantages necessary to properly understand it and challenge it before signing, and he chose not to.  \n\nThese terms are horrendous for him, but the courts do generally find that it is legal to make poor choices.  Especially when you are privileged enough to have all the resources available to make correct choices should you choose to do so.  \n\nHe screwed himself over here, too.  He may be young, but he’s an adult and he’s certainly old enough to understand that you have a lawyer review important deals and guide you during negotiations.   They negotiated hard, but it also sounds like he signed the first garbage offer they made him.  \n\nYou might not understand why they treated Sumail like this, but I don’t understand how Sumail and his support network fucked up this badly.  He had agency here, no matter what the suit is trying to imply, and he made astonishingly poor choices.\n\n#### Comment ID jbpkbfo with +57 score by [(etalommi, Reddit, 2023-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11ns7ar/sumail_sues_evil_geniuses_for_breach_of_contract/jbpkbfo/) (in reply to ID jbp81i8):\nAre you really shocked that a young man who grew up in another country and hit stardom playing video games in his teens was manipulated into signing something he shouldn't?\n\nIt doesn't matter that he had the resources to hire good representation, he didn't have the perspective to do so. He was exploited, even if he could have known better.\n\nThe courts also have the power to determine if contractual provisions are enforceable and/or were met.

He was not some poor kid without a lawyer being pressured into signing something he didn’t understand in order to make rent.  \n\nThey may be incompetent, but honestly it kinda sounds like they made a terrible opening offer and then Sumail just fucking signed it without even really understanding it.  \n\nTotal incompetence is coming from both sides here.  Sumail’ support network failed him miserably here, and Sumail himself made some very stupid choices. \n\n The lawsuit attempts to make it sound like this agreement was forced on a poor young child without any agency.   That’s just categorically not true.  Sumail had more than enough resources to handle this responsibly and avoid this whole mess to begin with.  I have a hard time accepting that he was tricked by arcane agreements when he had the option to have his own lawyers deal with this.  \n\nAnd morally, that may or may not matter to you.

Where was Sumail's representation when EG was acquired and he had common stock? Why did he not choose to be paid out for the value of his stocks? Why did he choose to convert his common stocks into stocks in Peak6? It would require Peak6 to buy him out (which they proposed to in his unit purchase agreement) or for Peak6 to be acquired. They would need his signature for this. \n\nI will caveat that when employees are given stocks, they're often common stock or phantom stocks that convert to common stock in an event. When companies are acquired, their debts are paid first, and then preferred stock owners (usually the owners and investors of EG), and the remaining amount go to common stock owners.\n\n2. When they proposed to amend his contract to $2k/mo, was that something they could do per his original contract? If so, not much you can do there. If not, why did he sign it versus wait out the remainder of his contract? Or was he upset about losing a year of pro Dota 2 and demanding an exit in order to go play on another team?\n\n3. Under the proposed unit purchase agreement, he doesn't have to sell shit. He could be an investor in Peak6 still with all his stocks if he wanted to. Again, it would require them buying him out on his shares or for Peak6 to be acquired, or unlikely scenario that the terms allowed for him to find a private buyer for his shares.\n\nIt just seems like he didn't have adequate representation when he needed it most. And if he happened to be underage, it's likely his parents were in charge. I have a gut feeling he will lose this case.\n\n## Comment ID jboqdid with +30 score by [(NicksNewNose, Reddit, 2023-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11ns7ar/sumail_sues_evil_geniuses_for_breach_of_contract/jboqdid/) (in reply to ID 11ns7ar):\nPeak6 is a shitty company.

Hassan had lodged the complaint arguing that his former organisation had breached their contract when converting stock he held within the company from preferred units to common stock, supposedly without him understanding the gravity of that change. After days of presenting evidence and arguments the jury decided that neither Evil Geniuses – here in the suit under their companies EG LLC, EG Inc and EG Holdings – nor Peak6 had a case to answer.\n\n[...]\n\n>With no ground conceded by either party the matter proceeded to a jury trial where the jurors were given lengthy instructions regarding how to assess each of the claims made against the defendants. Beginning on the 13th February the verdict was officially filed on the 1st March where the claims of breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, false misrepresentation, false promis, breach of fiduciary duty, conversion and unclean hands were all found in favour of Evil Geniuses and Peak6.

It is usually very hard to contest a signed contract. It seems that their whole case revolved around their fraud claim, which would allow him to circumvent a bunch of contract law restrictions regarding evidence.  \nMost of that is really hard to show because it requires showing intent. Showing intent that a big organization wanted to deceive or make him enter into a contract it never had the expectation to perform is really hard.

But when you are a near bankrupt group of video gamers and someone throws in money to restart EG, they are the party calling the shots.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's just how it goes in all start-ups really.\n\n#### Comment ID kugii21 with +4 score by [(Mindless-Attorney537, Reddit, 2024-03-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1bc5mg7/sumail_has_reportedly_lost_his_lawsuit_against/kugii21/) (in reply to ID kugd34q):\nYeah, start-ups world is totally different. I wonder if it had an anti-dilution clause, something about hostile takeover, or change of control. I am also unsure if his shares were due to employment, and if it would have changed anything. If any of the minority shareholders or the board did something questioning all the change. If it would characterize any breach of duty.  \n\n\nI am a new attorney, I haven't had much exposure to start-ups and shares.

They're not allowed to misrepresent the law to the jury to suit their client's interests, for example.\n\nWhen rendering a verdict, the jury is basically handed a list of *factual* questions, which they have to answer yes/no.

IT teams are very disorganized and poorly funded and supported. Finance teams lack real strong talent and do whatever they want contrary to accounting principles. HR only protects the owners and is very much in bed with bad managers. Workday rollout was chaotic because no one knew what they were doing and didn’t work well together. There’s a culture of form over substance, where form is overwhelmingly rewarded at the expense of good performers. Fun and challenging work is hoarded for favorites who make mistakes and are excused, but non-favorites somehow get blamed for company performance. The owners either don’t have a clue how toxic their own firm is or don’t care, either way they subscribe to outdated methods of work from the 1980s/90s and want people to sit straight at their desks w/o getting up 4-5 days a week in an office they purposely make cold to “make you work harder”. Compensation is also disproportionate depending who you ask, and headcount is kept far too secret for that purpose in the name of “confidentiality and protecting employees”.",

It is a company of companies, all of which have been in growth stage, all of which have experienced expected growing pains. With that growth comes tons of opportunity for those that desire it. It is a 25 year old company with a start up mentality, decisions made quickly and you must be able to be agile and pivot. It is a place that you can have ten different careers and never have to leave. It is not for everyone and that is said from the start. Its for those that have an entrepreneur spirit, a passion for working hard and adding value, have a sense of humor, love to learn and grow, thrive in being challenged - personally and professionally, geek out on solving problems, and okay with having very active and passionate founders. The people are amazing and endless opportunity to try new things.",

Cares more about promoting an image then actually executing to attain that image 4. Backwards and behind the times 5. The aspirational stories by the founders seem to evolve on a yearly basis. Would not be surprised, if we hear, they invested in Apple's Series A. This stuff gets old after a while and the self promoting is a big sign on insecurity",

I have a ton of respect for the leadership here (see Pros section), but they're pulled daily in a lot of different directions, so you need to be independent and figure out how to use your time with them wisely if you want to maximize your effectiveness.",

The leaders of the PEAK6 Services team are long-time employees, and it's very easy to see why they've earned those roles. I've worked at some companies where you wonder what Senior Leadership is doing day-to-day, and that is never a question I've had for a second at PEAK6. Compensation is roughly competitive and the health benefits are much better than I've seen in past roles. The Chicago office is very nice and has great amenities as well, and it's a fun environment to be in.",

IT teams are very disorganized and poorly funded and supported. Finance teams lack real strong talent and do whatever they want contrary to accounting principles. HR only protects the owners and is very much in bed with bad managers. Workday rollout was chaotic because no one knew what they were doing and didn’t work well together. There’s a culture of form over substance, where form is overwhelmingly rewarded at the expense of good performers. Fun and challenging work is hoarded for favorites who make mistakes and are excused, but non-favorites somehow get blamed for company performance. The owners either don’t have a clue how toxic their own firm is or don’t care, either way they subscribe to outdated methods of work from the 1980s/90s and want people to sit straight at their desks w/o getting up 4-5 days a week in an office they purposely make cold to “make you work harder”. Compensation is also disproportionate depending who you ask, and headcount is kept far too secret for that purpose in the name of “confidentiality and protecting employees”.",

      "# [SBJ Tech Week: PEAK6's Matt Hulsizer dives into the impact technology will have on officiating by Mike Alongi on 2024-03-07](https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2024/03/07/sbj-tech-week-matt-hulsizer-1-on-1)\nTechnology has already had a massive impact on the world of sports officiating -- from VAR in soccer to proposed optimal tracking for line-to-gain rulings in the NFL to potential robot umpires in MLB -- and PEAK6 Investments co-founder Matt Hulsizer said Wednesday at SBJ Tech Week in N.Y. that the technology is only going to become more entrenched in the coming years. Hulsizer was asked about two leagues that he is very familiar with: the NHL -- where he owns a minority stake in the Wild -- and the Premier League -- where he owns stakes in multiple clubs. On the NHL, Hulsizer noted the league \"is making progress,\" but \"I wish it was a little bit faster.\" Hulsizer: \"There's some decisions where ... I know the exact play that happened six weeks earlier and maybe it was a year earlier and it was a totally different call, which I think the league understands and is trying to make progress.\" He added that \"some of the data collection has been better\" in the league recently as well. But for soccer, Hulsizer -- who acknowledged he'd probably be fined for his comments -- said officiating in the EPL \"is problematic.\" Hulsizer: \"Sports were fine for 150 years before we had technology. ... So now we've added this VAR, Video Assisted Referee, which again, I wouldn't mind, what I mind is when we get it wrong. ... If you review it, at least get it right. ... I could live with human error, I can't live with human error when the technology is wrong.\"\n\nOther topics touched on during Hulsizer's 1-on-1:\n\nOn his wins and losses from investing in sports tech: \"One we invested in that didn't work so well was ... a company that was using a lot of data and tech to measure and predict winners in MotoGP and Formula 1. And the idea was to take the data and sell it to the teams ... and the only buyer that showed up of course was a gambling house. And then the gambling house that was using it got themselves in trouble, so now the exclusive deal failed. So the business, it was not a lack of skill, it was really an execution issue. ... I tell you one that we're proud of, a company called SportsDigita. They are effectively the sales force for sports teams. ... And it's not like they do any one thing particularly well, they just do all the things well. And so you end up just going there for ease of use.\"\n\nOn AI and its applications for PEAK6: \"The things that artificial intelligence is going to be really good at are measurable things. ... That computational skill, computers do better, but the relational skill is not quite as good and it's going to be a little bit longer. So I think AI is going to do particularly well in discrete sports initially and later as they learn they will get better at some of the more relational sports like soccer, football.\"\n\nOn investing in European soccer clubs, including in the Premier League: \"Being able to afford to invest in a Premier League club, I didn't grow up thinking that that was something I was going to do. I'm very grateful that we're in the position to do that. It's interesting, it has a lot of optionality because of the relegation and promotion factor, and so it's a fun puzzle that could potentially be rewarding.\"\n\nOn how to parse through \"meaningless\" sports data: \"Most of the data that we record in sports tends to be meaningless data. And we have learned this lesson, and this is where sports can follow the financial industry. The financial industry tried to do this years ago, we did it. We analyzed every single piece of data that we could find, we created this gigantic matrix, and you know what we found is the single best predictor of market direction or movement? Denver Broncos home wins. ... What we have learned is that you have to start with a hypothesis and then the data is conformational. If you go the reverse way, it's deadly.\"",
      "# [PEAK6 Investments LLC](https://www.marketswiki.com/wiki/PEAK6_Investments_LLC)\nPEAK6 Investments is a financial services firm located in Chicago that includes market making, risk management, a hedge fund and proprietary trading operations.[1][2] Peak6's core brands include: PEAK6 Capital Management, Apex Clearing, National Flood Services and Evil Geniuses, an esports business.\n\nThe company's first tech-based solution was developed in 1997 to optimize options trading and, over the past two decades, the same formula has been used across a range of industries, asset classes and business stages.\n\nIts subsidiary PEAK6 Capital Management is a major options market maker and proprietary trading firm, which the firm says is one of the largest options trading operations in the U.S.[3] PEAK6 also launched options news and information service The Options News Network, or ONN.tv in September 2008.[4]\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nPEAK6 was founded over 25 years ago by co-founders Jenny Just and Matt Hulsizer. Their journey started as options traders at O'Connor and Associates in Chicago, where they gained experience and a knack for taking calculated risks. When O'Connor and Associates relocated to the East Coast, Just and Hulsizer chose to remain in Chicago.\n\nPEAK6 began as a proprietary equity options trading firm. It leveraged its trading profits to fund various ventures, embracing opportunities with a focus on learning from each experience, regardless of success. As markets evolved, PEAK6 launched OptionsHouse, a hedge fund and retail broker-dealer, setting the stage for a pivotal moment.\n\nWhen the custodian and clearing firm for OptionsHouse, Penson Financial Services, faced bankruptcy, PEAK6 stepped in, acquiring what would become Apex Fintech Solutions.[5] This move not only saved OptionsHouse but also positioned PEAK6 as a technology-forward disruptor in the industry. Brokerage firms seeking modern technology solutions soon partnered with PEAK6.\n\nIts OptionsHouse, LLC subsidiary was rated among the best brokers for options traders by Barron's in March of 2009.[6] However, OptionsHouse was acquired by E*Trade on September 12, 2016 for $725 million.[7]\n\nOver the years, PEAK6 diversified its portfolio with ventures and acquisitions spanning cryptocurrency, esports, finance education, and more. The firm also has a simulated trading facility called WeSeed LLC (or www.WeSeed.com), which provides beginner traders with a platform to learn how to trade stocks.\n\nPEAK6 also has interests in financial technology firms Stockgroup and ELX Electronic Liquidity Exchange and invests in and runs hedge funds.[8] Its subsidiary PEAK6 Capital Management is an options market maker and proprietary trading firm.\n\nIn September 2014 the company said it would spin out its $2.3 billion hedge-fund business, Peak6 Advisors, which would change its name to Achievement Asset Management and focus on growth by trading European credit and stocks out of a new London office. The renamed business will continue to be led by CEO Joseph Scoby, who will buy out the roughly 50% stake in the hedge-fund business that Peak6 Investments owns.[9]\n\nIn September 2020 BBC News reported PEAKS6 was looking to add an office in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The company said it planned to create 160 new jobs in Northern Ireland over four years, with the help of more than £1m of support from Invest Northern Ireland. [10] [11]\n\nIn 2007, PEAK6 Investments was listed as one of \"Chicago's 101 Best And Brightest Companies To Work For.\"[12]\n\nProducts and Services[edit]\n\nSubsidiaries:\n\nPEAK6 Capital Management LLC\n\nPEAK6 Strategic Capital LLC\n\nApex Clearing Corporation\n\nNational Flood Services LLC\n\nEvil Geniuses LLC\n\nKey People[edit]\n\nMatthew Hulsizer, Co-founder and Managing Partner\n\nJenny Just, Co-founder and Managing Partner\n\nJudi Hart, Chief Operating Officer\n\nJay Coppoletta, Chief Corporate Development & Legal Officer\n\nWilliam Capuzzi, Chief Executive Officer at Apex Clearing and Partner at PEAK6",

StashWorks simplifies saving for millions of employees, eliminating stress and encouraging financial and professional success.\n\nThe first cohort of StashWorks partners include Wonder, a company founded by entrepreneur Marc Lore that is redefining at-home dining and food delivery; Aurify Brands, one of New York City's largest independent restaurant operators; PEAK6 Investments; and other notable private and public brands in retail, customer service, and insurance. Backed by SHRM—the world's largest HR association—StashWorks works directly with employers and can be accessed through best-in-class PEOs as well as top-tier benefit brokers.\n\n\"It's standard practice for employers to offer either a 401(k) or a pension for retirement, but hardworking Americans need just as much help saving for now,\" said Liza Landsman, Stash CEO. \"StashWorks supports employees' financial needs in both the short and long term, with the broader impact of helping companies elevate the employee experience—leading to happier, healthier, and more productive workplaces.\"\n\n\"Stash is an innovative leader in the personal finance and fintech space, and we're thrilled to be both a strategic investor in Stash and a key launch partner of StashWorks, its new disruptive offering for companies and their employees,\" said Johnny C. Taylor, Jr., SHRM-SCP and SHRM President and CEO. \"SHRM is the trusted authority on all things work, and we know that employers want to give their workers the tools to be financially successful, but this can be a challenge to manage. StashWorks makes it easy for everyone.\"\n\nFor millions of Americans today, saving money is hard and out of reach even with a regular source of income. Meanwhile, research also proves that inflation and the inability to grow wealth continue to take a toll on the workplace experience. StashWorks makes saving a habit that sticks: Employees can designate any dollar amount or paycheck percentage to save on pay day, quickly earning rewards for 'Saving Streaks' as they hit key milestones on their journey to financial wellbeing.\n\n\"Offering employees a financial tool for saving money not only promotes fairness within our organization but also contributes to a more inclusive and equitable workplace culture where everyone has the opportunity to thrive financially,\" said Marc Lore, Chairman and CEO of Wonder. \"StashWorks will be the first solution that gives our employees easy-to-use tools to save so they can easily achieve both short- and long-term goals in a cost-effective way, with educational and structural frameworks that provide a holistic approach to their personal finances.\"\n\nAbout StashWorks:\n\nStashWorks brings the innovation and accessibility of modern financial technology to employee benefits. StashWorks helps customers set and pursue financial goals of every size, one paycheck contribution at a time, by creating a seamless all-in-one experience for employees to manage their paycheck and saving goals all in one place.1 StashWorks incentivizes good money behaviors with cash bonuses into a customer's managed investment account as they hit specific milestones—a larger bonus for getting started, and, during their first six months using the platform, an opportunity to receive additional 'Saving Streak Rewards' for each month in which the customer makes two paycheck deposits. The benefit also comes with Stash's patented Stock-Back® Debit Mastercard®, which lets customers earn up to 3% in stock as they spend with the card2, plus no overdraft fees3, ATM access, pay day up to two days early4, and access to curated guidance and advice through the Stash Learn platform. With StashWorks, millions more can use Stash to easily build healthy habits and learn as they earn.\n\nAbout Stash:\n\nStash is an investing app dedicated to empowering people to invest and build better lives. Stash's plans—starting at just $3 a month—unlock access to a suite of simple, automated solutions designed to help people find security and peace of mind through investing. In 2023, the company announced the appointment of Liza Landsman as CEO, a $40M fundraise, and its Smart Portfolio managed account was named as the top-performing overall robo-advisor by Condor Capital.5 Stashers are 15% more financially literate than the average American6, and rely on Stash for timely education, expert advice, and clear next steps to help them grow their money and achieve lifelong goals.\n\nFor more information about Stash, please visit www.stash.com.\n\nStashWorks Saving Streak Rewards are subject to terms & conditions.

      "# [Thirty Minute Mentors Podcast Transcript: PEAK6 Co by Adam Mendler on 2024-02-13](https://www.adammendler.com/blog/jenny-just)\nI recently interviewed PEAK6 Co-Founder Jenny Just on my podcast, Thirty Minute Mentors. Here is a transcript of our interview:\n\nAdam: Our guest today is a member of a highly select group of women who are self-made billionaires. Jenny Just is the co-founder and managing director of PEAK6, a multibillion-dollar financial services and technology company. Jenny, thank you for joining us.\n\nJenny: Thank you. I'm so excited to be here.\n\nAdam: Excited to have you on. You grew up in Wisconsin and did your undergrad at the University of Michigan before moving to Chicago to take an entry-level job at a financial services firm. Can you take listeners back to your early days, what early experiences and lessons shaped your worldview and shaped the trajectory of your success?\n\nJenny: Sure, I'd be happy to do that. I started my career out of undergrad on the Chicago Board Options Exchange trading floor with a company called O'Connor and Associates who are infamous in the options world. And I have to say, I had no idea what I was going to do. I had no idea what options trading was. And I ended up taking that job because it was very early days and dressing casual kind of world. They also served food. Google didn't exist back then. So Haagen Dazs and beer in the fridge was really enticing to my 21-year-old self. And my very first day on the exchange Drexel Burnham declared bankruptcy and the market went bananas. So, I was taken down there and I did not know what I was gonna experience. And for those of you who haven't seen Trading Places are one of the infamous Wall Street movies. It's like game day every day, screaming and yelling, lots of large men, and very few people who look like myself down there. So, it's highly entertaining. But also, it's like a foreign world. And I was super lucky to learn it. That's what I have to say. It's a language not a lot of people learn. Even in the financial industry, going all the way to the far right of that curve is our learning options. And they're like puzzle pieces. So they not only help you think about the financial products, so I happen to do options on stocks. But they help you to think about all the different places of a business, which I didn't know at the time, I was just learning options trading. But eventually, when I left O'Connor, they had done a deal with Swiss Bank and eventually became UBS. And we were going off on our own. But how you put pieces of your risk profile together is something we learned quite literally on the trading floor, but then used quite figuratively in other ways when we started to build a business. So I'm very fortunate to have learned what I learned. The other big thing you learn when you learn trading is you learn how to make quick decisions. And clearly, you don't have all the information and the opportunity to do that over and over and fail the majority of the time. So when you look at the portfolio of options that we have, it's an original business we started 26 years ago, called PEAK6 Capital Management, and it's never had a losing year to this day. And that's the thing that's funded all the other businesses we've done, but we lose 46% of our trades. So some high number, hopefully not over 50%. But you get really used to taking risks. And I think it was super opportunistic that I was able to do that at such a young age.\n\nAdam: Can you dive a little bit deeper into your approach to decision-making and your approach to taking and managing risk?\n\nJenny: Sure. I generally thought I was a pretty good decision-maker. Not until you're forced to make them by yourself, one on one with the market do you realize you're not as good as you think. And it's one of the reasons why for people who are not interested necessarily, first of all, they're not in the industry, so they're not trading. But you have to manage your money. And many people will say, \"I'll use an advisor.\" But even if you use an advisor, trading stocks for yourself, you learn so much. You don't have to trade very much, we have fractional shares today. One of our businesses was the first one to bring that to market, Apex FinTech Solutions. But you've learned so much by doing that transaction. And so the interesting thing many years later, though, what I would say about me learning, and thinking I was a good decision maker, and then of course, practicing it over and over again. In the trading world, there are a lot of people in our world that play poker. And I never did. I was the opposite of that. And it turns out that poker is an incredible way to think about making decisions with incomplete information. And so I learned later in life, and I say to this day, if I had learned poker much earlier, I would have taken 10 years out of my failures, because it gives such a framework for thinking about how to make a decision, because there are so many things that are happening at a poker table. And some people have more or less chips than you, there are more or less powerful positions than you. You have two cards that you're dealt but ends up not being about the cards. It's how you play against the people you're sitting with. So my partners and I today, now that I've learned this game of poker, and I don't have to play for money to get all the skills, let's be clear, is we use poker as a framework very simply. What cards do you think they have? Are we in a deal or a negotiation? What cards do I think they have? And we're going to think different things. But now the question is why? What are you seeing that I'm not seeing? And what can I learn from what you're seeing? And then we can go through the whole play. What do you think has come out on the table already? Five cards come out and poker in a community game. And where do you think we are, and how much is in the pot, and how much they bet? You can use poker as a framework for decision-making. And if you've never done it before, and you're a poker player and trying to do it, your colleagues who haven't played, it's an amazing mentor-mentee opportunity to get inside their head on how they're approaching a decision. So that's been for sure, the most recent, what's called the last four years, way, I've been trying to approach creating a systematic way to make decisions. A decision is a risk by definition. It could be a small risk, or it can be a large risk, but it is a risk. And if you're not comfortable doing that, the most important thing you can do is practice doing it more, don't avoid it. Because those decisions start to compound on each other. You start to learn so much from each decision that you make, and each fail, of course, or success that you have along the way. So we created Poker Power Play, which is a poker app. In my opinion, the only gender-neutral poker app that's out there. And each hand is an opportunity to make a decision. But each game, of course, is an opportunity to think about decisions in a larger way, strategy versus tactics. And we've had a lot of fun, trying to take something that feels subjective and make it more objective.\n\nAdam: Get comfortable being uncomfortable. How did PEAK6 come together? And how were you able to turn it into a multibillion-dollar business?\n\nJenny: That's exactly right. It's not an option, whether something's going to be uncomfortable in the future. You know it's going to be, you may as well prep yourself and give yourself the best opportunity. I always talk about a journey. What relationship, whether it's your relationship with your work with a spouse or a partner, or your relationship with money, none of them are smooth? None of them. There are always going to be ups and downs. Now, what are you going to do as a result of when those ups and downs come? Well, if I can be a better decision-maker, it's one of the reasons why it's incredibly important for women to start to play poker. It's why we're on a mission to teach a million women a game. Because poker is a male-dominated game. 93% or more than 100 million people in the world have played poker, we think the number is much bigger. Nobody knows a number, or men, they get this practice of making those small decisions at a young age, often, often often. And it's not part of our play, or our habits or things that those who identify as women typically are doing. So if you're a dad, and you have a daughter, your daughter should be playing as well as your son should be playing. Because the more I get to practice doing it, there's something I talk about the compound experience. So like compound interest, we know there's an exponential curve. If I reinvest my interest, once I get my principal, I get my interest. Then my interest gets interest and interest. Same thing with those early experiences. The more I get a chance to make those decisions, the more they capitalize on themselves. I learned more earlier. So I have greater learnings to apply later. They compound on themselves. It's part of certainly why I have been able to accomplish what I have been able to accomplish. Because I took a lot of risk early on. I didn't know I was doing it. I always laugh and I say, I didn't know I could say no. So I kept saying yes. I wasn't brilliant at it. I just got a lot of practice.\n\nAdam: How did PEAK6 come together? And how were you able to turn it into a multibillion-dollar business?\n\nJenny: PEAK6 came together, not because we were necessarily in 26 years ago, the entrepreneurship that we talked about today, and all the angel and VC stuff that happens today. And so many people are involved. It certainly wasn't in my vernacular, it wasn't in my world, and the internet's just basically getting running. And our company O'Connor, then Swiss bank, UBS was moving. We were fortunate enough to help start a department, my co-founder, myself, we're fortunate enough to start a department at the bank, in the over-the-counter equity derivative world. So this is not an exchange-traded product. So I had this experience young. It was just me and him. And there was a gentleman who was brought in from Goldman, because O'Connor, at the time didn't do that business. It was the banks who did that business. We brought in a gentleman and it was just us in a room trying to figure out how to sell derivatives to companies, to institutions. And so we had that experience under a belt. And when the bank decided to move and located out in Stanford, we said, well, for personal reasons, we're staying behind. And we said, well, we'll just do that again. I mean, we're naive, honestly. And the interesting thing is our original plan, we've never done. So that was what we call Plan A, we are going to redo that, go out to the Corpus. Because it's just a couple of us in a room doing it the last time. Why can't we just do that again? Well, you need a credit rating to do that. And, with two people in a room and $1.6 million, that's not getting you anywhere. So we tried to partner with banks to do what we were doing. And we got to the 11th hour interestingly, with Jamie Dimon who was at First Chicago, and this is about a year and a change into having started the firm. And we just couldn't get a deal done. Kept delaying, delaying, delaying. Not Jamie's issue, I'm sure, but generally the bank to get things done. And we looked at each other, we said, this may never happen. And now what? The fact that we looked at ourselves in the mirror and said, let's be real. We're not making money. I was a single mom at the time. And I was like, we had worked six, seven years at our previous firm and made okay money for our age, but we got to make some money. So we looked at each other. And fortuitously, we had met a gentleman. And so we started doing some work. We said we needed to start trading, which we had already started. But we need to ramp into this trading. And we met someone who said, \"You can use technology.\" And we said, \"No, we don't know about technology.\" My co-founder was an English major, I was a business major at Michigan. So we started, I put our first server together, and we got our hands dirty. And we started to imagine a world where you had to be on the exchange floor, we were the first off-floor equity trading firms ever as far as we know. And we started the experiment. So we had interns and we said, \"Well, we're going to have some of you go to the trading floor and some of you will not go to the trading floor. And let's see what happens. Because we thought the trading floor was the place to be. So we're open-minded to something that didn't exist and doing it differently, mostly because we knew we couldn't populate the exchange floors. Like we're just a couple of kids in a room. Like what do we know about managing people who are sitting in California or New York? So if we don't want to do that, what is another option? What people should take from that is, what do you want to do? And I knew I didn't want to manage a lot of people. Ironically, today, having a couple of 1000 people and having gone up and down as buying and selling firms, my goal was not to have more than 10 people work for us because I didn't think we knew better. So we did what we needed to do for us to be our best selves. And that started the journey. Things changed the technology, and the idea worked. And that's the business that now has been able to fund us for all our different opportunities over the years.\n\nAdam: It's a great lesson and there are a lot of great lessons in there. Failure can breed success. Your initial business model didn't work. You found a better business model. You found a business model that took you to where you are today. How did that happen? You were open-minded. You were flexible. You are adaptable, you are willing to get your hands dirty, you aren't afraid to try new things, and you aren't afraid to experiment. That's how you did it.\n\nJenny: Yeah. And it's funny over the years because we had the freedom to take risks, and people don't think they own the freedom when they work for somebody else. But you own your freedom to take risks. And the firm I worked at was like that O'Connor was like that. I'm forever grateful to the O'Connor partners. Because I had that freedom all along. It's just whether I use it or not. And in the case where things are up against the wall, and I'm looking, the other thing, of course, they taught us is the highs and lows, what we call the fat tails, and things can get bad. So being realistic, but knowing that I have the power to do something about it, you have more power than you think.\n\nAdam: That's a great lesson, you have the freedom to take risks. At the end of the day, we control our destinies to a degree much greater than any of us realize. All too often, we get trapped in the moment. And we get trapped in the pressures and responsibilities of our day-to-day lives or day-to-day jobs or day-to-day responsibilities. But if you take a step back, your point is right on the money. It's your life, get in the driver's seat, you only have one life, it's yours. Take control. That That's right. How do you assess the companies that you invest in? And what are your best tips on the topic of investing?\n\nJenny: What's particularly interesting having done it over a long period and having a lot of fails, and then having a handful of really big successes and looking back and saying what do I regret or what am I proud of, people probably looked at me, they'd say I'd taken a lot of risk. And I probably would say I didn't take enough risk. And also the one other unique piece to who we are as a firm is that we're trading, we're in the market all the time. Most people are in their businesses unless there are financial businesses, a lot of them are in their retail market, whatever it is. But when you pay attention to the market which has been this glorious market for so many years until April 22, you have to know what the market and therefore ultimately the customer cares about. Where's the real demand today and into the next 5 to 10 years? You're thinking that AI would be the obvious one at the top of the list. If that's the case, then you're also looking at what are investors rewarding. Are they rewarding how many eyeballs you can get? Are they rewarding the bottom line? Those things make a difference in how you approach your business plan. Despite us being in the markets, we were naive in many ways, which is why I would say today, I probably would have taken a risk differently if I could go back and do it again. Where's the most bang for your buck? Whereas for all my time and effort, where is the upside? And being cognizant because there are two things I think that you toil with, especially as an entrepreneur, but what do you care passionately about? If you care about both those things together, or if you don't? Because if you do, you have to think about what the market is rewarding in that scope of time. We might talk about three to five years in from a trading world perspective, but it's more of a decade. What are we looking at in a 7 to 10-year timeframe? Where do we think the customer is gonna be? What are they going to care about? Where are investors looking to invest? And staying attuned to that really will help you make top-down decisions a little bit better. This is why I'd say, the world in the last decade was rewarding every effort under the sun, eyeballs, and making no money, whatever it was, and you can behave differently during those times. And I think coming from the trading world and risk-taking world, we always said we didn't make the most money. We've had a lot of success, but we don't lose money either. It actually could have been an opportunity to lose money which is a funny thing to say, at least to us and historically. But if you think about how many years Amazon did go and not make money, you take some of these bigger lessons that are out there and look at the totality of the market that you're going into. Now, if you're looking at a smaller business and it's a local business, you might wait that less. But if you're trying to build a substantial business, I think it's really important to understand what investors care about. Frankly, PEAK6 has always done this, we're looking for businesses that make money. And we will make bets because if they're strategic to us in some way, or we think we have a unique opportunity, and most of the things we invest, probably half in FinTech, which we have because of APEX FinTech solutions, it's the back end technology for almost 65% of the retail broker-dealers out there. So, we have a lot of knowledge. And so when you have knowledge about the industry, and you have all that data on all the customers, more than 25 million customers there, 100 million on the tax side, that informs the market. Again, it's informing us on that front. And then on the other side of the business where we look at a broader range, I do think we would have done things differently. That was also newish to us in the last 10 years, we didn't do a lot of that. We did a lot of fintech and then we started to spread our wings. But I don't think there's a one-size-fits-all-all. But I do think there's a really important lesson to think about top-down what the market is rewarding.\n\nAdam: What do you look for in the people who you invest in, whether you're investing in their companies, or whether you're entrusting them with responsibility as a member of your team?\n\nJenny: We've learned a lot over the years over having more than 15 different businesses. And for sure, in our leaders, we're looking for leaders who bring out the best in their best talent. So it's a little bit of a derivative, which is the world I live in. But where the best leader leads their ego, doesn't matter how the team succeeds, as long as they succeed. What happens is, as that organization gets better, there's going to be pockets of talent. And we want all of the best talent to succeed at the highest rate because they're all going to be a reflection of the person who is leading. And all of those people can then follow all of those pieces of best talent. So I've more leaders doing better things one step down from their primary leader. So we think about it more like partners, as opposed to a triangle of CEO on down. The other thing that we look for is those who are willing to be super self-aware is critical. And those who are willing to change, which means taking risks again, of course. But I'll give you an example, we might be in a turnaround situation and have the perfect person to do that. We call them a wartime general. But when things are turning, and getting better, and now we need that peacetime general and we need a growth person, it might not be the same person anymore. And people get locked into titles and it's great when they're taking accountability. But sometimes the accountability is to say, I'm the wrong person for that stage. So now what do I do? I'm gonna lean on my partners, hopefully, I'm gonna lean on somebody else. What does that mean about titles and all these other things? We're super flexible inside of our firm, and we like people who recognize that their best and highest use may not be in that same spot anymore. So we have a lot of fluidity across our firm. So one of the things we're most proud of is the talent that is at PEAK6 but also stays at PEAK6 for so many years. Because they get to grow and develop in different ways. And they get used in the best way possible for their specific skills.\n\nAdam: As you describe what you look for in leaders who you invest in, you mentioned a couple of really important characteristics, universal to the very best leaders. Self-awareness, flexibility, being willing to change. You also mentioned something really important, which doesn't get talked about enough. If the very best leaders understand when to step up and when to step back, you are never going to be the right person for every situation. Just not possible. What is the right situation for you? What is the right company for you to lead? What is the right time for you to lead? Are you the right person? Are you the wrong person? And it does come back to self-awareness. If you understand yourself intimately, understand your strengths, understand your weaknesses, and know thyself, that will guide you. That will allow you to know, should I step up? Should I step back? Your partner at peak six is also your husband. You were colleagues and then co-founders, and business partners before becoming spouses. What have been the keys to maintaining healthy personal relationships and a healthy professional relationship when the two are so deeply intertwined? And what advice do you have for listeners on how to develop and maintain successful relationships and partnerships?\n\nJenny: Yeah, that's dangerous. We have known each other very long time. And we were many years into PEAK6 before this happened. And nobody would have guessed. Because I always say there's a fine line between love and hate because starting a firm is hard. There's a lot of risk. And there's a lot of highs and lows. So the fact that this became something is funny because you find quite a few husbands and wives that are in it. Keys, one thing we did may or may not be unique, but we have different responsibilities. I always say you can't assume I know something just because I'm married. So initially, he was the outside person, and I was the inside person. He's a top-down person, I’m a bottom-up person, so we can divide and conquer the world. Of course, those things eventually merge and chaos ensues. But I also think especially at the time, we have to think back. This is 26 years ago. The fact that we were equal partners, when we started, is probably kudos to him, he's got a really strong mom and sister. And that's why he was open-minded. I also think, that because we had started that department inside of the bank together, so he knew. But we always said he or she who has the most passion wins, because it was just two votes. Self-awareness is critical because it can go into your personal life. The maturity and growing that maturity over the years takes a lot and then you put kids on top of it. I would not say it's for the faint of heart but extraordinarily rewarding if it works. I mean, it's like a job for us, it is our world. So we're really lucky to share the highs and lows, even though it can be traumatic at times.\n\nAdam: Given your experience cultivating this unique relationship, what advice do you have for listeners on how to develop and maintain successful relationships personally and professionally?\n\nJenny: I don't know if I'm the best person. But one thing I know that I didn't do in my early years and it's funny because I wouldn't take this back when I say he was the outside person, I was the inside person. I did nothing with the outside world, including networking. And I wouldn't take it back because it allowed me what I needed to do to be the mom I wanted to be. Because there was only so much time in a day. But I do know now since I've been aggressively out there in the last couple of years, how valuable building those relationships is. And so I would figure out how to reprioritize something so I could do that in the future. But you have to be precise because there's just limited time. So how can you do it? And the beauty of the flexible workplace allows for a lot more of that today than before. But I also think you have to be smart. I always say to the women who asked how I was able to do what I did. I say don't lock yourself in any certain way because you don't know what's going to change, particularly with your children. What do you have time for? So if I have time, if I want to do this for the next quarter, this amount of networking doesn't mean I have to do it the next quarter or the next quarter, but I might do it in the fourth quarter. It doesn't mean I have to do it for the whole year. I get to control what I'm going to do and what my priority is and priorities change. People don't change, though. And so what do you need to do to create the best relationships personally and professionally, besides being a good human, that takes effort and time so you can't do everything. But if you can get a two for one, I would take it.\n\nAdam: Jenny, what can anyone listening to this conversation do to become more successful personally and professionally?\n\nJenny: Everybody has their luck. You can be in the right place at the right time. I think the question is, how do you capitalize on it? And I will tell you, you have to take risks. It's the only way. People think it's like I had to jump out of a plane. Oh, I have to start a company. No, you don't have to. You have to take greater risks, you have to take more ‘risks’ with an S. So, those start to compound and you start to learn what you're good at, what kind of risks you like to take, and you have to start earlier, which is why the beauty of getting poker as an example, you can start teaching poker at 6, 7, 8 years old. When they see it when they're 12, and 14 again, and then when they see it when they're 18 and 20, they have all that under their belt. They're not learning from scratch. Same thing with any kind of risk you're going to take. So when somebody thinks you are the right person for a job, and you're not quite sure of that, don't think about how you feel, think about why they asked you. Why would they ask if they didn't think you were right? If I wait till I'm 97% sure, the person who was good to take a risk who's 60% sure, and typically, in our industry, it tends to be the male, I'm getting behind automatically. He's not any more certain than I am certain. He's just willing to take the risk. So for certain, I said yes without not knowing I could say no. So, I got lucky. But your conscious self, if you're not getting uncomfortable, which is what risk does, everybody wants their curve to go up into the right, personal money, whatever it is. But it's going to have a ceiling. If you don't take risks. The only way it gets higher and steeper is if you take the risk, and it has to go lower to go higher. And over time, those swings start to even out, you get better and better at doing it. But if you don't start and then you wait, you wait till I can't take any risk. Because now I've got three kids in the house and that thing, that's why we have to get our women and those identify as women earlier taking those risks.\n\nAdam: Jenny, thank you for all the great advice and thank you for being a part of Thirty Minute Mentors.\n\nJenny: My pleasure.
