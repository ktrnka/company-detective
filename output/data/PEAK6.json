Her passion specifically lies in finding opportunities for women to succeed at every table — from the classroom, to the conference room, to the poker room, to the boardroom.\n\nThis passion led her to launch Poker Power in 2020 with her daughter Juliette, a woman-led company that teaches poker to all who identify as female, and by extension, teaches women strategic thinking, capital allocation, and decision-making skills. Additionally, Jenny has created programs to help women advance their careers including the Women’s Trading Experience and Women’s Technology Experience.

Recruitment-wise I’m fine with going towards that strategy but only after they invest however much money Hobbs and Gary need to buy a quality CB.

I signed an offer with Peak6 Investments. The base salary was quite low iirc. \n\nI moved to Chicago a week before my start date but didn’t get my visa in time. It came a week after my start date and Peak6 rescinded my offer. \n\nI left the country and then came back two years later and I now work as a software engineer at a FAANG making a good living. I got married and probably would’ve never met my wife had my offer not have been rescinded. \n\nSometimes, I do wonder how my life would’ve turned out if I got into prop trading. Can anyone tell me what I missed out on and what it would’ve been like had I been a trader at Peak6? \n\nAlso what is the total compensation for a trader at Peak6?

It didn’t start out that way and wasn’t intentional. It evolved into a stats game as each year, more and more people (including qualified people) apply to these companies. If everyone could do questions 1-4, then what criteria is used? Let’s add another one, Who can do a fifth? Too many people able to do five and we need to hire N people? Keep making questions 4 and 5 harder until it’s N candidates on average that can complete it. Still not enough? Okay, let’s add culture fit tie breakers, which realistically just means you have to get lucky 4 times in a row and not get the asshat architect who needs perfectly optimized 2 line recursive DP Manacher’s algorithm that compiles first time within 5 minutes.\n\nThe questions themselves aren’t hit or miss. They are actually pretty well designed and solvable by most people grinding Leetcode daily. It’s the chance of getting across the whole race that’s hit or miss. I think one article or ted talk claimed a committee of four Google hiring managers were given four hiring packets (which includes the Resume, the tech interview feedback, and the personal comments), then rejected them all. Once they revealed the names, they realized they had rejected each other’s old hiring packets from 5 or 6 years ago. Many people working at these companies believe they would not get hired again if interviewed again. People definitely got grandfathered into the industry.\n\n#### Comment ID gdga0mb with +2 score by [(bbbbjkugcbjj, Reddit, 2020-11-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/jzv4l5/most_difficult_oas_youve_ever_done/gdga0mb/) (in reply to ID gdebks4):\nDid you pass all test cases for citadel for the interview?\n\n### Comment ID gdf27pk with +8 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-11-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/jzv4l5/most_difficult_oas_youve_ever_done/gdf27pk/) (in reply to ID gde7d22):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID gdfqlph with +1 score by [(gargar070402, Reddit, 2020-11-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/jzv4l5/most_difficult_oas_youve_ever_done/gdfqlph/) (in reply to ID gdf27pk):\nGonna have to disagree with that haha.

They've said many of them are still within EG. They both shared the sentiment that many people who are at EG find her incompetent. That's partly the audience who's getting the email.\n\nAnd I've been part of several organizations that have had C suite changes including \"stepping down\" (where everyone knows they were fired) and its never even close to as over the top as this - that email is more over-the-top and deluded than if Kanye West was asked to describe himself in as generous terms as possible. The messaging in that email is absolutely not normal lmao - the sentiment is, not the actual message. \n\nAnd they made this point on the podcast but if you have people at the org who don't like her and your org has had many failures and issues during her tenure, an email like that that gasses her up to that degree doesn't exactly show how you plan to change things and how the replacement will be different, ya know, the purpose behind changing senior leadership. Orgs I've been in with changing C suite always include how the direction will change in the messaging. This could be part of a separate corporate email to come down the road but tldr from what I've seen that email is not normal and it's pretty bad.\n\n#### Comment ID jz0we9t with +22 score by [(Rymasq, Reddit, 2023-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1696zq9/horrendous_internal_email_from_eg_following/jz0we9t/) (in reply to ID jz0qpqz):\ni took a second to understand Nicole’s background. It looks like she’s a PEAK6 employee only. Basically PEAK6 finds companies to invest in and then puts someone like Nicole into the management of that company to help them grow their investment. The idea that she’s the “CEO” of EG is what was given to her due to the good graces she’s clearly formed with PEAK6 management.

You 100% need to start leveraging your Alumni connections even if they are not that good.

Honestly it comes down to luck, skills, and mostly your connections if no one at that company is advocating for you then your resume really is just a piece of paper for them especially if you have no relevant work experience. I know this sounds harsh but as someone who comes from a non-targe school and has minimal connections I've had to take mid internships.

The tech is no where close to what it should be. And yet we tell everybody we are a tech first trading firm. This is laughable because trading + tech have never collaborated well and anything coming out of this collaboration is nothing that pushes the tech stack forward. Sadly, there are so many competitors who can show us the way, but Peak6 culture is very inbred and inwards looking.\n\nAgain CTOs last here 1.5 years on average. Tells you all you need to know.",

          "cons": "There used to be a time, not long ago, when partners and senior leaders were tasked with responding to Glassdoor reviews (look through older reviews). This was to manage the message and tell the world all was well (when in fact the reality was different). Recently, this tactic has changed. A lot of negative reviews had been coming in which P6 had been trying to remove, unsuccessfully. Glassdoor policies are very strict and transparent on what can and cannot be removed. So when all the positive HR reviews had been exhausted, P6 decided to cut all ties with Glassdoor. “Why pay them when they do this to us”, was the common refrain. Instead, they have doubled down on spinning their way out of the mess called Peak6. PR has been upped, a “storyteller” has been hired, press releases have been constant, and web results are being optimized. All to overcome the negativity and dysfunction that exists at all P6 companies. They could have simply solved the problems but that would be admitting that their “strategy” is not working. Incidentally, if you read newspaper articles about an Irish football team that P6 owns you will see that they have dragged the team through utter confusion and lack of direction and a losing season. This same take exists in all of their other businesses. Confusion and lack of direction rules the day. No vision. Only whims.\r\nOver the past 12 months or so, P6 has lost their Chief Marketing Officer (and his entire team, some who had been at the firm for less than a week!). Lost their Chief People Officer. Lost the Chief Operating Officer for their largest business. Actually lost two COOs in this business in a matter of months. Lost the President of their second largest business and the COO of this business as well. The list goes on where senior leaders - veterans in their industries have decided to leave rather than continue here and wreck their career or drive themselves crazy with all the dysfunction and chaos. Supposedly, Steve Jobs was known to have said that “companies should hire smart/experienced people so that they can tell them what to do''. Here these experienced leaders were told what to do instead of relying on their knowledge, skills, and experiences. As another reviewer stated, this is the reason why the firm is big on hiring right from college or from unrelated industries - these “fresh” faces don’t know what excellence looks like and will keep their heads down and settle for whatever propaganda they are told and over time will assimilate into the collective. The CTO of their trading business has been a disaster because he has zero trading experience and has been hiring people just like him - clueless. The COO of shared services (scared services!) has been a disaster because she is an HR person who has the ability to get fluff articles written about her but does not have the ability to truly understand the businesses and lead effectively. Therein lies the rub - seasoned leaders and industry experts leave P6 in droves while those without industry and relevant experience stick around and get promoted - why?\r\nNow if after reading this you still want to work at P6, that is on you. But know that this place is an unmitigated mess. Yes, the owners make a lot of money for themselves. The street knows that P6 is cheap and underpays employees. They do not invest in technology, diversity etc. So basically all the press releases you read about how great their technology is, how great their DEI initiatives are - know that the firm is simply trying to compensate for a lack of those things - by telling the world how great they are. If these initiatives were so good, their employees would be extolling its virtues and the owners would not have to rely on PR to do just that. There are several people who have been at P6 a long time. They are fine doing the one thing they know how to do and sucking the marrow out of a drying bone. These same people have been unable to generate any new successful ideas for as long as I can remember. These same people will never find a cushy job like they have, elsewhere.",

When the entire organization is aware of this, then people start to talk more openly about it at all levels of the organization.   If you have a friend who works at PEAK6 who isn’t happy, then encourage them to look elsewhere.    If you see someone who is negative and a bad example, then call them on their behavior and the impact its having on the team.  If you aren’t comfortable doing this, reach out to someone in the organization who can partner with you or to Sarah or Tiffany.  I am open to brainstorming on any other approaches you think could work.  It only takes one person to bring an organization down so it’s critical that we find a way to work through this.

Beyond this positive feedback, it’s clear that you are very frustrated with technology priorities and results. We are very data driven across the firm and since the stats differ so greatly from your perception I’m not sure how to respond to your comments on turnover and on technology uptime. For instance last year turnover in technology fell by 22%. Inevitably there will be turnover and our technology department isn’t immune, but we work hard to keep the best technologists possible. As far as trading tool performance and pricing is concerned, in the last 6 months we have seen under 30 minutes of downtime. We can always do better in these areas, but given recent results my instinct is that something else is creating the broader frustration you have with technology. Potentially this is around how we prioritize small enhancements that traders request. This is a tricky balance. We try to focus most of our efforts on bigger projects, and we can certainly do more to communicate which smaller feature areas requested by traders are being worked on at any given time. I will connect with Ryan to work on this. If there is something else you are frustrated with, it would be great if you could share more detail with me, Brad or Tiffany so we can better understand your concern. Thanks for taking time to provide input.\r\n\r\nKris G",

It does not have world class technology. It is not hard to get a job here. It does not have world class experienced talent from the likes of Citadel, Goldman, Jump, Optiver.

          "adviceOriginal": null,
          "cons": "It is a very strange place to say the least. Strawman arguments abound. A lacking cohesive vision is considered a core competency. They are certainly not guilty of being ahead of the curve - any curve really. Objectively, they are many years behind their industry peers and do the best work leading from behind. Yet, the propaganda machine invokes trailblazers and innovators to brainwash people into believing they are something they are not. Operational excellence is a term used all the time. Again, an objective definition of operational excellence will confirm what Peak6 calls excellence, the industry peer group calls mediocrity. Although the term “industry peer” is used loosely here because CapMan is in a class by itself - all the world class prop trading firms are in another class. If Peak6 were a country they would be closest to North Korea. A community that hues to an ideology that is so ancient, so based on a cult of personalities that it is easy for outsiders to expose but difficult for lifers to understand - because they have been brainwashed. And hence the company’s insistence on hiring people right out of college, eschewing experienced trading hires (or any experienced hire from another well run peer). If they need to hire for experience, it is usually from an industry that is not financial services related. This way no one knows any better. Look at the list of experienced hires - senior people some - who come here with no experience whatsoever in financial services, let alone proprietary trading. These people take a joke of a company and make it into a sitcom worthy of a Thursday night airing on CBS. Another line used all the time is that “it is a tribe”. Yes, a tribe it is - an uncontacted one at that - which has the ideology of self-isolation. You are in the tribe, but few if any become members of the tribe. For that tenure is the only option - the longer you stay, the more you atrophy and the more you are rewarded because you have stuck around. Skills, experience, outcomes, leadership - none of these matter. Also, you are not allowed to know more than the dear leaders because doing so puts a target on your back as the egos are fragile but their pocketbook is virtually unlimited.",

          "cons": "- Entrepreneurial nature of the top management. This falls under cons because of the number of curtailed initiatives over the years. I can count around 40 of such failed initiatives off the top of my head (so I'd double that number to get a more accurate estimate). The success rate for these initiatives is less than that of a VC firm and half of them have almost nothing to do with core business. Morale suffers from that, as employees often feel that the leadership is diverting resources and attention from the core proven business fruitlessly.\r\n- Due to aforementioned culture be ready for abrupt change. (could be a pro for some).\r\n- For all this change, fundamentally, the firm hasn’t changed too much over the past 10 years. (Option House and one or two profitable strategies traded in the Hedge Fund being the sole exceptions). Incremental improvements happened of course, but that is a natural occurrence for tech-based business.\r\n- Career progression opportunities for middle management are limited. Historically, people who were brought in for a project or initiative haven't stuck around. One often hears of ideological differences, not enough resources, unclear goals and expectations as the reasons for departure. Home grown middle management often gets moved from successful projects and then either leaves or under performs due to resulting disillusionment & lack of motivation. Partnership seems to have reached critical mass - there hasn't been anyone promoted to partner for around 4-5 years.\r\n- Unmotivated leadership. Some of the partners seem to be calling it in. They are never or rarely seen to be involved. Sometimes are on sabbaticals. Founding partners are very particular and controlling, so with the high number of partners, lack of motivation is not surprising.\r\n- It’s generally agreed upon view among the employees that disagreeing with a higher management initiatives is a bad idea, and if you want to have the best chances of comparatively good bonus, you have to support the initiatives and show respect. You do have to present a non-emotional demand here and there to make sure your needs are not disregarded and you are not being \"walked on\".",

          "cons": "There is a review comparing P6 to N. Korea. If I think about this, I can see why that is being said. PROPAGANDA - P6's core competency. For most of its history, P6 has been an average performing company (compared to peers). Then in 2020 P6 hit is big - but then again so did most, if not all, of the competitors. The difference, the competitors made 4-5x what P6 did. Then P6 tried to take their clearing firm, Apex, public. We were told that this is a cutting edge deal which will give Apex the capital and liquidity to become a behemoth and is the best thing that can happen. Then one day, poof, the deal vanishes and no comment. The propaganda mill, however, has been churning out the talking points - things like - Apex is better off not going public, too much scrutiny of public companies, they don't need the capital. Basically everything they had said for the deal is now being said against the deal. And that is the real issue here - no idea what the truth is - but in order to survive you have to just blindly believe what is being fed to you. If you question it, you are gone!\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n-Trading tech is so broken, so obsolete. Versus its peers, P6 spends pennies on technology as a %age of Net Rev. Yet it claims they are a tech powerhouse when in reality the most innovative thing done over the past few years has been an \"App Store\" where traders can download some interesting tools.\r\n\r\n-One strategy. That is right, P6 sells vol and that is all they do. There is nothing else here. Compared to other option houses, P6 is small. Their market share is negligible. Yet it claims they are a trading powerhouse when in reality the most innovative thing done over the past few years was moving from an individual trader to a team trader concept.\r\n\r\n-I will leave with one more. It is said that people don't leave P6 and the senior traders have been here since the beginning. Yes, P6 has many people with over 10 years with P6 and with under 2 years with P6 - the middle, however, is missing. Most of the people leave after a few years and those that make it to the 10 year mark are click traders who cannot leave because the other trading firms have no need for them. You see, click trading is an ancient relic not used in the modern trading world because technology does most, if not all of the heavy lifting. Look at SIG, IMC, Wolve, Jane, Virtu, etc. etc. So these so called trading leaders will never get a cushy job like this elsewhere. And this also means other ambitious traders who could move the company forward will never be given a chance to lead because they will be no open spots.",

          "cons": "1. Don’t believe what HR or your interviewers tell you about Capman. There is NO world class technology at play here - tech is 5-7 years old and behind the times. There is no innovation- they have been trading 1 thing for most of their history. All the talk about a female owner and woman power is talk. Capman is run by middle aged white men and ALL trading leads are men. \r\n\r\n2. Opportunities are very limited as trading leads run their own ship and have not been able to innovate outside of single name options. They missed cryptos completely. They missed futures. They missed everything else. But they did get into Spacs and only because the head trader was able to push his agenda through with help from the owners. Every other initiative has failed or has never been tried because there are very few if any people who can innovate here.\r\n\r\n3. For new employees it is important to see and interact with others with relevant experiences. Most of the people I interact with have been here forever and this has been their only job. So their outlook is heavily skewed and conflicted. So you will not get the entire perspective and you certainly will not know what is supposed to be world class because you will be constantly told that what we do is world class.\r\n\r\n4. Tech is so bad. Traders wait months for simple tools. Data to make good decisions is unavailable or when available, is incorrect or not easy to access. I have never worked for the Government, but I imagine this is what it would be like. Backwards, not cutting edge, Bureaucratic, surrounded by a lot of senior people with little to no relevant experience.\r\n\r\n5. Trading and technology have a strangely adversarial relationship. Part of the problem stems from the fact that the person heading up technology did not come from a trading company and has no track record of success. He has introduced bureaucracy, processes that adds zero value and slows things down, but is able to convince the owners of what he is doing is rocket science. The other problem is that the software developers that we have been hiring again come from non-trading backgrounds. Because of this they are unable to fully understand what the traders want or need and then traders have to spend hours after hours with product managers explaining in detail what they want done. If developers had the relevant experience this process would be seamless. If leadership in technology had the relevant experience this process would be seamless.",

Unclear what the basis/logic for their performance scoring metrics is- transparency in general is an issue. The culture can be catty and people play favorites. Basically, if you can get in line and drink the kool-aid, you'll do well here. If not, eventually they'll fire you for it or you'll get tired and leave.

Yes.\r\n\r\n- Did I love waking up at 5:30 AM to make to the office on time to complete reports and watch the market open? Not so much.\r\n\r\n- Was I working with some incredibly smart people that I look up to this very day?  ABSOLUTELY.\r\n\r\nI hope for nothing but the best for P6 in the future.  Please let some of my \"negative\" comments marinate.  I'm sure there is room for improvement in those areas, and I wouldn't be surprised if some current higher-ups didn't at least partially agree with those sentiments.",
          "adviceOriginal": null,
          "cons": "- Very little tech support beyond what is provided for the trading desk.  I understand the reasoning for this, but it would have been nice to have a dedicated team of individuals that might have helped streamline some of the trader support / compliance / monitoring tasks that continued to pile on as the firm grew in size during my 2+ years at the firm.  I suppose that is the nature of the business, unfortunately, so I don't see that changing at P6 anytime soon,\r\n\r\n- Little to no chance for mobility within the firm as a non-trader unless you have made the political connections neccessary to put yourself in such a position. To be frank, if you get a job here and realize your manager(s) is (are) not going to advocate for you to the extent that you might deem fair, especially given the effort expended for them, you are most likely S.O.L.  That's not to say movement upward through the firm can't be done -- it's just that I don't know anyone who has pulled it off.  It is very hard to stay motivated when you come to realize this is the case and you feel your career is stalling at the ripe ages of 23 - 26.\r\n\r\n- This is directed at the partnership -- particularly CapMan partners and DHs -- if you task someone with a drill-down project looking at return volatility, market trends, option liquidity, division profitability, et al, it would be greatly appreciated if the process were iterative, with an open dialogue kept between the requestor and requestee.  I know that partners and DHs are unbelievable busy, but guidance and collaboration (in terms of ideas) is critical to really nailiing down some of the initiatives that are being looked at.",

We have tried to be thoughtful around the issues you raise, but some of these decisions are a philosophical choice.  We can probably do better communicating why we make these decisions.  With hiring, a few years ago we made a conscious strategy choice to focus on undergraduate hiring.   We reviewed data on trader results over a 10 year period, and data highlighted that when we hire recent graduates and invest in training over a 2 year period, they perform significantly better than experienced traders who we hire.  There are some exceptions – we hired Liz Clark who brings a breadth of experience – but in general our strategy is more focused on campus hiring.   If you have any other feedback on other areas please feel free to reach out to me at bgoldberg@peak6.com.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nBrad",

I agree we are still evolving from a trading firm to a broader organization operating multiple businesses in financial services and other industries.   Hopefully the all hands we did right after this post helped provide more context on how we make decisions around our business portfolio.  We wanted to spend time on our investment approach so everyone at the firm can understand the breadth of opportunities and think about their career paths.  We think that career paths should be driven by the individual thinking about their strengths and ambitions; instead of the firm directing people to move from role to role in a specific way.  I also agree that the incentive piece is tricky and this is an iterative process for us to build out a clearer philosophy.   If you have any other feedback feel free to reach out directly to me. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nBrad",

Privately owned and - like all such places - subject to abrupt changes of directions based on perceived state of the market, a stroke of genius or just to get a power trip. Lack of technical direction - a blessing for the initiatives of individual contributors - leading to a sprawl of technologies and code , that will become unmanageable and unsustainable over time. It already is, in places. All these super-smart people have built a system that only super-smart people can remember, maintain and operate - a heavy weight to carry into the future. Senior technical leadership are always looking over their shoulder to the owners mood, not really empowered to do much and - anyway - fearing their - admittedly good pay too much to make any decision. This is common in the software industry at that level, but Peak6 does have an additional history of uncommonly high attrition in this area. Individual contributors have learned not to pay attention to what higher management is saying since they are a passing nuisance anyway ; another worrying indication for the future of the department.",

I can count around 40 of such failed initiatives off the top of my head (so I'd double that number to get a more accurate estimate). The success rate for these initiatives is less than that of a VC firm and half of them have almost nothing to do with core business. Morale suffers from that, as employees often feel that the leadership is diverting resources and attention from the core proven business fruitlessly.\r\n- Due to aforementioned culture be ready for abrupt change. (could be a pro for some).\r\n- For all this change, fundamentally, the firm hasn’t changed too much over the past 10 years. (Option House and one or two profitable strategies traded in the Hedge Fund being the sole exceptions). Incremental improvements happened of course, but that is a natural occurrence for tech-based business.\r\n- Career progression opportunities for middle management are limited. Historically, people who were brought in for a project or initiative haven't stuck around. One often hears of ideological differences, not enough resources, unclear goals and expectations as the reasons for departure. Home grown middle management often gets moved from successful projects and then either leaves or under performs due to resulting disillusionment & lack of motivation. Partnership seems to have reached critical mass - there hasn't been anyone promoted to partner for around 4-5 years.\r\n- Unmotivated leadership. Some of the partners seem to be calling it in. They are never or rarely seen to be involved. Sometimes are on sabbaticals. Founding partners are very particular and controlling, so with the high number of partners, lack of motivation is not surprising.\r\n- It’s generally agreed upon view among the employees that disagreeing with a higher management initiatives is a bad idea, and if you want to have the best chances of comparatively good bonus, you have to support the initiatives and show respect. You do have to present a non-emotional demand here and there to make sure your needs are not disregarded and you are not being \"walked on\".",

There are 3-4 events throughout the year with company anniversary party being the culmination. There are yoga classes, ping-pong and sporadic sports league involvement.\r\n- In trading the pay tends to be fair (i.e. merit based) even for junior personal. Jr Trader has a chance to make good money under the right circumstances in year 2 on the job.\r\n- Bonuses are predictable to a reasonable extent in trading (not so much in tech).\r\n- Competitive base salary in the tech department.",

I suppose that is the nature of the business, unfortunately, so I don't see that changing at P6 anytime soon,\r\n\r\n- Little to no chance for mobility within the firm as a non-trader unless you have made the political connections neccessary to put yourself in such a position. To be frank, if you get a job here and realize your manager(s) is (are) not going to advocate for you to the extent that you might deem fair, especially given the effort expended for them, you are most likely S.O.L.  That's not to say movement upward through the firm can't be done -- it's just that I don't know anyone who has pulled it off.  It is very hard to stay motivated when you come to realize this is the case and you feel your career is stalling at the ripe ages of 23 - 26.\r\n\r\n- This is directed at the partnership -- particularly CapMan partners and DHs -- if you task someone with a drill-down project looking at return volatility, market trends, option liquidity, division profitability, et al, it would be greatly appreciated if the process were iterative, with an open dialogue kept between the requestor and requestee.

        "cons": "It is a very strange place to say the least. Strawman arguments abound. A lacking cohesive vision is considered a core competency. They are certainly not guilty of being ahead of the curve - any curve really. Objectively, they are many years behind their industry peers and do the best work leading from behind. Yet, the propaganda machine invokes trailblazers and innovators to brainwash people into believing they are something they are not. Operational excellence is a term used all the time. Again, an objective definition of operational excellence will confirm what Peak6 calls excellence, the industry peer group calls mediocrity. Although the term “industry peer” is used loosely here because CapMan is in a class by itself - all the world class prop trading firms are in another class. If Peak6 were a country they would be closest to North Korea. A community that hues to an ideology that is so ancient, so based on a cult of personalities that it is easy for outsiders to expose but difficult for lifers to understand - because they have been brainwashed. And hence the company’s insistence on hiring people right out of college, eschewing experienced trading hires (or any experienced hire from another well run peer). If they need to hire for experience, it is usually from an industry that is not financial services related. This way no one knows any better. Look at the list of experienced hires - senior people some - who come here with no experience whatsoever in financial services, let alone proprietary trading. These people take a joke of a company and make it into a sitcom worthy of a Thursday night airing on CBS. Another line used all the time is that “it is a tribe”. Yes, a tribe it is - an uncontacted one at that - which has the ideology of self-isolation. You are in the tribe, but few if any become members of the tribe. For that tenure is the only option - the longer you stay, the more you atrophy and the more you are rewarded because you have stuck around. Skills, experience, outcomes, leadership - none of these matter.

There is no innovation- they have been trading 1 thing for most of their history. All the talk about a female owner and woman power is talk. Capman is run by middle aged white men and ALL trading leads are men. \r\n\r\n2. Opportunities are very limited as trading leads run their own ship and have not been able to innovate outside of single name options. They missed cryptos completely. They missed futures. They missed everything else. But they did get into Spacs and only because the head trader was able to push his agenda through with help from the owners. Every other initiative has failed or has never been tried because there are very few if any people who can innovate here.\r\n\r\n3. For new employees it is important to see and interact with others with relevant experiences. Most of the people I interact with have been here forever and this has been their only job. So their outlook is heavily skewed and conflicted. So you will not get the entire perspective and you certainly will not know what is supposed to be world class because you will be constantly told that what we do is world class.\r\n\r\n4. Tech is so bad. Traders wait months for simple tools. Data to make good decisions is unavailable or when available, is incorrect or not easy to access. I have never worked for the Government, but I imagine this is what it would be like. Backwards, not cutting edge, Bureaucratic, surrounded by a lot of senior people with little to no relevant experience.\r\n\r\n5. Trading and technology have a strangely adversarial relationship. Part of the problem stems from the fact that the person heading up technology did not come from a trading company and has no track record of success. He has introduced bureaucracy, processes that adds zero value and slows things down, but is able to convince the owners of what he is doing is rocket science. The other problem is that the software developers that we have been hiring again come from non-trading backgrounds. Because of this they are unable to fully understand what the traders want or need and then traders have to spend hours after hours with product managers explaining in detail what they want done. If developers had the relevant experience this process would be seamless. If leadership in technology had the relevant experience this process would be seamless.",

        "cons": "There used to be a time, not long ago, when partners and senior leaders were tasked with responding to Glassdoor reviews (look through older reviews). This was to manage the message and tell the world all was well (when in fact the reality was different). Recently, this tactic has changed. A lot of negative reviews had been coming in which P6 had been trying to remove, unsuccessfully. Glassdoor policies are very strict and transparent on what can and cannot be removed. So when all the positive HR reviews had been exhausted, P6 decided to cut all ties with Glassdoor. “Why pay them when they do this to us”, was the common refrain. Instead, they have doubled down on spinning their way out of the mess called Peak6. PR has been upped, a “storyteller” has been hired, press releases have been constant, and web results are being optimized. All to overcome the negativity and dysfunction that exists at all P6 companies. They could have simply solved the problems but that would be admitting that their “strategy” is not working. Incidentally, if you read newspaper articles about an Irish football team that P6 owns you will see that they have dragged the team through utter confusion and lack of direction and a losing season. This same take exists in all of their other businesses. Confusion and lack of direction rules the day. No vision. Only whims.\r\nOver the past 12 months or so, P6 has lost their Chief Marketing Officer (and his entire team, some who had been at the firm for less than a week!). Lost their Chief People Officer. Lost the Chief Operating Officer for their largest business. Actually lost two COOs in this business in a matter of months. Lost the President of their second largest business and the COO of this business as well. The list goes on where senior leaders - veterans in their industries have decided to leave rather than continue here and wreck their career or drive themselves crazy with all the dysfunction and chaos. Supposedly, Steve Jobs was known to have said that “companies should hire smart/experienced people so that they can tell them what to do''. Here these experienced leaders were told what to do instead of relying on their knowledge, skills, and experiences. As another reviewer stated, this is the reason why the firm is big on hiring right from college or from unrelated industries - these “fresh” faces don’t know what excellence looks like and will keep their heads down and settle for whatever propaganda they are told and over time will assimilate into the collective. The CTO of their trading business has been a disaster because he has zero trading experience and has been hiring people just like him - clueless. The COO of shared services (scared services!) has been a disaster because she is an HR person who has the ability to get fluff articles written about her but does not have the ability to truly understand the businesses and lead effectively. Therein lies the rub - seasoned leaders and industry experts leave P6 in droves while those without industry and relevant experience stick around and get promoted - why?\r\nNow if after reading this you still want to work at P6, that is on you. But know that this place is an unmitigated mess. Yes, the owners make a lot of money for themselves. The street knows that P6 is cheap and underpays employees. They do not invest in technology, diversity etc. So basically all the press releases you read about how great their technology is, how great their DEI initiatives are - know that the firm is simply trying to compensate for a lack of those things - by telling the world how great they are. If these initiatives were so good, their employees would be extolling its virtues and the owners would not have to rely on PR to do just that. There are several people who have been at P6 a long time. They are fine doing the one thing they know how to do and sucking the marrow out of a drying bone. These same people have been unable to generate any new successful ideas for as long as I can remember. These same people will never find a cushy job like they have, elsewhere.",

For most of its history, P6 has been an average performing company (compared to peers). Then in 2020 P6 hit is big - but then again so did most, if not all, of the competitors. The difference, the competitors made 4-5x what P6 did. Then P6 tried to take their clearing firm, Apex, public. We were told that this is a cutting edge deal which will give Apex the capital and liquidity to become a behemoth and is the best thing that can happen. Then one day, poof, the deal vanishes and no comment. The propaganda mill, however, has been churning out the talking points - things like - Apex is better off not going public, too much scrutiny of public companies, they don't need the capital. Basically everything they had said for the deal is now being said against the deal. And that is the real issue here - no idea what the truth is - but in order to survive you have to just blindly believe what is being fed to you. If you question it, you are gone!\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n-Trading tech is so broken, so obsolete. Versus its peers, P6 spends pennies on technology as a %age of Net Rev. Yet it claims they are a tech powerhouse when in reality the most innovative thing done over the past few years has been an \"App Store\" where traders can download some interesting tools.\r\n\r\n-One strategy. That is right, P6 sells vol and that is all they do. There is nothing else here. Compared to other option houses, P6 is small. Their market share is negligible. Yet it claims they are a trading powerhouse when in reality the most innovative thing done over the past few years was moving from an individual trader to a team trader concept.\r\n\r\n-I will leave with one more. It is said that people don't leave P6 and the senior traders have been here since the beginning. Yes, P6 has many people with over 10 years with P6 and with under 2 years with P6 - the middle, however, is missing. Most of the people leave after a few years and those that make it to the 10 year mark are click traders who cannot leave because the other trading firms have no need for them. You see, click trading is an ancient relic not used in the modern trading world because technology does most, if not all of the heavy lifting. Look at SIG, IMC, Wolve, Jane, Virtu, etc. etc. So these so called trading leaders will never get a cushy job like this elsewhere. And this also means other ambitious traders who could move the company forward will never be given a chance to lead because they will be no open spots.",

      "# [A National STEM/STEAM Day Conversation with Dan Collins by ckohake@peak6.com on 2023-11-08](https://peak6.com/a-national-stem-steam-day-conversation-with-dan-collins/)\nWe had the pleasure of sitting down with Dan Collins, Chief Architect at PEAK6 Capital Management to discuss all things STEM/STEAM — from what caught his interest at a young age to his education to his hopes for the future. Here’s what he had to say:\n\nWhen did you first have an interest in a STEM/STEAM career?\n\nIf I’m being honest, it wasn’t until probably late high school/early college before I thought seriously about a STEAM career. I’ve always been interested in figuring out how things work and building a better understanding of the world around me. Finding others who share that same curiosity and working with them to find new opportunities, solve problems, and build together really made a career in STEAM the right fit for me.\n\nWhat was your favorite school subject or STEM/STEAM related class?\n\nMy favorite subjects in school were those where the instructor pushed me to be a more creative problem solver. As someone interested in STEAM, I enjoyed the usual suspects in math and computer science (e.g. discrete math, linear algebra, data structures and algos, programming languages, etc). However, the class that I often think back on the most was my first computer science course. It gave me a realistic view of computer science as a discipline and challenged my resolve. At the end of the course, I was proud of my work and excited for the challenges and opportunities to come.\n\nWho influenced you the most in school?\n\nI’ve been fortunate to have had many great mentors during my schooling. However, the person who influenced me the most in school was one of my computer science instructors, Mary Sheila-Tracy. She was the instructor for the intro to computer science course that I mentioned previously as well as courses on usability engineering and computer ethics. The most important lesson I learned from her is that building software is just as much about the people building it as it is about the software you’re building. If you can work together with others while identifying and harnessing each others’ strengths, the impact you can have is much greater than what you can do on your own. She preferred group projects for her assignments and getting people to try new things outside their area of expertise. I learned a lot about the foundations of computer science and effective collaboration through her teaching.\n\nWhat advice would you give to a young person interested in a STEM/STEAM career?\n\nThere’s no one right way to pursue a career in STEAM. Instead, focus on building a strong foundation in critical thinking, problem solving, and logical reasoning. Let this foundation serve you wherever your interests lead you and stay curious. Over time your interests will change and you’ll want to be challenged in new ways. If you’ve built this strong foundation, you’ll find you have more opportunities to grow and more flexibility in where you can apply yourself.\n\nWhat do you hope the future of STEM will look like?\n\nI hope that a focus on STEAM is even more standard than it is today and results in more opportunities for people choosing a career. I also hope this increased exposure to STEAM results in more diversity of thought in our scientific and technology-based fields.\n\nWhat led you to PEAK6? Has PEAK6 furthered your love of STEM?\n\nI was really drawn to PEAK6 because of the opportunities they were exploring, the challenging problem-space, and the teams I would be working with in Capital Management. Now, four years later, I’m proud to have been a part of growing the product and technology organization in Capital Management as well as working across PEAK6 companies on several occasions. Through all of this, PEAK6 has reinforced my love of STEAM and I’m grateful to work alongside so many talented engineers who have that same mindset. We continue to apply what we’ve learned from our various backgrounds in STEAM and work together solving hard problems as we evolve our trading systems for the future.",
      "# [Visionary Fintech Entrepreneur Jenny Just to Receive Honorary Doctor of Business from Illinois Tech on 2024-05-11](https://www.iit.edu/news/visionary-fintech-entrepreneur-jenny-just-receive-honorary-doctor-business-illinois-tech)\nCHICAGO—May 11, 2024—Illinois Institute of Technology (Illinois Tech) will award Jenny Just, a renowned entrepreneur and one of the few self-made female billionaires in the United States, an Honorary Doctor of Business, honoris causa. After cutting her teeth on the trading floor in Chicago, Just launched her own investment firm and transformed it into a fintech empire, including more than 15 companies that she has started or helped turn around.\n\n“I am deeply honored to receive this recognition from Illinois Tech,” said Just. “It’s a humbling tribute to my work, and it also serves as a powerful motivator for the future. I’m committed to using my platform to continue advocating for educational equity and inspiring the next generation of leaders, especially women, to pursue their aspirations, goals, and dreams.”\n\nJust co-founded PEAK6 in 1997 with $1.5 million in seed capital, initially focusing on proprietary options trading. Under her leadership, PEAK6 has evolved into a multibillion-dollar financial services and technology empire, housing the next generation of products and service brands, including PEAK6 Capital Management, PEAK6 Strategic Capital, Apex Fintech Solutions, Apex Crypto, and PEAK6 InsurTech, as well as esports franchise Evil Geniuses and financial literacy app Zogo.\n\n“Jenny Just exemplifies Illinois Tech’s spirit of innovation and leadership,” said Illinois Tech President Raj Echambadi. “Her profound impact on the finance industry and her unwavering commitment to raising up others inspires our whole university community.”\n\nWith a true knack for unearthing talent and opportunities, Just looks for underfunded and underappreciated sectors to transform into high-growth businesses. Her passion specifically lies in finding opportunities for women to succeed at every table—from the classroom, to the conference room, to the poker room, to the board room.\n\nIn 2020 Jenny Just and her daughter Juliette launched Poker Power, a woman-led company that teaches poker to all who identify as female, and by extension, teaches strategic thinking, capital allocation, and decision-making skills. Additionally, Just has continued to create programs to help women advance their careers, including the Women’s Trading Experience and Women’s Technology Experience.\n\n“I can’t think of a better role model for our students than Jenny Just,” said Liad Wagman, dean of the Stuart School of Business. “Jenny Just embodies the innovativeness, strategic thinking, and determination required to make a tremendous impact in the business world. Her commitment to harnessing untapped market opportunities, leveraging technology for inclusive business success, and lifting others up, are inspirations for current and future leaders.”\n\nJust received a B.B.A in Business, Management, Marketing, and Related Support Services from the Stephen M. Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan in 1990.\n\nJust’s honorary degree will be conferred during Illinois Tech’s 155th Commencement ceremony on May 11, 2024 at Credit Union 1 Arena.\n\nPhoto: Jenny Just\n\nIllinois Institute of Technology\n\nBased in the global metropolis of Chicago, Illinois Tech was born to liberate the power of collective difference to advance technology and innovation for all.

Their journey started as options traders at O'Connor and Associates in Chicago, where they gained experience and a knack for taking calculated risks. When O'Connor and Associates relocated to the East Coast, Just and Hulsizer chose to remain in Chicago.\n\nPEAK6 began as a proprietary equity options trading firm. It leveraged its trading profits to fund various ventures, embracing opportunities with a focus on learning from each experience, regardless of success. As markets evolved, PEAK6 launched OptionsHouse, a hedge fund and retail broker-dealer, setting the stage for a pivotal moment.\n\nWhen the custodian and clearing firm for OptionsHouse, Penson Financial Services, faced bankruptcy, PEAK6 stepped in, acquiring what would become Apex Fintech Solutions.[5] This move not only saved OptionsHouse but also positioned PEAK6 as a technology-forward disruptor in the industry. Brokerage firms seeking modern technology solutions soon partnered with PEAK6.\n\nIts OptionsHouse, LLC subsidiary was rated among the best brokers for options traders by Barron's in March of 2009.[6] However, OptionsHouse was acquired by E*Trade on September 12, 2016 for $725 million.[7]\n\nOver the years, PEAK6 diversified its portfolio with ventures and acquisitions spanning cryptocurrency, esports, finance education, and more. The firm also has a simulated trading facility called WeSeed LLC (or www.WeSeed.com), which provides beginner traders with a platform to learn how to trade stocks.\n\nPEAK6 also has interests in financial technology firms Stockgroup and ELX Electronic Liquidity Exchange and invests in and runs hedge funds.[8] Its subsidiary PEAK6 Capital Management is an options market maker and proprietary trading firm.\n\nIn September 2014 the company said it would spin out its $2.3 billion hedge-fund business, Peak6 Advisors, which would change its name to Achievement Asset Management and focus on growth by trading European credit and stocks out of a new London office. The renamed business will continue to be led by CEO Joseph Scoby, who will buy out the roughly 50% stake in the hedge-fund business that Peak6 Investments owns.[9]\n\nIn September 2020 BBC News reported PEAKS6 was looking to add an office in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The company said it planned to create 160 new jobs in Northern Ireland over four years, with the help of more than £1m of support from Invest Northern Ireland.

      "# [Thirty Minute Mentors Podcast Transcript: PEAK6 Co by Adam Mendler on 2024-02-13](https://www.adammendler.com/blog/jenny-just)\nI recently interviewed PEAK6 Co-Founder Jenny Just on my podcast, Thirty Minute Mentors. Here is a transcript of our interview:\n\nAdam: Our guest today is a member of a highly select group of women who are self-made billionaires. Jenny Just is the co-founder and managing director of PEAK6, a multibillion-dollar financial services and technology company. Jenny, thank you for joining us.\n\nJenny: Thank you. I'm so excited to be here.\n\nAdam: Excited to have you on. You grew up in Wisconsin and did your undergrad at the University of Michigan before moving to Chicago to take an entry-level job at a financial services firm. Can you take listeners back to your early days, what early experiences and lessons shaped your worldview and shaped the trajectory of your success?\n\nJenny: Sure, I'd be happy to do that. I started my career out of undergrad on the Chicago Board Options Exchange trading floor with a company called O'Connor and Associates who are infamous in the options world. And I have to say, I had no idea what I was going to do. I had no idea what options trading was. And I ended up taking that job because it was very early days and dressing casual kind of world. They also served food. Google didn't exist back then. So Haagen Dazs and beer in the fridge was really enticing to my 21-year-old self. And my very first day on the exchange Drexel Burnham declared bankruptcy and the market went bananas. So, I was taken down there and I did not know what I was gonna experience. And for those of you who haven't seen Trading Places are one of the infamous Wall Street movies. It's like game day every day, screaming and yelling, lots of large men, and very few people who look like myself down there. So, it's highly entertaining. But also, it's like a foreign world. And I was super lucky to learn it. That's what I have to say. It's a language not a lot of people learn. Even in the financial industry, going all the way to the far right of that curve is our learning options. And they're like puzzle pieces. So they not only help you think about the financial products, so I happen to do options on stocks. But they help you to think about all the different places of a business, which I didn't know at the time, I was just learning options trading. But eventually, when I left O'Connor, they had done a deal with Swiss Bank and eventually became UBS. And we were going off on our own. But how you put pieces of your risk profile together is something we learned quite literally on the trading floor, but then used quite figuratively in other ways when we started to build a business. So I'm very fortunate to have learned what I learned. The other big thing you learn when you learn trading is you learn how to make quick decisions. And clearly, you don't have all the information and the opportunity to do that over and over and fail the majority of the time. So when you look at the portfolio of options that we have, it's an original business we started 26 years ago, called PEAK6 Capital Management, and it's never had a losing year to this day. And that's the thing that's funded all the other businesses we've done, but we lose 46% of our trades. So some high number, hopefully not over 50%. But you get really used to taking risks. And I think it was super opportunistic that I was able to do that at such a young age.\n\nAdam: Can you dive a little bit deeper into your approach to decision-making and your approach to taking and managing risk?\n\nJenny: Sure. I generally thought I was a pretty good decision-maker. Not until you're forced to make them by yourself, one on one with the market do you realize you're not as good as you think. And it's one of the reasons why for people who are not interested necessarily, first of all, they're not in the industry, so they're not trading. But you have to manage your money. And many people will say, \"I'll use an advisor.\" But even if you use an advisor, trading stocks for yourself, you learn so much. You don't have to trade very much, we have fractional shares today. One of our businesses was the first one to bring that to market, Apex FinTech Solutions. But you've learned so much by doing that transaction. And so the interesting thing many years later, though, what I would say about me learning, and thinking I was a good decision maker, and then of course, practicing it over and over again. In the trading world, there are a lot of people in our world that play poker. And I never did. I was the opposite of that. And it turns out that poker is an incredible way to think about making decisions with incomplete information. And so I learned later in life, and I say to this day, if I had learned poker much earlier, I would have taken 10 years out of my failures, because it gives such a framework for thinking about how to make a decision, because there are so many things that are happening at a poker table. And some people have more or less chips than you, there are more or less powerful positions than you. You have two cards that you're dealt but ends up not being about the cards. It's how you play against the people you're sitting with. So my partners and I today, now that I've learned this game of poker, and I don't have to play for money to get all the skills, let's be clear, is we use poker as a framework very simply. What cards do you think they have? Are we in a deal or a negotiation? What cards do I think they have? And we're going to think different things. But now the question is why? What are you seeing that I'm not seeing? And what can I learn from what you're seeing? And then we can go through the whole play. What do you think has come out on the table already? Five cards come out and poker in a community game. And where do you think we are, and how much is in the pot, and how much they bet? You can use poker as a framework for decision-making. And if you've never done it before, and you're a poker player and trying to do it, your colleagues who haven't played, it's an amazing mentor-mentee opportunity to get inside their head on how they're approaching a decision. So that's been for sure, the most recent, what's called the last four years, way, I've been trying to approach creating a systematic way to make decisions. A decision is a risk by definition. It could be a small risk, or it can be a large risk, but it is a risk. And if you're not comfortable doing that, the most important thing you can do is practice doing it more, don't avoid it. Because those decisions start to compound on each other. You start to learn so much from each decision that you make, and each fail, of course, or success that you have along the way. So we created Poker Power Play, which is a poker app. In my opinion, the only gender-neutral poker app that's out there. And each hand is an opportunity to make a decision. But each game, of course, is an opportunity to think about decisions in a larger way, strategy versus tactics. And we've had a lot of fun, trying to take something that feels subjective and make it more objective.\n\nAdam: Get comfortable being uncomfortable. How did PEAK6 come together? And how were you able to turn it into a multibillion-dollar business?\n\nJenny: That's exactly right. It's not an option, whether something's going to be uncomfortable in the future. You know it's going to be, you may as well prep yourself and give yourself the best opportunity. I always talk about a journey. What relationship, whether it's your relationship with your work with a spouse or a partner, or your relationship with money, none of them are smooth? None of them. There are always going to be ups and downs. Now, what are you going to do as a result of when those ups and downs come? Well, if I can be a better decision-maker, it's one of the reasons why it's incredibly important for women to start to play poker. It's why we're on a mission to teach a million women a game. Because poker is a male-dominated game. 93% or more than 100 million people in the world have played poker, we think the number is much bigger. Nobody knows a number, or men, they get this practice of making those small decisions at a young age, often, often often. And it's not part of our play, or our habits or things that those who identify as women typically are doing. So if you're a dad, and you have a daughter, your daughter should be playing as well as your son should be playing. Because the more I get to practice doing it, there's something I talk about the compound experience. So like compound interest, we know there's an exponential curve. If I reinvest my interest, once I get my principal, I get my interest. Then my interest gets interest and interest. Same thing with those early experiences. The more I get a chance to make those decisions, the more they capitalize on themselves. I learned more earlier. So I have greater learnings to apply later. They compound on themselves. It's part of certainly why I have been able to accomplish what I have been able to accomplish. Because I took a lot of risk early on. I didn't know I was doing it. I always laugh and I say, I didn't know I could say no. So I kept saying yes. I wasn't brilliant at it. I just got a lot of practice.\n\nAdam: How did PEAK6 come together? And how were you able to turn it into a multibillion-dollar business?\n\nJenny: PEAK6 came together, not because we were necessarily in 26 years ago, the entrepreneurship that we talked about today, and all the angel and VC stuff that happens today. And so many people are involved. It certainly wasn't in my vernacular, it wasn't in my world, and the internet's just basically getting running. And our company O'Connor, then Swiss bank, UBS was moving. We were fortunate enough to help start a department, my co-founder, myself, we're fortunate enough to start a department at the bank, in the over-the-counter equity derivative world. So this is not an exchange-traded product. So I had this experience young. It was just me and him. And there was a gentleman who was brought in from Goldman, because O'Connor, at the time didn't do that business. It was the banks who did that business. We brought in a gentleman and it was just us in a room trying to figure out how to sell derivatives to companies, to institutions. And so we had that experience under a belt. And when the bank decided to move and located out in Stanford, we said, well, for personal reasons, we're staying behind. And we said, well, we'll just do that again. I mean, we're naive, honestly. And the interesting thing is our original plan, we've never done. So that was what we call Plan A, we are going to redo that, go out to the Corpus. Because it's just a couple of us in a room doing it the last time. Why can't we just do that again? Well, you need a credit rating to do that. And, with two people in a room and $1.6 million, that's not getting you anywhere. So we tried to partner with banks to do what we were doing. And we got to the 11th hour interestingly, with Jamie Dimon who was at First Chicago, and this is about a year and a change into having started the firm. And we just couldn't get a deal done. Kept delaying, delaying, delaying. Not Jamie's issue, I'm sure, but generally the bank to get things done. And we looked at each other, we said, this may never happen. And now what? The fact that we looked at ourselves in the mirror and said, let's be real. We're not making money. I was a single mom at the time. And I was like, we had worked six, seven years at our previous firm and made okay money for our age, but we got to make some money. So we looked at each other. And fortuitously, we had met a gentleman. And so we started doing some work. We said we needed to start trading, which we had already started. But we need to ramp into this trading. And we met someone who said, \"You can use technology.\" And we said, \"No, we don't know about technology.\" My co-founder was an English major, I was a business major at Michigan. So we started, I put our first server together, and we got our hands dirty. And we started to imagine a world where you had to be on the exchange floor, we were the first off-floor equity trading firms ever as far as we know. And we started the experiment. So we had interns and we said, \"Well, we're going to have some of you go to the trading floor and some of you will not go to the trading floor. And let's see what happens. Because we thought the trading floor was the place to be. So we're open-minded to something that didn't exist and doing it differently, mostly because we knew we couldn't populate the exchange floors. Like we're just a couple of kids in a room. Like what do we know about managing people who are sitting in California or New York? So if we don't want to do that, what is another option? What people should take from that is, what do you want to do? And I knew I didn't want to manage a lot of people. Ironically, today, having a couple of 1000 people and having gone up and down as buying and selling firms, my goal was not to have more than 10 people work for us because I didn't think we knew better. So we did what we needed to do for us to be our best selves. And that started the journey. Things changed the technology, and the idea worked. And that's the business that now has been able to fund us for all our different opportunities over the years.\n\nAdam: It's a great lesson and there are a lot of great lessons in there. Failure can breed success. Your initial business model didn't work. You found a better business model. You found a business model that took you to where you are today. How did that happen? You were open-minded. You were flexible. You are adaptable, you are willing to get your hands dirty, you aren't afraid to try new things, and you aren't afraid to experiment. That's how you did it.\n\nJenny: Yeah. And it's funny over the years because we had the freedom to take risks, and people don't think they own the freedom when they work for somebody else. But you own your freedom to take risks. And the firm I worked at was like that O'Connor was like that. I'm forever grateful to the O'Connor partners. Because I had that freedom all along. It's just whether I use it or not. And in the case where things are up against the wall, and I'm looking, the other thing, of course, they taught us is the highs and lows, what we call the fat tails, and things can get bad. So being realistic, but knowing that I have the power to do something about it, you have more power than you think.\n\nAdam: That's a great lesson, you have the freedom to take risks. At the end of the day, we control our destinies to a degree much greater than any of us realize. All too often, we get trapped in the moment. And we get trapped in the pressures and responsibilities of our day-to-day lives or day-to-day jobs or day-to-day responsibilities. But if you take a step back, your point is right on the money. It's your life, get in the driver's seat, you only have one life, it's yours. Take control. That That's right. How do you assess the companies that you invest in? And what are your best tips on the topic of investing?\n\nJenny: What's particularly interesting having done it over a long period and having a lot of fails, and then having a handful of really big successes and looking back and saying what do I regret or what am I proud of, people probably looked at me, they'd say I'd taken a lot of risk. And I probably would say I didn't take enough risk. And also the one other unique piece to who we are as a firm is that we're trading, we're in the market all the time. Most people are in their businesses unless there are financial businesses, a lot of them are in their retail market, whatever it is. But when you pay attention to the market which has been this glorious market for so many years until April 22, you have to know what the market and therefore ultimately the customer cares about. Where's the real demand today and into the next 5 to 10 years? You're thinking that AI would be the obvious one at the top of the list. If that's the case, then you're also looking at what are investors rewarding. Are they rewarding how many eyeballs you can get? Are they rewarding the bottom line? Those things make a difference in how you approach your business plan. Despite us being in the markets, we were naive in many ways, which is why I would say today, I probably would have taken a risk differently if I could go back and do it again. Where's the most bang for your buck? Whereas for all my time and effort, where is the upside? And being cognizant because there are two things I think that you toil with, especially as an entrepreneur, but what do you care passionately about? If you care about both those things together, or if you don't? Because if you do, you have to think about what the market is rewarding in that scope of time. We might talk about three to five years in from a trading world perspective, but it's more of a decade. What are we looking at in a 7 to 10-year timeframe? Where do we think the customer is gonna be? What are they going to care about? Where are investors looking to invest? And staying attuned to that really will help you make top-down decisions a little bit better. This is why I'd say, the world in the last decade was rewarding every effort under the sun, eyeballs, and making no money, whatever it was, and you can behave differently during those times. And I think coming from the trading world and risk-taking world, we always said we didn't make the most money. We've had a lot of success, but we don't lose money either. It actually could have been an opportunity to lose money which is a funny thing to say, at least to us and historically. But if you think about how many years Amazon did go and not make money, you take some of these bigger lessons that are out there and look at the totality of the market that you're going into. Now, if you're looking at a smaller business and it's a local business, you might wait that less. But if you're trying to build a substantial business, I think it's really important to understand what investors care about. Frankly, PEAK6 has always done this, we're looking for businesses that make money. And we will make bets because if they're strategic to us in some way, or we think we have a unique opportunity, and most of the things we invest, probably half in FinTech, which we have because of APEX FinTech solutions, it's the back end technology for almost 65% of the retail broker-dealers out there. So, we have a lot of knowledge. And so when you have knowledge about the industry, and you have all that data on all the customers, more than 25 million customers there, 100 million on the tax side, that informs the market. Again, it's informing us on that front. And then on the other side of the business where we look at a broader range, I do think we would have done things differently. That was also newish to us in the last 10 years, we didn't do a lot of that. We did a lot of fintech and then we started to spread our wings. But I don't think there's a one-size-fits-all-all. But I do think there's a really important lesson to think about top-down what the market is rewarding.\n\nAdam: What do you look for in the people who you invest in, whether you're investing in their companies, or whether you're entrusting them with responsibility as a member of your team?\n\nJenny: We've learned a lot over the years over having more than 15 different businesses. And for sure, in our leaders, we're looking for leaders who bring out the best in their best talent. So it's a little bit of a derivative, which is the world I live in. But where the best leader leads their ego, doesn't matter how the team succeeds, as long as they succeed. What happens is, as that organization gets better, there's going to be pockets of talent. And we want all of the best talent to succeed at the highest rate because they're all going to be a reflection of the person who is leading. And all of those people can then follow all of those pieces of best talent. So I've more leaders doing better things one step down from their primary leader. So we think about it more like partners, as opposed to a triangle of CEO on down. The other thing that we look for is those who are willing to be super self-aware is critical. And those who are willing to change, which means taking risks again, of course. But I'll give you an example, we might be in a turnaround situation and have the perfect person to do that. We call them a wartime general. But when things are turning, and getting better, and now we need that peacetime general and we need a growth person, it might not be the same person anymore. And people get locked into titles and it's great when they're taking accountability. But sometimes the accountability is to say, I'm the wrong person for that stage. So now what do I do? I'm gonna lean on my partners, hopefully, I'm gonna lean on somebody else. What does that mean about titles and all these other things? We're super flexible inside of our firm, and we like people who recognize that their best and highest use may not be in that same spot anymore. So we have a lot of fluidity across our firm. So one of the things we're most proud of is the talent that is at PEAK6 but also stays at PEAK6 for so many years. Because they get to grow and develop in different ways. And they get used in the best way possible for their specific skills.\n\nAdam: As you describe what you look for in leaders who you invest in, you mentioned a couple of really important characteristics, universal to the very best leaders. Self-awareness, flexibility, being willing to change. You also mentioned something really important, which doesn't get talked about enough. If the very best leaders understand when to step up and when to step back, you are never going to be the right person for every situation. Just not possible. What is the right situation for you? What is the right company for you to lead? What is the right time for you to lead? Are you the right person? Are you the wrong person? And it does come back to self-awareness. If you understand yourself intimately, understand your strengths, understand your weaknesses, and know thyself, that will guide you. That will allow you to know, should I step up? Should I step back? Your partner at peak six is also your husband. You were colleagues and then co-founders, and business partners before becoming spouses. What have been the keys to maintaining healthy personal relationships and a healthy professional relationship when the two are so deeply intertwined? And what advice do you have for listeners on how to develop and maintain successful relationships and partnerships?\n\nJenny: Yeah, that's dangerous. We have known each other very long time. And we were many years into PEAK6 before this happened. And nobody would have guessed. Because I always say there's a fine line between love and hate because starting a firm is hard. There's a lot of risk. And there's a lot of highs and lows. So the fact that this became something is funny because you find quite a few husbands and wives that are in it. Keys, one thing we did may or may not be unique, but we have different responsibilities. I always say you can't assume I know something just because I'm married. So initially, he was the outside person, and I was the inside person. He's a top-down person, I’m a bottom-up person, so we can divide and conquer the world. Of course, those things eventually merge and chaos ensues. But I also think especially at the time, we have to think back. This is 26 years ago. The fact that we were equal partners, when we started, is probably kudos to him, he's got a really strong mom and sister. And that's why he was open-minded. I also think, that because we had started that department inside of the bank together, so he knew. But we always said he or she who has the most passion wins, because it was just two votes. Self-awareness is critical because it can go into your personal life. The maturity and growing that maturity over the years takes a lot and then you put kids on top of it. I would not say it's for the faint of heart but extraordinarily rewarding if it works. I mean, it's like a job for us, it is our world. So we're really lucky to share the highs and lows, even though it can be traumatic at times.\n\nAdam: Given your experience cultivating this unique relationship, what advice do you have for listeners on how to develop and maintain successful relationships personally and professionally?\n\nJenny: I don't know if I'm the best person. But one thing I know that I didn't do in my early years and it's funny because I wouldn't take this back when I say he was the outside person, I was the inside person. I did nothing with the outside world, including networking. And I wouldn't take it back because it allowed me what I needed to do to be the mom I wanted to be. Because there was only so much time in a day. But I do know now since I've been aggressively out there in the last couple of years, how valuable building those relationships is. And so I would figure out how to reprioritize something so I could do that in the future. But you have to be precise because there's just limited time. So how can you do it? And the beauty of the flexible workplace allows for a lot more of that today than before. But I also think you have to be smart. I always say to the women who asked how I was able to do what I did. I say don't lock yourself in any certain way because you don't know what's going to change, particularly with your children. What do you have time for? So if I have time, if I want to do this for the next quarter, this amount of networking doesn't mean I have to do it the next quarter or the next quarter, but I might do it in the fourth quarter. It doesn't mean I have to do it for the whole year. I get to control what I'm going to do and what my priority is and priorities change. People don't change, though. And so what do you need to do to create the best relationships personally and professionally, besides being a good human, that takes effort and time so you can't do everything. But if you can get a two for one, I would take it.\n\nAdam: Jenny, what can anyone listening to this conversation do to become more successful personally and professionally?\n\nJenny: Everybody has their luck. You can be in the right place at the right time. I think the question is, how do you capitalize on it? And I will tell you, you have to take risks. It's the only way. People think it's like I had to jump out of a plane. Oh, I have to start a company. No, you don't have to. You have to take greater risks, you have to take more ‘risks’ with an S. So, those start to compound and you start to learn what you're good at, what kind of risks you like to take, and you have to start earlier, which is why the beauty of getting poker as an example, you can start teaching poker at 6, 7, 8 years old. When they see it when they're 12, and 14 again, and then when they see it when they're 18 and 20, they have all that under their belt. They're not learning from scratch. Same thing with any kind of risk you're going to take. So when somebody thinks you are the right person for a job, and you're not quite sure of that, don't think about how you feel, think about why they asked you. Why would they ask if they didn't think you were right? If I wait till I'm 97% sure, the person who was good to take a risk who's 60% sure, and typically, in our industry, it tends to be the male, I'm getting behind automatically. He's not any more certain than I am certain. He's just willing to take the risk. So for certain, I said yes without not knowing I could say no. So, I got lucky. But your conscious self, if you're not getting uncomfortable, which is what risk does, everybody wants their curve to go up into the right, personal money, whatever it is. But it's going to have a ceiling. If you don't take risks. The only way it gets higher and steeper is if you take the risk, and it has to go lower to go higher. And over time, those swings start to even out, you get better and better at doing it. But if you don't start and then you wait, you wait till I can't take any risk. Because now I've got three kids in the house and that thing, that's why we have to get our women and those identify as women earlier taking those risks.\n\nAdam: Jenny, thank you for all the great advice and thank you for being a part of Thirty Minute Mentors.\n\nJenny: My pleasure.

      "# [Wolves owners Fosun buy back minority stake from US investment firm by Steve Madeley on 2024-11-06](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5903216/2024/11/06/wolves-owners-fosun-minority-stake/)\nWolverhampton Wanderers owners Fosun has bought back a minority stake in its subsidiary, Fosun Sports, from US-based investment firm PEAK6.\n\nThe Chicago-based company bought a stake in Fosun Sports — which owns Wolves and several Wolves-related companies including esports brands, a record company and a clothing firm — three years ago.\n\nHowever, Fosun has now bought the shares back for around $50million (£38.92m; €46.69m).\n\nPEAK6 Investments, led by co-founders Jenny Just and Matt Hulsizer, owners a range of companies and previously held stakes in Premier League club Bournemouth and Italian Serie A side Roma.\n\nAnnouncing the initial sale in October 2021, a Wolves statement read: “The investment makes PEAK6 a new strategic partner to Wolves, who will help Fosun Sports accelerate the club’s growth in North America by providing capital, expertise, visibility, and activation opportunities for Wolves and Wolves Esports across the USA.”\n\nPEAK6 director John Makowiec also became a director of Wolves, but the partnership has now ended with Fosun regaining the shares.\n\nWhat does the deal mean for Wolves?\n\nEssentially, it returns Wolves to the pre-2021 status quo with Fosun Sports regaining the minority stake that it sold.\n\nIt could be viewed as a simple case of PEAK6 wanting to spend its money elsewhere and Fosun choosing to buy back the shares instead of seeing them sold to a third party.\n\nBut it could also be seen as a tidying up exercise with Fosun known to be looking for investment in the club.\n\nThe Athletic has been told by several sources with knowledge of football finance that third parties claiming to be working for Fosun have attempted to find buyers for Wolves, which has been owned by the Chinese conglomerate since 2016.\n\nFosun has always denied suggestions that it was courting a sale of Wolves, while acknowledging that all assets are theoretically for sale for the right price.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nWolves: Fosun, finances and an uncertain future\n\nHowever, in a recent interview with the Telegraph, Wolves executive chairman Jeff Shi confirmed that Fosun was in talks with potential minority investors.\n\nFosun has come in for increasing criticism from Wolves fans in recent years following the success of the early years of its reign, which brought promotion from the Championship to the Premier League, two successive seventh-placed finishes in the top flight, an FA Cup semi final and a Europa League quarter final.\n\nStadium improvements which were mooted early in Fosun’s ownership have also failed to materialise, leading to fans questioning Fosun’s ambition for further success.\n\nPEAK6’s investment was in Fosun Sports and not directly in Wolves, so ownership of the club is not directly affected, but Fosun Sports is effectively a company built around Wolves and associated brands.\n\n(Top image: MI News/NurPhoto via Getty Images)"
