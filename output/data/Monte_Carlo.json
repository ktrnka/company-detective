      "# [Delivering End-to-End Data Trust with Snowflake and Monte Carlo by Scott O'Leary on 2021-04-29](https://www.montecarlodata.com/blog-snowflake/)\nAs companies increasingly leverage data-driven insights to drive innovation and maintain their competitive edge, it’s important that this data is accurate and reliable. With Monte Carlo and Snowflake’s strategic partnership, teams can finally trust their data through end-to-end Data Observability and automated lineage of their entire data ecosystem, all the way down to field-level values.\n\nHas your CEO ever told you that the numbers in a report you showed her looked way off?\n\nHas a customer ever called out errors in your product’s dashboards?\n\nWhat about a rise in a field’s null rate that went unnoticed for days or weeks because there wasn’t a noticeable change in your KPIs?\n\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, you’re not alone. Data downtime, in other words, periods of time when data is missing, inaccurate, or otherwise erroneous, is an all-too-familiar reality for even the best data teams, costing them millions of dollars in wasted revenue and up to 50 percent of the data engineering team’s time that could otherwise be spent moving the needle for the business.\n\nTo help companies trust their data, Monte Carlo is excited to announce our partnership with Snowflake by bringing our automated Data Observability Platform to the Data Cloud. Data teams relying on Snowflake to derive critical insights about their business can now leverage the power of automated anomaly detection, monitoring, and end-to-end lineage to prevent bad data from affecting downstream consumers.\n\nAchieving reliable Snowflake pipelines with data observability\n\nThe Snowflake – Monte Carlo integration makes it easy for data organizations to identify, resolve, and prevent data downtime and data quality issues before they impact the business, giving companies confidence in the reliability of their data and the products they power.\n\nWith this partnership, Snowflake customers can now:\n\nAchieve end-to-end Data Observability without writing any code. Get end-to-end data observability for your Snowflake data pipelines with a 20-minute, no-code implementation process. Access out-of-the-box visibility into data Freshness, Volume, Distribution, Schema, and Lineage just by plugging Monte Carlo into your Data Cloud.\n\nKnow when data breaks, as soon as it happens. Monte Carlo continuously monitors your Snowflake assets and proactively alerts stakeholders to data issues. Monte Carlo’s machine learning-first approach gives data teams broad coverage for common data issues with minimal configuration, and business-context-specific checks layered on top ensure you’re covered at each stage of your data pipeline.\n\nFind the root cause of data quality issues, fast. Monte Carlo gives teams a single pane of glass to investigate data issues, drastically reducing time to resolution. By bringing all information and context for your pipelines into one place, teams spend less time firefighting data issues and more time improving the business.\n\nImmediately understand the business impact of bad data. End-to-end lineage for your pipelines from the point it enters Snowflake (or further upstream!) down to the analytics and business intelligence layer, data teams are able to assess the business impact of their data issues, ultimately preventing decision making based on bad data.\n\nPrevent data downtime. Give your teams full visibility into your Snowflake pipelines and how they impact downstream reports and dashboards to make more informed development decisions. With Monte Carlo, teams can better manage breaking changes to ELTs and BI assets by knowing what will be impacted and who to notify.\n\nIn addition to supporting existing mutual customers, Monte Carlo provides end-to-end, automated coverage for teams migrating from their legacy stacks to the Snowflake Data Cloud Platform. Moreover, Monte Carlo’s security-first approach to Data Observability ensures that data never leaves your Snowflake environment.\n\nWhat Monte Carlo and Snowflake customers have to say\n\nThe Zebra\n\nThe Zebra, a leading insurance comparison site, makes it easy for consumers across the United States to compare and save on car and home insurance quotes. The company provides over 1,800 car insurance products from more than 200 national insurers, a monumental feat that relies on real-time decision making powered by data from disparate third-party vendors and partners. The Zebra’s data team uses Snowflake and Monte Carlo to ensure that their data pipelines are performant and reliable.\n\n“As a data leader, there’s nothing worse than not being able to trust your data,” said Shea Spalding, Head of Data Governance at The Zebra. “The combination of Snowflake’s data cloud and Monte Carlo’s data observability platform helps ensure that our data is accessible and fresh at each stage of the data life cycle. With this stack, my team can better collaborate to resolve issues, work towards data trust, and build better products for our customers.”\n\nMindbody\n\nAs the world’s leading wellness services marketplace, Mindbody is a company with data at heart. Alex Soria, VP of Data & Analytics, is leading the charge with a team of over 25 data scientists, business intelligence analysts, and data engineers responsible for ensuring that the insights powering their product is fresh and reliable.\n\nAs the world’s leading wellness services marketplace, Mindbody is a company with data at heart. Alex Soria, VP of Data & Analytics, is leading the charge with a team of over 25 data scientists, business intelligence analysts, and data engineers responsible for ensuring that the insights powering their product is fresh and reliable.\n\n“Data-driven decision making is a huge priority for Mindbody, but our analytics are only as reliable as the data that informs them,” said Alex. “We are working with Monte Carlo to monitor and alert for abnormalities in our Snowflake pipelines, such as null values and duplicate data, that would otherwise go unnoticed until it’s too late. By partnering with Snowflake and Monte Carlo, my team can achieve more powerful analytics and full data reliability.”\n\nCollaborative Imaging\n\nCollaborative Imaging is a radiologist-owned alliance dedicated to improving the lives of physicians and patients everywhere through technology. With over 18,000 patients seen per day and nearly 1M radiological exams read per month, the alliance is charting a course for the future of this industry by giving providers the solutions and processes necessary to better serve their communities.\n\nTo power their business, Collaborative Imaging needs fast analytics powered by clean and reliable data, which is no easy feat given the size and scope of their distributed data ecosystem. To gain greater visibility into the health of their data at each stage of its life cycle, they needed a way to understand how data flows into their data warehouse, as well as be alerted when changes occur in schema or distribution of the many data sources which are ingested into their Snowflake data warehouse. Monte Carlo empowered them to troubleshoot and resolve issues before downstream data consumers are impacted.\n\n“Collaborative Imaging’s analytics platform helps physicians and patients connect the dots between disparate data points in their healthcare journey, but our insights are only as reliable as the data feeding our system. Dirty data is a landmark of healthcare analytics, and a lot of the work we do revolves around cleaning and making sense of this data to put it into one repository,” said Jacob. “Combined with Snowflake’s powerful Data Cloud and Monte Carlo’s Data Observability Platform, we can resolve these problems before they reach the business. My executives are happy and I can trust our data.”\n\nWant to learn more about how data observability can help you trust your data?

Where applicable, you may have the right to:\n\nRequest information about how we collect, process, use and share your Personal Information (commonly known as a “right to know request”).\n\nRequest access to your Personal Data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.\n\nRequest correction of the Personal Information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.\n\nRequest erasure of your Personal Information (commonly known as a “request to be forgotten”). This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Information. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your Personal Information to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply in full with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.\n\nObject to processing of your Personal Information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.\n\nRequest restriction of processing of your Personal Information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Information in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.\n\nRequest the transfer of your Personal Information to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.\n\nWithdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain Services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.\n\nIf you wish to exercise any of the above rights please contact privacy@montecarlodata.com.

      "# [Where The Data Silos Are by Shane Murray on 2022-11-01](https://www.montecarlodata.com/blog-data-silos/)\nSomething interesting happened the other day. Our company experienced a minor data incident that our data observability platform didn’t catch for the simple reason that the data was trapped in a silo.\n\nThis got me thinking about other places data hides, not just from data observability platforms, but from the scrutiny of the data team itself. We sometimes refer to these as data silos, but really it’s the data equivalent of shadow IT.\n\nShadow data (or, data silos) arise when:\n\nAutonomy and speed is prioritized over technical standards;\n\nData access or resources are limited, forcing teams to work around existing systems and processes; or\n\nData consumers decide to deploy their own point-solutions rather than work with you.\n\nBut instead of waving the white flag, consumers often find a way to get what they need outside of the watchful eye of the data team – and that’s risky.\n\nData silos present numerous risks to data consumers and the data team alike, such as:\n\nFragility: I’d wager John on the finance analytics team doesn’t have systems like dependency management and anomaly detection in place for his data set. And when executives come to you to ask why this metric is wrong, it’s going to be hard to debug when you don’t have any idea how it’s produced. Either way this creates a risk that valuable business data may be lost.\n\nKnowledge loss: If a data “power user” leaves, you don’t want to have to figure out how to reverse engineer their esoteric system you have now inherited. Not only will this be a poor allocation of resources, but their system may create untold headaches before it’s discovered as an issue (one company saw millions in revenue impacted when one of their predictive algorithms was discovered to be running on autopilot following the departure of a team member).\n\nSecurity: “I didn’t know about it!” won’t prevent regulators from handing down a fine for improper handling of personal data. For GDPR, that fine can be up to 4% of the company’s revenue–ouch.\n\nSpotty Access: Analysts get grumpy, and rightly so, when they can’t get access to what they need because it can’t be joined to their canonical user tables. These data silos create either opacity or the need to duplicate processes–neither of which is a positive outcome.\n\nBlinkered decisions: While data consumers can move quickly with user-friendly point solutions, for complex decisions they may need an expert to think through experiment design, sampling bias and confounding factors. An entire department could be circling the wagons and marching towards a goal that won’t fundamentally add value to the business or that’s being measured in an arbitrary fashion.\n\nSo how can data teams identify the data silos that lurk in the shadows? Can they use it as an opportunity to spot weaknesses within their data platform and bring consumers into the fold, either by encouragement or force?\n\nIn my opinion, the answer is yes. Let’s take a look at where the data silos are and how to break them.\n\nData Silo #1: Transformations and Pre-aggregations\n\nBut before we talk about data consumers, let’s not let ourselves as data professionals completely off the hook. We create our fair share of data silos in our quixotic attempt to meet the ever increasing demand for data while working within the realities of our team’s capacity.\n\nThe data incident we experienced the other day was a result of adding DataDog to our tech stack which introduced some tracing information into the data structures flowing into our application. And yes, believe me, I’m aware of the irony here.\n\nWhen that data was persisted into S3 and then ingested into Databricks, it was only partially loaded so our pipelines had missing data.\n\nOur post mortem concluded that our Spark jobs were overly complex with too many transformations. What we should have done as a best practice is to break the job up into a series of smaller transformations at key checkpoints that wrote to tables that could be monitored, which would have triggered a Monte Carlo volume alert.\n\nI’ve seen a similar scenario when dealing with old-school ETL and business intelligence implementations. Data was pre-aggregated for performance and the underlying layers were invisible to an analyst responsible for diagnosing surreptitious declines in key metrics. The analyst was lucky if they knew how the underlying data was transformed, let alone able to successfully find the cause of decline.\n\nSome of this behavior shifted with the move from ETL to ELT. Now, these days, you are more likely to see data teams establish best practices around breaking up transformations into clear steps (e.g. events => sessions => users => campaigns) rather than writing three pages of SQL that only the owner can decipher.\n\nWhile business intelligence tools will tout their data prep capabilities, this can wind up turning into another silo of business logic unavailable to teams outside of the tool. Clearly there are some benefits to last-mile manipulation and maybe rules like “no more than SELECT*” within BI are too draconian, but any reusable semantics must be widely available to your team.\n\nSolution: Break up complex transformations or SQL queries into distinct checkpoints that write out to tables that are monitored for data quality. Ensure your business logic isn’t locked into a single tool only accessible to part of your user base.\n\nData Silo #2: Spreadsheets\n\nSpreadsheets remain the most successful way to democratize data in many organizations, even if they may be an occasional source of pain and derision for data teams.\n\nOur partners in the finance department can do remarkable things with a PC and a VLOOKUP, and in my experience there are few better ways to democratize the prototyping of new data than by dropping a table into Google Sheets and collaborating with partners to manually append tags that are meaningful attributes for them to see in analysis.\n\nA spreadsheet becomes a data silo when it moves from prototype to production.Or in other words, if you see the same spreadsheet playing a role in a business operation more than once, it’s time to move the logic upstream and create something more systemic.\n\nSolution: A hack for data teams is to periodically review the mammoth spreadsheets that are being used to guide the business or may be sitting in a shared drive, spreadsheets that likely have some gnarly formulas or macros sitting on top of data that’s supplied by your team according to their specifications.\n\nThis review will often reveal ways to address gaps in your data platform and can help you bring transformations upstream to increase observability and scalability. You may even unlock new opportunities to standardize metrics such as lifetime value (LTV) for wider application and produce them at a far more granular level.\n\nData Silo #3: The “all-in-one” solution – ESP, CDP, DMP, A/B\n\nWhen done wrong, these can be the hardest silos to reign in.\n\nMuch of the marketing tech stack, like email service providers and marketing automation platforms, rose to prominence ahead of the advances in modern data warehouses. This meant the most expedient way to drive impact was with an all-in-one solution that collected, managed and served data directly to the marketer. Admittedly, I was once selling the dream of a “single line of javascript” for running experiments that allows you to avoid any further conversations with “IT.”\n\nSome of the most pressing problems created by this silo are that these systems quickly experience an ungoverned sprawl of customer segments (product page repeat visitors oct 2020) and the segmented campaigns often suffer from lack of measurement.\n\nBack in my consulting days I assessed that one large telco was “micro-targeting” less than 1% of their customer base because they were unknowingly filtering campaigns down to customers that satisfied every attribute within their complex segmentation.\n\nBut we turned a corner a few years ago – data teams and technologies are now capable of being fast and flexible enough to operate at the speed-of-business while also unlocking new opportunities with the richness of data in the warehouse (“hey, want to optimize for LTV instead of click-through?”). Marketers and other business partners see the value in going through, rather than around, the data team.\n\nThese marketer-first solutions are adapting. Whether you opt for a modern CDP or reverse ETL to transport data into the hands of marketers, the must-have feature is to have collection, transformation and basic segmentation operating on your enterprise data warehouse.\n\nSolution: I’ve found the best way to get marketing teams onboard is to create systems that respect and address their need for speed and autonomy, while partnering to ensure strong governance and measurement are part of the solution.\n\nMy recommendation? Proactively remove silos\n\nIt can be tempting to let sleeping dogs lie but, in my opinion, data teams should proactively work to remove data silos or any “shadow data” systems.\n\nI’ve typically opted for the Field of Dreams approach – “if you build it, they will come.” (The approach is probably more akin to gather requirements, scope the project, get approvals, build a minimum viable product, get feedback, iterate and they will come–but that is not nearly as pithy).\n\nBut if you build it and they don’t come, then you need to address whether that’s a failure of your technology solution, a lack of organizational buy-in, or something else altogether. Then you need to find a solution that puts you on the right path to breaking down silos.\n\nAfter all, data is ultimately the data team’s responsibility, and consumers will do what they need to do to access it. Our best path forward as data leaders is to accept this reality and take steps to mitigate it.\n\n-shane murray\n\nInterested in discussing your data reliability strategy?

Read on to learn more about our new integration.\n\nUnderstand business impact\n\nCritical to a complete data observability solution is the ability to understand the impact of downstream analytics and business teams when a data incident or anomaly occurs.\n\nMonte Carlo has enabled data engineering teams to assess business impact by automatically building lineage. With lineage, data teams are able to quickly understand relationships between tables, views, and BI dashboards, including upstream sources and downstream dependencies.\n\nTo date, Monte Carlo has enabled data teams to understand impacted BI users and dashboards for Looker, Tableau, Sisense, and more (see our complete list of integrations), and we are thrilled to help organizations that have deployed Microsoft Power BI to build greater data trust among their business stakeholders, analytics teams, and executives. With lineage, Monte Carlo equips data engineering teams with two core capabilities to ensure BI dashboard integrity: (1) triaging incidents when bad data strikes, and (2) proactively ensuring dashboards are up-to-date and reliable when making schema changes or migrating tools.\n\nTriage data incidents\n\nWith automated lineage, data engineering teams can immediately understand the downstream impact of data incidents and anomalies when they occur.\n\nOnce the data team receives an alert from Monte Carlo that an incident has occurred in Microsoft Teams, Slack, PagerDuty, or other collaboration tools, they can click through to the incident. One of the first insights they’ll see is Impact Radius, which includes the number of tables that experienced a similar incident or anomaly, as well as potentially impacted data warehouse or lake users and dependent queries. Now, Impact Radius also includes potentially impacted Microsoft Power BI users, reports, and dashboards.\n\nBy parsing query logs and analyzing metadata from Power BI, Monte Carlo is able to automatically build lineage between data warehouse tables and views, and Power BI reports, as well as enable data engineering teams to quickly evaluate impacted Power BI users and reports when data incidents occur.\n\nAfter evaluating the impact of the data incident, the data engineer responding to it can quickly assign an owner, severity level, and incident status, such as, “investigating,” within Monte Carlo and have the updates visible for Power BI users in Microsoft Teams, or the collaboration tool of choice for the organization.\n\nPlan schema changes and migrations\n\nAnother common use case and capability for data teams and organizations using Microsoft Power BI includes the ability to assess potential impact to Power BI dashboards and reports prior to making a field, table, or schema change, and even when migrating to new cloud data warehouses or to Power BI itself.\n\nWith lineage, data teams can quickly view BI reports that could be impacted prior to making a schema change or when migrating tables to a new cloud data warehouse. In the example below of Monte Carlo’s Catalog page, we can see that a change to the subscription table, if done incorrectly, could impact a number of Power BI reports, Tableau workbooks, and Looker dashboards.\n\n“Not every data incident is created equal. Some data anomalies can occur and not impact a thing; whereas another incident may impact a critical business intelligence dashboard that your CFO uses daily. With Monte Carlo’s Power BI integration, data teams can now triage data incidents and ensure they resolve data anomalies before they impact the business,” said Lior Gavish, CTO, Monte Carlo. “We couldn’t be more excited to support more organizations and accelerate the adoption of reliable data and analytics with data observability.” ”\n\nWith this new integration, mutual customers can quickly understand the business impact of data anomalies, properly triage data incidents when they occur, and proactively ensure data reliability when making schema changes or even migrating to new cloud warehouses or Power BI.\n\nWhat our customers have to say\n\nMonte Carlo and Microsoft Power BI customers like Shiftkey, a leading technology platform bringing critical workforce solutions, and Spark NZ, a New Zealand telecommunications company, are excited to leverage the new Power BI integration to improve data reliability and build data trust across their organizations.\n\n“With Monte Carlo, we know our data is reliable and trustworthy,” said John Steinmetz, VP of Data & Analytics, Shiftkey. “Their Power BI integration signifies a commitment to providing even greater visibility into downstream dashboards and reports, providing an even more holistic picture of data health. I’m excited about the potential of this impactful milestone for data observability.”\n\n“At Spark NZ, reliable data is critical to our mission of helping all of New Zealand win big in a digital world. With Monte Carlo, we can ensure that the data powering decision making and digital services is accurate, fresh, and trustworthy – in other words, reliable” said Gary Phillips, Domain Chapter Lead, Analytics and Visualization at Spark New Zealand. “With their new Power BI integration, we have confidence that the source data feeding our reports and dashboards meets stakeholder expectations, and that we’re quick to root cause and resolve incidents if they occur. We’re excited to leverage the increased visibility and end-to-end coverage afforded by their data observability platform and this new capability.”\n\nIf you are a current Monte Carlo customer and are interested in setting up the Power BI integration, please contact your customer success manager.\n\nWant to learn more about our latest integration with Microsoft Power BI?

I really recommend these lectures. He's a fantastic teacher. This is his current semester, so it's not yet complete. Previous years' courses are also available if you outpace his output. \n\nMC methods are surprisingly powerful for how simple they are, conceptually. Firstly, they can replace the ocean of test statistics that you have to grapple with using frequentist methods. With a single process you can do pretty much any hypothesis test without basing the overall assessment of the hypothesis on an arbitrary cutoff point like alpha=5%.\n\nYou can incorporate domain knowledge in your models. If, for example, you know that a parameter *has* to be positive (because it's a count of some real world thing) and also should probably be somewhere between 5 and 10, and is very unlikely to be 10,000 you can include this in your model even if you don't have any data for it.\n\nMC methods also let you design relationships between variables, let you get information about unobserved quantities that either affect or are affected by observed quantities, can be used as part of a causal analysis, can give you a tool for simulating a contra-positive (what would have happened otherwise), can give you highly explainable results, can work on smaller data sets, can give you not only point estimates but credible intervals (which are much more intuitive to non-technical people than confidence intervals are).\n\n### Comment ID j5ztk8k with +1 score by [(Coco_Dirichlet, Reddit, 2023-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10ljew2/monte_carlo_simulation/j5ztk8k/) (in reply to ID j5yyfh4):\nMCMC is not the same as MC\n\n## Comment ID j5ylvf6 with +3 score by [(OneSprinkles6720, Reddit, 2023-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10ljew2/monte_carlo_simulation/j5ylvf6/) (in reply to ID 10ljew2):\nMonte carlo gives me guidelines I can use to yank a financial markets trading algo out of production.

This is a high level description but hopefully you get the idea of what the use case was.\n\n## Comment ID j6001fc with +1 score by [(Coco_Dirichlet, Reddit, 2023-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10ljew2/monte_carlo_simulation/j6001fc/) (in reply to ID 10ljew2):\nThe simplest reason to use Monte Carlo simulation is that you fit a model (e.g. logistic regression) and you want to calculate predictions for a range of values of one of the variables. How do you calculate the uncertainty for those predictions/predicted probabilities? Well, the easiest way to go about it is by doing MC simulation because in non-linear models, the uncertainty for each prediction is going to change for each value of X.\n\nYou can also use Monte Carlo simulations for cross-validation.\n\nYou can also use Monte Carlo simulations when you are comparing a series of different models performance, on average, with a lot of data you simulated (fake data) that has a particular problem (e.g. heteroskedastic data, or serially correlated data).\n\nAnd can people in the comments spot implying MCMC is the same as MC. It's not! MCMC includes an MC, but OP asked about MC. They aren't used for the same problems. If you take a Bayesian Stats course, you'll cover MCMC but MC is just going to be a tiny part of the course.  \n\nThere are several books that are *only* on Monte Carlo simulations. I have several I got for courses I took in grad school. If you want to learn about it, getting an applied book that's specifically about it is useful.\n\nI don't know what people are talking about on Twitter. Twitter is shit. That said, in general courses don't focus a lot on the presentation of results/prediction/visualization/explanation, and MC is used a lot on that area. Books usually stop once you fit the model, maybe have some basic table, a one summary explanation of the results (and it's usually something like this goes up, this goes down), the end.\n\n### Comment ID j61k284 with +1 score by [(MrAce2C, Reddit, 2023-01-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10ljew2/monte_carlo_simulation/j61k284/) (in reply to ID j6001fc):\nHi!

For example, computing the price of a path dependent option using a nontrivial (í.e. something more advanced than black scholes) model for the underlying asset means you are probably looking at an sde which has no known closed form solution for the pdf, so how will you compute the risk neutral expectation of the payoff function (meaning the price of the option)?

If a) annual recurring revenue hits $1,000,000 the next, and b) expenses are less than $600,000, then a payment of $500,000 is made. The payment itself is the formula running through the 10,000 iterations; however, it isn't as simple as \"if annual recurring revenue minus expenses is greater than $400,000, then the payment is $500,000.\" \n\nFirst, annual recurring revenue is a \"point in time\" figure of what will be expected going forward based on contracts in place today whereas expenses reflect actual historical operations. Second, and more important, if either metric is not achieved, no payment is made. Annual recurring revenue could be $1,300,000 and expenses could be $800,000, for example, which would mean no payment is due even though the difference between the two metrics is beyond the target difference.\n\nI modeled out the payout scenarios fine, but when I get to actually running a metric through Geometric Brownian Motion, I realize there is no one metric to run through. I referenced the [VFR Valuation Advisory #4 Valuation of Contingent Consideration](https://appraisalfoundation.sharefile.com/share/view/s89a36f672e344eeb) guidance, but it does not quantify an example provided regarding revenue and EBITDA hurdles being achieved (on page 17). \n\nHas anyone had any luck running this type of modeling? \n\n## Comment ID kilv7gd with +3 score by [(TheHuskyFluff, Reddit, 2024-01-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialmodelling/comments/19altie/monte_carlo_with_two_separate_forecast_metrics/kilv7gd/) (in reply to ID 19altie):\nWhy not an AND formula for both conditions?

This is going to require an assumption of fixed vs. variable costs. So my path forward would be to model the variable costs in line with the revenue simulation and assume that the fixed costs are well, fixed. The assumption within fixed costs is effectively that they’d be discounted at the risk-free rate or cost of debt, and wouldn’t be subject to a fixed cost volatility that you’d see in a revenue or EBITDA metric for example.\n\nI also think that once you determine the balance of fixed costs vs. variable costs, this may simplify to the use of digital options instead of an MCS. For example, the maximum revenue that would earn the payment without going over would be = ($600,000 – Fixed Costs) ÷ Variable Costs as a % of Revenue. To use proxy numbers, if fixed costs were $250k and variable costs were 30% of revenue, then $1.167m in revenue would yield $600k in expenses, and anymore revenue would yield zero payment. So there is zero payment with revenue below $1m, a payment of $500k if revenue hits $1m, and a reduction in the payment of $500k if revenue hits $1.167m in revenue. I think you could use an MCS to check, but a digital option on a risk neutral revenue metric with a payment at $500k at $1m in revenue and -$500k (clawback)at $1.167m in that case should do the trick or get close.\n\n### Comment ID kirzav3 with +1 score by [(AccountingOnYa, Reddit, 2024-01-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialmodelling/comments/19altie/monte_carlo_with_two_separate_forecast_metrics/kirzav3/) (in reply to ID kio4i7m):\nThanks for the response!

That's usually in conjunction with a user story mapping process (Jeff Patton), and harks back to how Extreme Programming (XP) worked.   \n  \nAs soon as access to the customer becomes a constraint, you'll tend to slide towards larger \"batch sizes\" and the need for more \"upstream\" product discovery and \"downstream\" UAT and feedback.  \n  \nIn those cases you tend to move from the \"thin slice of value\" model and decompose the \"big\" work into things that are more work-flow or task oriented, based on the \"up front requirements\"   \n  \nIt's not super agile, because the big batch sizes will still tend to mean an \"inspect and rework\" approach to quality (in a \"built the right thing\" sense)   \n  \nHowever it's also not really waterfall, as you will still be doing all the agile \"build the thing right\" stuff around CI/CD, automated testing, agile test quadrants and even stuff like TDD and pairing.\n\nThat said, I'd counsel it's really down to the team in terms of how they want to self-manage the work.  The data they are tracking should help them to locate bottlenecks and continuously improve how they are delivering.  \n  \nIt's also up to the business how they want to control investment risk.

MC simulation achieved better results.\n* One of the most subtle, but best things about moving to something like MC simulation is the introduction of probability into forecasts. You no longer communicate: \"Yeah, we'll be done on Feb 30. We think.\" and move to \"We'll be finished on Feb 30, x% of the time\" where x is your risk tolerance.\n* A lot of people make a big deal about sample set. I found that 10 pieces of cycle time/throughput data was sufficient to start generating results.\n* While small, same sized stories can help, I found you can still use MC simulation without working on story size. What a backlog with same sized stories will do is \"narrow\" the distribution curve of throughput results, which will reduce the impact of risk levels on the forecast. Forecasts with randomly sized stories are still valid, but changes in risk tolerance will produce a wider range of results.\n* Some semblance of control over cycle time, and thus throughput, is more important than story size, imo. But you really shouldn't be saying you're using kanban if you're not controlling WIP.\n* You'll need to prune your data set. Obvious outliers should be thrown away. You probably want a horizon for the data so you're biased towards more recent results. And, of course, fundamental changes to critical things like team composition, etc can render previous forecasts unreliable.\n\n### Comment ID lkk3skz with +3 score by [(mippzon, Reddit, 2024-08-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/agile/comments/1f4akow/you_experience_with_monte_carlo_simulation_in/lkk3skz/) (in reply to ID lkjzn6p):\nThanks for an extensive answer!

I believe it might be a plugin for Jira now??\n* Even with expert Kanban teams, you might find yourself with a story/ticket that gets put on hold due to some emergency, or because someone is sick and there's no one to pick it up, or life just generally intervenes. For example, a ticket might get started before Christmas, just not get finished before the break, and sit there until the new year. Yeah, with enough brain sweat we could have probably come up with a good enough adjusted cycle time, but we just didn't want to bother. One of the things we wanted from the MC approach was just less handling of stories. \n* I'm not sure what you're asking for in terms of variance. Do you mean what's the farthest we've missed a forecast? Or how much the forecast varies based on risk? \n   * If it's the latter, then yeah, some of our forecasts generated with small data sets had great sensitivity to risk level. That's the one advantage of a larger data set and/or smaller stories. \n   * If it's the former, we tended to set quarterly releases to customers, so we'd use a \"How many\" simulation to tell the PO how many stories they could reasonably pick from the product backlog.

As an example, consider the case when you have some data whose generation you are unaware of. You don't know how to start to fathom how it is distributed.\n\nNow, suppose I ask you to evaluate a confidence interval for some outcome on this sample. How would you do it?\n\nYou don't have a table for this distribution. You don't have a functional form. You might start to panic... But not to worry. Monte Carlo methods (and the bootstrap, for example) would be one way to go about evaluating confidence intervals.\n\nAnother example would be when you have a model which is high-dimensional. Grid methods or tables or otherwise might be out of the question, but Monte Carlo estimates have errors that don't scale as a function of dimension, but rather the (inverse square root of) number of samples.\n\nThere are many kinds of MC methods and many different uses in general.

You own a manufacturing firm that makes widgets. Your widgets come in three forms, and that is dependent upon which components go into your widgets. So you aren't sure how many of A, B, and C components to make for your customizable widgets. And you know that ultimately, you need to make components ahead of time for each of your widgets that you hope to sell.\n\nYou also have firms you sell to. Let's say you have 300 distributors, and you have records of how much they've bought from you in the past. This might include that distributor 1 buys between 10 and 50 a month of widget A, 20-40 of widget B, 10-130 of widget C, etc. and repeat for all of the distributors that you have.\n\nSo now you have a bunch of data from your distributors and a bunch of data about your own widgets. You have a computer run a Monte Carlo simulation - this simulation kind of randomly picks (within a known distribution, which you built given your historical data) how many of each type of widget each distributor will purchase from you each month. Maybe it guesses 37 A widgets, 29 B widgets, and 114 C widgets to your first distributor this month. Now repeat that process for each distributor for the month. Now you have a somewhat educated, but still kind of random, guess for how many of each widget component you might need to make.\n\nBut because statistics is cool, you can tell this computer to run this simulation 100,000 times for each distributor for each month. At the end of the entire simulation, you now have distributions of how many components of each type you'd need to make all the widgets you would likely need (given that historical trends, representing the historical distributions , continue).\n\nThat's a really, really simple Monte Carlo simulation.\n\nAnd once you do that with Bayesian statistics on top of it then you are near a Markov Chain. That's the point at which you're probably crying and just want it to go away.\n\n#### Comment ID hwy16h0 with +4 score by [(it_is_Karo, Reddit, 2022-02-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ssfgto/the_monte_carlo_algorithm/hwy16h0/) (in reply to ID hwy0nee):\nI used it with linear programming to maximize profits and find optimal quantities of each product to be manufactured but there's a long YT video about that:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C826fYLPnA\n\n## Comment ID hwxouyb with +2 score by [(ds_account_, Reddit, 2022-02-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ssfgto/the_monte_carlo_algorithm/hwxouyb/) (in reply to ID ssfgto):\nOnly time I’ve seen it used in practice was for simulation of network traffic.\n\nBut I have used Gibbs sampling and seen it used in a number of applications.

I think you need to frame the method in knowing that a huge part of the practical application of mathematics before the 20th century involved manually computing different functions. \n\nHuge reference works of tables were produced of sines and cosines of different angles and the digits of pi to offload computation time for precise calculations. Some mathematicians spent years creating these kinds of tables. It's been argued that some of Newton's discoveries were the probable result of him seeing patterns in the huge numbers of manual computations that he used to do. Yes, even 'serious' people like Newton did this kind of thing.\n\nConceptually, an abacus is analogous to a computer. It's just offloading computation onto a physical process. Disregarding the technical breakthroughs of the transistor and the miniaturization of electronics, a computer is, conceptually, just finding a way to have calculations be done by the universe, through moving electrons around, rather than doing them by hand on a piece of paper. However, just by doing this very simple thing more quickly you are able to create entirely new fields, like computer graphics, that would be unthinkable in a paradigm where calculations have to be done by hand.\n\nSimilarly, the realization that: \"all of these problems that we can't solve analytically, I think we can solve them numerically by setting up a situation where a device will just 'spit out the correct answer'\" was pretty brilliant. Sure, this idea is somewhat obvious once advanced computers are established as an existing thing, but Ulam invented the method in the infancy of computers. Before computers, this kind of approach would have been unthinkable. If your issue is that \"Ulam shouldn't get so much credit because anyone could have come up with the idea once computers became established\" then maybe you're correct. But disregarding the question of credit and just considering the method itself, doesn't it almost send chills down your spine that we can just set up a system correctly and then have it give us the answer to a question that we would have no way of finding out the answer to on our own?\n\n### Comment ID kppannf with +45 score by [(rhubarb_man, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kppannf/) (in reply to ID kpp8ns6):\nI see, thank you.

For example, maybe you want to calculate the integral of a function over a line segment. \n\nOne way of doing this is by using Riemann sums over a grid of  k points on the line segment. Here you would need to evaluate your function k times over the grid. In n dimensions, the same idea would require k\\^n evaluations, so exponentially many in terms of the ambient dimension. \n\nAlternatively, if you can relate the integral to the density of random variable which is easy to sample from, you can save yourself some computational complexity by sampling from the density and using the strong law of large numbers. \n\n[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKnjsqYVG4Y) is an illustrative example I found.\n\n## Comment ID kpp28ga with +6 score by [(jdorje, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kpp28ga/) (in reply to ID 1amy1gh):\nWhat's \"interesting\" about Monte Carlo is that you can apply it to just about anything without knowing any/much deeper (real-world/science) theory or using deep math.    With just a bit of computing power you can get a long way without any real understanding of what you're studying.  It can be a great starting point for approaching a problem.\n\n\nThere is one advantage it may never lose in that its space complexity  is tiny, effectively constant.  While its time complexity is huge, typically exponential, it does lend itself to distributed or ongoing study.  \n\n\nYou can often use more interesting math and problem understanding to get \"better\" MC methods (like flipping toothpicks to approximate pi) or to get an error estimate out of your MC results (getting error bars on your pi toothpick estimate).  But it seems fairly rare that this is better than finding a non-MC solution (this is one of the worst possible ways to approximate pi).\n\n\nIf a better method is available it's usually going to be much better.

Some of these stunning applications come in theory CS, particularly in counting or sampling from a set of combinatorial structures. The MCMC method runs riot here.\n\nOne example which I have directly worked on is the uniform sampling of proper colorings of a graph. Note that the set of all colorings, proper and improper, with k colors of a graph with n vertices is exponentially large. What you want to do however is produce a uniform sample from the set of proper colorings, i.e., colorings which impart two different colors across any edge of the graph. This set is exponentially smaller than the set of all colorings, and it is unstructured. So we have absolutely no clue how to produce a uniform sample from this set other than the Monte Carlo method. \n\nAnother interesting example is sampling independent sets of a graph. Note that usually this is a very hard problem. However, using the MCMC method we discovered that there is a range of parameters for which this sampling is easy, and beyond a certain threshold suddenly becomes hard in the NP hard sense. It turns out this threshold is related to the physics of phase transitions of certain models of magnetism! \n\nOther places where deep insights have been gleaned from this technique is the theory of expanders  which finds use in everything from modelling large networks to error correcting codes. \n\nThere are literally reams of literature dedicated to this line of work in theory CS, each more surprising than the last. \n\nI hope this answer helps somewhat.\n\n## Comment ID kpoxxzt with +3 score by [(CatOfGrey, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kpoxxzt/) (in reply to ID 1amy1gh):\nWhat makes Monte Carlo interesting for me, is that it can be used to model outcomes based on non-standard distributions.\n\nIn my practice, I have done Monte Carlo work with survey data.

If we precisely knew, or at least the equations of, every possible chemical reactions down to the most granular level of matter, then we can predict everything in theory. \n\nBut even then just knowing the equation does not give the formula for the solutions, let alone existence directly. All the deterministic methods we have, i.e., numerical methods, usually require us to know enough about the equation to make reasonable approximations. However, when we do not even know the equations and all we have is just observations, then the Monte Carlo methods can help us. \n\nIt's not clear from the simple coin toss example but it's evident when you learn just a little bit of Reinforcement Learning. The big breakthrough that RL brought us in the field of AI stuff like beating Chess, Go, Starcraft, Dota, or Protein folding, self-driving cars are all founded on that simple idea of *repeatedly sampling from your environment* until you learn enough. Note that I am entirely discarding more traditional areas like numerical integration, but that's not to mean MC was not helpful there. \n\nIt's a bit simplistic but if we take the existence or invention of computers granted, then we owe much of modern scientific advances on modern AI to that silly little idea of \"flipping a coin bunch of times.\"\n\n## Comment ID kpr8q61 with +1 score by [(512165381, Reddit, 2024-02-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kpr8q61/) (in reply to ID 1amy1gh):\nApplications\n\n- it can be used in calculus https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_integration\n\n- it IS used in quantitative finance https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_methods_in_finance\n\n- it IS used in pricing financial options https://blog.skz.dev/monte-carlo-options-pricing\n\n> Have people not been doing it for millennia?\n\nProbably, but now we do it via computer.\n\n## Comment ID kprbudd with +1 score by [(gutshog, Reddit, 2024-02-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kprbudd/) (in reply to ID 1amy1gh):\nthis math not mathmemes\n\n## Comment ID kprkejh with +1 score by [(tpn86, Reddit, 2024-02-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kprkejh/) (in reply to ID 1amy1gh):\nThe price of a financial asset is an expectation.

It's  almost like asking \"what is the usefulness of computers\". Any answer shorter than 100 books would borderline feel superficial. \n\nMCMC, specifically, allowed us to to reason on very high dimensional spaces. That's it? That's it. One thing is to write some homeomorphisms between two different spaces (which is also beautiful). Another thing is to be able to reason in such spaces and rigorously materialize/compute estimates. DNA sequencing? Check. Properties of light-year away galaxies? Check. Estimating the stress over the wing of an aerospace vehicle? Check..check..check.\n\n## Comment ID kps89vf with +1 score by [(reddisaurus, Reddit, 2024-02-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kps89vf/) (in reply to ID 1amy1gh):\nMCMC allows us to sample a distribution of functions for which we have absolutely no idea of any analytic representation. How is it not interesting to evaluate a function with no known mathematical representation?",

Sometimes it is low effort. Sometimes, there is no advisor. Some other times, on top of \"no advisor\", you have people who went through undergrad, and grad school, yet their institution has no classes or idea on how to prepare them to do research. All assignments and exams become a regurgitation of information. There are no complex reasoning questions, or small research projects. Even if you take a basic English 101, you learn that if you have your essay, you better have sources too. Yet, somehow these institutions expect them to suddenly write a thesis.\n\n#### Comment ID kwcmxdt with +4 score by [(OneLargeMulligatawny, Reddit, 2024-03-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalPhysics/comments/1bls1iz/looking_for_guidance_for_monte_carlo_simulation/kwcmxdt/) (in reply to ID kwcksi8):\nTotally understand your viewpoint. But if that’s the case, choose a topic that is supported by the dept. When I was entering grad school, I had my perfect research idea in mind. Then I found that no professors did any in that specific area, so I pivoted. It seems people make things harder than necessary by being unwilling to make a change.\n\n## Comment ID kw75ur7 with +17 score by [(GotThoseJukes, Reddit, 2024-03-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalPhysics/comments/1bls1iz/looking_for_guidance_for_monte_carlo_simulation/kw75ur7/) (in reply to ID 1bls1iz):\nDo you have an advisor for this? \n\nI’m not trying to sound rude or unhelpful but you should talk to them before you ask questions here.

Juste create a simple simulation to compute dose in a volume ? Or do you want to simulate the whole setup from a clinical machine and compare it to TPS ? \n\nBoth things comes under your subject but the objectives are very different. \n\nOnce you have defined the thesis objective, the plan should come by itself \n\nThen you should think about using the right tools : GEANT4 is a awesome sandbox to make simulation  of particles transport but it’s very complicated to handle. \n\nThere are GEANT4 wrappers such as GATE or TOPAS that has been designed for medical and dosimetric applications with a script oriented langage way easier than GEANT4 object oriented C++ code.\n\n### Comment ID kw7pfgm with +1 score by [(hadjhabibmebarak, Reddit, 2024-03-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalPhysics/comments/1bls1iz/looking_for_guidance_for_monte_carlo_simulation/kw7pfgm/) (in reply to ID kw7i1ol):\nWhat is best and easiest GATE or TOPAS ?\n The university laboratory uses GATE\n\n#### Comment ID kw89wxt with +3 score by [(STDVRockbell, Reddit, 2024-03-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalPhysics/comments/1bls1iz/looking_for_guidance_for_monte_carlo_simulation/kw89wxt/) (in reply to ID kw7pfgm):\nI never used TOPAS.

If you have someone that can help you with one of the wrappers that's great, but even pure geant4 with root or csv output isn't too hard.\n\nI'd recommend you do your simulation in geant4 but keep everything after in python. If you use root files uproot is much friendlier than pyroot. Also I'd suggest using a conda environment to install everything - makes life a lot easier.\n\nGenerally the structure would be\n1. Here is a thing I'm interested in\n2. Here is why I can't compute it analytically\n3. Here is why Monte Carlo works for this\n4. What is geant4\n5. What did I simulate exactly?\n6.

Honestly can't think of much stuff that'd need to be done in Geant4 and not in one of those toolkits with some custom extensions.\n\n## Comment ID kwbi363 with +2 score by [(womerah, Reddit, 2024-03-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalPhysics/comments/1bls1iz/looking_for_guidance_for_monte_carlo_simulation/kwbi363/) (in reply to ID 1bls1iz):\nIt's very important you get the physics right in your simulation. Not just EM physics, but also check any hadronic stuff etc. Same goes for particle range cuts etc. Seen a lot of proton therapy masters projects recently that used te wrong physics lists \n\nI'd pick an easy to use toolkit like TOPAS and try and simulate some things that you can easily verify. Like HVLs or something.\n\nA good rule of thumb is if you find yourself crying at 2AM over an unattributed, 200 slide Geant4 presentation PDF you found on a semi-defunct ftp server, you're on the right path :)\n\n## Comment ID kw7h7ob with +1 score by [(MollyGodiva, Reddit, 2024-03-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalPhysics/comments/1bls1iz/looking_for_guidance_for_monte_carlo_simulation/kw7h7ob/) (in reply to ID 1bls1iz):\nThis BA, MS, or PhD level?\n\n### Comment ID kw7hl27 with +2 score by [(hadjhabibmebarak, Reddit, 2024-03-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalPhysics/comments/1bls1iz/looking_for_guidance_for_monte_carlo_simulation/kw7hl27/) (in reply to ID kw7h7ob):\nMs\n\n#### Comment ID kw7jpy3 with +10 score by [(MollyGodiva, Reddit, 2024-03-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalPhysics/comments/1bls1iz/looking_for_guidance_for_monte_carlo_simulation/kw7jpy3/) (in reply to ID kw7hl27):\nOk. So pick one code and use it. Don’t be a perfectionist. Pick a modest goal and meet it. If you can do more then bonus. Also try to get at least one paper out of it. MS theses are meant to be done in less then two years, but closer to 1.5. Take away two months for writing after all work is done and you have about 15 months. Also remember the goal is to graduate, not be a trailblazer."

And not in the cliche business way either.\n\nSpeaking of family... lots of young families here at MC. So while it is a startup, there's a healthy balance if you have kids yourself (and they are so accommodating for those with kids!)\n\nOn the tech side, lots of up-to-date tooling working with modern stuff. Feels good and fulfilling.\n\nHonestly hope to see MC through the end, whatever that might look like 🤞",

Monte Carlo focuses on what matters rather than what they think should matter based on some YC blog they read.\n2. Monte Carlo actually has a natural work-life balance because 1) they can avoid burnout this way and 2) most folks have kids at home. This means no Sunday 11pm emails, no calls scheduled after 6pm, etc. \n3. Monte Carlo is obsessed with solving a HUGE problem with a monumental TAM (Snowflake-sized) because anyone that uses a cloud-based data warehouse has a problem trusting their data. \n\nAs a result, Monte Carlo can provide best-in-class benefits (because we've raised a lot of VC from best-in-class investors), hire the best people, and work with the most data-first companies in the ecosystem. Creating and owning a new category that other companies like Datadog (market cap of $35B) and Snowflake (market cap of $80B) will eventually step into is also very satisfying. \n\nFinally, having a woman as CEO that is not some 25 year old wunderkid out of Stanford/MIT/Harvard means diversity, equity, and inclusion starts at the top. We can recruit some of the best talent (1:1 female to male ratio currently) because our culture is actually inclusive and not full of 26 year old white guys from SoMa/The Marina.",

Monte Carlo focuses on what matters rather than what they think should matter based on some YC blog they read.\n2. Monte Carlo actually has a natural work-life balance because 1) they can avoid burnout this way and 2) most folks have kids at home. This means no Sunday 11pm emails, no calls scheduled after 6pm, etc. \n3. Monte Carlo is obsessed with solving a HUGE problem with a monumental TAM (Snowflake-sized) because anyone that uses a cloud-based data warehouse has a problem trusting their data. \n\nAs a result, Monte Carlo can provide best-in-class benefits (because we've raised a lot of VC from best-in-class investors), hire the best people, and work with the most data-first companies in the ecosystem. Creating and owning a new category that other companies like Datadog (market cap of $35B) and Snowflake (market cap of $80B) will eventually step into is also very satisfying. \n\nFinally, having a woman as CEO that is not some 25 year old wunderkid out of Stanford/MIT/Harvard means diversity, equity, and inclusion starts at the top. We can recruit some of the best talent (1:1 female to male ratio currently) because our culture is actually inclusive and not full of 26 year old white guys from SoMa/The Marina.",

The support within the professional environment is incredible, and you're surrounded constantly by hardworking, innovative collaborators. Even the most junior folks have lots of opportunities to leave their mark and are recognized for it, which makes for a healthy dynamic where everyone shows off their best selves at work. Again, a lot of that is owed to the executives and the founding team who I think are just extraordinary.",

      "# [Snowflake Summit 2024 Keynote Recap: The Era of Enterprise AI by Michael Segner on 2024-06-04](https://www.montecarlodata.com/snowflake-summit-2024-keynote-recap-the-era-of-enterprise-ai/)\nWe’re covering the Snowflake Summit conference keynote for the third straight year (check out our 2022 and 2023 recaps). For Snowflake Summit 2024, festivities have moved from the Las Vegas desert to the San Francisco bay—and with its return to the tech capital came a whole list of buzzy new announcements.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSetting the Stage—Conference Pageantry and Neon Vibes\n\nCrossing the bigger-than-ever exhibitor “basecamp,” we shuffle to the keynote stage where we’re greeted by tasteful conference techno, lazer lights, and rollerbladers with ski poles.\n\nThe Moscone Center is one of the few locations that could hold this many people (rumors of a record 16,000 attendees this year add to the buzz), but still feel expansive. The keynote stage is the same.\n\nCapacity is massive and seats fill up gradually in the proceeding hour. One of my seatmates strikes up some small talk immediately disclaiming that he is on the business side and not very close to the tech, but excited to see what’s new.\n\nAs we wait, I Google to see if I can grab a sneak peek of any dropping news.\n\nIt’s hard to feel bad for a tech juggernaut, especially one that just announced record earnings, but I do feel a pang of empathy for the Snowflake press team as I’m hit with a wall of stories covering their denial of any culpability in the Ticketmaster breach. It looks like Snowflake is playing the cards close to the vest this year.\n\nThis year the stage will feature co-founder Benoît Dageville, EVP of product, Christian Kleinerman, and new CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy. Vegas is not laying odds on whether AI will feature prominently.\n\nThe opening video starts with big shots at big companies extolling the power of Snowflake. Fox, Paramount, and State Street rattle off one liners in quick succession.\n\nIt doesn’t really matter what they are saying–Snowflake is showing they have captured the hearts and minds of the C-suite in a way that we probably haven’t seen since Microsoft. Much of the keynote is directed to developers, but it would be a mistake to overlook what has made Snowflake a market juggernaut.\n\nGetting Geeky with Benoît\n\nAfter a short welcome and introduction from Sridhar Ramaswamy, Benoît takes the stage. There is an authenticity and energy to founder speakers that is hard to replicate, and Snowflake is wise to harness his swagger.\n\nHe gets a warm welcome from the crowd and immediately dives into the strategic vision of Snowflake which he outlines across 5 pillars. In a nutshell:\n\nData: The ability for Snowflake to handle all structured and unstructured data types.\n\nCompute: Elastic demand to run on any workloads. Not just separating compute from storage, but “compute from compute” with multiple workloads running on the same data.\n\nModels: Access to world class AI and LLM models including CortexAI and Arctic.\n\nGovernance: Snowpark Container Services and a unified platform for data and governance. “This is AI for enterprise, not AI for planning your next vacation.”\n\nCollaboration: Native apps and data sharing so you can share across regions and organizations.\n\nHis best line which drew some laughs was during the compute section when he reassured the audience that Snowflake was not a SQL engine contrary to what some might believe, “trust me I was there.” The long-term investment in the Dataflow engine, we are reminded, is the secret sauce that makes Snowflake the most efficient on the market.\n\nThroughout this overview of the big picture he hammered what is undoubtedly the central pillar of Snowflake’s strategic vision: simplicity.\n\nTaking A Journey With Christian Kleinerman\n\nThe rest of the keynote was MCed by Snowflake EVP of product Christian Kleinerman. He’s well suited to the role as a natural showman. You can feel the spontaneous energy coming from him, which is a welcome change from tightly scripted remarks, teleprompter reading, and stage blocking.\n\nThis year each product announcement is followed by a thumping sound effect letting the audience know it’s time to clap and creating a sense of building momentum. And on their own merits, the parade of announcements is genuinely exciting.\n\nIn this parade it’s easy to lose sight of what is perhaps the most ambitious move Snowflake is making. It’s not new and it’s not something they are trying to hide, but this year it became clear that they may be able to execute on the vision of being the “iPhone of data apps.”\n\nFor a company that owns the C-Suite like Microsoft, this Apple platform and tax vision is potentially game changing. In years past, it looked like the Snowflake Marketplace might sell you a ML app or a LLM model. As buzzy as those things are, they are pocket change and rapidly becoming commoditized. What Snowflake actually wants to sell you is each part of the modern data stack.\n\nThe exhibitor “basecamp” that is 8x the size of their competitors? All future apps to be purchased on your iPhone AI data cloud.\n\nBut let’s not digress too much. Let’s hop into each section of Christian’s talk: data, apps, AI.\n\nStrengthening the Data Foundation\n\nDocumentAI, Dynamic Tables, Iceberg, and Polaris\n\nChristian starts with reminding the crowd of the power of one of last year’s big announcements (and perhaps most unfortunately named feature): DocumentAI. This bland sounding feature actually describes the incredible capability to use natural language to ask questions about documents.\n\nWith flashing strobes and a big thump Christian announces DocumentAI will move to general availability. The well prompted crowd shows a fair amount of enthusiasm which is soon dwarfed by their reaction to Christian’s next announcement on the general availability of Dynamic Tables.\n\nDynamic Tables (which Monte Carlo supports) helps to transform data on load without the need for an additional target table. This feature simplifying the movement of data is exciting for all the data and analytical engineers in attendance.\n\nServerless Tasks, the open sourcing of the Polaris catalog, and the general availability of Iceberg across all crowds also get mentions and strong responses from the crowd. You have to wonder if Iceberg was set to get a greater share of the spotlight prior to the Databricks announcement earlier this morning regarding their acquisition of Tabular, the company founded by the original creators of Apache Iceberg.\n\nInterlude with Microsoft CVP Arun Ulagaratchagan\n\nArun took the stage next in a section that was a bit shoe-horned to demonstrate their partnership with Microsoft. Broad remarks on the importance of partnership, open source data formats, interoperability and Microsoft Fabric were made.\n\nWhile a bit tangential, it is nice to see the direction these platforms are taking toward interoperability and having Fabric OneLake queryable by Snowflake (even if it may be built on the back of Delta tables).\n\nGovernance, Compliance, Lineage\n\nChristian strode back on stage for the next set of data foundation announcements. Some of the bigger features highlighted included:\n\nUniversal Search: The one search bar that will help you find everything. Now generally available.\n\nInternal Marketplace: An extension of the Snowflake Marketplace but curated for your organization. Now in private preview\n\nAI Object Description: Leveraging CortexAI to automatically generate object descriptions. This is a feature included in many data catalogs that can sometimes seem superficial and counterintuitive. What you really want to understand from documentation is not usually what AI can intuit.\n\nData classification and custom classification: The ability to specify properties at the schema level or using specific rules to better identify, tag, and govern your data.\n\nObject Insights Interface: Horizon now contains upstream and downstream data lineage for a table within the Snowflake ecosystem. This includes ML lineage to models which is exciting. Snowflake has also introduced some basic data quality rule functionality.\n\nBuild and distribute apps\n\nContainer Services and Native Apps\n\nThis was the heart of the keynote and got the most energy from the crowd. It’s also the heart of their ambitious “iPhone” of the modern data stack strategy I detailed above.\n\nChristian relays the positive feedback Snowflake has received on both services before revealing that Snowflake Native Apps and Container Services will be fully integrated. So in other words, the native app framework that allows apps to be built, deployed, and monetized through the marketplace (and skip the procurement and security reviews) is now connected with the ability for developers to containerize their workloads in an accelerated dev cycle.\n\nI ran into a former colleague launching a financial application startup that is planning to aggressively take advantage of Snowpark Container Services and Native Apps. For them, these aren’t features, it’s going to be a big component of their competitive advantage.\n\nDemo Series with Jeff Hollan\n\nBecause “we’re integrating Container Services and Native Apps” undersells the vision, Snowflake Director of Product Management Jeff Hollan comes out to demonstrate. His energy is infectious and he’s clearly having fun, bad puns and all (I’m so excited I can barely contain myself).\n\nWe get three quick and compelling demos showing:\n\nAn app that uses hybrid tables to monitor telecom infrastructure uptime,\n\nA graph analytics native app that analyzes cell phone tower location and network resiliency, and\n\nA GenAI model running in Snowpark containers that is classifying the sentiment of customer support tickets and helping to generate responses.\n\nAll of the demos are impressive, but the crowd is especially responsive to the graphs analytics app as it dawns on them that a whole host of solutions that may have required quarter or year long procurement cycles could now be at their fingertips in minutes (if they have some spare Snowflake credits rattling around).\n\nThis is when it also dawns on me that Snowflake’s unique position of owning the data storage layer gives them an incredible opportunity not just to market a few shallow ML marketing spend optimization ML apps but to be the distribution channel for the modern data stack.\n\n“If you can dream it, you can build it in Snowflake.”\n\nDevOps, Snowflake Trail, and Notebooks\n\nChristian strides back on stage and takes a moment to feed off of Jeff’s energy and demo enthusiasm. He then quickly covers some features that I personally found to be among the most exciting.\n\nData reliability engineering has been rapidly maturing and trying to reach the auspicious milestones of site reliability engineering. Only recently have data teams started to treat their query code like their application code with processes like version control and pull requests.\n\nMonte Carlo, for example, will automatically correlate a code change to any data anomalies that may result from it.\n\nChristian’s announcements are in this vein of making query code a first class citizen including Git integration, database change management, Snowflake Notebooks and Snowflake CLI. He then also announced Snowflake Trail–a new observability (think application performance management not data observability) service that will help monitor code telemetry (metrics, traces, logs) across Snowflake.\n\nAccelerate AI\n\nWe have now made it to the third and final section of the three hour keynote and while the announcements are still exciting, energy levels are definitely starting to wane.\n\nChristian starts with asking the crowd who uses Pandas to do machine learning? And plays off the lack of raised hands joking, “looks like only Benoit.” Still, the Snowpark Pandas API entering public preview is a welcome addition. We then get a review of Snowflake end-to-end machine learning capabilities including the feature store and model registry (which Monte Carlo takes advantage of).\n\nWe’re now at the big AI announcements: Arctic, Snowflake Copilot, Cortex AI and Cortex Search.\n\nChristian puts Arctic, the LLMs built and released by Snowflake in the proper context. He didn’t overhype it as the next ChatGPT. He also struck the right balance between plugging its benefits in specific functions like generating SQL while pointing out there are a lot of models in the market with barely distinguishable performance metrics.\n\nChristian then plugged the more than 20,000 people using Snowflake Copilot as part of generating or fixing code in Snowflake before announcing that it is now generally available.\n\nCortexAI, which allows any user to query the data using natural language, seemed to be positioned a bit oddly as a replacement for data analysts and as a result got a more muted response from the very human crowd.\n\nInterlude with Snowflake Cortex with Amanda Kelly\n\nAmanda Kelly, Director of Product Management at Snowflake entered the stage for a clearly very well-rehearsed demo on Snowflake’s CortexAI, Snowflake’s fully managed service for hosting LLMs to –you guessed it – simplify the process for enterprise businesses to build GenAI apps.\n\nIt was pretty impressive to see her get a proof of concept for an app up and running within Snowflake in just minutes, and on the fly she prompted the LLM (in this case Mistral) to write an email “using a lot of happy emojis” – to which it happily and automatically obliged.\n\nThe Big Finale\n\nAnd then finally, for the penultimate announcement, Christian the Showman, took the biggest risk I’ve ever seen at a major tech keynote. It was fun, filled with promise, and a flop.\n\nI love that he and Snowflake went for it, and I hope the result doesn’t create future overly scripted keynotes. After repeating, “Cortex Search is so easy anyone can create a chatbot.” He proceeds to endeavor to prove his point by inviting a random member of the audience to conduct the next demo.\n\nWhat followed was a keynote demonstration for the ages.\n\nOur demo-er, Alicia, was truly a random member of the audience. Admitting that she’d only logged into Snowflake “a few times,” Alicia was excited to jump in head first. Unfortunately this ambitious, spontaneous demo ground to a halt as we learned that anyone can create a chatbot after a few attempts with Christian Kleinerman over your shoulder directing you where to click.\n\nUltimately, it’s a powerful message. Cortext Search can create a chatbot that only responds to information it knows within a professional context. It doesn’t know how to encourage your kids to eat more broccoli.\n\nOf course, Christian couldn’t resist the “oh and one more thing” Jobsian conference post-credits announcement. And in this regard, he certainly delivered. As we leave the keynote all of our Snowflake accounts have been transitioned to Dark Mode by default. A good ending to a good keynote.\n\nTwo years ago we had data warehouses and lakehouses. Today we have AI data clouds and data intelligence platforms. But the big takeaway this year is that data remains one of the most innovative and exciting industries to be in. I wouldn’t bet against these modern data platforms finding a way to make reality match the hype.\n\nOur promise: we will show you the product.",
      "# [Monte Carlo adds more GenAI to data observability platform by Eric Avidon, Sean Kerner on 2024-11-14](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/news/366615641/Monte-Carlo-adds-more-GenAI-to-data-observability-platform)\nNew capabilities\n\nAnalytics and AI tools demand high-quality data. Reports, dashboards, models and applications are only as good as the data that informs them. Without accurate data that can be trusted, analytics and AI tools will be inaccurate and untrustworthy.\n\nEnsuring data quality, however, is impossible even for teams of data experts.\n\nBefore the advent of cloud-based data warehouses and lakes that can store massive amounts of data, organizations kept their data in on-premises databases overseen by IT teams. Decision-makers had to submit tickets to IT departments requesting them to develop reports and dashboards, and IT teams could carefully check data for its quality before including it in an analytics product.\n\nNow, however, decisions need to be made in real time. Due to the cloud, organizations can collect and store exponentially more data than they could when data was exclusively kept on premises.\n\nAs a result, the sheer volume of data -- nearly half of all organizations now manage at least 500 petabytes of data -- makes it futile for data teams to even attempt to observe data for quality manually.\n\nEnter data observability vendors such as Monte Carlo, Acceldata, Metaplane and Soda Data -- among others -- that provide platforms that automate monitoring data.\n\nLike many of its peers, Monte Carlo was founded late last decade. Since its start in 2019, the vendor has added to and improved its capabilities to better enable customers to track data as it moves through pipelines and informs analytics and AI tools. Over the past two years, that has included developing generative AI-powered features to simplify data observability, including a tool that enables users to generate code using natural language and another that uses generative AI to suggest fixes in code.\n\nNow the vendor is adding a new generative AI feature.\n\nGenAI Monitor Recommendations uses a large language model (LLM) to examine an organization's data and deliver recommendations for developing and deploying data quality monitors. Development and deployment can then be executed by technical and non-technical users alike with previously existing generative AI tools such as Generate with AI.\n\nGenAI Monitor Recommendations is powered by Data Explorer, Monte Carlo's data profiling engine. Integrated with an LLM, Data Explorer uses generative AI to discover relationships between columns and patterns in data that would be nearly impossible for humans to find.\n\nSubsequently, GenAI Monitor Recommendations suggests data quality rules and monitors to build and deploy that help users engender trust in the data they use to train analytics and AI tools.\n\nTrust, meanwhile, is a critical focus for all data management and analytics vendors as they seek to help customers develop analytics and AI tools, according to Aslett. If users don't trust the data underlying reports, dashboards, models and applications, they won't use the analytics and AI tools to inform decisions.\n\n\"As enterprises seek to automate aspects of their decision-making processes using AI, it is essential that they have confidence in the data upon which AI depends,\" Aslett said. \"This has increased the focus on data observability software providers and the role they play in ensuring data meets quality and reliability requirements.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the use of generative AI tools to automate and improve data observability is somewhat nascent, he continued. As a result, Monte Carlo's addition of GenAI Monitor Recommendations is not only significant for users, but it could also help the vendor differentiate itself from its peers.\n\n\"The use of GenAI in data observability is still emerging and has not yet been widely adopted by data observability software providers, so the launch of GenAI Monitor Recommendations gives Monte Carlo a potential competitive advantage over some of its rivals in lowering the barriers to widespread adoption,\" Aslett said.\n\nStewart Bond, an analyst at IDC, noted that GenAI Monitor Recommendations fits into the concept of AI for data, which is one of the main areas in which data-driven organizations are investing. AI for data simply means using technologies such as data observability that are embedded with AI to make them more accurate and efficient.\n\nIn addition, GenAI Monitor Recommendations aligns with the increasing emphasis on data quality demanded by surging enterprise interest in developing AI tools, Bond continued.\n\n\"Data quality has to be addressed to improve the accuracy and relevancy of AI outcomes,\" he said.\n\nAs a result, GenAI Monitor Recommendations is a timely addition for Monte Carlo that addresses user needs, according to Bond.\n\n\"Adding GenAI capabilities to Monte Carlo is an important feature for users,\" he said. \"Manual processes are no longer reasonable, and relationships within data not recognizable without using technology to uncover them.\"\n\nRegarding the impetus for developing GenAI Monitor Recommendations, Lior Gavish, co-founder and chief technology officer of Monte Carlo, noted that much of the vendor's product development aims to help users be more productive and extract more value from their data.\n\nGenAI Monitor Recommendations aims to address both.\n\n\"Writing data quality rules takes time, and the larger or more complex the data or the environment becomes, that time really adds up,\" Gavish said. \"With GenAI Monitor Recommendations, our customers receive actionable recommendations for new monitors based on relational patterns in their data, saving them time from having to write dozens if not hundreds of rules manually.\"\n\nIn addition, because generative AI is able to monitor data for semantic meaning, it enables the discovery of relationships between data points and datasets that might not otherwise be discovered, Gavish continued.\n\n\"That can catch issues that may have otherwise gone undetected [and do so] before they wreak havoc on the business,\" he said.\n\nWhile GenAI Monitor Recommendations provides new generative AI-fueled data observability capabilities, Monte Carlo's DataOps Dashboard is designed to equip organizations with a means of easily viewing operational metrics and tracking the progress of data quality initiatives.\n\nBy providing users with a clear view of metrics that show data quality, users will better understand whether data can be trusted and used to inform analytics and AI projects to make decisions or if it needs to be improved before it can be operationalized.\n\nData observability metrics populating the DataOps Dashboard include response times for monitor alerts, incident resolution times, total number of incidents, severity of incidents and responsible parties for rectifying incidents.\n\nJust as the motivation for developing GenAI Monitor Recommendations is to save users time and derive more value from their data, efficiency and value provided the impetus for creating the DataOps Dashboard, according to Gavish.\n\n\"In the same way that [application performance monitoring] solutions help teams not just detect issues but also root cause and resolve them, Monte Carlo is dedicated to helping teams reduce the amount of time and resources spent on data quality,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, given the added insight into data observability provided by the DataOps Dashboard, it is a beneficial new tool for Monte Carlo customers, according to Aslett.\n\n\"DataOps can enable data professionals to measure improvements related to the use of data and demonstrate the value of their role to the wider organization,\" he said. \"Monte Carlo already provides users with key metrics related to the health of specific datasets. The DataOps Dashboard provides additional operational context to provide a more holistic view of data reliability.\"",
      "# [All About ETL Testing: Checklist, Tools, and 4 Useful SQL Queries by Lindsay MacDonald on 2024-08-19](https://www.montecarlodata.com/blog-all-about-etl-testing-checklist/)\nETL (extract, transform, and load) testing is essentially the data world’s version of a highly rigorous proofreading session.\n\nImagine if The Wall Street Journal published articles without a final read-through. There might be typos, the facts might be jumbled, or worse, the entire argument could be upside down. So they have editors that scrutinize every word.\n\nJust as a news editor ensures the clarity and accuracy of an article before it hits your screen, ETL testing is the unsung hero ensuring the data your business relies on is spot-on.\n\nETL testing aims to ensure that the data loaded into a target system is accurate, complete, and consistent, and that it adheres to quality standards.\n\nWhen is ETL testing needed?\n\nReally, any time an E, T, or L occurs you should do ETL testing. Some common scenarios are:\n\nData Warehousing Projects: Any time data from multiple sources is consolidated for reporting and analytics purposes.\n\nData Migration Projects: Make sure the data is migrated accurately without any loss or corruption.\n\nBusiness Intelligence (BI) Projects: Accurate and timely data is required for analysis and decision-making.\n\nData Integration Projects: In projects where data from different sources needs to be integrated, ETL testing ensures that the integrated data is consistent and accurate.\n\nRegulatory Compliance: In industries like healthcare and finance, regulatory compliance mandates accurate and complete data reporting.\n\nData Quality Assurance: Identify and rectify data quality issues like duplicate records, missing values, and inconsistencies in data.\n\nETL testing checklist\n\nHere are the essential aspects of each ETL phase:\n\nExtract\n\n🔲 Data extraction logic matches the specified requirements?\n\n🔲 Correct data is pulled from the source?\n\n🔲 No data loss?\n\nTransform\n\n🔲 Data transformation rules are applied?\n\n🔲 Special characters and data types are handled correctly?\n\n🔲 No corruption or unintended changes?\n\nLoad\n\n🔲 Logging is in place to capture failures?\n\n🔲 All data is loaded into the target system?\n\n🔲 No duplicates, nulls, or other data quality errors?\n\n🔲 Consistency across data fields and records?\n\n🔲 Compliance with all relevant data governance and security policies?\n\n🔲 Meets business requirements and user expectations?\n\nGeneral\n\n🔲 Security checked for data at rest and in transit?\n\n🔲 Scalability tests to ensure the system can handle increased data volumes?\n\nPopular SQL queries for ETL testing\n\nWith its many functions and operators, SQL is an indispensable tool to interact directly with the data in its native environment so you can validate and verify it. Here are some example SQL queries for different types of ETL testing scenarios:\n\n1. Test Data Completeness\n\nTo check if all the records from the source system are loaded into the target system, you might use a simple count query on both systems and compare the results:\n\n-- Count records in the source table SELECT COUNT(*) as source_count FROM source_table; -- Count records in the target table SELECT COUNT(*) as target_count FROM target_table;\n\n2.Test Data Transformation Rules\n\nTo validate that the transformation rules have been applied correctly, you can write queries that reflect these rules and compare the output against expected results. Suppose a rule states that all emails in the customer data should be converted to lowercase:\n\n-- Check if email addresses are transformed to lowercase SELECT email FROM target_table WHERE BINARY email != LOWER(email);\n\nThis query selects any email from the target table that does not match its lowercase version, shining light on an issue with the transformation rule.\n\n3. Test Data Quality\n\nFor example you can check for null values, duplicates, or correct data ranges. Here’s how you might check for null values in mandatory fields:\n\n-- Check for NULL values in a mandatory column SELECT COUNT(*) FROM target_table WHERE mandatory_column IS NULL; To check for duplicate records: -- Check for duplicate records based on a unique identifier SELECT unique_identifier, COUNT(*) FROM target_table GROUP BY unique_identifier HAVING COUNT(*) > 1; ​-- Check that data falls within acceptable ranges SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE numeric_column < lower_bound OR numeric_column > upper_bound;\n\n4. Test Data Integration\n\nTo verify that data from different sources has been integrated correctly, you might need to compare key fields that should be consistent across the tables:\n\n-- Compare data across two tables SELECT a.key_field, b.key_field FROM table_a a JOIN table_b b ON a.key_field = b.key_field WHERE a.other_field != b.other_field;\n\nUse the right tool for the job\n\nWhile you can cobble together ETL testing automations in SQL or Python, sophisticated ETL scenarios call for more specialized tools.\n\nFor exotic stuff like non-relational databases, streaming data, or just messy, unformatted data – especially if your job involves the financial and operational backbone of major enterprises – a better way to find and fix bad data fast is data observability platform like Monte Carlo.\n\nMonte Carlo offers a full suite of tools to help you gain full visibility into your data, systems, and code.

      "# [Most Data Quality Initiatives Fail Before They Start. Here’s Why. by Barr Moses on 2024-07-19](https://www.montecarlodata.com/blog-data-quality-scorecard-data-quality-initiative/)\nEvery day I talk to organizations ready to dedicate a tremendous amount of time and resources towards data quality initiatives doomed to fail.\n\nIt’s no revelation that incentives and KPIs drive good behavior. Sales compensation plans are scrutinized so closely that they often rise to the topic of board meetings. What if we gave the same attention to data quality scorecards?\n\nEven in their heyday, traditional data quality scorecards from the Hadoop era were rarely wildly successful. I know this because prior to starting Monte Carlo, I spent years as an operations VP trying to create data quality standards that drove trust and adoption.\n\nOver the past few years, advances in the cloud and metadata management have made organizing silly amounts of data possible. Data engineering processes are starting to trend towards the level of maturity and rigor of more longstanding engineering disciplines. And of course, AI has the potential to streamline everything.\n\nWhile this problem isn’t – and probably will never be – completely solved, I have seen organizations adopt best practices that are the difference between initiative success…and having another kick-off meeting 12 months later.\n\nHere are 4 key lessons for building data quality scorecards:\n\nKnow what data matters\n\nMeasure the machine\n\nGet your carrots and sticks right\n\nAutomate evaluation and discovery\n\nKnow what data matters\n\nThe most sure way to fail any data related initiative is to assume all data is of equal value. And the best only way to determine what matters is to talk to the business.\n\nBrandon Beidel at Red Ventures articulates a good place to start:\n\n“I’d ask:\n\nHow do you use this table?\n\nWhen do you look at this data? When do you report this data? Does this data need to be up to the minute, hourly, daily?\n\nWhat purpose does this serve?\n\nWho needs to get notified if this data is delayed?”\n\nNow, this may be easier said than done if you work for a sprawling organization with tens of thousands of employees distributed across the globe.\n\nIn these cases, my recommendation is to start with your most business critical data business units (if you don’t know that, I can’t help you!). Start a discussion on requirements and priorities.\n\nJust remember: prove the concept first, scale second. You’d be shocked how many people do it the other way around.\n\nMeasure the machine\n\nOne of the enduring challenges to this type of endeavor, in a nutshell, is data quality resists standardization. Quality is, and should be, in the eye of the beholder use case.\n\nThe six dimensions of data quality are a vital part of any data quality scorecard and an important starting point, but for many teams, that’s just the beginning – and every data product is different. For instance, a financial report may need to be highly accurate with some margin for timeliness whereas a machine learning model may be the exact opposite.\n\nFrom an implementation perspective this means measuring data quality has typically been radically federated. Data quality is measured on a table-by-table basis by different analysts or stewards with wildly different data quality rules given wildly different weights.\n\nThis makes sense to a degree, but so much gets lost in translation. Data is multi-use and shared across use cases. Not only is one person’s “yellow” quality score another person’s “green,” but it’s often incredibly difficult for data consumers to even understand what a “yellow” score means or how it’s been graded. They also frequently miss the implications of a green table being fed data by a red one (you know, garbage in, garbage out…).\n\nSurfacing the number of breached rules is important, of course, but you also need to:\n\nContextualize it as much as possible,\n\nHave an aggregated end-to-end data product view,\n\nInvest in some strong no-code data profiling, and\n\nRealize it’s not sufficient.\n\nSo then what else do you need? You need to measure the machine.\n\nIn other words, the components in the production and delivery of data that generally result in high quality. This is much easier to standardize. It’s also easier to understand across business units and teams.\n\nAirbnb Midas is one of the more well known internal data quality score and certification programs and rightfully so. They lean heavily into this concept. They measure data accuracy– but reliability, stewardship, and usability actually comprise 60% of the total score.\n\nMany data teams are still in the process of formalize their own standards, but the components we have found to highly correlate to data health include:\n\nThe previously mentioned six dimensions of data quality (validity, completeness, consistency, timeliness, uniqueness, accuracy).\n\nUsability & Stewardship: Typically via a data observability platform, data catalog solution, or both.\n\nDocumentation: Some level of semantic meaning for both the data asset, its use, and past incidents. One online travel search company scores an asset based on how and where it’s cataloged along with the completeness of its metadata for two of its 6 categories.\n\nLineage: Ability to trace the data’s provenance at the field level across systems.\n\nUsage: The number of queries a table receives and the number of data products with downstream dependencies. This can be a “key asset score” and it has a flywheel effect. You focus your reliability efforts on what’s most utilized, and people trust what’s popular.\n\nSystem Reliability: Typically via a data observability solution.\n\nMonitoring: Generally if a data product has strong coverage not only on the last mile table but all the way upstream, it indicates a well curated asset.\n\nFreshness: Data freshness requirements will vary by data product type, but it is a table level metric where deviations from the norm can be identified and surfaced. Many organizations like Roche Diagnostics will have specific freshness SLAs for their data products and measure the level of adherence.\n\nVolume: A relatively steady number of rows a table receives is often a sign of a well functioning pipeline and data delivery system.\n\nSchema: At the very least you want consumers to have visibility into schema changes. For your most critical pipelines, you ideally want some level of schema enforcement or data contract so that you know when changes at the source break assets downstream.\n\nOperational Response: Typically via a data observability solution.\n\nOwnership: Does an asset have an owner? Bonus for if it has both a technical and business owner.\n\nNotification Channels & Communication: Data delivery is a complex process involving multiple handoffs from ingestion to aggregation to consumption. On top of that, you ideally have multiple teams using a data asset (or else your mesh is more of a silo). The only way to have a reliable data product in this environment is to have a central communication channel to highlight and discuss changes and incidents.\n\nAverage Time To Fixed: Arguably the most important indicator of how much you can trust a dataset is in how quickly the support team responds and fixes incidents that arise. Bad data is inevitable. Great incident response is intentional.\n\nGet your carrots and sticks right\n\n“Yay, another set of processes we’re required to follow!”… said no one ever.\n\nRemember the purpose of measuring data health isn’t to measure data health. The point, as Clark at Airbnb put it, is to “drive a preference for producing and using high quality data.”\n\nThe best practices I’ve seen here are to have a minimum set of requirements for data to be on-boarded onto the platform (stick) and a much more stringent set of requirements to be certified at each level (carrot).\n\nCertification works as a carrot because producers actually want consumers to use their data, and consumers will quickly discern and develop a taste for highly reliable data.\n\nAnd the best way to ensure requirements are met? Making data quality a self-serve process through data observability.\n\nData observability helps consumers and producers work towards building KPIs and SLAs around data quality, rolling them out, and holding the organization accountable.\n\nFor data consumers, data observability allows you to understand the reliability, accuracy, and usability of your data for generating insights and data products as measured by their data quality scores.\n\nFor data producers, these solutions help generate the score itself and in turn informs issue triaging and resolution. Unlike traditional approaches to data quality measurement, data observability takes it a step further and also allows data producers to easily improve their data quality scores via monitoring and root cause analysis, and to continuously report on them.\n\nAutomate evaluation and discovery\n\nAlmost nothing in data management is successful without some degree of automation and the ability to self-service. Airbnb discarded any scoring criteria that 1) wasn’t immediately understandable and 2) couldn’t be measured automatically.\n\nYour organization must do the same. Even if it’s the best scoring criteria that has ever been conceived, if you do not have a set of solutions that will automatically collect and surface it, into the trash bin it must go.\n\nThe most common ways I’ve seen this done are with data observability and quality solutions, and data catalogs. Roche, for example, does this and layers on access management as part of creating, surfacing and governing trusted data products.\n\nOf course this can also be done by manually stitching together the metadata from multiple data systems into a homegrown discoverability portal, but just be mindful of the maintenance overhead.\n\nWhat’s measured is managed\n\nData teams have made big investments into their modern data and AI platforms. But to maximize this investment, the organization – both data producers and consumers – must fully adopt and trust the data being provided.\n\nAt the end of the day, what’s measured is managed. And isn’t that what matters?\n\nTo learn more about how you can build data quality scorecards – and deliver high quality data to your stakeholders – reach out to the Monte Carlo team.\n\nOur promise: we will show you the product.",
      "# [Monte Carlo aids data observability with root cause analysis by Eric Avidon on 2024-10-07](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/news/366612784/Monte-Carlo-aids-data-observability-with-root-cause-analysis)\nNew capabilities\n\nData quality is imperative, perhaps more so now than ever as enterprise interest in AI increases and more processes get automated.\n\nWith data being the foundation for analytics and AI, data needs to be accurate for the decisions based on analytics and AI to likewise be accurate. Meanwhile, with data volume increasing exponentially and the complexity of data also rising, it's impossible for even teams of humans to monitor every data point and data set for quality.\n\nIn response, vendors such as Monte Carlo and other data observability specialists including Acceldata, Metaplane and Soda have developed platforms that automatically monitor data for quality and alert users when incidents occur.\n\nThose alerts, however, have to do with the data points and data sets rather than the underlying code. Therefore, to remedy an incident, data engineers and other experts still have to trace the incident back to its source -- its root cause -- before it can be fixed. That process can take on average 15 hours, according to a survey of more than 200 data professionals by Monte Carlo and Wakefield Research.\n\nThat's nearly two full workdays just to find the source of a single incident and get it remedied. Root cause analysis aims to eliminate much of the time and expense related to discovering and resolving the changes that cause data quality problems.\n\nData quality issues can often be traced to one of three causes, according to Gavish: problems with the data itself, something amiss in a system or trouble with code.\n\nMonte Carlo's new root cause analysis capabilities specifically target issues with Databricks and GitLab code, whether they are simple coding mistakes by developers and engineers or unforeseen consequences of intentional updates.\n\nDevelopers and engineers get alerts when incidents are detected, including information that correlates the incident with the specific change that caused it. As a result, downtime -- the time it takes to resolve data quality problems -- is reduced by about 80%, according to Monte Carlo.\n\n\"When it comes to resolving data issues, speed is everything,\" Gavish said. \"Being able to quickly root cause code-related issues leads to faster resolution. When you have visibility into data, systems and code issues all in one platform, it's much easier to understand the root cause.\"\n\nSpecifically, using Monte Carlo's new root cause analysis capabilities, the data observability vendor's customers can easily view Databricks query logs and query changes for each table. By doing so, they can see whether there was a query change to that particular table or a table in another part of the data pipeline, and if that change is the cause of the problem.\n\nSimilarly, Monte Carlo's new capabilities enable GitLab users to see which pull requests are linked to which tables. This can help users understand when those requests occurred and new code was merged, and if that new code is causing a data quality issue.\n\nGiven the visibility they enable, Monte Carlo's new root cause analysis capabilities for Databricks query code and GitLab pull requests are significant for the data observability vendor's customers, according to Petrie.\n\n\"Data teams frequently revise transformation code to meet changing business requirements, adjust formats, filter columns and so on,\" he said. \"While they try to minimize errors by branching and testing pipeline code, some problems inevitably get into production and break data quality. Monte Carlo helps data engineers spot those errors faster by autodetecting anomalous logs.\"\n\nGiven its potential impact for developers and engineers, Monte Carlo has plans to expand its data observability platform to include root cause analysis capabilities beyond Databricks and GitLab.\n\nDatabricks and GitLab are each popular environments for developers, with Databricks aggressively building an environment for developing generative AI, traditional AI and machine learning models during the past couple of years. However, many developers and engineers prefer other platforms for building data and AI models and applications.\n\nTo meet their needs, Monte Carlo plans to expand its root cause analysis capabilities beyond Databricks and GitLab, according to Gavish, though he did not specify which platforms the company plans to target next.\n\n\"We are constantly exploring and building new and stronger ways to enhance Monte Carlo's resolution capabilities,\" he said. \"We believe strongly in empowering our customers to resolve data issues right where they start.\"",
      "# [Finding Happiness in Major Career Moves at Monte Carlo Data by Conlan Carter on 2024-03-29](https://builtin.com/articles/finding-happiness-major-career-moves-monte-carlo-data)\nMuch like Monte Carlo’s data observability platform finds better ways for data to be useful for its customers, it has found its employees from unique and unconventional places and backgrounds.\n\nDevon McMahon, an outbound sales development representative, earned a wealth of experience working in local municipalities as a 9-1-1 dispatcher and police officer before ultimately ending up in sales. Working in law enforcement meant many long hours away from home — pushing McMahon to consider a career with healthier work-life boundaries.\n\n“I found myself unbalanced with the amount of time I was away from family and how much of myself I was leaving behind at work every day,” McMahon said.\n\nWhen McMahon’s friends suggested he’d do well in sales, he was thrilled to explore the parallels between tech sales and police work.\n\n“I was an expert in California criminal law and process similar to how a salesperson is an expert in the product and problem it can solve,” McMahon explained. “The role is to be a guide and identify positive outcomes.”\n\nAfter over a decade of working outside of the tech industry, McMahon found his way to Monte Carlo, a startup environment where growth opportunities were made easier to find by a talented team of leaders and mentors, all of whom encourage new employees to take ownership of their own career paths — whatever they may look like. While a career shift can feel to many like a setback, finding a role at Monte Carlo meant also finding a good, balanced place to thrive for McMahon.\n\n“The environment nurtures my professional and personal growth,” he said. “Sales is hard in a different way than being a police officer,” he said.\n\nOn the sales team, the support from experienced account executives and management allowed McMahon to ask questions, bounce ideas off others and envision his future in tech sales. A top-performing SDR, McMahon is now a team lead, sharing the lessons he’s learning with junior sales colleagues — many of those lessons emerged from years in public service. Now, as an SDR leader, McMahon sees his former career as unparalleled experience in customer service.\n\n“I knew the folks in the community I served didn’t get to choose who showed up to their call, and it was my responsibility to provide the best service possible. Often I would be talking to people on the worst day of their lives, and I might have been the first police officer they’d ever met. I wanted each person to understand why I was doing what I was doing and what to expect next.”\n\n“The role is to be a guide and identify positive outcomes.”\n\nNow, McMahon’s professional first impressions with the general public have an entirely different context, but thanks to the culture at Monte Carlo, he’s well-equipped with a unique background that sets him apart as a tech salesperson.\n\nWhile tech sales may have been the endpoint for McMahon as he transitioned from policework, for Backend Engineer Sam Smith, tech sales was the starting point. While it only took a year for Smith to realize tech sales was not the right fit, the exposure led him to a new goal: a role in software engineering.\n\nSmith quit his sales role to drive for Lyft full-time while attending a coding boot camp, which landed him his first role in support engineering. Eventually, this led him to a support engineer position at Monte Carlo.\n\n“It has been a windy road to get to this point,” Smith said.\n\nWhen approached about a position at Monte Carlo, Smith clarified that, while he was excited about a support engineer position, his ultimate goal was engineering itself. Leveraging his experience in support engineering for his first year at the startup, Smith helped build the early support team, ultimately leading him to his first proper software engineer title — a lateral, internal move at Monte Carlo.\n\n“When I became a software engineer, I fulfilled a goal that I had set out on almost eight years prior,” Smith said. “It was by far the biggest career success of my life and something that still gives me a lot of personal satisfaction to think about.”\n\n“Becoming a software engineer was by far the biggest career success of my life and something that still gives me a lot of personal satisfaction to think about.”\n\nThis career pivot started with Smith’s years of experience as a support engineer, which prepared him well for a fast-paced tech startup environment. As a support engineer, Smith’s skillset for “survivability” in navigating unfamiliar technology allowed him to confidently tackle new challenges, utilizing the same skills to grow as a software engineer working on new projects.\n\n“As a support engineer, you have to be able to move fast and be ok with getting thrown into new technologies and documentation and quickly pull out useful information,” Smith said. “In a lot of ways, it feels like every project I worked on in the first few months as a software engineer were stretch projects.”\n\nJoining a robust team of software engineers with decades of experience, Smith has found joy in code reviews and regular conversations about tech-related topics as continuous opportunities to become a better engineer. While his team moves quickly, Smith has embraced the speed as an “absolute blessing” as he gets a variety of engineering experience. Now, finally, on his preferred career path, Smith feels all the more excited about where this journey will take him.\n\n“I have had jobs before where the thought of being in the same role five years down the road would fill me with dread,” Smith said. “Now I think about being a software engineer at Monte Carlo five, ten years down the road, and it makes me really excited.”\n\n“I think about being a software engineer at Monte Carlo five, ten years down the road, and it makes me really excited.”\n\nStories like Smith’s and McMahon’s are not atypical on the Monte Carlo team. As Head of Recruiting, Brenda Tern has seen many similar stories of exciting career growth at Monte Carlo, including her own.\n\nWith years of experience in recruiting leadership, Tern joined Monte Carlo to help find the right talent for the growing organization, and over a year and a half, her role expanded to cover human resources. As budding companies, startups typically have a significant gap in HR resources, and as Tern became responsible for more HR-related areas of the company, she discovered a “true calling and passion for the entire people function” beyond recruiting.\n\n“I've gained more experience during my time at Monte Carlo than I ever had in any other role due to the unstructured environment that makes our culture so unique,” said Tern.\n\n“I've gained more experience during my time at Monte Carlo than I ever had in any other role due to the unstructured environment that makes our culture so unique.”\n\nAs someone uniquely positioned to speak on Monte Carlo’s career growth opportunities, Tern explained that employees are given autonomy in their career path. While not everyone holds an end goal in mind, leadership at Monte Carlo encourages their direct reports to ask questions and take on stretch projects while they can.\n\n“We want everyone to advocate for how they see their careers evolve — and leaders are there to help provide guidance and feedback, but ultimately it's up to the individual,” said Tern.\n\nAdditionally, Tern cited the success of a recently established mentorship program, where members of the women's ERG are paired with employees looking for career guidance, and executive coaching is available to employees who request it.\n\nHelping to provide many of these newer career opportunities is Tern, who has an exciting Monte Carlo career journey all her own. From recruiting to the complex world of benefits, compensation, leadership coaching and more, Tern is helping shape the careers of present and future employees at Monte Carlo Data.",

      "# [Monte Carlo by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2002-10-25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo)\nQuarter and ward of Monaco\n\nFor other uses, see Monte Carlo (disambiguation).\n\nQuarter and ward in Monaco\n\nMonte Carlo ( MON-tee KAR-loh, Italian: [ˈmonte ˈkarlo]; French: Monte-Carlo, French: [mɔ̃te kaʁlo]; or colloquially Monte-Carl, French: [mɔ̃te kaʁl]; Monégasque: Munte Carlu, Ligurian: [ˈmuŋte ˈkaɾlu]; lit. 'Mount Charles') is an official administrative area of Monaco, specifically the ward of Monte Carlo/Spélugues, where the Monte Carlo Casino is located. Informally, the name also refers to a larger district, the Monte Carlo Quarter (corresponding to the former municipality of Monte Carlo), which besides Monte Carlo/Spélugues also includes the wards of La Rousse/Saint Roman, Larvotto/Bas Moulins and Saint Michel. The permanent population of the ward of Monte Carlo is about 3,500, while that of the quarter is about 15,000. Monaco has four traditional quarters, from west to east they are: Fontvieille (the newest), Monaco-Ville (the oldest), La Condamine, and Monte Carlo.\n\nMonte Carlo is situated on a prominent escarpment at the base of the Maritime Alps along the French Riviera. Near the quarter's western end is the \"world-famous Place du Casino, the gambling center ... that has made Monte Carlo an international byword for the extravagant display and reckless dispersal of wealth\".[1] It is also the location of the Hôtel de Paris, Café de Paris and Salle Garnier (the casino theatre which is the home of the Opéra de Monte-Carlo). The quarter's eastern part includes the community of Larvotto with Monaco's only public beach, as well as its new convention center (the Grimaldi Forum), and the Monte-Carlo Bay Hotel & Resort. At the quarter's eastern border, one crosses into the French town of Beausoleil (sometimes referred to as Monte-Carlo-Supérieur), and 8 kilometres (5 mi) to its east is the western border of Italy.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: History of Monaco\n\nIn 1856, Charles III of Monaco granted a concession to Napoleon Langlois and Albert Aubert,[2] to establish a sea-bathing facility for the treatment of various diseases, and to build a German-style casino.[3]\n\nThe initial casino opened in La Condamine in 1862, but was unsuccessful. It relocated several times, before reaching its present location in the \"Les Spélugues\" (The Caves) area of Monte Carlo. Success came slowly, largely because Monaco was inaccessible from much of Europe. The railway, installed in 1868, brought with it an influx of people, and Monte Carlo grew in wealth.[3]\n\nSaint-Charles Church on Monte Carlo's Avenue Sainte-Charles was completed in 1883. It was restored in its centenary year.[4][5]\n\nThe municipality of Monte Carlo was created in 1911, when the constitution divided the principality of Monaco into three municipalities. Monte Carlo encompassed the existing neighborhoods of La Rousse/Saint Roman, Larvotto/Bas Moulins, and Saint Michel. The municipalities merged in 1917, after accusations that the government used them to \"divide and conquer\". Since then, they became wards. Today, Monaco is divided into 9 wards, which are grouped into 4 quartiers.\n\nThe quarter of Monte Carlo was served by tramways from 1898 to 1931. It linked all parts of Monaco (see transportation in Monaco). In 2003 a new cruise ship pier was completed in the harbour at Monte Carlo.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nMonte Carlo has an area of 28.14 hectares (0.28 square kilometers or 69.19 acres) and faces the Mediterranean Sea, bordered to the west by Ravin de Sainte-Dévote and La Condamine, and to the east by La Rousse and Larvotto.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nMonte Carlo has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: Csa), which is influenced by oceanic climate and humid subtropical climate. As a result, it has warm, dry summers and mild, rainy winters.[6]\n\nClimate data for Monte Carlo Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Average sea temperature °C (°F) 13.4\n\n(56.2) 13.0\n\n(55.5) 13.4\n\n(56.1) 14.6\n\n(58.4) 18.0\n\n(64.3) 21.8\n\n(71.3) 23.1\n\n(73.6) 23.6\n\n(74.4) 22.2\n\n(71.9) 19.6\n\n(67.2) 17.4\n\n(63.3) 14.9\n\n(58.9) 17.9\n\n(64.3) Mean daily daylight hours 9.0 10.0 12.0 13.0 15.0 15.0 15.0 14.0 12.0 11.0 10.0 9.0 12.1 Average Ultraviolet index 1 2 4 5 7 8 8 7 5 3 2 1 4.4 Source: Weather Atlas [8]\n\nSport\n\n[edit]\n\nMonte Carlo is home to an ATP Masters 1000 tennis tournament during the clay court season usually played during the end of March through mid to late April. Monte Carlo is a popular tax haven for many tennis professionals and home to many active and retired athletes. Monte Carlo is host to most of the Circuit de Monaco, on which the Formula One Monaco Grand Prix takes place. It also hosts world championship boxing bouts, the European Poker Tour Grand Final and the World Backgammon Championship as well as the Monaco International Auto Show (Fr: Salon International de l'Automobile de Monaco[10]), fashion shows and other events. Although the Monte Carlo Masters tennis tournament is billed as taking place in the community, its actual location is in the adjacent French commune of Roquebrune-Cap-Martin. The Monte Carlo Rally is one of the longest running and most respected car rallies; from 1973 to 2008 and again from 2012, it marks the start of World Rally Championship season, having also served as the curtain-raiser for the Intercontinental Rally Challenge between 2009 and 2011. The rally, however, takes place outside the Monte Carlo quarter and is run mostly on French roads.\n\nTourism\n\n[edit]\n\nMonte Carlo has been visited by royalty as well as the public and movie stars for decades. Monte Carlo is one of Europe's leading tourist resorts, although many of the key tourist destinations are in other parts of Monaco, including such attractions as Monaco Cathedral, the Napoleon Museum, the Oceanographic Museum and aquarium, and the Prince's Palace, all of which are in Monaco-Ville.\n\nSalle Garnier\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Opéra de Monte-Carlo\n\nThe Opéra de Monte-Carlo or Salle Garnier was built to designs of the architect Charles Garnier, who also designed the Paris opera house now known as the Palais Garnier. Although much smaller, the Salle Garnier is very similar in style with decorations in red and gold, and frescoes and sculptures all around the auditorium. It was inaugurated on 25 January 1879 with a performance by Sarah Bernhardt dressed as a nymph. The first opera performed there was Robert Planquette's Le Chevalier Gaston on 8 February 1879, and that was followed by three more in the first season.[11]\n\nOther famous twentieth-century singers to appear at Monte Carlo included Titta Ruffo, Geraldine Farrar, Mary Garden, Tito Schipa, Beniamino Gigli, Claudia Muzio, Georges Thill, and Lily Pons.\n\nHôtel de Paris\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Hôtel de Paris Monte-Carlo\n\nThe Hôtel de Paris, established in 1864 by Charles III of Monaco, is located on the west side of the Place du Casino in the heart of Monte Carlo. It belongs to the Société des bains de mer de Monaco (SBM), and is part of the elite Palace Grand Hotels in Monaco with the Hotel Hermitage, the Monte-Carlo Beach Hotel, Monte-Carlo Bay Hotel & Resort, the Hotel Metropole and Fairmont hotel.[12]\n\nThe hotel has 106 rooms divided into four groups based on type of view, decoration and luxury.[13] The Exclusive City View offers 20 rooms, the Superior Courtyard has 29 large rooms, the Exclusive Sea View 59 and the Exclusive Casino has six.\n\nAdditionally, there are 74 suites and junior suites which are grouped similarly, offering more luxury than the rooms. There are single and double suites as well as courtyard junior suites and Sea/Casino Junior suites.[13] There is also one Presidential suite.[14]\n\nIn October 2014, a renovation project began, to create a garden courtyard, add a new spa, fitness and pool area, exceptional suites, and a “rooftop villa” with a private garden and pool.[15]\n\nCultural depictions\n\n[edit]\n\nMonte Carlo has been the setting of many films, books, television shows, and video games.\n\nFilms\n\n[edit]\n\nFoolish Wives (1922), although it was filmed in California.\n\nRebecca (1940), an Alfred Hitchcock film with Monte Carlo and its famous casino as the setting, starring Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine.\n\nTo Catch a Thief (1954), an Alfred Hitchcock film with Monte Carlo and its famous casino as the setting, starring Cary Grant and Grace Kelly, the future Princess Grace of Monaco.\n\nGrand Prix (1966), starring James Garner, Eva Marie Saint, and Yves Montand.\n\nMonte Carlo or Bust!

I headed up the Data function at London-based Scale-up Codat. I’m now CEO at Orchestra, which is a data release pipeline tool that helps Data Teams release data into production reliably and efficiently 🚀\n\n️️⭐️ Also check out our Substack and our internal blog ⭐️\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe term “Data Observability” really took off as a sector in around 2021 as organisations had too much money and needed a quick and dirty solution to data quality and monitoring.\n\nThat said, the overarching idea with a data collection tool is to ensure that data being used in production has a high degree of “quality”. Quality iself is split into a few different areas. Some of these are accuracy, completeness, normality and well-definition.\n\nI’ve never liked the phrase “Data Quality”. It feels like something an organisation has/prioritises/focuses on but has no definition. By contrast, the above sub-terms are much more concrete and have definitions anyone can understand.\n\nFor example, you might say data is “well-defined” if metrics are calculated accurately. In this case, the revenue displayed in a dashboard corresponds to a definition of it, rather than some erroneous calculation. You might say data is complete if all data points included in a dataset reflect all those in reality.\n\nIn this article, we’ll dive into the architecture and features of the Top Data Observability Tools. We’ll examine how these features relate, not to “data quality” as a whole but to these explicit components of data quality. We’ll also compare pricing.\n\nObservability Tool Architecture\n\nEven the top-performing Gartner Data Observability Tools represent monolithic applications that are generally unrelated to Data Pipeline Architecture as a whole.",
      "# [ATLAS releases 65 TB of open data for research](https://openscience.cern/index.php/node/439)\nThe ATLAS Experiment at CERN has made two years’ worth of scientific data available to the public for research purposes. The data include recordings of proton–proton collisions from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at a collision energy of 13 TeV. This is the first time that ATLAS has released data on this scale, and it marks a significant milestone in terms of public access and utilisation of LHC data.\n\n“Open access is a core value of CERN and the ATLAS Collaboration,” says Andreas Hoecker, ATLAS Spokesperson. “Since its beginning, ATLAS has strived to make its results fully accessible and reusable through open access archives such as arXiv and HepData. ATLAS has routinely released open data for educational purposes. Now, we’re taking it one step further — inviting everyone to explore the data that led to our discoveries.”\n\nReleased under the Creative Commons CC0 waiver, ATLAS has made public all the data collected by the experiment during the 2015 and 2016 proton–proton operation of the LHC. This is approximately 65 TB of data, representing over 7 billion LHC collision events. In addition, ATLAS has released 2 billion events of simulated “Monte Carlo” data, which are essential for carrying out a physics analysis.\n\nExternal researchers, in particular, are encouraged to explore the ATLAS open data. “Along with the data, we have provided comprehensive documentation on several of our analyses, guiding users through our process step-by-step,” says Zach Marshall, ATLAS Computing co-Coordinator. “These guides provide first-hand experience of working on a real ATLAS result, allowing anyone to test our tools, and evaluate the systematic uncertainties associated with the result for themselves.”\n\nATLAS traditionally collaborates with non-ATLAS scientists through short-term associations, granting them full access to ATLAS data, internal tools, and information. Through the open data, ATLAS researchers hope to further nurture this dialogue and collaboration. “In particular,” adds Zach, “we’d like to encourage phenomenologists and also computer scientists to explore our datasets, instead of relying on mock-ups.”\n\nThis release builds upon previous open data releases for educational use (in 2016 and 2020). “All of our open data releases are now available through the ATLAS open data website,” says Dilia Portillo, ATLAS Outreach and Education co-Coordinator. “The website includes multi-level documentation, video tutorials and online tools aimed at the full-spectrum of users, from high school students to senior particle physics researchers. In addition, the software used to create the education-use open data has been released. This provides a seamless transition from the research open data to all the tutorials for outreach and education, including newly updated Higgs-boson discovery documentation. With a bit of time and dedication, you can go from being a relative novice to carrying out your own analysis.”\n\nThe ATLAS open data website also serves as a hub for the community, which includes teachers, students, enthusiasts and, now, scientists. Anyone diving into the open data can also directly engage with ATLAS physicists, who are available to respond to user feedback and take suggestions.\n\nThis release marks the start of more to come, with ATLAS’ first release of lead-lead-nuclei collision data data up next. The ATLAS Collaboration, along with the other main LHC experiment collaborations, has committed to making all of its data publicly accessible after a certain time. Openness is deeply ingrained in the culture of high-energy physics, enabling greater accessibility, reproducibility and better science.\n\nGet started with ATLAS open data:\n\nQuick Start: beginners guide to the 13 TeV dataset released for education. No downloads required.\n\nDeep Dive: more in-depth tutorial designed for students or teachers who want to use ATLAS open data resources over multiple sessions and download data.\n\nResearcher Toolkit: documentation for expert users looking to perform detailed analyses.",
      "# [The Coolest Data Observability And DataOps Companies Of The 2024 Big Data 100 by Rick Whiting](https://www.crn.com/news/software/2024/the-coolest-data-observability-and-dataops-companies-of-the-2024-big-data-100)\nPart 6 of CRN’s Big Data 100 takes a look at the vendors solution providers should know in the data operations and data observability space.\n\nUpon Closer Observation\n\nData teams within businesses and organizations strive to provide internal business users and external customers with analytical insights. But those efforts often fall short because the data and analytic systems and processes that support those initiatives produce low-quality results.\n\nWith so much riding on big data today, problems with data quality and reliability can be as disruptive to business operations as an IT system outage—or worse because the damage may not be discovered until after the fact, such as with a marketing campaign that failed due to faulty data.\n\nData observability tools are focused on the data itself and an organization’s data operations (DataOps) – the flow of data from its source to the end-consumer of analytical results. They monitor and manage the quality and reliability of data, data pipelines and data infrastructure, and are used to investigate and remediate data-related problems. Such efforts are critical for maintaining high-quality data for internal operations, data engineering projects, and for building and operating data products and services.\n\nThis week CRN is running the CRN 2024 Big Data 100 in a series of slide shows, organized by technology category, spotlighting vendors of business analytics software, database systems, data warehouse and data lake systems, data management and integration software, data operations and observability tools, and big data systems and cloud platforms.\n\nHere's a look at 10 companies with products in the data operations and data observability space.\n\nThis list includes vendors who develop data observability tools used to monitor and manage data quality and vendors of observability software primarily used to monitor system performance.\n\nSome vendors have big data product portfolios that span multiple technology categories. They appear in the Big Data 100 slideshow for the technology segment in which they are most prominent.\n\nAcceldata\n\nTop Executive: CEO Rohit Choudhary\n\nAcceldata says its all-in-one observability platform provides insights into data stacks to improve data quality, pipeline reliability, platform performance and spending efficiency across enterprise data systems in the cloud, on premises and in hybrid systems.\n\nIn February Acceldata boosted its data observability offerings with the launch of new AI technology that uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze huge volumes of data for automated anomaly detection, root cause analysis and predictive analytics.\n\nThat followed Acceldata’s September acquisition of AI engine developer Bewgle, a move Acceldata said would allow it to expand its observability capabilities into AI and large language models.\n\nCampbell, Calif.-based Acceldata was founded in 2018.\n\nBigeye\n\nTop Executive: CEO Kyle Kirwan\n\nBigeye’s data observability and data monitoring platform provides enterprise-grade data observability, including AI-driven anomaly detection and comprehensive data lineage, for both modern and legacy data stacks.\n\nBigeye was founded in 2019 by CEO Kyle Kirwan and CTO Egor Gryaznov who both worked at Uber on the data pipelines for the company’s in-house A/B testing tool.\n\nIn December Bigeye received a strategic investment from data analytics platform company Alteryx. The amount was undisclosed, but Bigeye said it brought its total funding to $68.5 million.\n\nCribl\n\nTop Executive: CEO Clint Sharp\n\nCribl describes its technology as “the data engine for IT and security.” The company’s product portfolio, including Cribl Stream, Cribl Edge and Cribl Search, collects data from any source, processes billions of events per second, automatically routes data to optimize storage, and analyzes the data.\n\nEarlier this month Cribl launched Cribl Lake, a turnkey data lake system that is provisioned from Cribl.Cloud and allows IT and security teams to collect and control their data.\n\nIn March San Francisco-based Cribl said the startup recorded “record-breaking” growth in annual recurring revenue, triple-digit customer growth, more than 140 percent net dollar retention, and greater adoption of Crible.Cloud and its multi-product suite of data management software.\n\nDataKitchen\n\nTop Executive: CEO Christopher Bergh\n\nDataKitchen says its DataOps software provides a way for data and analytic teams to observe complex end-to-end processes, generate and execute tests, and validate data, tools, processes and environments across their entire data analytics organizations.\n\nDataKitchen, based in Lexington, Mass., develops its DataOps Observability, DataOps Automation and DataOps TestGen software for data production teams and data science and data engineering professionals.\n\nGrafana Labs\n\nTop Executive: CEO Raj Dutt\n\nGrafana Labs develops data observability, monitoring and visualization software, offering many of the tools on an open-source basis as well as in commercial Grafana Enterprise and Grafana Cloud editions. The products are based on the open-source Prometheus tool for monitoring systems and services.\n\nEarlier this month Grafana Labs, based in New York, debuted Grafana 11.0 with a new Explore Metric capability for identifying a problem’s root cause. The release also provides improved visualizations, simpler alerting and support for additional data sources.\n\nThe company also launched Grafana Alloy, the company’s distribution of the open-source OpenTelemetry software.\n\nMonte Carlo\n\nTop Executive: CEO Barr Moses\n\nMonte Carlo’s Data Observability Platform is an end-to-end system for monitoring data stacks and providing alerts for data issues across data warehouses, data lakes, ETL (extract, transform and load) systems and business analytics tools.\n\nThe system automatically and immediately identifies the root cause of data problems using machine learning-based incident monitoring and resolution capabilities.\n\nMonte Carlo and Fivetran, developer of a cloud-based automated data movement platform, recently collaborated to integrate their software, allowing organizations that use both products to better monitor data quality at time of ingestion.\n\nMonte Carlo, based in San Francisco, raised $135 million in Series D funding in May 2022.\n\nSplunk\n\nTop Executive: EVP and General Manager Gary Steele\n\nSplunk has been one of the long-time leaders in data observability with its platform for collecting, indexing and managing machine-generated data.\n\nSplunk offers Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud Platform for working with machine data. In addition, it provides a number of specific tools for observability and security – the two most popular use cases for the Splunk platform.\n\nOn March 18 networking tech giant Cisco Systems completed its $28 billion acquisition of Splunk.

      "# [Introducing: Alerts](https://docs.getmontecarlo.com/docs/introducing-alerts)\nOn June 4 2024, the current state of \"Incidents\" in Monte Carlo will be repurposed as \"Alerts.\" The current use of \"Severity\" will also split into \"Priority\" for Monitors and Alerts, and \"Severity\" will remain as the way to mark an Alert as an Incident.\n\nWhy the change?\n\nWe heard clearly from our customers that not every alert/notification from MC is an \"Incident.\" We also know that reporting and retrospectives on \"alerts\" is not always necessary, but these activities on true data incidents are critical to the success of data teams.\n\nWe're better aligning Monte Carlo to accepted industry tooling and terminology: triage alerts and escalate them to incidents where it makes sense, report on those incidents, and communicate them out to stakeholders if appropriate.\n\nWhat is changing?\n\nSummary\n\n\"Incidents\" today become \"Alerts\" going forward.\n\nCustom Monitors can have a pre-set \"Priority,\" replacing the pre-set \"Severity\" today.\n\n\"Priority\" from a Custom Monitor is inherited to an Alert, but is not changeable on the Alert.\n\n\"Alerts\" can be marked as \"Incidents\" by utilizing \"Severity.\" This workflow will be further improved in the coming weeks.\n\nThe \"investigating\" status has been renamed to \"acknowledged\" in the UI, Slack, and MS Teams.\n\nDetails & Impacts of Changes\n\nIn this first release, the following may require customer action:\n\nThe names of insights reports are changing and may require action if you have scripted programs to extract them.\n\nincident_history to alert_history: the former will continue to exist for now, but is considered deprecated and replaced with alert_history. The new insight contains columns referencing alert_* rather than incident_*. It also contains the new priority field that is inherited from the Monitor.\n\nEvents (events.csv): the Severity field will no longer be populated. The Priority field will be populated going forward if inheriting a monitor priority.\n\nRule Results (rule_results.csv): the alert_id field was added. The incident_id still exists but is considered deprecated.\n\nPast Alerts will be backfilled with Priority values if the past Alert (Incident) had a Severity marked. No past Alerts (Incidents) will be marked with a Severity. If reporting off of Severity outside of Monte Carlo using our insights, Snowflake Data Share, or our API, you will need to leverage the Priority field going forward.\n\nIf you leverage the API to retrieve Severity today, we recommend starting to use Priority going forward. The existing Severity field will not be immediately deprecated.\n\nIf reporting off of Severity outside of Monte Carlo using our insights, Snowflake Data Share, or our API, you should to leverage the Priority field going forward.\n\nIn this first release, the following additional changes will be made, which should not require customer action:\n\nAround the application, the word \"Incident\" has generally been fully replaced with \"Alert.\"\n\nWhen creating a Custom Monitor, instead of setting a Severity of SEV-0 through SEV-4, you can now set a Priority of P1 through P5.\n\nFor any existing Monitors as Code, Monte Carlo will automatically map these Severities to Priorities.\n\nAPI has both \"severity” and “priority” for now. Updating monitor “severity” via API updates monitor “priority” for backwards compatibility.\n\nWhen an Alert is created, the Alert will inherit the Priority of the Custom Monitor (replacing the inheritance of Severity).\n\nWhen an Alert is created, the Alert will not inherit any Severity. Severity now must be marked by a user, implying that this Alert constituted a true Incident.\n\nDashboards and Alerts can be filtered by Priority.\n\nThe URLs for /incidents will be remapped to /alerts but any existing bookmarks will automatically forward to the new URLs.\n\nThe \"investigating\" status has been renamed to \"acknowledged\" in the UI, Slack, and MS Teams. The\n\nComing soon:\n\nChanges to the incident response flow: ability to mark Incidents in the UI and notification applications like Slack and MS Teams.\n\nFiltering by Severity in addition to Priority around the application.\n\nWhat actions must customers take?\n\nBreaking changes:\n\nIf leveraging the API to extract Insights Reports, the names of the reports x and y are changing and may cause scripts to break that are extracting these insights. We are separately reaching out to users that are extracting these today to communicate this change directly.\n\nIf reporting off of Severity outside of Monte Carlo using our insights, Snowflake Data Share, or our API, you will need to leverage the Priority field going forward. The Severity field now is used differently.\n\nIn future:\n\nFor any monitors-as-code users, pre-set Severity values may need to eventually be mapped to Priority values as this may cause confusion for customers. Monte Carlo will not enforce this change in the immediate future and will map them as noted above.\n\nFor any external reporting on \"investigating\" status, use the acknowledged status going forward. This has not yet been renamed in the insights reports or API.\n\nWhat is not yet changing?\n\nIn this first release:\n\nThe Monte Carlo API will not be affected. Customers and Partners can still use the Incidents related APIs. This will change in the coming months but we will provide an additional cutover plan well before deprecating any legacy APIs.\n\nThe statuses of Alerts.\n\nTimeline\n\nThe target date for the application terminology to change is June 4, 2024. Additional changes are targeted in June and July.\n\nResources & Support\n\nPlease reach out through your usual support channels if you have you have any questions or concerns and we can ensure they are prioritized quickly during this change.",
