      "# [Delivering End-to-End Data Trust with Snowflake and Monte Carlo by Scott O'Leary on 2021-04-29](https://www.montecarlodata.com/blog-snowflake/)\nAs companies increasingly leverage data-driven insights to drive innovation and maintain their competitive edge, it’s important that this data is accurate and reliable. With Monte Carlo and Snowflake’s strategic partnership, teams can finally trust their data through end-to-end Data Observability and automated lineage of their entire data ecosystem, all the way down to field-level values.\n\nHas your CEO ever told you that the numbers in a report you showed her looked way off?\n\nHas a customer ever called out errors in your product’s dashboards?\n\nWhat about a rise in a field’s null rate that went unnoticed for days or weeks because there wasn’t a noticeable change in your KPIs?\n\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, you’re not alone. Data downtime, in other words, periods of time when data is missing, inaccurate, or otherwise erroneous, is an all-too-familiar reality for even the best data teams, costing them millions of dollars in wasted revenue and up to 50 percent of the data engineering team’s time that could otherwise be spent moving the needle for the business.\n\nTo help companies trust their data, Monte Carlo is excited to announce our partnership with Snowflake by bringing our automated Data Observability Platform to the Data Cloud. Data teams relying on Snowflake to derive critical insights about their business can now leverage the power of automated anomaly detection, monitoring, and end-to-end lineage to prevent bad data from affecting downstream consumers.\n\nAchieving reliable Snowflake pipelines with data observability\n\nThe Snowflake – Monte Carlo integration makes it easy for data organizations to identify, resolve, and prevent data downtime and data quality issues before they impact the business, giving companies confidence in the reliability of their data and the products they power.\n\nWith this partnership, Snowflake customers can now:\n\nAchieve end-to-end Data Observability without writing any code. Get end-to-end data observability for your Snowflake data pipelines with a 20-minute, no-code implementation process. Access out-of-the-box visibility into data Freshness, Volume, Distribution, Schema, and Lineage just by plugging Monte Carlo into your Data Cloud.\n\nKnow when data breaks, as soon as it happens. Monte Carlo continuously monitors your Snowflake assets and proactively alerts stakeholders to data issues. Monte Carlo’s machine learning-first approach gives data teams broad coverage for common data issues with minimal configuration, and business-context-specific checks layered on top ensure you’re covered at each stage of your data pipeline.\n\nFind the root cause of data quality issues, fast. Monte Carlo gives teams a single pane of glass to investigate data issues, drastically reducing time to resolution. By bringing all information and context for your pipelines into one place, teams spend less time firefighting data issues and more time improving the business.\n\nImmediately understand the business impact of bad data. End-to-end lineage for your pipelines from the point it enters Snowflake (or further upstream!) down to the analytics and business intelligence layer, data teams are able to assess the business impact of their data issues, ultimately preventing decision making based on bad data.\n\nPrevent data downtime. Give your teams full visibility into your Snowflake pipelines and how they impact downstream reports and dashboards to make more informed development decisions. With Monte Carlo, teams can better manage breaking changes to ELTs and BI assets by knowing what will be impacted and who to notify.\n\nIn addition to supporting existing mutual customers, Monte Carlo provides end-to-end, automated coverage for teams migrating from their legacy stacks to the Snowflake Data Cloud Platform. Moreover, Monte Carlo’s security-first approach to Data Observability ensures that data never leaves your Snowflake environment.\n\nWhat Monte Carlo and Snowflake customers have to say\n\nThe Zebra\n\nThe Zebra, a leading insurance comparison site, makes it easy for consumers across the United States to compare and save on car and home insurance quotes. The company provides over 1,800 car insurance products from more than 200 national insurers, a monumental feat that relies on real-time decision making powered by data from disparate third-party vendors and partners. The Zebra’s data team uses Snowflake and Monte Carlo to ensure that their data pipelines are performant and reliable.\n\n“As a data leader, there’s nothing worse than not being able to trust your data,” said Shea Spalding, Head of Data Governance at The Zebra. “The combination of Snowflake’s data cloud and Monte Carlo’s data observability platform helps ensure that our data is accessible and fresh at each stage of the data life cycle. With this stack, my team can better collaborate to resolve issues, work towards data trust, and build better products for our customers.”\n\nMindbody\n\nAs the world’s leading wellness services marketplace, Mindbody is a company with data at heart. Alex Soria, VP of Data & Analytics, is leading the charge with a team of over 25 data scientists, business intelligence analysts, and data engineers responsible for ensuring that the insights powering their product is fresh and reliable.\n\nAs the world’s leading wellness services marketplace, Mindbody is a company with data at heart. Alex Soria, VP of Data & Analytics, is leading the charge with a team of over 25 data scientists, business intelligence analysts, and data engineers responsible for ensuring that the insights powering their product is fresh and reliable.\n\n“Data-driven decision making is a huge priority for Mindbody, but our analytics are only as reliable as the data that informs them,” said Alex. “We are working with Monte Carlo to monitor and alert for abnormalities in our Snowflake pipelines, such as null values and duplicate data, that would otherwise go unnoticed until it’s too late. By partnering with Snowflake and Monte Carlo, my team can achieve more powerful analytics and full data reliability.”\n\nCollaborative Imaging\n\nCollaborative Imaging is a radiologist-owned alliance dedicated to improving the lives of physicians and patients everywhere through technology. With over 18,000 patients seen per day and nearly 1M radiological exams read per month, the alliance is charting a course for the future of this industry by giving providers the solutions and processes necessary to better serve their communities.\n\nTo power their business, Collaborative Imaging needs fast analytics powered by clean and reliable data, which is no easy feat given the size and scope of their distributed data ecosystem. To gain greater visibility into the health of their data at each stage of its life cycle, they needed a way to understand how data flows into their data warehouse, as well as be alerted when changes occur in schema or distribution of the many data sources which are ingested into their Snowflake data warehouse. Monte Carlo empowered them to troubleshoot and resolve issues before downstream data consumers are impacted.\n\n“Collaborative Imaging’s analytics platform helps physicians and patients connect the dots between disparate data points in their healthcare journey, but our insights are only as reliable as the data feeding our system. Dirty data is a landmark of healthcare analytics, and a lot of the work we do revolves around cleaning and making sense of this data to put it into one repository,” said Jacob. “Combined with Snowflake’s powerful Data Cloud and Monte Carlo’s Data Observability Platform, we can resolve these problems before they reach the business. My executives are happy and I can trust our data.”\n\nWant to learn more about how data observability can help you trust your data?

Additionally, our customers and your employer must prevent unauthorized access to accounts and Personal Information by selecting and protecting passwords appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser.\n\nHow Is My Personal Information Retained?\n\nWe keep Personal Information as long as it is necessary or relevant for the purposes for which it was collected and in compliance with our retention policies. We also keep information as otherwise required by law.\n\nTo determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider not only applicable legal requirements, but also the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Information, the purposes for which we process your Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means.\n\nWhat Choices Do I Have Regarding My Personal Information?\n\nYou can choose not to disclose Personal Information to us, but keep in mind that if you are a customer or an employee of a customer, some Personal Information may be needed to register with us or to take advantage of some of our Service features.\n\nIf Personal Information covered by this Privacy Policy is to be used for a new purpose that is materially different from that for which the Personal Information was originally collected or subsequently authorized, or is to be disclosed to a non-agent third party in a manner not specified in this Privacy Policy, Monte Carlo will provide you with an opportunity to choose whether to have our Personal Information so used or disclosed. Requests to opt-out of such uses or disclosures of Personal Information should be sent to us at privacy@montecarlodata.com.\n\nCertain Personal Information, such as information about medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, is considered “sensitive information.” Monte Carlo will not use sensitive information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you unless we have received your affirmative and explicit consent (opt-in).\n\nTo stop receiving our promotional emails follow the instructions in any promotional message you get from us or contact us as described at the end of this Privacy Policy. If you opt out of getting marketing messages, you will continue to receive messages from us about your relationship with us where permitted by law.\n\nYou may request deletion of your information or account by sending a request to privacy@montecarlodata.com. If you are an employee of one of our customers, we will refer your request to that Monte Carlo customer. Some information may remain in our records after your deletion request.\n\nYou can control cookies and tracking tools. To learn how we - and our vendors - use cookies and other tracking tools, and to read our Do Not Track policy, please click here.\n\nYour Legal Rights Regarding Your Personal Information\n\nUnder certain circumstances you may have rights under applicable data protection laws in relation to your Personal Information. Where applicable, you may have the right to:\n\nRequest information about how we collect, process, use and share your Personal Information (commonly known as a “right to know request”).\n\nRequest access to your Personal Data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.\n\nRequest correction of the Personal Information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.\n\nRequest erasure of your Personal Information (commonly known as a “request to be forgotten”). This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Information. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your Personal Information to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply in full with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.\n\nObject to processing of your Personal Information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.\n\nRequest restriction of processing of your Personal Information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Information in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.\n\nRequest the transfer of your Personal Information to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.\n\nWithdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain Services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.\n\nIf you wish to exercise any of the above rights please contact privacy@montecarlodata.com. You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of the other rights), and Monte Carlo does not discriminate based on whether you choose to exercise your choice and rights. We will not, based on your exercise of rights, deny our Services to you, charge you different rates, provide a different level or quality of Services to you, or suggest that you may receive such different treatment. However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.\n\nAdditionally, we may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. As part of the verification process, we match the information submitted as part of your request against information stored by Monte Carlo. In some instances, we will require additional information in order to verify your request. If an authorized third party makes a data subject request on your behalf, we will require sufficient written proof that you have designated them as your authorized agent. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within 30 days. Occasionally it may take us longer than 30 days if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.\n\nCalifornia Residents’ Rights\n\nSubject to certain limitations, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides California consumers the right to request to know more details about the categories or specific pieces of Personal Information we collect (including how we use and disclose this information), to delete their Personal Information, to opt out of any “sales” that may be occurring, and to not be discriminated against for exercising these rights. If you are a resident of California (or another jurisdiction that provides comparable rights) and would like to make a request, please contact us 548 Market Street, PMB 59994, San Francisco, CA 94104 or via email at privacy@montecarlodata.com. If you are submitting on someone else’s behalf, we may ask for additional information to verify your identity. This may include providing a signed letter verifying your right to make this request. We do not sell Personal Information to third parties for money or any other consideration, as that term is generally understood. We do not sell Personal Information of minors under the age of 16. We will not discriminate against you because you have exercised any of your rights under the CCPA.\n\nFor EU, UK and Swiss Residents\n\nIf Personal Information pertaining to you as an individual has been submitted to the Services by or on behalf of one of our customers and you wish to exercise any data protection rights you may have in respect of that data under applicable law, including (as applicable) the right to access, port, correct, amend or delete such data, please inquire with the relevant Monte Carlo customer directly. We have a limited ability to access the content of our customers. However, if you wish to make your request directly to us, please provide the name of the Monte Carlo customer who submitted your data to our Services. We will refer your request to that Monte Carlo customer.\n\nData Privacy Framework Statement\n\nMonte Carlo complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. This includes with respect to Personal Information provided to us by our customers for processing on behalf of the customer in the provision of our Services.\n\nMonte Carlo has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of Personal Information transferred from the European Union and the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar), and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of Personal Information transferred from Switzerland. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/.\n\nMonte Carlo uses third party subprocessors to help us provide our Services and those subprocessors may process Personal Information. If you are an EU, UK or Swiss individual, where we transfer your Personal Information to a third party subprocessor, we are responsible for the processing of that Personal Information by them and shall remain responsible and liable under the DPF Principles for our third party subprocessors as set forth in the DPF Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.\n\nEU, UK and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of Personal Information received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, should first contact Monte Carlo at: privacy@montecarlodata.com. In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, Monte Carlo commits to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of Personal Information to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit https://www.jamsadr.com/dpf-dispute-resolution for more information or to file a complaint. The services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you. Under certain conditions, as further explained in the DPF Principles, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted. Monte Carlo is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, Monte Carlo may be required to disclose Personal Information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.\n\nOur Services Are Not Intended For Children\n\nWe do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at privacy@montecarlodata.com.\n\nThird Party Sites And Services\n\nIf you click on a link to a third party website or service, a third party may also transmit cookies to you. Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t responsible for their privacy policies and practices. Please be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third parties may not honor “Do Not Track” requests you have set using your browser or device.\n\nUpdates To This Privacy Policy\n\nWe may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes to our Privacy Policy as required by law. We will also post an updated copy on the sites where this appears. Please check our site periodically for updates.",
      "# [Monte Carlo by Lior Gavish on 2025-01-30](https://www.montecarlodata.com/about-us/)\nDeliver on the promise of data + AI\n\nIn 2025, 100 percent of data leaders feel pressure to build GenAI, but only 68 percent don’t believe they’re AI-ready.\n\nThe culprit? Data downtime. Plaguing even some of the most data-driven enterprises, data downtime – when data is missing, inaccurate, or otherwise unreliable. While great tools existed to identify and resolve infrastructure issues, there was no easy way to guarantee the trust of data and AI pipelines.\n\nWith the proliferation of AI, the data estate has changed but the way we solve for data quality hasn’t. Until now.\n\nAI + data observability, an industry-defining approach to finding and fixing data issues at scale. AI-ready starts with trusted data. Trusted data starts with Monte Carlo."

It plugs into the data stack, collects metadata, metrics and logs and provides visibility into data health. Lots of stuff works out of the box so we didn't have to customize it too much to get coverage for our pipelines.

If I don't receive data in a 24 hour span with those data sources I have alerts built in to notify my entire team via slack.\n\nI also use PowerBI to create data quality scorecards. Field by field I show how many unique values there are, how many nulls, latest date populated, - this is done table by table for new data sources and then just exists for periodic review as needed.\n\nAudits of source systems vs the Data Warehouse should occur on some cadence your team can realistically meet regardless of any data obs tool you use.

I really recommend these lectures. He's a fantastic teacher. This is his current semester, so it's not yet complete. Previous years' courses are also available if you outpace his output. \n\nMC methods are surprisingly powerful for how simple they are, conceptually. Firstly, they can replace the ocean of test statistics that you have to grapple with using frequentist methods. With a single process you can do pretty much any hypothesis test without basing the overall assessment of the hypothesis on an arbitrary cutoff point like alpha=5%.\n\nYou can incorporate domain knowledge in your models. If, for example, you know that a parameter *has* to be positive (because it's a count of some real world thing) and also should probably be somewhere between 5 and 10, and is very unlikely to be 10,000 you can include this in your model even if you don't have any data for it.\n\nMC methods also let you design relationships between variables, let you get information about unobserved quantities that either affect or are affected by observed quantities, can be used as part of a causal analysis, can give you a tool for simulating a contra-positive (what would have happened otherwise), can give you highly explainable results, can work on smaller data sets, can give you not only point estimates but credible intervals (which are much more intuitive to non-technical people than confidence intervals are).\n\n### Comment ID j5ztk8k with +1 score by [(Coco_Dirichlet, Reddit, 2023-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10ljew2/monte_carlo_simulation/j5ztk8k/) (in reply to ID j5yyfh4):\nMCMC is not the same as MC\n\n## Comment ID j5ylvf6 with +3 score by [(OneSprinkles6720, Reddit, 2023-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10ljew2/monte_carlo_simulation/j5ylvf6/) (in reply to ID 10ljew2):\nMonte carlo gives me guidelines I can use to yank a financial markets trading algo out of production.

The process had a significant amount of manufacturing data across multiple manufacturing sites but there was significant variability between unit operations and sites.  Pulling all the data together for each unit operation, I determined the distributions and then used the MC at each unit operation to predict the probability of mfg times exceeding the maximum allowed and if said times would result in significant thermal degradation.   This is a high level description but hopefully you get the idea of what the use case was.\n\n## Comment ID j6001fc with +1 score by [(Coco_Dirichlet, Reddit, 2023-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10ljew2/monte_carlo_simulation/j6001fc/) (in reply to ID 10ljew2):\nThe simplest reason to use Monte Carlo simulation is that you fit a model (e.g. logistic regression) and you want to calculate predictions for a range of values of one of the variables. How do you calculate the uncertainty for those predictions/predicted probabilities? Well, the easiest way to go about it is by doing MC simulation because in non-linear models, the uncertainty for each prediction is going to change for each value of X.\n\nYou can also use Monte Carlo simulations for cross-validation.\n\nYou can also use Monte Carlo simulations when you are comparing a series of different models performance, on average, with a lot of data you simulated (fake data) that has a particular problem (e.g. heteroskedastic data, or serially correlated data).\n\nAnd can people in the comments spot implying MCMC is the same as MC. It's not! MCMC includes an MC, but OP asked about MC. They aren't used for the same problems. If you take a Bayesian Stats course, you'll cover MCMC but MC is just going to be a tiny part of the course.  \n\nThere are several books that are *only* on Monte Carlo simulations. I have several I got for courses I took in grad school. If you want to learn about it, getting an applied book that's specifically about it is useful.\n\nI don't know what people are talking about on Twitter. Twitter is shit. That said, in general courses don't focus a lot on the presentation of results/prediction/visualization/explanation, and MC is used a lot on that area. Books usually stop once you fit the model, maybe have some basic table, a one summary explanation of the results (and it's usually something like this goes up, this goes down), the end.\n\n### Comment ID j61k284 with +1 score by [(MrAce2C, Reddit, 2023-01-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10ljew2/monte_carlo_simulation/j61k284/) (in reply to ID j6001fc):\nHi!

That's usually in conjunction with a user story mapping process (Jeff Patton), and harks back to how Extreme Programming (XP) worked.   \n  \nAs soon as access to the customer becomes a constraint, you'll tend to slide towards larger \"batch sizes\" and the need for more \"upstream\" product discovery and \"downstream\" UAT and feedback.  \n  \nIn those cases you tend to move from the \"thin slice of value\" model and decompose the \"big\" work into things that are more work-flow or task oriented, based on the \"up front requirements\"   \n  \nIt's not super agile, because the big batch sizes will still tend to mean an \"inspect and rework\" approach to quality (in a \"built the right thing\" sense)   \n  \nHowever it's also not really waterfall, as you will still be doing all the agile \"build the thing right\" stuff around CI/CD, automated testing, agile test quadrants and even stuff like TDD and pairing.\n\nThat said, I'd counsel it's really down to the team in terms of how they want to self-manage the work.  The data they are tracking should help them to locate bottlenecks and continuously improve how they are delivering.  \n  \nIt's also up to the business how they want to control investment risk.  The bigger the batch size, the greater the sunk-costs, and the more you stand to lose if you are wrong about what customers value.  \n  \nIf you have the access to capital that supports the size of bet you are making, then that's okay.

MC simulation achieved better results.\n* One of the most subtle, but best things about moving to something like MC simulation is the introduction of probability into forecasts. You no longer communicate: \"Yeah, we'll be done on Feb 30. We think.\" and move to \"We'll be finished on Feb 30, x% of the time\" where x is your risk tolerance.\n* A lot of people make a big deal about sample set. I found that 10 pieces of cycle time/throughput data was sufficient to start generating results.\n* While small, same sized stories can help, I found you can still use MC simulation without working on story size. What a backlog with same sized stories will do is \"narrow\" the distribution curve of throughput results, which will reduce the impact of risk levels on the forecast. Forecasts with randomly sized stories are still valid, but changes in risk tolerance will produce a wider range of results.\n* Some semblance of control over cycle time, and thus throughput, is more important than story size, imo. But you really shouldn't be saying you're using kanban if you're not controlling WIP.\n* You'll need to prune your data set. Obvious outliers should be thrown away. You probably want a horizon for the data so you're biased towards more recent results. And, of course, fundamental changes to critical things like team composition, etc can render previous forecasts unreliable.\n\n### Comment ID lkk3skz with +3 score by [(mippzon, Reddit, 2024-08-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/agile/comments/1f4akow/you_experience_with_monte_carlo_simulation_in/lkk3skz/) (in reply to ID lkjzn6p):\nThanks for an extensive answer!

I believe it might be a plugin for Jira now??\n* Even with expert Kanban teams, you might find yourself with a story/ticket that gets put on hold due to some emergency, or because someone is sick and there's no one to pick it up, or life just generally intervenes. For example, a ticket might get started before Christmas, just not get finished before the break, and sit there until the new year. Yeah, with enough brain sweat we could have probably come up with a good enough adjusted cycle time, but we just didn't want to bother. One of the things we wanted from the MC approach was just less handling of stories. \n* I'm not sure what you're asking for in terms of variance. Do you mean what's the farthest we've missed a forecast? Or how much the forecast varies based on risk? \n   * If it's the latter, then yeah, some of our forecasts generated with small data sets had great sensitivity to risk level. That's the one advantage of a larger data set and/or smaller stories. \n   * If it's the former, we tended to set quarterly releases to customers, so we'd use a \"How many\" simulation to tell the PO how many stories they could reasonably pick from the product backlog. We were generally within 10% of the forecasted # of stories while velocity wasn't as accurate (plus velocity generally deals with averages, which is essentially a coin toss). \n\nHope that answers your questions.\n\n### Comment ID lkw06s0 with +1 score by [(AskGroundbreaking124, Reddit, 2024-08-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/agile/comments/1f4akow/you_experience_with_monte_carlo_simulation_in/lkw06s0/) (in reply to ID lkjzn6p):\nNice!\n\nSince you mentioned User Story size, I would be very grateful if you could share your view in a situation I have already shared in other comment.\n\nI have just joined a startup that is all into Kanban, using Monte Carlo and stuff but their Work Item is Tasks (like technical ones, frontend, backend and stuff), they jump from epics right to technical tasks, and then all the metrics and simulations a are applied in this task level.\n\nIs does not make any sense to me.\nI believe the right level to estimate, simulate and get metrics would be User Stories, I am right?\n\nIf so, how do the devs breakdown the user stories and track them in the board?\n\nThanks for any advice!\n\n#### Comment ID lkx1w9j with +1 score by [(DingBat99999, Reddit, 2024-09-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/agile/comments/1f4akow/you_experience_with_monte_carlo_simulation_in/lkx1w9j/) (in reply to ID lkw06s0):\nI guess the first question is: Is it working?

I think you need to frame the method in knowing that a huge part of the practical application of mathematics before the 20th century involved manually computing different functions. \n\nHuge reference works of tables were produced of sines and cosines of different angles and the digits of pi to offload computation time for precise calculations. Some mathematicians spent years creating these kinds of tables. It's been argued that some of Newton's discoveries were the probable result of him seeing patterns in the huge numbers of manual computations that he used to do. Yes, even 'serious' people like Newton did this kind of thing.\n\nConceptually, an abacus is analogous to a computer. It's just offloading computation onto a physical process. Disregarding the technical breakthroughs of the transistor and the miniaturization of electronics, a computer is, conceptually, just finding a way to have calculations be done by the universe, through moving electrons around, rather than doing them by hand on a piece of paper. However, just by doing this very simple thing more quickly you are able to create entirely new fields, like computer graphics, that would be unthinkable in a paradigm where calculations have to be done by hand.\n\nSimilarly, the realization that: \"all of these problems that we can't solve analytically, I think we can solve them numerically by setting up a situation where a device will just 'spit out the correct answer'\" was pretty brilliant. Sure, this idea is somewhat obvious once advanced computers are established as an existing thing, but Ulam invented the method in the infancy of computers. Before computers, this kind of approach would have been unthinkable. If your issue is that \"Ulam shouldn't get so much credit because anyone could have come up with the idea once computers became established\" then maybe you're correct. But disregarding the question of credit and just considering the method itself, doesn't it almost send chills down your spine that we can just set up a system correctly and then have it give us the answer to a question that we would have no way of finding out the answer to on our own?\n\n### Comment ID kppannf with +48 score by [(rhubarb_man, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kppannf/) (in reply to ID kpp8ns6):\nI see, thank you.

With just a bit of computing power you can get a long way without any real understanding of what you're studying.

Some of these stunning applications come in theory CS, particularly in counting or sampling from a set of combinatorial structures. The MCMC method runs riot here.\n\nOne example which I have directly worked on is the uniform sampling of proper colorings of a graph. Note that the set of all colorings, proper and improper, with k colors of a graph with n vertices is exponentially large. What you want to do however is produce a uniform sample from the set of proper colorings, i.e., colorings which impart two different colors across any edge of the graph. This set is exponentially smaller than the set of all colorings, and it is unstructured. So we have absolutely no clue how to produce a uniform sample from this set other than the Monte Carlo method. \n\nAnother interesting example is sampling independent sets of a graph. Note that usually this is a very hard problem. However, using the MCMC method we discovered that there is a range of parameters for which this sampling is easy, and beyond a certain threshold suddenly becomes hard in the NP hard sense. It turns out this threshold is related to the physics of phase transitions of certain models of magnetism! \n\nOther places where deep insights have been gleaned from this technique is the theory of expanders  which finds use in everything from modelling large networks to error correcting codes. \n\nThere are literally reams of literature dedicated to this line of work in theory CS, each more surprising than the last. \n\nI hope this answer helps somewhat.\n\n## Comment ID kpoxxzt with +3 score by [(CatOfGrey, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kpoxxzt/) (in reply to ID 1amy1gh):\nWhat makes Monte Carlo interesting for me, is that it can be used to model outcomes based on non-standard distributions.\n\nIn my practice, I have done Monte Carlo work with survey data.

Sometimes though, it's just not possible, or at least beyond my ability, or just too time consuming to attempt. When those problems arise I can use a Monte Carlo approach, and suddenly I don't have to worry so much about conjugate priors, parameter covariances, correlated variables, etc.\n\nInstead, I just build a model of the physical system I care about (this can be arbitrarily complicated, like a ray trace model of the Hubble Space Telescope), and randomly perturb some parameters and measure some outputs, a million times over.

I have an answer to my question, with the full accuracy of the physical model, without a PhD thesis effort to build a valid analytical model of the whole mess.\n\n## Comment ID kpq9y5r with +2 score by [(archpawn, Reddit, 2024-02-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kpq9y5r/) (in reply to ID 1amy1gh):\n[Relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/2042/)\n\n## Comment ID kpqwryu with +2 score by [(Aurhim, Reddit, 2024-02-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kpqwryu/) (in reply to ID 1amy1gh):\nI like to pretend that its name is the \"Monte Christo\" method, and that it is out for revenge against all the other integration methods that wronged it (Riemann sums, the trapezoid rule, Simpson's rule, etc.).\n\n## Comment ID kpov55d with +2 score by [(RightProfile0, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kpov55d/) (in reply to ID 1amy1gh):\nThe answer is, It's not very interesting but rather essential tools in computing\n\n## Comment ID kpory5m with +1 score by [(Integralcel, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kpory5m/) (in reply to ID 1amy1gh):\nW question\n\n### Comment ID kpoy78v with +7 score by [(WWWWWWVWWWWWWWVWWWWW, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kpoy78v/) (in reply to ID kpory5m):\nW answer:\n\nOP chose the simplest possible case, so of course it feels elementary.

Right now, we know general/Newtonian physics and then things get more hairy from there once our object of study becomes smaller. If we precisely knew, or at least the equations of, every possible chemical reactions down to the most granular level of matter, then we can predict everything in theory. \n\nBut even then just knowing the equation does not give the formula for the solutions, let alone existence directly. All the deterministic methods we have, i.e., numerical methods, usually require us to know enough about the equation to make reasonable approximations. However, when we do not even know the equations and all we have is just observations, then the Monte Carlo methods can help us. \n\nIt's not clear from the simple coin toss example but it's evident when you learn just a little bit of Reinforcement Learning. The big breakthrough that RL brought us in the field of AI stuff like beating Chess, Go, Starcraft, Dota, or Protein folding, self-driving cars are all founded on that simple idea of *repeatedly sampling from your environment* until you learn enough. Note that I am entirely discarding more traditional areas like numerical integration, but that's not to mean MC was not helpful there. \n\nIt's a bit simplistic but if we take the existence or invention of computers granted, then we owe much of modern scientific advances on modern AI to that silly little idea of \"flipping a coin bunch of times.\"\n\n## Comment ID kpr8q61 with +1 score by [(512165381, Reddit, 2024-02-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kpr8q61/) (in reply to ID 1amy1gh):\nApplications\n\n- it can be used in calculus https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_integration\n\n- it IS used in quantitative finance https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_methods_in_finance\n\n- it IS used in pricing financial options https://blog.skz.dev/monte-carlo-options-pricing\n\n> Have people not been doing it for millennia?\n\nProbably, but now we do it via computer.\n\n## Comment ID kprbudd with +1 score by [(gutshog, Reddit, 2024-02-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kprbudd/) (in reply to ID 1amy1gh):\nthis math not mathmemes\n\n## Comment ID kprkejh with +1 score by [(tpn86, Reddit, 2024-02-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kprkejh/) (in reply to ID 1amy1gh):\nThe price of a financial asset is an expectation.

That doesn't mean everything is high quality, it means you make explicit what you do promise. If that's nothing, fine as long as your stakeholders are happy.

Writing the YAML takes work, but this seems like a situation with a well-defined endpoint.\n\ndbt tests, as nice as they are for some use cases (like validating uniqueness, referential integrity, nullness) aren't ideal here. I don't believe you can use dbt tests outside of dbt models.\n\n**Holistic framework for data profiling**: For the future goal of improving data quality in general, I'd recommend looking at tools that help you:\n\n1. Use tests with dynamic thresholds. Metadata like row counts change frequently, so static expectations will need to be updated.\n2. Bulk add tests across your data warehouse to cover \"unknown unknowns\" in addition to known issues.\n3. Include lineage to help you identify downstream impact and upstream root causes.\n\nThe industry is converging on the term \"data observability\" to describe tools that do these three things.

You don't need a framework to get started, for many of my projects, I tested data quality with simple assert statements (check for NAs, values within range, etc); this kind of testing is static since it doesn't take into account previous values, but it works great as an initial step.\n\nWhat you mentioned about comparing old vs new tables is the next natural step, a sudden increase in NAs (say goes from 1% to 10%) may hint problems with the pipeline. This type of testing falls under the umbrella of observability.\n\nFinally, don't forget unit tests. They are the first line of defense and should be fast to run (data quality tests involve running your pipeline with the full dataset, so they take a while).\n\nFor a more complete treatment of this matter, check out a [blog post](https://ploomber.io/blog/ci-for-ds/) I wrote.\n\n## Comment ID hytac7v with +1 score by [(kenfar, Reddit, 2022-02-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/t3a56h/data_quality_management_tools/hytac7v/) (in reply to ID t3a56h):\nThere are multiple types of data quality tools, I'd recommend considering:\n\n   * Quality Control - Reconciliation: this is the single most valuable type of testing for a migration: basically it's a comparison of old data to new data.  This can be vastly more valuable than dbt or great expectations - since you can first confirm that both before & after versions of the data have the exact same number of rows, and then you can dive deeper and confirm that they have exactly the same values for each column.  For larger data volumes I'll sometimes just get samplings of rows to compare field values.\n   * Quality Assurance: unit-testing is insanely valuable, especially for field transformations.  Generally only easy to do if you're using something decomposable like python for the transforms.\n   * Quality Control - Constraint Checking: this is where dbt or great expectations can plug in.  They can validate that your data is \"in spec\": that uniqueness, foreign keys, nulls are valid, and that misc queries looking for invalid data don't find any.  However, for a migration you'd ideally run this on the before & after otherwise you don't know if these are new or old problems.\n\n## Comment ID hz2u3ge with +1 score by [(ivy_p, Reddit, 2022-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/t3a56h/data_quality_management_tools/hz2u3ge/) (in reply to ID t3a56h):\nAs mentioned in other comments, data observability is the new approach to managing data quality in the data stack.

Infact, Amundsen comes with backend service offerings with both Neo4j as well as Apache Atlas.\n\nThe design/arch for Amundsen is pretty simple and extensible. The number of connectors it supports is also a USP.\n\nYou may also look at Linkedin Datahub or Netflix Metcat. But for me, Amundsen is the hands down winner for its sheer simplicity and extensibility.\n\nhttps://github.com/amundsen-io/amundsen\n\nHowever, Data Governance is much more than just the Cataloging piece. If you are looking at ACL or Compliance, Amundsen will NOT be a complete solution in itself.\n\n### Comment ID gdfgsju with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-11-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/jzzkm0/what_do_you_use_for_data_governance/gdfgsju/) (in reply to ID gdfcpud):\nACL Is already handled externally (we use glue and IAM policies to determine who can access what data), what we are missing is something that performs data discovery/lineage and in the meantime is easy to use for people from the business\n\n#### Comment ID gdfjj5i with +3 score by [(set92, Reddit, 2020-11-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/jzzkm0/what_do_you_use_for_data_governance/gdfjj5i/) (in reply to ID gdfgsju):\nmetabase for the data discovery part?

You really need a tool that is directly tied to data modeling code to keep it up to date. So far it seems dbt is the leader in this area with its doc generation. It isn’t the prettiest but it does the job. Additionally, using dbt’s sources is a nice way to make raw data explicitly labeled and referenced in your models, and dbt's graph view documents data lineage for you with no additional work. Since dbt is usually developed in VCS this makes it easy to create a PR template in the dbt repo with a checkbox to add and update docs and enforce this during code review. Unfortunately dbt only works with DWHs so this isn’t a comprehensive approach.\n\nI tried getting my previous employer to adopt Google Cloud Data Catalog and it didn’t work. The idea was that we would try to add helpful descriptions on the dataset, table and column level with additional tags related to updated times and where the data’s source was. Most of these were applied by Airflow when data was updated. My coworkers were not willing to take the few additional minutes to document their datasets and this didn’t pan out but maybe it was just a culture problem.\n\n### Comment ID gdg5las with +2 score by [(ITLady, Reddit, 2020-11-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/jzzkm0/what_do_you_use_for_data_governance/gdg5las/) (in reply to ID gdfurg4):\nI'd flip that argument - it shouldnt be up to your engineers to catalog your data unless all you're caring about is improving your engineering practices and treating it only as technical documentation. \n\nAs for the getting buy in, that's definitely both a management and culture issue. One of our data architectural principals is that source systems are responsible for providing access to data via an API and that all data sources must be catalogued. It's a top down approach but it'll get used as we build out some of our other EA initiatives to drive it to actually happen.\n\n#### Comment ID gdg67v0 with +5 score by [(dream-fiesty, Reddit, 2020-11-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/jzzkm0/what_do_you_use_for_data_governance/gdg67v0/) (in reply to ID gdg5las):\nI'm not saying engineers should be the only ones to catalog your data. I'm saying the person that makes the dataset should be as they will understand where it comes from. Whether that's source data a data engineer is working on or a view an analyst builds for a report with dbt it doesn't matter. What matters is visibility, coupling to the data updating process, and version control. Adding a third party will just muddy waters and make things go out of date.\n\n### Comment ID gdh1qwd with +2 score by [(kenfar, Reddit, 2020-11-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/jzzkm0/what_do_you_use_for_data_governance/gdh1qwd/) (in reply to ID gdfurg4):\nI don't like the lack of extensibility with the dbt documentation, and the lineage is just at the table level and not where it really needs to be - at the column level.\n\nBut other than that it's pretty good.\n\n## Comment ID gdfx56d with +4 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-11-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/jzzkm0/what_do_you_use_for_data_governance/gdfx56d/) (in reply to ID jzzkm0):\nWe use Alation\n\n### Comment ID gdfyrrd with +2 score by [(GeneralDouglasMac, Reddit, 2020-11-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/jzzkm0/what_do_you_use_for_data_governance/gdfyrrd/) (in reply to ID gdfx56d):\nSame.

I haven't checked it in a while. Atlas is the only open source alternative I've heard of so looking forward to seeing what all gets thrown out here.\n\nThat said, we have informatica enterprise data catalog and Axon. We've been able to scan snowlake and ADLS gen 2 just fine but haven't built enough in airflow yet to test out the lineage aspects. We also have a fuck ton of old datastage ETL we need lineage from too. \n\nData governance is one of my big two initiatives I'm working on in my new architecture role this year into next. I'm planning to see how much were able to get automatically from it's intelligent scanning and then probably hook in atlas to feed EDC if I'm not getting what we need. Data governance to me is far, far more challenging than engineering as you're working across such different disciplines imo.\n\n### Comment ID gdjuld5 with +2 score by [(MrLewArcher, Reddit, 2020-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/jzzkm0/what_do_you_use_for_data_governance/gdjuld5/) (in reply to ID gdg67we):\nGet that Gartner magic quadrant shit out of here.

You have to tell stories about what happened because you had poor data quality (perhaps you missed 10,000 customers in an email blast because of missing attributes?) or things went slow because someone was having to try and track down the lineage of something for impact analysis.

We're different from some of the open source products in that we don't require you to send us your data, there is no heavy lift to get Tree Schema integrated into your data ecosystem.  With Tree Schema you can just connect your databases and we extract the metadata. No systems to keep running, no elastic search to setup, etc. and it's completely free for you to try without a credit card or hassle from a sales person. We also now support non-database metadata, specifically Tableau where we can not only capture the sheets and tables within Tableau but we automatically extract your data lineage. \n\nWe do, however, have a [data lineage API](https://treeschema.com/blog/data-lineage-api/) for some of the more technically inclined that allows you to manage your data lineage as code."

And not in the cliche business way either.\n\nSpeaking of family... lots of young families here at MC. So while it is a startup, there's a healthy balance if you have kids yourself (and they are so accommodating for those with kids!)\n\nOn the tech side, lots of up-to-date tooling working with modern stuff.

          "pros": "Monte Carlo brings everything that you love about early stage companies - humility, camaraderie, being obsessed with making customers successful, a lack of politics/egos, etc but with an executive team that is on its 2nd, 3rd, or 4th startup. \n\nThis is really important for a few reasons - \n1. Monte Carlo focuses on what matters rather than what they think should matter based on some YC blog they read.\n2. Monte Carlo actually has a natural work-life balance because 1) they can avoid burnout this way and 2) most folks have kids at home. This means no Sunday 11pm emails, no calls scheduled after 6pm, etc. \n3. Monte Carlo is obsessed with solving a HUGE problem with a monumental TAM (Snowflake-sized) because anyone that uses a cloud-based data warehouse has a problem trusting their data. \n\nAs a result, Monte Carlo can provide best-in-class benefits (because we've raised a lot of VC from best-in-class investors), hire the best people, and work with the most data-first companies in the ecosystem. Creating and owning a new category that other companies like Datadog (market cap of $35B) and Snowflake (market cap of $80B) will eventually step into is also very satisfying. \n\nFinally, having a woman as CEO that is not some 25 year old wunderkid out of Stanford/MIT/Harvard means diversity, equity, and inclusion starts at the top. We can recruit some of the best talent (1:1 female to male ratio currently) because our culture is actually inclusive and not full of 26 year old white guys from SoMa/The Marina.",

Monte Carlo focuses on what matters rather than what they think should matter based on some YC blog they read.\n2. Monte Carlo actually has a natural work-life balance because 1) they can avoid burnout this way and 2) most folks have kids at home. This means no Sunday 11pm emails, no calls scheduled after 6pm, etc. \n3. Monte Carlo is obsessed with solving a HUGE problem with a monumental TAM (Snowflake-sized) because anyone that uses a cloud-based data warehouse has a problem trusting their data. \n\nAs a result, Monte Carlo can provide best-in-class benefits (because we've raised a lot of VC from best-in-class investors), hire the best people, and work with the most data-first companies in the ecosystem. Creating and owning a new category that other companies like Datadog (market cap of $35B) and Snowflake (market cap of $80B) will eventually step into is also very satisfying. \n\nFinally, having a woman as CEO that is not some 25 year old wunderkid out of Stanford/MIT/Harvard means diversity, equity, and inclusion starts at the top. We can recruit some of the best talent (1:1 female to male ratio currently) because our culture is actually inclusive and not full of 26 year old white guys from SoMa/The Marina.",

      "# [What Is Data Observability? 5 Key Pillars To Know In 2025 by Barr Moses, Barr Moses CEO, Co-founder, action movies on 2024-03-01](https://www.montecarlodata.com/blog-what-is-data-observability/)\nEditor’s Note: So much has happened since we first published this post and created the data observability category and Monte Carlo in 2019. We have updated this post to reflect this rapidly maturing space. You can read the original article linked at the bottom of this page.\n\nWhat is Data Observability?\n\nI coined the term data observability in 2019. Here is how I define it today:\n\nData observability provides full visibility into the health of your data AND data systems so you are the first to know when the data is wrong, what broke, and how to fix it.\n\nThe solutions in this category feature machine learning anomaly detection, accelerated root cause analysis capabilities, and end-to-end data lineage. This approach results in healthier data pipelines, increased team productivity, enhanced data management practices, and ultimately, higher customer satisfaction.\n\nThe five pillars of data observability are:\n\nFreshness\n\nQuality\n\nVolume\n\nSchema\n\nLineage\n\nTogether, these components provide valuable insight into the quality and reliability of your data.\n\nIn this post, I’ll dive into these concepts in more detail, including what data observability is, what data observability isn’t, who it’s for, and how to choose the right data observability solution for your platform.\n\nLet’s jump in.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe origins of data observability\n\nI started thinking about the concept that I would later label “data observability” when I was serving as the former VP of Customer Success Operations at Gainsight.\n\nTime and again, we’d deliver a report, only to be notified minutes later about issues with our data. It didn’t matter how strong our ETL pipelines were or how many times we reviewed our SQL: our data just wasn’t reliable.\n\nUnfortunately, this problem wasn’t unique. After speaking with hundreds of data leaders about their biggest pain points, I learned that data downtime tops the list.\n\nData downtime — periods of time when data is partial, erroneous, missing, or otherwise inaccurate — only multiplies as data systems become increasingly complex, supporting an endless ecosystem of sources and consumers.\n\nMuch in the same way DevOps applies observability to software, I thought it was time data teams leveraged this same blanket of diligence and began creating the category of data observability as a more holistic way to approach data quality.\n\nAnd along with defining the category, I defined 5 key pillars that define data observability to this day.\n\nWhat are the five pillars of data observability?\n\n“Observability” is a concept many data leaders are probably familiar with from DevOps, but when it comes to data, what is it that we’re actually observing?\n\nNow, let’s take a look at each of these five pillars in a bit more detail.\n\nFreshness\n\nFreshness seeks to understand how up-to-date your data tables are, as well as the cadence at which your tables are updated. Freshness is particularly important when it comes to decision making; after all, stale data is basically synonymous with wasted time and money.\n\nQuality\n\nYour data pipelines might be in working order but the data flowing through them could be garbage. The quality pillar looks at the data itself and aspects such as percent NULLS, percent uniques and if your data is within an accepted range. Quality gives you insight into whether or not your tables can be trusted based on what can be expected from your data.\n\nVolume\n\nVolume refers to the completeness of your data tables and offers insights on the health of your data sources. If 200 million rows suddenly turns into 5 million, you should know.\n\nSchema\n\nChanges in the organization of your data, in other words, schema, often indicates broken data. Monitoring who makes changes to these tables and when is foundational to understanding the health of your data ecosystem.\n\nLineage\n\nWhen data breaks, the first question is always “where?” Data lineage provides the answer by telling you which upstream sources and downstream ingestors were impacted, as well as which teams are generating the data and who is accessing it. Good lineage also collects information about the data (also referred to as metadata) that speaks to governance, business, and technical guidelines associated with specific data tables, serving as a single source of truth for all consumers.\n\nWhy is data observability important?\n\nData observability is important for two reasons. For data engineers (and developers), data observability is important because data downtime means wasted time and resources; for data consumers, it’s equally as important because it erodes confidence in decision making.\n\nIn that sense, the value of data pipeline monitoring and data observability is near priceless. That being said, it’s unlikely the chief financial officer is going to accept “priceless” when you are building your business case. So let’s take a look at how data teams have measured data quality.\n\nA simple calculation for the estimated number of incidents you have each year (whether you are currently catching them or not) can be done by dividing the number of tables you have in your environment by 15.\n\nYou can then multiply this number by your average time-to-detection and average time-to-resolution. If you aren’t currently capturing these metrics, don’t worry, you are not alone.\n\nOur industry research revealed the industry average is about 4 hours and 9 hours respectively–feel free to use or adjust those estimates based on your organization’s data quality maturity.\n\nCongratulations, you have just calculated your data downtime! Now let’s calculate its cost, and thus the value of a data observability solution.\n\nThe first part of the calculation, labor cost, is relatively straightforward. Since we know data quality professionals spend around 40% of their time on inefficient data quality practices, we can use this formula:\n\nTotal data engineers x 1804 (average working hours in a year) x $62 (average salary) x .4\n\nThe operational cost of poor data quality is a bit harder to quantify. A data incident can be as harmless as a broken dashboard no one uses or as painful as reporting incorrect numbers to Wall Street.\n\nOne way to estimate this is to measure the overall risk. If an organization invests in its data team to increase overall efficiency 10% (or insert your own value here) then for each hour of data downtime we can assume the organization’s productivity has been reduced 10%. The formula is then:\n\nOverall data downtime x % reduction in hourly revenue generated.\n\nWe put together a data observability value calculator to help.\n\nData observability is as essential to DataOps as observability is to DevOps\n\nAs organizations grow and the underlying tech stacks powering them become more complicated (think: moving from a monolith to a microservices architecture), it became important for DevOps teams within the software engineering department to maintain a constant pulse on the health of their systems and deploy continuous integration and development (CI/CD) approaches.\n\nObservability, a more recent addition to the software engineering lexicon, speaks to this need, and refers to the monitoring, tracking, and triaging of incidents to prevent software application downtime.\n\nAt its core, there are three pillars of observability data :\n\nMetrics refer to a numeric representation of data measured over time.\n\nLogs, a record of an event that took place at a given timestamp, also provide valuable context regarding when a specific event occurred.\n\nTraces represent causally related events in a distributed environment.\n\n(For a more detailed description of these, I highly recommend reading Cindy Sridharan’s landmark post, Monitoring and Observability).\n\nTaken together, these three pillars and application management (APM) solutions like DataDog or Splunk, gave DevOps teams and software engineers valuable awareness and insights to predict future behavior, and in turn, trust their IT systems to meet SLAs.\n\nData engineering teams needed similar processes and tools to monitor their ETL (or ELT) pipelines and prevent data downtime across their data systems. Enter data observability.\n\nFor data engineers and developers, data observability is important because data downtime means wasted time and resources; for data consumers, it erodes confidence in your decision making.\n\nEvaluation criteria can be tricky when you may not even have a strong answer to the basic question, “what are data observability tools?” You can see what analysts have used as data observability criteria as well a a sample RFP, but in short a great data observability platform has the following features:\n\nIt connects to your existing stack quickly and seamlessly and does not require modifying your data pipelines, writing new code, or using a particular programming language. This allows quick time to value and maximum testing coverage without having to make substantial investments.\n\nIt monitors your data at-rest and does not require extracting the data from where it is currently stored. This allows the data observability solution to be performant, scalable and cost-efficient. It also ensures that you meet the highest levels of security and compliance requirements.\n\nIt requires minimal configuration and practically no threshold-setting. Data observability tools should use machine learning models to automatically learn your environment and your data. It uses anomaly detection techniques to let you know when things break. It minimizes false positives by taking into account not just individual metrics, but a holistic view of your data and the potential impact from any particular issue. You do not need to spend resources configuring and maintaining noisy rules within your data observability platform.\n\nIt requires no prior mapping of what needs to be monitored and in what way. It helps you identify key resources, key dependencies and key invariants so that you get broad data observability with little effort.\n\nIt provides rich context that enables rapid triage and troubleshooting, and effective communication with stakeholders impacted by data reliability issues. Data observability tools shouldn’t stop at “field X in table Y has values lower than Z today.”\n\nIt prevents issues from happening in the first place by exposing rich information about data assets so that changes and modifications can be made responsibly and proactively.\n\nData observability vs. data testing\n\nSimilar to how software engineers use unit tests to identify buggy code before it’s pushed to production, data engineers often leverage tests to detect and prevent potential data quality issues from moving further downstream.\n\nThis approach was (mostly) fine until companies began ingesting so much data that a single point of failure just wasn’t feasible.\n\nI’ve encountered countless data teams that suffer consistent data quality issues despite a rigorous testing regime. It’s deflating and a bad use of your engineers’ time.\n\nThe reason even the best testing processes are insufficient is because there are two types of data quality issues: those you can predict (known unknowns) and those you can’t (unknown unknowns).\n\nSome teams will have hundreds(!) of tests in place to cover most known unknowns but they don’t have an effective way to cover unknown unknowns.\n\nSome examples of unknown unknowns covered by data observability include:\n\nA Looker dashboard or report that is not updating, and the stale data goes unnoticed for several months—until a business executive goes to access it for the end of the quarter and notices the data is wrong.\n\nA small change to your organization’s codebase that causes an API to stop collecting data that powers a critical field in your Tableau dashboard.\n\nAn accidental change to your JSON schema that turns 50,000 rows into 500,000 overnight.\n\nAn unintended change happens to your ETL, ELT or reverse ETL that causes some tests not to run, leading to data quality issues that go unnoticed for a few days.\n\nA test that has been a part of your pipelines for years but has not been updated recently to reflect the current business logic.\n\nIn a Medium article, Vimeo Senior Data Engineer Gilboa Reif describes how using data observability and dimension monitors at scale help address the unknown unknowns gap that open source and transformation tools leave open.\n\nChoozle CTO Adam Woods says data observability gives his team a deeper insight than manual testing or monitoring could provide.\n\nTo summarize, data observability is different and more effective than testing because it provides end-to-end coverage, is scalable, and has lineage that helps with impact analysis.\n\nData observability vs. data monitoring\n\nData pipeline monitoring involves using machine learning to understand the way your data pipelines typically behave, and then send alerts when anomalies occur in that behavior (see the 5 pillars).\n\nSome tools within the modern data stack, like Airflow for instance, will have the ability to monitor their portion of the ETL pipeline. While helpful, data teams need to monitor their entire pipeline end-to-end from ingestion to landing and through transformation all the way to consumption in the BI layer.\n\nIt is also important that data pipeline monitoring is supplemented with a process for monitoring the data quality itself. This is because while the pipeline may be operating fine, the data flowing through it may be garbage.\n\nFor example, the data values may be outside the normal historical range or there could be anomalies present in the NULL rates or percent uniques. Monitoring the data itself can be done automatically with machine learning as well as by setting custom rules, for example if you know a monetary conversion rate can never be negative.\n\nWhen automated data monitoring is combined with features to accelerate incident resolution, understand the impact of those incidents, and illustrate data health over time, it then becomes data observability.\n\nData observability vs data quality\n\nData observability enables and improves data quality. Data quality is often expressed in the six dimensions of accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, validity, and uniqueness.\n\nI’ve found that among business stakeholders, the reality is data quality is considered a binary metric. Your CFO doesn’t come up to you and say, “the data was accurate but out of date so I’m considering it to be of average quality.”\n\nThose other data quality metrics are helpful for data professionals to understand what’s not working and where to focus their resources, but for your data consumers either the data quality is good or it’s bad. Just like a SaaS solution, either it’s working or it’s not. That’s why we created the metric of data downtime.\n\nWith a data observability solution in place, data teams can ensure they have high data quality.\n\nData quality vs data reliability\n\nThese terms are often used interchangeably, which is fine. However, another way to think about it is that solving for data quality requires you to think beyond a point in time, and consider how the quality changes over time in a variety of real-world conditions.\n\nThat is true data reliability.\n\nFor example, the quality of an airline might be measured based on its timeliness (percent of flights on-time), safety (major incidents) and food service approximating that of a diner.\n\nBut in order for the airline to be reliable, it’s expected to maintain those levels of quality consistently over time, across various routes, weather conditions and holiday weekends.\n\nSimilarly, a data product’s quality might be assessed by its availability at 9am, the completeness of records, and its consistency versus a source-of-record. For it to be reliable, you must assess whether it maintains these service levels over time, across holiday traffic spikes and product launches.\n\nIn solving for reliability you must not simply measure data quality (at a point in time and space), but also establish expected levels of quality and service (i.e. how quickly you’ll communicate and respond to incidents), and have the toolkit to rapidly diagnose and resolve data incidents.\n\nData observability vs data reliability engineering\n\nSome data observability companies have started to describe themselves or their tools in the framework of data reliability engineering.\n\nThis makes sense as data observability borrows heavily from observability and other concepts of site reliability engineering (SRE). While different solutions or tools may have significant differences in features offered, there is no real difference between data observability and data reliability engineering.\n\nBoth terms are focused on the practice of ensuring healthy, high quality data across an organization.\n\nSigns you need a data observability platform\n\nThis 2019 talk helped introduced data downtime and data observability. It is still relevant today.\n\nFrom speaking with hundreds of customers over the years, I have identified seven telltale signs that suggest your data team should prioritize data quality.\n\nThey are:\n\nYou’re data platform has recently migrated to cloud\n\nYour data stack is scaling with more data sources, more tables, and more complexity\n\nYour data team is growing\n\nYour team is spending at least 30% of their time firefighting data quality issues\n\nYour team has more data consumers than you did 1 year ago\n\nYour company is moving to a self-service analytics model\n\nData is a key part of the customer value proposition\n\nThe future of data observability\n\nData observability is a rapidly maturing but still evolving space. For example, G2 Crowd created a data observability category in late 2022, but as of this writing there is not a data observability Gartner Magic Quadrant. That being said, Gartner did place data observability on their 2022 Data Management Hype Cycle.\n\nHowever, multiple companies and technologies are identifying with the term data observability. There has been tremendous investor activity, and, most importantly, customer interest and values are at all-time highs.\n\nData observability is at the heart of the modern data stack, whether it’s enabling more self-service analytics and data team collaboration, adoption, or working alongside dbt unit tests and Airflow circuit breakers to prevent bad data from entering the data warehouse (or data lake) in the first place. It is also a core component of important and emerging data quality best practices such as data mesh, data SLAs, and data contracts.\n\nI see a bright future for data observability as data continues its march from dusty dashboards to the boardroom, machine learning models, operational systems, customer facing products, and more.\n\nWith data observability, data quality and data engineering are finally getting a seat at the table.\n\n[The original article that launched a category: What is data observability?

      "# [Snowflake Summit 2024 Keynote Recap: The Era of Enterprise AI by Michael Segner, data quality, data teams on 2024-06-04](https://www.montecarlodata.com/snowflake-summit-2024-keynote-recap-the-era-of-enterprise-ai/)\nWe’re covering the Snowflake Summit conference keynote for the third straight year (check out our 2022 and 2023 recaps). For Snowflake Summit 2024, festivities have moved from the Las Vegas desert to the San Francisco bay—and with its return to the tech capital came a whole list of buzzy new announcements.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSetting the Stage—Conference Pageantry and Neon Vibes\n\nCrossing the bigger-than-ever exhibitor “basecamp,” we shuffle to the keynote stage where we’re greeted by tasteful conference techno, lazer lights, and rollerbladers with ski poles.\n\nThe Moscone Center is one of the few locations that could hold this many people (rumors of a record 16,000 attendees this year add to the buzz), but still feel expansive. The keynote stage is the same.\n\nCapacity is massive and seats fill up gradually in the proceeding hour. One of my seatmates strikes up some small talk immediately disclaiming that he is on the business side and not very close to the tech, but excited to see what’s new.\n\nAs we wait, I Google to see if I can grab a sneak peek of any dropping news.\n\nIt’s hard to feel bad for a tech juggernaut, especially one that just announced record earnings, but I do feel a pang of empathy for the Snowflake press team as I’m hit with a wall of stories covering their denial of any culpability in the Ticketmaster breach. It looks like Snowflake is playing the cards close to the vest this year.\n\nThis year the stage will feature co-founder Benoît Dageville, EVP of product, Christian Kleinerman, and new CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy. Vegas is not laying odds on whether AI will feature prominently.\n\nThe opening video starts with big shots at big companies extolling the power of Snowflake. Fox, Paramount, and State Street rattle off one liners in quick succession.\n\nIt doesn’t really matter what they are saying–Snowflake is showing they have captured the hearts and minds of the C-suite in a way that we probably haven’t seen since Microsoft. Much of the keynote is directed to developers, but it would be a mistake to overlook what has made Snowflake a market juggernaut.\n\nGetting Geeky with Benoît\n\nAfter a short welcome and introduction from Sridhar Ramaswamy, Benoît takes the stage. There is an authenticity and energy to founder speakers that is hard to replicate, and Snowflake is wise to harness his swagger.\n\nHe gets a warm welcome from the crowd and immediately dives into the strategic vision of Snowflake which he outlines across 5 pillars. In a nutshell:\n\nData: The ability for Snowflake to handle all structured and unstructured data types.\n\nCompute: Elastic demand to run on any workloads. Not just separating compute from storage, but “compute from compute” with multiple workloads running on the same data.\n\nModels: Access to world class AI and LLM models including CortexAI and Arctic.\n\nGovernance: Snowpark Container Services and a unified platform for data and governance. “This is AI for enterprise, not AI for planning your next vacation.”\n\nCollaboration: Native apps and data sharing so you can share across regions and organizations.\n\nHis best line which drew some laughs was during the compute section when he reassured the audience that Snowflake was not a SQL engine contrary to what some might believe, “trust me I was there.” The long-term investment in the Dataflow engine, we are reminded, is the secret sauce that makes Snowflake the most efficient on the market.\n\nThroughout this overview of the big picture he hammered what is undoubtedly the central pillar of Snowflake’s strategic vision: simplicity.\n\nTaking A Journey With Christian Kleinerman\n\nThe rest of the keynote was MCed by Snowflake EVP of product Christian Kleinerman. He’s well suited to the role as a natural showman. You can feel the spontaneous energy coming from him, which is a welcome change from tightly scripted remarks, teleprompter reading, and stage blocking.\n\nThis year each product announcement is followed by a thumping sound effect letting the audience know it’s time to clap and creating a sense of building momentum. And on their own merits, the parade of announcements is genuinely exciting.\n\nIn this parade it’s easy to lose sight of what is perhaps the most ambitious move Snowflake is making. It’s not new and it’s not something they are trying to hide, but this year it became clear that they may be able to execute on the vision of being the “iPhone of data apps.”\n\nFor a company that owns the C-Suite like Microsoft, this Apple platform and tax vision is potentially game changing. In years past, it looked like the Snowflake Marketplace might sell you a ML app or a LLM model. As buzzy as those things are, they are pocket change and rapidly becoming commoditized. What Snowflake actually wants to sell you is each part of the modern data stack.\n\nThe exhibitor “basecamp” that is 8x the size of their competitors? All future apps to be purchased on your iPhone AI data cloud.\n\nBut let’s not digress too much. Let’s hop into each section of Christian’s talk: data, apps, AI.\n\nStrengthening the Data Foundation\n\nDocumentAI, Dynamic Tables, Iceberg, and Polaris\n\nChristian starts with reminding the crowd of the power of one of last year’s big announcements (and perhaps most unfortunately named feature): DocumentAI. This bland sounding feature actually describes the incredible capability to use natural language to ask questions about documents.\n\nWith flashing strobes and a big thump Christian announces DocumentAI will move to general availability. The well prompted crowd shows a fair amount of enthusiasm which is soon dwarfed by their reaction to Christian’s next announcement on the general availability of Dynamic Tables.\n\nDynamic Tables (which Monte Carlo supports) helps to transform data on load without the need for an additional target table. This feature simplifying the movement of data is exciting for all the data and analytical engineers in attendance.\n\nServerless Tasks, the open sourcing of the Polaris catalog, and the general availability of Iceberg across all crowds also get mentions and strong responses from the crowd. You have to wonder if Iceberg was set to get a greater share of the spotlight prior to the Databricks announcement earlier this morning regarding their acquisition of Tabular, the company founded by the original creators of Apache Iceberg.\n\nInterlude with Microsoft CVP Arun Ulagaratchagan\n\nArun took the stage next in a section that was a bit shoe-horned to demonstrate their partnership with Microsoft. Broad remarks on the importance of partnership, open source data formats, interoperability and Microsoft Fabric were made.\n\nWhile a bit tangential, it is nice to see the direction these platforms are taking toward interoperability and having Fabric OneLake queryable by Snowflake (even if it may be built on the back of Delta tables).\n\nGovernance, Compliance, Lineage\n\nChristian strode back on stage for the next set of data foundation announcements. Some of the bigger features highlighted included:\n\nUniversal Search: The one search bar that will help you find everything. Now generally available.\n\nInternal Marketplace: An extension of the Snowflake Marketplace but curated for your organization. Now in private preview\n\nAI Object Description: Leveraging CortexAI to automatically generate object descriptions. This is a feature included in many data catalogs that can sometimes seem superficial and counterintuitive. What you really want to understand from documentation is not usually what AI can intuit.\n\nData classification and custom classification: The ability to specify properties at the schema level or using specific rules to better identify, tag, and govern your data.\n\nObject Insights Interface: Horizon now contains upstream and downstream data lineage for a table within the Snowflake ecosystem. This includes ML lineage to models which is exciting. Snowflake has also introduced some basic data quality rule functionality.\n\nBuild and distribute apps\n\nContainer Services and Native Apps\n\nThis was the heart of the keynote and got the most energy from the crowd. It’s also the heart of their ambitious “iPhone” of the modern data stack strategy I detailed above.\n\nChristian relays the positive feedback Snowflake has received on both services before revealing that Snowflake Native Apps and Container Services will be fully integrated. So in other words, the native app framework that allows apps to be built, deployed, and monetized through the marketplace (and skip the procurement and security reviews) is now connected with the ability for developers to containerize their workloads in an accelerated dev cycle.\n\nI ran into a former colleague launching a financial application startup that is planning to aggressively take advantage of Snowpark Container Services and Native Apps. For them, these aren’t features, it’s going to be a big component of their competitive advantage.\n\nDemo Series with Jeff Hollan\n\nBecause “we’re integrating Container Services and Native Apps” undersells the vision, Snowflake Director of Product Management Jeff Hollan comes out to demonstrate. His energy is infectious and he’s clearly having fun, bad puns and all (I’m so excited I can barely contain myself).\n\nWe get three quick and compelling demos showing:\n\nAn app that uses hybrid tables to monitor telecom infrastructure uptime,\n\nA graph analytics native app that analyzes cell phone tower location and network resiliency, and\n\nA GenAI model running in Snowpark containers that is classifying the sentiment of customer support tickets and helping to generate responses.\n\nAll of the demos are impressive, but the crowd is especially responsive to the graphs analytics app as it dawns on them that a whole host of solutions that may have required quarter or year long procurement cycles could now be at their fingertips in minutes (if they have some spare Snowflake credits rattling around).\n\nThis is when it also dawns on me that Snowflake’s unique position of owning the data storage layer gives them an incredible opportunity not just to market a few shallow ML marketing spend optimization ML apps but to be the distribution channel for the modern data stack.\n\n“If you can dream it, you can build it in Snowflake.”\n\nDevOps, Snowflake Trail, and Notebooks\n\nChristian strides back on stage and takes a moment to feed off of Jeff’s energy and demo enthusiasm. He then quickly covers some features that I personally found to be among the most exciting.\n\nData reliability engineering has been rapidly maturing and trying to reach the auspicious milestones of site reliability engineering. Only recently have data teams started to treat their query code like their application code with processes like version control and pull requests.\n\nMonte Carlo, for example, will automatically correlate a code change to any data anomalies that may result from it.\n\nChristian’s announcements are in this vein of making query code a first class citizen including Git integration, database change management, Snowflake Notebooks and Snowflake CLI. He then also announced Snowflake Trail–a new observability (think application performance management not data observability) service that will help monitor code telemetry (metrics, traces, logs) across Snowflake.\n\nAccelerate AI\n\nWe have now made it to the third and final section of the three hour keynote and while the announcements are still exciting, energy levels are definitely starting to wane.\n\nChristian starts with asking the crowd who uses Pandas to do machine learning? And plays off the lack of raised hands joking, “looks like only Benoit.” Still, the Snowpark Pandas API entering public preview is a welcome addition. We then get a review of Snowflake end-to-end machine learning capabilities including the feature store and model registry (which Monte Carlo takes advantage of).\n\nWe’re now at the big AI announcements: Arctic, Snowflake Copilot, Cortex AI and Cortex Search.\n\nChristian puts Arctic, the LLMs built and released by Snowflake in the proper context. He didn’t overhype it as the next ChatGPT. He also struck the right balance between plugging its benefits in specific functions like generating SQL while pointing out there are a lot of models in the market with barely distinguishable performance metrics.\n\nChristian then plugged the more than 20,000 people using Snowflake Copilot as part of generating or fixing code in Snowflake before announcing that it is now generally available.\n\nCortexAI, which allows any user to query the data using natural language, seemed to be positioned a bit oddly as a replacement for data analysts and as a result got a more muted response from the very human crowd.\n\nInterlude with Snowflake Cortex with Amanda Kelly\n\nAmanda Kelly, Director of Product Management at Snowflake entered the stage for a clearly very well-rehearsed demo on Snowflake’s CortexAI, Snowflake’s fully managed service for hosting LLMs to –you guessed it – simplify the process for enterprise businesses to build GenAI apps.\n\nIt was pretty impressive to see her get a proof of concept for an app up and running within Snowflake in just minutes, and on the fly she prompted the LLM (in this case Mistral) to write an email “using a lot of happy emojis” – to which it happily and automatically obliged.\n\nThe Big Finale\n\nAnd then finally, for the penultimate announcement, Christian the Showman, took the biggest risk I’ve ever seen at a major tech keynote. It was fun, filled with promise, and a flop.\n\nI love that he and Snowflake went for it, and I hope the result doesn’t create future overly scripted keynotes. After repeating, “Cortex Search is so easy anyone can create a chatbot.” He proceeds to endeavor to prove his point by inviting a random member of the audience to conduct the next demo.\n\nWhat followed was a keynote demonstration for the ages.\n\nOur demo-er, Alicia, was truly a random member of the audience. Admitting that she’d only logged into Snowflake “a few times,” Alicia was excited to jump in head first. Unfortunately this ambitious, spontaneous demo ground to a halt as we learned that anyone can create a chatbot after a few attempts with Christian Kleinerman over your shoulder directing you where to click.\n\nUltimately, it’s a powerful message.

      "# [Monte Carlo aids data observability with root cause analysis by Eric Avidon on 2024-10-07](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/news/366612784/Monte-Carlo-aids-data-observability-with-root-cause-analysis)\nNew capabilities\n\nData quality is imperative, perhaps more so now than ever as enterprise interest in AI increases and more processes get automated.\n\nWith data being the foundation for analytics and AI, data needs to be accurate for the decisions based on analytics and AI to likewise be accurate. Meanwhile, with data volume increasing exponentially and the complexity of data also rising, it's impossible for even teams of humans to monitor every data point and data set for quality.\n\nIn response, vendors such as Monte Carlo and other data observability specialists including Acceldata, Metaplane and Soda have developed platforms that automatically monitor data for quality and alert users when incidents occur.\n\nThose alerts, however, have to do with the data points and data sets rather than the underlying code. Therefore, to remedy an incident, data engineers and other experts still have to trace the incident back to its source -- its root cause -- before it can be fixed. That process can take on average 15 hours, according to a survey of more than 200 data professionals by Monte Carlo and Wakefield Research.\n\nThat's nearly two full workdays just to find the source of a single incident and get it remedied. Root cause analysis aims to eliminate much of the time and expense related to discovering and resolving the changes that cause data quality problems.\n\nData quality issues can often be traced to one of three causes, according to Gavish: problems with the data itself, something amiss in a system or trouble with code.\n\nMonte Carlo's new root cause analysis capabilities specifically target issues with Databricks and GitLab code, whether they are simple coding mistakes by developers and engineers or unforeseen consequences of intentional updates.\n\nDevelopers and engineers get alerts when incidents are detected, including information that correlates the incident with the specific change that caused it. As a result, downtime -- the time it takes to resolve data quality problems -- is reduced by about 80%, according to Monte Carlo.\n\n\"When it comes to resolving data issues, speed is everything,\" Gavish said. \"Being able to quickly root cause code-related issues leads to faster resolution. When you have visibility into data, systems and code issues all in one platform, it's much easier to understand the root cause.\"\n\nSpecifically, using Monte Carlo's new root cause analysis capabilities, the data observability vendor's customers can easily view Databricks query logs and query changes for each table. By doing so, they can see whether there was a query change to that particular table or a table in another part of the data pipeline, and if that change is the cause of the problem.\n\nSimilarly, Monte Carlo's new capabilities enable GitLab users to see which pull requests are linked to which tables. This can help users understand when those requests occurred and new code was merged, and if that new code is causing a data quality issue.\n\nGiven the visibility they enable, Monte Carlo's new root cause analysis capabilities for Databricks query code and GitLab pull requests are significant for the data observability vendor's customers, according to Petrie.\n\n\"Data teams frequently revise transformation code to meet changing business requirements, adjust formats, filter columns and so on,\" he said. \"While they try to minimize errors by branching and testing pipeline code, some problems inevitably get into production and break data quality. Monte Carlo helps data engineers spot those errors faster by autodetecting anomalous logs.\"\n\nGiven its potential impact for developers and engineers, Monte Carlo has plans to expand its data observability platform to include root cause analysis capabilities beyond Databricks and GitLab.\n\nDatabricks and GitLab are each popular environments for developers, with Databricks aggressively building an environment for developing generative AI, traditional AI and machine learning models during the past couple of years. However, many developers and engineers prefer other platforms for building data and AI models and applications.\n\nTo meet their needs, Monte Carlo plans to expand its root cause analysis capabilities beyond Databricks and GitLab, according to Gavish, though he did not specify which platforms the company plans to target next.\n\n\"We are constantly exploring and building new and stronger ways to enhance Monte Carlo's resolution capabilities,\" he said. \"We believe strongly in empowering our customers to resolve data issues right where they start.\"",
      "# [Finding Happiness in Major Career Moves at Monte Carlo Data by Conlan Carter on 2024-03-29](https://builtin.com/articles/finding-happiness-major-career-moves-monte-carlo-data)\nMuch like Monte Carlo’s data observability platform finds better ways for data to be useful for its customers, it has found its employees from unique and unconventional places and backgrounds.\n\nDevon McMahon, an outbound sales development representative, earned a wealth of experience working in local municipalities as a 9-1-1 dispatcher and police officer before ultimately ending up in sales. Working in law enforcement meant many long hours away from home — pushing McMahon to consider a career with healthier work-life boundaries.\n\n“I found myself unbalanced with the amount of time I was away from family and how much of myself I was leaving behind at work every day,” McMahon said.\n\nWhen McMahon’s friends suggested he’d do well in sales, he was thrilled to explore the parallels between tech sales and police work.\n\n“I was an expert in California criminal law and process similar to how a salesperson is an expert in the product and problem it can solve,” McMahon explained. “The role is to be a guide and identify positive outcomes.”\n\nAfter over a decade of working outside of the tech industry, McMahon found his way to Monte Carlo, a startup environment where growth opportunities were made easier to find by a talented team of leaders and mentors, all of whom encourage new employees to take ownership of their own career paths — whatever they may look like. While a career shift can feel to many like a setback, finding a role at Monte Carlo meant also finding a good, balanced place to thrive for McMahon.\n\n“The environment nurtures my professional and personal growth,” he said. “Sales is hard in a different way than being a police officer,” he said.\n\nOn the sales team, the support from experienced account executives and management allowed McMahon to ask questions, bounce ideas off others and envision his future in tech sales. A top-performing SDR, McMahon is now a team lead, sharing the lessons he’s learning with junior sales colleagues — many of those lessons emerged from years in public service. Now, as an SDR leader, McMahon sees his former career as unparalleled experience in customer service.\n\n“I knew the folks in the community I served didn’t get to choose who showed up to their call, and it was my responsibility to provide the best service possible. Often I would be talking to people on the worst day of their lives, and I might have been the first police officer they’d ever met. I wanted each person to understand why I was doing what I was doing and what to expect next.”\n\n“The role is to be a guide and identify positive outcomes.”\n\nNow, McMahon’s professional first impressions with the general public have an entirely different context, but thanks to the culture at Monte Carlo, he’s well-equipped with a unique background that sets him apart as a tech salesperson.\n\nWhile tech sales may have been the endpoint for McMahon as he transitioned from policework, for Backend Engineer Sam Smith, tech sales was the starting point. While it only took a year for Smith to realize tech sales was not the right fit, the exposure led him to a new goal: a role in software engineering.\n\nSmith quit his sales role to drive for Lyft full-time while attending a coding boot camp, which landed him his first role in support engineering. Eventually, this led him to a support engineer position at Monte Carlo.\n\n“It has been a windy road to get to this point,” Smith said.\n\nWhen approached about a position at Monte Carlo, Smith clarified that, while he was excited about a support engineer position, his ultimate goal was engineering itself. Leveraging his experience in support engineering for his first year at the startup, Smith helped build the early support team, ultimately leading him to his first proper software engineer title — a lateral, internal move at Monte Carlo.\n\n“When I became a software engineer, I fulfilled a goal that I had set out on almost eight years prior,” Smith said. “It was by far the biggest career success of my life and something that still gives me a lot of personal satisfaction to think about.”\n\n“Becoming a software engineer was by far the biggest career success of my life and something that still gives me a lot of personal satisfaction to think about.”\n\nThis career pivot started with Smith’s years of experience as a support engineer, which prepared him well for a fast-paced tech startup environment. As a support engineer, Smith’s skillset for “survivability” in navigating unfamiliar technology allowed him to confidently tackle new challenges, utilizing the same skills to grow as a software engineer working on new projects.\n\n“As a support engineer, you have to be able to move fast and be ok with getting thrown into new technologies and documentation and quickly pull out useful information,” Smith said. “In a lot of ways, it feels like every project I worked on in the first few months as a software engineer were stretch projects.”\n\nJoining a robust team of software engineers with decades of experience, Smith has found joy in code reviews and regular conversations about tech-related topics as continuous opportunities to become a better engineer. While his team moves quickly, Smith has embraced the speed as an “absolute blessing” as he gets a variety of engineering experience. Now, finally, on his preferred career path, Smith feels all the more excited about where this journey will take him.\n\n“I have had jobs before where the thought of being in the same role five years down the road would fill me with dread,” Smith said. “Now I think about being a software engineer at Monte Carlo five, ten years down the road, and it makes me really excited.”\n\n“I think about being a software engineer at Monte Carlo five, ten years down the road, and it makes me really excited.”\n\nStories like Smith’s and McMahon’s are not atypical on the Monte Carlo team. As Head of Recruiting, Brenda Tern has seen many similar stories of exciting career growth at Monte Carlo, including her own.\n\nWith years of experience in recruiting leadership, Tern joined Monte Carlo to help find the right talent for the growing organization, and over a year and a half, her role expanded to cover human resources. As budding companies, startups typically have a significant gap in HR resources, and as Tern became responsible for more HR-related areas of the company, she discovered a “true calling and passion for the entire people function” beyond recruiting.\n\n“I've gained more experience during my time at Monte Carlo than I ever had in any other role due to the unstructured environment that makes our culture so unique,” said Tern.\n\n“I've gained more experience during my time at Monte Carlo than I ever had in any other role due to the unstructured environment that makes our culture so unique.”\n\nAs someone uniquely positioned to speak on Monte Carlo’s career growth opportunities, Tern explained that employees are given autonomy in their career path. While not everyone holds an end goal in mind, leadership at Monte Carlo encourages their direct reports to ask questions and take on stretch projects while they can.\n\n“We want everyone to advocate for how they see their careers evolve — and leaders are there to help provide guidance and feedback, but ultimately it's up to the individual,” said Tern.\n\nAdditionally, Tern cited the success of a recently established mentorship program, where members of the women's ERG are paired with employees looking for career guidance, and executive coaching is available to employees who request it.\n\nHelping to provide many of these newer career opportunities is Tern, who has an exciting Monte Carlo career journey all her own. From recruiting to the complex world of benefits, compensation, leadership coaching and more, Tern is helping shape the careers of present and future employees at Monte Carlo Data.",

      "# [Monte Carlo adds more GenAI to data observability platform by Eric Avidon, Sean Kerner on 2024-11-14](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/news/366615641/Monte-Carlo-adds-more-GenAI-to-data-observability-platform)\nNew capabilities\n\nAnalytics and AI tools demand high-quality data. Reports, dashboards, models and applications are only as good as the data that informs them. Without accurate data that can be trusted, analytics and AI tools will be inaccurate and untrustworthy.\n\nEnsuring data quality, however, is impossible even for teams of data experts.\n\nBefore the advent of cloud-based data warehouses and lakes that can store massive amounts of data, organizations kept their data in on-premises databases overseen by IT teams. Decision-makers had to submit tickets to IT departments requesting them to develop reports and dashboards, and IT teams could carefully check data for its quality before including it in an analytics product.\n\nNow, however, decisions need to be made in real time. Due to the cloud, organizations can collect and store exponentially more data than they could when data was exclusively kept on premises.\n\nAs a result, the sheer volume of data -- nearly half of all organizations now manage at least 500 petabytes of data -- makes it futile for data teams to even attempt to observe data for quality manually.\n\nEnter data observability vendors such as Monte Carlo, Acceldata, Metaplane and Soda Data -- among others -- that provide platforms that automate monitoring data.\n\nLike many of its peers, Monte Carlo was founded late last decade. Since its start in 2019, the vendor has added to and improved its capabilities to better enable customers to track data as it moves through pipelines and informs analytics and AI tools. Over the past two years, that has included developing generative AI-powered features to simplify data observability, including a tool that enables users to generate code using natural language and another that uses generative AI to suggest fixes in code.\n\nNow the vendor is adding a new generative AI feature.\n\nGenAI Monitor Recommendations uses a large language model (LLM) to examine an organization's data and deliver recommendations for developing and deploying data quality monitors. Development and deployment can then be executed by technical and non-technical users alike with previously existing generative AI tools such as Generate with AI.\n\nGenAI Monitor Recommendations is powered by Data Explorer, Monte Carlo's data profiling engine. Integrated with an LLM, Data Explorer uses generative AI to discover relationships between columns and patterns in data that would be nearly impossible for humans to find.\n\nSubsequently, GenAI Monitor Recommendations suggests data quality rules and monitors to build and deploy that help users engender trust in the data they use to train analytics and AI tools.\n\nTrust, meanwhile, is a critical focus for all data management and analytics vendors as they seek to help customers develop analytics and AI tools, according to Aslett. If users don't trust the data underlying reports, dashboards, models and applications, they won't use the analytics and AI tools to inform decisions.\n\n\"As enterprises seek to automate aspects of their decision-making processes using AI, it is essential that they have confidence in the data upon which AI depends,\" Aslett said. \"This has increased the focus on data observability software providers and the role they play in ensuring data meets quality and reliability requirements.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the use of generative AI tools to automate and improve data observability is somewhat nascent, he continued. As a result, Monte Carlo's addition of GenAI Monitor Recommendations is not only significant for users, but it could also help the vendor differentiate itself from its peers.\n\n\"The use of GenAI in data observability is still emerging and has not yet been widely adopted by data observability software providers, so the launch of GenAI Monitor Recommendations gives Monte Carlo a potential competitive advantage over some of its rivals in lowering the barriers to widespread adoption,\" Aslett said.\n\nStewart Bond, an analyst at IDC, noted that GenAI Monitor Recommendations fits into the concept of AI for data, which is one of the main areas in which data-driven organizations are investing. AI for data simply means using technologies such as data observability that are embedded with AI to make them more accurate and efficient.\n\nIn addition, GenAI Monitor Recommendations aligns with the increasing emphasis on data quality demanded by surging enterprise interest in developing AI tools, Bond continued.\n\n\"Data quality has to be addressed to improve the accuracy and relevancy of AI outcomes,\" he said.\n\nAs a result, GenAI Monitor Recommendations is a timely addition for Monte Carlo that addresses user needs, according to Bond.\n\n\"Adding GenAI capabilities to Monte Carlo is an important feature for users,\" he said. \"Manual processes are no longer reasonable, and relationships within data not recognizable without using technology to uncover them.\"\n\nRegarding the impetus for developing GenAI Monitor Recommendations, Lior Gavish, co-founder and chief technology officer of Monte Carlo, noted that much of the vendor's product development aims to help users be more productive and extract more value from their data.\n\nGenAI Monitor Recommendations aims to address both.\n\n\"Writing data quality rules takes time, and the larger or more complex the data or the environment becomes, that time really adds up,\" Gavish said. \"With GenAI Monitor Recommendations, our customers receive actionable recommendations for new monitors based on relational patterns in their data, saving them time from having to write dozens if not hundreds of rules manually.\"\n\nIn addition, because generative AI is able to monitor data for semantic meaning, it enables the discovery of relationships between data points and datasets that might not otherwise be discovered, Gavish continued.\n\n\"That can catch issues that may have otherwise gone undetected [and do so] before they wreak havoc on the business,\" he said.\n\nWhile GenAI Monitor Recommendations provides new generative AI-fueled data observability capabilities, Monte Carlo's DataOps Dashboard is designed to equip organizations with a means of easily viewing operational metrics and tracking the progress of data quality initiatives.\n\nBy providing users with a clear view of metrics that show data quality, users will better understand whether data can be trusted and used to inform analytics and AI projects to make decisions or if it needs to be improved before it can be operationalized.\n\nData observability metrics populating the DataOps Dashboard include response times for monitor alerts, incident resolution times, total number of incidents, severity of incidents and responsible parties for rectifying incidents.\n\nJust as the motivation for developing GenAI Monitor Recommendations is to save users time and derive more value from their data, efficiency and value provided the impetus for creating the DataOps Dashboard, according to Gavish.\n\n\"In the same way that [application performance monitoring] solutions help teams not just detect issues but also root cause and resolve them, Monte Carlo is dedicated to helping teams reduce the amount of time and resources spent on data quality,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, given the added insight into data observability provided by the DataOps Dashboard, it is a beneficial new tool for Monte Carlo customers, according to Aslett.\n\n\"DataOps can enable data professionals to measure improvements related to the use of data and demonstrate the value of their role to the wider organization,\" he said. \"Monte Carlo already provides users with key metrics related to the health of specific datasets. The DataOps Dashboard provides additional operational context to provide a more holistic view of data reliability.\"",

      "# [Monte Carlo Announces Support for Apache Kafka and Vector Databases to Enable More Reliable Data and AI Products on 2023-11-08](https://www.bigdatawire.com/this-just-in/monte-carlo-announces-support-for-apache-kafka-and-vector-databases-to-enable-more-reliable-data-and-ai-products/)\nSAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 8, 2023 — Monte Carlo, a data observability leader, today announced a series of new product advancements to help companies tackle the challenge of ensuring reliable data for their data and AI products.\n\nAmong the enhancements to its data observability platform are integrations with Kafka and vector databases, starting with Pinecone. These forthcoming capabilities will help teams tasked with deploying and scaling generative AI use cases to ensure that the data powering large-language models (LLMs) is reliable and trustworthy at each stage of the pipeline. With this news, Monte Carlo becomes the first-ever data observability platform to announce data observability for vector databases, a type of database designed to store and query high-dimensional vector data, typically used in RAG architectures.\n\nTo help these initiatives scale cost-effectively, Monte Carlo has released two first-of-its-kind data observability products, Performance Monitoring and Data Product Dashboard. While Performance Monitoring makes it easy for teams to monitor and optimize inefficiencies in cost-intensive data pipelines, Data Product Dashboard allows data and AI teams to seamlessly track the reliability of multi-source data and AI products, from business critical dashboards to assets used by AI.\n\nThe Future of Enterprise AI Hinges on Data Reliability\n\nToday’s announcements come amid the rapid growth of generative AI initiatives and subsequent focus on democratizing access to data. According to Databricks’ State of Data and AI report, the number of companies using SaaS LLM APIs (used to access services like ChatGPT) has grown 1310% between the end of November 2022 and the beginning of May 2023. Additionally, the report cited a 411% increase in the number of AI models put into production during the same period.\n\nAccording to a 2023 Wakefield Research survey, data and AI teams spent double the amount of time and resources on data downtime year-over-year, owing to an increase in data volume, pipeline complexity, and organization-wide data use cases. The same survey found that time-to-resolution was a major culprit of the rise of data downtime, a 166% increase on average from last year.\n\nTo combat the trend of data downtime and help teams resolve data quality issues quickly and collaboratively, Monte Carlo’s newest product enhancements unlock operational processes and key business SLAs that drive data trust, including cloud warehouse performance and cost optimization and maximizing the reliability of revenue-driving data products.\n\nPowering the Future of Trusted AI with Kafka and Vector Database Support\n\nApache Kafka, an open-source data streaming technology that enables high-throughput, low-latency data movement is an increasingly popular architecture with which companies are building cloud-based data and AI products. With Monte Carlo’s Kafka integration, customers can ensure the data that must be fed to AI and ML models in real-time for specific use cases is reliable and trustworthy.\n\nAnother critical component of building and scaling enterprise-ready AI products is the ability to store and query vectors, or mathematical representations of text and other unstructured data used in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or fine-tuning pipelines. Available in early 2024, Monte Carlo is the first data observability platform to support trust and reliability for vector databases, such as Pinecone.\n\n“To unlock the potential of data and AI, especially large language models (LLMs), teams need a way to monitor, alert to, and resolve data quality issues in both real-time streaming pipelines powered by Apache Kafka and vector databases powered by tools like Pinecone and Weaviate,” said Lior Gavish, co-founder and CTO of Monte Carlo. “Our new Kafka integration gives data teams confidence in the reliability of the real-time data streams powering these critical services and applications, from event processing to messaging. Simultaneously, our forthcoming integrations with major vector database providers will help teams proactively monitor and alert to issues in their LLM applications.”\n\nExpanding end-to-end coverage across both batch, streaming, and RAG pipelines enables organizations to realize the full potential of their AI initiatives with trusted, high-quality data.\n\nBoth integrations will be available in early 2024. Visit the Monte Carlo blog for frequent updates.\n\nAlongside these updates, we’re partnering with Confluent to develop an enterprise-grade data streaming integration for Monte Carlo customers. Built by the original creators of Kafka, Confluent Cloud provides businesses with a fully managed, cloud-native data streaming platform to eliminate the burdens of open source infrastructure management and accelerate innovation with real-time data.\n\nOperationalizing Data Observability for Data and AI Products at Scale\n\nAs enterprises look to incorporate generative AI capabilities both for internal and external use cases, the need to build, refine, and fine-tune the underlying data pipelines only grows. To help companies achieve reliable, enterprise-ready AI and trustworthy data products, Monte Carlo is excited to announce new performance monitoring and data product dashboards to easily track the health of its most critical assets.\n\nPerformance Monitoring: When adopting data AI products, efficiency and cost monitoring are critical considerations that impact product design, development, and adoption. Our new Performance dashboard allows customers to avoid unnecessary cost and runtime inefficiencies by allowing them to easily detect and resolve slow-running data and AI pipelines. Performance allows users to easily filter queries related to specific DAGs, users, dbt models, warehouses, or datasets. Users can then drill down to spot issues and trends and determine how performance was impacted by changes in code, data, and warehouse configuration.\n\nData Product Dashboard: Data Product Dashboard allows customers to easily define a data product, track its health, and report on its reliability to business stakeholders via direct integrations with Slack, Teams, and other collaboration channels. Customers can now easily identify which data assets feed a particular dashboard, ML application or AI model, and unify detection and resolution for relevant data incidents in a single view.\n\nWith this added ability to track key reliability SLAs at the individual data product level, Monte Carlo becomes the first data observability platform to enable observability at the organizational, domain, and data/AI product levels.\n\nLearn more about Performance Monitoring and Data Product Dashboard via docs.\n\nAll Eyes on AI at IMPACT 2023\n\nToday’s announcements were made at Monte Carlo’s third-annual IMPACT Data Observability Summit. In addition to being the world’s only data observability conference, this year’s IMPACT Summit brought together some of the foremost experts on the topic of reliable data and AI, including:\n\nEli Collins, VP of Product, Google DeepMind\n\nNga Phan, SVP of Product Management, Salesforce AI\n\nNeta Iser, VP of Data and Integration, Navan (formerly TripActions)\n\nOliver Gomes, VP of Analytics and Strategy, Fox\n\nKrishnan Parasuraman, VP, Head of the Office of the Field CTO, Snowflake\n\nCraig Wiley, Sr. Director of Product for AI/ML, Databricks\n\nTristan Handy, Co-Founder and CEO, dbt Labs\n\nGeorge Fraser, CEO and co-founder, Fivetran\n\nPrukalpa Sankar, Co-Founder, Atlan\n\nAnd more\n\nTo learn more about Monte Carlo’s vision for enterprise-ready AI and data observability, visit montecarlodata.com or request a demo.\n\nAbout Monte Carlo\n\nAs businesses increasingly rely on data to power digital products and drive better decision-making, it’s mission-critical that data and AI are accurate and reliable.

      "# [The Coolest Data Observability And DataOps Companies Of The 2024 Big Data 100 by Rick Whiting](https://www.crn.com/news/software/2024/the-coolest-data-observability-and-dataops-companies-of-the-2024-big-data-100)\nPart 6 of CRN’s Big Data 100 takes a look at the vendors solution providers should know in the data operations and data observability space.\n\nUpon Closer Observation\n\nData teams within businesses and organizations strive to provide internal business users and external customers with analytical insights. But those efforts often fall short because the data and analytic systems and processes that support those initiatives produce low-quality results.\n\nWith so much riding on big data today, problems with data quality and reliability can be as disruptive to business operations as an IT system outage—or worse because the damage may not be discovered until after the fact, such as with a marketing campaign that failed due to faulty data.\n\nData observability tools are focused on the data itself and an organization’s data operations (DataOps) – the flow of data from its source to the end-consumer of analytical results. They monitor and manage the quality and reliability of data, data pipelines and data infrastructure, and are used to investigate and remediate data-related problems.

In this study, we conducted a cumulative risk assessment based on hazard-driven criteria to evaluate the co-exposure to elemental contaminants in the diet of the population in Chongqing Municipality. The cumulative risk was calculated and evaluated using Monte Carlo modeling and the modified Reference Point Index (mRPI) method. Neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity were identified as the main toxic endpoints, and the final evaluation elements included were Pb, Cd, As, and Hg. The results showed that the combined mRPI values for neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, resulting from exposure to the four heavy metals, ranged from 0.922 to 4.835 and 1.306 to 7.031, respectively. Cd and Pb were the primary contributors to nephrotoxicity, while Pb was the main contributor to neurotoxicity. The results indicated that combined dietary exposure to Pb, Cd, As, and Hg may pose risks of neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, with the combined exposure likely amplifying this risk compared to exposure to individual heavy metal elements. mRPI proves to be a more suitable index for cumulative risk assessment using a hazard-driven approach compared to other indexes, as it is derived based on specific studies and endpoints. Introduction Findings based on human biomonitoring have demonstrated that human are exposed to chemicals via the air, water and food, which may pose a risk to our health. Over the last decade, regulatory bodies have attached importance to mixture risk assessment. A series of guidelines and technical documents have been published by scientific advisory bodies, e.g., European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) and World Health Organization (WHO) to stress the importance of evaluation of the potential combined toxicity of chemicals co-existing with humans and provide methodological guidance of mixture risk assessment 1 , 2 . However, due to the use of large amounts of chemicals and the limited information available on toxicity, as well as the infinite potential combinations, the evaluation of multi-chemicals remains challenging 3 . Recent scientific progress has contributed to a better understanding of mixture effects and the development of new approaches for assessing risks from joint exposures to mixtures. Substantial strides have been made in conceptual approaches to address mixture risks, and New Approach Methodologies (NAM) data have been considered as selectable sources of toxicity information potentially relevant to human health risk assessment. As one of the NAMs, Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) has recently presented itself as a crucial tool for classifying chemicals into evaluation groups and informing the evaluation of data-poor chemicals. While some evaluations of mixtures have been carried out by scientific bodies such as the Joint Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR), the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), and US EPA for food additives, pesticides, veterinary drugs, and co-occurring contaminants, most of them were limited to chemicals with similar structures and physicochemical properties. In May 2021, EFSA issued two methodological guidance documents on scientific criteria for grouping chemicals into assessment groups using hazard-driven criteria and methods of prioritization using exposure-driven and risk-based approaches 4 . Prior to that, EFSA Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR) published two scientific reports on the establishment of cumulative assessment groups of pesticides for their effects on the nervous system and the thyroid in 2020 5 , 6 . These documents may indicate an emerging paradigm shift in chemical mixture risk assessment. The human body can be exposed to various types of heavy metal elements simultaneously through ingestion, drinking water, air and skin contact. Numerous studies have shown that multiple heavy metal elements can be detected simultaneously in food, and biomarker-based studies confirm that the human body is chronically exposed to various heavy metals 7 , 8 . Beyond the risks associated with excessive exposure to a single element, simultaneous exposure to multiple heavy elements within permissible limits may also pose hazard. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have reported that co-exposure to low doses of metallic elements may lead to harmful effects, such as multiple organ damage and neurobehavioral alterations, which can result from exposure to cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and mercury (Hg), at environmental exposure levels 9 . Most heavy metal elements, including Cd, arsenic (As), Hg and Pb, can adversely affect the renal and nervous systems with prolonged low-dose exposure 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 . Studies indicated that co-exposure to Cd and Pb or As and Cd leads to more pronounced renal injury and dysfunction than exposure to each element alone. This early co-exposure may also contribute to the development of chronic renal disease (CKD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), or renal dysfunction 14 , 15 , 16 . A study by Wang et al. also showed that Pb, Cd, As and Hg damage the renal tubules, potentially leading to reduced glomerular filtration rate and/or tubular dysfunction, as well as other renal impairments 17 . Similarly, Claire et al.. found that Pb, Cd, As and Hg all affect the dopamine system in different ways, thereby interfering with normal neurotoxic function 18 . Moreover, several population-based studies suggested that long-term co-exposure to Pb, Cd, As and Hg is associated with kidney damage, cognitive impairment, and other damaging effects 7 , 19 . However, only a small number of studies have evaluated the cumulative risk of heavy metal elements. Almost all of them rely on subjective grouping approach or do not consider all substances in their risk calculations. This may lead to an overestimation of risk due to differences in the mode of toxic action and target organs among different metallic elements, or an underestimation resulting from limited number of elements in an assessment. Therefore, this study will adopt hazard-driven approach for risk assessment and primary screening of heavy metal elements based on exposure drivers, which may offer more accurate estimation of risk compared to other studies. Soil heavy metal pollution has emerged as a serious and widespread issue in China. The 2014 China Soil Pollution Survey showed that the exceeding standard rates of soil heavy metals was 16.1% 20 . Specifically, Cd, Hg, As and Pb inorganic pollutants exceed the China national standard levels at rates of 7.0%, 1.6%, 2.7%, and 1.5%, respectively 20 . Located in southwest China, Chongqing holds significant importance as an industrial center, a national historical and cultural city, a vital modern manufacturing base, an economic center in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and an international consumer center. Consequently, heavy metal pollution’s impact on the environment and food safety in Chongqing represents a crucial public health concern. Some studies have revealed varying degrees of Cd, As, Pb and Hg pollution in the soil of Chongqing’s main urban areas, as well as certain districts and counties 21 , 22 . Additionally, the rivers in the main urban areas of Chongqing have shown Cd, Cr (chromium), Cu (copper) and other metal levels reaching the threshold of mild pollution and higher, and the substrate has also been contaminated to some extent by heavy metal elements such as Pb and Cd 23 , 24 . According to a survey conducted by Wu et al. 25 , hazardous heavy metal elements such as Pb, Cd, and Hg were detected in over 50% of commercially available food products in Chongqing. Specifically, the detection rate of Cd in cereals and their products was 93.33%, while As was detected in 100.00% of aquatic animals and their products as well as milk and dairy products. Hg was found in 99.07% of milk and dairy products, and some samples exceeded the permissible standards. Therefore, in order to determine the level of heavy metal exposure and its associated health risks, there is an urgent need to conduct a cumulative risk assessment of Chongqing residents. In the present study, we performed a cumulative risk assessment of heavy metal contaminants among Chongqing residents using a hazard-driven approach. The research aimed to achieve two primary objectives: (1) quantifying the exposure levels of heavy metal contaminants in commonly available foods in Chongqing and assessing the potential cumulative health risk; (2) investigating the applicability of the method for risk characterization in cumulative risk assessment. Study findings will be used to inform policy interventions and food safety regulation in Chongqing. Additionally, they can contribute with the development of the method of multiple chemicals risk assessment. Materials and methods Screening and grouping of heavy metal elements In this study, we utilized the heavy metal pollutant monitoring data from the food safety risk monitoring system of Chongqing Municipality spanning from 2017 to 2021. Hazard data for heavy metal elements are collected from previous JECFA assessments and EFSA assessments, available open databases and published research papers (detailed retrieval process are shown in supplementary materials Appendix A). The heavy metal elements meeting our screening criteria were identified as the subjects of this study. Our selection criteria were guided by the following principles: a. b. Exclusion of heavy metal elements not concurrently monitored in the three most commonly consumed food categories (cereals and cereals products, vegetables and vegetables products, and meat and meat products); c. Exclusion of heavy metal elements with estimated dietary exposure below 10% of the relevant health-based guidance value (HBGV), applicable only to heavy metal elements with HBGV. Following this initial screening, the chosen heavy metal elements were categorized based on hazard driven principles, taking cues from EFSA Scientific Committee guidelines 26 . The categorization primarily adhered to the following principles: a. b. c. In cases where AOP/MOA information is missing or available, grouping chemicals that conduct a common toxic effect (e.g., impaired immune function) or exhibit similar target organ toxicity. Food contamination data All concentration data of heavy metal elements in food were obtained from the 2017–2021 China National Food Contamination Monitoring Program (The databases is closed and the data are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request). According to the China national standards, food samples were divided into 10 categories, including cereals and cereal products (rice, rice products, wheat grains and flour, wheat products, other cereal and cereal products), vegetables and vegetables products (leafy vegetables, root and tuber vegetables, stem vegetables, brassica vegetables, legumes vegetables, other fresh vegetables, vegetable products), nuts, fruits, beans and bean products (beans, bean products), meat and meat products (livestock meat, poultry meat, meat products, edible livestock and poultry offal), fish and their products, eggs and their products, milk and dairy based products, and foods for special dietary uses 27 . All food samples were collected using a multi-stage stratified random sampling method from retail stores, large and medium-sized supermarkets, grocery stores, farmers’ markets and convenience stores in 38 districts and counties of Chongqing. Sample handing and analysis In accordance with dietary habits, samples were collected from the edible portion of food. Solid samples, such as grain and beans, were cleaned of debris, crushed into uniform samples, and stored in sealed plastic bottles. Fresh samples, including vegetables, fruits, meat, fish, and eggs, were washed, dried, and the edible portions were homogenized into a paste. These were then stored in plastic bottles and kept in the refrigerator at -16 to -18 ℃ for future use. The samples were pre-treated and analyzed following national standards (e.g., GB 5009.11–2014, GB 5009.12–2017, GB 5009.15–2014, GB 5009.17–2014, GB 5009.123–2014 and GB 5009.268–2016 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 . Briefly, solid sample weighing 0.2 g to 0.5 g (accurate to 0.0001 g) or liquid sample measuring 1.0 mL to 3.0 mL were precisely transferred into the microwave digestion tank. Nitric acid (5 mL to 10 mL) was added, and the containers were covered and left for 1 h or overnight. Afterward, the digestion process was carried out according to the standard procedure. Once cooled, the containers were removed, and the volume was adjusted to the scale line using a 1% nitric acid solution or water. The contents were thoroughly mixed and set aside, with simultaneous blank testing. The heavy metal elements’ contents in food samples were subsequently analyzed by a qualified regional laboratory under the local Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This analysis was conducted using Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS) or Atomic Fluorescence Spectrometry (AFS), or Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). All operations followed the standard operating procedures (SOP) established by the organizers. Uniform quality control and oversight is provided by the National Monitoring Program of China (NMPC). Each laboratory must comply with the quality control requirements, including the simultaneous analysis of certified reference materials alongside the samples. All data are ultimately sent to the NMPC and rechecked before they were used. Concentration conversion method The data on Hg and As were analyzed as total Hg and total As. Conversion factors are used to derive inorganic As (iAs) from total As data and methylmercury (MeHg) or inorganic Hg (iHg) levels from total Hg data. According to a study by Suomi et al. 34 , 2% of the total As is iAs in fish and 70% in other foods. For Hg, the assumptions aligned with those used by EFSA 13 . Assuming that the conversion coefficient between total Hg and MeHg in fish is 100%; in the food group other than fish, the conversion coefficient between total Hg and MeHg is 0%. Assuming that the conversion coefficient between total Hg and iHg in fish is 20%; in the food group other than fish, the conversion coefficient between total mercury and iHg is 100%. Consumption data sources The dietary consumption data was obtained from the 2018 China Health and Nutrition Survey of Chongqing municipality. A total of 969 study participants were surveyed from 6 survey sites (Shapingba, Fengjie, Dazu, Jiangjin, Qijiang, Nanan districts or counties of Chongqing) using multi-stage stratified random sampling approach. Among the respondents, 432 (44.6%) were male and 537 (55.4%) were female. The age distribution included 31 preschoolers aged 3 to 6 (3.2%), 113 adolescents aged 7 to 17 (11.7%), 399 adults aged 18 to 59 (41.2%) and 426 adults aged 60 or older (43.9%). The survey was conducted using a three-day, 24-h dietary recall method, in which well-trained dietary surveyors visited households daily to collect information on what individuals were eating. For survey respondent under 7 years old or over 75 years old, dietary information was obtained from adult family members. The food consumption of each food category consumed by each survey respondent during the survey period was summed up to calculate the average food consumption of each food category. Ethical approval This study was conducted in accordance with the approval of the Chongqing Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KY-2023-024-2). All methods were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations and informed consent was obtained from all participants and/or their legal guardians. Exposure risk assessment method Methods for handling left-censored data To account for uncertainties arising from left-censored data, lower bounds (LB), median bound (MB) and upper bounds (UB) were calculated. According to EFSA’s recommended treatment for left-censored data 35 , values below the limit of detection (LOD) were set to zero in the LB, 1/2 LOD in the MB and LOD in the UB. Two scenarios were estimated for Chongqing residents, mean and high exposure. In a high exposure scenario, we assumed that 95th percentile of individual exposure levels would substitute for high exposure. Exposure assessment The dietary exposure to heavy metals per kilogram per day for an individual was calculated using the following formula: $$\\:EDI={\\sum\\:}_{j=1}^{n}\\frac{{F}_{j}\\times\\:{C}_{j}}{{BW}_{i}}$$ where the estimated daily intake (EDI) refers to the level of dietary exposure to heavy metals per kilogram of body weight per day for individual (i); Cj is the level of heavy metal contamination in food category j (µg/kg); Fj is the daily consumption of food category j (g/d); BWi is the body weight of an individual (i). Risk characterization The cumulative health risk of Chongqing residents from dietary exposure to heavy metals was assessed using the modified Reference Point Index (mRPI) method, which is an easily applicable and transparent food pollutant accumulation risk assessment method 36 , 37 . Moreover, mRPI combines the advantages of both Hazard Index and Reference Point Index methods. This approach uses dose addition as a default assumption and does not consider interactions between substances. The reference point index of a single element pollutant is called the reference point quotient (RPQ). The reference point quotient is the ratio of estimated daily intake (EDI) to toxicological reference points (RP), calculated using the following formula: $$\\:{RPQ}_{i}=\\frac{{EDI}_{i}\\times\\:{UF}_{i}}{{RP}_{i}}$$ where RPQi is the reference point quotient of element i; RPi represents a specific toxicity endpoint or toxicological reference point for a specific critical event of element i; UFi represents the uncertainty coefficient of the corresponding toxicological reference point for element i. To assess the potential cumulative risk for each endpoint posed by more than one heavy metal, the adverse health risks that would result from a hypothetical sub-threshold exposure to several heavy metals at the same time are expressed in terms of the mRPI. The mRPI is the sum of the RPQ for each individual heavy metal: $$mRPI = RP{Q_1} + RP{Q_{\\text{2}}} + RP{Q_3} + \\ldots \\ldots + RP{Q_n}.$$ If the mRPI value greater than 1 indicates an unacceptable combined risk, suggesting that prolonged exposure to this level is likely to lead to adverse health effects. Conversely, the mRPI value less than 1 indicates an acceptable combined risk, suggesting that the adverse health effects are unlikely to occur. Monte Carlo simulation method of health risk assessment While deterministic exposure assessment is widely used in health risk assessment, it can introduce extra uncertainty. To achieve a more precise estimation of the exposure level, the probabilistic assessment method, as recommended by the WHO/IPCS 38 , was adopted in this study. The Monte Carlo method (MCS) was utilized with the @RISK software v8.2 (from Palisade Coporation, Ithaca, NY, USA) using Latin hypercube sampling. As the probability distributions of the food samples may not follow normal or log-normal patterns due to the relatively small sample sizes for some foods, the @RISK software was employed to fit the distribution of food samples. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used to select the optimal function curve for describing the contaminant levels, and the mean was used to express the concentrations of heavy metal in foods. The statistical results were found to be stable when 100,000 Monte Carlo iterations were computed for each analysis, combining individual consumption and concentration data in a probabilistic manner. The health risk evaluation was based on the mean and 95th percentile values of the mRPI obtained from the simulation. Statistical analysis Data cleansing was performed by Excel 2016. Distributional fitting of heavy metal concentrations and food consumption, along with probabilistic assessments, was performed using the statistical software @RISK v8.2 (from Palisade Coporation, Ithaca, NY, USA). Heavy metal concentrations and food consumption expressed as both the mean and the 95th percentile. Results and discussion Results of screening and grouping for heavy elements Between 2017 and 2021, the Chongqing Food Safety Risk Monitoring System monitored 27 heavy metal elements, including Pb, Cd, As, Hg, Cr, Cu, praseodymium (Pr), neodymium(Nd), terbium (Tb), dysprosium (Dy), selenium (Se), europium (Eu), antimony (Sb), tin (Sn), vanadium (V), manganese (Mn), erbium (Er), cerium (Ce), samarium (Sm), ytterbium (Yb), lanthanum (La), promethium (Pm), holmium (Ho), lutetium (Lu), thulium (Tm), gadolinium(Gd) and nickel (Ni). Based on the screening principles described above, the elements Pm, Gd, Dy, Er, Ho, Yb, Ce, Sm, Lu, Nd, Eu, Tm, Pr, Tb and La were excluded due to a lack of toxicity information. The elements Ni, Cu, Se, V, Mn, Sb, and Sn were excluded due to incomplete monitoring in food groups. Dietary exposure to chromium below 10% of its health guideline value (TDI, 300 µg Cr(III)/kg b.w. per day) 39 was also excluded. Finally, the elements considered for assessment were Pb, Cd, As, Hg (Fig. 1 ). It’s worth noting that for Hg, both inorganic Hg (iHg) and organic Hg compounds, especially the methyl form (MeHg), have different toxicities. iHg primarily affects the kidneys, while MeHg targets the nervous system. Therefore, they were considered separately in this study. Additionally, it’s worth mentioning that the most toxic forms of As are its inorganic compounds, whereas some organic As compounds are relatively non-toxic. Therefore, this study exclusively focused on inorganic As (iAs). Fig. 1 We use the weight of evidence (WoE) approach approach for grouping chemicals into assessment groups using hazard-driven criteria. For full details, the reader is referred to the Fig S1 . Compiling the collected hazard data, including specific effects from subchronic toxicity studies, associated target organs, and reference points for Pb, Cd, As, and Hg, into evidence fragments and lines of evidence, we identified specific dose-response relationships for Pb, Cd, iAs, Hg in the kidney and nervous system, as shown in Table 1 . In addition, epidemiological data also suggested a causal relationship between Pb, Cd, As, Hg and kidney and nervous system damage 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 . While the mechanisms and adverse outcome pathways of neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity remain unknown, they probably share similarities, as they act on the same cellular processes, such as oxidative stress or enzyme disruption due to metal replacement. For each chemical Pb, Cd, As and Hg, a semi-quantitative scale was applied to the weighing and integration of the four LOEs while assessing reliability, relevance and consistency of each LOE as low (*), moderate (**) and high (***). Expert judgement was then applied to conclude on the probability of membership to the assessment group (Table S9). Table S10 and Fig S2 summarise the WoE assessment for the grouping of chemicals Pb, Cd, As and Hg (associated with neurological damage) into common assessment group neurotoxicity and Pb, Cd, As and Hg (associated with renal damage) into common assessment groups nephrotoxicity. Table 1 Toxicological reference points (RP) on nephrotoxic and neurotoxicity effects and determined uncertainty factors (UF). Methodology discussion In a person’s life, we are constantly exposed to low concentrations of chemical mixtures over extended periods. Government agencies and international organizations, such as WHO/IPCS, EFSA, and the EPA, have recognized the adverse health risks of exposure to mixtures and proposed frameworks and guidance for assessing the cumulative risk of exposure to such chemicals 40 , 41 , 42 . Nevertheless, some limitations and challenges to the current approach remain to be addressed. These include the insufficient availability of toxicity study data for most evaluated substances, the absence of a cumulative risk assessment methodology for evaluating interactions, and a lack of accurate and effective grouping methods 1 . Recently, EFSA issued two methodological guidance documents to harmonize the risk assessment approach for joint exposures to multi-chemicals. The first document outlines principles for risk assessment of joint exposure to multi-chemicals and explores the methodology of risk assessment implementation 2 . The second guidance document provides scientific criteria for grouping chemicals into assessment groups, utilizing hazard-driven criteria and prioritization methods based on exposure and risk 26 . The hazard-driven approach addresses the limitations of inaccurate grouping, which may lead to overestimation or underestimation in risk assessment. This approach is based on the component-based method, which employs dose addition as the default assumption 43 . Currently, several methods are used in the component-based approach to determine risk, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. These include relative potency factor (RPF), reference point index (RPI), point of departure Index (PODI), hazard index (HI), toxic equivalency factor (TEF) and combined margin of exposure (MOET) 40 , 42 , 44 . The mRPI was chosen for this study. HI is calculated by summing the exposure to each chemical divided by its respective reference dose (RfD) and is commonly used in cumulative risk assessment 40 , 45 . However, the RfD is derived from health guideline values based on the most sensitive endpoint. Since toxic endpoints cannot be considered separately, HI may not be as applicable for a hazard-driven approach. TEF and RPF belong to normalization methods and depend on selection an index chemical to normalize the potencies of other members in the group. TEF has been used for dioxins and other aryl hydrocarbons, while RPF was mainly used for pesticides 46 , 47 . In recent studies, the RPF method has also been applied to assess the accumulation risk of heavy metals 17 , 34 . However, RPF is generally not suitable for food contaminants due to the lack of well-founded toxicological data on relative potency or compound interactions. The RPF method depends heavily on the adequacy of the chemical toxicology data and the choice of the indicator chemical. mRPI can be seen as an extension of RPI or PODI, with the main difference being the proposal of a corresponding uncertainty factor for each substance in mRPI, while RPI or PODI uses a single overall uncertainty factor 30 , 48 . The mRPI method improves risk estimation accuracy by defining the uncertainty factor based on specific studies and endpoints, suggesting that it might be a more appropriate method for cumulative risk assessment based on a hazard-driven approach. Concentrations of heavy metals in diverse food The mean values for four heavy metal elements are shown in Table 2 , and the P95 and function fit results are shown in Table S1 -S4. The mean concentration of Pb in foodstuffs was 0.0194–0.0295 mg/kg, with a total detection rate of 29.7%. These values were lower than the mean concentration of Pb in foodstuffs (0.0433 mg/kg) and the total detection rate (71.6%) of 6,339 food samples in Guangzhou from 2014 to 2017 49 . Pb concentration varied significantly among different food categories. Dried legumes had the highest mean concentration of lead (0.0668–0.0975 mg/kg), followed by nuts (0.0584–0.0601 mg/kg), leafy vegetables (0.0476–0.0597 mg/kg) and rice products (0.0471–0.0543 mg/kg), and the lowest mean level was found in milk and dairy based products (0.0064–0.0159 mg/kg). Among them, the mean concentration levels of rice, leafy vegetables, root and tuber vegetables, and eggs and their products were lower than the levels found in similar foods in Jiangsu Province from 2007 to 2010 50 . This study also revealed that Pb concentrations in cereals and cereal products (0.0211–0.0354 mg/kg), vegetables and vegetable products (0.0238–0.0336 mg/kg), and meat and meat products (0.0140–0.0237 mg/kg) were higher than those reported by Malavolti et al. (0.0114, 0.0249, 0.0125 mg/kg) 51 and Pan et al. (0.005–0.012, 0.017–0.022, 0.014–0.018 mg/kg) 52 . According to the maximum levels of contaminants in food published by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China / the China Market Supervision Administration 27 , the mean concentrations of Pb in all food categories were below the prescribed legal limits. Similarly, the mean concentrations of Pb in all types of vegetables, fruits, rice, livestock meat, poultry meat, fish and milk and dairy based products were below the permitted maximum levels or guideline levels for contaminants in food established by the Codex Alimentarius Commission 53 . Table 2 Lower, median and upper bound of the mean concentration of heavy metals in diverse food categories. Cd contamination in food is widespread. As shown in Table 2 , the mean concentration of Cd in 5206 food samples ranged from 0.0219 to 0.0228 mg/kg, and the overall detection rate was 53.7%. These values were lower than the mean concentration of Cd in 4039 food samples (0.159 mg/kg) and the overall detection rate (76.1%) reported in Guangzhou from 2013 to 2015 54 , as well as the mean concentration of Cd in 228,687 food samples (0.049 mg/kg) and the overall detection rate (64.3%) reported in China from 2011 to 2015 55 . A comparison of elemental Cd concentrations in foodstuffs showed significant variations among different types of food. Nuts had the highest concentration of 0.2383 mg/kg, which was much higher than the value reported by Song et al. (0.029 mg/kg) 55 . This was followed by edible livestock and poultry offal (0.0919–0.1462 mg/kg) and the rice products (0.0740–0.0742 mg/kg), while the lowest mean levels were found in livestock meat (0.0007–0.0025 mg/kg). Other food categories ranged from 0.0014 to 0.0527 mg/kg. Plant-derived foods such as cereals and vegetables, especially rice and leafy vegetables, are usually the main sources of chronic Cd exposure in the diet due to the high absorption capacity of Cd by plants 56 . The mean Cd concentration in rice (0.0497–0.0502 mg/kg) in this study was lower than the Maximum Allowable Levels (MAL) set by the China Market Supervision Administration (0.2 mg/kg) 27 or the Codex Alimentarius Commission (0.4 mg/kg) 53 , but higher than the levels found in Bangladesh (0.044 mg/kg), Cambodia (0.006 mg/kg), Italy (0.038 mg/kg), and France (0.01 mg/kg) 57 . This suggests that cadmium needs constant attention. The mean levels of Cd in all vegetable varieties under the three scenarios of LB, MB, and UB were lower than the MALs set by the China Market Supervision Administration (0.1–0.2 mg/kg) 27 or CAC (0.05–0.2 mg/kg) 53 . As is present in food in both inorganic and organic forms, and inorganic arsenic is more toxic than organic arsenic 58 . As data obtained in NMPC was total As, the As concentrations presented in the article refer to total As. The results showed that the mean concentrations of As in 4345 food were 0.0206–0.0403 mg/kg, with an overall detection rate of 36.5%. The highest As levels in all food categories were found in fish and their products (0.0811–0.1180 mg/kg), which were higher than those found in fish from a town in Jiangsu Province (0.05 mg/kg) in China 59 , but lower than those found in fish from European countries (1.4526–1.4529 mg/kg) 11 . According to the latest national standard in China, the MAL of As in fish and their products is 0.1 mg/kg 27 , and the level of As contamination under the UB scenario exceeds this limit. Seafood is considered a major source of As in the human diet, highlighting the importance of addressing As contamination in fish and their products. Rice (0.0838–0.0848 mg/kg) and rice products (0.0447–0.0459 mg/kg) followed with relatively high As levels, while brassica vegetables had the lowest mean levels (0.0001–0.0077 mg/kg). Rice is one of the main staple foods in China. According to the study by EFSA 60 , grains, particularly rice and rice products, are a significant source of human dietary exposure to As. Compared to other regions in China, the mean As content in rice was lower than that in a town in Jiangsu Province (0.104 mg/kg) 59 , Chengdu (0.188 mg/kg) 61 , and Taiwan (0.17 mg/kg) 62 , but higher than that in Jilin Province (0.04 mg/kg) 63 . Compared to foreign countries, the mean As content in rice was lower than that in Vietnam (0.115 mg/kg) 64 , Iran (0.16 mg/kg) and Mexico (0.18 mg/kg) 65 , but higher than that in Nepal (0.0434 mg/kg) 66 , Sri Lanka (0.077 mg/kg) 67 . In order to reduce the potential health risks associated with As intake, it is recommended that the relevant authorities further strengthen the monitoring and management of arsenic contamination in rice, fish and their products. The mean level of Hg in 4378 foods samples was 0.0024–0.0039 mg/kg, significantly lower than the levels of the other three heavy metals included, with an overall detection rate of 22.1%. In this study, the lowest mean Hg levels were found in legumes vegetables (0.0006–0.0025 mg/kg) while the highest mean levels were found in fish and their products (0.0184–0.0285 mg/kg). These levels were lower than the mean concentrations of Hg in fish from Guangxi (0.04 mg/kg) and Hainan (0.04 mg/kg) in China, as reported by Wang et al. 68 , and in fish and their products from Finland (0.085–0.199 mg/kg), as reported by the Suomi et al. 69 . Furthermore, the mean concentrations of Hg in cereals and cereal products (0.002–0.0036 mg/kg), vegetables and vegetable products (0.0011–0.0027 mg/kg), meat and meat products (0.0024–0.0057 mg/kg), milk and dairy based products (0.0011–0.0026 mg/kg), eggs and their products (0.0012–0.0031 mg/kg) and fruits (0. 001–0.0028 mg/kg) were lower than those found in similar foods in the study by Qing et al. 70 . Food consumption of the survey Based on the summary of the questionnaire, the daily consumption of different food categories among Chongqing residents in this study is shown in Table 3 (detailed information and function fitting results are shown in Table S5). Except for nuts and food for special dietary uses, the 3-day consumption of various food categories ranged from 48.99 g to 972.41 g. The ranking of the eight categories was as follows: cereals and cereal products > vegetable and vegetable products > meat and meat products > milk and dairy based products > fruits > fish and their products > eggs and their products > beans and bean products. By comparison 45 , the average consumption of cereals and cereal products is basically consistent with the Yangtze River Delta region (331 g/d), lower than Beijing (422 g/d), while the average consumption of vegetable and vegetable products is lower than Beijing (491 g/d) and the recommended value of the 2016 Chinese Dietary Guidelines (400 g/d), and higher than the national average level of 2020 (270 g/d); the average consumption of meat and meat products is higher than the national average in 2020 (74 g/d) and Beijing (115 g/d). The 2022 Chinese Dietary Guidelines recommend consuming 200–300 g of fresh fruits, 300 g of dairy or dairy products, and 50 g of eggs per day 71 . Overall, the intake of fruits, milk and dairy based products, eggs, and beans and bean products is relatively low. It is recommended that residents in Chongqing increase their intake of those foods in the future. Notably, the residents of Chongqing reported zero consumption of nuts and nut products as well as baby food. This could be attributed to various factors such as seasonal influences, individual dietary habits, and the timing of the survey. Table 3 Daily food consumption of Chongqing residents (g/3 day). Health risk assessment of dietary heavy metal exposure The mRPI values for neurotoxic effect at mean exposure and high exposure levels for the four included heavy metals in 24 types of commercially available foods were 0–0.383 and 0–1.279 (Fig. 2 ), respectively (detailed mRPI results are shown in Table S6-S8). These values were calculated based on toxicological reference points derived from benchmark dose lower bound on neurotoxic effects. The mRPI values for nephrotoxic effect at mean exposure and high exposure levels were 0–0.503 and 0–1.611 (Fig. 3 ), respectively. These values were calculated based on toxicological reference points derived from benchmark dose lower bound or no observed adverse effect level on nephrotoxic effect. Fig. 2 The mRPI values of heavy metals from 24 types of food for neurotoxicity in Chongqing residents. (a, c, e) Average exposure level (mean). (b, d, f) High exposure level (P95). Compared to the mRPI values for neurotoxic effect, the mRPI values of nephrotoxic effect in all types of food were higher than that in neurotoxic. The mRPI values of neurotoxic effect and nephrotoxic effect in all single types of foods were well below 1 at the mean exposure level, while the mRPI values for the neurotoxic effects of rice and the nephrotoxic effects of rice and leafy vegetables were greater than 1 at high exposure level. This indicated that consumption single types of foods had a low likelihood of posing a risk of nephrotoxic or neurotoxic effect at the mean exposure level. However, at high exposure levels, consumption rice or leafy vegetables alone may potentially cause health damage to the nervous and urinary system. This finding suggested higher potential health risks associated with dietary heavy metal exposure in populations with high exposure levels. It can also be seen from Figs. 2 and 3 that among all the foods investigated, rice, leafy vegetables and wheat flour products were the top three foods affecting both neurotoxic and nephrotoxic effects. The combined mRPI values for neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, classified by the included heavy metals, are presented in Figs. 4 and 5 , respectively (detailed mRPI results are shown in Table S6-S8). For neurotoxicity, the RPQ/mRPI ranges were as follows: 0.643–3.462 for Pb, 0.116–0.866 for Cd, 0.112–0.480 for iAs, 0.001–0.035 for MeHg, and 0.922–4.835 for mRPI (Fig. 4 ). Based on these findings, the order of risk for individual heavy metals can be listed as Pb > Cd > As > Hg. At mean exposure levels in both the MB and UB scenarios, the RPQs for neurotoxicity from individual heavy metal element exposures did not exceed 1. However, the mRPIs for mean exposure levels exceeded 1. In high-exposure level scenarios, the mRPI values for neurotoxicity associated with the four metals consistently exceeded 1, even under the best-case scenario (LB). The results suggested that there may be a potential neurotoxic risk from the cumulative exposure of heavy metal for local populations via the daily dietary. It is worth noting that at high exposure levels, the RPQ for Pb exceeded 1 in the LB, MB, and UB scenarios, indicating a potential neurotoxic risk for the residents of Chongqing at high exposure levels. Fig. 4 The mRPI values for neurotoxicity calculated by 24 types of food for Pb, Cd, iAs, MeHg and total 4 heavy metals in Chongqing residents. (a, c, e) Average exposure level (mean). (b, d, f) High exposure level (P95). For nephrotoxicity, the combined mRPIs were as follows: 0.510–2.748 for Pb, 0.784–4.223 for Cd, 0.007–0.029 for iAs, 0.005–0.032 for iHg, and 0.922–4.835 for mRPI (Fig. 5 ). Based on these values, the order of risk for individual heavy metals was Cd > Pb > Hg > As. In both the mean and high exposure levels in LB/MB/UB scenarios, the combined PRI values for the nephrotoxicity exceeded 1. This indicates that there might be a potential nephrotoxic risk for residents (both the mean and high exposure levels) form the cumulative exposure of heavy metal via the daily dietary. Furthermore, for nephrotoxicity, the potential health risk is mainly attributed to two elements, Pb and Cd. The RPQ values for Cd exceeded 1 under LB/MB/UB for the mean exposure scenario, and the RPQ values for both Pb and Cd exceeded 1 under LB/MB/UB for the high-exposure scenario, indicating that these two elements pose a potential nephrotoxic risk individually. Additionally, when considering common target organs, the co-exposure may leads to an increased risk of kidney injury. Comparing the combined mRPI values for neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, the combined mRPI value of nephrotoxicity was higher. This suggested that potential nephrotoxic risks through diverse food consumption may be more severe than neurotoxic risks. Contributions of heavy metals and foods to neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity The relative contributions of heavy metals to neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity at mean exposure level are presented in Fig. 6 . For neurotoxicity, Pb was the primary contributor to the mRPI (69.74 − 72.22%), followed by Cd with 17.44 − 18.05%. The contribution of As (represented by iAs) to the mRPI ranged from 9.24 to 12.13%, while Hg (represented by MeHg) accounted for less than 1%. Limiting exposure to Pb, as the major contributor to neurotoxicity, would have a more significant impact on protecting consumers from nervous system injury by heavy metals. Regarding nephrotoxicity, Cd was the main contributor to the total mRPI, accounting for 60.05 − 60.09%. Pb accounted for 39.08–39.01% of the mRPI at mean exposure level. The combined contribution of Hg (represented by iHg) and As (represented by iAs) is less than 1%. Clearly, Pb and Cd contributed more than 80% of the mRPI and were the dominant sources of risk for kidney and nervous system injury. The results of the above study were similar to the research reported by Wang et al. and Suomi et al. 17 , 34 . The contributions of different foodstuffs to the PRI values for neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity were calculated at the mean exposure level (Fig. 7 ). For neurotoxicity, rice was the primary contributor to the mRPI values in all three exposure scenarios (26.8%, 29.71% and 26.18% for the LB, MB, and UB, respectively). Leafy vegetables ranked second, followed by wheat products, all surpassing 10% in contribution. Other food categories made relatively lower contributions, ranging from less than 8.74%. Regarding nephrotoxicity, all food categories exhibited similar contributions to the mRPI values as in neurotoxicity and rice, leafy vegetables and wheat products are the primary contributor. Other food categories made relatively lower contributions, less than 10%. In the present study, the combined contribution of rice and various vegetables ranged from 61.29 to 67.29%, indicating that the consumption of rice and vegetables contributes significantly to the overall risk. This because the main feature of the traditional Chinese dietary structure is the high consumption of rice and vegetables, which are prone to absorbing heavy metal elements from soil, such as Cd 72 .

      "# [Monte Carlo tree search by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2013-09-14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search)\nHeuristic search algorithm for evaluating game trees\n\nMonte Carlo tree searchClassSearch algorithm\n\nIn computer science, Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) is a heuristic search algorithm for some kinds of decision processes, most notably those employed in software that plays board games. In that context MCTS is used to solve the game tree.\n\nMCTS was combined with neural networks in 2016[1] and has been used in multiple board games like Chess, Shogi,[2] Checkers, Backgammon, Contract Bridge, Go, Scrabble, and Clobber[3] as well as in turn-based-strategy video games (such as Total War: Rome II's implementation in the high level campaign AI[4]) and applications outside of games.[5]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nMonte Carlo method\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Monte Carlo method, which uses random sampling for deterministic problems which are difficult or impossible to solve using other approaches, dates back to the 1940s.[6] In his 1987 PhD thesis, Bruce Abramson combined minimax search with an expected-outcome model based on random game playouts to the end, instead of the usual static evaluation function. Abramson said the expected-outcome model \"is shown to be precise, accurate, easily estimable, efficiently calculable, and domain-independent.\"[7] He experimented in-depth with tic-tac-toe and then with machine-generated evaluation functions for Othello and chess.\n\nSuch methods were then explored and successfully applied to heuristic search in the field of automated theorem proving by W. Ertel, J. Schumann and C. Suttner in 1989,[8][9][10] thus improving the exponential search times of uninformed search algorithms such as e.g. breadth-first search, depth-first search or iterative deepening.\n\nIn 1992, B. Brügmann employed it for the first time in a Go-playing program.[11] In 2002, Chang et al.[12] proposed the idea of \"recursive rolling out and backtracking\" with \"adaptive\" sampling choices in their Adaptive Multi-stage Sampling (AMS) algorithm for the model of Markov decision processes. AMS was the first work to explore the idea of UCB-based exploration and exploitation in constructing sampled/simulated (Monte Carlo) trees and was the main seed for UCT (Upper Confidence Trees).[13]\n\nMonte Carlo tree search (MCTS)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2006, inspired by its predecessors,[15] Rémi Coulom described the application of the Monte Carlo method to game-tree search and coined the name Monte Carlo tree search,[16] L. Kocsis and Cs. Szepesvári developed the UCT (Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees) algorithm,[17] and S. Gelly et al. implemented UCT in their program MoGo.[18] In 2008, MoGo achieved dan (master) level in 9×9 Go,[19] and the Fuego program began to win against strong amateur players in 9×9 Go.[20]\n\nIn January 2012, the Zen program won 3:1 in a Go match on a 19×19 board with an amateur 2 dan player.[21] Google Deepmind developed the program AlphaGo, which in October 2015 became the first Computer Go program to beat a professional human Go player without handicaps on a full-sized 19x19 board.[1][22][23] In March 2016, AlphaGo was awarded an honorary 9-dan (master) level in 19×19 Go for defeating Lee Sedol in a five-game match with a final score of four games to one.[24] AlphaGo represents a significant improvement over previous Go programs as well as a milestone in machine learning as it uses Monte Carlo tree search with artificial neural networks (a deep learning method) for policy (move selection) and value, giving it efficiency far surpassing previous programs.[25]\n\nMCTS algorithm has also been used in programs that play other board games (for example Hex,[26] Havannah,[27] Game of the Amazons,[28] and Arimaa[29]), real-time video games (for instance Ms. Pac-Man[30][31] and Fable Legends[32]), and nondeterministic games (such as skat,[33] poker,[34] Magic: The Gathering,[35] or Settlers of Catan[36]).\n\nPrinciple of operation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe focus of MCTS is on the analysis of the most promising moves, expanding the search tree based on random sampling of the search space. The application of Monte Carlo tree search in games is based on many playouts, also called roll-outs. In each playout, the game is played out to the very end by selecting moves at random. The final game result of each playout is then used to weight the nodes in the game tree so that better nodes are more likely to be chosen in future playouts.\n\nThe most basic way to use playouts is to apply the same number of playouts after each legal move of the current player, then choose the move which led to the most victories.[11] The efficiency of this method—called Pure Monte Carlo Game Search—often increases with time as more playouts are assigned to the moves that have frequently resulted in the current player's victory according to previous playouts. Each round of Monte Carlo tree search consists of four steps:[37]\n\nSelection: Start from root R and select successive child nodes until a leaf node L is reached. The root is the current game state and a leaf is any node that has a potential child from which no simulation (playout) has yet been initiated. The section below says more about a way of biasing choice of child nodes that lets the game tree expand towards the most promising moves, which is the essence of Monte Carlo tree search.\n\nExpansion: Unless L ends the game decisively (e.g. win/loss/draw) for either player, create one (or more) child nodes and choose node C from one of them. Child nodes are any valid moves from the game position defined by L.\n\nSimulation: Complete one random playout from node C. This step is sometimes also called playout or rollout. A playout may be as simple as choosing uniform random moves until the game is decided (for example in chess, the game is won, lost, or drawn).\n\nBackpropagation: Use the result of the playout to update information in the nodes on the path from C to R.\n\nThis graph shows the steps involved in one decision, with each node showing the ratio of wins to total playouts from that point in the game tree for the player that the node represents.[38] In the Selection diagram, black is about to move. The root node shows there are 11 wins out of 21 playouts for white from this position so far. It complements the total of 10/21 black wins shown along the three black nodes under it, each of which represents a possible black move. Note that this graph does not follow the UCT algorithm described below.\n\nIf white loses the simulation, all nodes along the selection incremented their simulation count (the denominator), but among them only the black nodes were credited with wins (the numerator). If instead white wins, all nodes along the selection would still increment their simulation count, but among them only the white nodes would be credited with wins. In games where draws are possible, a draw causes the numerator for both black and white to be incremented by 0.5 and the denominator by 1. This ensures that during selection, each player's choices expand towards the most promising moves for that player, which mirrors the goal of each player to maximize the value of their move.\n\nRounds of search are repeated as long as the time allotted to a move remains. Then the move with the most simulations made (i.e. the highest denominator) is chosen as the final answer.\n\nPure Monte Carlo game search\n\n[edit]\n\nThis basic procedure can be applied to any game whose positions necessarily have a finite number of moves and finite length. For each position, all feasible moves are determined: k random games are played out to the very end, and the scores are recorded. The move leading to the best score is chosen. Ties are broken by fair coin flips. Pure Monte Carlo Game Search results in strong play in several games with random elements, as in the game EinStein würfelt nicht!. It converges to optimal play (as k tends to infinity) in board filling games with random turn order, for instance in the game Hex with random turn order.[39] DeepMind's AlphaZero replaces the simulation step with an evaluation based on a neural network.[2]\n\nExploration and exploitation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe main difficulty in selecting child nodes is maintaining some balance between the exploitation of deep variants after moves with high average win rate and the exploration of moves with few simulations. The first formula for balancing exploitation and exploration in games, called UCT (Upper Confidence Bound 1 applied to trees), was introduced by Levente Kocsis and Csaba Szepesvári.[17] UCT is based on the UCB1 formula derived by Auer, Cesa-Bianchi, and Fischer[40] and the probably convergent AMS (Adaptive Multi-stage Sampling) algorithm first applied to multi-stage decision-making models (specifically, Markov Decision Processes) by Chang, Fu, Hu, and Marcus.[12] Kocsis and Szepesvári recommend to choose in each node of the game tree the move for which the expression w i n i + c ln ⁡ N i n i {\\displaystyle {\\frac {w_{i}}{n_{i}}}+c{\\sqrt {\\frac {\\ln N_{i}}{n_{i}}}}} has the highest value. In this formula:\n\nwi stands for the number of wins for the node considered after the i-th move\n\nni stands for the number of simulations for the node considered after the i-th move\n\nNi stands for the total number of simulations after the i-th move run by the parent node of the one considered\n\nc is the exploration parameter—theoretically equal to √2; in practice usually chosen empirically\n\nThe first component of the formula above corresponds to exploitation; it is high for moves with high average win ratio. The second component corresponds to exploration; it is high for moves with few simulations.\n\nMost contemporary implementations of Monte Carlo tree search are based on some variant of UCT that traces its roots back to the AMS simulation optimization algorithm for estimating the value function in finite-horizon Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) introduced by Chang et al.[12] (2005) in Operations Research. (AMS was the first work to explore the idea of UCB-based exploration and exploitation in constructing sampled/simulated (Monte Carlo) trees and was the main seed for UCT.[13])\n\nAdvantages and disadvantages\n\n[edit]\n\nAlthough it has been proven that the evaluation of moves in Monte Carlo tree search converges to minimax when using UCT,[17][41] the basic version of Monte Carlo tree search converges only in so called \"Monte Carlo Perfect\" games.[42] However, Monte Carlo tree search does offer significant advantages over alpha–beta pruning and similar algorithms that minimize the search space.\n\nIn particular, pure Monte Carlo tree search does not need an explicit evaluation function. Simply implementing the game's mechanics is sufficient to explore the search space (i.e. the generating of allowed moves in a given position and the game-end conditions). As such, Monte Carlo tree search can be employed in games without a developed theory or in general game playing.\n\nThe game tree in Monte Carlo tree search grows asymmetrically as the method concentrates on the more promising subtrees. Thus[dubious – discuss], it achieves better results than classical algorithms in games with a high branching factor.\n\nA disadvantage is that in certain positions, there may be moves that look superficially strong, but that actually lead to a loss via a subtle line of play. Such \"trap states\" require thorough analysis to be handled correctly, particularly when playing against an expert player; however, MCTS may not \"see\" such lines due to its policy of selective node expansion.[43][44] It is believed that this may have been part of the reason for AlphaGo's loss in its fourth game against Lee Sedol. In essence, the search attempts to prune sequences which are less relevant. In some cases, a play can lead to a very specific line of play which is significant, but which is overlooked when the tree is pruned, and this outcome is therefore \"off the search radar\".[45]\n\nImprovements\n\n[edit]\n\nVarious modifications of the basic Monte Carlo tree search method have been proposed to shorten the search time. Some employ domain-specific expert knowledge, others do not.\n\nMonte Carlo tree search can use either light or heavy playouts. Light playouts consist of random moves while heavy playouts apply various heuristics to influence the choice of moves. These heuristics may employ the results of previous playouts (e.g. the Last Good Reply heuristic[46]) or expert knowledge of a given game. For instance, in many Go-playing programs certain stone patterns in a portion of the board influence the probability of moving into that area.[18] Paradoxically, playing suboptimally in simulations sometimes makes a Monte Carlo tree search program play stronger overall.[47]\n\nDomain-specific knowledge may be employed when building the game tree to help the exploitation of some variants. One such method assigns nonzero priors to the number of won and played simulations when creating each child node, leading to artificially raised or lowered average win rates that cause the node to be chosen more or less frequently, respectively, in the selection step.[48] A related method, called progressive bias, consists in adding to the UCB1 formula a b i n i {\\displaystyle {\\frac {b_{i}}{n_{i}}}} element, where bi is a heuristic score of the i-th move.[37]\n\nThe basic Monte Carlo tree search collects enough information to find the most promising moves only after many rounds; until then its moves are essentially random. This exploratory phase may be reduced significantly in a certain class of games using RAVE (Rapid Action Value Estimation).[48] In these games, permutations of a sequence of moves lead to the same position. Typically, they are board games in which a move involves placement of a piece or a stone on the board. In such games the value of each move is often only slightly influenced by other moves.\n\nIn RAVE, for a given game tree node N, its child nodes Ci store not only the statistics of wins in playouts started in node N but also the statistics of wins in all playouts started in node N and below it, if they contain move i (also when the move was played in the tree, between node N and a playout). This way the contents of tree nodes are influenced not only by moves played immediately in a given position but also by the same moves played later.\n\nWhen using RAVE, the selection step selects the node, for which the modified UCB1 formula ( 1 − β ( n i , n ~ i ) ) w i n i + β ( n i , n ~ i ) w ~ i n ~ i + c ln ⁡ t n i {\\displaystyle (1-\\beta (n_{i},{\\tilde {n}}_{i})){\\frac {w_{i}}{n_{i}}}+\\beta (n_{i},{\\tilde {n}}_{i}){\\frac {{\\tilde {w}}_{i}}{{\\tilde {n}}_{i}}}+c{\\sqrt {\\frac {\\ln t}{n_{i}}}}} has the highest value. In this formula, w ~ i {\\displaystyle {\\tilde {w}}_{i}} and n ~ i {\\displaystyle {\\tilde {n}}_{i}} stand for the number of won playouts containing move i and the number of all playouts containing move i, and the β ( n i , n ~ i ) {\\displaystyle \\beta (n_{i},{\\tilde {n}}_{i})} function should be close to one and to zero for relatively small and relatively big ni and n ~ i {\\displaystyle {\\tilde {n}}_{i}} , respectively. One of many formulas for β ( n i , n ~ i ) {\\displaystyle \\beta (n_{i},{\\tilde {n}}_{i})} , proposed by D.

Learn More.\n\nMonte Carlo simulations are a mathematical technique used across a diverse range of industries and fields to model difficult-to-predict scenarios and outcomes. Despite their name, you don’t have to be a gambler to appreciate their value—in fact, Monte Carlo simulations were designed to take the gamble out of strategic decision-making processes by forecasting a wide range of potential outcomes of uncertain or unforeseen events.\n\nSpreadsheets are well-suited to this kind of data modeling, and learning how to run Monte Carlo simulations in Microsoft Excel or similar software can add a powerful predictive tool to your decision-making toolset. Follow along as I create a Monte Carlo simulation using a normal distribution to generate random variables to learn how to use this valuable technique in your own work.\n\nWhat is a Monte Carlo Simulation?\n\nIn simple terms, a Monte Carlo Simulation is a virtual representation of any statistical procedure that uses randomly generated numbers to solve a problem—more specifically, it generally refers to generating an array of results known as a distribution for any statistical problem that includes a wide range of inputs sampled over and over again.\n\nImagine yourself throwing dice. If you throw them hundreds of thousands or even millions of times, you begin to understand the odds of certain combinations coming up. Monte Carlo Simulations replicate this idea, letting us perform the same kind of statistical analysis quickly and efficiently. By varying the inputs, you can model a wide range of possible outcomes and compare them to help you make decisions in the real world, making this a popular and powerful predictive tool for businesses.\n\nStep 1: Set Up Your Monte Carlo Simulation\n\nLet’s say you’re creating a human resources report about salary levels at other similar companies in your industry. To build this report, you need a fictional but accurate representation of annual salaries per employee at a competing company.\n\nYou have data that suggests the average (mean) annual salary is $40,000, and the standard deviation is $10,000. You want to generate a random salary value based on a normal distribution with the specified mean and standard deviation—each time you recalculate the formula, it should generate a new random salary that follows the given distribution.\n\nThe first step is to set up the simulation in a blank Microsoft Excel sheet as follows:\n\nCreate two columns labeled “Trial Number” and “Normal Random Variable.”\n\nCreate two fields with corresponding labels for “Simulation Mean” and “Simulation Standard Deviation.”\n\nThe mean—often referred to as the arithmetic mean or average—is a statistical measure of central tendency that represents the sum of a set of values divided by the total number of observations in that set.\n\nStandard deviation and average/mean calculations are indispensable for ensuring your simulation conforms to expectations.\n\nStandard Deviation\n\nStandard deviation measures the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values by quantifying the extent to which the individual values in a dataset deviate from the mean.\n\nA low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean.\n\nA high standard deviation suggests that the values are spread out over a wider range.\n\nStandard deviation is calculated by taking the square root of the variance—the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean. When used together, the average/mean and standard deviation provide a more complete picture of the characteristics of a dataset. This allows you to assess the spread of data points and make informed conclusions about the variability and reliability of the dataset under analysis.\n\nNormal/Gaussian Distribution\n\nMonte Carlo simulations generate a series of random observations based on a specific type of statistical distribution. These distributions can be represented as probability curves that determine the likelihood of a particular outcome.\n\nThe Monte Carlo simulation I’m creating for this example uses a normal, or Gaussian, distribution—as a result, you can expect about 68 percent of the data to fall within one standard deviation of the mean, 95 percent within two standard deviations, and approximately 99.7 percent within three standard deviations.\n\nThe normal or Gaussian distribution is perhaps best known for its visual representation as the standard bell-shaped curve; when plotted, this function is characterized by an even distribution on each side, with tails that stretch to infinity on the X-axis.\n\nIn normal distributions, the median and mean values are the same—this leaves zero skew and a symmetrical graph. Normal distributions are appropriate for continuous data that has an equal likelihood of being above or below the mean, and are commonly used for measuring continuous data that hovers around a mean value. For example, instructors typically grade their students’ test scores on a normal distribution curve as a way to ensure fairness.\n\nStep 2: Create Rows for Your Trials or Iterations\n\nIn this example, let’s simulate 100 trials or iterations for a normal random variable with a mean of 40,000 and a standard deviation of 10,000. Here’s how to set that up in the Excel sheet:\n\nIn the “Trial Number” column, insert the first two sequential values (1 and 2) manually in the first two rows below the header.\n\nHighlight the two values—the draggable green edge will appear on the bottom right of the selection.\n\nDrag the green edge down the column to create 100 sequential row values in the “Trial Number” column.\n\nStep 3: Generate Your Random Value Variables\n\nMonte Carlo simulations in Excel rely on two functions in particular: RAND() and NORM.INV. The first, RAND(), introduces variability to simulate randomness by using a built-in formula to generate a random numeric decimal value between 0 and 1. The second, NORM.INV, returns the inverse of the normal cumulative distribution for the specified mean and standard deviation—in this example, 40,000 and 10,000 respectively.\n\nTo generate these values:\n\nInsert the following formula into the first field of your “Normal Random Variable” column:\n\n=NORM.INV(RAND(),40000,10000)\n\nSelect the value and drag the green edge down the column until you have 100 normal random variables for row values.\n\nStep 4: Verify Your Values\n\nIf you take a cursory glance at your resulting values, you’ll notice that they look fairly normal in terms of the distribution—as they should. We can verify this by calculating the mean/average and standard deviation for the entire generated dataset in your Monte Carlo Simulation:\n\nInsert the following formula into the field next to your “Simulation Mean” label to get the mean/average:\n\n=AVERAGE(B2:B101)\n\nBe sure to replace “B2:B101” with the actual data range in your spreadsheet.\n\nInsert the following formula into the field next to your “Standard Deviation” label to get the standard deviation for the data set:\n\n=STDEV(B2:B101)\n\nAgain, be sure to replace “B2:B101” with the actual data range in your spreadsheet.\n\nWIth these steps completed, your Monte Carlo Simulation results should resemble my outputs in the illustration below.\n\nIn comparing the hard-coded, specified average/mean and standard deviation values with the average/mean and standard deviation values generated from the simulated dataset, you’ll see that the values seem to be in line with expectations.\n\nAverage (mean) Standard Deviation Specified 40,000 10,000 Simulation 38504.53 9418.857\n\nStep 5: Visualize Your Monte Carlo Simulation Results\n\nSince we used the NORM.INV function to create your normal random variable values, the plot should resemble a standard bell-curve distribution. You can verify this in Excel by plotting out your results in a histogram;\n\nTo verify that your results conform to the expected normal distribution curvature, select all the values in the “Normal Random Variable” column.\n\nNext, select the “Insert” menu, and click the small arrow to expand the ribbon and show all available chart options.\n\nSelect “All Charts,” and choose Histogram from the list.\n\nThe resulting histogram visually represents the distribution of outcomes, grouped into bins, as in the following image.\n\nAs you can see, your Monte Carlo simulation conforms to a standard distribution—you can trace the lines contours of a bell-shaped curve on the outer edges of the histogram.\n\nRemember, our goal was to create a fictional representation of annual salaries at a company similar to your own in order to generate an HR report about salary levels at competing businesses, and your data suggested an average (mean) annual salary of $40,000 with a standard deviation of $10,000.\n\nUsing the results of our Monte Carlo simulation, you have a scientifically-derived sample dataset of hypothetical competitor salaries to compare against your own.\n\nUsing Other Monte Carlo Simulation Distribution Types in Excel\n\nAlong with normal/Gaussian distributions, Excel provides a number of statistical distribution types to use in Monte Carlo simulations.You can find them under the Formulas menu by selecting “More Functions” and then “Statistical.” There are a few that I find more useful than others, as they represent the more common distribution types.\n\nUniform Distribution\n\nIn a uniform distribution, an equal likelihood exists between the minimum and maximum values. Visually, a uniform distribution looks like a rectangle when plotted out on a graph. Uniform distributions are often used to generate random numbers and in other scenarios that involve events that are equally likely to occur.\n\nLog-Normal Distribution\n\nAs its name implies, a log-normal distribution has a normally distributed logarithm with the mean and standard deviation. Log-normal distributions skew to the right and are ideal for modeling rate descriptions—for example, time to repair, equipment failure rates, and income distributions.\n\nPoisson Distribution\n\nPoisson distributions are ideal for addressing large distributions near the start that quickly dissipate to a long tail on one side. They’re best for predicting the number of events that transpire within a given timeframe—for example, customer purchases per quarter or transactions per day.\n\nLimitations of Monte Carlo Simulations in Excel\n\nExcel can be a useful tool for many Monte Carlo simulations, but the software’s limitations as a desktop or Software as a Service (SaaS) application are worth keeping in mind.\n\nRandom Number Generation\n\nExcel’s built-in random number generator uses a pseudorandom number generator, and the quality of randomness may be a concern in certain use cases. Advanced simulations might require more sophisticated random number generation techniques.\n\nLimited Flexibility for Complex Models\n\nExcel may not be suitable for highly complex models that involve intricate interdependencies, non-linear relationships, or dynamic systems. I suggest using specialized simulation or statistical software or programming languages in these cases.\n\nLimited Support for Advanced Techniques\n\nSome advanced Monte Carlo simulation techniques such as adaptive sampling or advanced variance reduction methods are difficult to implement in Excel without resorting to complex workarounds.\n\nLack of Parallel Processing\n\nUnlike a cloud-based data warehouse or statistical package, Excel is incapable of parallel processing and horizontal scaling. This limits its performance capabilities when carrying out simulations, as it lacks the parallelization mechanisms to speed up computations.\n\nExcel Add-Ins for Working with Data\n\nData simulation—generating synthetic data to closely mimic the properties and characteristics of real-world data—can offer data scientists, engineers, and commercial enterprises access to training data at a fraction of the cost of real world data and open doors to all kinds of predictive modeling, risk assessment, and other benefits.\n\nMonte Carlo simulations are just one example of what’s possible—and while Excel’s wide range of statistical functions is sufficient for them in many cases, it lacks some of the more advanced statistical analysis tools required for in-depth analysis of simulation results. For this, I recommend that you install one of the many third-party and Microsoft-provided statistics add-ons directly from within Excel.\n\nEven with add-ins, however, desktop spreadsheet applications are not designed for heavy computational tasks. As the number of simulations or the complexity of the model increases, computation times can quickly overcome your system. For large-scale simulations, specialized statistics software packages or programming languages may be more efficient for advanced modeling purposes.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\nHow accurate are Monte Carlo simulations?\n\nMonte Carlo simulations estimate numerical results through random sampling, so the accuracy of the Monte Carlo simulation method increases with your sample size. That said, the accuracy level is also influenced by other factors such as the quality of the random number generator—for example, Excel’s random number generator is limited in this regard.\n\nHow many Monte Carlo simulations is enough?\n\nThe ideal sample size for your Monte Carlo simulation depends on various factors, including the desired level of precision and the characteristics of the modeled system/scenario. But you can use more advanced statistical tools to determine your ideal sample size. For example, running a sensitivity analysis will let you determine how changes in sample size impact the stability/reliability of your simulation; this involves running the simulation with different sample sizes and observing the variation in outcomes.\n\nDo Monte Carlo simulations assume a normal distribution?\n\nGenerally speaking, all simulations will assume a normal distribution if your sample size is large enough; however, depending on the specific context/nature of the simulated data, one of the other distribution types may be more appropriate for your use case. Running a sensitivity analysis will allow you to compare how different data distributions affect your outcome.\n\nCan I run a Monte Carlo simulation using software other than Excel?\n\nYes, you can use comparable spreadsheet programs like Google Sheets or Zoho Sheets to run a Monte Carlo simulation. Advanced statistical software packages like IBM SPSS and SAS offer more power and options when running Monte Carlo simulations, at the cost of a steep learning curve.\n\nThe Bottom Line: Running Monte Carlo Simulations in Excel\n\nMonte Carlo simulations are easy-to-use, powerful mechanisms for enterprise decision-making, risk assessment, and forecasting. Despite some limitations, Excel and similar spreadsheet tools remain competent options for carrying out rudimentary Monte Carlo simulations and should prove an indispensable statistical instrument in your analytical toolkit. For more sophisticated applications, I recommend that you consider specialized simulation software packages or programming languages like Python, R, or MATLAB."
