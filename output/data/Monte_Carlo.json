      "# [Delivering End-to-End Data Trust with Snowflake and Monte Carlo by Scott O'Leary on 2021-04-29](https://www.montecarlodata.com/blog-snowflake/)\nAs companies increasingly leverage data-driven insights to drive innovation and maintain their competitive edge, it’s important that this data is accurate and reliable. With Monte Carlo and Snowflake’s strategic partnership, teams can finally trust their data through end-to-end Data Observability and automated lineage of their entire data ecosystem, all the way down to field-level values.\n\nHas your CEO ever told you that the numbers in a report you showed her looked way off?\n\nHas a customer ever called out errors in your product’s dashboards?\n\nWhat about a rise in a field’s null rate that went unnoticed for days or weeks because there wasn’t a noticeable change in your KPIs?\n\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, you’re not alone. Data downtime, in other words, periods of time when data is missing, inaccurate, or otherwise erroneous, is an all-too-familiar reality for even the best data teams, costing them millions of dollars in wasted revenue and up to 50 percent of the data engineering team’s time that could otherwise be spent moving the needle for the business.\n\nTo help companies trust their data, Monte Carlo is excited to announce our partnership with Snowflake by bringing our automated Data Observability Platform to the Data Cloud. Data teams relying on Snowflake to derive critical insights about their business can now leverage the power of automated anomaly detection, monitoring, and end-to-end lineage to prevent bad data from affecting downstream consumers.\n\nAchieving reliable Snowflake pipelines with data observability\n\nThe Snowflake – Monte Carlo integration makes it easy for data organizations to identify, resolve, and prevent data downtime and data quality issues before they impact the business, giving companies confidence in the reliability of their data and the products they power.\n\nWith this partnership, Snowflake customers can now:\n\nAchieve end-to-end Data Observability without writing any code. Get end-to-end data observability for your Snowflake data pipelines with a 20-minute, no-code implementation process. Access out-of-the-box visibility into data Freshness, Volume, Distribution, Schema, and Lineage just by plugging Monte Carlo into your Data Cloud.\n\nKnow when data breaks, as soon as it happens. Monte Carlo continuously monitors your Snowflake assets and proactively alerts stakeholders to data issues. Monte Carlo’s machine learning-first approach gives data teams broad coverage for common data issues with minimal configuration, and business-context-specific checks layered on top ensure you’re covered at each stage of your data pipeline.\n\nFind the root cause of data quality issues, fast. Monte Carlo gives teams a single pane of glass to investigate data issues, drastically reducing time to resolution. By bringing all information and context for your pipelines into one place, teams spend less time firefighting data issues and more time improving the business.\n\nImmediately understand the business impact of bad data. End-to-end lineage for your pipelines from the point it enters Snowflake (or further upstream!) down to the analytics and business intelligence layer, data teams are able to assess the business impact of their data issues, ultimately preventing decision making based on bad data.\n\nPrevent data downtime. Give your teams full visibility into your Snowflake pipelines and how they impact downstream reports and dashboards to make more informed development decisions. With Monte Carlo, teams can better manage breaking changes to ELTs and BI assets by knowing what will be impacted and who to notify.\n\nIn addition to supporting existing mutual customers, Monte Carlo provides end-to-end, automated coverage for teams migrating from their legacy stacks to the Snowflake Data Cloud Platform. Moreover, Monte Carlo’s security-first approach to Data Observability ensures that data never leaves your Snowflake environment.\n\nWhat Monte Carlo and Snowflake customers have to say\n\nThe Zebra\n\nThe Zebra, a leading insurance comparison site, makes it easy for consumers across the United States to compare and save on car and home insurance quotes. The company provides over 1,800 car insurance products from more than 200 national insurers, a monumental feat that relies on real-time decision making powered by data from disparate third-party vendors and partners. The Zebra’s data team uses Snowflake and Monte Carlo to ensure that their data pipelines are performant and reliable.\n\n“As a data leader, there’s nothing worse than not being able to trust your data,” said Shea Spalding, Head of Data Governance at The Zebra. “The combination of Snowflake’s data cloud and Monte Carlo’s data observability platform helps ensure that our data is accessible and fresh at each stage of the data life cycle. With this stack, my team can better collaborate to resolve issues, work towards data trust, and build better products for our customers.”\n\nMindbody\n\nAs the world’s leading wellness services marketplace, Mindbody is a company with data at heart. Alex Soria, VP of Data & Analytics, is leading the charge with a team of over 25 data scientists, business intelligence analysts, and data engineers responsible for ensuring that the insights powering their product is fresh and reliable.\n\nAs the world’s leading wellness services marketplace, Mindbody is a company with data at heart. Alex Soria, VP of Data & Analytics, is leading the charge with a team of over 25 data scientists, business intelligence analysts, and data engineers responsible for ensuring that the insights powering their product is fresh and reliable.\n\n“Data-driven decision making is a huge priority for Mindbody, but our analytics are only as reliable as the data that informs them,” said Alex. “We are working with Monte Carlo to monitor and alert for abnormalities in our Snowflake pipelines, such as null values and duplicate data, that would otherwise go unnoticed until it’s too late. By partnering with Snowflake and Monte Carlo, my team can achieve more powerful analytics and full data reliability.”\n\nCollaborative Imaging\n\nCollaborative Imaging is a radiologist-owned alliance dedicated to improving the lives of physicians and patients everywhere through technology. With over 18,000 patients seen per day and nearly 1M radiological exams read per month, the alliance is charting a course for the future of this industry by giving providers the solutions and processes necessary to better serve their communities.\n\nTo power their business, Collaborative Imaging needs fast analytics powered by clean and reliable data, which is no easy feat given the size and scope of their distributed data ecosystem. To gain greater visibility into the health of their data at each stage of its life cycle, they needed a way to understand how data flows into their data warehouse, as well as be alerted when changes occur in schema or distribution of the many data sources which are ingested into their Snowflake data warehouse. Monte Carlo empowered them to troubleshoot and resolve issues before downstream data consumers are impacted.\n\n“Collaborative Imaging’s analytics platform helps physicians and patients connect the dots between disparate data points in their healthcare journey, but our insights are only as reliable as the data feeding our system. Dirty data is a landmark of healthcare analytics, and a lot of the work we do revolves around cleaning and making sense of this data to put it into one repository,” said Jacob. “Combined with Snowflake’s powerful Data Cloud and Monte Carlo’s Data Observability Platform, we can resolve these problems before they reach the business. My executives are happy and I can trust our data.”\n\nWant to learn more about how data observability can help you trust your data?

I really recommend these lectures. He's a fantastic teacher. This is his current semester, so it's not yet complete. Previous years' courses are also available if you outpace his output. \n\nMC methods are surprisingly powerful for how simple they are, conceptually. Firstly, they can replace the ocean of test statistics that you have to grapple with using frequentist methods. With a single process you can do pretty much any hypothesis test without basing the overall assessment of the hypothesis on an arbitrary cutoff point like alpha=5%.\n\nYou can incorporate domain knowledge in your models. If, for example, you know that a parameter *has* to be positive (because it's a count of some real world thing) and also should probably be somewhere between 5 and 10, and is very unlikely to be 10,000 you can include this in your model even if you don't have any data for it.\n\nMC methods also let you design relationships between variables, let you get information about unobserved quantities that either affect or are affected by observed quantities, can be used as part of a causal analysis, can give you a tool for simulating a contra-positive (what would have happened otherwise), can give you highly explainable results, can work on smaller data sets, can give you not only point estimates but credible intervals (which are much more intuitive to non-technical people than confidence intervals are).\n\n### Comment ID j5ztk8k with +1 score by [(Coco_Dirichlet, Reddit, 2023-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10ljew2/monte_carlo_simulation/j5ztk8k/) (in reply to ID j5yyfh4):\nMCMC is not the same as MC\n\n## Comment ID j5ylvf6 with +3 score by [(OneSprinkles6720, Reddit, 2023-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10ljew2/monte_carlo_simulation/j5ylvf6/) (in reply to ID 10ljew2):\nMonte carlo gives me guidelines I can use to yank a financial markets trading algo out of production.

I frequently use them to come up with valuations of complex instruments like options and earnout payments (a future payment made to the previous owner of an acquired company based on future performance metrics). \n\nFor earnouts specifically, there is no way to determine the actual value since it depends on future performance of the company. A MC simulation helps come up with the most likely value by simulating different levels of future performance and buyout scenarios, which is needed for financial reporting purposes.\n\nFor earnouts, I use a software package called Crystal Ball which has an Excel plugin.

Of course exotic options that have knockouts or whatever don't have closed form solutions and Monty Carlo simulations are really the only way to model payoffs there. It was exactly this use case that really got me to see some of the usefulness and nuances of MC sims. E.g. if you have a meaningful price barrier in the payoff function, the granularity of the simulation effects accuracy (i.e. you won't capture some plausible intraday crossing of said barrier if you simulate hours/days etc).\n\n#### Comment ID j60r8jc with +1 score by [(EMoneymaker99, Reddit, 2023-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10ljew2/monte_carlo_simulation/j60r8jc/) (in reply to ID j60iq5v):\nYeah, for vanilla options I use a BSM but for exotics MC is usually the way to go, like you said. Sometimes a Binomial Lattice model works too, depending on the option.

How do you calculate the uncertainty for those predictions/predicted probabilities? Well, the easiest way to go about it is by doing MC simulation because in non-linear models, the uncertainty for each prediction is going to change for each value of X.\n\nYou can also use Monte Carlo simulations for cross-validation.\n\nYou can also use Monte Carlo simulations when you are comparing a series of different models performance, on average, with a lot of data you simulated (fake data) that has a particular problem (e.g. heteroskedastic data, or serially correlated data).\n\nAnd can people in the comments spot implying MCMC is the same as MC. It's not! MCMC includes an MC, but OP asked about MC. They aren't used for the same problems. If you take a Bayesian Stats course, you'll cover MCMC but MC is just going to be a tiny part of the course.  \n\nThere are several books that are *only* on Monte Carlo simulations. I have several I got for courses I took in grad school. If you want to learn about it, getting an applied book that's specifically about it is useful.\n\nI don't know what people are talking about on Twitter. Twitter is shit. That said, in general courses don't focus a lot on the presentation of results/prediction/visualization/explanation, and MC is used a lot on that area. Books usually stop once you fit the model, maybe have some basic table, a one summary explanation of the results (and it's usually something like this goes up, this goes down), the end.\n\n### Comment ID j61k284 with +1 score by [(MrAce2C, Reddit, 2023-01-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10ljew2/monte_carlo_simulation/j61k284/) (in reply to ID j6001fc):\nHi!

For example, computing the price of a path dependent option using a nontrivial (í.e. something more advanced than black scholes) model for the underlying asset means you are probably looking at an sde which has no known closed form solution for the pdf, so how will you compute the risk neutral expectation of the payoff function (meaning the price of the option)?

That's usually in conjunction with a user story mapping process (Jeff Patton), and harks back to how Extreme Programming (XP) worked.   \n  \nAs soon as access to the customer becomes a constraint, you'll tend to slide towards larger \"batch sizes\" and the need for more \"upstream\" product discovery and \"downstream\" UAT and feedback.  \n  \nIn those cases you tend to move from the \"thin slice of value\" model and decompose the \"big\" work into things that are more work-flow or task oriented, based on the \"up front requirements\"   \n  \nIt's not super agile, because the big batch sizes will still tend to mean an \"inspect and rework\" approach to quality (in a \"built the right thing\" sense)   \n  \nHowever it's also not really waterfall, as you will still be doing all the agile \"build the thing right\" stuff around CI/CD, automated testing, agile test quadrants and even stuff like TDD and pairing.\n\nThat said, I'd counsel it's really down to the team in terms of how they want to self-manage the work.  The data they are tracking should help them to locate bottlenecks and continuously improve how they are delivering.  \n  \nIt's also up to the business how they want to control investment risk.  The bigger the batch size, the greater the sunk-costs, and the more you stand to lose if you are wrong about what customers value.  \n  \nIf you have the access to capital that supports the size of bet you are making, then that's okay.

MC simulation achieved better results.\n* One of the most subtle, but best things about moving to something like MC simulation is the introduction of probability into forecasts. You no longer communicate: \"Yeah, we'll be done on Feb 30. We think.\" and move to \"We'll be finished on Feb 30, x% of the time\" where x is your risk tolerance.\n* A lot of people make a big deal about sample set. I found that 10 pieces of cycle time/throughput data was sufficient to start generating results.\n* While small, same sized stories can help, I found you can still use MC simulation without working on story size. What a backlog with same sized stories will do is \"narrow\" the distribution curve of throughput results, which will reduce the impact of risk levels on the forecast. Forecasts with randomly sized stories are still valid, but changes in risk tolerance will produce a wider range of results.\n* Some semblance of control over cycle time, and thus throughput, is more important than story size, imo. But you really shouldn't be saying you're using kanban if you're not controlling WIP.\n* You'll need to prune your data set. Obvious outliers should be thrown away. You probably want a horizon for the data so you're biased towards more recent results. And, of course, fundamental changes to critical things like team composition, etc can render previous forecasts unreliable.\n\n### Comment ID lkk3skz with +3 score by [(mippzon, Reddit, 2024-08-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/agile/comments/1f4akow/you_experience_with_monte_carlo_simulation_in/lkk3skz/) (in reply to ID lkjzn6p):\nThanks for an extensive answer!

I believe it might be a plugin for Jira now??\n* Even with expert Kanban teams, you might find yourself with a story/ticket that gets put on hold due to some emergency, or because someone is sick and there's no one to pick it up, or life just generally intervenes. For example, a ticket might get started before Christmas, just not get finished before the break, and sit there until the new year. Yeah, with enough brain sweat we could have probably come up with a good enough adjusted cycle time, but we just didn't want to bother. One of the things we wanted from the MC approach was just less handling of stories. \n* I'm not sure what you're asking for in terms of variance. Do you mean what's the farthest we've missed a forecast? Or how much the forecast varies based on risk? \n   * If it's the latter, then yeah, some of our forecasts generated with small data sets had great sensitivity to risk level. That's the one advantage of a larger data set and/or smaller stories. \n   * If it's the former, we tended to set quarterly releases to customers, so we'd use a \"How many\" simulation to tell the PO how many stories they could reasonably pick from the product backlog. We were generally within 10% of the forecasted # of stories while velocity wasn't as accurate (plus velocity generally deals with averages, which is essentially a coin toss). \n\nHope that answers your questions.\n\n### Comment ID lkw06s0 with +1 score by [(AskGroundbreaking124, Reddit, 2024-08-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/agile/comments/1f4akow/you_experience_with_monte_carlo_simulation_in/lkw06s0/) (in reply to ID lkjzn6p):\nNice!\n\nSince you mentioned User Story size, I would be very grateful if you could share your view in a situation I have already shared in other comment.\n\nI have just joined a startup that is all into Kanban, using Monte Carlo and stuff but their Work Item is Tasks (like technical ones, frontend, backend and stuff), they jump from epics right to technical tasks, and then all the metrics and simulations a are applied in this task level.\n\nIs does not make any sense to me.\nI believe the right level to estimate, simulate and get metrics would be User Stories, I am right?\n\nIf so, how do the devs breakdown the user stories and track them in the board?\n\nThanks for any advice!\n\n#### Comment ID lkx1w9j with +1 score by [(DingBat99999, Reddit, 2024-09-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/agile/comments/1f4akow/you_experience_with_monte_carlo_simulation_in/lkx1w9j/) (in reply to ID lkw06s0):\nI guess the first question is: Is it working?

I think you need to frame the method in knowing that a huge part of the practical application of mathematics before the 20th century involved manually computing different functions. \n\nHuge reference works of tables were produced of sines and cosines of different angles and the digits of pi to offload computation time for precise calculations. Some mathematicians spent years creating these kinds of tables. It's been argued that some of Newton's discoveries were the probable result of him seeing patterns in the huge numbers of manual computations that he used to do. Yes, even 'serious' people like Newton did this kind of thing.\n\nConceptually, an abacus is analogous to a computer. It's just offloading computation onto a physical process. Disregarding the technical breakthroughs of the transistor and the miniaturization of electronics, a computer is, conceptually, just finding a way to have calculations be done by the universe, through moving electrons around, rather than doing them by hand on a piece of paper. However, just by doing this very simple thing more quickly you are able to create entirely new fields, like computer graphics, that would be unthinkable in a paradigm where calculations have to be done by hand.\n\nSimilarly, the realization that: \"all of these problems that we can't solve analytically, I think we can solve them numerically by setting up a situation where a device will just 'spit out the correct answer'\" was pretty brilliant. Sure, this idea is somewhat obvious once advanced computers are established as an existing thing, but Ulam invented the method in the infancy of computers. Before computers, this kind of approach would have been unthinkable. If your issue is that \"Ulam shouldn't get so much credit because anyone could have come up with the idea once computers became established\" then maybe you're correct. But disregarding the question of credit and just considering the method itself, doesn't it almost send chills down your spine that we can just set up a system correctly and then have it give us the answer to a question that we would have no way of finding out the answer to on our own?\n\n### Comment ID kppannf with +50 score by [(rhubarb_man, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kppannf/) (in reply to ID kpp8ns6):\nI see, thank you.

With just a bit of computing power you can get a long way without any real understanding of what you're studying.

Some of these stunning applications come in theory CS, particularly in counting or sampling from a set of combinatorial structures. The MCMC method runs riot here.\n\nOne example which I have directly worked on is the uniform sampling of proper colorings of a graph. Note that the set of all colorings, proper and improper, with k colors of a graph with n vertices is exponentially large. What you want to do however is produce a uniform sample from the set of proper colorings, i.e., colorings which impart two different colors across any edge of the graph. This set is exponentially smaller than the set of all colorings, and it is unstructured. So we have absolutely no clue how to produce a uniform sample from this set other than the Monte Carlo method. \n\nAnother interesting example is sampling independent sets of a graph. Note that usually this is a very hard problem. However, using the MCMC method we discovered that there is a range of parameters for which this sampling is easy, and beyond a certain threshold suddenly becomes hard in the NP hard sense. It turns out this threshold is related to the physics of phase transitions of certain models of magnetism! \n\nOther places where deep insights have been gleaned from this technique is the theory of expanders  which finds use in everything from modelling large networks to error correcting codes. \n\nThere are literally reams of literature dedicated to this line of work in theory CS, each more surprising than the last. \n\nI hope this answer helps somewhat.\n\n## Comment ID kpoxxzt with +3 score by [(CatOfGrey, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kpoxxzt/) (in reply to ID 1amy1gh):\nWhat makes Monte Carlo interesting for me, is that it can be used to model outcomes based on non-standard distributions.\n\nIn my practice, I have done Monte Carlo work with survey data.

Sometimes though, it's just not possible, or at least beyond my ability, or just too time consuming to attempt. When those problems arise I can use a Monte Carlo approach, and suddenly I don't have to worry so much about conjugate priors, parameter covariances, correlated variables, etc.\n\nInstead, I just build a model of the physical system I care about (this can be arbitrarily complicated, like a ray trace model of the Hubble Space Telescope), and randomly perturb some parameters and measure some outputs, a million times over.

I have an answer to my question, with the full accuracy of the physical model, without a PhD thesis effort to build a valid analytical model of the whole mess.\n\n## Comment ID kpq9y5r with +2 score by [(archpawn, Reddit, 2024-02-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kpq9y5r/) (in reply to ID 1amy1gh):\n[Relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/2042/)\n\n## Comment ID kpqwryu with +2 score by [(Aurhim, Reddit, 2024-02-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kpqwryu/) (in reply to ID 1amy1gh):\nI like to pretend that its name is the \"Monte Christo\" method, and that it is out for revenge against all the other integration methods that wronged it (Riemann sums, the trapezoid rule, Simpson's rule, etc.).\n\n## Comment ID kpov55d with +2 score by [(RightProfile0, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kpov55d/) (in reply to ID 1amy1gh):\nThe answer is, It's not very interesting but rather essential tools in computing\n\n## Comment ID kpory5m with +1 score by [(Integralcel, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kpory5m/) (in reply to ID 1amy1gh):\nW question\n\n### Comment ID kpoy78v with +8 score by [(WWWWWWVWWWWWWWVWWWWW, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kpoy78v/) (in reply to ID kpory5m):\nW answer:\n\nOP chose the simplest possible case, so of course it feels elementary.

Right now, we know general/Newtonian physics and then things get more hairy from there once our object of study becomes smaller. If we precisely knew, or at least the equations of, every possible chemical reactions down to the most granular level of matter, then we can predict everything in theory. \n\nBut even then just knowing the equation does not give the formula for the solutions, let alone existence directly. All the deterministic methods we have, i.e., numerical methods, usually require us to know enough about the equation to make reasonable approximations. However, when we do not even know the equations and all we have is just observations, then the Monte Carlo methods can help us. \n\nIt's not clear from the simple coin toss example but it's evident when you learn just a little bit of Reinforcement Learning. The big breakthrough that RL brought us in the field of AI stuff like beating Chess, Go, Starcraft, Dota, or Protein folding, self-driving cars are all founded on that simple idea of *repeatedly sampling from your environment* until you learn enough. Note that I am entirely discarding more traditional areas like numerical integration, but that's not to mean MC was not helpful there. \n\nIt's a bit simplistic but if we take the existence or invention of computers granted, then we owe much of modern scientific advances on modern AI to that silly little idea of \"flipping a coin bunch of times.\"\n\n## Comment ID kpr8q61 with +1 score by [(512165381, Reddit, 2024-02-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kpr8q61/) (in reply to ID 1amy1gh):\nApplications\n\n- it can be used in calculus https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_integration\n\n- it IS used in quantitative finance https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_methods_in_finance\n\n- it IS used in pricing financial options https://blog.skz.dev/monte-carlo-options-pricing\n\n> Have people not been doing it for millennia?\n\nProbably, but now we do it via computer.\n\n## Comment ID kprbudd with +1 score by [(gutshog, Reddit, 2024-02-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kprbudd/) (in reply to ID 1amy1gh):\nthis math not mathmemes\n\n## Comment ID kprkejh with +1 score by [(tpn86, Reddit, 2024-02-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kprkejh/) (in reply to ID 1amy1gh):\nThe price of a financial asset is an expectation.

Isn't it an utterly trivial observation? Why is it named after Dirichlet? Surely people know about it before? Well, it's not named after him before he's the first one to discover it; it's named after him because he's the first one to use it in an interesting way to solve a difficult problem: proving Dirichlet's unit theorem. Sure, once phrased in the right context, the method become obvious, but what's not obvious is using it in that particular case.\n\nSame here. The interesting thing here is that Ulam is using it to solve the problem of estimating an integral, which was not obvious before. Of course, the method in generality must have been used before, but it's not an obvious idea to apply it in this scenario. As far as I know, there are no records of ancient people using dart throw to estimate the area of a geometric object.",

If a) annual recurring revenue hits $1,000,000 the next, and b) expenses are less than $600,000, then a payment of $500,000 is made. The payment itself is the formula running through the 10,000 iterations; however, it isn't as simple as \"if annual recurring revenue minus expenses is greater than $400,000, then the payment is $500,000.\" \n\nFirst, annual recurring revenue is a \"point in time\" figure of what will be expected going forward based on contracts in place today whereas expenses reflect actual historical operations. Second, and more important, if either metric is not achieved, no payment is made. Annual recurring revenue could be $1,300,000 and expenses could be $800,000, for example, which would mean no payment is due even though the difference between the two metrics is beyond the target difference.\n\nI modeled out the payout scenarios fine, but when I get to actually running a metric through Geometric Brownian Motion, I realize there is no one metric to run through. I referenced the [VFR Valuation Advisory #4 Valuation of Contingent Consideration](https://appraisalfoundation.sharefile.com/share/view/s89a36f672e344eeb) guidance, but it does not quantify an example provided regarding revenue and EBITDA hurdles being achieved (on page 17). \n\nHas anyone had any luck running this type of modeling? \n\n## Comment ID kilv7gd with +4 score by [(TheHuskyFluff, Reddit, 2024-01-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialmodelling/comments/19altie/monte_carlo_with_two_separate_forecast_metrics/kilv7gd/) (in reply to ID 19altie):\nWhy not an AND formula for both conditions?

This is going to require an assumption of fixed vs. variable costs. So my path forward would be to model the variable costs in line with the revenue simulation and assume that the fixed costs are well, fixed. The assumption within fixed costs is effectively that they’d be discounted at the risk-free rate or cost of debt, and wouldn’t be subject to a fixed cost volatility that you’d see in a revenue or EBITDA metric for example.\n\nI also think that once you determine the balance of fixed costs vs. variable costs, this may simplify to the use of digital options instead of an MCS. For example, the maximum revenue that would earn the payment without going over would be = ($600,000 – Fixed Costs) ÷ Variable Costs as a % of Revenue. To use proxy numbers, if fixed costs were $250k and variable costs were 30% of revenue, then $1.167m in revenue would yield $600k in expenses, and anymore revenue would yield zero payment. So there is zero payment with revenue below $1m, a payment of $500k if revenue hits $1m, and a reduction in the payment of $500k if revenue hits $1.167m in revenue. I think you could use an MCS to check, but a digital option on a risk neutral revenue metric with a payment at $500k at $1m in revenue and -$500k (clawback)at $1.167m in that case should do the trick or get close.\n\n### Comment ID kirzav3 with +1 score by [(AccountingOnYa, Reddit, 2024-01-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialmodelling/comments/19altie/monte_carlo_with_two_separate_forecast_metrics/kirzav3/) (in reply to ID kio4i7m):\nThanks for the response!

So while it is a startup, there's a healthy balance if you have kids yourself (and they are so accommodating for those with kids!)\n\nOn the tech side, lots of up-to-date tooling working with modern stuff.

Monte Carlo focuses on what matters rather than what they think should matter based on some YC blog they read.\n2. Monte Carlo actually has a natural work-life balance because 1) they can avoid burnout this way and 2) most folks have kids at home. This means no Sunday 11pm emails, no calls scheduled after 6pm, etc. \n3. Monte Carlo is obsessed with solving a HUGE problem with a monumental TAM (Snowflake-sized) because anyone that uses a cloud-based data warehouse has a problem trusting their data. \n\nAs a result, Monte Carlo can provide best-in-class benefits (because we've raised a lot of VC from best-in-class investors), hire the best people, and work with the most data-first companies in the ecosystem. Creating and owning a new category that other companies like Datadog (market cap of $35B) and Snowflake (market cap of $80B) will eventually step into is also very satisfying. \n\nFinally, having a woman as CEO that is not some 25 year old wunderkid out of Stanford/MIT/Harvard means diversity, equity, and inclusion starts at the top. We can recruit some of the best talent (1:1 female to male ratio currently) because our culture is actually inclusive and not full of 26 year old white guys from SoMa/The Marina.",

Monte Carlo focuses on what matters rather than what they think should matter based on some YC blog they read.\n2. Monte Carlo actually has a natural work-life balance because 1) they can avoid burnout this way and 2) most folks have kids at home. This means no Sunday 11pm emails, no calls scheduled after 6pm, etc. \n3. Monte Carlo is obsessed with solving a HUGE problem with a monumental TAM (Snowflake-sized) because anyone that uses a cloud-based data warehouse has a problem trusting their data. \n\nAs a result, Monte Carlo can provide best-in-class benefits (because we've raised a lot of VC from best-in-class investors), hire the best people, and work with the most data-first companies in the ecosystem. Creating and owning a new category that other companies like Datadog (market cap of $35B) and Snowflake (market cap of $80B) will eventually step into is also very satisfying. \n\nFinally, having a woman as CEO that is not some 25 year old wunderkid out of Stanford/MIT/Harvard means diversity, equity, and inclusion starts at the top. We can recruit some of the best talent (1:1 female to male ratio currently) because our culture is actually inclusive and not full of 26 year old white guys from SoMa/The Marina.",

      "# [What Is Data Observability? 5 Key Pillars To Know In 2024 by Barr Moses, Barr Moses CEO, Co-founder, action movies on 2024-03-01](https://www.montecarlodata.com/blog-what-is-data-observability/)\nEditor’s Note: So much has happened since we first published this post and created the data observability category and Monte Carlo in 2019. We have updated this post to reflect this rapidly maturing space. You can read the original article linked at the bottom of this page.\n\nWhat is Data Observability?\n\nI coined the term data observability in 2019. Here is how I define it today:\n\nData observability provides full visibility into the health of your data AND data systems so you are the first to know when the data is wrong, what broke, and how to fix it.\n\nThe solutions in this category feature machine learning anomaly detection, accelerated root cause analysis capabilities, and end-to-end data lineage. This approach results in healthier data pipelines, increased team productivity, enhanced data management practices, and ultimately, higher customer satisfaction.\n\nThe five pillars of data observability are:\n\nFreshness\n\nQuality\n\nVolume\n\nSchema\n\nLineage\n\nTogether, these components provide valuable insight into the quality and reliability of your data.\n\nIn this post, I’ll dive into these concepts in more detail, including what data observability is, what data observability isn’t, who it’s for, and how to choose the right data observability solution for your platform.\n\nLet’s jump in.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe origins of data observability\n\nI started thinking about the concept that I would later label “data observability” when I was serving as the former VP of Customer Success Operations at Gainsight.\n\nTime and again, we’d deliver a report, only to be notified minutes later about issues with our data. It didn’t matter how strong our ETL pipelines were or how many times we reviewed our SQL: our data just wasn’t reliable.\n\nUnfortunately, this problem wasn’t unique. After speaking with hundreds of data leaders about their biggest pain points, I learned that data downtime tops the list.\n\nData downtime — periods of time when data is partial, erroneous, missing, or otherwise inaccurate — only multiplies as data systems become increasingly complex, supporting an endless ecosystem of sources and consumers.\n\nMuch in the same way DevOps applies observability to software, I thought it was time data teams leveraged this same blanket of diligence and began creating the category of data observability as a more holistic way to approach data quality.\n\nAnd along with defining the category, I defined 5 key pillars that define data observability to this day.\n\nWhat are the five pillars of data observability?\n\n“Observability” is a concept many data leaders are probably familiar with from DevOps, but when it comes to data, what is it that we’re actually observing?\n\nNow, let’s take a look at each of these five pillars in a bit more detail.\n\nFreshness\n\nFreshness seeks to understand how up-to-date your data tables are, as well as the cadence at which your tables are updated. Freshness is particularly important when it comes to decision making; after all, stale data is basically synonymous with wasted time and money.\n\nQuality\n\nYour data pipelines might be in working order but the data flowing through them could be garbage. The quality pillar looks at the data itself and aspects such as percent NULLS, percent uniques and if your data is within an accepted range. Quality gives you insight into whether or not your tables can be trusted based on what can be expected from your data.\n\nVolume\n\nVolume refers to the completeness of your data tables and offers insights on the health of your data sources. If 200 million rows suddenly turns into 5 million, you should know.\n\nSchema\n\nChanges in the organization of your data, in other words, schema, often indicates broken data. Monitoring who makes changes to these tables and when is foundational to understanding the health of your data ecosystem.\n\nLineage\n\nWhen data breaks, the first question is always “where?” Data lineage provides the answer by telling you which upstream sources and downstream ingestors were impacted, as well as which teams are generating the data and who is accessing it. Good lineage also collects information about the data (also referred to as metadata) that speaks to governance, business, and technical guidelines associated with specific data tables, serving as a single source of truth for all consumers.\n\nWhy is data observability important?\n\nData observability is important for two reasons. For data engineers (and developers), data observability is important because data downtime means wasted time and resources; for data consumers, it’s equally as important because it erodes confidence in decision making.\n\nIn that sense, the value of data pipeline monitoring and data observability is near priceless. That being said, it’s unlikely the chief financial officer is going to accept “priceless” when you are building your business case. So let’s take a look at how data teams have measured data quality.\n\nA simple calculation for the estimated number of incidents you have each year (whether you are currently catching them or not) can be done by dividing the number of tables you have in your environment by 15.\n\nYou can then multiply this number by your average time-to-detection and average time-to-resolution. If you aren’t currently capturing these metrics, don’t worry, you are not alone.\n\nOur industry research revealed the industry average is about 4 hours and 9 hours respectively–feel free to use or adjust those estimates based on your organization’s data quality maturity.\n\nCongratulations, you have just calculated your data downtime! Now let’s calculate its cost, and thus the value of a data observability solution.\n\nThe first part of the calculation, labor cost, is relatively straightforward. Since we know data quality professionals spend around 40% of their time on inefficient data quality practices, we can use this formula:\n\nTotal data engineers x 1804 (average working hours in a year) x $62 (average salary) x .4\n\nThe operational cost of poor data quality is a bit harder to quantify. A data incident can be as harmless as a broken dashboard no one uses or as painful as reporting incorrect numbers to Wall Street.\n\nOne way to estimate this is to measure the overall risk. If an organization invests in its data team to increase overall efficiency 10% (or insert your own value here) then for each hour of data downtime we can assume the organization’s productivity has been reduced 10%. The formula is then:\n\nOverall data downtime x % reduction in hourly revenue generated.\n\nWe put together a data observability value calculator to help.\n\nData observability is as essential to DataOps as observability is to DevOps\n\nAs organizations grow and the underlying tech stacks powering them become more complicated (think: moving from a monolith to a microservices architecture), it became important for DevOps teams within the software engineering department to maintain a constant pulse on the health of their systems and deploy continuous integration and development (CI/CD) approaches.\n\nObservability, a more recent addition to the software engineering lexicon, speaks to this need, and refers to the monitoring, tracking, and triaging of incidents to prevent software application downtime.\n\nAt its core, there are three pillars of observability data :\n\nMetrics refer to a numeric representation of data measured over time.\n\nLogs, a record of an event that took place at a given timestamp, also provide valuable context regarding when a specific event occurred.\n\nTraces represent causally related events in a distributed environment.\n\n(For a more detailed description of these, I highly recommend reading Cindy Sridharan’s landmark post, Monitoring and Observability).\n\nTaken together, these three pillars and application management (APM) solutions like DataDog or Splunk, gave DevOps teams and software engineers valuable awareness and insights to predict future behavior, and in turn, trust their IT systems to meet SLAs.\n\nData engineering teams needed similar processes and tools to monitor their ETL (or ELT) pipelines and prevent data downtime across their data systems. Enter data observability.\n\nFor data engineers and developers, data observability is important because data downtime means wasted time and resources; for data consumers, it erodes confidence in your decision making.\n\nEvaluation criteria can be tricky when you may not even have a strong answer to the basic question, “what are data observability tools?” You can see what analysts have used as data observability criteria as well a a sample RFP, but in short a great data observability platform has the following features:\n\nIt connects to your existing stack quickly and seamlessly and does not require modifying your data pipelines, writing new code, or using a particular programming language. This allows quick time to value and maximum testing coverage without having to make substantial investments.\n\nIt monitors your data at-rest and does not require extracting the data from where it is currently stored. This allows the data observability solution to be performant, scalable and cost-efficient. It also ensures that you meet the highest levels of security and compliance requirements.\n\nIt requires minimal configuration and practically no threshold-setting. Data observability tools should use machine learning models to automatically learn your environment and your data. It uses anomaly detection techniques to let you know when things break. It minimizes false positives by taking into account not just individual metrics, but a holistic view of your data and the potential impact from any particular issue. You do not need to spend resources configuring and maintaining noisy rules within your data observability platform.\n\nIt requires no prior mapping of what needs to be monitored and in what way. It helps you identify key resources, key dependencies and key invariants so that you get broad data observability with little effort.\n\nIt provides rich context that enables rapid triage and troubleshooting, and effective communication with stakeholders impacted by data reliability issues. Data observability tools shouldn’t stop at “field X in table Y has values lower than Z today.”\n\nIt prevents issues from happening in the first place by exposing rich information about data assets so that changes and modifications can be made responsibly and proactively.\n\nData observability vs. data testing\n\nSimilar to how software engineers use unit tests to identify buggy code before it’s pushed to production, data engineers often leverage tests to detect and prevent potential data quality issues from moving further downstream.\n\nThis approach was (mostly) fine until companies began ingesting so much data that a single point of failure just wasn’t feasible.\n\nI’ve encountered countless data teams that suffer consistent data quality issues despite a rigorous testing regime. It’s deflating and a bad use of your engineers’ time.\n\nThe reason even the best testing processes are insufficient is because there are two types of data quality issues: those you can predict (known unknowns) and those you can’t (unknown unknowns).\n\nSome teams will have hundreds(!) of tests in place to cover most known unknowns but they don’t have an effective way to cover unknown unknowns.\n\nSome examples of unknown unknowns covered by data observability include:\n\nA Looker dashboard or report that is not updating, and the stale data goes unnoticed for several months—until a business executive goes to access it for the end of the quarter and notices the data is wrong.\n\nA small change to your organization’s codebase that causes an API to stop collecting data that powers a critical field in your Tableau dashboard.\n\nAn accidental change to your JSON schema that turns 50,000 rows into 500,000 overnight.\n\nAn unintended change happens to your ETL, ELT or reverse ETL that causes some tests not to run, leading to data quality issues that go unnoticed for a few days.\n\nA test that has been a part of your pipelines for years but has not been updated recently to reflect the current business logic.\n\nIn a Medium article, Vimeo Senior Data Engineer Gilboa Reif describes how using data observability and dimension monitors at scale help address the unknown unknowns gap that open source and transformation tools leave open.\n\nChoozle CTO Adam Woods says data observability gives his team a deeper insight than manual testing or monitoring could provide.\n\nTo summarize, data observability is different and more effective than testing because it provides end-to-end coverage, is scalable, and has lineage that helps with impact analysis.\n\nData observability vs. data monitoring\n\nData pipeline monitoring involves using machine learning to understand the way your data pipelines typically behave, and then send alerts when anomalies occur in that behavior (see the 5 pillars).\n\nSome tools within the modern data stack, like Airflow for instance, will have the ability to monitor their portion of the ETL pipeline. While helpful, data teams need to monitor their entire pipeline end-to-end from ingestion to landing and through transformation all the way to consumption in the BI layer.\n\nIt is also important that data pipeline monitoring is supplemented with a process for monitoring the data quality itself. This is because while the pipeline may be operating fine, the data flowing through it may be garbage.\n\nFor example, the data values may be outside the normal historical range or there could be anomalies present in the NULL rates or percent uniques. Monitoring the data itself can be done automatically with machine learning as well as by setting custom rules, for example if you know a monetary conversion rate can never be negative.\n\nWhen automated data monitoring is combined with features to accelerate incident resolution, understand the impact of those incidents, and illustrate data health over time, it then becomes data observability.\n\nData observability vs data quality\n\nData observability enables and improves data quality. Data quality is often expressed in the six dimensions of accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, validity, and uniqueness.\n\nI’ve found that among business stakeholders, the reality is data quality is considered a binary metric. Your CFO doesn’t come up to you and say, “the data was accurate but out of date so I’m considering it to be of average quality.”\n\nThose other data quality metrics are helpful for data professionals to understand what’s not working and where to focus their resources, but for your data consumers either the data quality is good or it’s bad. Just like a SaaS solution, either it’s working or it’s not. That’s why we created the metric of data downtime.\n\nWith a data observability solution in place, data teams can ensure they have high data quality.\n\nData quality vs data reliability\n\nThese terms are often used interchangeably, which is fine. However, another way to think about it is that solving for data quality requires you to think beyond a point in time, and consider how the quality changes over time in a variety of real-world conditions.\n\nThat is true data reliability.\n\nFor example, the quality of an airline might be measured based on its timeliness (percent of flights on-time), safety (major incidents) and food service approximating that of a diner.\n\nBut in order for the airline to be reliable, it’s expected to maintain those levels of quality consistently over time, across various routes, weather conditions and holiday weekends.\n\nSimilarly, a data product’s quality might be assessed by its availability at 9am, the completeness of records, and its consistency versus a source-of-record. For it to be reliable, you must assess whether it maintains these service levels over time, across holiday traffic spikes and product launches.\n\nIn solving for reliability you must not simply measure data quality (at a point in time and space), but also establish expected levels of quality and service (i.e. how quickly you’ll communicate and respond to incidents), and have the toolkit to rapidly diagnose and resolve data incidents.\n\nData observability vs data reliability engineering\n\nSome data observability companies have started to describe themselves or their tools in the framework of data reliability engineering.\n\nThis makes sense as data observability borrows heavily from observability and other concepts of site reliability engineering (SRE). While different solutions or tools may have significant differences in features offered, there is no real difference between data observability and data reliability engineering.\n\nBoth terms are focused on the practice of ensuring healthy, high quality data across an organization.\n\nSigns you need a data observability platform\n\nThis 2019 talk helped introduced data downtime and data observability. It is still relevant today.\n\nFrom speaking with hundreds of customers over the years, I have identified seven telltale signs that suggest your data team should prioritize data quality.\n\nThey are:\n\nYou’re data platform has recently migrated to cloud\n\nYour data stack is scaling with more data sources, more tables, and more complexity\n\nYour data team is growing\n\nYour team is spending at least 30% of their time firefighting data quality issues\n\nYour team has more data consumers than you did 1 year ago\n\nYour company is moving to a self-service analytics model\n\nData is a key part of the customer value proposition\n\nThe future of data observability\n\nData observability is a rapidly maturing but still evolving space. For example, G2 Crowd created a data observability category in late 2022, but as of this writing there is not a data observability Gartner Magic Quadrant. That being said, Gartner did place data observability on their 2022 Data Management Hype Cycle.\n\nHowever, multiple companies and technologies are identifying with the term data observability. There has been tremendous investor activity, and, most importantly, customer interest and values are at all-time highs.\n\nData observability is at the heart of the modern data stack, whether it’s enabling more self-service analytics and data team collaboration, adoption, or working alongside dbt unit tests and Airflow circuit breakers to prevent bad data from entering the data warehouse (or data lake) in the first place. It is also a core component of important and emerging data quality best practices such as data mesh, data SLAs, and data contracts.\n\nI see a bright future for data observability as data continues its march from dusty dashboards to the boardroom, machine learning models, operational systems, customer facing products, and more.\n\nWith data observability, data quality and data engineering are finally getting a seat at the table.\n\n[The original article that launched a category: What is data observability?

      "# [The Ultimate Guide To Data Lineage by Glen Willis on 2024-07-08](https://www.montecarlodata.com/blog-data-lineage/)\nData lineage is a metadata map that traces the relationship between upstream and downstream dependencies in your data pipelines to illustrate where your data comes from, how it changes, and where it’s surfaced to end users.\n\nLet’s take a look at what enterprise data lineage is in practice and how it supports your data quality.\n\nWhat is Data Lineage?\n\nIn layman’s terms, data lineage is all about mapping: where your data comes from, how it changes as it moves throughout your pipelines, and where it’s surfaced to your end consumers. When done right, data lineage can be a super power for your data engineering teams.\n\nSometimes confused with data mapping, which is the process of combing data fields across models, data lineage instead provides a visualization of how the data moves within an environment.\n\nEnterprise data lineage solutions help data teams:\n\nUnderstand how changes to specific assets will impact downstream dependencies, so they don’t have to work blindly and risk unwelcome surprises for unknown stakeholders.\n\nTroubleshoot the root cause of data issues faster when they do occur by making it easy to see at-a-glance what upstream errors may have caused a report to break.\n\nCommunicate the impact of broken data to consumers who rely on downstream reports and tables—proactively keeping them in the loop when data may be inaccurate and notifying them when any issues have been resolved.\n\nThe data lineage life cycle shows at-a-glance how data is collected and activated to help data teams understand and monitor upstream and downstream dependencies. While data lineage isn’t new to the modern data stack, in the old days (say the mid-2010s or so), enterprise lineage was still an aggressively manual process.\n\nProducing data lineage required identifying your data assets, tracking those assets from ingestion sources, documenting all those sources, mapping the path of data as it moved through various pipelines and transforms, and finally pinpointing where the data was being served up in dashboards and reports.\n\nIn its manual form, lineage was a burden at the best of times. But as data stacks grew more complex, lineage maps became nearly impossible to maintain. These days, thanks to the introduction of automated column level data lineage tooling, mapping dependencies across pipelines has become accessible for the first time.\n\nWhat are the two types of data lineage?\n\nData lineage comes in two primary forms; table-level lineage and column-level lineage (also known as field-level lineage).\n\nTable-level lineage is the simplest and most common form of data lineage, and it illustrates how various tables within a data environment relate to one another. While this can be helpful to understand how a given table has been formed, it can’t tell you about about the origin of the data within the table.\n\nColumn-level data lineage on the other hand is a map of a dataset’s path from ingestion to visualization. Column-level lineage is an essential component of Data Observability because it empowers data engineers to quickly trace the root cause of a data quality incident back to its source and conduct impact analysis to discover what downstream dependencies might be affected.\n\nWhat’s the difference between data lineage and traceability?\n\nWhile both data lineage and traceability are concerned with tracing the origins of data, these two practices differ in their overall purpose and audience.\n\nData lineage, which tends to be very technical is concerned primarily with supporting pipeline optimization and root-cause analysis through a detailed map of how data is ingested, transformed, and activated across a data environment. Traceability, on the other hand, tends to serve the specific needs of a given business domain, and it primarily concerned with validating the origins and accuracy of information for compliance and usage insights.\n\nWhile traceability can be leveraged by any team depending on it’s needs, data lineage is often only useful for technical users like data product managers and platform engineers.\n\nWhy is Data Lineage Important?\n\nData lineage is the key to efficient incident resolution. By understanding the upstream and downstream dependencies of our tables, we can more quickly understand the impact, notify stakeholders, and remediate data data breaks should an incident arise.\n\nMachine learning has enabled vendors to offer data lineage at scale in a way that was previously impossible through manual processes. And that’s a good thing.\n\nBut just because something is easier doesn’t mean it’s always better.\n\nEven with a proliferation of new tooling, if data lineage isn’t handled carefully, it’s unlikely to be much more than eye candy. And unfortunately, some new approaches to data lineage focus more on attractive graphs than compiling a rich, useful map.\n\nUnlike the end-to-end lineage achieved through data observability, these surface-level approaches don’t provide the robust functionality and comprehensive, field-level coverage required to deliver on the value promise of data lineage.\n\nIs data lineage necessary for every data team?\n\nThe short answer is yes. If you are a data team who plans to take data reliability seriously and scale your data quality practice, data lineage is an essential tool in your data quality tool belt.\n\nWhile some data teams with relatively small environments can survive by manually parsing data whenever a data anomaly gets flagged, that will only work for as long as that data remains small. Manually tracing the lineage of 5 tables with 7 data sources isn’t the same as manually tracing the lineage of 100 tables across 50 data sources for assets that are being consumed by 5 different domain teams.\n\nEnterprise data lineage enables teams to scale data quality, and provides enterprise data teams with the resources they need to effectively resolve data quality incidents and reduce the impact of data downtime. Data lineage can also communicate the impact radius of a given data quality incident, so you understand what data assets have been effected, who’s using them, and what to keep an eye on as you begin the incident manage process.\n\nWithout data lineage, growing data teams are fighting data quality fires with their hands behind their backs.\n\nLet’s explore five things your data team can do today to get more value from your data lineage—and where modern data lineage gets it wrong.\n\n5 Ways to Get More Value From Data Lineage\n\n1. Focus on quality over quantity through lineage\n\nModern companies are hungry to become data-driven, but collecting more data isn’t always what’s best for the business. Data that isn’t relevant or useful for analytics can just become noise. Amassing the biggest troves of data doesn’t automatically translate to more value—but it does guarantee higher storage and maintenance costs.\n\nThat’s why big data is getting smaller. Gartner predicts that 70% of organizations will shift their focus from big data to small and wide data over the next few years, adopting an approach that reduces dependencies while facilitating more powerful analytics and AI.\n\nLineage should play a key role in these decisions. Rather than simply using automation to capture and produce surface-level graphs of data, lineage solutions should include pertinent information such as which assets are being used and by whom. With this fuller picture of data usage, teams can begin to get a better understanding of what data is most valuable to their organization. Outdated tables or assets that are no longer being used can be deprecated to avoid potential issues and confusion downstream, and help the business focus on data quality over quantity.\n\n2. Surface what matters through field-level data lineage\n\nPetr Janda recently published an article about how data teams need to treat lineage more like maps—specifically, like Google Maps. He argues that lineage solutions should be able to facilitate a query to find what you’re looking for, rather than relying on complex visuals that are difficult to navigate through.\n\nFor example, you should be able to look for a grocery store when you need a grocery store, without your view being cluttered by the surrounding coffee shops and gas stations that you don’t actually care about. “In today’s tools, data lineage potential is untapped,” Petr writes. “Except for a few filters, the lineage experiences are not designed to find things; they are designed to show things. That’s a big difference.”\n\nWe couldn’t agree more. Data teams don’t need to see everything about their data—they need to be able to find what matters to solve a problem or answer a question.\n\nThis is why field-level lineage is essential. While table-level lineage has been the norm for several years, when data engineers want to understand exactly why or how their pipelines break, they need more granularity. Field-level lineage helps teams zero in on the impact of specific code, operational, and data changes on downstream fields and reports.\n\nWhen data breaks, field-level lineage can surface the most critical and widely used downstream reports that are impacted. And that same lineage reduces time-to-resolution by allowing data teams to quickly trace back to the root cause of data issues.\n\n3. Organize data lineage for clearer interpretation\n\nData lineage can follow in the footsteps of Google Maps in another way: by making it easy and clear to interpret the structure and symbols used in lineage.\n\nJust as Google Maps uses consistent icons and colors to indicate types of businesses (like gas stations and grocery stores), data lineage solutions should apply clear naming conventions and colors for the data it’s describing, down to the logos used for the different tools that make up our data pipelines.\n\nAs data systems grow increasingly complex, organizing lineage for clear interpretation will help teams get the most value out of their lineage as quickly as possible.\n\n4. Include the right context in data lineage\n\nWhile amassing more data for data’s sake may not help meet your business needs, collecting and organizing more metadata—with the right business context—is probably a good idea. Data lineage that includes rich, contextual metadata is incredibly useful because it helps teams troubleshoot faster and understand how potential schema changes will affect downstream reports and stakeholders.\n\nWith the right metadata for a given data asset included in the lineage itself, you can get the answers you need to make informed decisions:\n\nWho owns this data asset?\n\nWhere does this asset live?\n\nWhat data does it contain?\n\nIs it relevant and important to stakeholders?\n\nWho is relying on this asset when I’m making a change to it?\n\nWhen this kind of contextual information about how data assets are used within your business is surfaced and searchable through robust data lineage, incident management becomes easier. You can resolve data downtime faster, and communicate the status of impacted data assets to the relevant stakeholders in your organization.\n\n5. Scale data lineage to meet the needs of the business\n\nUltimately, enterprise data lineage has to be rich, useful, and scaleable in order to be valuable. Otherwise, it’s just eye candy that looks nice in executive presentations but doesn’t do much to actually help teams prevent data incidents or resolve them faster when they do occur.\n\nWe mentioned earlier that lineage has become the hot new layer in the data stack because of automation. And it’s true that automation solves half of this problem: it can help lineage scale to accommodate new data sources, new pipelines, and more complex transformations.\n\nThe other half? Making lineage useful by integrating metadata about all your data assets and pipelines in one cohesive view.\n\nAgain, consider maps. A map isn’t useful if it only shows a portion of what exists in the real world. Without comprehensive coverage, you can’t rely on a map to find everything you need or to navigate from point A to point B. The same is true for data lineage.\n\nEnterprise data lineage solutions must scale through automation without skimping on coverage. Every ingestor, every pipeline, every layer of the stack, and every report must be accounted for, down to the field level—while being rich and discoverable so teams can find exactly what they’re looking for, with a clear organization that makes information easy to interpret, and the right contextual metadata to help teams make swift decisions.\n\nLike we said: lineage is challenging. But when done right, it’s also incredibly powerful.\n\nIf you’re just getting started with data lineage, you might be curious what open-source data lineage tools are available. Unsurprisingly, open source tooling is a go-to for many budget-conscious teams. While this approach certainly has its drawbacks (which we’ll get to in a minute), there are definitely a few open source tools that might be up to the challenge—at least for a little while.\n\nSome of the top open source data data lineage tools include:\n\nOpenMetadata: OpenMetadata is an accessible lineage solution that’s designed to enable coding-limited users to easily create a lineage map without sacrificing the granularity data professionals need to understand complex data transformations.\n\nOpen Lineage + Marquez: OpenLineage isn’t technically a tool, but it’s an open standard for metadata and data lineage collection that recommends the open-source tool Marquez to collect, aggregate and visualize metadata for lineage. Marquez itself offers a relatively user-friendly UI that’s easy to understand and provides a robust API that can be integrated with a variety of data sources and tools to help automate key tasks like backfills and root cause analysis.\n\nEgeria: This one also isn’t a tool, but it provides open APIs, event formats, types, and integration logic to enable metadata features that make it useful for managing data lineage.\n\nApache Atlas: While it bills itself as an open-source metadata management and governance tool, Apache Atlas can be used to track and manage data lineage. Atlas’ UI allows you to view the lineage of data as it moves through various processes and there is a set of REST APIs that allow you to access and update data lineage information.\n\nSpline: An Apache Spark project that was expanded to accommodate data lineage for other data sources. Spline offers APIs to both collect and query data lineage data. Spline supports an OpenLineage integration and it also provides a web UI to display stored lineage information and view lineage in different levels of detail.\n\nJust keep in mind that while there are several options available in the realm of open-source data lineage tools, implementation can definitely be a challenge. An open-source solution might be a good compromise to get you started on a budget, but you’re likely to run into some pretty severe bottlenecks as your needs—and your platform—continues to grow.\n\nWhen that time comes, you’ll probably be better off looking at something like a data observability solution that programmatically marries lineage and monitoring to better support the detection, resolution, and prevention of your data quality issues in a more holistic way.\n\nBottom line: if enterprise data lineage isn’t useful, it doesn’t matter\n\nEven though it seems like data lineage is everywhere right now, keep in mind that we’re also in the early days of automated data lineage. Data lineage tools--whether Collibra, Informatica, Amundsen, Octopai, Monte Carlo, or others--will continue to be refined and improved, and as long as you’re armed with the knowledge of what high-quality lineage should look like, it will be exciting to see where the industry is headed.\n\nOur hope? The category will become less about attractive data lineage graphs and more about powerful functionality, like the next Google Maps.\n\nWant to see the power of data lineage in action?

      "# [Snowflake Summit 2024 Keynote Recap: The Era of Enterprise AI by Michael Segner, data quality, data teams on 2024-06-04](https://www.montecarlodata.com/snowflake-summit-2024-keynote-recap-the-era-of-enterprise-ai/)\nWe’re covering the Snowflake Summit conference keynote for the third straight year (check out our 2022 and 2023 recaps). For Snowflake Summit 2024, festivities have moved from the Las Vegas desert to the San Francisco bay—and with its return to the tech capital came a whole list of buzzy new announcements.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSetting the Stage—Conference Pageantry and Neon Vibes\n\nCrossing the bigger-than-ever exhibitor “basecamp,” we shuffle to the keynote stage where we’re greeted by tasteful conference techno, lazer lights, and rollerbladers with ski poles.\n\nThe Moscone Center is one of the few locations that could hold this many people (rumors of a record 16,000 attendees this year add to the buzz), but still feel expansive. The keynote stage is the same.\n\nCapacity is massive and seats fill up gradually in the proceeding hour. One of my seatmates strikes up some small talk immediately disclaiming that he is on the business side and not very close to the tech, but excited to see what’s new.\n\nAs we wait, I Google to see if I can grab a sneak peek of any dropping news.\n\nIt’s hard to feel bad for a tech juggernaut, especially one that just announced record earnings, but I do feel a pang of empathy for the Snowflake press team as I’m hit with a wall of stories covering their denial of any culpability in the Ticketmaster breach. It looks like Snowflake is playing the cards close to the vest this year.\n\nThis year the stage will feature co-founder Benoît Dageville, EVP of product, Christian Kleinerman, and new CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy. Vegas is not laying odds on whether AI will feature prominently.\n\nThe opening video starts with big shots at big companies extolling the power of Snowflake. Fox, Paramount, and State Street rattle off one liners in quick succession.\n\nIt doesn’t really matter what they are saying–Snowflake is showing they have captured the hearts and minds of the C-suite in a way that we probably haven’t seen since Microsoft. Much of the keynote is directed to developers, but it would be a mistake to overlook what has made Snowflake a market juggernaut.\n\nGetting Geeky with Benoît\n\nAfter a short welcome and introduction from Sridhar Ramaswamy, Benoît takes the stage. There is an authenticity and energy to founder speakers that is hard to replicate, and Snowflake is wise to harness his swagger.\n\nHe gets a warm welcome from the crowd and immediately dives into the strategic vision of Snowflake which he outlines across 5 pillars. In a nutshell:\n\nData: The ability for Snowflake to handle all structured and unstructured data types.\n\nCompute: Elastic demand to run on any workloads. Not just separating compute from storage, but “compute from compute” with multiple workloads running on the same data.\n\nModels: Access to world class AI and LLM models including CortexAI and Arctic.\n\nGovernance: Snowpark Container Services and a unified platform for data and governance. “This is AI for enterprise, not AI for planning your next vacation.”\n\nCollaboration: Native apps and data sharing so you can share across regions and organizations.\n\nHis best line which drew some laughs was during the compute section when he reassured the audience that Snowflake was not a SQL engine contrary to what some might believe, “trust me I was there.” The long-term investment in the Dataflow engine, we are reminded, is the secret sauce that makes Snowflake the most efficient on the market.\n\nThroughout this overview of the big picture he hammered what is undoubtedly the central pillar of Snowflake’s strategic vision: simplicity.\n\nTaking A Journey With Christian Kleinerman\n\nThe rest of the keynote was MCed by Snowflake EVP of product Christian Kleinerman. He’s well suited to the role as a natural showman. You can feel the spontaneous energy coming from him, which is a welcome change from tightly scripted remarks, teleprompter reading, and stage blocking.\n\nThis year each product announcement is followed by a thumping sound effect letting the audience know it’s time to clap and creating a sense of building momentum. And on their own merits, the parade of announcements is genuinely exciting.\n\nIn this parade it’s easy to lose sight of what is perhaps the most ambitious move Snowflake is making. It’s not new and it’s not something they are trying to hide, but this year it became clear that they may be able to execute on the vision of being the “iPhone of data apps.”\n\nFor a company that owns the C-Suite like Microsoft, this Apple platform and tax vision is potentially game changing. In years past, it looked like the Snowflake Marketplace might sell you a ML app or a LLM model. As buzzy as those things are, they are pocket change and rapidly becoming commoditized. What Snowflake actually wants to sell you is each part of the modern data stack.\n\nThe exhibitor “basecamp” that is 8x the size of their competitors? All future apps to be purchased on your iPhone AI data cloud.\n\nBut let’s not digress too much. Let’s hop into each section of Christian’s talk: data, apps, AI.\n\nStrengthening the Data Foundation\n\nDocumentAI, Dynamic Tables, Iceberg, and Polaris\n\nChristian starts with reminding the crowd of the power of one of last year’s big announcements (and perhaps most unfortunately named feature): DocumentAI. This bland sounding feature actually describes the incredible capability to use natural language to ask questions about documents.\n\nWith flashing strobes and a big thump Christian announces DocumentAI will move to general availability. The well prompted crowd shows a fair amount of enthusiasm which is soon dwarfed by their reaction to Christian’s next announcement on the general availability of Dynamic Tables.\n\nDynamic Tables (which Monte Carlo supports) helps to transform data on load without the need for an additional target table. This feature simplifying the movement of data is exciting for all the data and analytical engineers in attendance.\n\nServerless Tasks, the open sourcing of the Polaris catalog, and the general availability of Iceberg across all crowds also get mentions and strong responses from the crowd. You have to wonder if Iceberg was set to get a greater share of the spotlight prior to the Databricks announcement earlier this morning regarding their acquisition of Tabular, the company founded by the original creators of Apache Iceberg.\n\nInterlude with Microsoft CVP Arun Ulagaratchagan\n\nArun took the stage next in a section that was a bit shoe-horned to demonstrate their partnership with Microsoft. Broad remarks on the importance of partnership, open source data formats, interoperability and Microsoft Fabric were made.\n\nWhile a bit tangential, it is nice to see the direction these platforms are taking toward interoperability and having Fabric OneLake queryable by Snowflake (even if it may be built on the back of Delta tables).\n\nGovernance, Compliance, Lineage\n\nChristian strode back on stage for the next set of data foundation announcements. Some of the bigger features highlighted included:\n\nUniversal Search: The one search bar that will help you find everything. Now generally available.\n\nInternal Marketplace: An extension of the Snowflake Marketplace but curated for your organization. Now in private preview\n\nAI Object Description: Leveraging CortexAI to automatically generate object descriptions. This is a feature included in many data catalogs that can sometimes seem superficial and counterintuitive. What you really want to understand from documentation is not usually what AI can intuit.\n\nData classification and custom classification: The ability to specify properties at the schema level or using specific rules to better identify, tag, and govern your data.\n\nObject Insights Interface: Horizon now contains upstream and downstream data lineage for a table within the Snowflake ecosystem. This includes ML lineage to models which is exciting. Snowflake has also introduced some basic data quality rule functionality.\n\nBuild and distribute apps\n\nContainer Services and Native Apps\n\nThis was the heart of the keynote and got the most energy from the crowd. It’s also the heart of their ambitious “iPhone” of the modern data stack strategy I detailed above.\n\nChristian relays the positive feedback Snowflake has received on both services before revealing that Snowflake Native Apps and Container Services will be fully integrated. So in other words, the native app framework that allows apps to be built, deployed, and monetized through the marketplace (and skip the procurement and security reviews) is now connected with the ability for developers to containerize their workloads in an accelerated dev cycle.\n\nI ran into a former colleague launching a financial application startup that is planning to aggressively take advantage of Snowpark Container Services and Native Apps. For them, these aren’t features, it’s going to be a big component of their competitive advantage.\n\nDemo Series with Jeff Hollan\n\nBecause “we’re integrating Container Services and Native Apps” undersells the vision, Snowflake Director of Product Management Jeff Hollan comes out to demonstrate. His energy is infectious and he’s clearly having fun, bad puns and all (I’m so excited I can barely contain myself).\n\nWe get three quick and compelling demos showing:\n\nAn app that uses hybrid tables to monitor telecom infrastructure uptime,\n\nA graph analytics native app that analyzes cell phone tower location and network resiliency, and\n\nA GenAI model running in Snowpark containers that is classifying the sentiment of customer support tickets and helping to generate responses.\n\nAll of the demos are impressive, but the crowd is especially responsive to the graphs analytics app as it dawns on them that a whole host of solutions that may have required quarter or year long procurement cycles could now be at their fingertips in minutes (if they have some spare Snowflake credits rattling around).\n\nThis is when it also dawns on me that Snowflake’s unique position of owning the data storage layer gives them an incredible opportunity not just to market a few shallow ML marketing spend optimization ML apps but to be the distribution channel for the modern data stack.\n\n“If you can dream it, you can build it in Snowflake.”\n\nDevOps, Snowflake Trail, and Notebooks\n\nChristian strides back on stage and takes a moment to feed off of Jeff’s energy and demo enthusiasm. He then quickly covers some features that I personally found to be among the most exciting.\n\nData reliability engineering has been rapidly maturing and trying to reach the auspicious milestones of site reliability engineering. Only recently have data teams started to treat their query code like their application code with processes like version control and pull requests.\n\nMonte Carlo, for example, will automatically correlate a code change to any data anomalies that may result from it.\n\nChristian’s announcements are in this vein of making query code a first class citizen including Git integration, database change management, Snowflake Notebooks and Snowflake CLI. He then also announced Snowflake Trail–a new observability (think application performance management not data observability) service that will help monitor code telemetry (metrics, traces, logs) across Snowflake.\n\nAccelerate AI\n\nWe have now made it to the third and final section of the three hour keynote and while the announcements are still exciting, energy levels are definitely starting to wane.\n\nChristian starts with asking the crowd who uses Pandas to do machine learning? And plays off the lack of raised hands joking, “looks like only Benoit.” Still, the Snowpark Pandas API entering public preview is a welcome addition. We then get a review of Snowflake end-to-end machine learning capabilities including the feature store and model registry (which Monte Carlo takes advantage of).\n\nWe’re now at the big AI announcements: Arctic, Snowflake Copilot, Cortex AI and Cortex Search.\n\nChristian puts Arctic, the LLMs built and released by Snowflake in the proper context. He didn’t overhype it as the next ChatGPT. He also struck the right balance between plugging its benefits in specific functions like generating SQL while pointing out there are a lot of models in the market with barely distinguishable performance metrics.\n\nChristian then plugged the more than 20,000 people using Snowflake Copilot as part of generating or fixing code in Snowflake before announcing that it is now generally available.\n\nCortexAI, which allows any user to query the data using natural language, seemed to be positioned a bit oddly as a replacement for data analysts and as a result got a more muted response from the very human crowd.\n\nInterlude with Snowflake Cortex with Amanda Kelly\n\nAmanda Kelly, Director of Product Management at Snowflake entered the stage for a clearly very well-rehearsed demo on Snowflake’s CortexAI, Snowflake’s fully managed service for hosting LLMs to –you guessed it – simplify the process for enterprise businesses to build GenAI apps.\n\nIt was pretty impressive to see her get a proof of concept for an app up and running within Snowflake in just minutes, and on the fly she prompted the LLM (in this case Mistral) to write an email “using a lot of happy emojis” – to which it happily and automatically obliged.\n\nThe Big Finale\n\nAnd then finally, for the penultimate announcement, Christian the Showman, took the biggest risk I’ve ever seen at a major tech keynote. It was fun, filled with promise, and a flop.\n\nI love that he and Snowflake went for it, and I hope the result doesn’t create future overly scripted keynotes. After repeating, “Cortex Search is so easy anyone can create a chatbot.” He proceeds to endeavor to prove his point by inviting a random member of the audience to conduct the next demo.\n\nWhat followed was a keynote demonstration for the ages.\n\nOur demo-er, Alicia, was truly a random member of the audience. Admitting that she’d only logged into Snowflake “a few times,” Alicia was excited to jump in head first. Unfortunately this ambitious, spontaneous demo ground to a halt as we learned that anyone can create a chatbot after a few attempts with Christian Kleinerman over your shoulder directing you where to click.\n\nUltimately, it’s a powerful message. Cortext Search can create a chatbot that only responds to information it knows within a professional context. It doesn’t know how to encourage your kids to eat more broccoli.\n\nOf course, Christian couldn’t resist the “oh and one more thing” Jobsian conference post-credits announcement. And in this regard, he certainly delivered. As we leave the keynote all of our Snowflake accounts have been transitioned to Dark Mode by default. A good ending to a good keynote.\n\nTwo years ago we had data warehouses and lakehouses. Today we have AI data clouds and data intelligence platforms. But the big takeaway this year is that data remains one of the most innovative and exciting industries to be in. I wouldn’t bet against these modern data platforms finding a way to make reality match the hype.\n\nOur promise: we will show you the product.",

      "# [Monte Carlo aids data observability with root cause analysis by Eric Avidon on 2024-10-07](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/news/366612784/Monte-Carlo-aids-data-observability-with-root-cause-analysis)\nNew capabilities\n\nData quality is imperative, perhaps more so now than ever as enterprise interest in AI increases and more processes get automated.\n\nWith data being the foundation for analytics and AI, data needs to be accurate for the decisions based on analytics and AI to likewise be accurate. Meanwhile, with data volume increasing exponentially and the complexity of data also rising, it's impossible for even teams of humans to monitor every data point and data set for quality.\n\nIn response, vendors such as Monte Carlo and other data observability specialists including Acceldata, Metaplane and Soda have developed platforms that automatically monitor data for quality and alert users when incidents occur.\n\nThose alerts, however, have to do with the data points and data sets rather than the underlying code. Therefore, to remedy an incident, data engineers and other experts still have to trace the incident back to its source -- its root cause -- before it can be fixed. That process can take on average 15 hours, according to a survey of more than 200 data professionals by Monte Carlo and Wakefield Research.\n\nThat's nearly two full workdays just to find the source of a single incident and get it remedied. Root cause analysis aims to eliminate much of the time and expense related to discovering and resolving the changes that cause data quality problems.\n\nData quality issues can often be traced to one of three causes, according to Gavish: problems with the data itself, something amiss in a system or trouble with code.\n\nMonte Carlo's new root cause analysis capabilities specifically target issues with Databricks and GitLab code, whether they are simple coding mistakes by developers and engineers or unforeseen consequences of intentional updates.\n\nDevelopers and engineers get alerts when incidents are detected, including information that correlates the incident with the specific change that caused it. As a result, downtime -- the time it takes to resolve data quality problems -- is reduced by about 80%, according to Monte Carlo.\n\n\"When it comes to resolving data issues, speed is everything,\" Gavish said. \"Being able to quickly root cause code-related issues leads to faster resolution. When you have visibility into data, systems and code issues all in one platform, it's much easier to understand the root cause.\"\n\nSpecifically, using Monte Carlo's new root cause analysis capabilities, the data observability vendor's customers can easily view Databricks query logs and query changes for each table. By doing so, they can see whether there was a query change to that particular table or a table in another part of the data pipeline, and if that change is the cause of the problem.\n\nSimilarly, Monte Carlo's new capabilities enable GitLab users to see which pull requests are linked to which tables. This can help users understand when those requests occurred and new code was merged, and if that new code is causing a data quality issue.\n\nGiven the visibility they enable, Monte Carlo's new root cause analysis capabilities for Databricks query code and GitLab pull requests are significant for the data observability vendor's customers, according to Petrie.\n\n\"Data teams frequently revise transformation code to meet changing business requirements, adjust formats, filter columns and so on,\" he said. \"While they try to minimize errors by branching and testing pipeline code, some problems inevitably get into production and break data quality. Monte Carlo helps data engineers spot those errors faster by autodetecting anomalous logs.\"\n\nGiven its potential impact for developers and engineers, Monte Carlo has plans to expand its data observability platform to include root cause analysis capabilities beyond Databricks and GitLab.\n\nDatabricks and GitLab are each popular environments for developers, with Databricks aggressively building an environment for developing generative AI, traditional AI and machine learning models during the past couple of years. However, many developers and engineers prefer other platforms for building data and AI models and applications.\n\nTo meet their needs, Monte Carlo plans to expand its root cause analysis capabilities beyond Databricks and GitLab, according to Gavish, though he did not specify which platforms the company plans to target next.\n\n\"We are constantly exploring and building new and stronger ways to enhance Monte Carlo's resolution capabilities,\" he said. \"We believe strongly in empowering our customers to resolve data issues right where they start.\"",

To lay the foundation for this, we have developed and benchmarked complementary strategies to multiplex brain organoids by pooling cells from different pluripotent stem cell (PSC) lines either during organoid generation (mosaic models) or before single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) library preparation (downstream multiplexing). We have also developed a new computational method, SCanSNP, and a consensus call to deconvolve cell identities, overcoming current criticalities in doublets and low-quality cell identification. We validated both multiplexing methods for charting neurodevelopmental trajectories at high resolution, thus linking specific individuals’ trajectories to genetic variation. Finally, we modeled their scalability across different multiplexing combinations and showed that mosaic organoids represent an enabling method for high-throughput settings. Together, this multiplexing suite of experimental and computational methods provides a highly scalable resource for brain disease and neurodiversity modeling. Main The polygenic underpinnings of human neurodiversity, in its physiological and pathological unfolding alike, have been eloquently referred to as terra incognita, calling for new maps to trace that unfolding in the authenticity of human genetic backgrounds and thereby render it mechanistically actionable. Developmental stochasticity and environmental triggers add to such complexity, and the increasingly broader range of exposome that is becoming measurable promises to make gene–environment interactions finally tractable at meaningful scales 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . Toward these overarching goals, brain organoid and single-cell multiomic technologies have afforded major strides in the mechanistic dissection of human neurodevelopment, enabling transformative insights from the study of genetic and environmental causes of neuropsychiatric disorders, a community-wide effort to which we and several others have been contributing 2 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 . Importantly, our recent benchmark of cortical brain organoids (CBOs) compared to the human fetal cortex confirmed the preservation in CBOs of transcriptional programs pinpointed as relevant for disease modeling 15 . Despite these advances, the characterization of brain organoids at single-cell resolution from entire cohorts and, in perspective, at population scale remains however an unmet challenge, although an obviously required one if we are to capture how individual genomes and developmental trajectories shape variability in vulnerability and resilience across the spectrum of neurodiversity 16 , 17 , 18 . Scaling up human brain organoid modeling and molecular profiling by single-cell omics would allow us to understand how the molecular causes of neurodevelopmental disorders trigger deviations from physiological trajectories 19 , in line with the expanding set of population-level single-cell studies 20 , 21 . This is however still an experimental and analytical challenge due to high cost and workload and to the inherent batch-to-batch variability of the complex experimental designs required. To overcome some of these problems, progress has been made in single-cell multiplexing strategies, including methods based on sample barcoding 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 and methods leveraging the detection of natural genetic variants 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 . These approaches have indeed proven to be instrumental for population genetics and disease-modeling studies, including through co-culture of cell lines derived from multiple donors in a single dish 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 . However, multiplexing has not yet been systematically applied to organoids, a challenge that is particularly relevant for the brain given the long-term longitudinal unfolding of highly heterogeneous combinations of cell types, and the field still lacks studies able to establish the experimental and computational viability of applying multiplexing strategies to complex three-dimensional experimental systems. We thus implemented and benchmarked complementary strategies to multiplex human brain organoidogenesis in vitro, pooling PSCs coming from different individuals either during organoid generation, termed the mosaic model according to standardized guidelines for brain organoid nomenclature we recently contributed to 40 , or before scRNA-seq library preparation. To improve genetic-based cell identification when dealing with brain organoid single-cell transcriptomes, we developed an in silico deconvolution method (SCanSNP), which we benchmarked against existing deconvolution tools, producing a consensus pipeline for robust genotype identification across datasets of different quality. Finally, we evaluated the two multiplexing paradigms through a deep reconstruction of neurodevelopmental trajectories, provided proof of principle of their suitability for linking genetic variation to neurodevelopmental trajectory phenotypes and modeled the scalability of the system, analyzing different multiplexing combinations with an increasing number of lines. This provides the community with an enabling resource for scaling up brain organoid modeling to the challenges of human neurodiversity. Results Single-cell analysis of multiplexed CBOs To test the feasibility of multiplexed brain organoid modeling over extended developmental time courses, we developed an experimental design comparing two approaches with distinctive features in terms of scaling, standardization potential and experimental challenges: (1) pooling PSC lines from multiple donors to generate mosaic CBOs (mCBOs) and (2) generating CBOs individually and pooling them only before single-cell droplet encapsulation (hereafter referred to as downstream multiplexing) (Fig. 1a and the Methods ). For the first strategy, we pooled PSC lines (5,000 cells per line) before organoid generation and longitudinally profiled the resulting mCBOs through scRNA-seq at 50, 100 and 300 d of differentiation, following the same protocol previously used and benchmarked in our laboratory 5 , 11 , 15 . For downstream multiplexing, CBOs were generated individually from the PSC lines and profiled at the same time points, pooling equal amounts of cells per line after organoid dissociation for single-cell library preparation. For both approaches, individual cell identity was demultiplexed through genetic variation (Fig. 1b ). Fig. 1: Schematic representation of multiplexing paradigms and experimental design. a, Representation of the two explored multiplexing paradigms. Left, downstream multiplexed organoids grown from individual lines and pooled in equal amounts after dissociation at the single-cell level. Right, mosaic organoids generated by pooling equal amounts of multiple PSC lines during organoid seeding.

The CBO differentiation time points, the number of replicates for each time point and their division between the two multiplexing paradigms and the PSC lines (genotypes) used for each experiment are shown. Figure created with BioRender.com . Experimental assessment of mCBOs We first characterized mCBOs by immunofluorescence for canonical markers of neurodevelopment previously defined for organoids differentiated with the same protocol by us and others 15 , 40 , 41 and confirmed their expected expression patterns (Fig. 2a,b and Extended Data Fig. 1a–c ). Next, to estimate the stability of the presence of the different PSC lines within mCBOs throughout development, we used a two-pronged approach. First, we longitudinally assessed the proliferation rate of organoids derived from individual lines in two differentiation replicates through flow cytometry-based cell cycle analysis. This showed similar proliferative trends across lines, with the expected decrease in proliferation along differentiation and no substantial variations in the proliferative rate of the different lines over time points (Fig. 2c,d and Supplementary Data 1 ). Next, we probed the extent to which individual lines, despite homogeneous proliferation rates in isolation, could still yield skewed distributions when grown as mosaics. In line with in vivo evidence of high asymmetric clonality during human brain development 42 , the quantification of genotypes from single-cell transcriptomics confirmed a variable degree of balance between individual lines during mCBO differentiation (Extended Data Fig. 2 ). Fig. 2: Experimental assessment of mCBOs. a,b, Immunofluorescence-based benchmarking of neurodevelopmental markers in mCBOs. At differentiation day 50 (a), mCBOs show consistent presence of ventricular-like structures positive for the neural stem cell marker nestin and are surrounded by a layer of cells expressing the outer radial glial marker HOPX. The presence of newborn deep-layer, Coup-TFI interacting protein 2 (CTIP2)+ (BCL11B) cortical neurons can be appreciated next to HOPX+ cells. On the outer surface, mCBOs reveal the presence of reelin+ cells. At differentiation day 100 (b), mCBOs display more mature ventricular structures characterized by the presence of HOPX+ outer radial glial cells, SATB homeobox 2 (SATB2)+ intermediate layer neurons and SRY-box transcription factor 2 (SOX2)+ neural precursors.

Benchmarking of demultiplexing algorithms The single-cell transcriptomics datasets generated from both mosaic and downstream multiplexed organoids at early, mid and late stages of differentiation (Fig. 1b ) were demultiplexed using three different state-of-the-art algorithms available for genetic demultiplexing (demuxlet 27 , souporcell 28 , Vireo 29 ). We observed a high number of predicted doublets with an unexpected read count distribution skewed toward low values when compared to singlets (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b ). This was associated with a variable degree of unassigned cells and identity call agreement among tools (Extended Data Fig. 3c,d ). We thus set out to develop a new method, SCanSNP (Fig. 3a ), to overcome the observed limitations by (1) dividing the classification challenge into two steps, one for identity assignment and one for doublet detection and (2) measuring the genetic purity of each droplet to identify low-quality droplets and separate them from authentic doublets. Finally, to consolidate deconvolution accuracy, we set a consensus call framework considering the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm, including non-genetic-based tools for doublets and low-quality cell detection 43 , 44 , merging their outcomes into one combined output (Fig. 3b ). Fig. 3: SCanSNP and consensus call overview and benchmark. a, Main steps of SCanSNP: (1) best ID assignment, (2) doublet classification and (3) low-quality droplet detection.

Algorithms are shown on the x axis, and mean log counts are shown on the y axis. The shape of each symbol corresponds to a dataset. Markers are colored by singlet or doublet predicted labels. Next, we performed demultiplexing again using all the above methods. We found that all three thus far available tools tended to overestimate doublets, if compared to the theoretically expected rate, SCanSNP or the consensus call (Fig. 3c ). Notably, doublets identified by SCanSNP and the consensus call were the only ones for which the average log count distribution of unique molecular identifiers was, as expected, higher than that for singlets (Fig. 3e ). This suggests a bias of existing algorithms in doublet detection that includes low-quality droplets that SCanSNP is instead able to identify (Extended Data Fig. 3c ). Accordingly, the evaluation of agreement rate in the assignment of individual identity across algorithms highlighted a high overall agreement for singlet calls, with cases of lower agreement coinciding with datasets that had higher genotype imbalance (Extended Data Fig. 3d ). On the other hand, we observed that doublet detection agreement was consistently lower (Extended Data Fig. 3d ). To additionally assess the demultiplexing performance of the different algorithms, we benchmarked them with ground truth priors using (1) five in silico multiplexed datasets with varying degree of balance among genotypes and (2) two ad hoc experiments in which the different genotypes were barcode tagged before pooling. As shown in Fig. 3d , in the simulated datasets, all demultiplexing algorithms performed better in balanced cases, and SCanSNP was the most accurate in both balanced and imbalanced settings. The superior performance (comparison against cellranger multi; Methods ) delivered by SCanSNP was confirmed in the barcode-tagged datasets (Extended Data Fig. 4 ). Analysis of neurodevelopmental cell types After deconvolving the identity of each droplet in our dataset by the consensus call, we discarded doublets and low-quality cells and proceeded with cells coming from the PSC lines across multiplexing modalities (Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1 ). We thus analyzed the single-cell transcriptomic dataset entailing four PSC lines, their time points and two multiplexing modalities (Fig. 1b ). We preprocessed each sample individually, integrated them and carried out multi-tier filtering. A force-directed graph was used to visualize the integrated dataset (Fig. 4a ). Fig. 4: Sample multiplexing allows identification of stage-specific neurodevelopmental cell populations. a, Cell embeddings in a force-directed graph after preprocessing and filtering.

The basis for the visualization is the force-directed graph. Dots represent groups of similar cells; color code indicates enrichment for the indicated categories (only shown for significantly enriched neighborhoods, spatial FDR < 0.1). We systematically annotated the identity of each cell population by analyzing the expression distribution of relevant markers, defining the gene signatures driving each cluster and projecting the cells onto a reference single-cell human fetal brain dataset (Fig. 4a , Extended Data Fig. 5a–c and Supplementary Data 2 ) 45 . Consistent with our previous benchmarking 15 and in line with evidence from recent studies characterizing brain organoids at single-cell resolution 46 , 47 , 48 , CBOs recapitulated most of the relevant neurodevelopmental cell populations of human corticogenesis. We observed a well-defined group of cells expressing the proliferative markers CDC20, MKI67 and TOP2A that were labeled as proliferating progenitor cells. Those cells are in continuity with a bigger cluster of cells expressing PAX6, VIM, SOX2 and NES and annotated as radial glia. This cluster undergoes a bifurcation, extending either toward cells expressing outer radial glial and/or astrocyte markers HOPX, AQP4 and S100B or the neuronal markers STMN2, DCX and GAP43, which we annotated accordingly. We then further divided the neuronal branch into intermediate progenitors expressing EOMES, two clusters of excitatory neurons expressing NEUROD2, TBR1, SATB2, SLC17A6, SLC17A7, SLA and GRIA2, two interneurons clusters expressing DLX2, DLX5, DLX6-AS1, GAD1 and GAD2, one cluster of migrating neurons expressing FOXP1, CA8 and LHX1 and one cluster expressing RELN, PAX6 and CBLN1, annotated as Cajal–Retzius-like cells (Fig. 4a,b and Extended Data Fig. 5b ). We then compared the different time points of our longitudinal dataset, observing, as expected, differences in cell type abundance. While radial glial progenitors, proliferating progenitors and maturing neurons were evenly distributed across time points, we observed that migrating neurons, early excitatory neurons and Cajal–Retzius-like cells were more abundant at the early and middle time points, whereas outer radial glia and/or astrocytes, late excitatory neurons and interneurons were more abundant at the late time point (Extended Data Fig. 5d ). Instead, cell type proportions between mosaic organoids and downstream multiplexed samples were comparable (Extended Data Fig. 5d ). We thus tested for statistical significance in differential abundance, leveraging Milo 45 , confirming significant differences across time points (Fig. 4c,d ). Conversely, the same analysis done comparing mosaic and downstream multiplexed samples showed no significant difference between the two multiplexing paradigms. To further investigate the molecular impact of mosaic culture, we compared the transcriptomes of the same genotypes between mosaic and downstream multiplexing and, as a reference for technical variability, we compared the same genotypes when grown in two different mosaic batches ( Methods ). The analysis highlighted a low number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for both comparisons (69 DEGs between multiplexing modalities and four DEGs between two mosaic batches, false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05, log (fold change (FC)) > 1.5) (Supplementary Fig. 1a and Supplementary Data 3 ). Finally, to further probe the transcriptional regulation of specific cell types in the CBOs vis-à-vis the in vivo counterparts, we took advantage of our multigenotype dataset to detect loci with allelic-specific expression (ASE) 46 , as the likelihood of observing heterozygous loci is higher. As expected, the number of detected loci with ASE correlated with the total amount of reads (Extended Data Fig. 5e ). Moreover, exploring the correlation of the proportion of reads in each allele across cell types, we observed that, also in CBOs, the patterns of ASE are cell type specific, in line with external evidence from the human brain 47 (Extended Data Fig. 5f ). Multiplexed CBOs capture key neurodevelopmental trajectories One of the most powerful innovations enabled by single-cell analysis of experimental models featuring extensive cellular heterogeneity, such as CBOs, is the possibility to analyze developmental trajectories through pseudotime analysis 49 , 50 . To deeply explore this aspect in our dataset, we leveraged partition-based graph abstraction (PAGA; Extended Data Fig. 6a ) 51 and isolated all biologically relevant lineages recapitulated in CBOs (progenitors → excitatory neurons, progenitors → interneurons, progenitors → astrocytes, progenitors → Cajal–Retzius-like cells, progenitors → migrating neurons). We could thus analyze through diffusion pseudotime (dpt) 52 how the single cells from the different time points and multiplexing modalities were distributed along those neurodevelopmental trajectories (Fig. 5a,b ). Moreover, we harnessed the power of trajectory-based differential expression based on generalized additive models (tradeSeq 53 ) and identified the key genes driving each lineage of differentiation (Extended Data Fig. 6b and Supplementary Data 4 ). Of note, for the excitatory lineage, trajectory analysis allowed us to identify two temporally divergent paths of neurogenesis that reconciled toward the end into the excitatory neuron clusters, where EOMES was one of the key drivers of the difference (Fig. 5a ). This is in line with the recent empirical demonstration of the ability of CBOs to recapitulate in a physiologically relevant way the two different patterns (direct and indirect) of human cortical neurogenesis 54 , 55 , 56 , 57 . Fig. 5: Multiplexed CBOs recapitulate key neurodevelopmental trajectories. a, Highlight of late and early excitatory neurons (N.) branches.

Linking genetic variation to neurodevelopmental phenotypes Genome-wide association studies have uncovered hundreds of thousands of genetic variants associated with human traits 48 . Mechanistically linking such variants to phenotypes of interest by molecular quantitative trait locus mapping has been instrumental to understand functional effects of genetic variation 58 . In particular, single-cell expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) modeling allows identification of the impact of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on cell type-specific molecular mechanisms, as we pioneered in ref. 59 , pushing forward previous work by the GTEx Consortium to characterize variation in gene expression across individuals and diverse tissues of the human body 60 . Moreover, because single-cell analysis can quantify longitudinal trajectories, it is possible to assess the effects of SNPs on traits that vary dynamically along a continuous axis 20 , 49 . The power of these approaches however has yet to be exploited for developmental variation as a trait per se that is now amenable to longitudinal quantitation in the form of single-cell resolved trajectories. We thus set out to leverage our in vitro cohort and probe as proof of principle how genetic variants could be linked to the neurodevelopmental traits quantified in CBOs. First, we empirically tested in our dataset the statistical power to perform single-cell eQTL analysis through our previously developed tool, scPower 50 , and identified the number of lines needed to perform single-cell de novo eQTL discovery, given the CBO-specific variability we had determined in terms of gene expression across neurodevelopmental cell types (Extended Data Fig. 6c ). Because, as expected with our dataset, we do not have the statistical power for de novo eQTL discovery, we followed a supervised approach to investigate the genetic basis of the differences we observed in neurodevelopmental trajectories between individuals during CBO differentiation. In particular, we focused on the trajectory of migrating neurons because it displayed the greater and most reproducible genotype diversity in the distribution of cells along pseudotime (computed by dpt; Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 6d ). Indeed, along this trajectory, upon downsampling cells per genotype to ensure balance within each time point (50 random sampling iterations), we found differences between two subgroups (of two individuals each) (Fig. 5c ). This was also confirmed by PCA performed on the downsampled dataset, where we observed the same genotypes’ separation along PC1 (Extended Data Fig. 7 ), which represents an alternative proxy of the differentiation trajectory of migrating neurons (Fig. 5b ). We thus explored in more depth the genetic variants that distinguish the two subgroups. Of the total of 24,987 coding variants passing the quality filters, 1,035 presented a different allelic configuration between the two groups, and we found that 11 of these genetic variants (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Data 5 ) have been previously identified as single-cell eQTLs in population-scale scRNA-seq profiling of induced PSC (iPSC)-derived neurons (Table 7 from Jerber et al. 35 , total reported eVariants from the study, 10,972). Two of these variants are cis-acting eQTLs for SRCIN1, one of the trajectory-specific highly variable genes (HVGs) we had identified (Fig. 5e ) that encodes a protein previously shown to be a regulator of disease-relevant alterations in cell migration and hence potentially representing the genetic underpinning of the neurodevelopmental difference in the migrating neuron trajectory observed here between the CBOs from different individuals. Scalability of multiplexed CBOs Having shown that multiplexed CBOs enable the parallel assessment of neurodevelopmental trajectories from different lines, we next sought to determine the scalability of the system, given the variable balance among lines during mosaic organoid differentiation (Extended Data Fig. 2 ) and recent evidence showing a high degree of clonal variability in brain organoid development 51 , 52 in line with the physiological clonality of human brain development 42 . We thus increased the number of PSC lines and multiplexing combinations as well as replicates across different organoids of the same combinations to quantitatively measure the variance in balance between different PSC lines in mosaic organoids and derive empirically grounded guidelines for scaling up disease modeling with this approach. To that end, we undertook an in-depth profiling of the growth rate of 12 different PSC lines by systematic and longitudinal imaging over different passages during pluripotency maintenance and at multiple time points during CBO differentiation. By performing semi-automated image preprocessing and segmentation 53 , we modeled the growth dynamics of each PSC line (both in pluripotency and upon CBO differentiation) and of seven different mosaic combinations (Extended Data Figs. 8 and 9 ). In parallel, each mosaic combination was profiled by Census-seq 36 , 37 at five different time points in triplicate to measure the PSC line balance over the mCBO differentiation course. This showed that, starting from a balanced mix of lines when generating mCBOs, the line balance was already altered at early stages of differentiation, resulting, for some of the lines, in very low numbers of cells at later time points (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Data 6 ). We thus asked whether these imbalance patterns could be predicted by individual lines’ growth rates. As shown in Fig. 6a and Supplementary Data 6 , for the contribution of each PSC line in mosaics, we found both that it was reproducible across replicates of the same mix and that it reflected line-specific behaviors across different mixes (Fig. 6a ), yet such regularity was not explained either by PSC or CBO growth rates (Supplementary Data 6 and Extended Data Fig. 10a ). This excludes that a rapid assessment of PSC line growth rates, either in pluripotency or upon differentiation, could be harnessed to preselect optimal mixes (that is, those most likely to preserve balance) for a high-scalability setting.

Shading around the line represents the 95% confidence interval around the mean, as depicted by the solid line connecting the dots. b, Growth rate of different cell lines for different mosaic mixtures in the interval of day 0 to day 4. Different cell lines are divided along the x axis; each dot in a box represents the growth rate of the same cell line in a different experimental mixture. Displayed by each box is the median (horizontal solid line within the box), the interquartile range (upper and lower bound of the boxes) and minimum and maximum values (extension of the whiskers) among mixtures per line. c, Fitted power function of cell line recovery (Monte Carlo simulation, Extended Data Fig. 10c ). The plot shows the number of mixed lines (x axis) and the number of recovered cell lines (y axis). d, Projection of the number of profilable lines over time across multiplexing approaches. The plot shows the number of profiled cell lines (y axis) and the experimental time in days (x axis). Vertical dashed lines represent the experimental time to reach 100 and 1,000 profiled cell lines in the left plot and the right plot, respectively. For the left plot, the approximation strict line is displayed for each protocol. We thus probed an alternative solution to the scalability problem, integrating the longitudinal Census-seq with mCBO imaging data to model mCBO clonal dynamics and thereby determine the upper feasibility limit of the mosaic models as a function of their sensitivity in exposing single-cell endophenotypes. Specifically, we derived the ‘mosaic growth rate’ of each PSC line by combining mosaic organoid growth rate as measured by imaging and the percentage of specific PSC lines as measured by Census-seq (Fig. 6b and Extended Data Fig. 10b ). We then computed the empirical probability distribution of the derived number of cells coming from each PSC line in mCBOs and used it as the basis for a Monte Carlo simulation with two initial parameters: (1) the starting number of PSC lines used to generate mCBOs and (2) the minimum number of cells per line required for single-cell analysis of the main cell types. We found that the number of effectively recovered lines (that is, lines detected at levels that enable single-cell analysis of the main neurodevelopmental cell types) increased with the number of lines that were mixed (despite the reduction in relative representation) (Fig. 6c and Extended Data Fig. 10c ). Given similar clonal dynamics across mCBOs generated by different numbers of PSC lines as well as by different combinations of PSC lines, the scalability of the system is currently limited only by the number of lines that can be accurately counted and multiplexed when generating mCBOs. We could thus compute the impact of the different multiplexing approaches (Fig. 6d and Extended Data Fig. 10d ) on the experimental timelines needed to perform large-scale disease-modeling studies. mCBOs emerged from this analysis as an enabling method due to the radical acceleration afforded by parallel processing of different rounds of differentiation experiments, for example, compressing the profiling of 1,000 lines down from 10 to 3 years and hence marking the difference, in the current funding and project management ecosystem of most academic institutions, between a largely unrealistic setting and a routinely feasible design. Discussion In this work, we developed multiplexing strategies to tackle the challenges of brain organoid modeling for the systematic study of human neurodiversity at scale. Pooling strategies already proved transforming for iPSC-based disease modeling 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 ; however, their application to the inherently complex setting of brain organoids, which generate a highly heterogeneous composition of cell types over very extended times, has just started to be undertaken 51 , 52 . Here, we first benchmarked and improved the demultiplexing steps by leveraging and aggregating the edges of different publicly available state-of-the-art algorithms and developing SCanSNP, a new deconvolution method that more accurately identifies doublets and low-quality cells and flexibly accommodates cases of imbalanced genotypes. Next, we deeply characterized the neurodevelopmental cell types and trajectories recapitulated by CBOs across time points and multiplexing modalities. Of note, the unicity of our longitudinal design allowed us to capture a very interesting and relevant neurodevelopmental process represented by the transient emergence of Cajal–Retzius-like cells, a population that was also recapitulated in a different brain organoid model but so far not reported in CBOs 54 . In our dataset, Cajal–Retzius-like neurons are enriched at middle stages and then depleted at advanced stages in both downstream CBOs and mCBOs, consistent with in vivo evidence that they are fated to elimination as neuronal networks mature 55 . Future studies will thus enable benchmarking the ability of CBOs to recapitulate also the specific molecular and cellular features of human Cajal–Retzius neurons in vivo. This design also allowed us to identify the developmental divergence of direct and indirect neurogenesis, highlighting EOMES as the key driver guiding the different paths of early-versus-late glutamatergic neuron differentiation in organoids. This confirmed the ability of CBOs to recapitulate the physiological processes of a unique aspect of human neocortical development 56 , 57 , in line with recent work that investigated these biological processes in early fetal tissue and cerebral organoids through imaging 61 . Finally, we observed in our late-stage CBOs also the differentiation of GABAergic neurons 62 , a finding that, given the dorsal forebrain patterning, is in line with recent evidence that human dorsal cortical progenitors are also capable of producing GABAergic neurons with the transcriptional characteristics of cortical interneurons 63 , 64 . Through the analysis of developmental trajectories, we also showed that brain organoid multiplexing can be used to identify how candidate genetic variants are linked to specific neurodevelopmental phenotypes, captured here as proof of principle in the transcriptional regulation of migrating neurons. This paves the way to molecular quantitative trait locus discovery once multiplexing approaches will be applied to CBOs differentiated from large-scale cohorts of PSC lines. Indeed, we showed that the number of lines needed for de novo discovery of eQTLs linked to neurodevelopmental trajectories in brain organoids (which we propose to term eDTL, for expressed developmental trait loci) should be in the range of hundreds of individuals. Both molecular and imaging analyses showed that mCBOs recapitulate the expected cytoarchitectural organization, including ventricular-like structures and the gradual emergence of relevant neurodevelopmental markers of standard CBOs. As expected, they showed a variable degree of balance among individual PSC lines. Differently from another multiplexing approach that was recently proposed, which requires however dissociation and re-aggregation of the organoids to keep the balance among individual lines 52 , here we aimed to keep the mosaic model unperturbed and thus allow it to recapitulate the physiological phenomenon of clonal asymmetry 51 , 65 , 66 , proceeding to an in-depth investigation of these dynamics across different numbers of PSC lines, multiplexing combinations and replicates. Interestingly, our longitudinal imaging profiling, characterizing with quantitative parameters each PSC line upon passaging in pluripotency and through CBO differentiation, did not explain the contribution of each line in the mosaic models. However, we cannot exclude that a growth rate characterization with even additional time points and/or replicates or at even higher resolution could lead to identification of a relationship between cell cycle and cell fate, as has been described in a different in vitro model 67 . In terms of clonal dynamics and scalability, while we cannot generalize our results for every PSC line, our results showed that: 1. As expected from recent studies 51 , 52 , the line balance in mCBOs is altered already at early stages of differentiation. This result, coupled with the lack of correlation with PSC and CBO growth rates, suggests that interindividual differences across PSC lines in response to the patterning factors used in CBO differentiation protocols (as also shown in ref. 68 ) may be a key determinant for the clonal asymmetry. However, with our data, we cannot exclude that the imbalance already originates during the first 2 d of the protocol, during which embryoid bodies are generated, a phenomenon that was also shown to be relevant in ref. 51 where the authors showed that clones were lost during the formation of embryoid bodies using a cerebral organoid protocol. 2. Mosaic models showed reproducibility in the relative abundance among different individual lines across replicates of the same multiplexing combinations and across different combinations. This points to the genetic background as a key determinant of clonal dynamics. Naturally, this does not per se rule out that also the epigenetic state of each line at the time of mCBO generation may exert a substantial impact, in line with results from a large collection of PSC lines 69 . Indeed, the lines that were overrepresented in the experiments in Fig. 6 were not overrepresented in previous single-cell transcriptomic experiments over different years and thus from different passages of the same iPSC lines. 3. The comparison between mosaic and downstream multiplexing modalities showed that non-cell-autonomous effects are not evident in the mosaic model, as expected, considering that we only used wild-type PSC lines to generate the single-cell dataset and confirming independent works that found the same result in two-dimensional 38 and three-dimensional 52 cultures. However, considering the few genes that emerged from the differential expression analysis between genotypes in the two multiplexing modalities, it is possible that, by increasing the number of cells and replicates and profiling mosaic models through spatial omics, the molecular impact of cell-to-cell interactions between different lines could come into relief even within the range of genetically normotypical lines. Also, it will be relevant to investigate deeper non-cell-autonomous effects using PSC lines carrying disease-relevant genetic mutations, such as the ones that already showed evidence that non-cell-autonomous mechanisms are relevant for the pathogenesis 70 , 71 . 4. The variance in mCBO clonal dynamics across PSC lines was not dependent on the specific mosaic combinations (where different lines were used) nor on the number of lines at generation, indicating high scalability of the system. Additional experiments will clarify the impact of increasing to hundreds of lines in single mCBOs on these clonal dynamics. However, considering the current limitations in laboratory settings for accurate cell counting, which is needed to generate balanced mCBOs (excluding flow cytometry setups for the logistics of generating mosaic models with many lines), we do not suggest going lower than about 1,000 cells per line during mCBO generation. Thus, our guidelines suggest using a maximum of about 20 lines in mosaic models (because 20,000 cells are needed to generate a mCBO with our current protocol). 5. Monte Carlo simulations incorporating the empirical growth rates from our experiments allowed us to compute the probability of recovering, from each PSC line, a sufficient number of cells for single-cell omics analysis of neurodevelopmental cell types, given the number of lines used at the generation. This in turn enables a precise design of disease-modeling experiments with mosaic models. With our protocol, the number of PSC lines that can be properly analyzed in terms of single-cell transcriptomic characterization of all major neurodevelopmental cell types (considering proliferating progenitors, radial glial progenitors, neurons, migrating neurons, excitatory neurons) from a mosaic experiment is ~12 lines (empirical mean ≈ 12.89; 95% confidence interval, 12.85 to 12.93) if starting from 20 lines and sequencing ~100,000 cells. This means that the ideal settings to apply mCBO designs as a transformative tool are cohort-level screenings for trait-relevant in vitro endophenotypes, drug screening and gene–environment interaction studies 72 . Indeed, if it is not crucial to recover all starting PSC lines, mCBOs allow studying the impact of genetic makeup, environmental chemicals 11 or drugs on the gene expression of specific neurodevelopmental cell types for very large cohorts of PSC lines, even without automated setups, as the only bottleneck is the maintenance of the lines and the generation of the organoids, thereby massively increasing the feasibility of large-scale experiments. For example, by leveraging large cohorts of banked PSC lines (with already thousands of lines available in standardized repositories (Table 2 from ref. 73 )) and generating batches of mCBOs with 20 lines, the experimental timeline for profiling at day 50 would be, respectively, halved for 100 lines (about 6 months instead of more than 1 year needed for a downstream multiplexing approach), more than three times lower for 1,000 lines (about 3 years instead of about 10 years with downstream) and substantially lower also than the recently introduced alternative approach based on post-re-aggregation multiplexing 52 . This, in addition to the substantial reduction in the workload (see specific calculations in the Methods ), represents a transformative leap for the transcriptomic annotation of polygenic risk scores along neurodevelopment and for precision neurotoxicology and pharmacology. To conclude, our findings indicate to opt for the downstream multiplexing strategy when the biological question at hand requires strict balance among individual lines, with the mosaic model ideally suited instead, and in fact transformative, for unbiased large-scale studies, in the same way as developmental neuroscientists can leverage pooled CRISPR perturbation strategies for screening the impact of genetic variants as a complementary approach to the validation of single mutations 74 , 75 , 76 , 77 . Methods Culture of pluripotent stem cells PSC lines were cultured under feeder-free conditions on Matrigel-coated plates at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 3% O2. To coat culture dishes, Matrigel solution was prepared by diluting Matrigel (Corning, 354277) 1:40 in ice-cold DMEM/F12 medium (Gibco, 11330057) and stored at 4 °C until use. Before plating cells, 6-cm dishes were coated with 1 ml Matrigel solution and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. PSCs were maintained in TeSR/E8 medium (Stemcell Technologies, 05990) supplemented with 100 U ml−1 penicillin and 100 µg ml−1 streptomycin (Thermo Fisher, 15140122) with daily medium changes and passaged 1:8 to 1:10 when confluency reached around 70%. To detach cells, plates were rinsed with 2–3 ml PBS (Gibco, 10010023) and treated with 0.5 ml ReLeSR reagent (Stemcell Technologies, 05872) for 5 min at 37 °C. When single-cell dissociation was needed, Accutase (Sigma-Aldrich, A6964) was used instead of ReLeSR, and 5 µM ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (Tocris, 1254) was added to the medium to enhance cell survival in the first 24 h. All participants signed an informed consent form, and the use of PSCs was approved by the ethical committee of the University of Milan. All iPSC lines were reprogrammed by at least 15 passages. All PSCs have been routinely verified to be Mycoplasma free by routine PCR testing, and their identity was confirmed by short tandem repeat profiling. Details about the PSC lines can be found in Supplementary Table 1 . Multiplexing strategies In the experimental design, we adopted two distinct multiplexing strategies, namely, mosaic and downstream, that differed in the moment at which the different cell lines were mixed. In the former multiplexing approach, CBOs were generated by mixing equal amounts of PSCs derived from each cell line to obtain mosaic brain organoids. Briefly, PSC lines were dissociated in parallel at the single-cell level, and cells were counted separately and then mixed in equal proportions to obtain a mosaic cellular suspension. After diluting the cell suspension to the desired concentration of 2 × 105 cells per ml, organoids were generated as explained in the following chapter entitled 'Cortical brain organoids'. In the downstream approach, CBOs were independently generated from each individual PSC line and grown separately. When reaching the desired analytical time point, organoids from each cell line were dissociated in parallel, and cells were counted and mixed in equal proportions to obtain a pooled cell suspension. For the comparison of neurodevelopmental cell types and trajectories between mosaic and downstream multiplexed CBOs, the design included four iPSC lines (CTL08A, CTL01, CTL02A, CTL04E) across replicates in both multiplexing modalities. For Census-seq-based assessment of mosaic organoid scalability, mCBOs were generated with different combinations of PSC lines as shown in Fig. 6a . Cortical brain organoids Pure line-derived and mosaic brain organoids were generated using an adaptation of the previously described protocol 78 , which allows one to obtain dorsal telencephalon cortical organoids, introducing orbital shaking on day 12 of differentiation as previously published by us in refs. 5 , 11 , 15 . PSCs were grown on Matrigel-coated plates to a confluency of approximately 60–70%, dissociated with Accutase (Sigma, A6964) and resuspended in TeSR/E8 medium supplemented with 5 µM ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (Tocris, 1254) to reach a final concentration of 2 × 105 cells per ml. The cell suspension (100 µl per well) was seeded in ultra-low-attachment, U-bottom 96-well plates (System Biosciences, MS9096UZ) and then centrifuged for 3 min at 150 rcf to promote formation of embryoid bodies. Plates were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 3% O2 for 2 d, and then the first medium change was performed, substituting TeSR/E8 with neural induction medium containing 80% DMEM/F12 medium (Gibco, 11330057), 20% knockout serum (Gibco, 10828028), non-essential amino acids (1:100, Sigma, M7145), 0.1 mM cell culture-grade 2-mercaptoethanol solution (Gibco, 31350010), GlutaMAX (1:100, Gibco, 35050061), penicillin at 100 U ml−1 and streptomycin at 100 μg ml−1 (Thermo Fisher, 15140122), 7 µM dorsomorphin (Sigma, P5499) and 10 µM TGF-β inhibitor SB431542 (MedChemExpress, HY-10431). Since that moment, defined as day 1, cultures were grown in normal oxygen conditions (21% O2). Medium changes were performed daily for the subsequent 4 d, and, on the fifth day, neural induction medium was substituted with complete neurobasal medium, composed of neurobasal medium (Gibco, 12348017), B-27 supplement without vitamin A (1:50, Gibco, 12587001), GlutaMAX (1:100, Gibco, 35050061), penicillin at 100 U ml−1 and streptomycin at 100 μg ml−1 (Thermo Fisher, 15140122) and 0.1 mM cell culture-grade 2-mercaptoethanol solution (Gibco, 31350010) supplemented with 20 ng ml−1 FGF2 (PeproTech, 100-18B) and 20 ng ml−1 EGF (PeproTech, AF-100-15). On day 12, organoids were transferred by pipetting with cut-end pipette tips from 96-well to 9-cm ultra-low-attachment dishes (System Biosciences, MS-90900Z) and placed on a standard orbital shaker (VWR Standard Orbital Shaker, Model 1000). From day 12 onward, medium changes were performed every other day. On day 23, FGF and EGF were replaced with 20 ng ml−1 BDNF (PeproTech, 450-02) and 20 ng ml−1 neurotrophin 3 (PeproTech, 450-03) to promote differentiation of neural progenitors. From day 42 onward, complete neurobasal medium without BDNF and NT3 was used, performing medium changes every other day. Cell cycle analysis Pure line-derived organoids were subjected to cell cycle analysis at multiple time points after their generation along with cell suspensions employed in their generation. Organoids were collected at differentiation days 0, 5, 12, 25, 50 and 75, dissociated at 37 °C for 5 min with trypsin-EDTA (Euroclone, ECB3042) (differentiation days 0, 5 and 12) or for 30 min with papain (Stemcell Technologies, 07466) (differentiation days 25, 50 and 75); papain was more efficient for the dissociation of mature organoids. As for the first analytical replicate (Fig. 2c ), cells were fixed with cold ethanol and stored at +4 °C. Upon completing the longitudinal cohort, cell suspensions were rinsed with PBS, stained overnight with 3 µM propidium iodide solution (Thermo Fisher, P1304MP) in the presence of 25 µg ml−1 RNase I (Thermo Fisher, EN0601) and analyzed with a FACSCelesta instrument (BD Biosciences) to measure DNA content. Analyses were performed with FlowJo version 10 software (BD Biosciences). In the second analytical replicate (Fig. 2d ), to avoid the deterioration of early time point samples, 1 million cells per sample were resuspended in PBS supplemented with 0.1% BSA (Sigma, A9418), stained for 20 min at 37 °C with 2 µg ml−1 Hoecst 33342 (Sigma-Aldrich, B2261) in the presence of 5 µM verapamil (Sigma, V4629) and analyzed with a CytoFLEX instrument (Beckman Coulter Life Sciences) to measure DNA content. Analyses were performed with FlowJo (replicate 1, BD Biosciences) or FCS Express 7 software (replicate 2, De Novo Software). Raw counts are shown in Supplementary Data 1 , and the gating strategy is shown in Supplementary Fig. 2 . Histological analysis Organoids were collected on differentiation days 50 and 100, washed with PBS and fixed overnight at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde–PBS solution (Santa Cruz, sc-281692). After rinsing with PBS twice, samples were embedded in 2% low melting agarose, placed in 70% (vol/vol) ethanol and immediately given to the Tissue Processing Unit for paraffin embedding, sectioning and routine hematoxylin–eosin staining. Deparaffinization and rehydration were achieved by consecutive passages of 5 min each in the following solutions: 2× histolemon (Carlo Erba, 454912), 100% ethanol, 95% ethanol, 80% ethanol and 2× ddH2O. Sections were then incubated for 45 min at 95 °C with 10 mM sodium citrate buffer (VWR Chemicals, 27833) with 0.05% Tween-20 (Sigma, P1379) for simultaneous antigen retrieval and permeabilization and then equilibrated at room temperature for at least 2 h. After 30 min of blocking with 5% normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 017-000-121) in PBS, incubation with primary antibodies in PBS with 5% normal donkey serum was performed. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-PAX6 (rabbit, 1:200, BioLegend), anti-TUJ1 (mouse, 1:1,000, BioLegend), anti-nestin (mouse, 1:500, Millipore), anti-reelin (mouse, 1:400, Millipore), anti-CTIP2 (rat, 1:400, Abcam), anti-SATB2 (mouse, 1:400, Abcam), anti-HOPX (rabbit, 1:500, Sigma), anti-SOX2 (goat, 1:1,000, R&D Systems), anti-MAP2 (guinea pig, 1:200, Synaptic Systems), anti-NeuN (mouse, 1:200, Abcam), anti-Ki-67 (rabbit, 1:250, Abcam). The day after, secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488, 594 or 647 (donkey, 1:400, Thermo Fisher) were diluted in PBS and applied to the sections for 1 h, followed by a 5-min incubation with 1 µg ml−1 DAPI solution. After each incubation, three 5-min washing steps with TBS buffer were performed. After a final rinse with deionized water, slides were dried and mounted using Mowiol mounting solution. Images at ×20, ×40 and ×63 magnification were acquired using a DM6 B MultiFluo microscope (Leica) equipped with an Andor Zyla VSC-04470 sCMOS camera (Fig. 2 ) or with an ECLIPSE Ti2 Crest microscope (Nikon) coupled with a Photometrics Prime 95B camera at ×20 magnification (Extended Data Fig. 1 ) and then processed with Fiji software. For Extended Data Fig. 1 , maximum intensity projection was performed, choosing the ‘maximum intensity’ option, and a gamma correction of 0.7 was applied to the AF488 channel. Cortical brain organoid processing for single-cell transcriptomic analysis Organoids were collected on differentiation days 50, 100, 250 and 300 (±3 d). Three to five organoids per condition were dissociated by incubation with a solution of 0.5 mg ml−1 Collagenase/Dispase (Sigma) with 0.22 mg ml−1 EDTA (Euroclone) and 10 µl DNase I at 1,000 U ml−1 (Zymo Research) for 30–45 min according to organoid size. Digested suspensions were filtered through 70-µm-pore Flowmi Cell Strainers (Sigma, BAH136800040), resuspended in PBS and counted using a TC20 Automated Cell Counter (Bio-Rad). For the day 100 downstream sample, the single-cell suspension was further centrifuged at 500 rcf for 3 min and resuspended in 200 µl cold PBS–0.04% BSA. Pre-chilled (800 µl) 100% methanol was added dropwise for a final concentration of 80%. Cells were fixed for 30 min and stored at −80 °C for 6 months. For recovery of a single-cell suspension, fixed cells were thawed at 4 °C (all steps at 4 °C) and centrifuged at 1,000 rcf for 5 min, the supernatant was completely removed, and pre-chilled SSC cocktail (3× SSC, 0.04% BSA, 1% SUPERase-In, 40 mM DTT) was added. Cells were counted and resuspended at a concentration 1,000 cells per µl. Droplet-based single-cell partitioning and scRNA-seq libraries were generated using the Chromium Single Cell 3′ Reagent v2 Kit (10x Genomics) following the manufacturer’s instructions 79 . Briefly, a small volume (6–8 μl) of single-cell suspension at a density of 1,000 cells per μl was mixed with RT–PCR master mix and immediately loaded together with Single Cell 3′ gel beads and partitioning oil into a Single Cell 3′ Chip. The gel beads were coated with unique primers bearing 10x cell barcodes, unique molecular identifiers and poly(dT) sequences. The chip was then loaded onto a Chromium instrument (10x Genomics) for single-cell GEM generation and barcoding. RNA transcripts from single cells were reverse transcribed within droplets to generate barcoded full-length cDNA. After emulsion disruption, cDNA molecules from each sample were pooled and pre-amplified. Finally, amplified cDNA was fragmented, and adaptor and sample indices were incorporated into finished libraries that were compatible with Illumina sequencing. The final libraries were quantified by real-time quantitative PCR and calibrated with an in-house control sequencing library. The size profiles of the pre-amplified cDNA and sequencing libraries were examined on the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 using a High Sensitivity DNA chip (Agilent). Two indexed libraries were pooled equimolarly and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform using the v2 Kit (Illumina) with a customized paired-end, dual-indexing (26/8/0/98-bp) format according to the recommendation of 10x Genomics. Using proper cluster density, a coverage of around 250 million reads per sample (2,000–5,000 cells) was obtained, corresponding to at least 50,000 reads per cell. Generation of CellPlex libraries Two independent downstream multiplexed datasets were generated for external validation of the SCanSNP pipeline, labeling each genotype with a specific barcode from the 3′ CellPlex Kit (10x Genomics, PN-1000261). Briefly, organoids were collected on day 50 and dissociated with an HBSS-based solution containing 30 U ml−1 papain (Stemcell, 07466) and 125 U ml−1 DNase I (Zymo Research) for 30–45 min according to organoid size. After filtering through 70-µm-pore Flowmi Cell Strainers, cells were counted, and 1 million live cells per sample were taken and labeled with a unique barcode from the 3′ CellPlex Kit Set A according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Once the washing steps were completed, 1 × 105 live cells per sample were pooled together, and the concentration was adjusted to be within 1.2–1.6 × 106 cells per ml for droplet-based single-cell partitioning. Libraries were generated using the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3′ v3.1 Kit (10x Genomics) similarly as described previously. Target coverage for gene expression was set at 50,000 reads per cell, whereas, for CellPlex multiplexing oligonucleotides, a sequencing depth of 5,000 reads per cell was chosen as recommended. Generation of bulk RNA-seq-based variant-calling file (VCF) Reference genotypes for the deconvolution were obtained from bulk RNA-seq data of pure line-derived organoids. Total RNA was isolated from pure line organoids with the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA quantification and integrity was assessed by electrophoretic analysis with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The TruSeq Stranded Total RNA LT Sample Prep Kit (Illumina) was used to run the library for each sample using 500 ng total RNA as the starting material. Sequencing was performed with the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform, sequencing on average 35 million 50-bp paired-end reads per sample. First, raw reads were aligned to the GRCh38 version 93 Ensembl reference genome using STAR 80 in two-pass mode to learn splicing junctions from data, subsequently, read group tags were made uniform, and optical and PCR-duplicated reads were marked using GATK MarkDuplicates. The resulting BAM file (in silico multiplexed BAM creation is described in the Supplementary Methods ) was recalibrated using BaseRecalibrator and ApplyBQSR with the sorted 00-All.vcf.gz (b151_GRCh38p7) file from dbSNP. Next, we performed variant calling using GATK HaplotypeCaller 81 with the option ‘dont-use-soft-clipped-bases’–standard-min-confidence-threshold-for-calling set to 30 and –min-base-quality-score equal to 20. We applied thresholds for MIN_DP, DP and quality (GQ) of 10, 10 and 20, respectively. Finally, we used CombineGVCFs and GenotypeGVCFs exclusively to merge together GVCFs of genotypes mixed in the corresponding single-cell experiment, ignoring the aggregated INFO field. Alignment and genotype demultiplexing scRNA-seq data were aligned using Cell Ranger 3.0.0 count and the matched reference provided from 10x. For subsequent demultiplexing and downstream analyses, only droplets passing the Cell Ranger filter were considered. For demultiplexing, we applied demuxlet, souporcell, Vireo and SCanSNP. The final identities used are the result of the consensus call (consensus call setup is described in the Supplementary Methods ). With the exception of souporcell, all the tools were provided with bulk RNA-seq-derived VCFs and were embedded in a collective singularity image. To optimize the deconvolution process for our samples, we used demuxlet with default parameters and the setting ‘–doublet-prior’ according to the number of retained droplets after Cell Ranger filtering and V3 kit specs doublet expectation. CellSNP, the Vireo companion tool for single-cell variant calling, was launched ‘with -p 10–minMAF 0.1–minCOUNT 20’, and subsequently Vireo was launched on the combined VCF file cleaned from loci containing missing calls. Souporcell was launched using the available singularity image specifying only the number of genotypes in the mixture (k). hiPSC lines included in this analysis are listed in Supplementary Table 1 . Single-cell data preparation All downstream analyses were performed within the SCANPY single-cell analysis framework 82 . Basic filtering was done right after importing count matrices from Cell Ranger. We inspected the number of genes, mitochondrial gene counts and ribosomal gene count distributions and adopted dataset-specific thresholds to remove droplets with likely technical issues. Next, we removed droplets called for low quality or doublets according to the consensus call. After merging the seven datasets, cell counts were normalized and log transformed using the ‘sc.pp.normalize_total’ and ‘sc.pp.log1p’ SCANPY functions. Finally, we regressed out the effect of total counts and the percentage of mitochondrial transcripts with the ‘sc.pp.regress_out’ and ‘sc.pp.scale’ functions. All functions were run with default parameters. Cell filtering and annotation We relied on multiple tiers of annotation, filtering and dimensionality reduction. First, we removed proteoglycan (WLS, ANXA2, TPBG, RSPO3, DCN, BGN, MYH3)-expressing cells, considered non-relevant for our downstream analyses. We next iteratively partitioned cells and assessed the top marker via Leiden and rank_gene_groups, respectively, to remove cells highly expressing adhesion (WLS, TPBG) and stress (BNIP3, PGK1, MT-CO2) markers while manually annotating cell types using literature markers. Finally, we used SCANPY’s score_genes function providing ER stress and hypoxia signatures to remove clusters of cells scoring >0 and >0.3, respectively. Finally, we repartitioned the remaining cells with a Leiden resolution of 0.6 and manually transferred the annotation to new clusters, merging, if needed, different partitions into coherent cell types when key markers were overlapping. Highly variable gene selection For HGV detection, we took advantage of having at least two datasets per time point and detected HVGs by time point with the ‘sc.pp.highly_variable_genes’ SCANPY function, providing each dataset as a separate batch and min_mean = 0.0125, max_mean = 5 and min_disp= 0.5 as parameters. For each time point, we kept only genes found as HVGs in at least two datasets. After major filtering and single-trajectory isolation, HVGs were recomputed on the cell subset in the same fashion. Moreover, we included some relevant neurodevelopmental genes from the literature regardless of whether they were detected as HVGs (Supplementary Data 2 ). Dimensionality reduction and dataset integration After filtering, PCA was computed on defined HVGs, and the seven datasets were integrated via SCANPY’s Harmony implementation 83 with a maximum of 20 iterations; the cells’ neighborhood graph was then computed on top 15 PCs, specifying 100 as the neighborhood size (n). Upon single-trajectory isolation, PCA was recomputed on each cell subset and branch-specific HVGs, Harmony was run with a maximum of 20 iterations, lambda = 2 and theta = 1, and cell neighborhood graphs were computed with ten PCs and 50 n; in the case of the excitatory neuron lineage, we used nine PCs and 60 n, given the greater differences between early and late branches than those within lineage-continuous cell states of other cases. Trajectory isolation To analyze the cell state transitions with trajectory-wise magnification, we isolated the most relevant neurodevelopmental trajectories. For this purpose, we first partitioned cells with the Leiden algorithm with double resolution (1.2) with respect to the previous partitioning and used it as the basis for PAGA 84 , obtaining a PAGA graph. The PAGA graph was refined by removing edges with weight <0.05. After complementing the edges to 1 to obtain the equivalent distance graph, we computed the shortest path from root r to each endpoint e using NetworkX 85 with the Bellman–Ford method, where r is the partition of cells with highest counts for the ‘TOP2A’ gene and e are partitions with the highest rate of the cell types considered one of the endpoints (astrocytes, Cajal–Retzius-like neurons, early excitatory neurons, late excitatory neurons, interneurons and migrating neurons).

      "# [How to Run a Monte Carlo Simulation in Excel: 5 Key Steps by Chris Bernard on 2024-05-20](https://www.datamation.com/big-data/how-to-run-monte-carlo-simulation-in-excel/)\nDatamation content and product recommendations are editorially independent. We may make money when you click on links to our partners. Learn More.\n\nMonte Carlo simulations are a mathematical technique used across a diverse range of industries and fields to model difficult-to-predict scenarios and outcomes. Despite their name, you don’t have to be a gambler to appreciate their value—in fact, Monte Carlo simulations were designed to take the gamble out of strategic decision-making processes by forecasting a wide range of potential outcomes of uncertain or unforeseen events.\n\nSpreadsheets are well-suited to this kind of data modeling, and learning how to run Monte Carlo simulations in Microsoft Excel or similar software can add a powerful predictive tool to your decision-making toolset. Follow along as I create a Monte Carlo simulation using a normal distribution to generate random variables to learn how to use this valuable technique in your own work.\n\nWhat is a Monte Carlo Simulation?\n\nIn simple terms, a Monte Carlo Simulation is a virtual representation of any statistical procedure that uses randomly generated numbers to solve a problem—more specifically, it generally refers to generating an array of results known as a distribution for any statistical problem that includes a wide range of inputs sampled over and over again.\n\nImagine yourself throwing dice. If you throw them hundreds of thousands or even millions of times, you begin to understand the odds of certain combinations coming up. Monte Carlo Simulations replicate this idea, letting us perform the same kind of statistical analysis quickly and efficiently. By varying the inputs, you can model a wide range of possible outcomes and compare them to help you make decisions in the real world, making this a popular and powerful predictive tool for businesses.\n\nStep 1: Set Up Your Monte Carlo Simulation\n\nLet’s say you’re creating a human resources report about salary levels at other similar companies in your industry. To build this report, you need a fictional but accurate representation of annual salaries per employee at a competing company.\n\nYou have data that suggests the average (mean) annual salary is $40,000, and the standard deviation is $10,000. You want to generate a random salary value based on a normal distribution with the specified mean and standard deviation—each time you recalculate the formula, it should generate a new random salary that follows the given distribution.\n\nThe first step is to set up the simulation in a blank Microsoft Excel sheet as follows:\n\nCreate two columns labeled “Trial Number” and “Normal Random Variable.”\n\nCreate two fields with corresponding labels for “Simulation Mean” and “Simulation Standard Deviation.”\n\nThe mean—often referred to as the arithmetic mean or average—is a statistical measure of central tendency that represents the sum of a set of values divided by the total number of observations in that set.\n\nStandard deviation and average/mean calculations are indispensable for ensuring your simulation conforms to expectations.\n\nStandard Deviation\n\nStandard deviation measures the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values by quantifying the extent to which the individual values in a dataset deviate from the mean.\n\nA low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean.\n\nA high standard deviation suggests that the values are spread out over a wider range.\n\nStandard deviation is calculated by taking the square root of the variance—the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean. When used together, the average/mean and standard deviation provide a more complete picture of the characteristics of a dataset. This allows you to assess the spread of data points and make informed conclusions about the variability and reliability of the dataset under analysis.\n\nNormal/Gaussian Distribution\n\nMonte Carlo simulations generate a series of random observations based on a specific type of statistical distribution. These distributions can be represented as probability curves that determine the likelihood of a particular outcome.\n\nThe Monte Carlo simulation I’m creating for this example uses a normal, or Gaussian, distribution—as a result, you can expect about 68 percent of the data to fall within one standard deviation of the mean, 95 percent within two standard deviations, and approximately 99.7 percent within three standard deviations.\n\nThe normal or Gaussian distribution is perhaps best known for its visual representation as the standard bell-shaped curve; when plotted, this function is characterized by an even distribution on each side, with tails that stretch to infinity on the X-axis.\n\nIn normal distributions, the median and mean values are the same—this leaves zero skew and a symmetrical graph. Normal distributions are appropriate for continuous data that has an equal likelihood of being above or below the mean, and are commonly used for measuring continuous data that hovers around a mean value. For example, instructors typically grade their students’ test scores on a normal distribution curve as a way to ensure fairness.\n\nStep 2: Create Rows for Your Trials or Iterations\n\nIn this example, let’s simulate 100 trials or iterations for a normal random variable with a mean of 40,000 and a standard deviation of 10,000. Here’s how to set that up in the Excel sheet:\n\nIn the “Trial Number” column, insert the first two sequential values (1 and 2) manually in the first two rows below the header.\n\nHighlight the two values—the draggable green edge will appear on the bottom right of the selection.\n\nDrag the green edge down the column to create 100 sequential row values in the “Trial Number” column.\n\nStep 3: Generate Your Random Value Variables\n\nMonte Carlo simulations in Excel rely on two functions in particular: RAND() and NORM.INV. The first, RAND(), introduces variability to simulate randomness by using a built-in formula to generate a random numeric decimal value between 0 and 1. The second, NORM.INV, returns the inverse of the normal cumulative distribution for the specified mean and standard deviation—in this example, 40,000 and 10,000 respectively.\n\nTo generate these values:\n\nInsert the following formula into the first field of your “Normal Random Variable” column:\n\n=NORM.INV(RAND(),40000,10000)\n\nSelect the value and drag the green edge down the column until you have 100 normal random variables for row values.\n\nStep 4: Verify Your Values\n\nIf you take a cursory glance at your resulting values, you’ll notice that they look fairly normal in terms of the distribution—as they should. We can verify this by calculating the mean/average and standard deviation for the entire generated dataset in your Monte Carlo Simulation:\n\nInsert the following formula into the field next to your “Simulation Mean” label to get the mean/average:\n\n=AVERAGE(B2:B101)\n\nBe sure to replace “B2:B101” with the actual data range in your spreadsheet.\n\nInsert the following formula into the field next to your “Standard Deviation” label to get the standard deviation for the data set:\n\n=STDEV(B2:B101)\n\nAgain, be sure to replace “B2:B101” with the actual data range in your spreadsheet.\n\nWIth these steps completed, your Monte Carlo Simulation results should resemble my outputs in the illustration below.\n\nIn comparing the hard-coded, specified average/mean and standard deviation values with the average/mean and standard deviation values generated from the simulated dataset, you’ll see that the values seem to be in line with expectations.\n\nAverage (mean) Standard Deviation Specified 40,000 10,000 Simulation 38504.53 9418.857\n\nStep 5: Visualize Your Monte Carlo Simulation Results\n\nSince we used the NORM.INV function to create your normal random variable values, the plot should resemble a standard bell-curve distribution. You can verify this in Excel by plotting out your results in a histogram;\n\nTo verify that your results conform to the expected normal distribution curvature, select all the values in the “Normal Random Variable” column.\n\nNext, select the “Insert” menu, and click the small arrow to expand the ribbon and show all available chart options.\n\nSelect “All Charts,” and choose Histogram from the list.\n\nThe resulting histogram visually represents the distribution of outcomes, grouped into bins, as in the following image.\n\nAs you can see, your Monte Carlo simulation conforms to a standard distribution—you can trace the lines contours of a bell-shaped curve on the outer edges of the histogram.\n\nRemember, our goal was to create a fictional representation of annual salaries at a company similar to your own in order to generate an HR report about salary levels at competing businesses, and your data suggested an average (mean) annual salary of $40,000 with a standard deviation of $10,000.\n\nUsing the results of our Monte Carlo simulation, you have a scientifically-derived sample dataset of hypothetical competitor salaries to compare against your own.\n\nUsing Other Monte Carlo Simulation Distribution Types in Excel\n\nAlong with normal/Gaussian distributions, Excel provides a number of statistical distribution types to use in Monte Carlo simulations.You can find them under the Formulas menu by selecting “More Functions” and then “Statistical.” There are a few that I find more useful than others, as they represent the more common distribution types.\n\nUniform Distribution\n\nIn a uniform distribution, an equal likelihood exists between the minimum and maximum values. Visually, a uniform distribution looks like a rectangle when plotted out on a graph. Uniform distributions are often used to generate random numbers and in other scenarios that involve events that are equally likely to occur.\n\nLog-Normal Distribution\n\nAs its name implies, a log-normal distribution has a normally distributed logarithm with the mean and standard deviation. Log-normal distributions skew to the right and are ideal for modeling rate descriptions—for example, time to repair, equipment failure rates, and income distributions.\n\nPoisson Distribution\n\nPoisson distributions are ideal for addressing large distributions near the start that quickly dissipate to a long tail on one side. They’re best for predicting the number of events that transpire within a given timeframe—for example, customer purchases per quarter or transactions per day.\n\nLimitations of Monte Carlo Simulations in Excel\n\nExcel can be a useful tool for many Monte Carlo simulations, but the software’s limitations as a desktop or Software as a Service (SaaS) application are worth keeping in mind.\n\nRandom Number Generation\n\nExcel’s built-in random number generator uses a pseudorandom number generator, and the quality of randomness may be a concern in certain use cases. Advanced simulations might require more sophisticated random number generation techniques.\n\nLimited Flexibility for Complex Models\n\nExcel may not be suitable for highly complex models that involve intricate interdependencies, non-linear relationships, or dynamic systems. I suggest using specialized simulation or statistical software or programming languages in these cases.\n\nLimited Support for Advanced Techniques\n\nSome advanced Monte Carlo simulation techniques such as adaptive sampling or advanced variance reduction methods are difficult to implement in Excel without resorting to complex workarounds.\n\nLack of Parallel Processing\n\nUnlike a cloud-based data warehouse or statistical package, Excel is incapable of parallel processing and horizontal scaling. This limits its performance capabilities when carrying out simulations, as it lacks the parallelization mechanisms to speed up computations.\n\nExcel Add-Ins for Working with Data\n\nData simulation—generating synthetic data to closely mimic the properties and characteristics of real-world data—can offer data scientists, engineers, and commercial enterprises access to training data at a fraction of the cost of real world data and open doors to all kinds of predictive modeling, risk assessment, and other benefits.\n\nMonte Carlo simulations are just one example of what’s possible—and while Excel’s wide range of statistical functions is sufficient for them in many cases, it lacks some of the more advanced statistical analysis tools required for in-depth analysis of simulation results. For this, I recommend that you install one of the many third-party and Microsoft-provided statistics add-ons directly from within Excel.\n\nEven with add-ins, however, desktop spreadsheet applications are not designed for heavy computational tasks. As the number of simulations or the complexity of the model increases, computation times can quickly overcome your system. For large-scale simulations, specialized statistics software packages or programming languages may be more efficient for advanced modeling purposes.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\nHow accurate are Monte Carlo simulations?\n\nMonte Carlo simulations estimate numerical results through random sampling, so the accuracy of the Monte Carlo simulation method increases with your sample size. That said, the accuracy level is also influenced by other factors such as the quality of the random number generator—for example, Excel’s random number generator is limited in this regard.\n\nHow many Monte Carlo simulations is enough?\n\nThe ideal sample size for your Monte Carlo simulation depends on various factors, including the desired level of precision and the characteristics of the modeled system/scenario. But you can use more advanced statistical tools to determine your ideal sample size. For example, running a sensitivity analysis will let you determine how changes in sample size impact the stability/reliability of your simulation; this involves running the simulation with different sample sizes and observing the variation in outcomes.\n\nDo Monte Carlo simulations assume a normal distribution?\n\nGenerally speaking, all simulations will assume a normal distribution if your sample size is large enough; however, depending on the specific context/nature of the simulated data, one of the other distribution types may be more appropriate for your use case. Running a sensitivity analysis will allow you to compare how different data distributions affect your outcome.\n\nCan I run a Monte Carlo simulation using software other than Excel?\n\nYes, you can use comparable spreadsheet programs like Google Sheets or Zoho Sheets to run a Monte Carlo simulation. Advanced statistical software packages like IBM SPSS and SAS offer more power and options when running Monte Carlo simulations, at the cost of a steep learning curve.\n\nThe Bottom Line: Running Monte Carlo Simulations in Excel\n\nMonte Carlo simulations are easy-to-use, powerful mechanisms for enterprise decision-making, risk assessment, and forecasting. Despite some limitations, Excel and similar spreadsheet tools remain competent options for carrying out rudimentary Monte Carlo simulations and should prove an indispensable statistical instrument in your analytical toolkit. For more sophisticated applications, I recommend that you consider specialized simulation software packages or programming languages like Python, R, or MATLAB.",
