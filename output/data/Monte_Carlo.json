      "# [Delivering End-to-End Data Trust with Snowflake and Monte Carlo by Scott O'Leary on 2021-04-29](https://www.montecarlodata.com/blog-snowflake/)\nAs companies increasingly leverage data-driven insights to drive innovation and maintain their competitive edge, it’s important that this data is accurate and reliable. With Monte Carlo and Snowflake’s strategic partnership, teams can finally trust their data through end-to-end Data Observability and automated lineage of their entire data ecosystem, all the way down to field-level values.\n\nHas your CEO ever told you that the numbers in a report you showed her looked way off?\n\nHas a customer ever called out errors in your product’s dashboards?\n\nWhat about a rise in a field’s null rate that went unnoticed for days or weeks because there wasn’t a noticeable change in your KPIs?\n\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, you’re not alone. Data downtime, in other words, periods of time when data is missing, inaccurate, or otherwise erroneous, is an all-too-familiar reality for even the best data teams, costing them millions of dollars in wasted revenue and up to 50 percent of the data engineering team’s time that could otherwise be spent moving the needle for the business.\n\nTo help companies trust their data, Monte Carlo is excited to announce our partnership with Snowflake by bringing our automated Data Observability Platform to the Data Cloud. Data teams relying on Snowflake to derive critical insights about their business can now leverage the power of automated anomaly detection, monitoring, and end-to-end lineage to prevent bad data from affecting downstream consumers.\n\nAchieving reliable Snowflake pipelines with data observability\n\nThe Snowflake – Monte Carlo integration makes it easy for data organizations to identify, resolve, and prevent data downtime and data quality issues before they impact the business, giving companies confidence in the reliability of their data and the products they power.\n\nWith this partnership, Snowflake customers can now:\n\nAchieve end-to-end Data Observability without writing any code. Get end-to-end data observability for your Snowflake data pipelines with a 20-minute, no-code implementation process. Access out-of-the-box visibility into data Freshness, Volume, Distribution, Schema, and Lineage just by plugging Monte Carlo into your Data Cloud.\n\nKnow when data breaks, as soon as it happens. Monte Carlo continuously monitors your Snowflake assets and proactively alerts stakeholders to data issues. Monte Carlo’s machine learning-first approach gives data teams broad coverage for common data issues with minimal configuration, and business-context-specific checks layered on top ensure you’re covered at each stage of your data pipeline.\n\nFind the root cause of data quality issues, fast. Monte Carlo gives teams a single pane of glass to investigate data issues, drastically reducing time to resolution. By bringing all information and context for your pipelines into one place, teams spend less time firefighting data issues and more time improving the business.\n\nImmediately understand the business impact of bad data. End-to-end lineage for your pipelines from the point it enters Snowflake (or further upstream!) down to the analytics and business intelligence layer, data teams are able to assess the business impact of their data issues, ultimately preventing decision making based on bad data.\n\nPrevent data downtime. Give your teams full visibility into your Snowflake pipelines and how they impact downstream reports and dashboards to make more informed development decisions. With Monte Carlo, teams can better manage breaking changes to ELTs and BI assets by knowing what will be impacted and who to notify.\n\nIn addition to supporting existing mutual customers, Monte Carlo provides end-to-end, automated coverage for teams migrating from their legacy stacks to the Snowflake Data Cloud Platform. Moreover, Monte Carlo’s security-first approach to Data Observability ensures that data never leaves your Snowflake environment.\n\nWhat Monte Carlo and Snowflake customers have to say\n\nThe Zebra\n\nThe Zebra, a leading insurance comparison site, makes it easy for consumers across the United States to compare and save on car and home insurance quotes. The company provides over 1,800 car insurance products from more than 200 national insurers, a monumental feat that relies on real-time decision making powered by data from disparate third-party vendors and partners. The Zebra’s data team uses Snowflake and Monte Carlo to ensure that their data pipelines are performant and reliable.\n\n“As a data leader, there’s nothing worse than not being able to trust your data,” said Shea Spalding, Head of Data Governance at The Zebra. “The combination of Snowflake’s data cloud and Monte Carlo’s data observability platform helps ensure that our data is accessible and fresh at each stage of the data life cycle. With this stack, my team can better collaborate to resolve issues, work towards data trust, and build better products for our customers.”\n\nMindbody\n\nAs the world’s leading wellness services marketplace, Mindbody is a company with data at heart. Alex Soria, VP of Data & Analytics, is leading the charge with a team of over 25 data scientists, business intelligence analysts, and data engineers responsible for ensuring that the insights powering their product is fresh and reliable.\n\nAs the world’s leading wellness services marketplace, Mindbody is a company with data at heart. Alex Soria, VP of Data & Analytics, is leading the charge with a team of over 25 data scientists, business intelligence analysts, and data engineers responsible for ensuring that the insights powering their product is fresh and reliable.\n\n“Data-driven decision making is a huge priority for Mindbody, but our analytics are only as reliable as the data that informs them,” said Alex. “We are working with Monte Carlo to monitor and alert for abnormalities in our Snowflake pipelines, such as null values and duplicate data, that would otherwise go unnoticed until it’s too late. By partnering with Snowflake and Monte Carlo, my team can achieve more powerful analytics and full data reliability.”\n\nCollaborative Imaging\n\nCollaborative Imaging is a radiologist-owned alliance dedicated to improving the lives of physicians and patients everywhere through technology. With over 18,000 patients seen per day and nearly 1M radiological exams read per month, the alliance is charting a course for the future of this industry by giving providers the solutions and processes necessary to better serve their communities.\n\nTo power their business, Collaborative Imaging needs fast analytics powered by clean and reliable data, which is no easy feat given the size and scope of their distributed data ecosystem. To gain greater visibility into the health of their data at each stage of its life cycle, they needed a way to understand how data flows into their data warehouse, as well as be alerted when changes occur in schema or distribution of the many data sources which are ingested into their Snowflake data warehouse. Monte Carlo empowered them to troubleshoot and resolve issues before downstream data consumers are impacted.\n\n“Collaborative Imaging’s analytics platform helps physicians and patients connect the dots between disparate data points in their healthcare journey, but our insights are only as reliable as the data feeding our system. Dirty data is a landmark of healthcare analytics, and a lot of the work we do revolves around cleaning and making sense of this data to put it into one repository,” said Jacob. “Combined with Snowflake’s powerful Data Cloud and Monte Carlo’s Data Observability Platform, we can resolve these problems before they reach the business. My executives are happy and I can trust our data.”\n\nWant to learn more about how data observability can help you trust your data?

We combine information that we have collected across other third party sites. We combine information across devices, such as computers and mobile devices. We may also combine information we get from a third party with information we already have.\n\nWill Company Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives?\n\nMonte Carlo does not and will not sell your Personal Information. We may, however, share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this section:\n\nVendors/Subprocessors: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and may need to share your Personal Information with them to provide the Services to you, which may include for the creation and maintenance of accounts, collection and analysis of data, provision of technical support, or provision of specific business services such as synchronization with other software applications and marketing services. Vendors and Subprocessors are permitted to use the Personal Information we share with them only as necessary to assist us in the provision of the Services and are required by written agreement not to retain, use or disclose your Personal Information for any other purpose.\n\nBusiness Transfers: We may choose to buy or sell assets or our company and may share and/or transfer customer information in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.\n\nProtection of Company and Others: We may access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our terms and conditions and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety and security of Monte Carlo, our employees, our users, or others.\n\nSecurity Of Your Personal Information\n\nWe use a variety of industry-standard security measures to help protect your Personal Information as required by relevant law. We also require you to enter a password to access your account information. Please do not disclose your account password to unauthorized persons. Although we are committed to protecting your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Additionally, our customers and your employer must prevent unauthorized access to accounts and Personal Information by selecting and protecting passwords appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser.\n\nHow Is My Personal Information Retained?\n\nWe keep Personal Information as long as it is necessary or relevant for the purposes for which it was collected and in compliance with our retention policies. We also keep information as otherwise required by law.\n\nTo determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider not only applicable legal requirements, but also the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Information, the purposes for which we process your Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means.\n\nWhat Choices Do I Have Regarding My Personal Information?\n\nYou can choose not to disclose Personal Information to us, but keep in mind that if you are a customer or an employee of a customer, some Personal Information may be needed to register with us or to take advantage of some of our Service features.\n\nIf Personal Information covered by this Privacy Policy is to be used for a new purpose that is materially different from that for which the Personal Information was originally collected or subsequently authorized, or is to be disclosed to a non-agent third party in a manner not specified in this Privacy Policy, Monte Carlo will provide you with an opportunity to choose whether to have our Personal Information so used or disclosed. Requests to opt-out of such uses or disclosures of Personal Information should be sent to us at privacy@montecarlodata.com.\n\nCertain Personal Information, such as information about medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, is considered “sensitive information.” Monte Carlo will not use sensitive information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you unless we have received your affirmative and explicit consent (opt-in).\n\nTo stop receiving our promotional emails follow the instructions in any promotional message you get from us or contact us as described at the end of this Privacy Policy. If you opt out of getting marketing messages, you will continue to receive messages from us about your relationship with us where permitted by law.\n\nYou may request deletion of your information or account by sending a request to privacy@montecarlodata.com. If you are an employee of one of our customers, we will refer your request to that Monte Carlo customer. Some information may remain in our records after your deletion request.\n\nYou can control cookies and tracking tools. To learn how we - and our vendors - use cookies and other tracking tools, and to read our Do Not Track policy, please click here.\n\nYour Legal Rights Regarding Your Personal Information\n\nUnder certain circumstances you may have rights under applicable data protection laws in relation to your Personal Information. Where applicable, you may have the right to:\n\nRequest information about how we collect, process, use and share your Personal Information (commonly known as a “right to know request”).\n\nRequest access to your Personal Data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.\n\nRequest correction of the Personal Information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.\n\nRequest erasure of your Personal Information (commonly known as a “request to be forgotten”). This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Information. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your Personal Information to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply in full with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.\n\nObject to processing of your Personal Information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.\n\nRequest restriction of processing of your Personal Information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Information in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.\n\nRequest the transfer of your Personal Information to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.\n\nWithdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain Services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.\n\nIf you wish to exercise any of the above rights please contact privacy@montecarlodata.com. You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of the other rights), and Monte Carlo does not discriminate based on whether you choose to exercise your choice and rights. We will not, based on your exercise of rights, deny our Services to you, charge you different rates, provide a different level or quality of Services to you, or suggest that you may receive such different treatment. However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.\n\nAdditionally, we may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. As part of the verification process, we match the information submitted as part of your request against information stored by Monte Carlo. In some instances, we will require additional information in order to verify your request. If an authorized third party makes a data subject request on your behalf, we will require sufficient written proof that you have designated them as your authorized agent. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within 30 days. Occasionally it may take us longer than 30 days if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.\n\nCalifornia Residents’ Rights\n\nSubject to certain limitations, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides California consumers the right to request to know more details about the categories or specific pieces of Personal Information we collect (including how we use and disclose this information), to delete their Personal Information, to opt out of any “sales” that may be occurring, and to not be discriminated against for exercising these rights. If you are a resident of California (or another jurisdiction that provides comparable rights) and would like to make a request, please contact us 548 Market Street, PMB 59994, San Francisco, CA 94104 or via email at privacy@montecarlodata.com. If you are submitting on someone else’s behalf, we may ask for additional information to verify your identity. This may include providing a signed letter verifying your right to make this request. We do not sell Personal Information to third parties for money or any other consideration, as that term is generally understood. We do not sell Personal Information of minors under the age of 16. We will not discriminate against you because you have exercised any of your rights under the CCPA.\n\nFor EU, UK and Swiss Residents\n\nIf Personal Information pertaining to you as an individual has been submitted to the Services by or on behalf of one of our customers and you wish to exercise any data protection rights you may have in respect of that data under applicable law, including (as applicable) the right to access, port, correct, amend or delete such data, please inquire with the relevant Monte Carlo customer directly. We have a limited ability to access the content of our customers. However, if you wish to make your request directly to us, please provide the name of the Monte Carlo customer who submitted your data to our Services. We will refer your request to that Monte Carlo customer.\n\nData Privacy Framework Statement\n\nMonte Carlo complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. This includes with respect to Personal Information provided to us by our customers for processing on behalf of the customer in the provision of our Services.\n\nMonte Carlo has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of Personal Information transferred from the European Union and the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar), and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of Personal Information transferred from Switzerland. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/.\n\nMonte Carlo uses third party subprocessors to help us provide our Services and those subprocessors may process Personal Information. If you are an EU, UK or Swiss individual, where we transfer your Personal Information to a third party subprocessor, we are responsible for the processing of that Personal Information by them and shall remain responsible and liable under the DPF Principles for our third party subprocessors as set forth in the DPF Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.\n\nEU, UK and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of Personal Information received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, should first contact Monte Carlo at: privacy@montecarlodata.com. In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, Monte Carlo commits to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of Personal Information to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit https://www.jamsadr.com/dpf-dispute-resolution for more information or to file a complaint. The services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you. Under certain conditions, as further explained in the DPF Principles, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted. Monte Carlo is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, Monte Carlo may be required to disclose Personal Information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.\n\nOur Services Are Not Intended For Children\n\nWe do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at privacy@montecarlodata.com.\n\nThird Party Sites And Services\n\nIf you click on a link to a third party website or service, a third party may also transmit cookies to you. Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t responsible for their privacy policies and practices. Please be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third parties may not honor “Do Not Track” requests you have set using your browser or device.\n\nUpdates To This Privacy Policy\n\nWe may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes to our Privacy Policy as required by law. We will also post an updated copy on the sites where this appears. Please check our site periodically for updates.",
      "# [Cookie Policy by Ryan Kelch on 2022-09-12](https://www.montecarlodata.com/cookie-policy/)\nWe Use Tracking Tools\n\nWe collect personal information about users over time and across different websites when you use this website or service. We also have third parties that collect personal information this way. To do this, we use several common tracking tools. These may include browser cookies. We may also use web beacons, flash cookies, and similar technologies.

Interest-based advertising or “online behavioral advertising” is serving advertising content to you based on information gathered from you over time across multiple sites or other platforms. It includes serving ads to you after you leave our website, encouraging you to return. It also includes serving ads we think are relevant based on your browsing habits or online activities. These ads might be served on websites. They might also be served in emails. We might serve these ads, or third parties may serve ads. They might be about our products or services other companies’ products or services.\n\nWe may also use tracking tools:\n\nTo recognize new or past website visitors.\n\nTo improve our website and to better understand your visits on our platforms.\n\nTo integrate with third party social media websites.\n\nTo observe your behaviors and browsing activities over time across multiple websites or other platforms.\n\nTo better understand the interests of our customers and our website visitors.\n\nHow We Gather Information For Interest-Based Advertising\n\nWe use information you make available to us when you interact with us, our affiliates, and other third parties to decide what content is relevant to you. We gather this information using the tracking tools described above. For example, we or our partners might look at your browsing behaviors. We or our partners might also look at your location. We might look at these activities on our platforms or the\n\nplatforms of others.\n\nWe work with third parties who help gather this information. These third parties might link your name or email address to other information they collect. This might include online usage information.\n\nHow To Control Certain Tracking Tools\n\nYour browser may give you the ability to control cookies. How you do so depends on the type of cookie. You can set your browser to reject cookies. To find out more about how to control cookies from your web browser, please visit here. To control flash cookies, which we may use, you can go here. Why? Because flash cookies cannot be controlled through your browser settings.\n\nOur Do Not Track Policy: Some browsers have “do not track” features that allow you to tell a website not to track you. These features are not all uniform. We do not currently respond to those signals. If you block cookies, certain features on our sites may not work. If you block or reject cookies, not all of the tracking described here will stop.\n\nChoices you make are both browser and device specific.\n\nHow To Control Interest-Based Advertising\n\nThe Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising program provides consumers with the ability to opt-out of having their online behavior recorded and used for advertising purposes. To opt-out of interest based advertising you can visit here and follow the instructions on that page.\n\nThe Digital Advertising Alliance also offers a tool for opting out of the collection of cross-app data on a mobile device for interest-based advertising. To exercise choice for companies participating in this tool, download the AppChoices app here . Your mobile device may also provide its own instructions on how to prevent interest-based advertisements. We do not control how the device operator allows you to do this. You should review their support materials and/or the device settings.",
      "# [Monte Carlo by Lior Gavish on 2020-06-25](https://www.montecarlodata.com/about-us/)\nMonte Carlo was founded to help organizations deliver on the promise of data.\n\nBarr Moses, founder of Monte Carlo, worked with Fortune 500 companies as VP of Customer Operations at Gainsight to help teams use data as a competitive advantage. Lior Gavish, Barr’s co-founder, was formerly SVP of Engineering at Barracuda where he built fraud detection systems powered by data, ML, and analytics.\n\nThey were both struck by the fact that great tools were available to identify and resolve infrastructure issues, but there was no easy way to guarantee the validity of data flowing through pipelines."

All just to create more buzz and spam the name everywhere without really showing what it is about or having some fremium/OSS core. \n\nIMO reading about what they do, I feel like you can achieve all of this by sticking to existing software tooling (collect metrics [e.g. datadog], build observability into you data testing and log that as you would log everything else, or save as metadata etc.).

It plugs into the data stack, collects metadata, metrics and logs and provides visibility into data health. Lots of stuff works out of the box so we didn't have to customize it too much to get coverage for our pipelines.

I really recommend these lectures. He's a fantastic teacher. This is his current semester, so it's not yet complete. Previous years' courses are also available if you outpace his output. \n\nMC methods are surprisingly powerful for how simple they are, conceptually. Firstly, they can replace the ocean of test statistics that you have to grapple with using frequentist methods. With a single process you can do pretty much any hypothesis test without basing the overall assessment of the hypothesis on an arbitrary cutoff point like alpha=5%.\n\nYou can incorporate domain knowledge in your models. If, for example, you know that a parameter *has* to be positive (because it's a count of some real world thing) and also should probably be somewhere between 5 and 10, and is very unlikely to be 10,000 you can include this in your model even if you don't have any data for it.\n\nMC methods also let you design relationships between variables, let you get information about unobserved quantities that either affect or are affected by observed quantities, can be used as part of a causal analysis, can give you a tool for simulating a contra-positive (what would have happened otherwise), can give you highly explainable results, can work on smaller data sets, can give you not only point estimates but credible intervals (which are much more intuitive to non-technical people than confidence intervals are).\n\n### Comment ID j5ztk8k with +1 score by [(Coco_Dirichlet, Reddit, 2023-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10ljew2/monte_carlo_simulation/j5ztk8k/) (in reply to ID j5yyfh4):\nMCMC is not the same as MC\n\n## Comment ID j5ylvf6 with +5 score by [(OneSprinkles6720, Reddit, 2023-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10ljew2/monte_carlo_simulation/j5ylvf6/) (in reply to ID 10ljew2):\nMonte carlo gives me guidelines I can use to yank a financial markets trading algo out of production.

I frequently use them to come up with valuations of complex instruments like options and earnout payments (a future payment made to the previous owner of an acquired company based on future performance metrics). \n\nFor earnouts specifically, there is no way to determine the actual value since it depends on future performance of the company. A MC simulation helps come up with the most likely value by simulating different levels of future performance and buyout scenarios, which is needed for financial reporting purposes.\n\nFor earnouts, I use a software package called Crystal Ball which has an Excel plugin. For options, I usually just use Python.\n\n### Comment ID j60iq5v with +2 score by [(notfuckingcurious, Reddit, 2023-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10ljew2/monte_carlo_simulation/j60iq5v/) (in reply to ID j5zn3pt):\nTalking about Options muddies the water a bit eh because people are used to there being a closed form solution in Black Scholes. Of course exotic options that have knockouts or whatever don't have closed form solutions and Monty Carlo simulations are really the only way to model payoffs there. It was exactly this use case that really got me to see some of the usefulness and nuances of MC sims. E.g. if you have a meaningful price barrier in the payoff function, the granularity of the simulation effects accuracy (i.e. you won't capture some plausible intraday crossing of said barrier if you simulate hours/days etc).\n\n#### Comment ID j60r8jc with +1 score by [(EMoneymaker99, Reddit, 2023-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10ljew2/monte_carlo_simulation/j60r8jc/) (in reply to ID j60iq5v):\nYeah, for vanilla options I use a BSM but for exotics MC is usually the way to go, like you said.

How do you calculate the uncertainty for those predictions/predicted probabilities? Well, the easiest way to go about it is by doing MC simulation because in non-linear models, the uncertainty for each prediction is going to change for each value of X.\n\nYou can also use Monte Carlo simulations for cross-validation.\n\nYou can also use Monte Carlo simulations when you are comparing a series of different models performance, on average, with a lot of data you simulated (fake data) that has a particular problem (e.g. heteroskedastic data, or serially correlated data).\n\nAnd can people in the comments spot implying MCMC is the same as MC. It's not! MCMC includes an MC, but OP asked about MC. They aren't used for the same problems. If you take a Bayesian Stats course, you'll cover MCMC but MC is just going to be a tiny part of the course.  \n\nThere are several books that are *only* on Monte Carlo simulations. I have several I got for courses I took in grad school. If you want to learn about it, getting an applied book that's specifically about it is useful.\n\nI don't know what people are talking about on Twitter. Twitter is shit. That said, in general courses don't focus a lot on the presentation of results/prediction/visualization/explanation, and MC is used a lot on that area. Books usually stop once you fit the model, maybe have some basic table, a one summary explanation of the results (and it's usually something like this goes up, this goes down), the end.\n\n### Comment ID j61k284 with +1 score by [(MrAce2C, Reddit, 2023-01-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10ljew2/monte_carlo_simulation/j61k284/) (in reply to ID j6001fc):\nHi!

That's usually in conjunction with a user story mapping process (Jeff Patton), and harks back to how Extreme Programming (XP) worked.   \n  \nAs soon as access to the customer becomes a constraint, you'll tend to slide towards larger \"batch sizes\" and the need for more \"upstream\" product discovery and \"downstream\" UAT and feedback.  \n  \nIn those cases you tend to move from the \"thin slice of value\" model and decompose the \"big\" work into things that are more work-flow or task oriented, based on the \"up front requirements\"   \n  \nIt's not super agile, because the big batch sizes will still tend to mean an \"inspect and rework\" approach to quality (in a \"built the right thing\" sense)   \n  \nHowever it's also not really waterfall, as you will still be doing all the agile \"build the thing right\" stuff around CI/CD, automated testing, agile test quadrants and even stuff like TDD and pairing.\n\nThat said, I'd counsel it's really down to the team in terms of how they want to self-manage the work.  The data they are tracking should help them to locate bottlenecks and continuously improve how they are delivering.  \n  \nIt's also up to the business how they want to control investment risk.  The bigger the batch size, the greater the sunk-costs, and the more you stand to lose if you are wrong about what customers value.  \n  \nIf you have the access to capital that supports the size of bet you are making, then that's okay.

MC simulation achieved better results.\n* One of the most subtle, but best things about moving to something like MC simulation is the introduction of probability into forecasts. You no longer communicate: \"Yeah, we'll be done on Feb 30. We think.\" and move to \"We'll be finished on Feb 30, x% of the time\" where x is your risk tolerance.\n* A lot of people make a big deal about sample set. I found that 10 pieces of cycle time/throughput data was sufficient to start generating results.\n* While small, same sized stories can help, I found you can still use MC simulation without working on story size. What a backlog with same sized stories will do is \"narrow\" the distribution curve of throughput results, which will reduce the impact of risk levels on the forecast. Forecasts with randomly sized stories are still valid, but changes in risk tolerance will produce a wider range of results.\n* Some semblance of control over cycle time, and thus throughput, is more important than story size, imo. But you really shouldn't be saying you're using kanban if you're not controlling WIP.\n* You'll need to prune your data set. Obvious outliers should be thrown away. You probably want a horizon for the data so you're biased towards more recent results. And, of course, fundamental changes to critical things like team composition, etc can render previous forecasts unreliable.\n\n### Comment ID lkk3skz with +3 score by [(mippzon, Reddit, 2024-08-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/agile/comments/1f4akow/you_experience_with_monte_carlo_simulation_in/lkk3skz/) (in reply to ID lkjzn6p):\nThanks for an extensive answer!

I believe it might be a plugin for Jira now??\n* Even with expert Kanban teams, you might find yourself with a story/ticket that gets put on hold due to some emergency, or because someone is sick and there's no one to pick it up, or life just generally intervenes. For example, a ticket might get started before Christmas, just not get finished before the break, and sit there until the new year. Yeah, with enough brain sweat we could have probably come up with a good enough adjusted cycle time, but we just didn't want to bother. One of the things we wanted from the MC approach was just less handling of stories. \n* I'm not sure what you're asking for in terms of variance. Do you mean what's the farthest we've missed a forecast? Or how much the forecast varies based on risk? \n   * If it's the latter, then yeah, some of our forecasts generated with small data sets had great sensitivity to risk level. That's the one advantage of a larger data set and/or smaller stories. \n   * If it's the former, we tended to set quarterly releases to customers, so we'd use a \"How many\" simulation to tell the PO how many stories they could reasonably pick from the product backlog. We were generally within 10% of the forecasted # of stories while velocity wasn't as accurate (plus velocity generally deals with averages, which is essentially a coin toss). \n\nHope that answers your questions.\n\n### Comment ID lkw06s0 with +1 score by [(AskGroundbreaking124, Reddit, 2024-08-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/agile/comments/1f4akow/you_experience_with_monte_carlo_simulation_in/lkw06s0/) (in reply to ID lkjzn6p):\nNice!\n\nSince you mentioned User Story size, I would be very grateful if you could share your view in a situation I have already shared in other comment.\n\nI have just joined a startup that is all into Kanban, using Monte Carlo and stuff but their Work Item is Tasks (like technical ones, frontend, backend and stuff), they jump from epics right to technical tasks, and then all the metrics and simulations a are applied in this task level.\n\nIs does not make any sense to me.\nI believe the right level to estimate, simulate and get metrics would be User Stories, I am right?\n\nIf so, how do the devs breakdown the user stories and track them in the board?\n\nThanks for any advice!\n\n#### Comment ID lkx1w9j with +1 score by [(DingBat99999, Reddit, 2024-09-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/agile/comments/1f4akow/you_experience_with_monte_carlo_simulation_in/lkx1w9j/) (in reply to ID lkw06s0):\nI guess the first question is: Is it working? If so, then why change it?\n\nThe second question is: Where are they measuring throughput? At the epic level? If so, how big are their epics? Is this just a case of different labels?\n\nThere's nothing particularly special about user stories wrt kanban or MC. Any old item will do for throughput. In Scrum we like user value, which is typically only realized when a backlog item is delivered. But user stories themselves are an XP mechanism. \n\nSo long as this team is truly using Kanban properly, is watching for bottlenecks related to the silos, is managing WIP, etc, then there shouldn't be anything wrong with making the level of focus the task on the board. There might be some difficulty tying throughput to value, and I'm not sure how they're using MC for forecasting, but it's not absolutely wrong.\n\n## Comment ID lkswkhp with +2 score by [(sf-keto, Reddit, 2024-08-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/agile/comments/1f4akow/you_experience_with_monte_carlo_simulation_in/lkswkhp/) (in reply to ID 1f4akow):\nMonte Carlo is great for stakeholders, because you can give actual dates at 85-90% levels of service.

I think you need to frame the method in knowing that a huge part of the practical application of mathematics before the 20th century involved manually computing different functions. \n\nHuge reference works of tables were produced of sines and cosines of different angles and the digits of pi to offload computation time for precise calculations. Some mathematicians spent years creating these kinds of tables. It's been argued that some of Newton's discoveries were the probable result of him seeing patterns in the huge numbers of manual computations that he used to do. Yes, even 'serious' people like Newton did this kind of thing.\n\nConceptually, an abacus is analogous to a computer. It's just offloading computation onto a physical process. Disregarding the technical breakthroughs of the transistor and the miniaturization of electronics, a computer is, conceptually, just finding a way to have calculations be done by the universe, through moving electrons around, rather than doing them by hand on a piece of paper. However, just by doing this very simple thing more quickly you are able to create entirely new fields, like computer graphics, that would be unthinkable in a paradigm where calculations have to be done by hand.\n\nSimilarly, the realization that: \"all of these problems that we can't solve analytically, I think we can solve them numerically by setting up a situation where a device will just 'spit out the correct answer'\" was pretty brilliant. Sure, this idea is somewhat obvious once advanced computers are established as an existing thing, but Ulam invented the method in the infancy of computers. Before computers, this kind of approach would have been unthinkable. If your issue is that \"Ulam shouldn't get so much credit because anyone could have come up with the idea once computers became established\" then maybe you're correct. But disregarding the question of credit and just considering the method itself, doesn't it almost send chills down your spine that we can just set up a system correctly and then have it give us the answer to a question that we would have no way of finding out the answer to on our own?\n\n### Comment ID kppannf with +51 score by [(rhubarb_man, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kppannf/) (in reply to ID kpp8ns6):\nI see, thank you.

For example, maybe you want to calculate the integral of a function over a line segment. \n\nOne way of doing this is by using Riemann sums over a grid of  k points on the line segment. Here you would need to evaluate your function k times over the grid. In n dimensions, the same idea would require k\\^n evaluations, so exponentially many in terms of the ambient dimension. \n\nAlternatively, if you can relate the integral to the density of random variable which is easy to sample from, you can save yourself some computational complexity by sampling from the density and using the strong law of large numbers. \n\n[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKnjsqYVG4Y) is an illustrative example I found.\n\n## Comment ID kpp28ga with +5 score by [(jdorje, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kpp28ga/) (in reply to ID 1amy1gh):\nWhat's \"interesting\" about Monte Carlo is that you can apply it to just about anything without knowing any/much deeper (real-world/science) theory or using deep math.    With just a bit of computing power you can get a long way without any real understanding of what you're studying.  It can be a great starting point for approaching a problem.\n\n\nThere is one advantage it may never lose in that its space complexity  is tiny, effectively constant.  While its time complexity is huge, typically exponential, it does lend itself to distributed or ongoing study.  \n\n\nYou can often use more interesting math and problem understanding to get \"better\" MC methods (like flipping toothpicks to approximate pi) or to get an error estimate out of your MC results (getting error bars on your pi toothpick estimate).  But it seems fairly rare that this is better than finding a non-MC solution (this is one of the worst possible ways to approximate pi).\n\n\nIf a better method is available it's usually going to be much better.

Some of these stunning applications come in theory CS, particularly in counting or sampling from a set of combinatorial structures. The MCMC method runs riot here.\n\nOne example which I have directly worked on is the uniform sampling of proper colorings of a graph. Note that the set of all colorings, proper and improper, with k colors of a graph with n vertices is exponentially large. What you want to do however is produce a uniform sample from the set of proper colorings, i.e., colorings which impart two different colors across any edge of the graph. This set is exponentially smaller than the set of all colorings, and it is unstructured. So we have absolutely no clue how to produce a uniform sample from this set other than the Monte Carlo method. \n\nAnother interesting example is sampling independent sets of a graph. Note that usually this is a very hard problem. However, using the MCMC method we discovered that there is a range of parameters for which this sampling is easy, and beyond a certain threshold suddenly becomes hard in the NP hard sense. It turns out this threshold is related to the physics of phase transitions of certain models of magnetism! \n\nOther places where deep insights have been gleaned from this technique is the theory of expanders  which finds use in everything from modelling large networks to error correcting codes. \n\nThere are literally reams of literature dedicated to this line of work in theory CS, each more surprising than the last. \n\nI hope this answer helps somewhat.\n\n## Comment ID kpoxxzt with +3 score by [(CatOfGrey, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kpoxxzt/) (in reply to ID 1amy1gh):\nWhat makes Monte Carlo interesting for me, is that it can be used to model outcomes based on non-standard distributions.\n\nIn my practice, I have done Monte Carlo work with survey data.

Right now, we know general/Newtonian physics and then things get more hairy from there once our object of study becomes smaller. If we precisely knew, or at least the equations of, every possible chemical reactions down to the most granular level of matter, then we can predict everything in theory. \n\nBut even then just knowing the equation does not give the formula for the solutions, let alone existence directly. All the deterministic methods we have, i.e., numerical methods, usually require us to know enough about the equation to make reasonable approximations. However, when we do not even know the equations and all we have is just observations, then the Monte Carlo methods can help us. \n\nIt's not clear from the simple coin toss example but it's evident when you learn just a little bit of Reinforcement Learning.

If you're taking requests, I'd like to see the correlation year over year between splitter swinging strike rate and batter exit velocity of flyball/line drive (for results from all pitches) to help us see if we can better understand when the balls, or more specifically the seams, have been changed.\n\n### Comment ID hshqb4k with +3 score by [(little-chungus40, Reddit, 2022-01-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sabermetrics/comments/s2zno8/monte_carlo_simulation/hshqb4k/) (in reply to ID hshp54i):\nThat is actually something i was not thinking about, but could be very helpful to calculate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo give context, a buddy of mine runs regression models in other sports but also has a lot of history using monte carlo's in electrical engineering. For a sport like baseball, we would like to run a regression model with a monte carlo model, find a sweet spot and bet on some games. So i know I may tweak what this group looks for as we are looking for that sweet spot and just going for overall game results based on our models.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith that said, i feel there are a lot of variables for this, and struggling to not only think of everything, but where to find information for everything.\n\n#### Comment ID hshrjg4 with +2 score by [(Denahom_Chickn, Reddit, 2022-01-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sabermetrics/comments/s2zno8/monte_carlo_simulation/hshrjg4/) (in reply to ID hshqb4k):\nStatcast data on pitch spin rates, velocity, and batted ball data is on baseballsavant.com. Other stats you can compile custom reports on FanGraphs leaderboards. I'm sure baseballreference has a similar tool but I personally use FG. \n\nBetting on games is interesting, I'm interested in what you find out that would be helpful on the single game scale. I love baseball and do lots of season long roto, but daily fantasy and single game betting is tough. I do think your work could be focused on some of the season long prop bets that are put out. Those are where your time may be best spent. I know Bovada has some players every year that get listed as long shots for awards or leading in stat categories that monte carlo might help ID as being more likely to win than their odds.\n\n## Comment ID hshnwus with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-01-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sabermetrics/comments/s2zno8/monte_carlo_simulation/hshnwus/) (in reply to ID s2zno8):\nWeather from baseball reference game logs\nPark factors from fangraphs \n\nAre you simulating daily/game-by-game?\n\nOnly simulate stats that cannot be generated from other stats.

Looking to simulate day by day/game by game - keeping tracking of our info.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf we got good enough on carlo and regression model that we find a sweet spot to bet on games, we would likely do that.

I think the hint here is:\n\n> I want to take the mean of the wing angle **with respect to time**\n\nbut there isn't any other information given regarding what that actually means. OP goes on to state,\n\n> I would like the 3 sigma bounds to be created from the actual data. \n\nBut again, no information here regarding what an input is, what an output is, what the \"data\" is, etc. \n\nIf I had to guess, I would imagine OP has some other criteria, like flight duration, that's a function of wing angle, and OP is wanting to \"score\" wing angles by flight time, or something like that, as in:\n\n    wingAngles = linspace(90, 45, 100);\n    flightTimes = FlyPlane(wingAngles);\n\nThat's a guess, though. I tried to give as much as I could in my post, as directly as I could, based on strictly what was given.

I imagine he's going to want to look at something like \"wing displacement across multiple angles\" where the wing is extending out across the 45 to 90 range, and there is some amount of external influence that could be altering the displacement (like the difference between the set point and the actual value in a control theory type class, or an external wind that is randomly generated in a modeling class).\n\n#### Comment ID dui7466 with +1 score by [(EZaces, Reddit, 2018-02-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/7ymbav/3_sigma_confidence_bounds/dui7466/) (in reply to ID duhwc6n):\n/u/shtpst your response covered most of my issue. So thank you for the response. What I am struggling with is the time variance throughout the monte carlo data: \n\nwingAngles = [90 90 90 90 90 90 85 80 75 75 75 75 75 75 70 65 60 55 50 45 45 45;\n             90 90 90 85 80 75 75 75 75 65 60 55 50 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45; \n             90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 85 80 75 75 75 75 70 65 60 55 50 45 45 45;]; \n         \ntimes = [0:0.1:2.1; 0.1:0.1:2.2; 0.4:0.1:2.5]; \n\nAs you can see all though the data has the same length of time the first data point in each time array varies (0, 0.1, 0.4). The angles themselves also vary in duration at each angle stage (90, 75, and 45) because of this if I simply take the mean of each array I get a straight line with a relatively constant slope rather than a mean that should will show the mean time the wings are at 90 constant slope to 75 mean time at 75 and a constant slope to 45. I hope this makes sense. It is difficult to explain.",

I'll be attending the Tableau Conference in San Diego soon, and it's not only my first time at this particular conference but my first conference ever.\n\nI'm not sure what to expect. Would it be wise to bring my laptop, or is that unnecessary? Besides the main sessions, are there other activities or events I should make sure to attend?\n\nAlso, since I'm going solo, I'm eager to meet new people and deepen my knowledge of Tableau. How approachable are people typically at these events? I'm attending as a practitioner with the aim to make connections and enhance my understanding of the tool. Any tips on ways to meet folks at the conference? Are there specific times or places that are good for meeting people?\n\nAre there any must-see sessions or speakers that you would recommend for someone who's been using Tableau for a few years now? Also I've been seeing a lot of stuff about swag. Are there any items that I should definitely look out for or pick up while I'm there? Oh and are there resources or communities I should join to stay connected and continue learning after the conference ends?\n\nAny advice, recommendations, or personal experiences would be incredibly helpful.

Monte Carlo focuses on what matters rather than what they think should matter based on some YC blog they read.\n2. Monte Carlo actually has a natural work-life balance because 1) they can avoid burnout this way and 2) most folks have kids at home. This means no Sunday 11pm emails, no calls scheduled after 6pm, etc. \n3. Monte Carlo is obsessed with solving a HUGE problem with a monumental TAM (Snowflake-sized) because anyone that uses a cloud-based data warehouse has a problem trusting their data. \n\nAs a result, Monte Carlo can provide best-in-class benefits (because we've raised a lot of VC from best-in-class investors), hire the best people, and work with the most data-first companies in the ecosystem. Creating and owning a new category that other companies like Datadog (market cap of $35B) and Snowflake (market cap of $80B) will eventually step into is also very satisfying. \n\nFinally, having a woman as CEO that is not some 25 year old wunderkid out of Stanford/MIT/Harvard means diversity, equity, and inclusion starts at the top. We can recruit some of the best talent (1:1 female to male ratio currently) because our culture is actually inclusive and not full of 26 year old white guys from SoMa/The Marina.",

Monte Carlo focuses on what matters rather than what they think should matter based on some YC blog they read.\n2. Monte Carlo actually has a natural work-life balance because 1) they can avoid burnout this way and 2) most folks have kids at home. This means no Sunday 11pm emails, no calls scheduled after 6pm, etc. \n3. Monte Carlo is obsessed with solving a HUGE problem with a monumental TAM (Snowflake-sized) because anyone that uses a cloud-based data warehouse has a problem trusting their data. \n\nAs a result, Monte Carlo can provide best-in-class benefits (because we've raised a lot of VC from best-in-class investors), hire the best people, and work with the most data-first companies in the ecosystem. Creating and owning a new category that other companies like Datadog (market cap of $35B) and Snowflake (market cap of $80B) will eventually step into is also very satisfying. \n\nFinally, having a woman as CEO that is not some 25 year old wunderkid out of Stanford/MIT/Harvard means diversity, equity, and inclusion starts at the top. We can recruit some of the best talent (1:1 female to male ratio currently) because our culture is actually inclusive and not full of 26 year old white guys from SoMa/The Marina.",

      "# [What Is Data Observability? 5 Key Pillars To Know In 2024 by Barr Moses, Barr Moses CEO, Co-founder, action movies on 2024-03-01](https://www.montecarlodata.com/blog-what-is-data-observability/)\nEditor’s Note: So much has happened since we first published this post and created the data observability category and Monte Carlo in 2019. We have updated this post to reflect this rapidly maturing space. You can read the original article linked at the bottom of this page.\n\nWhat is Data Observability?\n\nI coined the term data observability in 2019. Here is how I define it today:\n\nData observability provides full visibility into the health of your data AND data systems so you are the first to know when the data is wrong, what broke, and how to fix it.\n\nThe solutions in this category feature machine learning anomaly detection, accelerated root cause analysis capabilities, and end-to-end data lineage. This approach results in healthier data pipelines, increased team productivity, enhanced data management practices, and ultimately, higher customer satisfaction.\n\nThe five pillars of data observability are:\n\nFreshness\n\nQuality\n\nVolume\n\nSchema\n\nLineage\n\nTogether, these components provide valuable insight into the quality and reliability of your data.\n\nIn this post, I’ll dive into these concepts in more detail, including what data observability is, what data observability isn’t, who it’s for, and how to choose the right data observability solution for your platform.\n\nLet’s jump in.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe origins of data observability\n\nI started thinking about the concept that I would later label “data observability” when I was serving as the former VP of Customer Success Operations at Gainsight.\n\nTime and again, we’d deliver a report, only to be notified minutes later about issues with our data. It didn’t matter how strong our ETL pipelines were or how many times we reviewed our SQL: our data just wasn’t reliable.\n\nUnfortunately, this problem wasn’t unique. After speaking with hundreds of data leaders about their biggest pain points, I learned that data downtime tops the list.\n\nData downtime — periods of time when data is partial, erroneous, missing, or otherwise inaccurate — only multiplies as data systems become increasingly complex, supporting an endless ecosystem of sources and consumers.\n\nMuch in the same way DevOps applies observability to software, I thought it was time data teams leveraged this same blanket of diligence and began creating the category of data observability as a more holistic way to approach data quality.\n\nAnd along with defining the category, I defined 5 key pillars that define data observability to this day.\n\nWhat are the five pillars of data observability?\n\n“Observability” is a concept many data leaders are probably familiar with from DevOps, but when it comes to data, what is it that we’re actually observing?\n\nNow, let’s take a look at each of these five pillars in a bit more detail.\n\nFreshness\n\nFreshness seeks to understand how up-to-date your data tables are, as well as the cadence at which your tables are updated. Freshness is particularly important when it comes to decision making; after all, stale data is basically synonymous with wasted time and money.\n\nQuality\n\nYour data pipelines might be in working order but the data flowing through them could be garbage. The quality pillar looks at the data itself and aspects such as percent NULLS, percent uniques and if your data is within an accepted range. Quality gives you insight into whether or not your tables can be trusted based on what can be expected from your data.\n\nVolume\n\nVolume refers to the completeness of your data tables and offers insights on the health of your data sources. If 200 million rows suddenly turns into 5 million, you should know.\n\nSchema\n\nChanges in the organization of your data, in other words, schema, often indicates broken data. Monitoring who makes changes to these tables and when is foundational to understanding the health of your data ecosystem.\n\nLineage\n\nWhen data breaks, the first question is always “where?” Data lineage provides the answer by telling you which upstream sources and downstream ingestors were impacted, as well as which teams are generating the data and who is accessing it. Good lineage also collects information about the data (also referred to as metadata) that speaks to governance, business, and technical guidelines associated with specific data tables, serving as a single source of truth for all consumers.\n\nWhy is data observability important?\n\nData observability is important for two reasons. For data engineers (and developers), data observability is important because data downtime means wasted time and resources; for data consumers, it’s equally as important because it erodes confidence in decision making.\n\nIn that sense, the value of data pipeline monitoring and data observability is near priceless. That being said, it’s unlikely the chief financial officer is going to accept “priceless” when you are building your business case. So let’s take a look at how data teams have measured data quality.\n\nA simple calculation for the estimated number of incidents you have each year (whether you are currently catching them or not) can be done by dividing the number of tables you have in your environment by 15.\n\nYou can then multiply this number by your average time-to-detection and average time-to-resolution. If you aren’t currently capturing these metrics, don’t worry, you are not alone.\n\nOur industry research revealed the industry average is about 4 hours and 9 hours respectively–feel free to use or adjust those estimates based on your organization’s data quality maturity.\n\nCongratulations, you have just calculated your data downtime! Now let’s calculate its cost, and thus the value of a data observability solution.\n\nThe first part of the calculation, labor cost, is relatively straightforward. Since we know data quality professionals spend around 40% of their time on inefficient data quality practices, we can use this formula:\n\nTotal data engineers x 1804 (average working hours in a year) x $62 (average salary) x .4\n\nThe operational cost of poor data quality is a bit harder to quantify. A data incident can be as harmless as a broken dashboard no one uses or as painful as reporting incorrect numbers to Wall Street.\n\nOne way to estimate this is to measure the overall risk. If an organization invests in its data team to increase overall efficiency 10% (or insert your own value here) then for each hour of data downtime we can assume the organization’s productivity has been reduced 10%. The formula is then:\n\nOverall data downtime x % reduction in hourly revenue generated.\n\nWe put together a data observability value calculator to help.\n\nData observability is as essential to DataOps as observability is to DevOps\n\nAs organizations grow and the underlying tech stacks powering them become more complicated (think: moving from a monolith to a microservices architecture), it became important for DevOps teams within the software engineering department to maintain a constant pulse on the health of their systems and deploy continuous integration and development (CI/CD) approaches.\n\nObservability, a more recent addition to the software engineering lexicon, speaks to this need, and refers to the monitoring, tracking, and triaging of incidents to prevent software application downtime.\n\nAt its core, there are three pillars of observability data :\n\nMetrics refer to a numeric representation of data measured over time.\n\nLogs, a record of an event that took place at a given timestamp, also provide valuable context regarding when a specific event occurred.\n\nTraces represent causally related events in a distributed environment.\n\n(For a more detailed description of these, I highly recommend reading Cindy Sridharan’s landmark post, Monitoring and Observability).\n\nTaken together, these three pillars and application management (APM) solutions like DataDog or Splunk, gave DevOps teams and software engineers valuable awareness and insights to predict future behavior, and in turn, trust their IT systems to meet SLAs.\n\nData engineering teams needed similar processes and tools to monitor their ETL (or ELT) pipelines and prevent data downtime across their data systems. Enter data observability.\n\nFor data engineers and developers, data observability is important because data downtime means wasted time and resources; for data consumers, it erodes confidence in your decision making.\n\nEvaluation criteria can be tricky when you may not even have a strong answer to the basic question, “what are data observability tools?” You can see what analysts have used as data observability criteria as well a a sample RFP, but in short a great data observability platform has the following features:\n\nIt connects to your existing stack quickly and seamlessly and does not require modifying your data pipelines, writing new code, or using a particular programming language. This allows quick time to value and maximum testing coverage without having to make substantial investments.\n\nIt monitors your data at-rest and does not require extracting the data from where it is currently stored. This allows the data observability solution to be performant, scalable and cost-efficient. It also ensures that you meet the highest levels of security and compliance requirements.\n\nIt requires minimal configuration and practically no threshold-setting. Data observability tools should use machine learning models to automatically learn your environment and your data. It uses anomaly detection techniques to let you know when things break. It minimizes false positives by taking into account not just individual metrics, but a holistic view of your data and the potential impact from any particular issue. You do not need to spend resources configuring and maintaining noisy rules within your data observability platform.\n\nIt requires no prior mapping of what needs to be monitored and in what way. It helps you identify key resources, key dependencies and key invariants so that you get broad data observability with little effort.\n\nIt provides rich context that enables rapid triage and troubleshooting, and effective communication with stakeholders impacted by data reliability issues. Data observability tools shouldn’t stop at “field X in table Y has values lower than Z today.”\n\nIt prevents issues from happening in the first place by exposing rich information about data assets so that changes and modifications can be made responsibly and proactively.\n\nData observability vs. data testing\n\nSimilar to how software engineers use unit tests to identify buggy code before it’s pushed to production, data engineers often leverage tests to detect and prevent potential data quality issues from moving further downstream.\n\nThis approach was (mostly) fine until companies began ingesting so much data that a single point of failure just wasn’t feasible.\n\nI’ve encountered countless data teams that suffer consistent data quality issues despite a rigorous testing regime. It’s deflating and a bad use of your engineers’ time.\n\nThe reason even the best testing processes are insufficient is because there are two types of data quality issues: those you can predict (known unknowns) and those you can’t (unknown unknowns).\n\nSome teams will have hundreds(!) of tests in place to cover most known unknowns but they don’t have an effective way to cover unknown unknowns.\n\nSome examples of unknown unknowns covered by data observability include:\n\nA Looker dashboard or report that is not updating, and the stale data goes unnoticed for several months—until a business executive goes to access it for the end of the quarter and notices the data is wrong.\n\nA small change to your organization’s codebase that causes an API to stop collecting data that powers a critical field in your Tableau dashboard.\n\nAn accidental change to your JSON schema that turns 50,000 rows into 500,000 overnight.\n\nAn unintended change happens to your ETL, ELT or reverse ETL that causes some tests not to run, leading to data quality issues that go unnoticed for a few days.\n\nA test that has been a part of your pipelines for years but has not been updated recently to reflect the current business logic.\n\nIn a Medium article, Vimeo Senior Data Engineer Gilboa Reif describes how using data observability and dimension monitors at scale help address the unknown unknowns gap that open source and transformation tools leave open.\n\nChoozle CTO Adam Woods says data observability gives his team a deeper insight than manual testing or monitoring could provide.\n\nTo summarize, data observability is different and more effective than testing because it provides end-to-end coverage, is scalable, and has lineage that helps with impact analysis.\n\nData observability vs. data monitoring\n\nData pipeline monitoring involves using machine learning to understand the way your data pipelines typically behave, and then send alerts when anomalies occur in that behavior (see the 5 pillars).\n\nSome tools within the modern data stack, like Airflow for instance, will have the ability to monitor their portion of the ETL pipeline. While helpful, data teams need to monitor their entire pipeline end-to-end from ingestion to landing and through transformation all the way to consumption in the BI layer.\n\nIt is also important that data pipeline monitoring is supplemented with a process for monitoring the data quality itself. This is because while the pipeline may be operating fine, the data flowing through it may be garbage.\n\nFor example, the data values may be outside the normal historical range or there could be anomalies present in the NULL rates or percent uniques. Monitoring the data itself can be done automatically with machine learning as well as by setting custom rules, for example if you know a monetary conversion rate can never be negative.\n\nWhen automated data monitoring is combined with features to accelerate incident resolution, understand the impact of those incidents, and illustrate data health over time, it then becomes data observability.\n\nData observability vs data quality\n\nData observability enables and improves data quality. Data quality is often expressed in the six dimensions of accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, validity, and uniqueness.\n\nI’ve found that among business stakeholders, the reality is data quality is considered a binary metric. Your CFO doesn’t come up to you and say, “the data was accurate but out of date so I’m considering it to be of average quality.”\n\nThose other data quality metrics are helpful for data professionals to understand what’s not working and where to focus their resources, but for your data consumers either the data quality is good or it’s bad. Just like a SaaS solution, either it’s working or it’s not. That’s why we created the metric of data downtime.\n\nWith a data observability solution in place, data teams can ensure they have high data quality.\n\nData quality vs data reliability\n\nThese terms are often used interchangeably, which is fine. However, another way to think about it is that solving for data quality requires you to think beyond a point in time, and consider how the quality changes over time in a variety of real-world conditions.\n\nThat is true data reliability.\n\nFor example, the quality of an airline might be measured based on its timeliness (percent of flights on-time), safety (major incidents) and food service approximating that of a diner.\n\nBut in order for the airline to be reliable, it’s expected to maintain those levels of quality consistently over time, across various routes, weather conditions and holiday weekends.\n\nSimilarly, a data product’s quality might be assessed by its availability at 9am, the completeness of records, and its consistency versus a source-of-record. For it to be reliable, you must assess whether it maintains these service levels over time, across holiday traffic spikes and product launches.\n\nIn solving for reliability you must not simply measure data quality (at a point in time and space), but also establish expected levels of quality and service (i.e. how quickly you’ll communicate and respond to incidents), and have the toolkit to rapidly diagnose and resolve data incidents.\n\nData observability vs data reliability engineering\n\nSome data observability companies have started to describe themselves or their tools in the framework of data reliability engineering.\n\nThis makes sense as data observability borrows heavily from observability and other concepts of site reliability engineering (SRE). While different solutions or tools may have significant differences in features offered, there is no real difference between data observability and data reliability engineering.\n\nBoth terms are focused on the practice of ensuring healthy, high quality data across an organization.\n\nSigns you need a data observability platform\n\nThis 2019 talk helped introduced data downtime and data observability. It is still relevant today.\n\nFrom speaking with hundreds of customers over the years, I have identified seven telltale signs that suggest your data team should prioritize data quality.\n\nThey are:\n\nYou’re data platform has recently migrated to cloud\n\nYour data stack is scaling with more data sources, more tables, and more complexity\n\nYour data team is growing\n\nYour team is spending at least 30% of their time firefighting data quality issues\n\nYour team has more data consumers than you did 1 year ago\n\nYour company is moving to a self-service analytics model\n\nData is a key part of the customer value proposition\n\nThe future of data observability\n\nData observability is a rapidly maturing but still evolving space. For example, G2 Crowd created a data observability category in late 2022, but as of this writing there is not a data observability Gartner Magic Quadrant. That being said, Gartner did place data observability on their 2022 Data Management Hype Cycle.\n\nHowever, multiple companies and technologies are identifying with the term data observability. There has been tremendous investor activity, and, most importantly, customer interest and values are at all-time highs.\n\nData observability is at the heart of the modern data stack, whether it’s enabling more self-service analytics and data team collaboration, adoption, or working alongside dbt unit tests and Airflow circuit breakers to prevent bad data from entering the data warehouse (or data lake) in the first place. It is also a core component of important and emerging data quality best practices such as data mesh, data SLAs, and data contracts.\n\nI see a bright future for data observability as data continues its march from dusty dashboards to the boardroom, machine learning models, operational systems, customer facing products, and more.\n\nWith data observability, data quality and data engineering are finally getting a seat at the table.\n\n[The original article that launched a category: What is data observability?

      "# [The Ultimate Guide To Data Lineage by Glen Willis on 2024-07-08](https://www.montecarlodata.com/blog-data-lineage/)\nData lineage is a metadata map that traces the relationship between upstream and downstream dependencies in your data pipelines to illustrate where your data comes from, how it changes, and where it’s surfaced to end users.\n\nLet’s take a look at what enterprise data lineage is in practice and how it supports your data quality.\n\nWhat is Data Lineage?\n\nIn layman’s terms, data lineage is all about mapping: where your data comes from, how it changes as it moves throughout your pipelines, and where it’s surfaced to your end consumers. When done right, data lineage can be a super power for your data engineering teams.\n\nSometimes confused with data mapping, which is the process of combing data fields across models, data lineage instead provides a visualization of how the data moves within an environment.\n\nEnterprise data lineage solutions help data teams:\n\nUnderstand how changes to specific assets will impact downstream dependencies, so they don’t have to work blindly and risk unwelcome surprises for unknown stakeholders.\n\nTroubleshoot the root cause of data issues faster when they do occur by making it easy to see at-a-glance what upstream errors may have caused a report to break.\n\nCommunicate the impact of broken data to consumers who rely on downstream reports and tables—proactively keeping them in the loop when data may be inaccurate and notifying them when any issues have been resolved.\n\nThe data lineage life cycle shows at-a-glance how data is collected and activated to help data teams understand and monitor upstream and downstream dependencies. While data lineage isn’t new to the modern data stack, in the old days (say the mid-2010s or so), enterprise lineage was still an aggressively manual process.\n\nProducing data lineage required identifying your data assets, tracking those assets from ingestion sources, documenting all those sources, mapping the path of data as it moved through various pipelines and transforms, and finally pinpointing where the data was being served up in dashboards and reports.\n\nIn its manual form, lineage was a burden at the best of times. But as data stacks grew more complex, lineage maps became nearly impossible to maintain. These days, thanks to the introduction of automated column level data lineage tooling, mapping dependencies across pipelines has become accessible for the first time.\n\nWhat are the two types of data lineage?\n\nData lineage comes in two primary forms; table-level lineage and column-level lineage (also known as field-level lineage).\n\nTable-level lineage is the simplest and most common form of data lineage, and it illustrates how various tables within a data environment relate to one another. While this can be helpful to understand how a given table has been formed, it can’t tell you about about the origin of the data within the table.\n\nColumn-level data lineage on the other hand is a map of a dataset’s path from ingestion to visualization. Column-level lineage is an essential component of Data Observability because it empowers data engineers to quickly trace the root cause of a data quality incident back to its source and conduct impact analysis to discover what downstream dependencies might be affected.\n\nWhat’s the difference between data lineage and traceability?\n\nWhile both data lineage and traceability are concerned with tracing the origins of data, these two practices differ in their overall purpose and audience.\n\nData lineage, which tends to be very technical is concerned primarily with supporting pipeline optimization and root-cause analysis through a detailed map of how data is ingested, transformed, and activated across a data environment. Traceability, on the other hand, tends to serve the specific needs of a given business domain, and it primarily concerned with validating the origins and accuracy of information for compliance and usage insights.\n\nWhile traceability can be leveraged by any team depending on it’s needs, data lineage is often only useful for technical users like data product managers and platform engineers.\n\nWhy is Data Lineage Important?\n\nData lineage is the key to efficient incident resolution. By understanding the upstream and downstream dependencies of our tables, we can more quickly understand the impact, notify stakeholders, and remediate data data breaks should an incident arise.\n\nMachine learning has enabled vendors to offer data lineage at scale in a way that was previously impossible through manual processes. And that’s a good thing.\n\nBut just because something is easier doesn’t mean it’s always better.\n\nEven with a proliferation of new tooling, if data lineage isn’t handled carefully, it’s unlikely to be much more than eye candy. And unfortunately, some new approaches to data lineage focus more on attractive graphs than compiling a rich, useful map.\n\nUnlike the end-to-end lineage achieved through data observability, these surface-level approaches don’t provide the robust functionality and comprehensive, field-level coverage required to deliver on the value promise of data lineage.\n\nIs data lineage necessary for every data team?\n\nThe short answer is yes. If you are a data team who plans to take data reliability seriously and scale your data quality practice, data lineage is an essential tool in your data quality tool belt.\n\nWhile some data teams with relatively small environments can survive by manually parsing data whenever a data anomaly gets flagged, that will only work for as long as that data remains small. Manually tracing the lineage of 5 tables with 7 data sources isn’t the same as manually tracing the lineage of 100 tables across 50 data sources for assets that are being consumed by 5 different domain teams.\n\nEnterprise data lineage enables teams to scale data quality, and provides enterprise data teams with the resources they need to effectively resolve data quality incidents and reduce the impact of data downtime. Data lineage can also communicate the impact radius of a given data quality incident, so you understand what data assets have been effected, who’s using them, and what to keep an eye on as you begin the incident manage process.\n\nWithout data lineage, growing data teams are fighting data quality fires with their hands behind their backs.\n\nLet’s explore five things your data team can do today to get more value from your data lineage—and where modern data lineage gets it wrong.\n\n5 Ways to Get More Value From Data Lineage\n\n1. Focus on quality over quantity through lineage\n\nModern companies are hungry to become data-driven, but collecting more data isn’t always what’s best for the business. Data that isn’t relevant or useful for analytics can just become noise. Amassing the biggest troves of data doesn’t automatically translate to more value—but it does guarantee higher storage and maintenance costs.\n\nThat’s why big data is getting smaller. Gartner predicts that 70% of organizations will shift their focus from big data to small and wide data over the next few years, adopting an approach that reduces dependencies while facilitating more powerful analytics and AI.\n\nLineage should play a key role in these decisions. Rather than simply using automation to capture and produce surface-level graphs of data, lineage solutions should include pertinent information such as which assets are being used and by whom. With this fuller picture of data usage, teams can begin to get a better understanding of what data is most valuable to their organization. Outdated tables or assets that are no longer being used can be deprecated to avoid potential issues and confusion downstream, and help the business focus on data quality over quantity.\n\n2. Surface what matters through field-level data lineage\n\nPetr Janda recently published an article about how data teams need to treat lineage more like maps—specifically, like Google Maps. He argues that lineage solutions should be able to facilitate a query to find what you’re looking for, rather than relying on complex visuals that are difficult to navigate through.\n\nFor example, you should be able to look for a grocery store when you need a grocery store, without your view being cluttered by the surrounding coffee shops and gas stations that you don’t actually care about. “In today’s tools, data lineage potential is untapped,” Petr writes. “Except for a few filters, the lineage experiences are not designed to find things; they are designed to show things. That’s a big difference.”\n\nWe couldn’t agree more. Data teams don’t need to see everything about their data—they need to be able to find what matters to solve a problem or answer a question.\n\nThis is why field-level lineage is essential. While table-level lineage has been the norm for several years, when data engineers want to understand exactly why or how their pipelines break, they need more granularity. Field-level lineage helps teams zero in on the impact of specific code, operational, and data changes on downstream fields and reports.\n\nWhen data breaks, field-level lineage can surface the most critical and widely used downstream reports that are impacted. And that same lineage reduces time-to-resolution by allowing data teams to quickly trace back to the root cause of data issues.\n\n3. Organize data lineage for clearer interpretation\n\nData lineage can follow in the footsteps of Google Maps in another way: by making it easy and clear to interpret the structure and symbols used in lineage.\n\nJust as Google Maps uses consistent icons and colors to indicate types of businesses (like gas stations and grocery stores), data lineage solutions should apply clear naming conventions and colors for the data it’s describing, down to the logos used for the different tools that make up our data pipelines.\n\nAs data systems grow increasingly complex, organizing lineage for clear interpretation will help teams get the most value out of their lineage as quickly as possible.\n\n4. Include the right context in data lineage\n\nWhile amassing more data for data’s sake may not help meet your business needs, collecting and organizing more metadata—with the right business context—is probably a good idea. Data lineage that includes rich, contextual metadata is incredibly useful because it helps teams troubleshoot faster and understand how potential schema changes will affect downstream reports and stakeholders.\n\nWith the right metadata for a given data asset included in the lineage itself, you can get the answers you need to make informed decisions:\n\nWho owns this data asset?\n\nWhere does this asset live?\n\nWhat data does it contain?\n\nIs it relevant and important to stakeholders?\n\nWho is relying on this asset when I’m making a change to it?\n\nWhen this kind of contextual information about how data assets are used within your business is surfaced and searchable through robust data lineage, incident management becomes easier. You can resolve data downtime faster, and communicate the status of impacted data assets to the relevant stakeholders in your organization.\n\n5. Scale data lineage to meet the needs of the business\n\nUltimately, enterprise data lineage has to be rich, useful, and scaleable in order to be valuable. Otherwise, it’s just eye candy that looks nice in executive presentations but doesn’t do much to actually help teams prevent data incidents or resolve them faster when they do occur.\n\nWe mentioned earlier that lineage has become the hot new layer in the data stack because of automation. And it’s true that automation solves half of this problem: it can help lineage scale to accommodate new data sources, new pipelines, and more complex transformations.\n\nThe other half? Making lineage useful by integrating metadata about all your data assets and pipelines in one cohesive view.\n\nAgain, consider maps. A map isn’t useful if it only shows a portion of what exists in the real world. Without comprehensive coverage, you can’t rely on a map to find everything you need or to navigate from point A to point B. The same is true for data lineage.\n\nEnterprise data lineage solutions must scale through automation without skimping on coverage. Every ingestor, every pipeline, every layer of the stack, and every report must be accounted for, down to the field level—while being rich and discoverable so teams can find exactly what they’re looking for, with a clear organization that makes information easy to interpret, and the right contextual metadata to help teams make swift decisions.\n\nLike we said: lineage is challenging. But when done right, it’s also incredibly powerful.\n\nIf you’re just getting started with data lineage, you might be curious what open-source data lineage tools are available. Unsurprisingly, open source tooling is a go-to for many budget-conscious teams. While this approach certainly has its drawbacks (which we’ll get to in a minute), there are definitely a few open source tools that might be up to the challenge—at least for a little while.\n\nSome of the top open source data data lineage tools include:\n\nOpenMetadata: OpenMetadata is an accessible lineage solution that’s designed to enable coding-limited users to easily create a lineage map without sacrificing the granularity data professionals need to understand complex data transformations.\n\nOpen Lineage + Marquez: OpenLineage isn’t technically a tool, but it’s an open standard for metadata and data lineage collection that recommends the open-source tool Marquez to collect, aggregate and visualize metadata for lineage. Marquez itself offers a relatively user-friendly UI that’s easy to understand and provides a robust API that can be integrated with a variety of data sources and tools to help automate key tasks like backfills and root cause analysis.\n\nEgeria: This one also isn’t a tool, but it provides open APIs, event formats, types, and integration logic to enable metadata features that make it useful for managing data lineage.\n\nApache Atlas: While it bills itself as an open-source metadata management and governance tool, Apache Atlas can be used to track and manage data lineage. Atlas’ UI allows you to view the lineage of data as it moves through various processes and there is a set of REST APIs that allow you to access and update data lineage information.\n\nSpline: An Apache Spark project that was expanded to accommodate data lineage for other data sources. Spline offers APIs to both collect and query data lineage data. Spline supports an OpenLineage integration and it also provides a web UI to display stored lineage information and view lineage in different levels of detail.\n\nJust keep in mind that while there are several options available in the realm of open-source data lineage tools, implementation can definitely be a challenge. An open-source solution might be a good compromise to get you started on a budget, but you’re likely to run into some pretty severe bottlenecks as your needs—and your platform—continues to grow.\n\nWhen that time comes, you’ll probably be better off looking at something like a data observability solution that programmatically marries lineage and monitoring to better support the detection, resolution, and prevention of your data quality issues in a more holistic way.\n\nBottom line: if enterprise data lineage isn’t useful, it doesn’t matter\n\nEven though it seems like data lineage is everywhere right now, keep in mind that we’re also in the early days of automated data lineage. Data lineage tools--whether Collibra, Informatica, Amundsen, Octopai, Monte Carlo, or others--will continue to be refined and improved, and as long as you’re armed with the knowledge of what high-quality lineage should look like, it will be exciting to see where the industry is headed.\n\nOur hope? The category will become less about attractive data lineage graphs and more about powerful functionality, like the next Google Maps.\n\nWant to see the power of data lineage in action?

      "# [All About ETL Testing: Checklist, Tools, and 4 Useful SQL Queries by Lindsay MacDonald on 2024-08-19](https://www.montecarlodata.com/blog-all-about-etl-testing-checklist/)\nETL (extract, transform, and load) testing is essentially the data world’s version of a highly rigorous proofreading session.\n\nImagine if The Wall Street Journal published articles without a final read-through. There might be typos, the facts might be jumbled, or worse, the entire argument could be upside down. So they have editors that scrutinize every word.\n\nJust as a news editor ensures the clarity and accuracy of an article before it hits your screen, ETL testing is the unsung hero ensuring the data your business relies on is spot-on.\n\nETL testing aims to ensure that the data loaded into a target system is accurate, complete, and consistent, and that it adheres to quality standards.\n\nWhen is ETL testing needed?\n\nReally, any time an E, T, or L occurs you should do ETL testing. Some common scenarios are:\n\nData Warehousing Projects: Any time data from multiple sources is consolidated for reporting and analytics purposes.\n\nData Migration Projects: Make sure the data is migrated accurately without any loss or corruption.\n\nBusiness Intelligence (BI) Projects: Accurate and timely data is required for analysis and decision-making.\n\nData Integration Projects: In projects where data from different sources needs to be integrated, ETL testing ensures that the integrated data is consistent and accurate.\n\nRegulatory Compliance: In industries like healthcare and finance, regulatory compliance mandates accurate and complete data reporting.\n\nData Quality Assurance: Identify and rectify data quality issues like duplicate records, missing values, and inconsistencies in data.\n\nETL testing checklist\n\nHere are the essential aspects of each ETL phase:\n\nExtract\n\n🔲 Data extraction logic matches the specified requirements?\n\n🔲 Correct data is pulled from the source?\n\n🔲 No data loss?\n\nTransform\n\n🔲 Data transformation rules are applied?\n\n🔲 Special characters and data types are handled correctly?\n\n🔲 No corruption or unintended changes?\n\nLoad\n\n🔲 Logging is in place to capture failures?\n\n🔲 All data is loaded into the target system?\n\n🔲 No duplicates, nulls, or other data quality errors?\n\n🔲 Consistency across data fields and records?\n\n🔲 Compliance with all relevant data governance and security policies?\n\n🔲 Meets business requirements and user expectations?\n\nGeneral\n\n🔲 Security checked for data at rest and in transit?\n\n🔲 Scalability tests to ensure the system can handle increased data volumes?\n\nPopular SQL queries for ETL testing\n\nWith its many functions and operators, SQL is an indispensable tool to interact directly with the data in its native environment so you can validate and verify it. Here are some example SQL queries for different types of ETL testing scenarios:\n\n1. Test Data Completeness\n\nTo check if all the records from the source system are loaded into the target system, you might use a simple count query on both systems and compare the results:\n\n-- Count records in the source table SELECT COUNT(*) as source_count FROM source_table; -- Count records in the target table SELECT COUNT(*) as target_count FROM target_table;\n\n2.Test Data Transformation Rules\n\nTo validate that the transformation rules have been applied correctly, you can write queries that reflect these rules and compare the output against expected results. Suppose a rule states that all emails in the customer data should be converted to lowercase:\n\n-- Check if email addresses are transformed to lowercase SELECT email FROM target_table WHERE BINARY email != LOWER(email);\n\nThis query selects any email from the target table that does not match its lowercase version, shining light on an issue with the transformation rule.\n\n3. Test Data Quality\n\nFor example you can check for null values, duplicates, or correct data ranges. Here’s how you might check for null values in mandatory fields:\n\n-- Check for NULL values in a mandatory column SELECT COUNT(*) FROM target_table WHERE mandatory_column IS NULL; To check for duplicate records: -- Check for duplicate records based on a unique identifier SELECT unique_identifier, COUNT(*) FROM target_table GROUP BY unique_identifier HAVING COUNT(*) > 1; ​-- Check that data falls within acceptable ranges SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE numeric_column < lower_bound OR numeric_column > upper_bound;\n\n4. Test Data Integration\n\nTo verify that data from different sources has been integrated correctly, you might need to compare key fields that should be consistent across the tables:\n\n-- Compare data across two tables SELECT a.key_field, b.key_field FROM table_a a JOIN table_b b ON a.key_field = b.key_field WHERE a.other_field != b.other_field;\n\nUse the right tool for the job\n\nWhile you can cobble together ETL testing automations in SQL or Python, sophisticated ETL scenarios call for more specialized tools.\n\nFor exotic stuff like non-relational databases, streaming data, or just messy, unformatted data – especially if your job involves the financial and operational backbone of major enterprises – a better way to find and fix bad data fast is data observability platform like Monte Carlo.\n\nMonte Carlo offers a full suite of tools to help you gain full visibility into your data, systems, and code. It’s ETL testing and much more.\n\n✓ Automated machine learning monitors\n\n✓ Integrated data lineage\n\n✓ Comprehensive root cause analysis\n\n✓ Data quality dashboards\n\n✓ Incident alerts\n\n✓ Integrations with all the tools you use\n\nThe dynamic nature of modern ETL processes demands a more robust toolkit.

      "# [Snowflake Summit 2024 Keynote Recap: The Era of Enterprise AI by Michael Segner, data quality, data teams on 2024-06-04](https://www.montecarlodata.com/snowflake-summit-2024-keynote-recap-the-era-of-enterprise-ai/)\nWe’re covering the Snowflake Summit conference keynote for the third straight year (check out our 2022 and 2023 recaps). For Snowflake Summit 2024, festivities have moved from the Las Vegas desert to the San Francisco bay—and with its return to the tech capital came a whole list of buzzy new announcements.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSetting the Stage—Conference Pageantry and Neon Vibes\n\nCrossing the bigger-than-ever exhibitor “basecamp,” we shuffle to the keynote stage where we’re greeted by tasteful conference techno, lazer lights, and rollerbladers with ski poles.\n\nThe Moscone Center is one of the few locations that could hold this many people (rumors of a record 16,000 attendees this year add to the buzz), but still feel expansive. The keynote stage is the same.\n\nCapacity is massive and seats fill up gradually in the proceeding hour. One of my seatmates strikes up some small talk immediately disclaiming that he is on the business side and not very close to the tech, but excited to see what’s new.\n\nAs we wait, I Google to see if I can grab a sneak peek of any dropping news.\n\nIt’s hard to feel bad for a tech juggernaut, especially one that just announced record earnings, but I do feel a pang of empathy for the Snowflake press team as I’m hit with a wall of stories covering their denial of any culpability in the Ticketmaster breach. It looks like Snowflake is playing the cards close to the vest this year.\n\nThis year the stage will feature co-founder Benoît Dageville, EVP of product, Christian Kleinerman, and new CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy. Vegas is not laying odds on whether AI will feature prominently.\n\nThe opening video starts with big shots at big companies extolling the power of Snowflake. Fox, Paramount, and State Street rattle off one liners in quick succession.\n\nIt doesn’t really matter what they are saying–Snowflake is showing they have captured the hearts and minds of the C-suite in a way that we probably haven’t seen since Microsoft. Much of the keynote is directed to developers, but it would be a mistake to overlook what has made Snowflake a market juggernaut.\n\nGetting Geeky with Benoît\n\nAfter a short welcome and introduction from Sridhar Ramaswamy, Benoît takes the stage. There is an authenticity and energy to founder speakers that is hard to replicate, and Snowflake is wise to harness his swagger.\n\nHe gets a warm welcome from the crowd and immediately dives into the strategic vision of Snowflake which he outlines across 5 pillars. In a nutshell:\n\nData: The ability for Snowflake to handle all structured and unstructured data types.\n\nCompute: Elastic demand to run on any workloads. Not just separating compute from storage, but “compute from compute” with multiple workloads running on the same data.\n\nModels: Access to world class AI and LLM models including CortexAI and Arctic.\n\nGovernance: Snowpark Container Services and a unified platform for data and governance. “This is AI for enterprise, not AI for planning your next vacation.”\n\nCollaboration: Native apps and data sharing so you can share across regions and organizations.\n\nHis best line which drew some laughs was during the compute section when he reassured the audience that Snowflake was not a SQL engine contrary to what some might believe, “trust me I was there.” The long-term investment in the Dataflow engine, we are reminded, is the secret sauce that makes Snowflake the most efficient on the market.\n\nThroughout this overview of the big picture he hammered what is undoubtedly the central pillar of Snowflake’s strategic vision: simplicity.\n\nTaking A Journey With Christian Kleinerman\n\nThe rest of the keynote was MCed by Snowflake EVP of product Christian Kleinerman. He’s well suited to the role as a natural showman. You can feel the spontaneous energy coming from him, which is a welcome change from tightly scripted remarks, teleprompter reading, and stage blocking.\n\nThis year each product announcement is followed by a thumping sound effect letting the audience know it’s time to clap and creating a sense of building momentum. And on their own merits, the parade of announcements is genuinely exciting.\n\nIn this parade it’s easy to lose sight of what is perhaps the most ambitious move Snowflake is making. It’s not new and it’s not something they are trying to hide, but this year it became clear that they may be able to execute on the vision of being the “iPhone of data apps.”\n\nFor a company that owns the C-Suite like Microsoft, this Apple platform and tax vision is potentially game changing. In years past, it looked like the Snowflake Marketplace might sell you a ML app or a LLM model. As buzzy as those things are, they are pocket change and rapidly becoming commoditized. What Snowflake actually wants to sell you is each part of the modern data stack.\n\nThe exhibitor “basecamp” that is 8x the size of their competitors? All future apps to be purchased on your iPhone AI data cloud.\n\nBut let’s not digress too much. Let’s hop into each section of Christian’s talk: data, apps, AI.\n\nStrengthening the Data Foundation\n\nDocumentAI, Dynamic Tables, Iceberg, and Polaris\n\nChristian starts with reminding the crowd of the power of one of last year’s big announcements (and perhaps most unfortunately named feature): DocumentAI. This bland sounding feature actually describes the incredible capability to use natural language to ask questions about documents.\n\nWith flashing strobes and a big thump Christian announces DocumentAI will move to general availability. The well prompted crowd shows a fair amount of enthusiasm which is soon dwarfed by their reaction to Christian’s next announcement on the general availability of Dynamic Tables.\n\nDynamic Tables (which Monte Carlo supports) helps to transform data on load without the need for an additional target table. This feature simplifying the movement of data is exciting for all the data and analytical engineers in attendance.\n\nServerless Tasks, the open sourcing of the Polaris catalog, and the general availability of Iceberg across all crowds also get mentions and strong responses from the crowd. You have to wonder if Iceberg was set to get a greater share of the spotlight prior to the Databricks announcement earlier this morning regarding their acquisition of Tabular, the company founded by the original creators of Apache Iceberg.\n\nInterlude with Microsoft CVP Arun Ulagaratchagan\n\nArun took the stage next in a section that was a bit shoe-horned to demonstrate their partnership with Microsoft. Broad remarks on the importance of partnership, open source data formats, interoperability and Microsoft Fabric were made.\n\nWhile a bit tangential, it is nice to see the direction these platforms are taking toward interoperability and having Fabric OneLake queryable by Snowflake (even if it may be built on the back of Delta tables).\n\nGovernance, Compliance, Lineage\n\nChristian strode back on stage for the next set of data foundation announcements. Some of the bigger features highlighted included:\n\nUniversal Search: The one search bar that will help you find everything. Now generally available.\n\nInternal Marketplace: An extension of the Snowflake Marketplace but curated for your organization. Now in private preview\n\nAI Object Description: Leveraging CortexAI to automatically generate object descriptions. This is a feature included in many data catalogs that can sometimes seem superficial and counterintuitive. What you really want to understand from documentation is not usually what AI can intuit.\n\nData classification and custom classification: The ability to specify properties at the schema level or using specific rules to better identify, tag, and govern your data.\n\nObject Insights Interface: Horizon now contains upstream and downstream data lineage for a table within the Snowflake ecosystem. This includes ML lineage to models which is exciting. Snowflake has also introduced some basic data quality rule functionality.\n\nBuild and distribute apps\n\nContainer Services and Native Apps\n\nThis was the heart of the keynote and got the most energy from the crowd. It’s also the heart of their ambitious “iPhone” of the modern data stack strategy I detailed above.\n\nChristian relays the positive feedback Snowflake has received on both services before revealing that Snowflake Native Apps and Container Services will be fully integrated. So in other words, the native app framework that allows apps to be built, deployed, and monetized through the marketplace (and skip the procurement and security reviews) is now connected with the ability for developers to containerize their workloads in an accelerated dev cycle.\n\nI ran into a former colleague launching a financial application startup that is planning to aggressively take advantage of Snowpark Container Services and Native Apps. For them, these aren’t features, it’s going to be a big component of their competitive advantage.\n\nDemo Series with Jeff Hollan\n\nBecause “we’re integrating Container Services and Native Apps” undersells the vision, Snowflake Director of Product Management Jeff Hollan comes out to demonstrate. His energy is infectious and he’s clearly having fun, bad puns and all (I’m so excited I can barely contain myself).\n\nWe get three quick and compelling demos showing:\n\nAn app that uses hybrid tables to monitor telecom infrastructure uptime,\n\nA graph analytics native app that analyzes cell phone tower location and network resiliency, and\n\nA GenAI model running in Snowpark containers that is classifying the sentiment of customer support tickets and helping to generate responses.\n\nAll of the demos are impressive, but the crowd is especially responsive to the graphs analytics app as it dawns on them that a whole host of solutions that may have required quarter or year long procurement cycles could now be at their fingertips in minutes (if they have some spare Snowflake credits rattling around).\n\nThis is when it also dawns on me that Snowflake’s unique position of owning the data storage layer gives them an incredible opportunity not just to market a few shallow ML marketing spend optimization ML apps but to be the distribution channel for the modern data stack.\n\n“If you can dream it, you can build it in Snowflake.”\n\nDevOps, Snowflake Trail, and Notebooks\n\nChristian strides back on stage and takes a moment to feed off of Jeff’s energy and demo enthusiasm. He then quickly covers some features that I personally found to be among the most exciting.\n\nData reliability engineering has been rapidly maturing and trying to reach the auspicious milestones of site reliability engineering. Only recently have data teams started to treat their query code like their application code with processes like version control and pull requests.\n\nMonte Carlo, for example, will automatically correlate a code change to any data anomalies that may result from it.\n\nChristian’s announcements are in this vein of making query code a first class citizen including Git integration, database change management, Snowflake Notebooks and Snowflake CLI. He then also announced Snowflake Trail–a new observability (think application performance management not data observability) service that will help monitor code telemetry (metrics, traces, logs) across Snowflake.\n\nAccelerate AI\n\nWe have now made it to the third and final section of the three hour keynote and while the announcements are still exciting, energy levels are definitely starting to wane.\n\nChristian starts with asking the crowd who uses Pandas to do machine learning? And plays off the lack of raised hands joking, “looks like only Benoit.” Still, the Snowpark Pandas API entering public preview is a welcome addition. We then get a review of Snowflake end-to-end machine learning capabilities including the feature store and model registry (which Monte Carlo takes advantage of).\n\nWe’re now at the big AI announcements: Arctic, Snowflake Copilot, Cortex AI and Cortex Search.\n\nChristian puts Arctic, the LLMs built and released by Snowflake in the proper context. He didn’t overhype it as the next ChatGPT. He also struck the right balance between plugging its benefits in specific functions like generating SQL while pointing out there are a lot of models in the market with barely distinguishable performance metrics.\n\nChristian then plugged the more than 20,000 people using Snowflake Copilot as part of generating or fixing code in Snowflake before announcing that it is now generally available.\n\nCortexAI, which allows any user to query the data using natural language, seemed to be positioned a bit oddly as a replacement for data analysts and as a result got a more muted response from the very human crowd.\n\nInterlude with Snowflake Cortex with Amanda Kelly\n\nAmanda Kelly, Director of Product Management at Snowflake entered the stage for a clearly very well-rehearsed demo on Snowflake’s CortexAI, Snowflake’s fully managed service for hosting LLMs to –you guessed it – simplify the process for enterprise businesses to build GenAI apps.\n\nIt was pretty impressive to see her get a proof of concept for an app up and running within Snowflake in just minutes, and on the fly she prompted the LLM (in this case Mistral) to write an email “using a lot of happy emojis” – to which it happily and automatically obliged.\n\nThe Big Finale\n\nAnd then finally, for the penultimate announcement, Christian the Showman, took the biggest risk I’ve ever seen at a major tech keynote. It was fun, filled with promise, and a flop.\n\nI love that he and Snowflake went for it, and I hope the result doesn’t create future overly scripted keynotes. After repeating, “Cortex Search is so easy anyone can create a chatbot.” He proceeds to endeavor to prove his point by inviting a random member of the audience to conduct the next demo.\n\nWhat followed was a keynote demonstration for the ages.\n\nOur demo-er, Alicia, was truly a random member of the audience. Admitting that she’d only logged into Snowflake “a few times,” Alicia was excited to jump in head first. Unfortunately this ambitious, spontaneous demo ground to a halt as we learned that anyone can create a chatbot after a few attempts with Christian Kleinerman over your shoulder directing you where to click.\n\nUltimately, it’s a powerful message. Cortext Search can create a chatbot that only responds to information it knows within a professional context. It doesn’t know how to encourage your kids to eat more broccoli.\n\nOf course, Christian couldn’t resist the “oh and one more thing” Jobsian conference post-credits announcement. And in this regard, he certainly delivered. As we leave the keynote all of our Snowflake accounts have been transitioned to Dark Mode by default. A good ending to a good keynote.\n\nTwo years ago we had data warehouses and lakehouses. Today we have AI data clouds and data intelligence platforms. But the big takeaway this year is that data remains one of the most innovative and exciting industries to be in. I wouldn’t bet against these modern data platforms finding a way to make reality match the hype.\n\nOur promise: we will show you the product.",

      "# [Finding Happiness in Major Career Moves at Monte Carlo Data by Conlan Carter on 2024-03-29](https://builtin.com/articles/finding-happiness-major-career-moves-monte-carlo-data)\nMuch like Monte Carlo’s data observability platform finds better ways for data to be useful for its customers, it has found its employees from unique and unconventional places and backgrounds.\n\nDevon McMahon, an outbound sales development representative, earned a wealth of experience working in local municipalities as a 9-1-1 dispatcher and police officer before ultimately ending up in sales. Working in law enforcement meant many long hours away from home — pushing McMahon to consider a career with healthier work-life boundaries.\n\n“I found myself unbalanced with the amount of time I was away from family and how much of myself I was leaving behind at work every day,” McMahon said.\n\nWhen McMahon’s friends suggested he’d do well in sales, he was thrilled to explore the parallels between tech sales and police work.\n\n“I was an expert in California criminal law and process similar to how a salesperson is an expert in the product and problem it can solve,” McMahon explained. “The role is to be a guide and identify positive outcomes.”\n\nAfter over a decade of working outside of the tech industry, McMahon found his way to Monte Carlo, a startup environment where growth opportunities were made easier to find by a talented team of leaders and mentors, all of whom encourage new employees to take ownership of their own career paths — whatever they may look like. While a career shift can feel to many like a setback, finding a role at Monte Carlo meant also finding a good, balanced place to thrive for McMahon.\n\n“The environment nurtures my professional and personal growth,” he said. “Sales is hard in a different way than being a police officer,” he said.\n\nOn the sales team, the support from experienced account executives and management allowed McMahon to ask questions, bounce ideas off others and envision his future in tech sales. A top-performing SDR, McMahon is now a team lead, sharing the lessons he’s learning with junior sales colleagues — many of those lessons emerged from years in public service. Now, as an SDR leader, McMahon sees his former career as unparalleled experience in customer service.\n\n“I knew the folks in the community I served didn’t get to choose who showed up to their call, and it was my responsibility to provide the best service possible. Often I would be talking to people on the worst day of their lives, and I might have been the first police officer they’d ever met. I wanted each person to understand why I was doing what I was doing and what to expect next.”\n\n“The role is to be a guide and identify positive outcomes.”\n\nNow, McMahon’s professional first impressions with the general public have an entirely different context, but thanks to the culture at Monte Carlo, he’s well-equipped with a unique background that sets him apart as a tech salesperson.\n\nWhile tech sales may have been the endpoint for McMahon as he transitioned from policework, for Backend Engineer Sam Smith, tech sales was the starting point. While it only took a year for Smith to realize tech sales was not the right fit, the exposure led him to a new goal: a role in software engineering.\n\nSmith quit his sales role to drive for Lyft full-time while attending a coding boot camp, which landed him his first role in support engineering. Eventually, this led him to a support engineer position at Monte Carlo.\n\n“It has been a windy road to get to this point,” Smith said.\n\nWhen approached about a position at Monte Carlo, Smith clarified that, while he was excited about a support engineer position, his ultimate goal was engineering itself. Leveraging his experience in support engineering for his first year at the startup, Smith helped build the early support team, ultimately leading him to his first proper software engineer title — a lateral, internal move at Monte Carlo.\n\n“When I became a software engineer, I fulfilled a goal that I had set out on almost eight years prior,” Smith said. “It was by far the biggest career success of my life and something that still gives me a lot of personal satisfaction to think about.”\n\n“Becoming a software engineer was by far the biggest career success of my life and something that still gives me a lot of personal satisfaction to think about.”\n\nThis career pivot started with Smith’s years of experience as a support engineer, which prepared him well for a fast-paced tech startup environment. As a support engineer, Smith’s skillset for “survivability” in navigating unfamiliar technology allowed him to confidently tackle new challenges, utilizing the same skills to grow as a software engineer working on new projects.\n\n“As a support engineer, you have to be able to move fast and be ok with getting thrown into new technologies and documentation and quickly pull out useful information,” Smith said. “In a lot of ways, it feels like every project I worked on in the first few months as a software engineer were stretch projects.”\n\nJoining a robust team of software engineers with decades of experience, Smith has found joy in code reviews and regular conversations about tech-related topics as continuous opportunities to become a better engineer. While his team moves quickly, Smith has embraced the speed as an “absolute blessing” as he gets a variety of engineering experience. Now, finally, on his preferred career path, Smith feels all the more excited about where this journey will take him.\n\n“I have had jobs before where the thought of being in the same role five years down the road would fill me with dread,” Smith said. “Now I think about being a software engineer at Monte Carlo five, ten years down the road, and it makes me really excited.”\n\n“I think about being a software engineer at Monte Carlo five, ten years down the road, and it makes me really excited.”\n\nStories like Smith’s and McMahon’s are not atypical on the Monte Carlo team. As Head of Recruiting, Brenda Tern has seen many similar stories of exciting career growth at Monte Carlo, including her own.\n\nWith years of experience in recruiting leadership, Tern joined Monte Carlo to help find the right talent for the growing organization, and over a year and a half, her role expanded to cover human resources. As budding companies, startups typically have a significant gap in HR resources, and as Tern became responsible for more HR-related areas of the company, she discovered a “true calling and passion for the entire people function” beyond recruiting.\n\n“I've gained more experience during my time at Monte Carlo than I ever had in any other role due to the unstructured environment that makes our culture so unique,” said Tern.\n\n“I've gained more experience during my time at Monte Carlo than I ever had in any other role due to the unstructured environment that makes our culture so unique.”\n\nAs someone uniquely positioned to speak on Monte Carlo’s career growth opportunities, Tern explained that employees are given autonomy in their career path. While not everyone holds an end goal in mind, leadership at Monte Carlo encourages their direct reports to ask questions and take on stretch projects while they can.\n\n“We want everyone to advocate for how they see their careers evolve — and leaders are there to help provide guidance and feedback, but ultimately it's up to the individual,” said Tern.\n\nAdditionally, Tern cited the success of a recently established mentorship program, where members of the women's ERG are paired with employees looking for career guidance, and executive coaching is available to employees who request it.\n\nHelping to provide many of these newer career opportunities is Tern, who has an exciting Monte Carlo career journey all her own. From recruiting to the complex world of benefits, compensation, leadership coaching and more, Tern is helping shape the careers of present and future employees at Monte Carlo Data.",

      "# [How to Run a Monte Carlo Simulation in Excel: 5 Key Steps by Chris Bernard on 2024-05-20](https://www.datamation.com/big-data/how-to-run-monte-carlo-simulation-in-excel/)\nDatamation content and product recommendations are editorially independent. We may make money when you click on links to our partners. Learn More.\n\nMonte Carlo simulations are a mathematical technique used across a diverse range of industries and fields to model difficult-to-predict scenarios and outcomes. Despite their name, you don’t have to be a gambler to appreciate their value—in fact, Monte Carlo simulations were designed to take the gamble out of strategic decision-making processes by forecasting a wide range of potential outcomes of uncertain or unforeseen events.\n\nSpreadsheets are well-suited to this kind of data modeling, and learning how to run Monte Carlo simulations in Microsoft Excel or similar software can add a powerful predictive tool to your decision-making toolset. Follow along as I create a Monte Carlo simulation using a normal distribution to generate random variables to learn how to use this valuable technique in your own work.\n\nWhat is a Monte Carlo Simulation?\n\nIn simple terms, a Monte Carlo Simulation is a virtual representation of any statistical procedure that uses randomly generated numbers to solve a problem—more specifically, it generally refers to generating an array of results known as a distribution for any statistical problem that includes a wide range of inputs sampled over and over again.\n\nImagine yourself throwing dice. If you throw them hundreds of thousands or even millions of times, you begin to understand the odds of certain combinations coming up. Monte Carlo Simulations replicate this idea, letting us perform the same kind of statistical analysis quickly and efficiently. By varying the inputs, you can model a wide range of possible outcomes and compare them to help you make decisions in the real world, making this a popular and powerful predictive tool for businesses.\n\nStep 1: Set Up Your Monte Carlo Simulation\n\nLet’s say you’re creating a human resources report about salary levels at other similar companies in your industry. To build this report, you need a fictional but accurate representation of annual salaries per employee at a competing company.\n\nYou have data that suggests the average (mean) annual salary is $40,000, and the standard deviation is $10,000. You want to generate a random salary value based on a normal distribution with the specified mean and standard deviation—each time you recalculate the formula, it should generate a new random salary that follows the given distribution.\n\nThe first step is to set up the simulation in a blank Microsoft Excel sheet as follows:\n\nCreate two columns labeled “Trial Number” and “Normal Random Variable.”\n\nCreate two fields with corresponding labels for “Simulation Mean” and “Simulation Standard Deviation.”\n\nThe mean—often referred to as the arithmetic mean or average—is a statistical measure of central tendency that represents the sum of a set of values divided by the total number of observations in that set.\n\nStandard deviation and average/mean calculations are indispensable for ensuring your simulation conforms to expectations.\n\nStandard Deviation\n\nStandard deviation measures the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values by quantifying the extent to which the individual values in a dataset deviate from the mean.\n\nA low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean.\n\nA high standard deviation suggests that the values are spread out over a wider range.\n\nStandard deviation is calculated by taking the square root of the variance—the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean. When used together, the average/mean and standard deviation provide a more complete picture of the characteristics of a dataset. This allows you to assess the spread of data points and make informed conclusions about the variability and reliability of the dataset under analysis.\n\nNormal/Gaussian Distribution\n\nMonte Carlo simulations generate a series of random observations based on a specific type of statistical distribution. These distributions can be represented as probability curves that determine the likelihood of a particular outcome.\n\nThe Monte Carlo simulation I’m creating for this example uses a normal, or Gaussian, distribution—as a result, you can expect about 68 percent of the data to fall within one standard deviation of the mean, 95 percent within two standard deviations, and approximately 99.7 percent within three standard deviations.\n\nThe normal or Gaussian distribution is perhaps best known for its visual representation as the standard bell-shaped curve; when plotted, this function is characterized by an even distribution on each side, with tails that stretch to infinity on the X-axis.\n\nIn normal distributions, the median and mean values are the same—this leaves zero skew and a symmetrical graph. Normal distributions are appropriate for continuous data that has an equal likelihood of being above or below the mean, and are commonly used for measuring continuous data that hovers around a mean value. For example, instructors typically grade their students’ test scores on a normal distribution curve as a way to ensure fairness.\n\nStep 2: Create Rows for Your Trials or Iterations\n\nIn this example, let’s simulate 100 trials or iterations for a normal random variable with a mean of 40,000 and a standard deviation of 10,000. Here’s how to set that up in the Excel sheet:\n\nIn the “Trial Number” column, insert the first two sequential values (1 and 2) manually in the first two rows below the header.\n\nHighlight the two values—the draggable green edge will appear on the bottom right of the selection.\n\nDrag the green edge down the column to create 100 sequential row values in the “Trial Number” column.\n\nStep 3: Generate Your Random Value Variables\n\nMonte Carlo simulations in Excel rely on two functions in particular: RAND() and NORM.INV. The first, RAND(), introduces variability to simulate randomness by using a built-in formula to generate a random numeric decimal value between 0 and 1. The second, NORM.INV, returns the inverse of the normal cumulative distribution for the specified mean and standard deviation—in this example, 40,000 and 10,000 respectively.\n\nTo generate these values:\n\nInsert the following formula into the first field of your “Normal Random Variable” column:\n\n=NORM.INV(RAND(),40000,10000)\n\nSelect the value and drag the green edge down the column until you have 100 normal random variables for row values.\n\nStep 4: Verify Your Values\n\nIf you take a cursory glance at your resulting values, you’ll notice that they look fairly normal in terms of the distribution—as they should. We can verify this by calculating the mean/average and standard deviation for the entire generated dataset in your Monte Carlo Simulation:\n\nInsert the following formula into the field next to your “Simulation Mean” label to get the mean/average:\n\n=AVERAGE(B2:B101)\n\nBe sure to replace “B2:B101” with the actual data range in your spreadsheet.\n\nInsert the following formula into the field next to your “Standard Deviation” label to get the standard deviation for the data set:\n\n=STDEV(B2:B101)\n\nAgain, be sure to replace “B2:B101” with the actual data range in your spreadsheet.\n\nWIth these steps completed, your Monte Carlo Simulation results should resemble my outputs in the illustration below.\n\nIn comparing the hard-coded, specified average/mean and standard deviation values with the average/mean and standard deviation values generated from the simulated dataset, you’ll see that the values seem to be in line with expectations.\n\nAverage (mean) Standard Deviation Specified 40,000 10,000 Simulation 38504.53 9418.857\n\nStep 5: Visualize Your Monte Carlo Simulation Results\n\nSince we used the NORM.INV function to create your normal random variable values, the plot should resemble a standard bell-curve distribution. You can verify this in Excel by plotting out your results in a histogram;\n\nTo verify that your results conform to the expected normal distribution curvature, select all the values in the “Normal Random Variable” column.\n\nNext, select the “Insert” menu, and click the small arrow to expand the ribbon and show all available chart options.\n\nSelect “All Charts,” and choose Histogram from the list.\n\nThe resulting histogram visually represents the distribution of outcomes, grouped into bins, as in the following image.\n\nAs you can see, your Monte Carlo simulation conforms to a standard distribution—you can trace the lines contours of a bell-shaped curve on the outer edges of the histogram.\n\nRemember, our goal was to create a fictional representation of annual salaries at a company similar to your own in order to generate an HR report about salary levels at competing businesses, and your data suggested an average (mean) annual salary of $40,000 with a standard deviation of $10,000.\n\nUsing the results of our Monte Carlo simulation, you have a scientifically-derived sample dataset of hypothetical competitor salaries to compare against your own.\n\nUsing Other Monte Carlo Simulation Distribution Types in Excel\n\nAlong with normal/Gaussian distributions, Excel provides a number of statistical distribution types to use in Monte Carlo simulations.You can find them under the Formulas menu by selecting “More Functions” and then “Statistical.” There are a few that I find more useful than others, as they represent the more common distribution types.\n\nUniform Distribution\n\nIn a uniform distribution, an equal likelihood exists between the minimum and maximum values. Visually, a uniform distribution looks like a rectangle when plotted out on a graph. Uniform distributions are often used to generate random numbers and in other scenarios that involve events that are equally likely to occur.\n\nLog-Normal Distribution\n\nAs its name implies, a log-normal distribution has a normally distributed logarithm with the mean and standard deviation. Log-normal distributions skew to the right and are ideal for modeling rate descriptions—for example, time to repair, equipment failure rates, and income distributions.\n\nPoisson Distribution\n\nPoisson distributions are ideal for addressing large distributions near the start that quickly dissipate to a long tail on one side. They’re best for predicting the number of events that transpire within a given timeframe—for example, customer purchases per quarter or transactions per day.\n\nLimitations of Monte Carlo Simulations in Excel\n\nExcel can be a useful tool for many Monte Carlo simulations, but the software’s limitations as a desktop or Software as a Service (SaaS) application are worth keeping in mind.\n\nRandom Number Generation\n\nExcel’s built-in random number generator uses a pseudorandom number generator, and the quality of randomness may be a concern in certain use cases. Advanced simulations might require more sophisticated random number generation techniques.\n\nLimited Flexibility for Complex Models\n\nExcel may not be suitable for highly complex models that involve intricate interdependencies, non-linear relationships, or dynamic systems. I suggest using specialized simulation or statistical software or programming languages in these cases.\n\nLimited Support for Advanced Techniques\n\nSome advanced Monte Carlo simulation techniques such as adaptive sampling or advanced variance reduction methods are difficult to implement in Excel without resorting to complex workarounds.\n\nLack of Parallel Processing\n\nUnlike a cloud-based data warehouse or statistical package, Excel is incapable of parallel processing and horizontal scaling. This limits its performance capabilities when carrying out simulations, as it lacks the parallelization mechanisms to speed up computations.\n\nExcel Add-Ins for Working with Data\n\nData simulation—generating synthetic data to closely mimic the properties and characteristics of real-world data—can offer data scientists, engineers, and commercial enterprises access to training data at a fraction of the cost of real world data and open doors to all kinds of predictive modeling, risk assessment, and other benefits.\n\nMonte Carlo simulations are just one example of what’s possible—and while Excel’s wide range of statistical functions is sufficient for them in many cases, it lacks some of the more advanced statistical analysis tools required for in-depth analysis of simulation results. For this, I recommend that you install one of the many third-party and Microsoft-provided statistics add-ons directly from within Excel.\n\nEven with add-ins, however, desktop spreadsheet applications are not designed for heavy computational tasks. As the number of simulations or the complexity of the model increases, computation times can quickly overcome your system. For large-scale simulations, specialized statistics software packages or programming languages may be more efficient for advanced modeling purposes.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\nHow accurate are Monte Carlo simulations?\n\nMonte Carlo simulations estimate numerical results through random sampling, so the accuracy of the Monte Carlo simulation method increases with your sample size. That said, the accuracy level is also influenced by other factors such as the quality of the random number generator—for example, Excel’s random number generator is limited in this regard.\n\nHow many Monte Carlo simulations is enough?\n\nThe ideal sample size for your Monte Carlo simulation depends on various factors, including the desired level of precision and the characteristics of the modeled system/scenario. But you can use more advanced statistical tools to determine your ideal sample size. For example, running a sensitivity analysis will let you determine how changes in sample size impact the stability/reliability of your simulation; this involves running the simulation with different sample sizes and observing the variation in outcomes.\n\nDo Monte Carlo simulations assume a normal distribution?\n\nGenerally speaking, all simulations will assume a normal distribution if your sample size is large enough; however, depending on the specific context/nature of the simulated data, one of the other distribution types may be more appropriate for your use case. Running a sensitivity analysis will allow you to compare how different data distributions affect your outcome.\n\nCan I run a Monte Carlo simulation using software other than Excel?\n\nYes, you can use comparable spreadsheet programs like Google Sheets or Zoho Sheets to run a Monte Carlo simulation. Advanced statistical software packages like IBM SPSS and SAS offer more power and options when running Monte Carlo simulations, at the cost of a steep learning curve.\n\nThe Bottom Line: Running Monte Carlo Simulations in Excel\n\nMonte Carlo simulations are easy-to-use, powerful mechanisms for enterprise decision-making, risk assessment, and forecasting. Despite some limitations, Excel and similar spreadsheet tools remain competent options for carrying out rudimentary Monte Carlo simulations and should prove an indispensable statistical instrument in your analytical toolkit. For more sophisticated applications, I recommend that you consider specialized simulation software packages or programming languages like Python, R, or MATLAB.",

I headed up the Data function at London-based Scale-up Codat. I’m now CEO at Orchestra, which is a data release pipeline tool that helps Data Teams release data into production reliably and efficiently 🚀\n\n️️⭐️ Also check out our Substack and our internal blog ⭐️\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe term “Data Observability” really took off as a sector in around 2021 as organisations had too much money and needed a quick and dirty solution to data quality and monitoring.\n\nThat said, the overarching idea with a data collection tool is to ensure that data being used in production has a high degree of “quality”. Quality iself is split into a few different areas. Some of these are accuracy, completeness, normality and well-definition.\n\nI’ve never liked the phrase “Data Quality”.

      "# [ATLAS releases 65 TB of open data for research on 2024-06-05](https://atlas.cern/Updates/News/Open-Data-Research)\nThe ATLAS Experiment at CERN has made two years’ worth of scientific data available to the public for research purposes. The data include recordings of proton–proton collisions from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at a collision energy of 13 TeV. This is the first time that ATLAS has released data on this scale, and it marks a significant milestone in terms of public access and utilisation of LHC data.\n\n“Open access is a core value of CERN and the ATLAS Collaboration,” says Andreas Hoecker, ATLAS Spokesperson. “Since its beginning, ATLAS has strived to make its results fully accessible and reusable through open access archives such as arXiv and HepData. ATLAS has routinely released open data for educational purposes. Now, we’re taking it one step further — inviting everyone to explore the data that led to our discoveries.”\n\nReleased under the Creative Commons CC0 waiver, ATLAS has made public all the data collected by the experiment during the 2015 and 2016 proton–proton operation of the LHC. This is approximately 65 TB of data, representing over 7 billion LHC collision events. In addition, ATLAS has released 2 billion events of simulated “Monte Carlo” data, which are essential for carrying out a physics analysis.\n\nExternal researchers, in particular, are encouraged to explore the ATLAS open data. “Along with the data, we have provided comprehensive documentation on several of our analyses, guiding users through our process step-by-step,” says Zach Marshall, ATLAS Computing co-Coordinator. “These guides provide first-hand experience of working on a real ATLAS result, allowing anyone to test our tools, and evaluate the systematic uncertainties associated with the result for themselves.”\n\nATLAS traditionally collaborates with non-ATLAS scientists through short-term associations, granting them full access to ATLAS data, internal tools, and information. Through the open data, ATLAS researchers hope to further nurture this dialogue and collaboration. “In particular,” adds Zach, “we’d like to encourage phenomenologists and also computer scientists to explore our datasets, instead of relying on mock-ups.”\n\nToday’s release builds upon previous open data releases for educational use (in 2016 and 2020). “All of our open data releases are now available through the ATLAS open data website,” says Dilia Portillo, ATLAS Outreach and Education co-Coordinator. “The website includes multi-level documentation, video tutorials and online tools aimed at the full-spectrum of users, from high school students to senior particle physics researchers. In addition, the software used to create the education-use open data has been released. This provides a seamless transition from the research open data to all the tutorials for outreach and education, including newly updated Higgs-boson discovery documentation. With a bit of time and dedication, you can go from being a relative novice to carrying out your own analysis.”\n\nThe ATLAS open data website also serves as a hub for the community, which includes teachers, students, enthusiasts and, now, scientists. Anyone diving into the open data can also directly engage with ATLAS physicists, who are available to respond to user feedback and take suggestions.\n\nThis release marks the start of more to come, with ATLAS’ first release of lead-lead-nuclei collision data up next. The ATLAS Collaboration, along with the other main LHC experiment collaborations, has committed to making all of its data publicly accessible after a certain time. Openness is deeply ingrained in the culture of high-energy physics, enabling greater accessibility, reproducibility and better science.\n\nBegin your journey with ATLAS open data by following the tutorial below.\n\nGet started with ATLAS open data:\n\nQuick Start: beginners guide to the 13 TeV dataset released for education.
