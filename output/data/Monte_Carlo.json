      "# [Delivering End-to-End Data Trust with Snowflake and Monte Carlo by Scott O'Leary on 2021-04-29](https://www.montecarlodata.com/blog-snowflake/)\nAs companies increasingly leverage data-driven insights to drive innovation and maintain their competitive edge, it’s important that this data is accurate and reliable. With Monte Carlo and Snowflake’s strategic partnership, teams can finally trust their data through end-to-end Data Observability and automated lineage of their entire data ecosystem, all the way down to field-level values.\n\nHas your CEO ever told you that the numbers in a report you showed her looked way off?\n\nHas a customer ever called out errors in your product’s dashboards?\n\nWhat about a rise in a field’s null rate that went unnoticed for days or weeks because there wasn’t a noticeable change in your KPIs?\n\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, you’re not alone. Data downtime, in other words, periods of time when data is missing, inaccurate, or otherwise erroneous, is an all-too-familiar reality for even the best data teams, costing them millions of dollars in wasted revenue and up to 50 percent of the data engineering team’s time that could otherwise be spent moving the needle for the business.\n\nTo help companies trust their data, Monte Carlo is excited to announce our partnership with Snowflake by bringing our automated Data Observability Platform to the Data Cloud. Data teams relying on Snowflake to derive critical insights about their business can now leverage the power of automated anomaly detection, monitoring, and end-to-end lineage to prevent bad data from affecting downstream consumers.\n\nAchieving reliable Snowflake pipelines with data observability\n\nThe Snowflake – Monte Carlo integration makes it easy for data organizations to identify, resolve, and prevent data downtime and data quality issues before they impact the business, giving companies confidence in the reliability of their data and the products they power.\n\nWith this partnership, Snowflake customers can now:\n\nAchieve end-to-end Data Observability without writing any code. Get end-to-end data observability for your Snowflake data pipelines with a 20-minute, no-code implementation process. Access out-of-the-box visibility into data Freshness, Volume, Distribution, Schema, and Lineage just by plugging Monte Carlo into your Data Cloud.\n\nKnow when data breaks, as soon as it happens. Monte Carlo continuously monitors your Snowflake assets and proactively alerts stakeholders to data issues. Monte Carlo’s machine learning-first approach gives data teams broad coverage for common data issues with minimal configuration, and business-context-specific checks layered on top ensure you’re covered at each stage of your data pipeline.\n\nFind the root cause of data quality issues, fast. Monte Carlo gives teams a single pane of glass to investigate data issues, drastically reducing time to resolution. By bringing all information and context for your pipelines into one place, teams spend less time firefighting data issues and more time improving the business.\n\nImmediately understand the business impact of bad data. End-to-end lineage for your pipelines from the point it enters Snowflake (or further upstream!) down to the analytics and business intelligence layer, data teams are able to assess the business impact of their data issues, ultimately preventing decision making based on bad data.\n\nPrevent data downtime. Give your teams full visibility into your Snowflake pipelines and how they impact downstream reports and dashboards to make more informed development decisions. With Monte Carlo, teams can better manage breaking changes to ELTs and BI assets by knowing what will be impacted and who to notify.\n\nIn addition to supporting existing mutual customers, Monte Carlo provides end-to-end, automated coverage for teams migrating from their legacy stacks to the Snowflake Data Cloud Platform. Moreover, Monte Carlo’s security-first approach to Data Observability ensures that data never leaves your Snowflake environment.\n\nWhat Monte Carlo and Snowflake customers have to say\n\nThe Zebra\n\nThe Zebra, a leading insurance comparison site, makes it easy for consumers across the United States to compare and save on car and home insurance quotes. The company provides over 1,800 car insurance products from more than 200 national insurers, a monumental feat that relies on real-time decision making powered by data from disparate third-party vendors and partners. The Zebra’s data team uses Snowflake and Monte Carlo to ensure that their data pipelines are performant and reliable.\n\n“As a data leader, there’s nothing worse than not being able to trust your data,” said Shea Spalding, Head of Data Governance at The Zebra. “The combination of Snowflake’s data cloud and Monte Carlo’s data observability platform helps ensure that our data is accessible and fresh at each stage of the data life cycle. With this stack, my team can better collaborate to resolve issues, work towards data trust, and build better products for our customers.”\n\nMindbody\n\nAs the world’s leading wellness services marketplace, Mindbody is a company with data at heart. Alex Soria, VP of Data & Analytics, is leading the charge with a team of over 25 data scientists, business intelligence analysts, and data engineers responsible for ensuring that the insights powering their product is fresh and reliable.\n\nAs the world’s leading wellness services marketplace, Mindbody is a company with data at heart. Alex Soria, VP of Data & Analytics, is leading the charge with a team of over 25 data scientists, business intelligence analysts, and data engineers responsible for ensuring that the insights powering their product is fresh and reliable.\n\n“Data-driven decision making is a huge priority for Mindbody, but our analytics are only as reliable as the data that informs them,” said Alex. “We are working with Monte Carlo to monitor and alert for abnormalities in our Snowflake pipelines, such as null values and duplicate data, that would otherwise go unnoticed until it’s too late. By partnering with Snowflake and Monte Carlo, my team can achieve more powerful analytics and full data reliability.”\n\nCollaborative Imaging\n\nCollaborative Imaging is a radiologist-owned alliance dedicated to improving the lives of physicians and patients everywhere through technology. With over 18,000 patients seen per day and nearly 1M radiological exams read per month, the alliance is charting a course for the future of this industry by giving providers the solutions and processes necessary to better serve their communities.\n\nTo power their business, Collaborative Imaging needs fast analytics powered by clean and reliable data, which is no easy feat given the size and scope of their distributed data ecosystem. To gain greater visibility into the health of their data at each stage of its life cycle, they needed a way to understand how data flows into their data warehouse, as well as be alerted when changes occur in schema or distribution of the many data sources which are ingested into their Snowflake data warehouse. Monte Carlo empowered them to troubleshoot and resolve issues before downstream data consumers are impacted.\n\n“Collaborative Imaging’s analytics platform helps physicians and patients connect the dots between disparate data points in their healthcare journey, but our insights are only as reliable as the data feeding our system. Dirty data is a landmark of healthcare analytics, and a lot of the work we do revolves around cleaning and making sense of this data to put it into one repository,” said Jacob. “Combined with Snowflake’s powerful Data Cloud and Monte Carlo’s Data Observability Platform, we can resolve these problems before they reach the business. My executives are happy and I can trust our data.”\n\nWant to learn more about how data observability can help you trust your data?

Vendors and Subprocessors are permitted to use the Personal Information we share with them only as necessary to assist us in the provision of the Services and are required by written agreement not to retain, use or disclose your Personal Information for any other purpose.\n\nBusiness Transfers: We may choose to buy or sell assets or our company and may share and/or transfer customer information in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.\n\nProtection of Company and Others: We may access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our terms and conditions and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety and security of Monte Carlo, our employees, our users, or others.\n\nSecurity Of Your Personal Information\n\nWe use a variety of industry-standard security measures to help protect your Personal Information as required by relevant law. We also require you to enter a password to access your account information. Please do not disclose your account password to unauthorized persons. Although we are committed to protecting your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Additionally, our customers and your employer must prevent unauthorized access to accounts and Personal Information by selecting and protecting passwords appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser.\n\nHow Is My Personal Information Retained?\n\nWe keep Personal Information as long as it is necessary or relevant for the purposes for which it was collected and in compliance with our retention policies. We also keep information as otherwise required by law.\n\nTo determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider not only applicable legal requirements, but also the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Information, the purposes for which we process your Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means.\n\nWhat Choices Do I Have Regarding My Personal Information?\n\nYou can choose not to disclose Personal Information to us, but keep in mind that if you are a customer or an employee of a customer, some Personal Information may be needed to register with us or to take advantage of some of our Service features.\n\nTo stop receiving our promotional emails follow the instructions in any promotional message you get from us or contact us as described at the end of this Privacy Policy. If you opt out of getting marketing messages, you will continue to receive messages from us about your relationship with us where permitted by law.\n\nYou may request deletion of your information or account by sending a request to privacy@montecarlodata.com. If you are an employee of one of our customers, we will refer your request to that Monte Carlo customer. Some information may remain in our records after your deletion request.\n\nYou can control cookies and tracking tools. To learn how we - and our vendors - use cookies and other tracking tools, and to read our Do Not Track policy, please click here.\n\nYour Legal Rights Regarding Your Personal Information\n\nUnder certain circumstances you may have rights under applicable data protection laws in relation to your Personal Information. Where applicable, you may have the right to:\n\nRequest information about how we collect, process, use and share your Personal Information (commonly known as a “right to know request”).\n\nRequest access to your Personal Data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.\n\nRequest correction of the Personal Information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.\n\nRequest erasure of your Personal Information (commonly known as a “request to be forgotten”). This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Information. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your Personal Information to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply in full with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.\n\nObject to processing of your Personal Information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.\n\nRequest restriction of processing of your Personal Information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Information in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.\n\nRequest the transfer of your Personal Information to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.\n\nWithdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain Services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.\n\nIf you wish to exercise any of the above rights please contact privacy@montecarlodata.com. You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of the other rights), and Monte Carlo does not discriminate based on whether you choose to exercise your choice and rights. We will not, based on your exercise of rights, deny our Services to you, charge you different rates, provide a different level or quality of Services to you, or suggest that you may receive such different treatment. However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.\n\nAdditionally, we may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. As part of the verification process, we match the information submitted as part of your request against information stored by Monte Carlo. In some instances, we will require additional information in order to verify your request. If an authorized third party makes a data subject request on your behalf, we will require sufficient written proof that you have designated them as your authorized agent. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within 30 days. Occasionally it may take us longer than 30 days if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.\n\nCalifornia Residents’ Rights\n\nSubject to certain limitations, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides California consumers the right to request to know more details about the categories or specific pieces of Personal Information we collect (including how we use and disclose this information), to delete their Personal Information, to opt out of any “sales” that may be occurring, and to not be discriminated against for exercising these rights. If you are a resident of California (or another jurisdiction that provides comparable rights) and would like to make a request, please contact us 548 Market Street, PMB 59994, San Francisco, CA 94104 or via email at privacy@montecarlodata.com. If you are submitting on someone else’s behalf, we may ask for additional information to verify your identity. This may include providing a signed letter verifying your right to make this request. We do not sell Personal Information to third parties for money or any other consideration, as that term is generally understood. We do not sell Personal Information of minors under the age of 16. We will not discriminate against you because you have exercised any of your rights under the CCPA.\n\nFor EU, UK and Swiss Residents\n\nIf Personal Information pertaining to you as an individual has been submitted to the Services by or on behalf of one of our customers and you wish to exercise any data protection rights you may have in respect of that data under applicable law, including (as applicable) the right to access, port, correct, amend or delete such data, please inquire with the relevant Monte Carlo customer directly. We have a limited ability to access the content of our customers. However, if you wish to make your request directly to us, please provide the name of the Monte Carlo customer who submitted your data to our Services. We will refer your request to that Monte Carlo customer.\n\nData Privacy Framework Statement\n\nMonte Carlo complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.

EU, UK and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of Personal Information received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, should first contact Monte Carlo at: privacy@montecarlodata.com. For any complaints that cannot be resolved with Monte Carlo directly, Monte Carlo has chosen to cooperate, for the purposes of the DPF Principles, with the JAMS DPF Program. Information on how to contact JAMS is available at https://www.jamsadr.com/dpf-dispute-resolution. Under certain conditions, as further explained in the DPF Principles, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.

If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at privacy@montecarlodata.com.\n\nThird Party Sites And Services\n\nIf you click on a link to a third party website or service, a third party may also transmit cookies to you. Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t responsible for their privacy policies and practices. Please be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third parties may not honor “Do Not Track” requests you have set using your browser or device.\n\nUpdates To This Privacy Policy\n\nWe may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes to our Privacy Policy as required by law. We will also post an updated copy on the sites where this appears. Please check our site periodically for updates.",
      "# [Cookie Policy by Ryan Kelch on 2022-09-12](https://www.montecarlodata.com/cookie-policy/)\nWe Use Tracking Tools\n\nWe collect personal information about users over time and across different websites when you use this website or service. We also have third parties that collect personal information this way. To do this, we use several common tracking tools. These may include browser cookies.

It also includes our vendors and third parties who place tools on our sites or apps.\n\nWhy We Use Tracking Tools\n\nWe use tracking tools for many reasons, including to engage in interest-based advertising. Interest-based advertising or “online behavioral advertising” is serving advertising content to you based on information gathered from you over time across multiple sites or other platforms. It includes serving ads to you after you leave our website, encouraging you to return. It also includes serving ads we think are relevant based on your browsing habits or online activities. These ads might be served on websites. They might also be served in emails. We might serve these ads, or third parties may serve ads. They might be about our products or services other companies’ products or services.\n\nWe may also use tracking tools:\n\nTo recognize new or past website visitors.\n\nTo improve our website and to better understand your visits on our platforms.\n\nTo integrate with third party social media websites.\n\nTo observe your behaviors and browsing activities over time across multiple websites or other platforms.\n\nTo better understand the interests of our customers and our website visitors.\n\nHow We Gather Information For Interest-Based Advertising\n\nWe use information you make available to us when you interact with us, our affiliates, and other third parties to decide what content is relevant to you. We gather this information using the tracking tools described above. For example, we or our partners might look at your browsing behaviors. We or our partners might also look at your location. We might look at these activities on our platforms or the\n\nplatforms of others.\n\nWe work with third parties who help gather this information. These third parties might link your name or email address to other information they collect. This might include online usage information.\n\nHow To Control Certain Tracking Tools\n\nYour browser may give you the ability to control cookies. How you do so depends on the type of cookie. You can set your browser to reject cookies. To find out more about how to control cookies from your web browser, please visit here. To control flash cookies, which we may use, you can go here. Why? Because flash cookies cannot be controlled through your browser settings.\n\nOur Do Not Track Policy: Some browsers have “do not track” features that allow you to tell a website not to track you. These features are not all uniform. We do not currently respond to those signals. If you block cookies, certain features on our sites may not work. If you block or reject cookies, not all of the tracking described here will stop.\n\nChoices you make are both browser and device specific.\n\nHow To Control Interest-Based Advertising\n\nThe Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising program provides consumers with the ability to opt-out of having their online behavior recorded and used for advertising purposes. To opt-out of interest based advertising you can visit here and follow the instructions on that page.\n\nThe Digital Advertising Alliance also offers a tool for opting out of the collection of cross-app data on a mobile device for interest-based advertising. To exercise choice for companies participating in this tool, download the AppChoices app here .

You should review their support materials and/or the device settings.",

I have to write an article about Monte Carlo and I'd love to get some insights from people who use this platform on a daily basis. Could you please help me? :)\n\n1. What does Monte Carlo help you accomplish?\n2. What are its most remarkable features?\n3. Where does it fall flat or not deliver as expected?\n4. Could you let me know why you chose Monte Carlo over some other competitor?\n\nOr, feel free to write anything about your experience with Monte Carlo.\n\nThank you!\n\nP.S. I'm an independent freelancer. I am not affiliated with Monte Carlo.\n\n## Comment ID kbvt7un with +9 score by [(7twenty8, Reddit, 2023-12-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/189p5b8/research_tell_me_about_your_experience_with_monte/kbvt7un/) (in reply to ID 189p5b8):\nFirst, I understand that this is your business. But from our perspective, being asked for comments on something that will turn into an article is really concerning. Especially because you're asking underhanded questions that are designed to make your client look good.\n\nSo to start, you should spend some time thinking about ethics. You've basically asked a subreddit to do all of your fucking work for you and you don't even have enough respect to ask for balanced feedback.\n\nSecond, Monte Carlo (the company) is terribly governed - there is absolutely no reason that any remotely intelligent company would name themselves Monte Carlo. They're incredibly overpriced. And their sales staff doesn't even know the basics of the platform. I can't imagine being so masochistic that I'd do business with them.\n\nAnd third, sending someone to a DE subreddit to grab positive feedback about their tool is very dodgy. They clearly don't understand or have any respect for data engineers. That's not surprising because I'm familiar with what a shitshow they are. But it's actually kind of upsetting to think a company genuinely doesn't give a shit about any of its potential customers.\n\nYou might want to show the person who hired you how you collect information for your articles. This is a pretty big subreddit and I'm embarrassed on their behalf and on yours as well.\n\n### Comment ID kbxkyqh with +3 score by [(helenegeria, Reddit, 2023-12-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/189p5b8/research_tell_me_about_your_experience_with_monte/kbxkyqh/) (in reply to ID kbvt7un):\nHi, u/7twenty8!  \n\n\nI appreciate your honest feedback, and I want to assure you that I am an independent copywriter conducting research for an article. I am not affiliated with Monte Carlo in any way, shape or form :)  \n\n\nMy goal is to gather insights from engineers who use a specific platform. I have multiple topics to cover, and Monte Carlo is just one of them. I couldn't possibly be an employee in disguise for all those companies :) I never use the raw answers in my article. I don't send screenshots to my customer. I just use the input as a guide. It tells me what's interesting to explore further, what feature is worth mentioning in the article, etc.  \n\n\nI apologize if my approach raised concerns about ethics. That was not my intention, and I value transparency in my work. I understand the importance of getting honest feedback, both positive and negative. I'm new to Reddit and maybe I'm unfamiliar with some dodgy practices you might have encountered in the past.  \n\n\nYou said, \"you're asking underhanded questions that are designed to make your client look good\". Again, my client is NOT Monte Carlo and I did ask question #3, \"Where does it fall flat or not deliver as expected?\".  \n\n\n\"You've basically asked a subreddit to do all of your fucking work for you\" - I wish that were true! :)) A long-form article takes me days of work. If I could just copy-paste the answers and deliver multiple articles in a day, I'd be rich and typing this answer from a sunny beach, while sipping Martinis...shaken, not stirred, of course :))  \n\n\n\"You might want to show the person who hired you how you collect information for your articles.\"- I took several copywriting courses and this is what they teach. We need to start with Voice of Customer Data, i.e. surveys, interviews, reviews. I use reddit, G2, Amazon, Yelp, and Social Media, depending on the product/service that I have to write about. I don't write copy exclusively for SaaS. I'm not sure exactly why you're embarrassed on my behalf. I'm just trying to do my job and follow the process we're taught in the copywriting courses.  \n\n\nOnce again, I do appreciate your time and honesty.  \nHave a great day & a productive week! :)\n\n#### Comment ID kcbwpl7 with +1 score by [(7twenty8, Reddit, 2023-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/189p5b8/research_tell_me_about_your_experience_with_monte/kcbwpl7/) (in reply to ID kbxkyqh):\nMy secret weapon is that my academic background is in marketing and I've made most of my money working with vast amounts of consumer data. It doesn't seem like your copywriting courses taught you about how segments are all different and require slightly different research methods.\n\nEngineers (particularly data engineers) are extremely skeptical. So all you did was damage your client's brand. Want proof? Nobody said anything positive in this entire thread. 144,000 users in this subreddit and not one single positive comment about your client. The odds of that seem astronomically low but that's the most common result with these sorts of marketing exercises in this segment.

All just to create more buzz and spam the name everywhere without really showing what it is about or having some fremium/OSS core. \n\nIMO reading about what they do, I feel like you can achieve all of this by sticking to existing software tooling (collect metrics [e.g. datadog], build observability into you data testing and log that as you would log everything else, or save as metadata etc.).

I really recommend these lectures. He's a fantastic teacher. This is his current semester, so it's not yet complete. Previous years' courses are also available if you outpace his output. \n\nMC methods are surprisingly powerful for how simple they are, conceptually. Firstly, they can replace the ocean of test statistics that you have to grapple with using frequentist methods. With a single process you can do pretty much any hypothesis test without basing the overall assessment of the hypothesis on an arbitrary cutoff point like alpha=5%.\n\nYou can incorporate domain knowledge in your models. If, for example, you know that a parameter *has* to be positive (because it's a count of some real world thing) and also should probably be somewhere between 5 and 10, and is very unlikely to be 10,000 you can include this in your model even if you don't have any data for it.\n\nMC methods also let you design relationships between variables, let you get information about unobserved quantities that either affect or are affected by observed quantities, can be used as part of a causal analysis, can give you a tool for simulating a contra-positive (what would have happened otherwise), can give you highly explainable results, can work on smaller data sets, can give you not only point estimates but credible intervals (which are much more intuitive to non-technical people than confidence intervals are).\n\n### Comment ID j5ztk8k with +1 score by [(Coco_Dirichlet, Reddit, 2023-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10ljew2/monte_carlo_simulation/j5ztk8k/) (in reply to ID j5yyfh4):\nMCMC is not the same as MC\n\n## Comment ID j5ylvf6 with +3 score by [(OneSprinkles6720, Reddit, 2023-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10ljew2/monte_carlo_simulation/j5ylvf6/) (in reply to ID 10ljew2):\nMonte carlo gives me guidelines I can use to yank a financial markets trading algo out of production.

How do you calculate the uncertainty for those predictions/predicted probabilities? Well, the easiest way to go about it is by doing MC simulation because in non-linear models, the uncertainty for each prediction is going to change for each value of X.\n\nYou can also use Monte Carlo simulations for cross-validation.\n\nYou can also use Monte Carlo simulations when you are comparing a series of different models performance, on average, with a lot of data you simulated (fake data) that has a particular problem (e.g. heteroskedastic data, or serially correlated data).\n\nAnd can people in the comments spot implying MCMC is the same as MC. It's not! MCMC includes an MC, but OP asked about MC. They aren't used for the same problems. If you take a Bayesian Stats course, you'll cover MCMC but MC is just going to be a tiny part of the course.  \n\nThere are several books that are *only* on Monte Carlo simulations.

That said, in general courses don't focus a lot on the presentation of results/prediction/visualization/explanation, and MC is used a lot on that area.

For example, computing the price of a path dependent option using a nontrivial (í.e. something more advanced than black scholes) model for the underlying asset means you are probably looking at an sde which has no known closed form solution for the pdf, so how will you compute the risk neutral expectation of the payoff function (meaning the price of the option)?

That's usually in conjunction with a user story mapping process (Jeff Patton), and harks back to how Extreme Programming (XP) worked.   \n  \nAs soon as access to the customer becomes a constraint, you'll tend to slide towards larger \"batch sizes\" and the need for more \"upstream\" product discovery and \"downstream\" UAT and feedback.  \n  \nIn those cases you tend to move from the \"thin slice of value\" model and decompose the \"big\" work into things that are more work-flow or task oriented, based on the \"up front requirements\"   \n  \nIt's not super agile, because the big batch sizes will still tend to mean an \"inspect and rework\" approach to quality (in a \"built the right thing\" sense)   \n  \nHowever it's also not really waterfall, as you will still be doing all the agile \"build the thing right\" stuff around CI/CD, automated testing, agile test quadrants and even stuff like TDD and pairing.\n\nThat said, I'd counsel it's really down to the team in terms of how they want to self-manage the work.  The data they are tracking should help them to locate bottlenecks and continuously improve how they are delivering.  \n  \nIt's also up to the business how they want to control investment risk.  The bigger the batch size, the greater the sunk-costs, and the more you stand to lose if you are wrong about what customers value.  \n  \nIf you have the access to capital that supports the size of bet you are making, then that's okay.  If you don't, then that's where the wider business problems start.\n\n## Comment ID lkkn9zp with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-08-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/agile/comments/1f4akow/you_experience_with_monte_carlo_simulation_in/lkkn9zp/) (in reply to ID 1f4akow):\nMonte Carlo is good if you have good input to that.\n\nYou need to use cardinals for MC afaik, with ordinals such as story points (which are nonsense) the results are nonsene.\n\nI don't want to go into too many details as to use MC requires some basic knowledge in math & statistics.

MC simulation achieved better results.\n* One of the most subtle, but best things about moving to something like MC simulation is the introduction of probability into forecasts. You no longer communicate: \"Yeah, we'll be done on Feb 30. We think.\" and move to \"We'll be finished on Feb 30, x% of the time\" where x is your risk tolerance.\n* A lot of people make a big deal about sample set. I found that 10 pieces of cycle time/throughput data was sufficient to start generating results.\n* While small, same sized stories can help, I found you can still use MC simulation without working on story size. What a backlog with same sized stories will do is \"narrow\" the distribution curve of throughput results, which will reduce the impact of risk levels on the forecast. Forecasts with randomly sized stories are still valid, but changes in risk tolerance will produce a wider range of results.\n* Some semblance of control over cycle time, and thus throughput, is more important than story size, imo. But you really shouldn't be saying you're using kanban if you're not controlling WIP.\n* You'll need to prune your data set. Obvious outliers should be thrown away. You probably want a horizon for the data so you're biased towards more recent results. And, of course, fundamental changes to critical things like team composition, etc can render previous forecasts unreliable.\n\n### Comment ID lkk3skz with +3 score by [(mippzon, Reddit, 2024-08-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/agile/comments/1f4akow/you_experience_with_monte_carlo_simulation_in/lkk3skz/) (in reply to ID lkjzn6p):\nThanks for an extensive answer! Based on this it seems like we are doing most things right already and that MC can help us further. Looking in Jira we have more than two years of data to base the simulations on if we want. \n\nWhat we need to improve is to bring back the WIP limits again (our team manager just informed them even if we had them) and think about the sizing of items.

I believe it might be a plugin for Jira now??\n* Even with expert Kanban teams, you might find yourself with a story/ticket that gets put on hold due to some emergency, or because someone is sick and there's no one to pick it up, or life just generally intervenes. For example, a ticket might get started before Christmas, just not get finished before the break, and sit there until the new year. Yeah, with enough brain sweat we could have probably come up with a good enough adjusted cycle time, but we just didn't want to bother. One of the things we wanted from the MC approach was just less handling of stories. \n* I'm not sure what you're asking for in terms of variance. Do you mean what's the farthest we've missed a forecast? Or how much the forecast varies based on risk? \n   * If it's the latter, then yeah, some of our forecasts generated with small data sets had great sensitivity to risk level. That's the one advantage of a larger data set and/or smaller stories. \n   * If it's the former, we tended to set quarterly releases to customers, so we'd use a \"How many\" simulation to tell the PO how many stories they could reasonably pick from the product backlog. We were generally within 10% of the forecasted # of stories while velocity wasn't as accurate (plus velocity generally deals with averages, which is essentially a coin toss). \n\nHope that answers your questions.\n\n### Comment ID lkw06s0 with +1 score by [(AskGroundbreaking124, Reddit, 2024-08-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/agile/comments/1f4akow/you_experience_with_monte_carlo_simulation_in/lkw06s0/) (in reply to ID lkjzn6p):\nNice!\n\nSince you mentioned User Story size, I would be very grateful if you could share your view in a situation I have already shared in other comment.\n\nI have just joined a startup that is all into Kanban, using Monte Carlo and stuff but their Work Item is Tasks (like technical ones, frontend, backend and stuff), they jump from epics right to technical tasks, and then all the metrics and simulations a are applied in this task level.\n\nIs does not make any sense to me.\nI believe the right level to estimate, simulate and get metrics would be User Stories, I am right?\n\nIf so, how do the devs breakdown the user stories and track them in the board?\n\nThanks for any advice!\n\n#### Comment ID lkx1w9j with +1 score by [(DingBat99999, Reddit, 2024-09-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/agile/comments/1f4akow/you_experience_with_monte_carlo_simulation_in/lkx1w9j/) (in reply to ID lkw06s0):\nI guess the first question is: Is it working? If so, then why change it?\n\nThe second question is: Where are they measuring throughput? At the epic level? If so, how big are their epics? Is this just a case of different labels?\n\nThere's nothing particularly special about user stories wrt kanban or MC. Any old item will do for throughput. In Scrum we like user value, which is typically only realized when a backlog item is delivered. But user stories themselves are an XP mechanism. \n\nSo long as this team is truly using Kanban properly, is watching for bottlenecks related to the silos, is managing WIP, etc, then there shouldn't be anything wrong with making the level of focus the task on the board. There might be some difficulty tying throughput to value, and I'm not sure how they're using MC for forecasting, but it's not absolutely wrong.\n\n## Comment ID lkswkhp with +2 score by [(sf-keto, Reddit, 2024-08-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/agile/comments/1f4akow/you_experience_with_monte_carlo_simulation_in/lkswkhp/) (in reply to ID 1f4akow):\nMonte Carlo is great for stakeholders, because you can give actual dates at 85-90% levels of service.

I think you need to frame the method in knowing that a huge part of the practical application of mathematics before the 20th century involved manually computing different functions. \n\nHuge reference works of tables were produced of sines and cosines of different angles and the digits of pi to offload computation time for precise calculations. Some mathematicians spent years creating these kinds of tables. It's been argued that some of Newton's discoveries were the probable result of him seeing patterns in the huge numbers of manual computations that he used to do. Yes, even 'serious' people like Newton did this kind of thing.\n\nConceptually, an abacus is analogous to a computer. It's just offloading computation onto a physical process. Disregarding the technical breakthroughs of the transistor and the miniaturization of electronics, a computer is, conceptually, just finding a way to have calculations be done by the universe, through moving electrons around, rather than doing them by hand on a piece of paper. However, just by doing this very simple thing more quickly you are able to create entirely new fields, like computer graphics, that would be unthinkable in a paradigm where calculations have to be done by hand.\n\nSimilarly, the realization that: \"all of these problems that we can't solve analytically, I think we can solve them numerically by setting up a situation where a device will just 'spit out the correct answer'\" was pretty brilliant. Sure, this idea is somewhat obvious once advanced computers are established as an existing thing, but Ulam invented the method in the infancy of computers. Before computers, this kind of approach would have been unthinkable. If your issue is that \"Ulam shouldn't get so much credit because anyone could have come up with the idea once computers became established\" then maybe you're correct. But disregarding the question of credit and just considering the method itself, doesn't it almost send chills down your spine that we can just set up a system correctly and then have it give us the answer to a question that we would have no way of finding out the answer to on our own?\n\n### Comment ID kppannf with +51 score by [(rhubarb_man, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kppannf/) (in reply to ID kpp8ns6):\nI see, thank you.

Some of these stunning applications come in theory CS, particularly in counting or sampling from a set of combinatorial structures. The MCMC method runs riot here.\n\nOne example which I have directly worked on is the uniform sampling of proper colorings of a graph. Note that the set of all colorings, proper and improper, with k colors of a graph with n vertices is exponentially large. What you want to do however is produce a uniform sample from the set of proper colorings, i.e., colorings which impart two different colors across any edge of the graph. This set is exponentially smaller than the set of all colorings, and it is unstructured. So we have absolutely no clue how to produce a uniform sample from this set other than the Monte Carlo method. \n\nAnother interesting example is sampling independent sets of a graph. Note that usually this is a very hard problem. However, using the MCMC method we discovered that there is a range of parameters for which this sampling is easy, and beyond a certain threshold suddenly becomes hard in the NP hard sense. It turns out this threshold is related to the physics of phase transitions of certain models of magnetism! \n\nOther places where deep insights have been gleaned from this technique is the theory of expanders  which finds use in everything from modelling large networks to error correcting codes. \n\nThere are literally reams of literature dedicated to this line of work in theory CS, each more surprising than the last. \n\nI hope this answer helps somewhat.\n\n## Comment ID kpoxxzt with +3 score by [(CatOfGrey, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kpoxxzt/) (in reply to ID 1amy1gh):\nWhat makes Monte Carlo interesting for me, is that it can be used to model outcomes based on non-standard distributions.\n\nIn my practice, I have done Monte Carlo work with survey data.  The responses for a distribution, but it's not one from any book.  Responses to questions on various topics may have varying amounts of correlation, leading to interactions that can be messy to model on their own.  \n\nIt's not a theoretical technique, it's a practical technique, used for practical data.  It hasn't been used for millenia - we weren't hypothesis testing, or considering the concept of non-standard distributions.  \n\nTL:DR;  For problem from the text book, you are right - Monte Carlo is trivial or unnecessary, or a tool for students to help them learn.   *Monte Carlo is for problems that aren't in a textbook.*\n\n## Comment ID kppf5q0 with +3 score by [(xhitcramp, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kppf5q0/) (in reply to ID 1amy1gh):\nIt takes about 77.5 billion iterations to check every battleship board layout.

It's useful, and I use it a lot because it's effective for what I need to compute. I think my applications are interesting, because I'd change jobs if I didn't think it was interesting.\n\nThe whole point of it is that it can give me a calculation that is intractable by analytical calculation. I have a pretty solid background in statistics (certainly less than others but much more than most), and I can do a pretty nice job of coming up with a slick analytical calculation for some pretty tough problems. Sometimes though, it's just not possible, or at least beyond my ability, or just too time consuming to attempt. When those problems arise I can use a Monte Carlo approach, and suddenly I don't have to worry so much about conjugate priors, parameter covariances, correlated variables, etc.\n\nInstead, I just build a model of the physical system I care about (this can be arbitrarily complicated, like a ray trace model of the Hubble Space Telescope), and randomly perturb some parameters and measure some outputs, a million times over. Boom. I have an answer to my question, with the full accuracy of the physical model, without a PhD thesis effort to build a valid analytical model of the whole mess.\n\n## Comment ID kpq9y5r with +2 score by [(archpawn, Reddit, 2024-02-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kpq9y5r/) (in reply to ID 1amy1gh):\n[Relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/2042/)\n\n## Comment ID kpqwryu with +2 score by [(Aurhim, Reddit, 2024-02-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kpqwryu/) (in reply to ID 1amy1gh):\nI like to pretend that its name is the \"Monte Christo\" method, and that it is out for revenge against all the other integration methods that wronged it (Riemann sums, the trapezoid rule, Simpson's rule, etc.).\n\n## Comment ID kpov55d with +2 score by [(RightProfile0, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kpov55d/) (in reply to ID 1amy1gh):\nThe answer is, It's not very interesting but rather essential tools in computing\n\n## Comment ID kpory5m with +1 score by [(Integralcel, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kpory5m/) (in reply to ID 1amy1gh):\nW question\n\n### Comment ID kpoy78v with +7 score by [(WWWWWWVWWWWWWWVWWWWW, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kpoy78v/) (in reply to ID kpory5m):\nW answer:\n\nOP chose the simplest possible case, so of course it feels elementary.

Right now, we know general/Newtonian physics and then things get more hairy from there once our object of study becomes smaller. If we precisely knew, or at least the equations of, every possible chemical reactions down to the most granular level of matter, then we can predict everything in theory. \n\nBut even then just knowing the equation does not give the formula for the solutions, let alone existence directly. All the deterministic methods we have, i.e., numerical methods, usually require us to know enough about the equation to make reasonable approximations. However, when we do not even know the equations and all we have is just observations, then the Monte Carlo methods can help us. \n\nIt's not clear from the simple coin toss example but it's evident when you learn just a little bit of Reinforcement Learning. The big breakthrough that RL brought us in the field of AI stuff like beating Chess, Go, Starcraft, Dota, or Protein folding, self-driving cars are all founded on that simple idea of *repeatedly sampling from your environment* until you learn enough. Note that I am entirely discarding more traditional areas like numerical integration, but that's not to mean MC was not helpful there. \n\nIt's a bit simplistic but if we take the existence or invention of computers granted, then we owe much of modern scientific advances on modern AI to that silly little idea of \"flipping a coin bunch of times.\"\n\n## Comment ID kpr8q61 with +1 score by [(512165381, Reddit, 2024-02-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kpr8q61/) (in reply to ID 1amy1gh):\nApplications\n\n- it can be used in calculus https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_integration\n\n- it IS used in quantitative finance https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_methods_in_finance\n\n- it IS used in pricing financial options https://blog.skz.dev/monte-carlo-options-pricing\n\n> Have people not been doing it for millennia?\n\nProbably, but now we do it via computer.\n\n## Comment ID kprbudd with +1 score by [(gutshog, Reddit, 2024-02-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kprbudd/) (in reply to ID 1amy1gh):\nthis math not mathmemes\n\n## Comment ID kprkejh with +1 score by [(tpn86, Reddit, 2024-02-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kprkejh/) (in reply to ID 1amy1gh):\nThe price of a financial asset is an expectation.

Isn't it an utterly trivial observation? Why is it named after Dirichlet? Surely people know about it before? Well, it's not named after him before he's the first one to discover it; it's named after him because he's the first one to use it in an interesting way to solve a difficult problem: proving Dirichlet's unit theorem. Sure, once phrased in the right context, the method become obvious, but what's not obvious is using it in that particular case.\n\nSame here. The interesting thing here is that Ulam is using it to solve the problem of estimating an integral, which was not obvious before. Of course, the method in generality must have been used before, but it's not an obvious idea to apply it in this scenario. As far as I know, there are no records of ancient people using dart throw to estimate the area of a geometric object."

Monte Carlo focuses on what matters rather than what they think should matter based on some YC blog they read.\n2. Monte Carlo actually has a natural work-life balance because 1) they can avoid burnout this way and 2) most folks have kids at home. This means no Sunday 11pm emails, no calls scheduled after 6pm, etc. \n3. Monte Carlo is obsessed with solving a HUGE problem with a monumental TAM (Snowflake-sized) because anyone that uses a cloud-based data warehouse has a problem trusting their data. \n\nAs a result, Monte Carlo can provide best-in-class benefits (because we've raised a lot of VC from best-in-class investors), hire the best people, and work with the most data-first companies in the ecosystem. Creating and owning a new category that other companies like Datadog (market cap of $35B) and Snowflake (market cap of $80B) will eventually step into is also very satisfying. \n\nFinally, having a woman as CEO that is not some 25 year old wunderkid out of Stanford/MIT/Harvard means diversity, equity, and inclusion starts at the top. We can recruit some of the best talent (1:1 female to male ratio currently) because our culture is actually inclusive and not full of 26 year old white guys from SoMa/The Marina.",

Monte Carlo focuses on what matters rather than what they think should matter based on some YC blog they read.\n2. Monte Carlo actually has a natural work-life balance because 1) they can avoid burnout this way and 2) most folks have kids at home. This means no Sunday 11pm emails, no calls scheduled after 6pm, etc. \n3. Monte Carlo is obsessed with solving a HUGE problem with a monumental TAM (Snowflake-sized) because anyone that uses a cloud-based data warehouse has a problem trusting their data. \n\nAs a result, Monte Carlo can provide best-in-class benefits (because we've raised a lot of VC from best-in-class investors), hire the best people, and work with the most data-first companies in the ecosystem. Creating and owning a new category that other companies like Datadog (market cap of $35B) and Snowflake (market cap of $80B) will eventually step into is also very satisfying. \n\nFinally, having a woman as CEO that is not some 25 year old wunderkid out of Stanford/MIT/Harvard means diversity, equity, and inclusion starts at the top. We can recruit some of the best talent (1:1 female to male ratio currently) because our culture is actually inclusive and not full of 26 year old white guys from SoMa/The Marina.",

      "# [Tsitsipas sweeps aside Ruud to win Monte Carlo Masters for the third time, and then weeps on 2024-04-14](https://apnews.com/article/monte-carlo-masters-tsitsipas-tears-ruud-0d4de57f60a1d4a3914568dca364f7ef)\nMONACO (AP) — Stefanos Tsitsipas swept aside Casper Ruud 6-1, 6-4 on Sunday to win the clay-court Monte Carlo Masters for the third time in four years, and then wept in his chair.\n\nTsitsipas sat holding his head in his hands, briefly crying as he took in his first title of the year and biggest tournament victory for two years.\n\n“I’m very proud of myself today. I had been waiting for a moment like this for a long time,” said the 12th-ranked Tsitsipas, who reached a career-high No. 3 ranking in 2021. “I did not know what was going to happen this week.”\n\nThe big-serving Greek also won the title in 2021 and 2022 and this latest trophy at the Monte Carlo Country Club took him to 11 career titles overall.\n\n“It has been very difficult, so to be back on the podium, winning tournaments, just feels amazing,” Tsitsipas said. “The third time is even more special than the first or second time. This is an unbelievable win for me. Capturing that win today was nerve-wracking, I really wanted this trinity.”\n\nIt was his first trophy since August last year, when he won a modest ATP 250-level tournament on outdoor hard courts at Los Cabos in Mexico.\n\nThis was much more prestigious and he shared a warm hug at the net with Ruud, who is chasing his first title of the year and remains stuck on 10 overall.\n\nThe match featured former French Open runner-ups and offered an early indication of form heading into the clay-court major at next month’s Roland Garros.\n\nTsitsipas was an outsider coming into this tournament, where he was seeded 12th.\n\nBut he got the better of Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner in the semifinals, handing him only his second defeat of the season to set up a perhaps unexpected final against Ruud, who beat top-ranked Novak Djokovic in Saturday’s other semi.\n\nTsitsipas took an early control.\n\nHe broke Ruud’s serve and held for 3-1, then secured another break of serve when eighth-seeded Ruud flapped a loose forehand into the net from the back of the court. A nervous-looking Ruud double-faulted on set point.\n\nRuud improved in the second set and pressured Tsitsipas, who saved three break points and took 13 minutes to hold serve in a tough seventh game.\n\nThat seemed to be Ruud’s last chance while also summing up his erratic match, where he made too many unforced errors and failed to convert any of his eight break-point chances.\n\nTsitsipas hit an ace to win his next service game, leaving Ruud needing to hold serve to stay in the match.\n\nAn unforced error at 30-30 saw Ruud patting a straightforward-looking backhand long to offer Tsitsipas a first match point.\n\nHe seized the moment.\n\nTsitsipas dominated a brief rally and clinched victory with a forehand winner, then slid on his back with his arms outstretched and put his hands on his face.\n\n“I managed the point relatively well and finished it with the winner,” Tsitsipas said. “I showed some ruthless tennis. From the beginning to the end, my play was cohesive.”\n\nTsitsipas will improve to No. 7 when the ATP rankings are released on Monday.\n\n___",

      "# [Accessing Math Solutions via Monte Carlo Self-Refine with LLaMa-3 8B](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40659322)\nI am confused about how the MCTSr algorithm actually is. It is not clear how it is better than simply mutating potential answers (by LLM) and sorting by LLM self-eval.\n\nI have a hard time understanding how many LLM evals MCTSr actually does. How the rollout limit is implemented is not described at all. It doesn't seem like it can mean the same thing as for normal MCTS because there is not any definitive \"end\" to the tree search. Additionally, MCTS is normally limited by the nodes expanded.\n\nAside from theoretical concerns, it is not clear why they have not include an > 8 rollout version in the tables or used an LLM stronger than Llama 3 8B. If the concept scales well it should be able to beat GPT-4 and friends by a rather large margin.\n\nObviously marrying search with LLMs is a ripe area for research, but I find it hard to actually take anything away from this paper.\n\nEDIT:\n\nAdded a missing greater than sign\n\nTwo differences in MCTS (or their MCTSr) from what you describe: First is that using just the self-eval as an authoritative score rather than a probability distribution increases the likelihood that a low-quality evaluation (a.k.a. an inaccurate evaluation) will throw off the entire search process. Second is that by using MCTS, a low-quality action (MCTSr -> solution) that doesn't turn out to be low-quality until several refinement rounds doesn't throw off the entire search, either, since the tree search can go back to the root and experiment with a different earlier branch.\n\nA single rollout is the full process described in chapter 3. \"The algorithm iterates through these stages until a termination condition T is met, including rollout constraints or maximum exploration depth\"\n\nI can't say as to why they didn't try using a bigger model than Llama 3 8B, or more rollouts.\n\n[edit] counter-edit\n\n> They did include an 8-rollout version in the tables? I can't say as to why they didn't try using a bigger model than Llama 3 8B.\n\nThat was a typo. I meant a > 8 rollout version. It doesn't seem like they have hit massively diminishing returns yet.\n\n> A single rollout is the full process described in chapter 3. \"The algorithm iterates through these stages until a termination condition T is met, including rollout constraints or maximum exploration depth\"\n\nA rollout is not the entire process. The summary of normal MCTS correctly identifies rollouts as \"random simulations by selecting moves arbitrarily until a game’s conclusion is reached, thereby evaluating the node’s potential\". Nothing actually like rollouts is ever described.\n\nTypically MCTS is limited by nodes expanded which is likely what they mean, but because they correctly described rollouts, it seems like I am missing something. Also they mention AlphaGo which replaces rollouts with a neural eval which maybe is relevant.\n\nIf rollouts means nodes expanded, 4 and 8 are both just really low numbers.",

      "# [Monte-Carlo graph search from first principles](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39662698)\nThis looks too low level.\n\nWhat might be a step forward is a joint learning of the state representation with the search algorithm. Search algorithm explores the NN representation of the state for which you can get the cost.\n\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/genie-2024/\n\nGenie from DeepMind is a good demonstration where discrete state is being modeled. NN learns a very complex representation with collision detection and actions. Instead of decoding that state into pixels, search could probably be done directly on that state.\n\nOf course, this architecture could be very different.\n\nAn over-simplified approach that would be interesting to explore:\n\n1. Given a collection of logical arguments, figure out how to assign a hash to each argument.\n\n2. Build a Merkle tree representing the argument's hashes, nesting according to first principles.\n\n3. If an argument is challenged successfully, the argument's hash changes, rendering descendent argument hashes invalid.\n\nIt's technically a different algorithm just under the same \"monte carlo\" name.\n\nHowever something interesting of note is that since most applications of monte carlo methods rely on PRNGs instead of true RNGs, they are technically deterministic (as given the same PRNG seed you should always get the same result for a given input).\n\nSo what this algorithm is doing instead of using a normal PRNG and a separate heuristic, is to instead query the neural network. This works because the neural net is an heuristic over a massive search space which ends up acting like a very poor PRNG that is heavily biased towards specific results based on the training of the neutal net, which in turn ends up looking like a PRNG with a set of heuristics applied.\n\nThe important thing to note is that this is a specialisation of MCTS and as such shouldn't technically work for all use cases.\n\nWhen we make game-playing AI (which is all AI, depending on your analogy comfort), one of the most promising techniques is Tree Search, which ranks moves based on the descendant moves. In games where you could reach the same state in many ways, much memory might be wasted to re-record the same state node on different branches.\n\nThis article is a nice exploration of an approach called Graph Search, which essentially trades compute for memory by doing extra compute work (hashing the game states) to check to see if the nodes are already visited. That saves us from re-recording nodes we already saw, and consequently converts trees (free of cycles) into directed acyclic graphs.\n\nThis forces some tinkering with the tree search to get correct results, specifically it demands a focus more on edges (actions or moves) as the unit of optimization, rather than on vertices (states). It’s a well written technical essay in literate programming written by someone who understands their subject.\n\nI would argue that this saves both compute and memory for any significant search. In a traditional tree-search without treating states as identical and revistable still requires you to store every node that you visit in memory to track the N, Q, and child relations.\n\nApplying the algorithm adds a hash associated with each node, and a counter on each edge. On the other side you're de-duplicating identical states in your search space, saving the memory of duplicate nodes but more importantly saving compute by not requiring independent searches of the same state space. Whether this trade off actually saves memory will be determined based on how likely duplicate states are in your search space.\n\nOtherwise your summary is absolutely spot on.",

      "# [Monte Carlo 2024: Reinsurer performance will lure capital – Guy Carpenter chair by Ben Dyson on 2024-09-10](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/monte-carlo-2024-reinsurer-performance-will-lure-capital-8211-guy-carpenter-chair-83251091)\nGood financial performance at reinsurance companies over the past 18 months should persuade investors to put more capital into the industry, according to David Priebe, chairman of reinsurance broker Guy Carpenter & Co. LLC. However, the flow of capital into the industry will continue to be modest, Priebe added.\n\nInvestors are continuing to see reinsurers show discipline on pricing and terms and conditions, and they recognize the changes reinsurers made to property-catastrophe pricing and structures in 2023.\n\n\"[These] have had a material effect on the return characteristics for the reinsurance industry, particularly in the property side,\" Priebe said in an interview with S&P Global Market Intelligence at the Rendez-Vous de Septembre reinsurance conference in Monte Carlo.\n\n\"I think investors are saying ... that it feels like a sustainable area to deploy capital,\" Priebe said. \"I think we'll continue to see some influx, albeit probably still at a moderate level.\"\n\nPriebe said the capital would mainly flow to existing reinsurers and noted that there still had not been \"any sort of material new-new capital coming into the business\" other than through the catastrophe bond market. He added: \"I think there may be some successful new [companies] coming in, but I think that will be more pointed towards the specialty insurance lines rather than purely reinsurance.\"\n\nNew companies were mooted around the time of the Monte Carlo Rendez-Vous last year after reinsurance trading conditions and returns improved, but none have yet launched.\n\nTalk of reinsurance startups has rekindled at this year's Monte Carlo Rendez-Vous. Insurance Insider recently reported that Mereo, chaired by former Ace and American International Group CEO Brian Duperreault, has secured a cornerstone investor. Just before the conference kicked off, Polo Managing Agency announced that Lloyd's of London had granted in-principle approval for a new reinsurance syndicate called Oak Re Syndicate 2843, which plans to start underwriting on Jan. 1, 2025.\n\nRoughly half of the world's reinsurance renews on Jan. 1 every year.\n\nStarting up in today's reinsurance market is challenging, Priebe said. \"You need to have meaningful capacity and capital to be impactful. So you need $1 billion-plus, if not $2 billion. And therefore, the stakes to entry have gone up from what it was five to 10 years ago.\"\n\nImproved profitability at existing reinsurers means they are generating capital to meet insurers' demand for the cover they offer. Priebe said Guy Carpenter's figures showed that after dividends and share buybacks, reinsurers collectively had $35 billion to redeploy on growth in 2023. This compares with approximately $30 billion of fresh demand for reinsurance from insurers in 2024, meaning supply and demand are broadly matching.\n\nReinsurers should be in for another profitable year in 2024, Priebe said, and while some might be more aggressive on dividends and share buybacks, \"net-net, I think you'll continue to see growth overall in the capital, which we think will continue to match demand.\"",

The Serbian, winner in 2013 and 2015, will meet the victor between France’s Arthur Fils and Italy’s Lorenzo Musetti who play their second round match later on Tuesday. Musetti defeated Djokovic at the third-round stage last year.\n\nHubert Hurkacz is into the second round with a 6-4, 3-6, 7-6(2) win, but was made to battle by Britain’s Jack Draper after the Polish 10th seed looked like dominating early on. Hurkacz raced into a 3-0 lead in the first set but Draper rallied to level at 4-4, before the Pole broke serve to take the opener.

Wawrinka won the title in 2014, but a decade later the Swiss 39-year-old was no match for the Australian 11th seed, who needed only 24 minutes to complete a bagel in the second set, and will face Tallon Griekspoor.\n\nSebastian Korda also eased into the second round with a 6-1, 6-2 win over Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, finalist in 2022, but will face a much stiffer test when he takes on the world No 2 Jannik Sinner in the next round. “Obviously, he’s probably the best tennis player in the world right now,” Korda said in advance of meeting the Australian Open champion. “He’s had an unbelievable season and it’s going to be our first meeting on the clay. I’m just going to try to go out there, try my best, and see what happens.”\n\nCarlos Alcaraz, the third seed, has withdrawn from the tournament with an arm injury, and his second round place was taken by the lucky loser Lorenzo Sonego, who will play Felix Auger-Aliassime. Alcaraz may also have an eye on his preparation for the French Open, which begins on 20 May.\n\n“I have been working in Monte Carlo and trying to recover until the last minute from an injured pronator teres in my right arm, but it was not possible and I cannot play,” Alcaraz posted on social media. “I was really looking forward to playing.
