      "# [Delivering End-to-End Data Trust with Snowflake and Monte Carlo by Scott O'Leary on 2021-04-29](https://www.montecarlodata.com/blog-snowflake/)\nAs companies increasingly leverage data-driven insights to drive innovation and maintain their competitive edge, it’s important that this data is accurate and reliable. With Monte Carlo and Snowflake’s strategic partnership, teams can finally trust their data through end-to-end Data Observability and automated lineage of their entire data ecosystem, all the way down to field-level values.\n\nHas your CEO ever told you that the numbers in a report you showed her looked way off?\n\nHas a customer ever called out errors in your product’s dashboards?\n\nWhat about a rise in a field’s null rate that went unnoticed for days or weeks because there wasn’t a noticeable change in your KPIs?\n\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, you’re not alone. Data downtime, in other words, periods of time when data is missing, inaccurate, or otherwise erroneous, is an all-too-familiar reality for even the best data teams, costing them millions of dollars in wasted revenue and up to 50 percent of the data engineering team’s time that could otherwise be spent moving the needle for the business.\n\nTo help companies trust their data, Monte Carlo is excited to announce our partnership with Snowflake by bringing our automated Data Observability Platform to the Data Cloud. Data teams relying on Snowflake to derive critical insights about their business can now leverage the power of automated anomaly detection, monitoring, and end-to-end lineage to prevent bad data from affecting downstream consumers.\n\nAchieving reliable Snowflake pipelines with data observability\n\nThe Snowflake – Monte Carlo integration makes it easy for data organizations to identify, resolve, and prevent data downtime and data quality issues before they impact the business, giving companies confidence in the reliability of their data and the products they power.\n\nWith this partnership, Snowflake customers can now:\n\nAchieve end-to-end Data Observability without writing any code. Get end-to-end data observability for your Snowflake data pipelines with a 20-minute, no-code implementation process. Access out-of-the-box visibility into data Freshness, Volume, Distribution, Schema, and Lineage just by plugging Monte Carlo into your Data Cloud.\n\nKnow when data breaks, as soon as it happens. Monte Carlo continuously monitors your Snowflake assets and proactively alerts stakeholders to data issues. Monte Carlo’s machine learning-first approach gives data teams broad coverage for common data issues with minimal configuration, and business-context-specific checks layered on top ensure you’re covered at each stage of your data pipeline.\n\nFind the root cause of data quality issues, fast. Monte Carlo gives teams a single pane of glass to investigate data issues, drastically reducing time to resolution. By bringing all information and context for your pipelines into one place, teams spend less time firefighting data issues and more time improving the business.\n\nImmediately understand the business impact of bad data. End-to-end lineage for your pipelines from the point it enters Snowflake (or further upstream!) down to the analytics and business intelligence layer, data teams are able to assess the business impact of their data issues, ultimately preventing decision making based on bad data.\n\nPrevent data downtime. Give your teams full visibility into your Snowflake pipelines and how they impact downstream reports and dashboards to make more informed development decisions. With Monte Carlo, teams can better manage breaking changes to ELTs and BI assets by knowing what will be impacted and who to notify.\n\nIn addition to supporting existing mutual customers, Monte Carlo provides end-to-end, automated coverage for teams migrating from their legacy stacks to the Snowflake Data Cloud Platform. Moreover, Monte Carlo’s security-first approach to Data Observability ensures that data never leaves your Snowflake environment.\n\nWhat Monte Carlo and Snowflake customers have to say\n\nThe Zebra\n\nThe Zebra, a leading insurance comparison site, makes it easy for consumers across the United States to compare and save on car and home insurance quotes. The company provides over 1,800 car insurance products from more than 200 national insurers, a monumental feat that relies on real-time decision making powered by data from disparate third-party vendors and partners. The Zebra’s data team uses Snowflake and Monte Carlo to ensure that their data pipelines are performant and reliable.\n\n“As a data leader, there’s nothing worse than not being able to trust your data,” said Shea Spalding, Head of Data Governance at The Zebra. “The combination of Snowflake’s data cloud and Monte Carlo’s data observability platform helps ensure that our data is accessible and fresh at each stage of the data life cycle. With this stack, my team can better collaborate to resolve issues, work towards data trust, and build better products for our customers.”\n\nMindbody\n\nAs the world’s leading wellness services marketplace, Mindbody is a company with data at heart. Alex Soria, VP of Data & Analytics, is leading the charge with a team of over 25 data scientists, business intelligence analysts, and data engineers responsible for ensuring that the insights powering their product is fresh and reliable.\n\nAs the world’s leading wellness services marketplace, Mindbody is a company with data at heart. Alex Soria, VP of Data & Analytics, is leading the charge with a team of over 25 data scientists, business intelligence analysts, and data engineers responsible for ensuring that the insights powering their product is fresh and reliable.\n\n“Data-driven decision making is a huge priority for Mindbody, but our analytics are only as reliable as the data that informs them,” said Alex. “We are working with Monte Carlo to monitor and alert for abnormalities in our Snowflake pipelines, such as null values and duplicate data, that would otherwise go unnoticed until it’s too late. By partnering with Snowflake and Monte Carlo, my team can achieve more powerful analytics and full data reliability.”\n\nCollaborative Imaging\n\nCollaborative Imaging is a radiologist-owned alliance dedicated to improving the lives of physicians and patients everywhere through technology. With over 18,000 patients seen per day and nearly 1M radiological exams read per month, the alliance is charting a course for the future of this industry by giving providers the solutions and processes necessary to better serve their communities.\n\nTo power their business, Collaborative Imaging needs fast analytics powered by clean and reliable data, which is no easy feat given the size and scope of their distributed data ecosystem. To gain greater visibility into the health of their data at each stage of its life cycle, they needed a way to understand how data flows into their data warehouse, as well as be alerted when changes occur in schema or distribution of the many data sources which are ingested into their Snowflake data warehouse. Monte Carlo empowered them to troubleshoot and resolve issues before downstream data consumers are impacted.\n\n“Collaborative Imaging’s analytics platform helps physicians and patients connect the dots between disparate data points in their healthcare journey, but our insights are only as reliable as the data feeding our system. Dirty data is a landmark of healthcare analytics, and a lot of the work we do revolves around cleaning and making sense of this data to put it into one repository,” said Jacob. “Combined with Snowflake’s powerful Data Cloud and Monte Carlo’s Data Observability Platform, we can resolve these problems before they reach the business. My executives are happy and I can trust our data.”\n\nWant to learn more about how data observability can help you trust your data?

This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our Services.\n\nInformation Collected Automatically\n\nWhen you interact with our Services as a website visitor or employee of a customer, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, geolocation data, device identification, “cookie” information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. This may include information about your online activity after you leave our Services. To learn more about this type of data collection, please review our Cookie Policy.\n\nWe may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns. We may also use it to improve the Services. For example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible.\n\nInformation Provided by Others:\n\nOur customers, business partners and service providers may provide us with information about you. Customers may provide us the names and business emails of their employees to help us to create accounts for those individuals, as well as Personal Information of their own customers. If as a customer, you access our Services through a third-party service, or connect an application to our Service, that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to Monte Carlo.\n\nWe Combine Information\n\nWe may combine information that we have collected offline with information we collect online. We combine information that we have collected across other third party sites. We combine information across devices, such as computers and mobile devices. We may also combine information we get from a third party with information we already have.\n\nWill Company Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives?\n\nMonte Carlo does not and will not sell your Personal Information. We may, however, share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this section:\n\nVendors/Subprocessors: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and may need to share your Personal Information with them to provide the Services to you, which may include for the creation and maintenance of accounts, collection and analysis of data, provision of technical support, or provision of specific business services such as synchronization with other software applications and marketing services. Vendors and Subprocessors are permitted to use the Personal Information we share with them only as necessary to assist us in the provision of the Services and are required by written agreement not to retain, use or disclose your Personal Information for any other purpose.\n\nBusiness Transfers: We may choose to buy or sell assets or our company and may share and/or transfer customer information in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.\n\nProtection of Company and Others: We may access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our terms and conditions and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety and security of Monte Carlo, our employees, our users, or others.\n\nSecurity Of Your Personal Information\n\nWe use a variety of industry-standard security measures to help protect your Personal Information as required by relevant law. We also require you to enter a password to access your account information. Please do not disclose your account password to unauthorized persons. Although we are committed to protecting your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Additionally, our customers and your employer must prevent unauthorized access to accounts and Personal Information by selecting and protecting passwords appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser.\n\nHow Is My Personal Information Retained?\n\nWe keep Personal Information as long as it is necessary or relevant for the purposes for which it was collected and in compliance with our retention policies. We also keep information as otherwise required by law.\n\nTo determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider not only applicable legal requirements, but also the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Information, the purposes for which we process your Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means.\n\nWhat Choices Do I Have Regarding My Personal Information?\n\nYou can choose not to disclose Personal Information to us, but keep in mind that if you are a customer or an employee of a customer, some Personal Information may be needed to register with us or to take advantage of some of our Service features.\n\nTo stop receiving our promotional emails follow the instructions in any promotional message you get from us or contact us as described at the end of this Privacy Policy. If you opt out of getting marketing messages, you will continue to receive messages from us about your relationship with us where permitted by law.\n\nYou may request deletion of your information or account by sending a request to privacy@montecarlodata.com. If you are an employee of one of our customers, we will refer your request to that Monte Carlo customer. Some information may remain in our records after your deletion request.\n\nYou can control cookies and tracking tools. To learn how we - and our vendors - use cookies and other tracking tools, and to read our Do Not Track policy, please click here.\n\nYour Legal Rights Regarding Your Personal Information\n\nUnder certain circumstances you may have rights under applicable data protection laws in relation to your Personal Information. Where applicable, you may have the right to:\n\nRequest information about how we collect, process, use and share your Personal Information (commonly known as a “right to know request”).\n\nRequest access to your Personal Data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.\n\nRequest correction of the Personal Information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.\n\nRequest erasure of your Personal Information (commonly known as a “request to be forgotten”). This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Information. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your Personal Information to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply in full with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.\n\nObject to processing of your Personal Information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.\n\nRequest restriction of processing of your Personal Information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Information in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.\n\nRequest the transfer of your Personal Information to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.\n\nWithdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain Services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.\n\nIf you wish to exercise any of the above rights please contact privacy@montecarlodata.com. You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of the other rights), and Monte Carlo does not discriminate based on whether you choose to exercise your choice and rights. We will not, based on your exercise of rights, deny our Services to you, charge you different rates, provide a different level or quality of Services to you, or suggest that you may receive such different treatment. However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.\n\nAdditionally, we may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. As part of the verification process, we match the information submitted as part of your request against information stored by Monte Carlo. In some instances, we will require additional information in order to verify your request. If an authorized third party makes a data subject request on your behalf, we will require sufficient written proof that you have designated them as your authorized agent. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within 30 days. Occasionally it may take us longer than 30 days if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.\n\nCalifornia Residents’ Rights\n\nSubject to certain limitations, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides California consumers the right to request to know more details about the categories or specific pieces of Personal Information we collect (including how we use and disclose this information), to delete their Personal Information, to opt out of any “sales” that may be occurring, and to not be discriminated against for exercising these rights. If you are a resident of California (or another jurisdiction that provides comparable rights) and would like to make a request, please contact us 548 Market Street, PMB 59994, San Francisco, CA 94104 or via email at privacy@montecarlodata.com. If you are submitting on someone else’s behalf, we may ask for additional information to verify your identity. This may include providing a signed letter verifying your right to make this request. We do not sell Personal Information to third parties for money or any other consideration, as that term is generally understood. We do not sell Personal Information of minors under the age of 16. We will not discriminate against you because you have exercised any of your rights under the CCPA.\n\nFor EU, UK and Swiss Residents\n\nIf Personal Information pertaining to you as an individual has been submitted to the Services by or on behalf of one of our customers and you wish to exercise any data protection rights you may have in respect of that data under applicable law, including (as applicable) the right to access, port, correct, amend or delete such data, please inquire with the relevant Monte Carlo customer directly.

I know exactly how you might feel w your MC (like how I did my first one).\n\nWhat you are experiencing is mostly likely \"melting\" when plants transition to a new environment. I'm assuming from tissue culture to dry start. Completely normal. During melting there will be some yellowing or browning or even dieback but once you are passed that stage you should see better growth.\n\nThe first 3 weeks, generally speaking you would see minimal growth as the MC is just busy establishing good root system. I find around week4-5 is the bigger growth and spread.\n\nIn terms of misting, depending on your climate. You may have to mist 4-5 times in dry arid climate, and less if humid (around x1-2 a day). Just make sure not too \"wet\" (make sure the soil is not soaked and flooded).\n\nMake sure to open the plastic wrap for 10-15min each day to let air exchange (mainly CO2) to help the growth. Or you can just fold the corner of the plastic wrap the whole time to let small gap for air exchange (smaller gap if you live in dry climate).\n\nIf you do run into mould/fungus, again dont panic, they are naturally occurring in nature. The key is to \"control\" the growth of mould/fungus instead of \"eradicating\" it. You can mix hydrogen peroxide and water 1:4 ratio and spray it on affected area daily. Or spot treat it. Once your dry start MC outgrows the mould/fungus, you have \"won\" against mould/fungus. And oh mould/fungus wouldnt survive when you flood the tank anyways.\n\nMinimum dry start is 3 weeks, you can flood it after 3 weeks or more (I did mine on day 95 to make sure good carpet coverage).\n\nWhen you eventually flood your tank expect another melting episode. What people generally do is trim the top layer of MC (dont worry it should grow back because the root system is optimal now).\n\nBe patient,good luck and enjoy the dry start journey.\n\n### Comment ID he0bzzi with +2 score by [(nordicengineers, Reddit, 2021-09-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Aquascape/comments/pkt2md/drystart_monte_carlo_not_growing_very_well/he0bzzi/) (in reply to ID hc5ywtx):\n/u/Tough_Branch4062 My one month update is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Aquascape/comments/pu46et/update_my_20cm_cube_drystart_4_weeks_later/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf).

But what I'm unsure of is how the scientific community became convinced that it works and produces useful results. I tried doing my own research but I can't find any arguments for *why* it works, just how it works and how to do it. \n\nOur relatively elementary model we use at work takes a matrix of 10,000 economic scenarios (with Treasury curves, credit spreads, equity returns, and other variables for each scenario) generated by a vendor solution, calculates the financial impact of each scenario on the company, and spits out a 1x10,000 distribution of those financial impacts. This distribution is always pretty close to a normal distribution, every time we update it with new information. Should we be concerned that it's always such a nicely behaved normal distribution? Did we unintentionally cook it up to behave like this? Is this a feature of Monte Carlo? Do MC models ever not \"converge\" like this?

Imagine a normal distribution with mean 10 and sd 2. If I asked you to give me the probability that a parameter with the above distribution falls within the range 5-10, how would you compute this value? Since the normal distribution is a probability distribution which sums to 1, you would need to integrate (i.e. find the area of) the distribution from 5 to 10. You can do this using calculus. \n\n\nHowever, what if you did not know calculus? Using MC, you could randomly generate a large number of values from a normal distribution with mean 10 and sd 2, and then compute the proportion of randomly generated values that are within the range from 5 to 10. As the number of random samples that you generate nears infinity, the proportion of samples falling within the range 5-10 will approach the true analytical solution (i.e. the integral found using calculus). This happens, intuitively, because the more random samples you generate, the closer your samples are to a true normal distribution. \n\n\nEDIT: The normal distribution does not have an exact closed form solution for definite integrals, so it was a bad example. That said, the intuition still applies!\n\n### Comment ID dp5hbpd with +5 score by [(None, Reddit, 2017-10-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/79rmqn/stupid_question_about_monte_carlo_how_do_we_know/dp5hbpd/) (in reply to ID dp4i75e):\n> Since the normal distribution is a probability distribution which sums to 1, you would need to integrate (i.e. find the area of) the distribution from 5 to 10.

Imagine your elementary model is a function of one variable f(x). Additionally, there is some probability distribution that reflects the uncertainty in x, I'll call p(x).\n\nIf you were simply interested in the mean of the output of your model, you could do the integral:\n\n    mu = integral(f(x)*p(x))\n\nThat integral may be difficult to calculate because f(x) may be slow to evaluate (or in your case high dimensional or whatever), so instead you can approximate it by sampling from p(x) and calculating the simple sample mean.\n\n    x_1, ..., x_m ~ p(x)\n    mu_hat = 1/m*sum(x_i)\n\nThis \"works\" because of the central limit theorem. \n\nNow you are probably way more used to using Monte Carlo and looking at a histogram of the output. Well each bin of a histogram is simply an integral. Each bin represents the probability that the  output f(x) falls into the bin when varying according to p(x). So the probability for bin j is just:\n\n    p_bin_j = integral( I(lower_j < f(x) < upper_j)*p(x))\n\nwhere I( ) is the indicator function.\n\nUsing Monte Carlo, you approximate this by sampling from p(x) and then calculating the fraction of values that fall in bin j. \n\n    x_1, ..., x_m ~ p(x)\n    mu_hat = 1/m*sum( I(lower_j < f(x_i) < upper_j) )\n\nIt also just works because of the Central Limit Theorem, a statistician's best friend. \n\nIn your case, you are sampling from a bunch of scenarios, which you can think of as x being your scenarios and p(x) being a distribution on the different scenarios. This may be high dimensional or otherwise hard to calculate, but the good thing about Monte Carlo is that it's convergence properties don't depend on the size of the \"x space\".\n\nThere are many reasons that your output might look pretty normally distributed. I can't help for diagnosing that.\n\nMonte Carlo will converge by simple CRT, but does assume you are sampling p(x) properly and that p(x) is the actual probability distribution you care about. Also, if your model is overly simple, then ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\n### Comment ID dp5az9s with +3 score by [(anonemouse2010, Reddit, 2017-10-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/79rmqn/stupid_question_about_monte_carlo_how_do_we_know/dp5az9s/) (in reply to ID dp4p4eh):\n> This \"works\" because of the central limit theorem.\n\nIt works because of the LLN... technically OMC 'works' even if the variance is infinite, for which the CLT doesn't apply.\n\n#### Comment ID dp5h3d3 with +1 score by [(grozzy, Reddit, 2017-10-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/79rmqn/stupid_question_about_monte_carlo_how_do_we_know/dp5h3d3/) (in reply to ID dp5az9s):\nYou are technically correct, though finite mean, infinite variance problems aren't the most common thing.\n\nTo me, connecting it with the Central Limit Theorem for cases with finite variance is more useful to someone getting an understanding, because the properties of the convergence of the MC estimate are intuitive with CLT.\n\nGood point though and I appreciate the response.\n\n## Comment ID dp4npyb with +9 score by [(berf, Reddit, 2017-10-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/79rmqn/stupid_question_about_monte_carlo_how_do_we_know/dp4npyb/) (in reply to ID 79rmqn):\nIt works for the same reason that elementary statistics works: the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem.

The Monte Carlo method is an approximation of transforming that distribution over economic scenarios into a distribution over financial impacts.\n\nIt's essentially applying general versions of the \"Law of Large Numbers\" (which is really just more general forms of the Central Limit Theorem) to make precise approximating a probability measure with random sampling. \n\n>This distribution is always pretty close to a normal distribution, every time we update it with new information. Should we be concerned that it's always such a nicely behaved normal distribution? Did we unintentionally cook it up to behave like this? \n\nIf you're doing Bayesian updating, and each economic scenario is generated from a posterior distribution, and you have tons of data, then it is not too surprising to see the normal distribution. In Bayesian models under sufficient conditions, the posterior distribution will converge to a normal distribution (over the parameters) as the sample size goes to infinity. So normal approximations to the posterior aren't uncommon when data is plentiful.\n\n## Comment ID dp4mtk4 with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2017-10-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/79rmqn/stupid_question_about_monte_carlo_how_do_we_know/dp4mtk4/) (in reply to ID 79rmqn):\nI always learned about it starting with buffon's needle.

Once you get into distributions with heterogeneous variance, or are combining distributions using more and more free parameters, or you try to take the square root of -1 or something ridiculous like that, than you're more and more likely to fail convergence. I'm guessing whoever designed your elementary model probably made enough assumptions that the underlying phenomena rely on normal distributions so that you won't need to worry about failing convergence, unless you reduce the # of scenarios.\n\n## Comment ID dp4ze2a with +2 score by [(stucchio, Reddit, 2017-10-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/79rmqn/stupid_question_about_monte_carlo_how_do_we_know/dp4ze2a/) (in reply to ID 79rmqn):\nMonte Carlo is just a quadrature rule. A quadrature rule is a rule for approxmating integral f(x) dP(x) by evaluating f(x) at a finite set of points, and summing them appropriately. \n\nFor 1-dimensional integrals, you have Simpson's Rule (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson's_rule ) and similar things. The problem with these quadrature rules is that the computation time they require is exponential in the number of dimensions (e.g. in the # of variables you describe). \n\nMonte Carlo is a different quadrature rule which has computation time O(accuracy^-2) in any number of dimensions. It can be proven to converge for any distribution satisfying the law of large numbers, central limit theorem, etc. Others have linked to proofs, so I won't. \n\nSo to say \"monte carlo works\", we're saying the following. Out there in the modeler's mind, there is a \"true\" probability distribution over economic scenarios. Then MEAN(1x10000 vector you generate) is an accurate approximation to the true integral over that entire probability distribution. \n\nThat's what monte carlo does. Does that answer your actual question, or are you actually asking something more like \"how do I know that this financial model accurately describes plausible real world futures?\"\n\n## Comment ID dp4n9ob with +1 score by [(__Cyber_Dildonics__, Reddit, 2017-10-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/79rmqn/stupid_question_about_monte_carlo_how_do_we_know/dp4n9ob/) (in reply to ID 79rmqn):\nMonte Carlo simulations solve integrals that can't be solved analytically.\n\nHow long do these simulations at your company take?\n\n## Comment ID dp4xqe8 with +1 score by [(mrtransisteur, Reddit, 2017-10-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/79rmqn/stupid_question_about_monte_carlo_how_do_we_know/dp4xqe8/) (in reply to ID 79rmqn):\nIf you want to get a feel for Monte Carlo algorithms, read this quick Wikipedia article on Atlantic City algorithms: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_City_algorithm\n\n### Comment ID dp4xqgp with +1 score by [(WikiTextBot, Reddit, 2017-10-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/79rmqn/stupid_question_about_monte_carlo_how_do_we_know/dp4xqgp/) (in reply to ID dp4xqe8):\n**Atlantic City algorithm**\n\nAn Atlantic City algorithm is a probabilistic polynomial time algorithm that answers correctly at least 75% of the time (or, in some versions, some other value greater than 50%).

So because I knew nothing, I took one set of winter tires, one set of rain tires and the rest of them was hard tires.\n\nNow, obviously that was an a mistake and half, lol. I was just sliding left to right on almost all the stages and running my only set of winter tires to the ground and basically having to struggle through the race with the absolutely worst tires I could imagine having.. \n\nAlso, since the game seems to have a fetish for fricking rain on each fricking stage, the hard tires were even more useless than before. Plus it seems that my windshield vipers have no rubber on them anymore, they ain't wiping anything off the windshield, ffs..\n\nI'm playing on season mode to escape all the management crap, because I've no time for that and I just want to 100% focus on the rallying itself. Why in gods name do I have to PERSONALLY PICK AND CHOOSE my tires?? Why can't I have an advisor or someone pick them and then have me change them if I want to?? Also if I go to the change tires menu and press auto-mount, it'll just throw on random tires, not taking the next upcoming stages into account at all.. Seriously why can't stuff like that be automated if wanted?? Almost made me quit the game for good, lol...\n\nThe only positive I can think of is the fact that when I ran over snow on hard tires, the losing of grip felt really similar to real life! Seriously freaked out a bit when I first did it, just like it did when I did in the real life!\n\nBut still, give us automated tire choice pleaseeee!!\n\n## Comment ID hhmhwoo with +10 score by [(Material_Soup6086, Reddit, 2021-10-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WRCTheGame/comments/qdhz2v/driving_the_montecarlo_rally_has_to_be_the_most/hhmhwoo/) (in reply to ID qdhz2v):\nI hate Monte Carlo, especially since it's in every game  and seems to be the rally you're forced to do every season.

Even if you pick the season mode to avoid all the boring crew management you still have to pick the tyres and I have the same problem as you. I just want to rally and have the game decide the best tyres for me. I don't want to have to do all this research about tyres and look at weather forecasts, which, like you say, are always bloody raining (and too many night stages imo). \n\nAs someone else has said as well, Monte-Carlo is the worst for this and seems to appear every time you do a season or career. In fact it's always the first rally every time I start and puts me in a bad mood and turns the game into a chore straight away.\n\n## Comment ID hhmhzc4 with +2 score by [(decoyj6g, Reddit, 2021-10-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WRCTheGame/comments/qdhz2v/driving_the_montecarlo_rally_has_to_be_the_most/hhmhzc4/) (in reply to ID qdhz2v):\nSome people want everything automated, some don't. Personally i like that i can choose tyres myself.

I'm 40 seconds ahead on the controller and lose all time advantages in the last rally despite ripping through it with great pace and no damage. Even on fresh tires I am behind as if I had worn tires. The snow section at the end is just silly with the AI destroying previous leads near the end. Ok snow tires. There is no intelligence on the track condition nor improvements to forecasts.

But, when you say “How **useful** is it **really**”, I look at higher difficulty activities, and my answer does change. It still does great damage, but you’ve got some hard trade offs. \n\nIt’s a melee catalyst, which is inherently less usable in higher difficulties. It’s a kinetic primary, so you’re sacrificing any subclass synergy or AoE for 10% more per shot damage.

Don’t let that discourage you though, it’s still a good option, is fun to use, and it definitely does make melee uptime significantly higher.\n\n### Comment ID l4u7mon with +1 score by [(VoliTheKing, Reddit, 2024-05-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1cvz4rl/just_got_the_monte_carlo_catalyst_looks_like_fun/l4u7mon/) (in reply to ID l4tv3dw):\n>ton of different ways to get melee back *fast*\n\n\nLike what?\n\n#### Comment ID l4ub7pg with +2 score by [(NotACommie24, Reddit, 2024-05-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1cvz4rl/just_got_the_monte_carlo_catalyst_looks_like_fun/l4ub7pg/) (in reply to ID l4u7mon):\nInto the fray, thread of warding, thread of fury, thread of transmutation, invigoration, absolution, font of vigor, melee kickstart, outreach, distribution, pugilist\n\n## Comment ID l4u2eoo with +1 score by [(cosm1c15, Reddit, 2024-05-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1cvz4rl/just_got_the_monte_carlo_catalyst_looks_like_fun/l4u2eoo/) (in reply to ID 1cvz4rl):\ni have a warlock build for it , if you want it i can dm you that , its not meta , but its defo fun\n\n## Comment ID l4u7n4y with +1 score by [(trunglefever, Reddit, 2024-05-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1cvz4rl/just_got_the_monte_carlo_catalyst_looks_like_fun/l4u7n4y/) (in reply to ID 1cvz4rl):\nIt actually does a lot of damage and it gives you a healthy amount of melee energy back, it's definitely worth using and once you get used to using it and knowing when, it's an incredible weapon for melee builds.\n\n## Comment ID l4ukham with +1 score by [(LoneWolfNine, Reddit, 2024-05-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1cvz4rl/just_got_the_monte_carlo_catalyst_looks_like_fun/l4ukham/) (in reply to ID 1cvz4rl):\nThe Krieg will go charging into the Witness!\n\n## Comment ID l4ukjmt with +1 score by [(Arxiah, Reddit, 2024-05-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1cvz4rl/just_got_the_monte_carlo_catalyst_looks_like_fun/l4ukjmt/) (in reply to ID 1cvz4rl):\nYou can get up to about 600k damage per stab with things like Wormgod caress.\nThat'll one bang most targets outside of whole bosses.\nIt's super fun and just takes a bit of timer management to keep up indefinitely.\nI love it.\nAlso the about 50% melee energy per stab is very useful.\n\n## Comment ID l4upch8 with +1 score by [(SourceNo2702, Reddit, 2024-05-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1cvz4rl/just_got_the_monte_carlo_catalyst_looks_like_fun/l4upch8/) (in reply to ID 1cvz4rl):\nIt would be great if primary wasn’t so ass.

It needs a major rework. Make it count as a charged melee, make it only be usable once per charge and make it actually refund your energy.

Probably fine in 6's where you can flank and surprise people, but when you're more focused on 1v1's you might leave a lot of people with a sliver.     \n    \nI prefer to focus everything around getting the first kill, not what will help 3-4 kills later.

I've found monte carlo to be very resilient and easy to grow. I usually go with individual stalks planted at equal distances and if they're already in their submersed form and your tank conditions are appropriate, you'll start seeing new growth within the week. By 2 weeks you'll start to see them creep. \n\nOf course don't take the timeline as the gospel truth, more like a guideline as each tank is different. Yours may very well grow much faster than what I've experienced or may even be slower. What's important is, as long as they don't all melt away or get overrun with algae, you'll have a good chance of them carpeting the substrate.\n\n### Comment ID ihsjr6n with +14 score by [(jonnytsunamiii, Reddit, 2022-07-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantedTank/comments/w90b8p/help_will_my_monte_carlo_grow_in_if_planted_like/ihsjr6n/) (in reply to ID ihsi13m):\nThat's reassuring, thank you!

I have since moved and no longer have this layout. But I did learn a few things:\n\nThe dry start worked for the most part. I wasn't 100% successful though. My rock layout inhibited growth in certain places. If I was to do it over again, I'd use less rocks and go for a more classic iwagumi layout. \n\nI was living alone at the time and had a 9-5, plus personal activities afterwards. I had dry areas that died off and also mold, oddly. Maybe if I had my now wife help maintain it every few hours, with spraying and letting in fresh air, it would have been more successful. \n\nIt did carpet in most places, but my final worst mistake was introducing my Corydoras to the tank. Not sure if I did it too early, or even at all, but they tore up the plants and displaced everything. If I was to do it again, I'd never add them. (I still have them because they kick up all the crap on the floor and it gets sent to my intake tube. Haven't had to manual vacuum my current tank at all)\n\nAnyway, sorry for the sad update. In a nutshell, it works, but having regular maintenance, the right hardscape layout, and the right fish will definitely lead to good results.\n\n#### Comment ID l6o2lmo with +1 score by [(Cet-Ki, Reddit, 2024-06-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantedTank/comments/w90b8p/help_will_my_monte_carlo_grow_in_if_planted_like/l6o2lmo/) (in reply to ID l6nvm95):\nThank for your update!

I've spent a few hours and have not made much progress. Anyone have a recommendation for a computer that you love or have been eyeing? We can drop some serious cash on this, but not looking to build a computer.

For a gaming computer, you need your device to have fast communication between CPUs, memory, SSD and graphics card. For CPU-based numerics, you just need the cores and sufficient memory to store what you need (this can be a lot if you're working with large matrices). So the architecture of numerics machines is much more optimized towards this purpose.\n\nIs there not someone at your university who is in charge of running a local cluster/supercomputer?

Depending on the scale of these simulations, you want supercomputer time. If your simulations are rather small, just put a server with a really nice CPU and lots of RAM in a data center somewhere. Use a normal laptop or desktop, connect to the system through the network. This means you don't have to lug around a huge, unnecessarily powerful laptop and don't have to deal with noisy cooling systems heating up your workplace. An additional advantage is that computing servers run 24h a day, making it really easy to run simulations overnight or for several days, and multiple people can use the same system for their simulations.\n\n### Comment ID godfpyn with +1 score by [(classroom6, Reddit, 2021-02-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/lprxap/computer_rec_for_monte_carlo_simulations/godfpyn/) (in reply to ID god1rcq):\nYeah I get there may be better options, but boss wants a good computer we can use when we don’t use the cluster (we get charged a lot for time).\n\n#### Comment ID goe4tmf with +2 score by [(zebediah49, Reddit, 2021-02-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/lprxap/computer_rec_for_monte_carlo_simulations/goe4tmf/) (in reply to ID godfpyn):\nIf you're doing NSF-funded work, it's worth checking out XSEDE.

Additionally, it depends a bit on how many people need to use it, and what else it's for.  Given that, my recommendations are:\n\n- If you're only one person, a standard desktop workstation will do fine.  I probably wouldn't spend more then $2-3k on that, because above that price it tends to be increasingly expensive and decreasingly useful outside of specific circumstances.\n- If you have more to spend, or multiple users, I would strongly suggest a separate \"compute\" machine.  This allows you to get more work done, because you can afford to saturate it.  \"Snappy desktop response for day to day use\" and \"maximum throughput\" are basically opposite goals.  If you're no longer interactively using the machine, it can pound away at a task with saturation.\n- Additionally, you can put a scheduler on it so that you can queue multiple days worth of work at a time, and the computer will work on it as it can.  This performs a lot better (and shares better) than a \"I'll log in and start more stuff as previous things finish\".\n- More cores == more jobs that can run at once.  You can compare the benchmarks with the prices, but in my experience, pricing is currently fairly linear out to the Xeon gold 6248.  You just want to make sure that you have the memory to support whatever you're doing.\n- GPUs are obscenely expensive, but sometimes helpful.  It doesn't sounds like you want to go that route.\n- It's worth checking if you have a local IT department that can help.  For providers like Dell, HP, etc. it's not uncommon to see 20-30% \"we like you\" discounts on big accounts.  Additionally, they may have one or more rooms that you could put rackmount hardware in.  Better networking, redundant power and cooling, etc. are all nice features to have available.\n- On that topic, they may have some decent contacts with vendors.  I don't personally go picking out my memory stick model numbers or whatever.  I send an email over to my rep and say \"I have $5k and I need a machine that has X\".\n- Depending on your needs, it can be worth looking into cloud options.  There are plenty of pitfalls, but it'll let you do things that are otherwise impossible.\n\nIf you have a specific amount of money to work with, I can give somewhat more specific recommendations.. but I can spend anywhere from $1k to $1M without issues.\n\nE: Another: consumer-grade hardware tends to be less happy with \"all day every day\" operation.  The enterprise stuff won't care.\n\n## Comment ID godq6am with +3 score by [(FateEx1994, Reddit, 2021-02-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/lprxap/computer_rec_for_monte_carlo_simulations/godq6am/) (in reply to ID lprxap):\nI think AMD has good multi core performance more recently. \n\nLook up Dave2D on youtube he's got a lot of good videos.\n\n### Comment ID godwnxd with +1 score by [(classroom6, Reddit, 2021-02-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/lprxap/computer_rec_for_monte_carlo_simulations/godwnxd/) (in reply to ID godq6am):\nThanks!

For example, having a server with ipmi is massively helpful if you are running with it in a server room, because the ipmi gives you remote access to bios.  Typically these rigs are 1u or 2u to mount in a 19inch cabinet.\n\nMemory.  You will probably need lots, but you don't say how much you currently   How big are your simulations? I know you said millions, but how big is the state space? If you haven't parallised your code, then you can always run multiple ones on those threads.   So scale up your memory to match. \n\nThe aurora is limited to 128gb of ram in 4 sticks of 32.  For peak performance use all the channels, so 4x8 would be quicker than 1x32, but no room for expansion without ditching that already installed.  Make sure all the ram are the same.\n\nI'm a little surprised you are looking at an aio, which from a quick look, the 7780 appears to be.  Given the choice, I'd go with the aurora, but ymmv.\n\nSo, back to budget, these seem to be not too expensive.  Top end Intel processors alone can cost that much, so it's difficult to advise.\n\nI9-10600kf looks like the fastest beast (4.9) you can add in the aurora.  I think that may have the avx512 if that would help you.\n\nSo long as 128gb isn't limiting you, it sounds OK, but as I said at the outset, you may get a better deal from a smaller independent.\n\nYou could also go team Red, the new ryzen are stunning, to the point they are a tad hard to get hold of as everyone and their dog are grasping for them.\n\n### Comment ID godxi9w with +1 score by [(classroom6, Reddit, 2021-02-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/lprxap/computer_rec_for_monte_carlo_simulations/godxi9w/) (in reply to ID godr1cm):\nThanks! I am US-based. Not sure about how much memory - I definitely have trouble running my stuff on 16 Gigs. I think 64 would be the minimum I would want to buy, but I'm happy to go even higher. I honestly just couldn't find much higher. That also speaks to the price point. We are willing to spend more, I just don't know where to look. I maxed out the dell specs. Do you mean AIO like monitor, desktop, etc?

So All In One.\n\nBut confusing, because water coolers can also be AIO.  On balance, I'd say don't go there.  They are great, but if they fail, ...  no personal experience of it, but its a hassle you can do without.\n\nI'd have gone towards the slightly bigger cases of XPS if going dell.\n\nAnd it looks like 128GB would be a limit for most non specialist pc.  I have 64gb in mine, and it's great, but I know it depends on application: our server machines are equipped with 6x32 (192).\n\n### Comment ID godydk7 with +1 score by [(classroom6, Reddit, 2021-02-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/lprxap/computer_rec_for_monte_carlo_simulations/godydk7/) (in reply to ID godr1cm):\nIt does look like the 7780 is an all in one.

If this is for work in industry (i.e. you are relying on it to make money) then your boss asking someone who by their own admission doesn't know what to look for to choose something is just bizarre.\n\nSo if this really does need to be a machine for serious production work, you need to write up a proper specification based on exactly what requirements your codes have, and you need to take it to whoever does IT procurement in your organisation.\n\nThat's how these things are handled in the research community - use your expertise to describe what requirements the system needs to fulfil, and then use the IT people's expertise to choose something that fits them.\n\n### Comment ID goe5dco with +8 score by [(zebediah49, Reddit, 2021-02-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/lprxap/computer_rec_for_monte_carlo_simulations/goe5dco/) (in reply to ID goe18tz):\nYou're describing how things should work.\n\nSome schools in academia work that way, and it's awesome.

The only time comparable I've seen is when a prof has a grant expiring in the near future and they need to make sure it gets used up, so all of a sudden all their grad students magically acquire new laptops...\n\nI suspect the fact that I work in a decidedly \"big data\" field probably colours my experience as well. I personally \"own\" 200+ TB of data, so things simply have to be done properly - there's no way any off the shelf equipment would be suitable.\n\nAnd it definitely has its downsides - when I wanted a bigger screen for working from home, or a tablet to do marking and notetaking on, it took forever to get it sorted. I'm tech savvy enough to have made those purchases myself, so that was pretty annoying.

You have a goal. Presumably the goal ultimately involves something like \"running simulations as quickly as possible,\" although you haven't been clear about that. But you're crippling your ability to achieve that goal with multiple counterproductive preconditions: the desire to buy a single physical computer, and the related idea that you can't/won't use a lot of cores.\n\nIf your goal is literally something like, \"buy some hardware because we have budget and want a shiny box to point to,\" then knock yourself out and buy the shiniest looking box you can afford.

Don't sweat the details, just get any off-the-shelf PC at the upper end of your price range.  Do not get a fancy graphics card.  Do get a big flash drive.  An AMD Ryzen CPU is probably better than Intel right now.  I can't advise on memory without knowing more about your problem.\n\nFor parallelization, I don't know how your code works, but in general, Monte Carlo methods are trivial to parallelize: just run N copies of the same program and collate the output afterwards.\n\nIf you want to do true parallel simulations, if you want to do CUDA simulations that harness a video card, if you want to do cluster computing or cloud computing -- all of which are good ideas -- you and especially your advisor would have to learn a hell of a lot more about high-performance computing than you do now.

And not in the cliche business way either.\n\nSpeaking of family... lots of young families here at MC. So while it is a startup, there's a healthy balance if you have kids yourself (and they are so accommodating for those with kids!)\n\nOn the tech side, lots of up-to-date tooling working with modern stuff. Feels good and fulfilling.\n\nHonestly hope to see MC through the end, whatever that might look like 🤞",

Monte Carlo focuses on what matters rather than what they think should matter based on some YC blog they read.\n2. Monte Carlo actually has a natural work-life balance because 1) they can avoid burnout this way and 2) most folks have kids at home. This means no Sunday 11pm emails, no calls scheduled after 6pm, etc. \n3. Monte Carlo is obsessed with solving a HUGE problem with a monumental TAM (Snowflake-sized) because anyone that uses a cloud-based data warehouse has a problem trusting their data. \n\nAs a result, Monte Carlo can provide best-in-class benefits (because we've raised a lot of VC from best-in-class investors), hire the best people, and work with the most data-first companies in the ecosystem. Creating and owning a new category that other companies like Datadog (market cap of $35B) and Snowflake (market cap of $80B) will eventually step into is also very satisfying. \n\nFinally, having a woman as CEO that is not some 25 year old wunderkid out of Stanford/MIT/Harvard means diversity, equity, and inclusion starts at the top. We can recruit some of the best talent (1:1 female to male ratio currently) because our culture is actually inclusive and not full of 26 year old white guys from SoMa/The Marina.",

Monte Carlo focuses on what matters rather than what they think should matter based on some YC blog they read.\n2. Monte Carlo actually has a natural work-life balance because 1) they can avoid burnout this way and 2) most folks have kids at home. This means no Sunday 11pm emails, no calls scheduled after 6pm, etc. \n3. Monte Carlo is obsessed with solving a HUGE problem with a monumental TAM (Snowflake-sized) because anyone that uses a cloud-based data warehouse has a problem trusting their data. \n\nAs a result, Monte Carlo can provide best-in-class benefits (because we've raised a lot of VC from best-in-class investors), hire the best people, and work with the most data-first companies in the ecosystem. Creating and owning a new category that other companies like Datadog (market cap of $35B) and Snowflake (market cap of $80B) will eventually step into is also very satisfying. \n\nFinally, having a woman as CEO that is not some 25 year old wunderkid out of Stanford/MIT/Harvard means diversity, equity, and inclusion starts at the top. We can recruit some of the best talent (1:1 female to male ratio currently) because our culture is actually inclusive and not full of 26 year old white guys from SoMa/The Marina.",

      "# [Tsitsipas sweeps aside Ruud to win Monte Carlo Masters for the third time, and then weeps on 2024-04-14](https://apnews.com/article/monte-carlo-masters-tsitsipas-tears-ruud-0d4de57f60a1d4a3914568dca364f7ef)\nMONACO (AP) — Stefanos Tsitsipas swept aside Casper Ruud 6-1, 6-4 on Sunday to win the clay-court Monte Carlo Masters for the third time in four years, and then wept in his chair.\n\nTsitsipas sat holding his head in his hands, briefly crying as he took in his first title of the year and biggest tournament victory for two years.\n\n“I’m very proud of myself today. I had been waiting for a moment like this for a long time,” said the 12th-ranked Tsitsipas, who reached a career-high No. 3 ranking in 2021. “I did not know what was going to happen this week.”\n\nThe big-serving Greek also won the title in 2021 and 2022 and this latest trophy at the Monte Carlo Country Club took him to 11 career titles overall.\n\n“It has been very difficult, so to be back on the podium, winning tournaments, just feels amazing,” Tsitsipas said. “The third time is even more special than the first or second time. This is an unbelievable win for me. Capturing that win today was nerve-wracking, I really wanted this trinity.”\n\nIt was his first trophy since August last year, when he won a modest ATP 250-level tournament on outdoor hard courts at Los Cabos in Mexico.\n\nThis was much more prestigious and he shared a warm hug at the net with Ruud, who is chasing his first title of the year and remains stuck on 10 overall.\n\nThe match featured former French Open runner-ups and offered an early indication of form heading into the clay-court major at next month’s Roland Garros.\n\nTsitsipas was an outsider coming into this tournament, where he was seeded 12th.\n\nBut he got the better of Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner in the semifinals, handing him only his second defeat of the season to set up a perhaps unexpected final against Ruud, who beat top-ranked Novak Djokovic in Saturday’s other semi.\n\nTsitsipas took an early control.\n\nHe broke Ruud’s serve and held for 3-1, then secured another break of serve when eighth-seeded Ruud flapped a loose forehand into the net from the back of the court. A nervous-looking Ruud double-faulted on set point.\n\nRuud improved in the second set and pressured Tsitsipas, who saved three break points and took 13 minutes to hold serve in a tough seventh game.\n\nThat seemed to be Ruud’s last chance while also summing up his erratic match, where he made too many unforced errors and failed to convert any of his eight break-point chances.\n\nTsitsipas hit an ace to win his next service game, leaving Ruud needing to hold serve to stay in the match.\n\nAn unforced error at 30-30 saw Ruud patting a straightforward-looking backhand long to offer Tsitsipas a first match point.\n\nHe seized the moment.\n\nTsitsipas dominated a brief rally and clinched victory with a forehand winner, then slid on his back with his arms outstretched and put his hands on his face.\n\n“I managed the point relatively well and finished it with the winner,” Tsitsipas said. “I showed some ruthless tennis. From the beginning to the end, my play was cohesive.”\n\nTsitsipas will improve to No. 7 when the ATP rankings are released on Monday.\n\n___",

      "# [Accessing Math Solutions via Monte Carlo Self-Refine with LLaMa-3 8B](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40659322)\nI am confused about how the MCTSr algorithm actually is. It is not clear how it is better than simply mutating potential answers (by LLM) and sorting by LLM self-eval.\n\nI have a hard time understanding how many LLM evals MCTSr actually does. How the rollout limit is implemented is not described at all. It doesn't seem like it can mean the same thing as for normal MCTS because there is not any definitive \"end\" to the tree search. Additionally, MCTS is normally limited by the nodes expanded.\n\nAside from theoretical concerns, it is not clear why they have not include an > 8 rollout version in the tables or used an LLM stronger than Llama 3 8B. If the concept scales well it should be able to beat GPT-4 and friends by a rather large margin.\n\nObviously marrying search with LLMs is a ripe area for research, but I find it hard to actually take anything away from this paper.\n\nEDIT:\n\nAdded a missing greater than sign\n\nTwo differences in MCTS (or their MCTSr) from what you describe: First is that using just the self-eval as an authoritative score rather than a probability distribution increases the likelihood that a low-quality evaluation (a.k.a. an inaccurate evaluation) will throw off the entire search process. Second is that by using MCTS, a low-quality action (MCTSr -> solution) that doesn't turn out to be low-quality until several refinement rounds doesn't throw off the entire search, either, since the tree search can go back to the root and experiment with a different earlier branch.\n\nA single rollout is the full process described in chapter 3. \"The algorithm iterates through these stages until a termination condition T is met, including rollout constraints or maximum exploration depth\"\n\nI can't say as to why they didn't try using a bigger model than Llama 3 8B, or more rollouts.\n\n[edit] counter-edit\n\n> They did include an 8-rollout version in the tables? I can't say as to why they didn't try using a bigger model than Llama 3 8B.\n\nThat was a typo. I meant a > 8 rollout version. It doesn't seem like they have hit massively diminishing returns yet.\n\n> A single rollout is the full process described in chapter 3. \"The algorithm iterates through these stages until a termination condition T is met, including rollout constraints or maximum exploration depth\"\n\nA rollout is not the entire process. The summary of normal MCTS correctly identifies rollouts as \"random simulations by selecting moves arbitrarily until a game’s conclusion is reached, thereby evaluating the node’s potential\". Nothing actually like rollouts is ever described.\n\nTypically MCTS is limited by nodes expanded which is likely what they mean, but because they correctly described rollouts, it seems like I am missing something. Also they mention AlphaGo which replaces rollouts with a neural eval which maybe is relevant.\n\nIf rollouts means nodes expanded, 4 and 8 are both just really low numbers.",

      "# [Monte-Carlo graph search from first principles](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39662698)\nThis looks too low level.\n\nWhat might be a step forward is a joint learning of the state representation with the search algorithm. Search algorithm explores the NN representation of the state for which you can get the cost.\n\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/genie-2024/\n\nGenie from DeepMind is a good demonstration where discrete state is being modeled. NN learns a very complex representation with collision detection and actions. Instead of decoding that state into pixels, search could probably be done directly on that state.\n\nOf course, this architecture could be very different.\n\nAn over-simplified approach that would be interesting to explore:\n\n1. Given a collection of logical arguments, figure out how to assign a hash to each argument.\n\n2. Build a Merkle tree representing the argument's hashes, nesting according to first principles.\n\n3. If an argument is challenged successfully, the argument's hash changes, rendering descendent argument hashes invalid.\n\nIt's technically a different algorithm just under the same \"monte carlo\" name.\n\nHowever something interesting of note is that since most applications of monte carlo methods rely on PRNGs instead of true RNGs, they are technically deterministic (as given the same PRNG seed you should always get the same result for a given input).\n\nSo what this algorithm is doing instead of using a normal PRNG and a separate heuristic, is to instead query the neural network. This works because the neural net is an heuristic over a massive search space which ends up acting like a very poor PRNG that is heavily biased towards specific results based on the training of the neutal net, which in turn ends up looking like a PRNG with a set of heuristics applied.\n\nThe important thing to note is that this is a specialisation of MCTS and as such shouldn't technically work for all use cases.\n\nWhen we make game-playing AI (which is all AI, depending on your analogy comfort), one of the most promising techniques is Tree Search, which ranks moves based on the descendant moves. In games where you could reach the same state in many ways, much memory might be wasted to re-record the same state node on different branches.\n\nThis article is a nice exploration of an approach called Graph Search, which essentially trades compute for memory by doing extra compute work (hashing the game states) to check to see if the nodes are already visited. That saves us from re-recording nodes we already saw, and consequently converts trees (free of cycles) into directed acyclic graphs.\n\nThis forces some tinkering with the tree search to get correct results, specifically it demands a focus more on edges (actions or moves) as the unit of optimization, rather than on vertices (states). It’s a well written technical essay in literate programming written by someone who understands their subject.\n\nI would argue that this saves both compute and memory for any significant search. In a traditional tree-search without treating states as identical and revistable still requires you to store every node that you visit in memory to track the N, Q, and child relations.\n\nApplying the algorithm adds a hash associated with each node, and a counter on each edge. On the other side you're de-duplicating identical states in your search space, saving the memory of duplicate nodes but more importantly saving compute by not requiring independent searches of the same state space. Whether this trade off actually saves memory will be determined based on how likely duplicate states are in your search space.\n\nOtherwise your summary is absolutely spot on.",
      "# [3D Gaussian Splatting as Markov Chain Monte Carlo](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40719975)\nIt's true, Gaussian Splatting is just an alternative to meshing a pointcloud for companies which currently rely on photogrammetry or lidar (Lidar works well as a basis for splatting when there's reference images taken as part of the scan). But I think that misses all the new opportunities that exist with Gaussian Splatting, which really just don't with existing techniques.\n\nGaussian Splats are able to handle more heterogeneous information sources, allowing more sources to help splat an environment. Devices like drones, surveillance cameras, or autonomous systems can be used to create or incrementally update a Gaussian Splat; and there's interesting work to allow them to locate themselves within the splat, not just to show themselves but also to place vision ML outputs into it (such as object detection or segmentation results).\n\nUp till now nearly all digital representations of physical environments are either based off the original designs (by things like CAD or BIM files), or are an approximation of the environment (from photogrammetry or Lidar scans). CAD and BIM files suffer from drift, the real environment almost never perfectly matches the design files, small (and large) changes are made; and many times those files aren't even available if the structure isn't new. Photogrammetry and Lidar scans struggle because their output is a pointcloud, and it's very difficult to accurately mesh a pointcloud (Matterport only partially solved this problem and sold for $1.6B). Gaussian Splats overcome these issues; they're comparatively easy to generate for any environment, and allow for very accurate and easy viewing from any angle.\n\nI think the Digital Twin space will be turned upside down, and they could potentially even cause huge changes in autonomous and semi-autonomous factories, warehouses, and depots. A single Gaussian Splat could be the source of truth that many autonomous vehicles update through their separate SLAM systems. Operators then would have access to this splat (and it's history) as a source of truth for the environment. Then, using techniques like iComMa[1], it may be possible to directly align XR devices into the Gaussian Splat; allowing operators direct access to location-based information generated by the environment.\n\nThat's a lot of words to say: Gaussian Splatting is a very neat new technology that could really underpin many future technologies, I'm really excited about it\n\n[1]: https://yuansun-xjtu.github.io/iComMa.io/\n\nIt's important to disentangle this specific approach of generating a gaussian splatting model from 2d images, with gaussian splats as a general rendering technique.\n\nThere is nothing that prevents gaussian splatting from being used dynamically. There are a variety of approaches to extend gaussian splats into the time dimension to capture and represent a 3d scene over time. The challenges here about how to capture sufficient scene data (or use ai to fill in insufficient data) and how to compress it. There are also techniques that enable dynamic simulations, or real time animation of collections of splats.\n\nAlso, adding un-baked lighting to gaussian splats is not particularly hard, you can already throw slats into several game engines / 3d renderers and add new lights to them. The hard part of relighting is taking an existing capture of a scene with baked-in lighting and deriving the resulting material properties and lighting sources. This isn't directly related to gaussian splats themselves though, you would have a similar problem recovering the base materials and lights from a 3d mesh with baked-in lighting textures. This really falls under a separate category of techniques called \"inverse rendering\". If anything, gaussian splats give us a new tool to help with these sorts of problems.\n\nHonestly the biggest remaining roadblocks to more elaborate and widespread uses of gaussians as a rendering method are probably storage and performance related. And I'm optimistic these will be convincingly solved, triangle rasterization has had many orders of magnitude more research, optimization, and custom hardware built around it.\n\nNo the main difference is looking at the problem from a new perspective, relating it to a large body of existing work in statistics (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_Langevin_d...). Then they are able to use this new perspective to add several improvements that lead to significant quality improvements, clearly establishing the validity and utility of the new theoretical underpinnings. It's likely this will be massively influential in the direction of future research in the space.\n\nThe actual changes this led to are:\n\n1) As you mentioned, they added noise. But notably, they state it was \"designed carefully\" to conform to the requirements of SGLD and they detail how they designed the noise.\n\n2) They simplified the original operations of \"move, split, clone, prune, and add\" and their related heuristics, into a single operation type. They do so guided by existing knowledge about MCMC frameworks, leading to a simpler model with stronger theoretical underpinnings (huge win!).\n\n3) Adjustments to how gaussians are added and pruned to better fit with the new model. This seems more like housekeeping rather than something novel in and of itself.",

The Serbian, winner in 2013 and 2015, will meet the victor between France’s Arthur Fils and Italy’s Lorenzo Musetti who play their second round match later on Tuesday. Musetti defeated Djokovic at the third-round stage last year.\n\nHubert Hurkacz is into the second round with a 6-4, 3-6, 7-6(2) win, but was made to battle by Britain’s Jack Draper after the Polish 10th seed looked like dominating early on. Hurkacz raced into a 3-0 lead in the first set but Draper rallied to level at 4-4, before the Pole broke serve to take the opener. Draper then broke to love twice to win the second set and force the decider.\n\nWith Hurkacz serving at 5-4 to win the match, Draper broke serve but it was a relieved Hurkacz who emerged victorious in the tie-break. Hurkacz, who also beat Draper at last year’s tournament, will face Roberto Bautista Agut of Spain in the second round.\n\nAlex de Minaur had little trouble seeing off the challenge of the former champion Stan Wawrinka, winning 6-3, 6-0 to progress to the second round. Wawrinka won the title in 2014, but a decade later the Swiss 39-year-old was no match for the Australian 11th seed, who needed only 24 minutes to complete a bagel in the second set, and will face Tallon Griekspoor.\n\nSebastian Korda also eased into the second round with a 6-1, 6-2 win over Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, finalist in 2022, but will face a much stiffer test when he takes on the world No 2 Jannik Sinner in the next round. “Obviously, he’s probably the best tennis player in the world right now,” Korda said in advance of meeting the Australian Open champion. “He’s had an unbelievable season and it’s going to be our first meeting on the clay. I’m just going to try to go out there, try my best, and see what happens.”\n\nCarlos Alcaraz, the third seed, has withdrawn from the tournament with an arm injury, and his second round place was taken by the lucky loser Lorenzo Sonego, who will play Felix Auger-Aliassime. Alcaraz may also have an eye on his preparation for the French Open, which begins on 20 May.\n\n“I have been working in Monte Carlo and trying to recover until the last minute from an injured pronator teres in my right arm, but it was not possible and I cannot play,” Alcaraz posted on social media. “I was really looking forward to playing.

It estimates how much a portfolio might lose, given normal market conditions, over a set time period.\n\nThere are three ways to compute VaR: the parametric method, the historical method, and the Monte Carlo method.\n\nIn contrast to the parametric and historical methods which are backward looking, Monte Carlo is forward looking.\n\nIn todayâs newsletter, youâll be able to simulate the equity curve of a portfolio of ETFs and compute the VaR using the Monte Carlo Method.\n\nIf youâre ready, letâs go!\n\nQuickly compute Value at Risk with Monte Carlo\n\nThe Monte Carlo method for computing VaR involves generating a large number (sometimes millions) of hypothetical simulations of the evolution of a portfolio.\n\nThe scenarios correspond to a potential future value of a portfolio considering asset prices, weights, and covariances.\n\nBy simulating these scenarios, we can estimate the distribution of the portfolioâs future value.\n\nFrom there, we can figure out VaR by identifying the worst losses at a specific confidence level, usually the 95th percentile.\n\nThe VaR represents the maximum amount of money we can expect to lose over a set time horizon.\n\nLuckily for us, Python makes it easy to do.\n\nImports and set up\n\nWe only need three libraries for todayâs issue. NumPy for the linear algebra, pandas for building DataFrames, and OpenBB for data. Weâll start by downloading data for a mock portfolio of 25 sector ETFs.\n\nimport numpy as np import pandas as pd from openbb import obb sectors = [ \"XLE\", \"XLF\", \"XLU\", \"XLI\", \"GDX\", \"XLK\", \"XLV\", \"XLY\", \"XLP\", \"XLB\", \"XOP\", \"IYR\", \"XHB\", \"ITB\", \"VNQ\", \"GDXJ\", \"IYE\", \"OIH\", \"XME\", \"XRT\", \"SMH\", \"IBB\", \"KBE\", \"KRE\", \"XTL\", ] data = obb.equity.price.historical( sectors, start_date=\"2022-01-01\", provider=\"yfinance\" ).to_df()\n\nNext, weâll compute the historic mean returns, weights, and covariance matrix.\n\ndata[\"returns\"] = data.groupby(\"symbol\").close.pct_change() portfolio_stats = data.groupby(\"symbol\").agg( daily_returns=(\"returns\", \"mean\"), ) portfolio_stats[\"weights\"] = 1 / len(sectors) covariance_matrix = ( data .pivot( columns=\"symbol\", values=\"returns\" ) .dropna() .cov() )\n\nIn todayâs example, we use a simple average of past returns to represent future expected returns. We also use a static, equal weighted portfolio. From our returns, we can use pandas to compute the covariance matrix between the sector historic returns. Weâll use the covariance matrix in the Monte Carlo to simulate the covariance between assets in the future price paths.\n\nSet up the Monte Carlo simulation\n\nNow that we have our historical returns and covariance matrix, we can generate the simulated price paths.\n\nsimulations = 1_000days = len(data.index.unique()) initial_capital = 100_000 portfolio = np.zeros((days, simulations)) historical_returns = np.full( shape=(days, len(sectors)), fill_value=portfolio_stats.daily_returns )\n\nWe start by defining the number of simulations, the number of days, and the initial portfolio capital. We set up arrays to store the portfolio values and historical returns. Next, we run the simulation.\n\nL = np.linalg.cholesky(covariance_matrix) for i inrange(0, simulations): Z = np.random.normal(size=(days, len(sectors))) daily_returns = historical_returns + np.dot(L, Z.T).T portfolio[:, i] = ( np.cumprod(np.dot(daily_returns, portfolio_stats.weights) + 1) * initial_capital ) simulated_portfolio = pd.DataFrame(portfolio)\n\nFirst, we calculate the Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix. Sounds complicated but all it does is generate correlated random variables. In the loop, we generate a normally distributed random variable and adjust it by the Cholesky factor to simulate daily returns.\n\nThese returns are then used to calculate our cumulative portfolio returns over the time period for each simulation. Finally, we use the NumPy array output to construct a pandas DataFrame.\n\nAnalyze the results\n\nNow that we have our simulate results, we can compute VaR and conditional VaR.\n\nalpha = 5 defmontecarlo_var(alpha): sim_val = simulated_portfolio.iloc[-1, :] return np.percentile(sim_val, alpha) defconditional_var(alpha): sim_val = simulated_portfolio.iloc[-1, :] return sim_val[sim_val <= montecarlo_var(alpha)].mean() mc_var = montecarlo_var(alpha) cond_var = conditional_var(alpha) ax = simulated_portfolio.plot(lw=0.25, legend=False) ax.axhline(mc_var, lw=0.5, c=\"r\") ax.axhline(cond_var, lw=0.5, c=\"g\")\n\nVaR is the value at the lower 5th percentile of the final portfolio values. It represents the dollar amount the portfolio will lose with 95% confidence.\n\nThe Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is also known as Expected Shortfall. CVaR is computed as the mean of the simulated values at the last time step that are less than or equal to VaR. Since CVaR captures the worst case losses beyond that of the point estimate provided by VaR, itâs often seen as a superior to VaR.\n\nThe plot visualizes all price paths, VaR, and CVaR. We can see that CVaR (the green line) is less than VaR which demonstrates the more conservative calculation.\n\nNext steps\n\nThis simulation assumes static expected returns, no drift, no volatility, and a static covariance matrix. As a next step, use a look back window for the covariance matrix. You can also try introducing drift and volatility into the price paths.",
      "# [Why a dry Monte is bad news for Mikkelsen – DirtFish by James Bowen on 2024-01-25](https://dirtfish.com/rally/wrc/why-a-dry-monte-is-bad-news-for-mikkelsen/)\nFor Andreas Mikkelsen, the wait is finally over.\n\nOn Wednesday’s shakedown for the Monte Carlo Rally, the Norwegian got his first taste of Rally1 machinery in anger, and his first run in a top-flight World Rally Championship car on an official event since 2019.\n\nAfter describing that experience as “f****** fast” at the end of his first blast through the shakedown stage, the double WRC2 champion elaborated on how different his Hyundai i20 N feels to anything he has driven before.\n\n“These cars are so fast, I remember driving the 2018-19 car but this is one step more,” he told DirtFish. “It’s just very different to what I’m used to [in] the last five years. I feel I’m braking late but then I have to go on the throttle again and then brake a second time because the limits are in a different place to what I’m used to.\n\n“So this I guess will be my challenge this weekend, to try to understand the limits quickly because it’s limited testing these days. But it’s fun, good fun to drive, really quick.”\n\nWith the reece complete, and this week’s weather forecast in, the smart money appears to be on this year’s Monte being a dry one, save for a few patches of black ice and frost on the early morning stages.\n\nHaving completed his pre-event test in similar conditions, and with so much still to learn about his new car, conventional wisdom would suggest that a dry rally would suit the three-time WRC winner down to the ground.\n\nBut Mikkelsen doesn’t want straightforward conditions, he wants chaos. Why?\n\nThe Hyundai driver said: “I was hoping for terrible conditions, to be honest. Tricky with ice and slush. Then you don’t need to know your car so well because it’s more about understanding how the tires work in these conditions, and there we have a lot of experience.”\n\nAnd there lies Mikkelsen’s secret weapon: he developed the current generation of WRC tires for Pirelli.\n\nHaving lost his Hyundai seat after the 2019 season, the Norwegian kept himself sharp by hopping in the tire constructor’s Citroën C3 WRC test car during the 2020 campaign, ahead of Pirelli’s return to the series the following year.\n\nIn each Monte since, there hasn’t been the need to use winter tires, meaning Mikkelsen still has vastly more experience on the Sottozero STZ-B, which has optional low-profile studs and is only made available in the WRC for the season opener.\n\nWith Pirelli making its exit from the WRC after this season, this year’s event marks the only chance Mikkelsen has to press home that advantage. And heading into the rally’s opening stages on Thursday night, that chance is looking quite slim.\n\nDespite his Monte wishes appearing not to have been granted, Mikkelsen still has ambitions to challenge his rivals from Toyota and M-Sport on his Rally1 debut.\n\n“The feeling is really good [in the car],” Mikkelsen said. “On the test, you know your reference points for braking, but now it’s all about pushing and getting it right on the first pass. This will take a little bit of time but I know in myself, I will sleep a bit on it tonight, wake up [on Thursday] and suddenly, maybe it’s already there.\n\nHe added: “I would be happy with a top five. To fight with Sébastien [Ogier], Elfyn [Evans], Ott [Tänak] and Thierry [Neuville], without them having any issues, that’s unrealistic. Also, [Takamoto] Katsuta, let’s see where we are compared to him and the Fords but I think this is the area I should look at.",
