      "# [Singularity 6 is Going Remote Choice](https://www.singularity6.com/news/s6-remote-choice)\nSINGULARITY 6 was just a team of twenty individuals when we moved into our new office in West Los Angeles. It was 2020, and only two weeks later, the pandemic hit in full swing. We made the call to work remotely, and shared our experience in a previous blog post.\n\nSince then, we’ve announced our first game, successfully ran a number of testing phases, and grew to a company of over 135 people—all while supporting a remote work policy.\n\nBut one big question remained: What was our plan for returning to the office?\n\nWe’re happy to announce that S6 is going Remote Choice!\n\nWhat Remote Choice Means\n\nRemote Choice means we’re championing for our team to decide what’s best for them. They can choose to work remotely, return to our office, or somewhere in-between with a hybrid setup. Save for certain essential roles that require being onsite, this option will be available to our employees indefinitely. At the end of the day, we’re advocating for different needs, preferences, and circumstances of our Sixers, which is why we emphasize the word “choice.”\n\nAlong with the option to work at our LA-based office (and another we’re planning on opening in Orange County, CA), Sixers can choose to work remotely so long as they’re based in the following approved locations:\n\nUnited States\n\nCalifornia, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Michigan, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington\n\nCanada\n\nQuebec\n\nOf course, even with our employees spread across the continent, we’re still making an effort to bring Sixers together. We still want those casual chats and moments of joy that great ideas can come from, so office onsites, local team meet-ups, and digital events are in the works as we move forward.\n\nAnd Yes, We’re Still Hiring\n\nHere at S6, we believe online games can foster meaningful and memorable experiences. Palia will be our first attempt at realizing that vision, and development for it is heavily underway.\n\nTake a look at our careers page for our current job openings, or keep an eye out for future postings as we prepare for launch. We have over 30 positions available across a number of disciplines such as Art, Design, Engineering, and Talent Acquisition.",
      "# [Adventures in LA: S6 2022 Studio Summit](https://www.singularity6.com/news/s6-2022-summit)\nNew friends, community, crafting, mini-games, adventure… in Palia? Absolutely. But also in-person with the Singularity 6 team coming together at the 2022 studio summit!\n\nThe last week of September saw Sixers from across North America gather in sunny Los Angeles for a wholesome two-day all-hands conference that included nostalgic button-mashing at the arcade, creativity-fueled team bonding sessions, and studio leadership presentations served with a healthy side of memes (stonks, anyone?).\n\nThe summit was Singularity 6’s first company-wide meeting in 2022, and it couldn’t have come soon enough. The studio has more than doubled in size (!!!) since 2021, and the event was the first opportunity for nearly 150 Sixers to take a break from a virtual environment, meet IRL, cut loose, and bond over some friendly(ish) competitive blue shell-tossing kart racing action.\n\n“As our team continues to grow and scale, it was a big priority for us to bring the studio together in 2022,” said Singularity 6 CEO & Co-Founder Anthony Leung. “I was blown away by the energy that our team brought to the summit. It made me so happy to see new and veteran Sixers collaborating and showcasing the best of our company culture.”\n\nOff-key karaoke and welcoming dinner parties are wonderful. But the real (Chapaa?) meat and potatoes of the summit was the overwhelming sense of unity and camaraderie on display from Sixers participating in activities across the board. Group session outcomes in design, art, production, tech, and more proved that Sixers are truly player obsessed.\n\nSessions included no shortage of marshmallow-wielding Sixers working together to construct the tallest – if not the most structurally sound – spaghetti towers. Brainstorming Sixers ‘illuminated’ one corner of the conference room with a rainbow array of Post-It notes. And the entire studio crowdsourced polygonal works of art that represent our company values. Some pieces were more, uh, “abstract” than others. But all in all, these sessions showcased a shared ambition of creating experiences that enhances players' lives and celebrates the intricacies of the human condition through work, play, and community.\n\nAnd with diversity, equity, and inclusion serving as the backbone of the studio — our talented Sixer speakers were empowered to discuss a range of topics that detailed the holistic vision for Singularity 6 and an inclusive studio experience.\n\nWe want to give a HUGE shoutout to S6’s People Ops & Talent Acquisition team who planned the summit’s awesome activities, and we cannot wait to apply key learnings from the event as Singularity 6 continues to grow and build our world class team. Between Sixers hitting the one-two step for S-tier scores in dance simulators, and studio co-founders Aidan Karabaich and Anthony Leung sharing plans for the studio’s future, a refreshed Singularity 6 is poised to deliver games that forge alternate worlds that deepen players’ lives.",
      "# [Palia Community Demonstrates Player Excitement and Appeal of New IP](https://www.singularity6.com/news/palia-community-excitement)\nWe're pleased to share that Palia is showing significant momentum with strong community engagement numbers, including more than 600,000 signups, that demonstrate the growing appetite for an elevated cozy sim experience among a mainstream audience.\n\nWhen revealed in June 2021, Palia was instantly embraced by both core and casual gaming audiences. Within 3 months of the title reveal, more than 600,000 players filled out a survey to playtest the game, outpacing the number of followers of Steam’s most Wishlisted games. An impressive feat for a product still in development (if we don't say so ourselves!), demonstrating a strong desire from players for the type of meaningful online game experience that we're creating.\n\nWe're intentionally building Palia alongside players, as part of the studio’s approach to game development, so that S6 can respond to the community and make improvements at every stage, and over time. Even in the earliest phases of development, the studio cultivated a highly-engaged community that has grown to more than 100,000 Discord members. Additionally, we welcomed nearly 20,000 players across several Alpha tests in 2022 and 2023. In a single Alpha window, players logged more than 167,000 hours in a month, with top players averaging about 200 hours (!!!) of playtime.\n\nOur team is developing Palia to feel welcoming, playful and friendly, which resonated strongly with early adopters looking for a sense of community, acceptance and belonging. By having strong foundations in place for its community from the outset, Singularity 6 has built trust and respect with these early adopters, who continue to help shape the game and have become evangelists for its growing community.\n\nWe look forward to sharing more information about Palia and our amazing community in the future!",
      "# [The Software Architecture of Palia](https://www.singularity6.com/news/software-architecture-of-palia)\nSingularity6’s debut game, Palia, is a free-to-play cozy online multiplayer community simulator. A place where players can play alone or with their friends to experience a beautiful and welcoming world which can be explored and personalized.\n\nSocial interaction and a persistent shared world are key features of the game. But these elements are also some of the most challenging to implement, scale, distribute geographically, and operate at minimal operational cost and negative player impact.\n\nPlayers experience the art and soul that our development team has poured into the game, but the infrastructure that makes it all possible behind the scenes is hidden from view. We are proud of what our team has accomplished with Palia, and we want to spotlight the studio’s hard work, including what players don’t experience directly. We also want to share some important lessons learned during our journey; we hope that sharing the lessons learned while developing Palia can be useful to others facing similar challenges.\n\nNow follow us behind the scenes of our Palia development journey!\n\nGame Engine\n\nBuilding an online multiplayer title from scratch benefits from a robust and proven game engine. We made the choice to build Palia using Unreal Engine. Unreal gives us powerful tools to build with out of the box, such as a strong networking and replication library to build social features, a graphics pipeline to build a beautiful world, a powerful physics engine that can simulate complex environments, and so much more. We use Unreal Engine for our game servers as well as our client, which gives players a real-time interactive environment.\n\nEach instance of the game server currently hosts up to 25 players, and we split up each server by what we call a map. These can be permanent fixtures, including our central hub Kilima Village, or even temporary available experiences, such as our Maji Market, which was only available for one month during our Luna New Year in-game event. When players travel between maps in Palia, the game client disconnects from one server and connects to a new one. We will share more details on how this works in our matchmaking service deep dive section.\n\nThis synergistic model is crucial for our team: we can develop most of the logic for Palia inside the engine and deploy to both clients and servers. This allows anyone on the team to test both the game and the game server in editor mode, which has been critical for our development velocity.\n\nSpotlight: memory leakage\n\nUnreal Engine servers are commonly used in “session-based games,” such as Fortnite: games that start and end within a certain amount of time. Memory leakage is not a big concern for session-based games because a new server is spun up for a new match and destroyed when the match ends. Any leaked memory will be cleaned before the next batch of players begin playing.\n\nPalia is a persistent shared-world game and the lifespan of our game servers is variable depending on how players move through the game world. A single game server may remain online and serve players for an entire patch cycle which could be weeks. Memory leakage which is cleaned up regularly for a session-based game can grow and compound, and small leaks might end up consuming two or even four times the amount of Random Access Memory (RAM) proportionally affecting our operational costs.\n\nTo combat this issue, we invested in solutions to help us identify memory leaks, and we spent useful time designing nudges for players to travel between maps as to increase the likelihood that a server would empty out and be shut down.\n\nUnexpectedly and fortunately, increasing geographical distribution helped with this problem: hosting servers near players not only helps with latency (because it reduces the distance that signals need to travel); but also with rotating empty servers because players tend to play at the same times, making it rare that somebody in that region is playing in the middle of the night and increasing the probability of servers to become empty, shut down, and cleaned.\n\nThis screenshot from one of our monitoring dashboards shows the memory usage of a portion of our game servers over a24h period in Feb 2024. The trend of linear memory increase is clearly visible.\n\nServices\n\nThe game client and servers talk to our services for specific actions, such as logging players into the game, loading characters, saving progress, sending chat messages to other players, making purchased outfits are stored in the player’s closet and many more.\n\nWe loosely follow a “microservice” posture, in which we prefer to host many different services specialized on one player feature.\n\nWe use HTTP as the North/South protocol (in and out of the datacenter) while we use gRPC for East/West communication (for services talking to each other inside the datacenter).\n\nWe use Rust exclusively as the programming language for our services and we try to include both integration and load testing as part of the definition of “done” for key services, including matchmaking, player presence and player state persistence which represent the largest percentage of our request load.\n\nOur unit and integration tests are also written in Rust, but we use Locust to support and execute our load tests. Locust load tests are written in Python which is simpler to program. The ability to quickly write and modify load tests was beneficial to us and sped up adoption.\n\nSpotlight: Rust for Microservices\n\nRust is a beloved programming language by many systems programmers because it provides state-of-the-art protection against common software vulnerabilities (buffer overflows and race conditions, for example) without introducing any performance penalties.\n\nRust is also a modern programming language. It is surrounded by a diverse and vibrant community of contributors and a wide range of libraries and tools. Documentation is excellent (especially onboarding tutorials) and the compiler is surely one of the most helpful and user-friendly.\n\nOf course, no programming language is perfect. Rust's posture is heavily focused on correctness, which is generally beneficial, but comes with a significant upfront cost which is visible in our development velocity. Rust makes it very hard to “cut corners” and punt hardening for later. It is a very good quality when something that was supposed to be just a prototype becomes load bearing in production by sheer pressure of business needs, but it makes it hard to move quickly and with agility around shifting requirements (which is a constant in startups and game development).\n\nThe other issue was hiring and onboarding. Rust’s relative youth as a programming language makes it somewhat difficult to hire people that have production experience with the language. Although the language is very popular, few people have used Rust in a professional team setting. Most people who have Rust experience have only used it for personal projects. With this in mind, onboarding took much longer than we expected. We factored 90 days to get engineers up to speed, but it turned out to take at least 6 months for most of the team to get comfortable and confident with the language.\n\nWe are very happy with the performance, latency, scalability, robustness and security of our Rust services. But there are moments when we wonder how much opportunity cost was spent in forcing up-front solidity of every piece of this layer.\n\nWe consider it an advantage for the studio to have managed to amortize those onboarding costs and the maintenance costs of our services is indeed very low, but those thinking of following our footsteps down the Rust path, should be willing to allocate a significant effort to education and onboarding. These costs will likely reduce over time as Rust becomes more popular in production settings, but it’s unclear what that rate will be.\n\nSeveral of our services are interesting and sophisticated enough to merit more attention: player state management and matchmaking.\n\nPlayer State Management\n\nWe consider player state all the information that a game server needs to recreate the most recent game world experienced by the player. The architecture of our game is server-authoritative which means that game servers decide the state of the world and act as referees when game clients report inconsistent data (for example, because of time delay in transmission). We took this route because Palia is a social game so a player cheating or modifying their state could have a negative impact on the experience of other players. The risk of cheating is reduced when it's our system that ultimately controls player state.\n\nThe simplest way to persist state is to wait until a player exits a game server and have the server send this information to the database. Unfortunately, this makes state changes in that server vulnerable to the server itself crashing and losing that data (which is only kept in volatile memory for performance reasons). Instead, several times a second we check for player state changes, and if there are any, that data is immediately queued and sent to the database to be persisted.\n\nSpotlight: data first vs. schema first\n\nA source of contention around player state is the modeling lifecycle: who and what decides what is valid to be stored into such a state? Traditional data-modeling techniques suggest a “schema first” approach: the structure of the data (the schema) is created ahead of time and then only data that conforms to that structure can be saved into the database.\n\nThis has the advantage that the database validates the shape of the data. The disadvantage is that one has to know ahead of time the structure of the data needed… which can be challenging to coordinate across different teams.\n\nTo increase the ease with which game engineers and technical designers could work, we decided on a different model in which the structure of the data would be decided in C++ structs directly within Unreal and then marshaled and persisted in the database as a binary blob (using the Flexbuffer format). The schema is the struct declaration itself and we use Unreal’s runtime type reflection system to export the schema to our database.\n\nThe advantage of this architectural choice is that it enabled game engineers to develop features that required state persistence without the need for constant coordination. The downside is that the data is opaque to the database, which is more expensive to keep uniform and consolidated. This has required us to invest in additional tooling around the player state management system to validate, backup, modify and correct player state when it diverges from the expected structure.\n\nDespite the additional layer of development investment needed to provide hardening on top of what the database normally provides, we believe this architecture has significantly cut down the time required to deliver new features with data persistence, such as our most recent Luna New Year event.\n\nMatchmaking\n\nIn many competitive-style online games, matchmaking is the process of selecting people for a match. For Palia, matchmaking means matching the player with the game server that we believe will give players the best gameplay experience.\n\nThere are several dimensions that we take into consideration during matching:\n\nLocation - how far away the game server is from where the player is currently playing (because closer server means lower latency and lower latency means a more fluid and immersive experience)\n\nFriends - how many of the player’s friends are currently playing on that server (because the more people they know the more meaningful their interaction will be)\n\nPopulation - how many people are playing on that server (because the more people are playing the more alive the world feels)\n\nThe matchmaking system is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing us to add more signals to the matching algorithm over time if we desire.\n\nAnother crucial feature of the matchmaking system is the ability to distinguish “join” requests and “travel” requests. A join request happens when a player starts the game and wants to join. A travel request is a match required by a player leaving one map of the game and traveling to another.\n\nThe ability to distinguish the two allows us to offer priority to “travel” requests when the system is under load and there is high contention. This is because it’s far less disruptive for players to wait a few minutes to join and then wait only a few seconds to travel between maps, than one in which the delays are spread uniformly across all matching requests.\n\nThis screenshot shows a piece of the dashboard we use to monitor queue sizes and the distribution of times it takes for a matchmaking request (join or travel) to be satisfied.\n\nSpotlight: game-aware internal queueing and autoscaling\n\nEvery empty server running in the cloud without a player on it is a waste of money. On the other hand, there might be players who want to play and all of the game servers have their allocated slots filled so they would benefit from an empty server to land in.\n\nMany online games design “login queues” or similar ways to restrict the inbound flow of players and scale up or down the number of servers to meet the demand. Originally, this was our intent as well, but we realized we would benefit from a more sophisticated matchmaking design that could distinguish between joining and traveling. We also realized that the matchmaker had all the information it needed to control the size of the game server fleet.\n\nThis is how we came up with the Admiral: a component of the matchmaking system that oversees the fleet of game servers. The Admiral understands when the current fleet of game servers is insufficient to satisfy the number of players requesting a match and is able to ask the underlying cloud system (specifically Agones) to request the creation of more game server instances. Agones, on the other hand, is responsible for shutting down game servers that have been empty for some time.\n\nThe integration of autoscaling with matchmaking and the separation of concerns between the Admiral (scaling up) and Agones (scaling down) has served us very well and has managed to provide us with shock absorption to the game when things didn’t go as planned. Several times, the elasticity of these queues between maps have saved the team from having to bring down the game entirely to fix issues during misaligned deployments or unforeseen behaviors during load spikes.\n\nThis screenshot shows the view of the game servers fleet from the Admiral. Each line is really two lines: one for the “desired size” and another for the “actual size”. This information is used to tell the cloud orchestrator to spin up more game servers for a particular map type as they are needed by players being matched to servers that don’t yet exist.\n\nData Management\n\nOur architecture of loosely coupled software components wouldn’t be very useful without data flowing between them and being persisted, validated, or aggregated.\n\nDatabases\n\nOne of the most difficult elements of creating a shared perpetual world is constructing the ability for players to influence it (and one another) in a context that feels immediate and consistent. A key factor to provide a positive player experience is the choice of the database architecture.\n\nWe decided to use ScyllaDB as our main data persistence layer. ScyllaDB is a C++ rewrite of Apache Cassandra (originally created at Facebook and, in turn, heavily influenced by Google BigTable and Amazon DynamoDB), a distributed column store.\n\nThe biggest advantage of ScyllaDB for us has been its elastic scalability and its cloud native “design for failure” posture that aligned very well with ours. One significant advantage of ScyllaDB for us is the ability to attach replication strategy to a table but eventual consistency levels to a query. This gives us a lot of flexibility because in some cases we need consistency more than we need speed and we can tune that directly at the query level. This is not possible with traditional relational databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL.\n\nThis functionality is crucial, for example, when dealing with a persistent player state: we want the data to be replicated on multiple computers before we return a response to the game server. This means that both the game server and multiple database nodes have to die (at the very same time!) for that player state update to get lost. As far as we can tell, this has never happened.\n\nWe also use PostgreSQL (hosted for us by AWS) for the catalog of our outfits available for purchase in the game. We used a relational database here because we felt it was better suited for this particular job.\n\nAsynchronous Messaging\n\nAnother important part of the data management layer is the ability of software components to message one another asynchronously.\n\nWe have two of such busses:\n\nThe first for aggregates and collects telemetry for player behavior (which uses Apache Kafka, more on this later) and feeds our analytics and machine learning pipelines.\n\nAnother coordinates software components (for example, the control plane between the fleet auto-scaler and the game servers). This uses EMQX as the broker and MQTT as the protocol.\n\nWhy two? Mostly because they serve different purposes, have different strengths and weaknesses, and are managed by different teams focusing on separate outcomes. There might be value in consolidating things further in the future, but for now this separation is serving us well.\n\nSpotlight: MQTT and Apache ActiveMQ v5 (aka Artemis)\n\nThe use of MQTT as the message bus protocol for our game servers control planes was decided precisely to isolate us from lock-in of a particular broker implementation. In retrospect, this was a weak choice: MQTT is an IoT protocol and we were attracted by the fact that it was designed for devices with small power and low bandwidth. We wanted a solution that would be easy and cheap for the game servers to interact with and didn’t consume a lot of their resources.\n\nUnfortunately, many MQTT brokers simply implemented that protocol on top of their existing native systems. We picked Apache ActiveMQ v5 (aka Artemis) because it was established and it supported v5 of the MQTT protocol (which offered features we needed) but was written and designed before clouds existed and turned out to be incompatible with our preferred “loosely coupled components expected to fail” architectural posture.\n\nArtemis has been the source of much apprehension and tribulation. We ended up having to patch the software to fit our needs. We operated with a forked version in production just to keep it from falling over regularly (the MQTT layer and cross-regional federation layers did not work well together).\n\nWe have since migrated to EMQX which is a more modern MQTT broker, designed from the ground-up with MQTT in mind and we have not looked back.\n\nThe lesson learned here is that even established and battle-tested software might still end up performing poorly when utilized in a different context and with different operational constraints than was originally intended.\n\nData Pipelines\n\nAnother important principle of our software architecture is that we want to be able to observe and monitor how the system is behaving so that we can act on it effectively when behavior deviates from the norm.\n\nWe treat data differently based on whether the decision making that it supports is latency sensitive or not. In fact, we use completely different systems for low-latency decision support (seconds to minutes) vs. high-latency (days or weeks).\n\nSpotlight: player behavior vs. system behavior\n\nIn the past, we separated data based on whether it was about player behavior or software behavior. But we quickly realized that distinction was not very helpful in practice.\n\nFor example, a purchasing event from a player is technically a player behavior and insights gathered from them influence strategic decision making with high-latency (days or weeks). But such a high-latency reaction would be detrimental to both our players and our revenue if we didn’t get notified immediately if the frequency of purchases dropped outside of the normal range of operation.\n\nIt is generally true that data generated from the behavior of players influences decision making in aggregate and with high latency while events generated by the behavior of software systems influences decisions and actions that require quick reaction times. But our ability to route data based on decision making latency needs and not on the semantics of origin has made it easier to reason about data routing decisions, especially when the two pipelines are handled by different teams with different skills, strengths, and goals.\n\nObservability\n\nWe picked Prometheus as the time-series database powering the low-latency data pipeline and alerting. The key advantage here is the “pull” model in which it is Prometheus to “scrape” data from our software components, which makes it a lot simpler to maintain.\n\nWe also use Grafana as our visual dashboarding system querying the data stored in Prometheus along with Loki and Tempo to deal textual logs and tracing the flow of execution across several of our software components.\n\nLastly, we use Sloth to automate the generation of SLOs.\n\nAnalytics\n\nThe high-latency data pipeline revolves around Apache Kafka (managed for us by Confluent) which captures and routes the data as well as Apache Spark (managed for us by Databricks), which we use to aggregate and analyze the data.\n\nWe use Apache Airflow (managed for us by Astronomer) for monitoring and scheduling long-running workflows for data aggregation and analysis. Lastly, we use Tableau to power the visualization of the insights that result from our data analysis.\n\nCloud Infrastructure\n\nAnother development challenge is the “free-to-play” nature of our distribution strategy. This approach made it difficult to predict the amount of players that would play the game, especially around key events, such as platform launches, major updates, and in-game events.\n\nWe decided to be “cloud native” from the start because “elasticity” in supply of computation and bandwidth is a key advantage that cloud providers have over acquiring and maintaining our own server infrastructure; especially for gaming startups (for which capital is constrained) and when deploying across multiple geographical regions.\n\nCloud native for us didn’t simply mean: “run our programs on somebody else’s computer.” Cloud native for us meant designing a software architecture composed of small pieces that are loosely coupled and always expected to fail.\n\nWe call this “designing for failure.” Of course, we never want our systems to fail. However, we believe that resiliency in software systems comes less from preventing failure, and more from providing mitigations to such risks and the ability to restore service as quickly and automatically as possible. We want to design to reduce failure but we always expect it to happen, so when it does happen, our systems would not be surprised by it.\n\nKey components of this strategy were using Kubernetes as our orchestration system, Linkerd as our service mesh, Traefik as our load balancer and Agones to manage our fleet of game servers. We also rely heavily on the “infrastructure as code” principle, using Kustomize to help us keep our configurations DRY and ArgoCD to power continuous deployments.\n\nKubecost helps us measure costs, and we recently swapped from cluster-autoscaler to Karpenter to optimize cluster elasticity and to help pick the best server instances. This change allowed us to save a non-trivial percentage of our cloud costs by automating the selection of instance types to use to run our workloads.\n\nFor provisioning infrastructure we rely on Terraform and Spacelift. We rely on Vault to store secrets without our cloud environments. We also conduct chaos testing using Litmus.\n\nAnd we rely on a few different services for authentication and authorization systems, including FusionAuth for account management, Zendesk for customer support management, Stripe for payment processing, and Vivox for our in-game chat system.\n\nOur only cloud provider is Amazon Web Services which provides us computers, storage, and bandwidth across multiple regions: United States, Germany, and Japan. We also rely on Cloudflare for geo-aware DNS and load balancing as well as DDoS protection.\n\nSpotlight: Nomad vs. Kubernetes\n\nWe had originally chosen Nomad as our orchestration solution, mostly because it was perceived to be conceptually simpler and it was much more compatible with Windows workloads (which we thought we might need for testing purposes).\n\nUnfortunately, Nomad had one very significant problem: the momentum of the development community around it was significantly smaller than around Kubernetes. This had two significant issues for us: a) we had to develop in-house solutions that the community around Kubernetes had already implemented; and b) it was harder to engage the team with a technology that many considered an evolutionary dead-end.\n\nWe made the difficult call to switch our cloud orchestration system by using the argument that our development velocity would significantly improve and our operational risks would be reduced. This turned out to be very much the case and it’s a decision we would happily make again.\n\nBuild Systems\n\nThere are two primary concepts used in the building of Palia and its supporting services: the build platform and the build system. Historically, game studios lumped these two together around the primary continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) component. We borrowed some plays from large-scale build and release systems beyond gaming: using a heavily distributed approach inspired by some of our team members’ experiences in other industries, such as banking.\n\nTo power the build system we use Jenkins, but take care to draw a distinction between the software, and the underlying infrastructure upon which it runs and integrates. While related, these things are best served by intentional, separate configuration management and Infrastructure as Code practices which can quickly become unwieldy and complex if attempting to do so under a monolithic design. The result is a hybrid cloud approach to the build system. We use both an on-prem data center and Amazon Web Services, and one side of the architecture can be maintained without potentially negatively impacting the other.\n\nWe also took the time to redesign the initial version of the build system (Jenkins pipelines) around Unreal Engine’s native tooling, namely, BuildGraph. Doing so required a lot of work up-front as the old method was cobbled together between Jenkins Pipelines and Python scripts, but the declarative nature of BuildGraph tooling has allowed us to increase correctness, reduce build system maintenance, and increase flexibility such that we can build almost every target platform with minimal specific changes for each. A key component of this success was integrating with AutoSDK and creating a “standard library” of sorts in Jenkins to glue it all together.\n\nIn our latest version of the build platform we are able to mostly dynamically scale the number of executors based on demand. The build system can then simply act as a “glue layer” to distribute requested tasks among the available executors as parallel pipeline runs. Further, we’ve incorporated designing for Self-Service by other teams, such that they can “pick and choose” which artifacts they want built via a single interface. We call this the “Prime Pipeline,” which presents a series of configurable parameters and then schedules the running of “Sub-Pipelines” to do the work, passing those parameters as appropriate. This means that via the same Prime Pipeline interface, one Engineer could choose to build only one Platform Client from the library of Clients available, and one Server, getting only those two artifacts; or they could select everything and end up with every Client and Server we currently offer as targets.\n\nSpotlight: Capacity Management in a Hybrid Cloud World\n\nA trade-off we make for this level of granularity and distribution is the initial difficulty in managing capacity. We use several build executors of different types and had to really break-down our pipelines and how each stage would be distributed to the executors both on-prem and in AWS. Then we had to measure a single run of each pipeline to get more accurate numbers to use for calculating instance sizes, costs, expected load, and timings for stage and whole pipeline execution. This cost us a lot of time up-front, and while we are glad we did it, it is yet another piece of operational overhead which must be monitored, reviewed, and adjusted in order to remain reasonably accurate. Changing something as simple as the Node Label of a particular pipeline Stage can have serious impacts to all of the metrics we measure, most notably, build times. Unfortunately, there aren't a whole lot of “drop-in” or “off-the-shelf” solutions for these types of systems, so we have had to track these things manually, and then automate as we go to attempt to reduce the operational burden.\n\nFurthermore, managing two different sets of infrastructure is not for the faint of heart, or those unfamiliar with Hybrid Cloud management. While the patterns may be very similar, the implementation proved to be a lot more work than we anticipated.\n\nFor example, AWS and other cloud service providers make APIs available to interact on a very granular level with their exposed components. On the other end of the spectrum, even the most mature on-prem infrastructure providers rely on their own custom tooling for managing hardware components. This is why projects such as Ansible are in such heavy use in the IT industry, and S6 is no exception here as we prioritize the use of open source tools where possible to ease cognitive load and keep costs low.\n\nThe challenge that made this most difficult was the disparity in experience using this approach on our team members’ time. Some of us come from more of a Platforming background, others from a Tooling background, and still others from primarily a Jenkins Pipeline writing background. This is great for general cross-functionality within the team, but requires careful planning to execute well even among the highest-performing teams.\n\nVersion Control\n\nWe use two different version control systems to manage the development lifecycle of our code: Perforce for the game code, and git (hosted in Bitbucket) for everything else.\n\nUsing different version control systems is clearly suboptimal and not a decision we took lightly: git is generally preferred by backend engineers and is far better supported by modern development environments.\n\nUnfortunately, Perforce is very well integrated in Unreal Engine because that’s what Epic Games uses (the makers of Unreal Engine). Also, git isn’t really designed to work with very large binary files, and a lot of our in-game assets and original sources are giant binary files. Perforce works well in these situations.\n\nEarly on, we tried using git-lfs (large file storage), which is supposed to help with this problem but we gave up when we realized how much effort it would be to retrofit all of the Epic development tools (UnrealGameSync, for example) to work with git.\n\nWe sincerely wish we had a single consolidated version control system and code review workflow, but it is not a trivial exercise.\n\nSpotlight: Consolidated Repos\n\nOne of the issues we faced with git was that it was too easy and convenient to create new repositories, causing a proliferation of them. The biggest issue we faced was the inability to make changes that cross-cut different services at once. This created a lot of production overhead and reduced our ability to consolidate the behavior of services.\n\nWe considered switching to a full “monorepo” but many of us were unfamiliar with it and feared additional complexity and overhead that we had no additional development capacity to support.\n\nThe compromise we reached was a handful of consolidated repos in which many individual git repositories were merged into a single repository and then archived. All the microservices ended up in this single repository, but they could be developed, built, tested and deployed in isolation. This made it much easier to modify code across services (such as version dependencies) as well as simplifying the creation of libraries. This approach facilitated an incremental externalization of common functionality into modules that could be more easily reused across services, reducing copy/paste code duplication and reducing our maintenance costs.\n\nSaaS-y Open Source\n\nOne common theme you might have noticed in our architecture is that we prefer to depend on software that is open source and that we could host ourselves if we wanted/needed to. We also prefer to rely on a SaaS vendor that provides and manages this software for us instead of running it ourselves.\n\nThis offers us several advantages:\n\nWe are not locked into a particular cloud or vendor provider (as we could run the system ourselves if we needed to).\n\nWe can provision systems more quickly (our people don’t need to learn the intricacies of configuring them).\n\nLeverage vendor expertise to fix issues and/or edge cases when we encounter them.\n\nKeeps the vendor prices under control under our threat of shutting down our vendor contract and hosting the system ourselves.\n\nWe deviated from this posture only rarely and when there was no open source alternative that made sense for our business needs. However, we do believe this paradigm worked well for us and provides a way to fund and support further development of these open source projects. This, in turn, lowers our future risks by helping make the development of these open projects more sustainable (as these hosting vendors often employ contributors to the open source projects and continue to fund their contributions for mutually symbiotic benefit).\n\nConclusions\n\nIt’s rare to get access to the source code that makes up video games, so it’s rare to have the opportunity to learn directly from it. Even rarer is a view into the decisions and tradeoffs, the lessons learned, the paths not taken and those taken but with later regret.\n\nWe hope that this deep-dive on the challenges and successes of creating Palia’s software architecture provides some insight and inspiration for others facing similar challenges.\n\nIf you have any questions about Palia’s software architecture and development, or simply if you want to start a conversation feel free to reach out to us at hello@singularity6.com.\n\nSpecial Thanks\n\nThe list of people that contributed to this architecture is very long (see the Palia credits for the full list) and we wouldn’t do it justice to replicate it here.

      "# [Sixer Game Night 2024: A Night of Neon, Nostalgia, And Non](https://www.singularity6.com/news/sixer-game-night-2024)\nLast week, the Palian moons aligned for Sixers who participated in Sixer Game Night, an epic soirée where Singularity 6 stormed arcades in LA, Seattle, Chicago, and Las Vegas. The vibe was electric as the team gathered to celebrate our love for games, both digital and analog.\n\nThe festivities kicked off with a culinary homage to our childhood favorites. The menu was a mouthwatering spread of comfort food classics: pigs-in-a-blankey, chicken tendies, yummy sliders, mountains of crispy truffle fries, and fruit to stave off scurvy (Arrr!). And what's a Game Night without a few libations to toast our collective camaraderie of creativity?\n\nIt wouldn’t be a Sixer celebration without a lil’ Karaoke; that age-old tradition of belting out tunes with the confidence of Vanilla Ice (regardless of actual singing ability, of course). Several Sixers grabbed (and dropped!) the mic, belting out ballads known and niche. Several smart watches warned against heightened decibel levels. But “In The End,” “I Want It That Way.”\n\nOf course, Singularity 6 is a video game studio, and it’s the arcade where Sixers truly shined. The simulated dance battles were fierce, with team members stepping, hopping, and jumping in a mesmerizing dance of rhythm and coordination-ish. And the kart races were a sight to behold, with friendly rivalries emerging as racers chucked red, green, and blue (!!!) shells across the track for several photo-finish victories (to most folks’ chagrin). A surprise fishing game left us ‘reeling’ after reeling-in some outrageously-sized Tuna. And let's not forget the claw machine – a test of patience and precision as Sixers collected an army of ducks that now embellish several studio workspaces.\n\nBut beyond the games, the laughter, and the sheer joy of human connection; Sixer Game Night was a reflection of what makes Singularity 6 so special. It's the people – our team – who bring their passion, creativity, and enthusiasm to everything we do, whether it's crafting Palia’s next big feature, or quacking about their latest toy waterfowl.\n\nAs the night wound down and we said our goodbyes, it was clear that Game Night wasn't just about playing games. It was about building memories, strengthening bonds, and celebrating the incredible community that is Singularity 6. Here's to many more nights of neon, nostalgia, and nonstop fun.",

      "# [Meet Our Environment Artist, Maya](https://www.singularity6.com/news/meet-our-environment-artist-maya)\nAs Sixers, we like to showcase our small, yet mighty team and highlight their amazing abilities. This month, we’re introducing a few of our employees who are hard at work making our dream for a virtual society happen.\n\nMaya Mahalingam\n\nMaya joined S6 last year as our Environment Artist. She has a strong passion for art and was encouraged early on to explore these skills. Check out her work on ArtStation!\n\nGet to know Maya by reading our conversation with Maya below!\n\nHow did you get started in this profession and what drew you to a career as an artist (no pun intended)?\n\nI have been super passionate about art ever since as a kid, and I loved to draw and paint. I was always very sure that I wanted to pursue a creative career and do something different, so I did a Visual communication bachelors to figure out where my interest was. During my childhood, I remember playing a lot of GTA and NES games after school which fueled my curiosity even more. And so, I ended up working as an artist at a mobile game company and I really enjoyed the experience. I kept up to date on trends and looking into tools that are constantly changing in the 3D space and became super interested in VR. So, I came to the US to further my career and expand my knowledge by doing a Game Dev program at Carnegie Mellon. Since then, I've had the opportunity to work with multiple teams across games, VR and AR space for the past few years.\n\nWhen you were younger, how did you discover a passion for art?\n\nWhen I was growing up, I played tennis professionally for a while and art was like my side interest due to lack of time. But I still enjoyed going to art classes a lot. My parents really encouraged me to explore my creativity and I started painting and doodling whenever I could.\n\nWhat excites you most about being an Environment Artist?\n\nWhat I really like about environment art is that I get to translate my real world observations and bring them to life directly. And, the other nice thing about being an environment artist specifically is that I get to touch a lot of topics in the pipeline, be it technical or purely art itself because of the nature of the role. That I think widens my knowledge and interest of continuing to learn and grow. Also, I've found a recent love to write and share the process about my work and here's my last one: https://80.lv/articles/001agt-005cg-crafting-a-mossy-oakwood-forest-in-ue4-at-cgma/. I wish to continue to do more of that through personal work and our game here at S6.\n\nWhat brought you to LA / S6?\n\nIt was a combination of my interest in environment art, and looking to relocate to LA for personal reasons. So S6 was a great opportunity to be able to do both. I wanted to try something new and different after having worked in VR/AR projects, I wanted to work on a project where I could create a vibrant virtual environment that the players could spend hours exploring and having fun.\n\nWhat have you learned about yourself since becoming an artist?\n\nI think over the years I've learnt how much I can push myself to face challenges and try out new things. I've become more comfortable with accepting what I don't know and what I can do to fix that. And, definitely to be a good person, because at the end of day I think that's what counts.\n\nWhat things in life are still a mystery to you?\n\nHaha the question itself is a big mystery to me. Honestly, I see myself as a mystery because I'm still constantly trying to figure out my traits, my interests and where I'm heading towards in life. So, having to learn about myself and finding solutions for the questions in my head has been really interesting so far.\n\nOf the many things you do, which one makes your heart beat the fastest?\n\nArt! I think if you make something that you enjoy and if it’s something that people find fascinating then that's something to work on with pride.\n\nWhat are you currently working on, without giving anything away?\n\nCurrently I'm working on getting the different aspects of environment art as close to the art bible as possible. And, I’m working on getting Houdini engine setup for some procedural modeling integrated into our pipeline for customizable options in game.\n\nWhat is the one thing in life that makes you happiest?\n\nFirst thing that comes to mind is good food, especially dessert! I can literally eat a Tiramisu or a cake any time. If I am not eating a cake then I am probably baking or thinking about one :D\n\nFor aspiring kids who want to be an artist/designer one day, what advice would you give them?\n\nI would say following your passion is what brings the best out of you. Other than that if it has to be specific to becoming an artist, I would say keep yourself updated constantly. Train yourself to be in a position to be super adaptable to whichever tools become the standard. The industry changes constantly, so having a lot of self discipline and motivation I think is very important. And to make some time to work on personal projects cause I think that really helps to shine a light on your interest.",

      "# [Finding Home: Social Matchmaking Through Machine Learning](https://www.singularity6.com/news/finding-home-social-matchmaking-through-machine-learning)\nI grew up in a small town - so small that it technically qualifies as a village. To describe this to others, I quote my father’s favorite fact: “there are thirty times more cows here than there are people.” Depending on who you are, that may or may not sound appealing. Yet, another aspect of this community was more universally captivating - the feeling of being in a place where you truly belong.\n\nAs my education and career progressed, I made my way up the chain from cities to the dog-eat-dog world of metropolises. With each move, that strong sense of community support and inclusion in my hometown slowly faded away. It was easy to get lost in the millions in these larger places and feel like another number.\n\nOnline user bases, such as those present in video games, can quickly reach a population in the tens to hundreds of millions, surpassing the largest cities’ size. One of our goals at Singularity 6 is to create a world that brings us closer together, not further apart, which makes solving the large-scale problem of “community” vital to us.\n\n\"How do we design a social experience for millions of players while also connecting them in meaningful ways?\"\n\nIn video games, the exploration of in-depth algorithmic solutions to optimize the social experience remains limited. However, the problem has not gone entirely untouched, as many social media platforms leverage services with machine learning components to solve similar problems. With a few modifications, these systems should work in the gaming space as well.\n\nFor example, link prediction, the problem of predicting a link between two entities in a network, is a standard tool for increasing connectedness in networks; if a system can accurately assist a user in finding relevant acquaintances, their likelihood of continuing to use the service increases. Unfortunately, the problem is somewhat different and more difficult in the gaming space; players are often anonymous and, if playing socially, generally choose to play with an explicit group of friends. In other words, the connectedness of the entire player graph is sparse compared to an average network.\n\nIn this case, the problem is partially about predicting those existing relationships and more about curating new ones. Can we learn the interactions that create a positive perception of other players? Can we incentivize our system to reinforce those positive interactions by increasing the chance that those players will meet again soon? With time, we can ensure that each player is automatically added to the best community for them when returning to the game.\n\n\"The problem is partially about predicting those existing relationships and more about curating new one.\"\n\nWhile that task itself may sound daunting, there is good news on the business front. For some social apps (i.e., dating), a conflict arises with exactly how good a matchmaking service should be. If you build a well-optimized matchmaking service, it may hinder user retention, and if you throw together a scrappy solution, you may not get users in the first place. For social gaming, this trade-off between user experience and business performance is mostly absent. Without that tension, we can build a high-quality matchmaking service that will strengthen player bonds and impact the business in a meaningful way. Finding win-wins such as this is a motivating force for everyone here at Singularity 6.\n\nFor me, I hope to rekindle that sense of community I lost long ago and share that experience with others. I want to help build that safe, secure space that anyone can go to when they feel alone or when the world is a bit too chaotic. I invite you to follow Singularity 6 on this journey, the best one of all, the one of finding home.\n\n-Riley Howsden, Machine Learning",
      "# [How Gaming Together Can Build Studio Culture](https://www.singularity6.com/news/how-gaming-together-can-build-studio-culture)\nPlaying games together is a worthwhile, meaningful pursuit.\n\nThis is a core tenet of Singularity 6's culture, and one of the ways it manifests is in our weekly gaming hour. Every Wednesday, at 6 PM, all S6 employees are invited to come together to play multiplayer games. Everyone is free to play any game they like - some play board games like Race for the Galaxy, Root, or Riichi Mahjong - others play action games like Overwatch, Among Us, or Deep Rock Galactic.\n\nGaming hour is great for letting people interact with co-workers they might not work with regularly\n\nDiscord is great for coordinating game nights, as well as sharing plenty of pictures of professional model and goodest of boys, Mochi.\n\nGaming hour is our opportunity to relax and unwind, but it's also an opportunity to interact and connect with our coworkers outside of typical work functions. You can get to know a person by playing together, be it overcoming game obstacles or engaging in friendly competition. Gaming hour is great for letting people interact with co-workers they might not work with regularly, letting them get to know people outside of their immediate team. It’s also an opportunity to discover games we might not otherwise have tried, and expands our knowledge of the gaming world while having fun.\n\nGiven the current pandemic that has us all working from home, having activities that bring us together gives us opportunities to interact. Gaming hour gives people a reason to get into voice chat and socialize on a regular basis. Since gaming hour is an official company event, people can participate without feeling guilty for taking time away from work - it’s part of our schedule because we believe that playing games together is a worthwhile, meaningful pursuit.",

      "# [We are Singularity 6!](https://www.singularity6.com/news/we-are-singularity-6)\nWe are Singularity 6 and we believe games are more than just simple entertainment.\n\nVideo games have ignited our creativity, connected us to broader communities, and helped us forge lifelong friendships. If you’re reading this, chances are some of your best memories have been made with either a keyboard and mouse or a controller in hand.\n\nWhen they’re at their best, games unite us and help us create shared and impactful memories.\n\n“When I was growing up, my grandmother was such a titanic figure in my life, in part because of the game experiences we shared together.” Game Director Aidan Karabaich explains, “whether it was her besting me at Pac-Man for the 100th time or reveling in a new NES game we were trying to beat together for the first time, games brought us together in a way no other medium could.”\n\nMeaningful experiences, like Aidan’s, have been a part of all our stories here at Singularity 6. Games have played such a crucial part in our lives that we wove our love for them, and for what they could be, into the very core of our studio. Our mission is to forge alternate worlds that deepen players’ lives.\n\nFor a little over three years, we have been recruiting industry veterans who share this ambitious mission. Today, our team includes top talent with experience at big studios like Blizzard Entertainment, Epic Games, and Riot Games; among others. Although many of us have never met face to face due to the pandemic, we have been playing games to connect and build bonds with one another. This has further demonstrated to us the importance of games that help connect people all over the world, and strengthened our commitment to creating these experiences for others.\n\nWith the announcement of Palia, we are on the path to making our vision a reality. Palia is a community simulation MMO set in a high fantasy world. This cozy world invites you to build a life possible only in your dreams while making new friends along the way. You can learn more about the game here.\n\n“Palia creates a lot of opportunities to bring players together and that’s one of the things I’m looking forward to the most,” says Community Lead Edaleen Cruz. “I can’t wait to hear all those stories about friendships that began in Palia.”\n\nGames can help us live life twice as good and if that resonates with you, we invite you to join us on this adventure.",

I've played this game almost 100 hours now and while I did enjoy playing it I probably won't play for much longer. Once I got to Exquisite Level Tools it got unplayable for me personally. I am extremely introverted and I like solo playing games. I don't like talking in game chat and will do everything I can to avoid it so once you reach the stage where you need an insane amount of Flow Wood Planks then I can't really enjoy playing anymore. I don't want to have to constantly call out for help to grind flow trees that are uncuttable without a group to make cute furniture. Clothes cost ~$30 or more a set, pets are something like $15 and you can't get them any other way but through the premium shop. Crops take at least 3 hours of real time to grow with watering in between and if they aren't watered their growth pauses so no planting and logging back in later to collect. Takes an hour to process a single crop to increase it's value and you're limited to 9 plots of soil (9 plots w/ 9 spaces so 81 crops total) so you can't really grind crops for money quickly. There is also no way to trade other players or give things away to another person. You can make a request for an item you've already obtained but not one you haven't gotten yourself before and you can't ask a specific person to fill the request. Overall it's cute and a fun game to kill some time but I don't want to be forced to interact with people just to continue playing.",

To me it feels like a mobile game on PC.\r\n\r\nI guess if you like to build a house, this game is OK, but even then there are games that have much better base building AND have a lot more to do otherwise. I would give it a 3/10 - there's nothing that makes you want to continue playing the game. If nothing interesting happens during the first 5 hours of a game, i feel like it's already lacking.

You can play solo or get to know others and do activities together.\n\nIt shines in the art of home design, perfect for those who delight in crafting beautiful spaces.\n\nYou must know, this may be repetitive for some with its grinding mechanics. You will have to decide if it’s your thing or not, but the game is free and there aren’t any imbalances between players. You only buy cosmetics that do not influence game progression.\n\nIt has its own Wiki in case you find it hard to understand what to do, and the community is pretty helpful as well. Just ask your questions in chat, and they'll guide you.\n\n[h3] [u] It's unfinished, so it's not perfect, but it's still pretty good. [/u] [/h3]\n\nOccasionally buggy, loot can sometimes get stuck in the ground, which can be annoying. This happened to me while I was trying to catch a Rainbow-Tipped Butterfly, if I remember correctly. I spent a long time searching for it, only to find it stuck and unavailable for pickup afterward.\n\nI don't find certain puzzles in the story quests engaging; they could use some improvements, but it's not enough to make me stop playing.\n\nYour character moves rather oddly at times, especially when running short distances or climbing. These areas could benefit from some visual and physics enhancements.\n\nAnd a few other quirks scattered about.\n\n[b] I played Palia before it was on Steam, so I have more hours invested than it shows here.

      "https://steam/76561198002973871": "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-20)](https://steam/76561198002973871)\nThis game fails to deliver on it's genre.\nI would have rather paid like 25 bucks for the game instead of it being free if it made all the difference in quality.\n\nThe graphics are less that sub par using the bland washed out cartoon breath of the wild or genshin impact style, except theres no cell shading or graphical effects. The sky doesnt even have any effects for the sun or clouds. The sky is just a blank dome with a 2D image of 4 clouds that rotate on an axis 24 hours a day indefinitely. The skybox is also a low resolution texture of a mountain that you can see the rough pixel edges of without even zooming in. There are no weather effects. You don't get season changes, rain, snow, fog, anything like that.\n\nCrafting is less than rewarding. Your tools have durability and break, upgrading them costs a fortune and hardly make a difference. For example, upgrading a pick axe still requires the same number of hits to destroy rocks because it goes by damage instead of gathering time. Crafting is automated by machines that you are limited by inventory space and time to use.\n\nThe game is also severely lacking in content and full of nearly game breaking bugs, including tools failing to equip, broken animation loops, and quest descriptions that stick and overwrite newer quest descriptions. These are just a tiny few of the bugs.\n\nBug catching is a nightmare. instead of using a net, you have to forage and craft these items that copied pokemon pokeballs, which all have a small chance of successfully capturing the bugs. you can often throw up to 6 or even 8 of these at a single bug and still not catch it. The bugs dont even sell for enough money to pay for the materials used to capture said bugs.\n\nThe NPCs personalities are all very dry and you cannot actually have conversations with them, you are able to interact with them less than you can NPCs in a game like skyrim. They only talk to you when you want to, and its on par with the characters from Animal Crossing.\n\nIn fact everything in this game feels like a cheapened imitation of Animal Crossing, you roam around collecting or trying to grind for things to make pennies on the thousands of dollars it takes to upgrade your house space. Everything is time gated. There is hardly any content in the game at all, there are no big areas to explore, no combat, no dungeons with treasure, and not even any tools to socialize or express yourself with other players.\n\nThat is probably where the game drops the ball the hardest is with player interaction. There are very few clothing options in the game and they all look the same and have some kind of paisley pattern you cannot get rid of. (Paisley is the kind of pattern you find on bandannas irl.) They also want you to spend upwards of 16 to 30 dollars on a single outfit which are mostly comprised of just a shirt and pants. You cannot layer clothing, accessorize, paint or dye your clothing, its either you get it the way it is from the shop and thats it. There are also no players interacting or having conversations in town. They're all just grinding out resources and money. This is probably because theres no chat bubbles, chat console hides itself so you cannot even casually read server chat, and there arent ways to engage or hang out with nearby players. You cannot even sit on furniture in the town, much less go down to the tavern in the game and have a meal with your friends, even though there is a tavern. The character animations are very stiff and robotic, from the idle, running...and thats really the only animations your characters do. They dont really seem alive. They don't stretch, yawn, look around, or transition into other animations well at all. When you go from a hard sprint into standing again, theres about 3 frames inbetween, it looks about at rough as T-posing.\n\nThe housing system. This is the big one, probably the only part of the game where most of the budget went into. You can tell they tried to put some effort into this but its still roughly designed and not executed well. For example, you can build walls for your house so its not just one big room, the walls only go halfway up to the ceiling, you can place a wall near the ceiling instead and leave a gap near the floor big enough for you to walk through, but you cannot stack two walls on top of eachother because the ceiling height is exactly one grid space lower than the height of 2 wall pieces. so you cannot build rooms in your home.If you try to make them overlap instead, there is a massive space between the layers. Containers are cosmetic only and non-functional, you also cannot put furniture wherever you want. Want to put a flower pot on top of your dresser? you can't. Want to put up wallpaper? only for the bottom half of the wall. Want to hang things from the ceiling? you can't. Want to add a window in the corner? you can't. Want to change the walls of your house or the shape of them to not just be a big cube? you can't. Want to have a flower garden? you can't. Fireplace? no. Cupboard with items? no. You cannot do anything detailed with your house leaving it forced to look unlived in, cobbwebbs would look more believable at home in your house than a person living there.\n\nGames that did housing better than Palia and arent even life sim games: Black Desert, Elder scrolls online, Animal Crossing, Minecraft, 7 Days to Die, Raft, Craftopia, Legends of Aria, Phantasy Star Online 2.\n\nIn summary, Nothing this game has as a feature really feels in depth or immersive. You cannot specialize in a field of crafting, theres not even that many things to craft, player interaction just isnt even there (not even for roleplay.)\n\nIf i had to come up with an analogy for this game, its being thirsty and trying to enjoy a glass of water, but the cup is like 90% ice and you're constantly slurping and shaking the glass and waiting for the ice to melt to get a tiny sip and just give up and walk away thirsty when theres a full glass of water for FREE around any other corner.",

This review is personal yet vague enough and sorry I am not going to go into the \"whys\" of some of this review as it's again personal stuff. Just simply, my own review. This most likely will change in the future as the game develops more...\nAnyhow, okay, time for my weird and honest review:\n\n1., I love this game. It is quite addicting. It reminds me of a mixture of games, including a much older game that I grew up with that unfortunately has been shut down long when I was still young. Seeing a game with a similar-ish style and playstyle really allows me to get into this game. To me, I'd say the games are close enough and may even get more similar things added!\n\n2. Relaxing. Very relaxing. I like building games like these where you build your life from the ground up. \n\n3.  I am epileptic along with other things. And can I just say how much I ADORE there for once being a warning something???\nNot just a warning, but a warning that gives you useful ideas and instructions and really just encourages being healthy and safe! Just having a warning there to begin with really puts me at ease and shows that they care. I've talked to devs that have pretty much told epileptics \"oh, sucks to be you. Why should we cater for you?\" and that can make the world honestly feel even more lonely. I mean I get there is a whole debate that could happen right now from what I am about to say, but hey, why not just put a quick warning in your games? Like how hard is that? Or just not be lazy and make decent lighting...\nBut, I am not here to complain. I LIKE THIS GAME BECAUSE THEY TRY TO MAKE IT A GAME EVERYONE CAN ENJOY. And for the photosensitivity stuff, I give this game an A+ from me.\nBy the way,\nI have seen some *weird* stuff flash in and out in the game, but that's really just new game bugs that sometimes just aren't preventable. As for ME, I find the game's lighting and sensitivities and all to be pretty okay. I can't speak for everyone who is photosensitive, but I can say for myself the game is fairly good with that. The character creation screen *may* be sensitive to some, so just make sure to look or keep turned away away at the start of that during the dialogue until it is over.\nSeriously though, thanks for adding this.\n\n4. Einar asked how my day was, I was having a bad day and said so ingame to him, and he gave me a shiny rock to make me feel better. That actually made my day a bit better. Thanks.\n\n5. Unfortunately (due to the next thing), I can't get too much into the lore, but I wish I could. This game is full of diverse characters and quests. I love the worldbuilding and CHARACTER BUILDING especially that the devs put into this game! Very nicely done and not at all unnoticed!\n\n(the next one is a bit personal and super weird and specific and for summary, is just me blabbing about how much I dislike the game shoving humanity down my throat. So if that confuses you, just skip it)\n6., \n[spoiler]Personally I really dislike how much into humanity this game goes. I haven't fully played the quest and keep skipping the dialogue as I am someone who cannot connect to humanity in the slightest. With a game with humanoids and robots, and I am STUCK as a human in a fantasy world, I find it incredibly discouraging. If it has lore like this game, I'd want a game that focuses more on BEING AN INDIVIDUAL and not humanity. Playing as a human is overused and I really can't connect or even care about the plot because it's so centered around humanity and is constantly down your throat about it. Again I understand this is a weird opinion, but I prefer the idea of focusing more on building an individual than clumping them with a species or whatever. Especially in a game that's meant to be an escape from reality. I don't want to be a human in fantasy, why would I want that? I don't want connection to the real world at all when I play games. I like escape. Helps dysphoria a lot and helps with stress---which is WHY I like games like this. Just none that are exactly like this game exist where I can play as a freaking robot or monster or even just a humanoid/inhuman thing (just stating for context, I mean more I'd be down for playing as one of the robots or something like that). I think this game could work on that, but again this is very much a personal addition to my review and simply something I more hope the devs see, probs not but who knows. Just saying, even like just a skin or removing the characters CONSTANTLY shoving humanity down my throat every chance they have would make this game PERFECT for me. Seriously, I can't stand the dialogue because all it does is talk about a topic I am already big no about.[/spoiler] \n\n----\nWhile I understand thew devs have their own visions and for all I know my own visions could be colliding with what this game is all about, I just wanted to state it. Again, maybe any complains from I or anyone will be seen and something will be added to accommodate. I mean heck, if they are by some miracle taking inspiration off of my all-time favourite game, they may add different formes you can become like skins or spells or something for at least the human problem. Again, it's still in beta so it's whatever. I still love the game and want to support it, even if my brain at the moment may not agree with it. (sorry)\n\nAnyhow, devs, keep up the great game",

I love that I can just pop in every few days and plant some plants, mine some ore, make some furniture, or to some quests for townsfolk. Getting to play with my family sometimes is also nice.\r\n\r\nI won't tell you that it revolutionizes anything, but I really appreciate their dedication to making a chill game where you can just play and there's no dying or PvP. (There's kind of PvE in that there's hunting, but that's also one-sided, and you're never at risk of taking damage.)\r\n\r\nThe story is pretty original and enjoyable so far.

The main issue is it takes a while to load and even when you finally load in, it doesn't necessarily load completely so there's some issues with assets and halting controls, but I have to acknowledge I'm playing on a fairly old gaming laptop, so it might work better for other people.",

      "https://steam/76561198146032683": "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-15)](https://steam/76561198146032683)\nI've played the game for awhile now but... I still can't decide whether it's a good game or not. Surely Palia has many activities and skills to improve, radiant graphics and more or less big world. The NPC are cute too.\nBut... It lack of something... I've tried to analyze it and I've came to this list:\n1. Lack of color. \nIt's maybe funny, but Palia, despite of all the cozy landscapes, are mostly in two colors. Green, blue, a little bit of orange. That's all. No more differences. All tree leaves (except the said orange ones) are green. All grass are green. Flowers are rare and hard to notice. I need more colors! More contrast! It's a forest after all, where all the beauty?\n2. The claustrophobia thing. \nYour house is located in a place surrounded by fence, by the forest AND by the mountains! Even location outside the city surrounded by the mountains! I know devs are trying to locate the end of the map by that, but PLEASE find another way, it making me sick by all this height above me! You could've add ocean, cliffs, I don't know, CANYONS, but all you choose is rocks. Booriiing! (Oh yeah sorry, forgot about one ocean in one part of the city, my dearest apologies)\n3. Maybe lack of realism.\nYou don't need to sleep, you don't need to eat, you even don't have any health bar. Wolfs are running from you, the night is as bright as a day, I didn't even notice any light sources. What's that, a child game? MAYBE, but no child game are providing killing animals with arrows and harvesting MEAT from it. Even if you try to disguise it with a bag, haha, you think children are stupid? Give adult people more hardcore, I want to feel the game and my character, not just run all day by some created 3D model that has no limits! Even Minecraft has limits (hunger it is)! \n\nIn the end, the game maaaaybe good to relax, but it doesn't provide anything more. You just need to run all day ('cause you don't need to sleep), harvest everything you can and do the quests. Which there a LOT. It feels like I'm on a job and have to work day, and day, and day, and day. The difference is that I receive money by that and here I receive only more quests :D I'm scared to even open my journal, cause it filled by them, but Palia is always reminding me about my job by showing all the quests in a right side of my monitor. It's scary... \n\nLong story short, it's a game about countless hours of run errands and visibility of freedom. If you tired of doing your real job, you can change it by doing virtual job! Thrilling, isn't it? If you like that assignment, please buy Palia! Otherwise, make your decision by more relaxing games.",

      "https://steam/76561199244176862": "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-16)](https://steam/76561199244176862)\nRating: 5/5\n\nOverview: Palia is a cozy, community-based MMO developed by Singularity 6, blending elements of life simulation and traditional MMORPG gameplay in a relaxing, laid-back environment. It offers an escape from the combat-heavy, fast-paced MMOs and instead focuses on activities like farming, fishing, crafting, and socializing. The game’s whimsical art style, charming world, and emphasis on collaboration over competition set it apart in a genre dominated by high-octane action.\n\nVisuals and Atmosphere: One of the strongest aspects of Palia is its visual presentation. The art style is bright, colorful, and reminiscent of Ghibli films, with lush forests, tranquil lakes, and detailed towns. The characters and environments are beautifully crafted, giving the game a whimsical, warm aesthetic that draws players in. The soundtrack complements this atmosphere perfectly, with gentle, calming music that helps maintain the relaxed pace.\n\nGameplay: Palia centers around life skills such as cooking, farming, fishing, and crafting. The game doesn't focus on combat or conflict, making it a relaxing experience for those looking for a more casual MMO. Players work together to build homes, gather resources, and complete quests that encourage collaboration rather than competition.\n\nThe progression system feels rewarding without being grindy. As players improve their skills, they unlock new recipes, tools, and customization options. The crafting and farming systems are intuitive, and the world provides ample opportunities to explore, gather resources, and discover new areas. However, after several hours, some players may find the gameplay loops repetitive, especially those who are accustomed to more complex MMOs.\n\nCommunity and Social Features: Palia shines in its social aspect. It encourages players to form friendships and work together on large projects. Community events and co-op activities foster a sense of belonging, and the world is designed to be a shared experience. Players can visit each other’s homes, help with crafting or farming, and participate in large-scale events.\n\nThere’s also an emphasis on NPC interactions, with a rich cast of characters to befriend. The dialogue and relationship-building mechanics are engaging, and the NPCs have distinct personalities that make interactions feel meaningful. Romanceable NPCs add a layer of depth, though the relationship system is still somewhat basic in its current form.\n\nRoom for Improvement: Despite its charm, Palia isn’t without its flaws. The game could benefit from more content diversity. After mastering the available skills, there’s a lack of end-game content, which could make long-term play feel stagnant. Adding new activities, quests, and crafting options would help sustain interest over time.\n\nAdditionally, while the game runs smoothly for the most part, there are occasional bugs and glitches, such as resource spawn issues or server hiccups, which can disrupt gameplay. The developers have been responsive to feedback, so future updates may address these concerns.\n\nConclusion: Palia is a refreshing, tranquil take on the MMO genre, providing a peaceful, non-combat experience that’s perfect for players seeking a slower-paced, community-driven game. Its cozy aesthetic, focus on social interaction, and simple yet engaging gameplay mechanics make it a joy to play, especially for fans of life simulation games. While it lacks some depth in terms of end-game content, and there’s room for expansion, Palia is a promising and delightful entry into the genre.\n\nIf you're looking for an MMO that’s more about building friendships and relaxing than grinding levels or fighting bosses, Palia is worth checking out.",

I wouldn't mind spending like 5eur on a skin, but 40 eur for one outfit or 10 eur for a pet is absolutely insane. Blocking players from earning anything themselves in terms of cosmetics is a major major downside and really greedy. Animal crossing does this in a much better way. \n\nI would much rather spend 40 euros once to buy the game than spend thousands just trying to buy the cosmetics. That's some EA garbage right there. And its sad because you can see the writers and artists and devs did put a lot of effort into making a cute game.\n\nThe multiplayer part also feels very half-a$sed. Yes, theres a chat and you see players running around. You can group up with a friend and see their location. But that's about it. No quest sync, no trading with friends, no mailing friends items, no dungeons or group content, you can't see each other when you're in a temple,  you can't even plant seeds for a friend. what is the point? It seems like the MMO part is just a marketing buzzword. It's about as multiplayer as elden ring is.",

How is one supposed to have a wholesome farm experience without any horses? \n\n2. The cooking mini game is the most boring and unsatisfying one i've seen in a game. I wish they'd take notes from Immortal Life, or Kynseed.\n\n3. The quests are few and far between. The world isn't living with no quests.\n\n4. The devs get no profit from designing interesting quests, or writing deep characters. All their profit comes from selling cosmetics on their immersion-breaking store for a lot of money. \n\nUnless they add some subscription option, I don't expect any quality content to be created. \n\nMore on that:\nThis game was marketed as wholesome and cozy, with healthy practices. The devs seemed like there was actually some love in the project, and were interested in making a good game for a wholesome, cozy experience. \n\nThe first red flag was the \"free to play\". No option was even offered to players to buy the game at a fair price, and/or opt to pay for a subscription and then enjoy a complete, immersive world without FOMO, tricks, predatory and stressful microtransactions, and the constant reminder of greed breathing down your neck.\n\nThe game doesn't feel wholesome. It feels superficial, and put together for the sole purpose of greed. The microtransactions are integrated in the game, in a way that kills any immersion or wholesomeness one could hope to find in a fantasy world. \n\nI haven't followed the whole drama, but i did see the trailers and marketing prior to releasing the beta, and trying out the game a year later, it was difficult to imagine that the game in that was marketed was this game i was experiencing. From what I read other people saying online, there's been a lot of drama during that year i missed. Many people blame Palia's devs for lies, unmet promises and a clear indication that this is not the wholesome feel-good game it was marketed to be, just another greedy game with no love in the making whatsoever. \n\nI guess we'll have to wait a little longer for the real deal. Too bad.",

It definitely still has stuff to improve and bugs to be fixed, but the game play style alongside an engaging story that gives you the freedom to progress at your own pace and the social/collaborative nature of the game with fellow members of the server makes those \"negatives\" almost insignificant.\r\n\r\n If I had to ask for something it would be to give us creative freedom in certain aspects of decoration positioning which might sound like asking too much given the magnitude of improvements that can already be done to our plot. However sometimes the limitations on where an object can be placed or not inside the grid, or the lack of angles, or objects not interacting well with the surroundings do cut us short from the cozy building experience.  It would also be great if we could move the mail box and selling container to anywhere in the plot as it is a bit annoying not been able to change the way the entrance looks.\r\n\r\nWhen playing in a party with a friend, it is often that we lose sight of each other and our friend's character seems to disappear as we run around. The same way our character disappears from our friend's perspective and can result to be confusing as we try to follow each other. There is a serious need of a mini map as well! Having to rely on clicking M to open the big map limits our ability to keep moving as we locate a place. \r\n\r\nOverall the game is super fun whether you have friends to play with or not. The online open multiplayer server allows you to chat with others, ask for help, request needed items for quests or personal use, create a community and make new friends as you discover all the secrets hiding in Palia! Don't let the need for minor fixes in a game that is still in development discourage you from having a wonderful time! The game is totally worth the hype!",

In fact the writing for some of the NPC stories is absolutely brilliant, as is the animation for certain characters and their body language (all of the NPCs feel well written and well fleshed out, they all have motivations and solid backstories, it's really good in most cases).\r\n\r\nThere is a certain level of grinding (chop trees, mine rocks, grow crops) but it's on the level of Stardew and it's easy to know what to do. The in-game community is generally friendly and will help out with problems, questions, fetch-quests and so on. A few quests are not very clear about what you need to do at certain points, but again the community will help if they can, and there's a good wiki online with pointers.\r\n\r\nIt needs some polishing, but there's content updates ongoing and it feels like a game that should be brilliant by the time it hits full release.",

This is one of the most co-operative games I've ever played with quests, gathering, and cooking encouraging you to play with others to enjoy bonuses for everyone.

There are a lot of great new changes mostly revolving around the game being more friendly to get rare resources. \n\nThere is loads of things to do and to grind for, with a huge focus on community and player friendship. Over the year there still aren't many \"new\" things to do or new zones which does mean that the game gets stale still a year later after playing it for a week or so in a row.\n\nOne thing that's a really big negative that almost made me change my review is that there are a lot of community rules that aren't stated anywhere other than in the brains of the people who follow them and/or have played long enough to know them, Not knowing these rules such as Cutting flow tree groves at 3am in game time caused a large argument on the server today with me cutting too early, I did not know and wasn't told but broke some scared rule that caused a player to hurl abuse at me over chat for 20 mins. \n\nIf the community is going to create rules that are expected to be followed the developers should perhaps put these into the in game loading screens or tool-tips once they become expected. \n\nI've had these negative experiences with more players then I'd expect to for a game that at it's core is a \"Cozy MMO\".\n\nOther then this the game is really nice and the community as a whole has be wonderful.",

Everything from the world to the characters, graphics and story is so well done. Gameplay provides plenty of variety. You can collect insects, do combat, or focus on gathering and building if you so please, something that I've wished more games like this would offer. You can even build friendships and romance the other characters. This game truly has it all. Not a huge fan of having to pay for cosmetics and skins rather than earning them though. The one major gripe that I have with the game however, is the fact that it's online only. As others have said, this game really doesn't feel like it should be a multiplayer game. The servers don't seem to be too populated and the socialization between other players is nearly nonexistent aside from a few people sharing tips here and there. I think it would've been a better idea to make the game singeplayer and give those who wish to play with others the ability to create a server that others can join, similar to Palworld and Genshin, that way players don't have to rely on being connected to wifi to be able to play. The game truly doesn't need to be multiplayer in my opinion. Aside from that though, it would also be nice to have the ability to sit in chairs and benches as others have said.",

With its amazing variety of things to do and the decidedly less violent take on social gaming it caters to those more inclined to less violence and/or women like me that couldn't care less about all the rampant PvP out there in gaming today.

Reading Discord and other Forums, it seems they are slow to add any real expansion and have only added visual content since the Beta Release. The Update today even speaks of \"bringing back\", instead of \"look at all the new content\".\r\n\r\nThere are things you will wish you knew before you spend any Real World Cash, like buying the Plot Backgrounds, because you only get 2 free Plots, and it is the most expensive thing in game to have to purchase. I spent $80 in RWC, to find out that I still will have to work, virtually forever, to get the in-game Coin to purchase the additional Plots to show off my $80 investment in the game.\r\n\r\nI do not like that it is similar to a Browser Game, in that every time you purchase a Plot Item, the price goes up, SIGNIFICANTLY. You get NOTHING better, bigger or new, in fact, you only have 2 Main House Options even available, right now. Browser Games sell In-Game Coin for Real World Cash, but you cannot purchase Coin in this game.\r\n\r\nI am holding out hope that it grows and expands in the very near future, but I am still having fun, and there are some neat ways to decorate that are keeping me busy, for now.",

Players call out and mark rare spawns of ore, trees, plants and critters and wait for others to arrive. There's a gifting system where players help each other out with items they have had in the past but need now.  You can decorate your home plot with thousands of items from drops to different buildings and recently added building blocks. I've seen fortresses, castles and custom homes.

It's so good and I'm happy to buy the cosmetics just to support the devs! Hours and hours of fun and wonderful people to play with, it's perfect. \n\nMy biggest complaint is the storage space. 8 chests, even upgraded, is nowhere near enough when you get to late game. I greatly appreciate stuff like furniture not taking up space, but that is kind of expected since you can't sell it, which also sucks.\n\nAnd the other main complaint is that the controller support, while functioning and decent, it's still not great yet. Many features still require you to use your keyboard and sometimes the controller functions stop working for 1 button, like jumping or sprinting which can be frustrating if you are trying to do a jumping puzzle. \n\nAlso the last tiny complaint is that trying to set up the kitchen stuff is a nightmare. It will tell you that you don't have a stove when you have 2. What it means is you don't have a stove that you havn't unlocked yet. It took me so long to figure this out for petit fives that it means the NEXT step up from a stove that you initially start with. It was hours of headache and just sucked.\n\nOtherwise I really do enjoy playing Palia, I just hope with further work and additions that the storage, kitchen and controller's features will improve.",

      "https://steam/76561198118238232": "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-19)](https://steam/76561198118238232)\nI've been playing Palia for a few months now, and I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical at first, being an MMO, which I had deliberately stayed away from for years. However, this is unlike any MMO I've ever played before. There is no combat, no enemies, and group play is highly encouraged. There is also no player economy, only that between you and the NPCs. \n\nMain Goals: Building your dream home in your own housing plot is the ultimate goal. And this is actually where the game starts you off. The quests are definitely worth doing for both the story line and the rewards. They opens up parts of the game you wouldn't be able to access otherwise, and many of the rewards include decor items absolutely worth having. Building friendships with the NPCs is equally important, and very similar to Stardew Valley, Garden  Paws, and the My Time at Portia game series, among others, I'm sure. The rewards for these in Palia, though, feel much more rewarding. \n\nGroup play: playing in parties has its perks; everyone gets the same loot as long as you're within a certain range of one another. However, it's not completely necessary. If you and another player hit the same rock, node, tree, game animal, etc., at the same time, you both contribute to \"tagging\" it, and you both get loot. Fishing has a bonus, too, when fishing near other players.\n\nGifting: Another aspect of group play, in regards to player economy is the gifting system. There's no trading, such as between players directly or in a party, (though this has been heavily requested), but you can request items through the social tab and another player can gift it to you that way. And to help mitigate abuse of this system, there is a daily cap on how many times you can request items.\n\nThe Material Grind: This is similar to other games in that you still have to do it almost constantly, and the rarer materials, such as Palium ore, and other foraging items, make it that much more of a grind. However, group play, in parties, or just running round with other players, and call-outs to these rare locations in chat help to make this easier. There are only two main map areas at this time, as well, and certain materials are restricted to each location respectively. There is also fishing and bug catching, and both have nice perks, which I won't spoil here.\n\nFood and Crops: You have your crops you grow in your housing plot, both for selling and for making food. The food provides what the game calls \"focus\" which gives you a boost to XP while in the world farming materials and while crafting. Food and focus are both important. \n\nMaking Money: Fish, bugs, and extra crops will be your primary money makers in the beginning. Extra crafting materials are also good money makers in later game. Crafted decor items cannot be sold, but they also do not take up inventory space in your chests. \n\nCommunities: This is Palia's equivalent of Guilds. However, it's still a work in progress. There's not much to do in Communities yet, but I hear that it's getting a face-lift, so I'm excited to see what's coming for communities. Hopefully this also includes a Community Plot and daily goals. \n\nOverall I absolutely recommend this game, whether you're a seasoned MMO player, or new to MMOs, or just looking for casual group or individual play. Since there's no combat system and everyone shares materials in the world, this eliminates most of the game stress you get from more competitive MMOs. And if you do feel stressed, or need time alone, you can simply spend hours in your housing plot building your very own palace!",

However, doing so would be setting others up for disappointment.\n\nThis game has the potential to be one of the most comfortable and relaxing MMOs to have ever been made. I truly mean that. But in order to do that it would need to be developed by an entirely new team/company, probably. \n\nThe issues:\n1. The game is so filled to the brim with glitches and game-breaking bugs that they NEVER should have even considered it past alpha. The ground will vanish. The menus will bug out. The NPCs are almost nonfunctional. The quests will bug out. The list is actually so long I won't bother. Just know that the game BARELY functions. \n\n2. The optimization of the game is ATROCIOUS. You can run all the way to the center of the (only) town in the game and the buildings will STILL be popping into existence one wall at a time with 20 second intervals between them. The town is TINY! How?! It's truly horrid.\n\n3. This is the one that pisses me off. The thing that makes me unwilling to be patient with this anymore is that they continue to push out CONSTANT updates. \"For what?\" you may ask. \n\n[h1] IN-GAME PURCHASES and MICROTRANSACTIONS BAAAABBYYYYY [/h1] \n\nIt's the ONLY THING they care AT ALL about. They make it more and more clear as they keep releasing more real-money skins into the game. (Funny too because even these are bugged as hell. They glitch into themselves and look just truly terrible.)\n\nMy wife and I have played a lot of this game. (Mostly on Switch...which...lol don't bother...) We really were loving the comfortable relax vibes as we tried to wind down at the end of the evening. But the game has become steadily more unplayable and just filled to the brim with microtransactions. \n\nWant this game to succeed? Fire the team making these decisions and get better programmers. Until then this looks like a cash grab of the laziest nature. \n\nEdit just to add: If you try to bring up any of your concerns with this game to it's community you will be shouted down and removed from any of their communities you bring it up in. It doesn't matter how civil you try to be about it when expressing genuine concerns. For such a cozy game and a (normally) super positive community they DO NOT like when you ask questions like 'Why are the buildings not loading in anymore?\" I don't understand the zealous nature of the defense of this particular game by its players but it's kind of weird.",

Do you like Animal Crossing and wish to have more freedom with how you place your decor? Do you enjoy farm sim games like Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley, or Fields of Mistria and wish it were a 3D title instead?\r\n\r\nThen allow me to introduce you to Palia!\r\n\r\nCurrently in Beta and free to play with cosmetic options for those who like some icing on the cake, Palia is perfect for anyone who wants a casual farm sim/adventuring MMO with low stakes and a lot of heart. It's very forgiving in terms of game play, where even in situations where you can die, death is not a huge setback. This is a boon to those who aren't talented in platforming, which is an aspect of the game critical to advancing the main story quest line.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of this game I specifically enjoy are the characters. They're beautifully rendered, and every single npc has something going on. From the hard-on-their-luck farming family, to the mayor's dysfunctional home, the variety and intricacies of the social circles in Palia fascinate me. As someone who yearns for variety in character design, this game is a breath of fresh air. I only wish the dating pool in Palia were a bit broader!\r\n\r\nAs this game is still in beta, there are some areas of the game that could use improvement. As previously mentioned, I would enjoy seeing more bachelors and bachelorettes added to the roster. Sifuu, Ashura, and Zeki come to mind. Yes, even though some people might find them abrasive. Okay, this includes Eloise and Caleri too. Could be fun romance paths, after all.\r\nAnother aspect I have found a little frustrating is that sometimes, quests aren't clear about the next step to take. I understand this can be used to encourage exploring. When it works, quests feel like they have a snowballing effect that's naturally rewarding. Being stymied because an objective was just a little too obtuse (and don't get me wrong, I'm a veteran of point and click adventure games so obtuse solutions aren't a deal breaker for me) can be a turn off. Hopefully the devs smooth this part out a bit. I can see it negatively impacting gameplay for some folks.\r\n\r\nLet's wrap this up with talking about the building aspect. Progression through crafting trees are fairly straightforward: gather materials, craft, invent (or buy) new recipes, and repeat. Progress rarely feels like a grind. Although there are some aspects that make a player slow down, such as when items are in a smelter or other materials processing, I find it balances out so you're freed up to go out into the world again.\r\n\r\nTL:DR; Great casual social game for folks who like farm sims with a little bit of intrigue. I think I'll be playing this one for hundreds of hours into the future.",
      "https://steam/76561198797595311": "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-16)](https://steam/76561198797595311)\nFun and exciting game play and story line. Some glitches but that's to be expected with beta testing. Some things that I wish could be added were 1. more facial feature characterization options. Right now the facial features are limited into the selection of head shape (choosing a head shape comes with eyes, nose and lips already pre-selected with that particular head shape). It would be nice to be able to choose your own eyebrow shape, eye shape, lip shape, etc. 2. Another thing that was hard for me to adjust to was trying to find people for quests. It might be nice to add a hint of when said person would out in the time of day or where to look for them. Granted most people you talk to who send you to go look for someone will tell you, but I can't tell you how many times I went looking for Hodori not being able to find him on the map. Which leads me to my next suggestion. 3. It would be nice to have a visual in-game other than the compass above the screen. Like a trail of mystical glitter to follow when you set a way-point. These are honestly my only pet peeves and they are small but the way-point one was very frustrating for me. I have ADHD and Autism so my brain gets easily distracted but wants to find the fastest route which sometimes makes it take longer to find someone--and the more I mess up the more overstimulated I become because I can't find what I'm looking for. It just makes for a not fun internal situation I have to handle over something someone who doesn't struggle with what I do might not. Definitely a fun game that I look forward to seeing the further development of and see how things unfold.",

I like to think of it as a cross between games like Harvest Moon, Story of Seasons, Stardew Valley, and Animal Crossing. There's plenty of skills to learn and master, tools to upgrade, and achievements to be had. Partying up is the best way to play this game not only because it's fun, but with more people, you reap more rewards. It's free to play too with the optional cosmetic purchases for your character and your plot, so if you're interested, definitely give it a whirl. You might find that you very much enjoy it.",

My first ever, 'cozy', type of game, so mostly just building up life skills and running quests. \n\nLeveling up your skills of course gets tougher the more you level up, so there is quite a bit of grind, especially if you add in grinding for money. \n\nThe climbing system can be a bit glitchy and can be frustrating when trying to climb something but your character pulls out their glider instead. \n\nCommunity seems friendly and I appreciate the etiquette when it comes to chopping down flow trees and/or palium. The server always seems to be active, so you never really feel like you're playing alone (which is something I liked about Once Human, but that game appears to have died).\n\nNot bad for a free game. Apparently the last big update had more to do with adding more cash shop items than it did actually fixing bugs and improving QOL issues, so take it for what its worth. At the end of the day, the only color that makes the world spin is green!",

The game gives me Animal Crossing NH vibes in the similar ways that I catch bugs, fish, garden, gather rss, decorate and even build relationships with the npcs. I have completed the story up to where it currently is and though I know a lot of people want more, as do I, I understand the game is still very early on in its development with a fairly small team. The devs are pretty transparent with what's going on at any given time (they are pretty active on their discord). Between twitch drops and event gifts from the studio there has been a fair amount of additional items given to players that I think are a nice touch. Though there are glitches and bugs that happen with every patch, updates are fairly regular imo with one pretty much monthly that adds a decent amount of features plus fixes to the game. Considering it's a free game it is hard to argue that it's not worth it, even if you only play until the current content runs out, I think the overall design of the game and gameplay will draw back existing players as the game expands (elderwoods etc). It has been fun to meet some cool people through the game too since it is so socially driven. I also enjoy streaming it and watching other streamers play it, I think there is a lot of potential for big group events within communities who play together (though party limit is currently 4).",

If it wasn't for looking up wiki's I wouldn't have gotten as far as I have so far. I'm still missing more of the fish. Feels bad man.",

I feel so relaxed whether I am completing quests or taking care of my plot.\r\n\r\nWith the game being free to play it only makes sense you would have in-app transactions on custom skins. That's where things get expensive - I can't justify spending $40 for two skins, but that's just me.

However, here's my problems with it:\n\n- To actually login to make a Palia account (if u decide to), you need to change a few keys. Even when using a PC layout it didn't recognise the mouse or keyboard. If you're on steam deck, it is playable but the controls are weird af.\n\n- Character customisation is buggy, constantly changing for example a characters shirt even though u didn't click anything. This made the process longer.\n\n- Game play at first was attractive, but past that first stage, its rather boring. There's nothing attractive other than it being apparently a cozy game.

You can talk to villagers, fulfill quests and become friends. There is a main story, but there is no urgency to it. Basically, you can just collect resources and build a nice little home. The map is big enough to allow some exploring, yet small enough to constantly see other players. I think that the co-op aspect could still be fleshed out a little.

The unstuck function did nothing, neither did restarting the game. Luckily, the map has a teleporting function that I could use to return home and, next time I wandered into town, everything had loaded correctly and no issues happened. I continued to play around and have fun until about  a couple hours later, when it happened again. This time, my teleport button was on cooldown (what the heck!?) and I had to stop playing because I couldn't get out from under the house.\r\n\r\nI was incredibly pissed and considering stopping for good, but this was proof that the game already had its claws on me. I was enjoying interacting with the towns-folk, all pretty stereotypical on the surface but with hidden depths which are revealed organically through talking to them and finishing missions. The many systems of the game are engrossing and interesting: fishing is not limited to pushing a button when the fish bites, cooking is not limited to adding the correct ingredients. The sense of progression feels very real, both by missions slowly unlocking one another and new systems and gadgets becoming available, and made me want to keep playing to see what unlocks next. I have a couple of minor gripes, but they're far, far outweighed by the amount of Good Brain Juice™ I get from playing.\r\n\r\nThe MMO aspect feels a bit undercooked, but it definitely fosters a friendly environment for interactions, and I think that's the most important part of it. \r\n\r\nOverall, I'll keep playing Palia as much as I can, until I inevitably fall through the ground into a limbo from which there's no escape.",

MOBILE GAMES.\n\nI personally Invested over $100 into this games cosmetics, and theres been no actual fixes to the game/netcode that actually matter. (THIS GAME IS VERY EASY TO EXPLOIT)\n\nTheir Social tab is a joke, it never saves parties (friend requests are always broken), chat is always down etc.\nTheir company seems to only put effort into their Assets, and NOT into the actual game servers. (which, has NO CLOUDFLARE protection btw, so their servers could be DDosed VERY easily.\n\nI love the feel of the game regardless of the bugs, but since I learned about \"Disney Dreamlight Valley\" being released first, I wont be playing this anymore or supporting the devs.\nThey keep teasing a new area, but theres no leaks, or even teaser images.

It's pretty alright.\r\nBut honestly, that's about the extent I can talk about this game.\r\nBecause outside of a few small niche things (Bug catching is like throwing Pokeballs) it really doesn't do much that you can't get from other farming village games.

Means that your progression is stretched out over very little content, and when you try to engage with the content, you find out pretty quickly there's little to none of it.\r\n\r\nI stopped playing for something like a year a while back, and came back recently to see what was new, and honestly?

Too peaceful. too quiet, too slow. Yet Palia somehow combined everything that I love almost on instinct level from other games and just smashed a \"farm sim\" sticker on it. \r\n- Platforming and adventure-ish gameplay approach like in Zelda? Check. \r\n- Smooth controls, interface and social aspect remotely reminding my beloved World of Warcraft? Check.\r\n- Building system so perfect, that it looks like if Todd would give the dev team of Fallout 4 more than half-a-day to develop it? Check.\r\n- Basically, everything you need from a canonical farming/life simulator aka Stardew Valley? CHECK.\r\n\r\nThis game certainly has some grinding implemented in it, yet considering how well the world, sound and the whole vibe of this game are designed, it doesn't matter at all. You can just go with the flow, carelessly run around and do random stuff while enjoying the calming music and peaceful views and in no time you, apparently, have collected half the stuff you needed for another bundle. \r\n\r\nSurely, a decent amount of work is seen in how light and welcoming the in-game world feels. The main storyline is finely implemented in this world, it develops in front of the player with good pace and it has some sort of a mystery in it, that makes me want to find out more. But the characters are not that interesting (except for a mere couple) and they seem more generic, than writers probably wanted them to be. \r\n\r\nOverall, I am very glad that I have stumbled upon this game so randomly, and it brings me nothing but relaxation and joy so far.

It's an MMORPG with a cozy atmosphere to it. Emphasis on cozy.\r\n\r\nPROS:\r\n\r\n1) The art style is pretty. I see elements of Genshin Impact and Breath of the Wild here, but Singularity 6 makes their own artistic mark, too. It's really quite attractive. I like the little details, like that you can see the breeze blowing.\r\n2) The characters are memorable individuals with their own personalities and stories. You can even romance some of them, like Tish, the carpenter cutie.\r\n3) You can build your own homestead/dream house, and deck it out in decorations of all kinds. Want a farmhouse? A cottagecore cottage? A witchy abode? Something with fashionable chic? You can probably build it.\r\n4) There's 8 different professions you learn along the way. While some may be familiar, such as mining, some also seem unique to this game (or at least unique to a small handful of games), such as bug catching and furniture making.\r\n5) The world is interesting and beautiful. It's small, because they just released it into beta like a year ago, but it already has a thriving community. There's a bunch of how-tos on YouTube, 3 or 4 wikis, and some interactive maps online. There's currently only two adventuring zones, Kilima Valley and Bahari Bay, but Singularity 6 is working on their third: The Elderwood. Despite its small size, there's plenty to do. Decorating your homestead will keep you busy for a while just by itself.\r\n6) At least for right now, while it's in beta, Palia is free to play. No subscriptions, no season or battle passes, none of that nonsense. Just download, make a character, and get lost in this world.\r\n7) It's RELAXING. You can't die. There is no fall damage. You don't pass out like in Stardew. In fact, the late hours give you access to special materials, like magical flow wood. It's not violent, either. The hunting, for example, drops a loot bag. No skinning, or bones, or anything gross. I'm not sure if Sing-6 is going to change it (I hope not), but you can go anywhere without fear of aggroing a monster that lays you flat. It's truly relaxing.\r\n\r\nCONS:\r\n\r\n1) I'm having an issue with storage. You can get up to 5 bars in your backpack, but you run out of space quick. You start with 3, I believe, the 4th one is 5K gold, and the 5th is a whopping 25K gold (I'm having some trouble building up that amount. You know how you can make and utilize as many storage chests as you want in Minecraft? Not in Palia. You can only set down eight, and they fill up rapidly. Hoarding stuff for cooking or furniture making is difficult, because it all takes up precious space. I'm hoping they fix this soon. I'd like to build a storage warehouse on my land.\r\n2) There's some place you can get stuck, which has happened to me a few times. They have a button on the main menu for a stuck character, so that's good. But, it's still annoying. I've also seen other players sink into the ground a little. Occasionally, an NPC appears to have a pathing problem, where their walking becomes stuttered or they scooch along the ground without moving. Again, beta.\r\n3) They have a lot of interesting outfits and stuff in the game store. As far as I can tell, none of it is game-changing, so no pay-to-win. It's all just cosmetic. However, more than a few people have mentioned it being a little spendy, so you have to decide whether it's worth it if you're thinking of buying something. I think it's how they make their revenue, because the game is free to play right now. I'm not sure how else they make money.\r\n4) The progression feels a little slow, but since the world is still small, the rate of progression might be a good thing right now. After profession level 5, hunting, fishing, foraging, mining, and bug-catching seem to slow down a lot. A little patience is necessary, but the pace isn't insurmountable. They may tweek it a bit when the world gets bigger, and they finish with beta testing.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I love this game. I've only been playing for maybe 3 weeks, and I immediately fell in love with it. It's cozy enough to be called a cozy game, but there are some challenging aspects to it.

Even then, there's still plenty to do. The only thing you need to pay for is cosmetic items, which honestly is understandable since the game is free.

Word of warning, if you like fast paced combat, non-stop action, and strategy this is not the game for you. If you however like peaceful venues, meditative music, great roleplay, and having fun with your friends this game has it all. You can build your own houses, you can have a bit of romance if you want, you can explore the entire map freely, and build all the furniture there is in the game and decorations. There are rewards for completing tasks and leveling sills, and trophies for hitting milestones. This is a lot of content considering that this game is still in beta. This game developer is clearly in it for the right reason, they clearly know what their audience wants, and they are promising more content to come... in fact their most recent patch added MORE furniture you can craft and collect. Despite not having any fast paced action I have already spent 172 hours in this game at the time of writing this review. This game makes it clear that you don't need fast paced action or strategy to enjoy a game, this is by now means a game like SWTOR, Skyrim, ESO, and The Fallout Series, and I am quite fine with that. Palia is not for fans of those franchises, and to be fair I have encountered very few bugs when compared to those games. The developers don't force you to spend money on unnecessary things to enjoy the great majority of the game, but they have this option. Most if not all of the things in this game can be crafted or bought with in game currency that you gain through in game means. WIll they at one point charge for this game? maybe but that day has not come. My belief is that they are doing fine at the moment with the players they have and with selling in game items and have no need for it at the moment. I do not foresee that this will change anytime soon but i would not mind it if it did change, because this game in every sense of the word is a paradise. It is calming and exciting, and makes me content. It is a game that is easy to play and because of it's nature there is no possibility of griefing like other games; this fosters a helpful and kind community. In conclusion is implore you, give this game a chance. You will not be sorry.",

The downside for me is that it is a little bit glitchy at times, the party system only works half of the time, and i ruined a star quality dish because it froze the cooking animation ;-; (its hidden in my house now ^^)\r\n\r\nOverall, solid 10/10 for me.

For instance, climbing isn't perfect. Sometimes when you glide to a wall you grip it and then fall down it a little before you start climbing. I'm not hugely fond of the trade system in the game. I understand the reason they had it set up the way they do. They are trying to prevent people from getting things they haven't gotten themselves from other players. It just makes it a little frustrating when you spend a few hours trying to catch a fish and never see it, but your friend has one they don't need. \r\n\r\nThat being said, this game has given me hours of fun fishing, mining, foraging, cooking, gardening, decorating, befriending the villagers, etc. There is so much to do, a bunch of little puzzles in the world, and over all the game play is fun. As a free to play game, I was willing to spend some money on cosmetics because I got enough enjoyment out of the game to spend it.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot to love here in a cozy game. The cooking is a lot of fun. You can cook with your friends, and each person who helped gets a stack for themselves. The fishing is relaxing, the mining/logging/foraging is straight forward and satisfying, the bug catching is fun and a nice edition to the game, and by far the best part of it all is meeting all of the villagers and building your relationship with the town. Finding out their likes and dislikes, and seeing their reaction when you gift them what they want for the week. \r\n\r\nI would say despite some of the little bugs here and there, the game itself is well worth playing.",

I only have one true issue with this game and its that fact that there just is not enough storage space, like why cap us at 8 chests?

The housing customization has a good amount of freedom to it and the professions are both intertwined and can give you something to place in your house/s (for the most part, not sure if you can craft food that can be placed). The community also seems to be nice. I saw people calling for other players in chat when they see a rare resource so that others can go there and take it as well, which left an impression on me. And there\\s a gifting system where you can request for an item and others can give it to you which also encourages cooperation.\r\nGranted there are some mobile game-esque mechanics like waiting more than 10 minutes for a resource to be prepared, but you can't rush it with premium currency so I feel it's there mostly to put an emphasis on slow play, which is a good mentality to have with such games.\r\nThe game is free to play with the option to buy cosmetics so there's little reason to not try it out if one's interested.",

The NPCs are charming (many of them quite cheesy, in the absolute best way) and the design of both the village and the landscapes are as well, and the critters are varied enough to stay interesting as you explore. The quests are sometimes tricky to figure out what or where you're supposed to do and go, but the puzzles themselves are tricky enough to be pleasant without being frustrating in their difficulty or complexity. Everything seems well-paced, quests and skill-progression and character relationships. \r\n\r\nAll in all it's a wonderful experience, and the fact that the predominant attitude of the other folks playing online seem so far to be amiable has been a refreshing relief, as is the fact that the world rarely seems so crowded with other players as to overwhelm any given area.

I've been going through a rough time and my brother recommended this game as a casual and laid back experience. There's no combat, rather there are 8 skills that you can level up by using those skills. There is an adventure aspect to it, even a few \"dungeons\" which are puzzle-based, like a lighter version of a Legend of Zelda puzzle. The game does get grindy, where you need to keep fishing or catching bugs over and over, and there are a few improvements that could be made, I.E. giving residents gifts from your storage would be nice, instead of having to run back to my home, check who wants what, and pull it all out of the chests. There is a crafting aspect to the game for tool upgrades, smelting and building a home, but even that gets difficult to keep up with as things become pretty expensive pretty quickly.

The developers of this game should be embarrassed at the lack of professionalism within it. The real money store is a predatory ploy for young players. The waiting periods for crafting are absurdly long and make the game feel like a mobile game. The additions to this game are extremely slow to arrive and often do not arrive on the expected date. There are frequent keybinding and clicking bugs that must be solved by players. The list goes on. I keep coming back to this game waiting for it to be something that it isn't; good.

I am writing this review with only about 4-5 days of me playing this game. You be the judge if I like this game or not.\n\nFor being a Beta game it surely has a lot and is fun. Already got me spending money to buy some clothes. But overall this game is very fun. Similar to Stardew Valley but it's coop and has of course it's own features to it. There's a learning curve to this game and it gives you a vague description or tutorial on how to do things, so I get why it's overwhelming to many. Google will be your best friend with this game. The community is VERY FRIENDLY. Everyone is so nice. There's some unspoken Palia Ethics already which I love. \n\nOverall, just needs some more tutorials for beginners and some items. I do hope they publish a \"Trade with Other Player\" feature and some Farm Animals and possibly a Mount you can ride, since it's a bit difficulty to get to one place to another.",
      "https://steam/76561198124741888": "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-28)](https://steam/76561198124741888)\nFor a free game that's in beta still, you can see by the play hours of the positive reviews this game already offers a lot, and I had a really good time with it!\n\nHere I'll go through what I was looking for before playing, the pros and cons and then offer some tips at the bottom. \n\nBasically:\n+ lovely peaceful game\n+ lots to do\n+ not greedy devs, cosmetics only\n- very buggy\n- story and design still in beta\n\nHow free is it? \nIt's just cosmetics; there's no way to pay to be better or faster. When you log in the first time, there's a message from Singularity 6 which basically says \"if you like our game please tell people about it\" which I thought was really nice, I never felt pressured to spend, I bought a couple of cosmetics to support them for giving me 100 hours of enjoyment.\n\nWhat is the gameplay?\n\nVery casual and easy-going, it's based around building your home and the core skills which you level up; bug catching, cooking, fishing, foraging, furniture crafting, gardening, hunting and mining. As you level up you unlock more things you can craft for each skill and these skills are how you interact with the story, complete objectives and challenges.\n\nThe villagers work the same way; you level up your relationship with them to unlock cool things and more quests, they also provide the structure; context to the quests and objectives you'll be completing. A small part of this is the main story line, which is pretty interesting so far, but I'd say like 10% complete at the moment. There are other stories of different villagers which are complete to varying degrees, since the game is in beta. I'll say the few cutscenes that are finished are really nice.\n\nThis happens across two maps Kilima (medium sized) and Bahari (large sized), and there's a lot of running around, but there's no fall damage and nothing can hurt you. There is fast travel, but the game does not point it out (I'll get to that). \n\nEverything important to the game tends to work well and is fun! It didn't lag at all or crash hardly at all. I was able to do most of everything required in the game without big issues.\n\nNow, there are some negatives to consider; being a beta this game has many, many smaller bugs!\n\nIn my time almost everything you can think of had some sort of glitch (maps, menus, chat, gameplay, etc); there's a lot so here are some examples of the prominent common issues I had, as experienced played with a controller:\n\n1. Menus can be jank, it gets stuck and you have to switch to the next tab and then back to fix it. Sometimes also you press a button to do one thing and it does something else which uses the same button. \n\n2. The map can be jank, you select one villager to track and it keeps selecting somebody else far away.\n\n3. Also, from the map you can press a button to teleport home; this button is the same as the run button, but sometimes after closing the map menu, the game thinks it's open when it's not, so when you return to game and go to run you teleport home when you don't want to; since the areas are large and you have to wait before you can use the home teleport again, this bug was by far the most annoying!\n\n4. You have a wheel to select the tool you want, sometimes it selects the same tool over and over again and you miss out on a rare insect or hunting opportunity because you can't put your fishing rod away in time.\n\n5. Visually, EVERYBODY, every NPC and player, bug out; they're gliding across the floor, standing in the ground, floating above the ground, walking in place, walking through walls, appearing to fall, some players even get stuck under the inn. You can buy a cosmetic pet that runs around with you, but I couldn't use it because it was constantly bugging out and distracting me; dropping from the sky in front of me or flipping out, and other player's physics items are always stretching and glitching out. Mostly this happens when you first get there and from a distance, but not always. It did not affect the gameplay but it's absolutely something you'll notice, even if you do get used to it quickly.\n\n6. A few NPC positions can make it hard to interact with them or around them, like Hassian stands on the same exact spot as his dog Tau, and Shiffa blocks access to her own anvil, so you have to jump around to find the specific spot needed.\n\n7. I had a constant bug where my character would keep turning 180 degrees when still to face the camera; I HATE this bug, especially when you're around other players, lol.\n\nThere are design issues too: \n\n1. Lack of tutorials for important or basic things, or tutorials appearing far after you need them when you're first starting. I had to look up basic things on my phone because simple, obvious things like dragging and dropping would not work.\n\n2. You can't sell furniture you make, even for the price of the materials or for 1 gold just to get rid of them; you have to store or destroy furniture.\n\n3. NPCs sometimes ask for outrageously rare items for little to no reason.\n\n4. If you don't enjoy one of the skills it can take a long time to reach the level up needed (like I don't enjoy cooking). A few quests require items only obtainable by progressing far in one of these skills, but there should always be another way to get these items, even if it's tricky, otherwise you're forcing players to grind something they don't enjoy. This was rare but still an issue.\n\n5. Lastly, I'd say some of the quests require a lot of work and have a little or no pay off (Jina's picnic, Tish's dance) I again assume due to being beta. Some quests are very anticlimactic and end with no real consequence.\n\nOverall:\n\nEven despite all of that jank I had a great time with this game. This main gameplay of using your skills to help NPCs and unlock things as you play was peaceful and mostly fun and rewarding, you can decorate your property quite impressively, and throughout the game it's fun discovering what you can unlock you had no idea about. \n\nThere's a review saying this game is not for introverts but I really have to disagree, I think there's one quest that might need interaction (fulfil a player request). If you do want to talk the game is basically full of people who just want to chill and build a cool little house, so I found people really chill and helpful anyway. Totally recommend!\n\nTips!\n\n1. Know what you have! \n\nThere's a lot of rare and epic items in the game, some which can take days to find if you're looking for them, which you might find by chance, so if you're just starting and you get an epic bug or fish that you don't know what to do with, keep it! (as you might want it later for something to do with a door and night sky temple) and if you see a weird bug try and get it!\n\n2. I would NOT gift any NPC a rare or epic item unless it's for a quest objective, it's not worth it! Also one specific bug, Duskwing Butterflies, are listed as \"uncommon\" but they're technically like epics in rarity.\n\n3. Cooking uses items from your inventory first, then from your storage, so make sure you have enough stuff to protect the things you want to keep! You can buy a locked chest from Tish's shop to keep things safe.\n\n4. For fishing, if you're trying to catch a certain fish (especially rare or epic fish), it will show you the fish before you reel it in to see if you need it or not so if you don't want it, don't reel it in! \nOnce the fish has gone back down, then reel in, as this will reset the fish and you'll keep the bait; really important for glow worms which are hard to get, but keep an eye on the condition of the rod!\n\n5. The Palia wiki is really useful for finding things.\n\n6. You'll eventually get to glowy (flow) trees, people meet up to chop these at the same time. If you hit each glowing tree once with your axe you get the same loot as everyone else who hits it, even if you don't chop it down! It's kind to let people know the location (you'll see this in chat a lot).\n\n7. You can date all the villagers with no consequence, they don't care, lol.\n\nHave fun!",

It instantly sucked me in. It's like if an MMO didn't infuriate you and it was just the good stuff. There's no combat so no worrying about dying to something that will just tick you off. I'll go into more specifics below.\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS/NPCs:\r\nThe characters in the village all have their own unique personalities that are easy to remember and you'll definitely come to have your own favorites and...less favorites. You can also initiate a romance with certain characters, something that's really cool and that I wish was incorporated into more games. The dialogue is really well-written and can change based on different factors of your character, something that really adds to the experience. You get different unique quests from the characters when you reach certain friendship goals with them, something that keeps you engaged and constantly keeps you busy with quests.\r\n\r\nQUESTS/RIDDLES:\r\nNormally, riddles infuriate me in games since I am not particularly puzzle inclined. Luckily, most of the riddles in Palia are super easy to solve. I don't have to look things up very often, which is a complaint I have a lot about other games that I've played. There are also a lot of quests which keep you quite busy so that you always have something to do, but not in an overwhelming way.\r\n\r\nSKILLS:\r\nYour character has multiple different skills (Gardening, Farming, Mining, etc.) that you can level up and get a reward when you reach the lv. 10 milestone of a particular skill. It can be a bit of a grind. It's not frustrating, but it can be time-consuming so it just depends on your preference for grinding skills to raise them.\r\n\r\nSHOP/MICROTRANSACTIONS:\r\nSince Palia is free to play, it makes sense to include some content that is paid for with real currency. As of right now, it's only cosmetic aspects (fancy clothes, tool skins, pets, gliders, etc.) that cost money. It doesn't impact that game at all, entirely the player's own preference and even if you don't want to pay for the cooler looking clothes, there are different free options for your character's outfit.",

I was hyped about this game when it first came out, and I may of been expecting a little too much for a game that just had entered closed beta. Then when open beta came, I found myself distracted by a thousand other titles instead.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER. This game has drawn me back to it a few times for my curiosity of it's charm. It has quest lines, crafting of many sorts, farming/grinding material, gold farming, and 8 skills to level; Including cooking, logging, gardening (farming), furniture making (building/decor), mining, bug catching, hunting, and of course everyone's favorite in a game, fishing. Plus, there's building up your own plot with intricate decorating and a lovely building system for it, itches that \"Sims\" game feel. The game also now has a cute minigame called hotpot that everyone wins at technically and can get you prizes, as well as parkour course. My point being, the devs ARE adding things since I first played, and that's what keeps me coming back.\r\n\r\nMy only gripe with the game, and it may be yours too, is that the map is lacking in expansion a bit. If you're someone who loves exploration, you'll enjoy the map for the first 10 hours, but after that, you kinda know where everything is easily enough. I suggest doing the quests to do more exploring and navigational puzzles.\r\n\r\nOverall, a solid 7/10 experience for the average cozy gamer who likes a healthy community and grinding game w/ somewhat MMO experience to it.",

Should be fine solo, but co-op gets ruined by so many related bugs.\n\n- Party members load invisible quite a lot so all you see is a floating name. This lasts until the next loading screen, so you can't see what they do, struggle finding them and can't coordinate properly.\n- Party sometimes breaks in a sense that one person sees the party, but the other doesn't (no party member UI, no compass visibility, friend list says you can invite people that are actually in your party, the button does nothing). This requires a restart.\n- Party member names are sometimes green, sometimes white. Sometimes you see them on the compass, other times you don't.\n- Quests sometimes only show for 1 person on the compass, but if you are next to the NPC, you will see it on top of their head.\n- Quests sometimes only genuinely appear for 1 person in the party, even though you've done everything together from the start. This causes a desync in progression.\n- Party members often show half in the floor (NPCs too), or way underground. I've even seen them run around in the basement of a building when they never even entered it.\n- Fishing rods of other players sometimes appear invisible.\n- Hunting deer is a challenge when the deer spaz and teleport around.\n- Tutorial popups are bugged in an annoying way. I keep seeing the same ones I've seen before reappearing, even had it happen twice 5 seconds apart. There is an option to disable tutorials, but that way you also won't learn anything new you haven't seen before, so it's either getting spammed by useless popups or never learning what you should. Also had a tutorial overal a developer note, which froze all my controls as I couldn't click the button behind the tutorial popup and had to restart.\n\nThese are not hardware/network issues. These are game issues. I am enjoying the gameplay as such, but these issues are frustrating.",

For a free game, you get more than what you pay for. The overall wholesomeness of the game makes it easy to get into. The community is extremely helpful and friends can be made all over. \n\nMuch like the polyamorous relationships with the pretty purple elves; the game actively encourages teamwork and bringing friends along on your errands. There are benefits to working with others and you are able to choose your own pace for the game. \n\nThe game uses real time for progression. Farming and refining materials are done over time. This makes it easy to play casually. Crafting and decorating are straightforward, but cooking has the most interesting mechanics. Preparing meals and putting them together brings an odd sense of satisfaction to my brain.\n\nThere's no combat other than hunting passive creatures, but I suspect something more substantial will be introduced beyond beta.\n\nWhy is it free? Cosmetics. That's all. Supporting the devs is a small price to pay for looking pretty and you're given a large variety of wardrobe items to work with for free anyway and you can change your appearance quite often for no fees. I pray this does not age like milk.\n\nThe greatest feature Palia has to offer is Hotpot. A deceptively addictive card game that's easy to play and easy to love. Even if you don't win a full deck, you still earn rewards. The Tower is also a fun jumping puzzle game if that's up your alley to pass the time.\n\nPalia is a great game to invest in if you're looking for a good time sink.\n\nAlso the Bluebristle Muujin can go to hell.",

Even more fun and addictive with your gf/bf, friends or really, just people around are generally really kind. It's a blast to for example go mining alone, encounter a random player who's hunting and join them on the fly. There's a lot of emphasis on freedom and grouping up with other people, while still being fun playing alone.\r\n\r\nI know it's a free game, but I'd love to see *some* options to get a premium currency slowly. The customization is there, but compared to the rest of the content it's severely lacking unless you pay real life cash.\r\n\r\nIt's everything buy pay to win, though. No P2W, no timewalls, no ads, just a solid game to play for hours on end without any pressure.\r\nIt's great to have a movie/audiobook while having Palia on the side as well",

I won't lie, I'm slightly addicted to it now.\n\nThis game is in beta and already has so much content. The game is jittery, and could do with tweaking a bit in some places, but the developers have done an amazing job already.\nThe game has fishing, farming, foraging, mining, furniture making and cooking. It has friendships and relationships, and numerous quests.\nI personally think more NPCs would be a great addition. Also more farming plots and things to grow. Also more things to hunt. But again this is still a beta game. I have clocked up over 300 hours. They have regular updates, they don't always fix the stuff that needs it, but they always add stuff. Plushies are a major hype in this game. You will find out when you download it.\nIf you're looking for a nice chilled game, then definitely download it, you have nothing to lose while it's free.",

I havent really felt anything is too repetive or anything so far and the public chat / community seems very nice! I think the size of the map is really cool and makes the idea of exploring seem fruitful with the variety of forage types.

I like the music and the atmosphere and the visuals of the game. The decorating aspect of the game is phenomenal, there are so much customization options and super cute pieces to work with. \nSome thing I'm hoping to see in the future would be the ability to have a horse or some kind of means of transport other than running, gliding, or the fast travel option. \nI also wish there was a bit more direction with some of the bigger story-line quests but this isn't a deal breaker issue.",

In general this game is a really fun cozy game and grinding for materials doesn't feel too annoying. I like how it seems to take inspiration from fun activities among a whole bunch of different games in this genre. Only ran into a couple of small bugs that got fixed very quick and never made the game unplayable. I do also like that it's not \"pay to win\" and as far as purchasing things goes it's purely cosmetic things. I thoroughly enjoy the story and game concept and it's very rewarding to play with friends with all the extra perks of teamwork.

You are confined to a fairly small world so you get to know the area quickly. It's kinda got this Disney Dreamlight Valley/Stardew thing going on so you go into town a lot getting to know the same cast of characters developing your relationship tier with them, getting rewards from them etc. \n\nThe home and garden area is a big part of this game as you can visit peoples homes if they are set to public. You expand your land, unlock tons of stuff, craft, decorate. You can even put down the gold tier fish you catch as fish tanks to show off what you've caught. Pretty neat.\n\nLike a lot of survival/gathering you need the nice pick for the big rocks, the nice axe for the big trees etc etc so there is some grind but it's all very casual.\n\nEach in game night starting 6pm until morning, players gather at this casino type area underneath the general goods store and play cards. A foodie go fish style game that rewards you with coins to spin at a wheel of fortune. The tables fill up fast which makes it pretty exciting to get a spot and have fun with the community.\n\nAnother neat community feature is the item request system. You can request a limited number of just about any items. You can help other people get items they need or request something you might need in a pinch.\n\nI had a few bugs mainly dialogue/menu related where I had to restart the game, but the stakes are so low in this game a restart is no biggie and nothing was perma bugged.\n\nOverall hard recommend. For a free game it's worth it.",

I spent about 80 of said hours completing the main story line, but I imagine people who did not venture into the sidequests, relationship and friendship quests could complete the main story line (which finished for me when I completed \"Find your Shepp,\" as it was the last thing I did in the main quest line) in a shorter time period. I am still not finished at 110 hours with friendship quests (have not maxed out any friendships yet) or relationship quests (have only completed 1 at this time). I have only just now reached Level 10 of two of the eight core skills you're expected to develop, and this is considered a Bronze Level while Level 50 of the skill is considered a Gold Level. I have not yet collected all bugs, or fish of Palia. I have not yet built all variations/collections of furniture. I clearly still have many, many hours of game-play left of Palia to complete. You do not need to spend \"real money\" in order to enjoy this game, this game completely functions without the premium cosmetics. But if you're like me, and you have such an enjoyable and incredible experience playing, buying some \"Palia coins\" to spend on cosmetics seems fitting to show your support for the game. My in-game experience with other players has been overall positive. People are helpful, informative, and generally kind. There are one-off experiences where people have strange behavior, but it's the internet. I caught on to in-game lingo quickly, scoured Internet resources and tools to learn a few quirky things about the game; but overall, I have been able to figure out how to play the game on my own or with the in-game guides/tutorials. There's been very little I've had to research on how to do because there wasn't enough instruction, really just driven by my own impatience and desire to complete collections. There's a lot about this game I still don't know about, even 110 hours into it. The seasoned players I read online and especially coming into this game during a new feature called \"Home Tours,\" WOW -- I had no idea how serious some Palia players have been the last 11 months of this game. You will see some people complaining about how there isn't enough to do or how there aren't enough updates or how the developers aren't pushing out enough content; but truthfully, a game that takes 80 hours to complete for a normal person is pretty impressive content. A game that allows you to sink an additional 50+ hours into for just fun and skill building and side-quest completion is even more impressive. People who are criticizing a lack of \"stuff to do\" have just been over-saturating themselves with it and playing too long. Trust me..... there's so much to do..... so many bugs to catch, so many things to build, so many crops to grow, so many jams to make, so many fish to lure... so many, so many, so many things to do.",

You might, I just don't.\n\nI had a lot of trouble getting the game to work. I had to go into my steam audio settings and ensure everything was set specifically to my headphones and mic(which most games just do on their own) or else the game would not load at all... then I had issues where my escape button stopped working and I had to force exit. After that, the game worked, but there's tons of audio stuttering... but, to be fair- my computer is an older one. However, I run Genshin at 60fps most of the time with no audio issues at all.\n\nI find the character designs to be a mixed bag. The player characters are serviceable- I was able to make one of my favorite OCs, but the hairstyle selection was still somewhat limited in terms of longer hair.\n\nThe NPCs are... very jarring? They're very cringe and cutesy, a bit, which... can be fine but they force you through tutorial after tutorial and it gets old really fast... there's lots of tutorial menus appearing on other tutorial menus and it just... does not stop for the first 30 to 40 minutes.\n\nI don't care for the character designs of the NPCs overall. They are just purple people with pointy ears, nothing else to them. That CAN work, but in this case it just feels random and strange... I don't feel immersed at all. There are lots of ways purple or blue elves could work; make their character designs super interesting, but they are all just random human-like people.\n\nThen there's the gameplay. Hunting and fishing are alright. Anything else... zzzzzzzzz. Very boring. The UI feels very unfinished, which for a game that's been out for a year... that's unacceptable.\n\nClimbing is buggy and messy. You'll often clip into things. There's not a lot of people, those that are there don't really talk much. Except the NPCs. They don't shut up :)",

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-17)](https://steam/76561198199326881)\nNot for introverts but extroverts will enjoy. I've played this game almost 100 hours now and while I did enjoy playing it I probably won't play for much longer. Once I got to Exquisite Level Tools it got unplayable for me personally. I am extremely introverted and I like solo playing games. I don't like talking in game chat and will do everything I can to avoid it so once you reach the stage where you need an insane amount of Flow Wood Planks then I can't really enjoy playing anymore. I don't want to have to constantly call out for help to grind flow trees that are uncuttable without a group to make cute furniture. Clothes cost ~$30 or more a set, pets are something like $15 and you can't get them any other way but through the premium shop. Crops take at least 3 hours of real time to grow with watering in between and if they aren't watered their growth pauses so no planting and logging back in later to collect. Takes an hour to process a single crop to increase it's value and you're limited to 9 plots of soil (9 plots w/ 9 spaces so 81 crops total) so you can't really grind crops for money quickly. There is also no way to trade other players or give things away to another person. You can make a request for an item you've already obtained but not one you haven't gotten yourself before and you can't ask a specific person to fill the request. Overall it's cute and a fun game to kill some time but I don't want to be forced to interact with people just to continue playing.",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-08-31)](https://steam/76561198119404184)\nI'm so obsessed with this game! There's so much to do and it's really addicting, the world feels vibrant and beautiful, and I really love the characters as well! Jel has definitely stolen my heart though. ♥ The community is also quite friendly and helpful, which is really nice to see! ♥ I haven't done much socialising though and can comfortably play the game solo or with my partner. Cosmetics like outfits and skins are monetised which kinda sucks but all the rest of the content is free, plus there is more to come as the devs keep working on improving the game. It can be a bit buggy sometimes but it hasn't turned me away from the gameplay at all, in fact, it's hard to stop. I am writing this at 3 am and I really really need to go to sleep but as soon as I wake up I will probably jump right back to it because it's my current hyperfixation. And also I need to talk to Jel. I always need to talk to Jel. Comfort game go brrrr.",

I feel like a game needs more than just gather resources, use resources and do fetch quests for boring NPCs. To me it feels like a mobile game on PC.\r\n\r\nI guess if you like to build a house, this game is OK, but even then there are games that have much better base building AND have a lot more to do otherwise. I would give it a 3/10 - there's nothing that makes you want to continue playing the game. If nothing interesting happens during the first 5 hours of a game, i feel like it's already lacking. There's no incentive to keep playing, it feels like 1/4 of a game.",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-14)](https://steam/76561198073028404)\n[h1] A Splendid and Tranquil Online Game [/h1]\nPalia unfolds in a serene embrace, where melodies drift like whispers on the wind, the world is painted with beauty, its colors soft and inviting, offering endless hours of peaceful pursuits for those who find joy in the gentle rhythm of life’s simpler tasks.\nAnd characters, with their quiet allure, that blossom in your heart over time.\n\nBasically, I like it—quite pleasing!\n\nIt's a life-sim, farm sim that you play at your own pace, with no rush whatsoever. You can play solo or get to know others and do activities together.\n\nIt shines in the art of home design, perfect for those who delight in crafting beautiful spaces.\n\nYou must know, this may be repetitive for some with its grinding mechanics. You will have to decide if it’s your thing or not, but the game is free and there aren’t any imbalances between players. You only buy cosmetics that do not influence game progression.\n\nIt has its own Wiki in case you find it hard to understand what to do, and the community is pretty helpful as well. Just ask your questions in chat, and they'll guide you.\n\n[h3] [u] It's unfinished, so it's not perfect, but it's still pretty good. [/u] [/h3]\n\nOccasionally buggy, loot can sometimes get stuck in the ground, which can be annoying. This happened to me while I was trying to catch a Rainbow-Tipped Butterfly, if I remember correctly. I spent a long time searching for it, only to find it stuck and unavailable for pickup afterward.\n\nI don't find certain puzzles in the story quests engaging; they could use some improvements, but it's not enough to make me stop playing.\n\nYour character moves rather oddly at times, especially when running short distances or climbing. These areas could benefit from some visual and physics enhancements.\n\nAnd a few other quirks scattered about.\n\n[b] I played Palia before it was on Steam, so I have more hours invested than it shows here. I've completed most of the available content. I believe it has great potential. [/b]\n\n7/10 for now.",

Cooking and hunting are our favorite things to do together. But after this last update EVERYTHING IS WRECKED!

      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-20)](https://steam/76561198002973871)\nThis game fails to deliver on it's genre.\nI would have rather paid like 25 bucks for the game instead of it being free if it made all the difference in quality.\n\nThe graphics are less that sub par using the bland washed out cartoon breath of the wild or genshin impact style, except theres no cell shading or graphical effects. The sky doesnt even have any effects for the sun or clouds. The sky is just a blank dome with a 2D image of 4 clouds that rotate on an axis 24 hours a day indefinitely. The skybox is also a low resolution texture of a mountain that you can see the rough pixel edges of without even zooming in. There are no weather effects. You don't get season changes, rain, snow, fog, anything like that.\n\nCrafting is less than rewarding. Your tools have durability and break, upgrading them costs a fortune and hardly make a difference. For example, upgrading a pick axe still requires the same number of hits to destroy rocks because it goes by damage instead of gathering time. Crafting is automated by machines that you are limited by inventory space and time to use.\n\nThe game is also severely lacking in content and full of nearly game breaking bugs, including tools failing to equip, broken animation loops, and quest descriptions that stick and overwrite newer quest descriptions. These are just a tiny few of the bugs.\n\nBug catching is a nightmare. instead of using a net, you have to forage and craft these items that copied pokemon pokeballs, which all have a small chance of successfully capturing the bugs. you can often throw up to 6 or even 8 of these at a single bug and still not catch it. The bugs dont even sell for enough money to pay for the materials used to capture said bugs.\n\nThe NPCs personalities are all very dry and you cannot actually have conversations with them, you are able to interact with them less than you can NPCs in a game like skyrim. They only talk to you when you want to, and its on par with the characters from Animal Crossing.\n\nIn fact everything in this game feels like a cheapened imitation of Animal Crossing, you roam around collecting or trying to grind for things to make pennies on the thousands of dollars it takes to upgrade your house space. Everything is time gated. There is hardly any content in the game at all, there are no big areas to explore, no combat, no dungeons with treasure, and not even any tools to socialize or express yourself with other players.\n\nThat is probably where the game drops the ball the hardest is with player interaction. There are very few clothing options in the game and they all look the same and have some kind of paisley pattern you cannot get rid of. (Paisley is the kind of pattern you find on bandannas irl.) They also want you to spend upwards of 16 to 30 dollars on a single outfit which are mostly comprised of just a shirt and pants. You cannot layer clothing, accessorize, paint or dye your clothing, its either you get it the way it is from the shop and thats it. There are also no players interacting or having conversations in town. They're all just grinding out resources and money. This is probably because theres no chat bubbles, chat console hides itself so you cannot even casually read server chat, and there arent ways to engage or hang out with nearby players. You cannot even sit on furniture in the town, much less go down to the tavern in the game and have a meal with your friends, even though there is a tavern. The character animations are very stiff and robotic, from the idle, running...and thats really the only animations your characters do. They dont really seem alive. They don't stretch, yawn, look around, or transition into other animations well at all. When you go from a hard sprint into standing again, theres about 3 frames inbetween, it looks about at rough as T-posing.\n\nThe housing system. This is the big one, probably the only part of the game where most of the budget went into. You can tell they tried to put some effort into this but its still roughly designed and not executed well. For example, you can build walls for your house so its not just one big room, the walls only go halfway up to the ceiling, you can place a wall near the ceiling instead and leave a gap near the floor big enough for you to walk through, but you cannot stack two walls on top of eachother because the ceiling height is exactly one grid space lower than the height of 2 wall pieces. so you cannot build rooms in your home.If you try to make them overlap instead, there is a massive space between the layers. Containers are cosmetic only and non-functional, you also cannot put furniture wherever you want. Want to put a flower pot on top of your dresser? you can't. Want to put up wallpaper? only for the bottom half of the wall. Want to hang things from the ceiling? you can't. Want to add a window in the corner? you can't. Want to change the walls of your house or the shape of them to not just be a big cube? you can't. Want to have a flower garden? you can't. Fireplace? no. Cupboard with items? no. You cannot do anything detailed with your house leaving it forced to look unlived in, cobbwebbs would look more believable at home in your house than a person living there.\n\nGames that did housing better than Palia and arent even life sim games: Black Desert, Elder scrolls online, Animal Crossing, Minecraft, 7 Days to Die, Raft, Craftopia, Legends of Aria, Phantasy Star Online 2.\n\nIn summary, Nothing this game has as a feature really feels in depth or immersive. You cannot specialize in a field of crafting, theres not even that many things to craft, player interaction just isnt even there (not even for roleplay.)\n\nIf i had to come up with an analogy for this game, its being thirsty and trying to enjoy a glass of water, but the cup is like 90% ice and you're constantly slurping and shaking the glass and waiting for the ice to melt to get a tiny sip and just give up and walk away thirsty when theres a full glass of water for FREE around any other corner.",

I would say this is the easiest way to make money, which you need for EVERYTHING. Want to make your house bigger - money, Want to make your tools better - money. Decorations, plot size, machinery permits, you have to pay money for everything. However the grind doesnt get easier as you progress in the game. You still have only hunting, fishing and mining. Doesnt get much faster, easier or less boring. I find it is normal thing in the begining of game to grind, but there should be oportunity to use machinery to make money later.

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-13)](https://steam/76561198105785179)\n(THis game is still in BETA, and I understand this. This review is personal yet vague enough and sorry I am not going to go into the \"whys\" of some of this review as it's again personal stuff. Just simply, my own review. This most likely will change in the future as the game develops more...\nAnyhow, okay, time for my weird and honest review:\n\n1., I love this game. It is quite addicting. It reminds me of a mixture of games, including a much older game that I grew up with that unfortunately has been shut down long when I was still young. Seeing a game with a similar-ish style and playstyle really allows me to get into this game. To me, I'd say the games are close enough and may even get more similar things added!\n\n2. Relaxing. Very relaxing. I like building games like these where you build your life from the ground up. \n\n3.  I am epileptic along with other things. And can I just say how much I ADORE there for once being a warning something???\nNot just a warning, but a warning that gives you useful ideas and instructions and really just encourages being healthy and safe! Just having a warning there to begin with really puts me at ease and shows that they care. I've talked to devs that have pretty much told epileptics \"oh, sucks to be you. Why should we cater for you?\" and that can make the world honestly feel even more lonely. I mean I get there is a whole debate that could happen right now from what I am about to say, but hey, why not just put a quick warning in your games? Like how hard is that? Or just not be lazy and make decent lighting...\nBut, I am not here to complain. I LIKE THIS GAME BECAUSE THEY TRY TO MAKE IT A GAME EVERYONE CAN ENJOY. And for the photosensitivity stuff, I give this game an A+ from me.\nBy the way,\nI have seen some *weird* stuff flash in and out in the game, but that's really just new game bugs that sometimes just aren't preventable. As for ME, I find the game's lighting and sensitivities and all to be pretty okay. I can't speak for everyone who is photosensitive, but I can say for myself the game is fairly good with that. The character creation screen *may* be sensitive to some, so just make sure to look or keep turned away away at the start of that during the dialogue until it is over.\nSeriously though, thanks for adding this.\n\n4. Einar asked how my day was, I was having a bad day and said so ingame to him, and he gave me a shiny rock to make me feel better. That actually made my day a bit better. Thanks.\n\n5. Unfortunately (due to the next thing), I can't get too much into the lore, but I wish I could. This game is full of diverse characters and quests. I love the worldbuilding and CHARACTER BUILDING especially that the devs put into this game! Very nicely done and not at all unnoticed!\n\n(the next one is a bit personal and super weird and specific and for summary, is just me blabbing about how much I dislike the game shoving humanity down my throat. So if that confuses you, just skip it)\n6., \n[spoiler]Personally I really dislike how much into humanity this game goes. I haven't fully played the quest and keep skipping the dialogue as I am someone who cannot connect to humanity in the slightest. With a game with humanoids and robots, and I am STUCK as a human in a fantasy world, I find it incredibly discouraging. If it has lore like this game, I'd want a game that focuses more on BEING AN INDIVIDUAL and not humanity. Playing as a human is overused and I really can't connect or even care about the plot because it's so centered around humanity and is constantly down your throat about it. Again I understand this is a weird opinion, but I prefer the idea of focusing more on building an individual than clumping them with a species or whatever. Especially in a game that's meant to be an escape from reality. I don't want to be a human in fantasy, why would I want that? I don't want connection to the real world at all when I play games. I like escape. Helps dysphoria a lot and helps with stress---which is WHY I like games like this. Just none that are exactly like this game exist where I can play as a freaking robot or monster or even just a humanoid/inhuman thing (just stating for context, I mean more I'd be down for playing as one of the robots or something like that). I think this game could work on that, but again this is very much a personal addition to my review and simply something I more hope the devs see, probs not but who knows. Just saying, even like just a skin or removing the characters CONSTANTLY shoving humanity down my throat every chance they have would make this game PERFECT for me. Seriously, I can't stand the dialogue because all it does is talk about a topic I am already big no about.[/spoiler] \n\n----\nWhile I understand thew devs have their own visions and for all I know my own visions could be colliding with what this game is all about, I just wanted to state it. Again, maybe any complains from I or anyone will be seen and something will be added to accommodate. I mean heck, if they are by some miracle taking inspiration off of my all-time favourite game, they may add different formes you can become like skins or spells or something for at least the human problem. Again, it's still in beta so it's whatever. I still love the game and want to support it, even if my brain at the moment may not agree with it. (sorry)\n\nAnyhow, devs, keep up the great game",

Surely Palia has many activities and skills to improve, radiant graphics and more or less big world. The NPC are cute too.\nBut... It lack of something... I've tried to analyze it and I've came to this list:\n1. Lack of color. \nIt's maybe funny, but Palia, despite of all the cozy landscapes, are mostly in two colors. Green, blue, a little bit of orange. That's all. No more differences. All tree leaves (except the said orange ones) are green. All grass are green. Flowers are rare and hard to notice. I need more colors! More contrast! It's a forest after all, where all the beauty?\n2. The claustrophobia thing. \nYour house is located in a place surrounded by fence, by the forest AND by the mountains! Even location outside the city surrounded by the mountains! I know devs are trying to locate the end of the map by that, but PLEASE find another way, it making me sick by all this height above me! You could've add ocean, cliffs, I don't know, CANYONS, but all you choose is rocks. Booriiing! (Oh yeah sorry, forgot about one ocean in one part of the city, my dearest apologies)\n3. Maybe lack of realism.\nYou don't need to sleep, you don't need to eat, you even don't have any health bar. Wolfs are running from you, the night is as bright as a day, I didn't even notice any light sources. What's that, a child game? MAYBE, but no child game are providing killing animals with arrows and harvesting MEAT from it. Even if you try to disguise it with a bag, haha, you think children are stupid? Give adult people more hardcore, I want to feel the game and my character, not just run all day by some created 3D model that has no limits! Even Minecraft has limits (hunger it is)! \n\nIn the end, the game maaaaybe good to relax, but it doesn't provide anything more. You just need to run all day ('cause you don't need to sleep), harvest everything you can and do the quests. Which there a LOT. It feels like I'm on a job and have to work day, and day, and day, and day. The difference is that I receive money by that and here I receive only more quests :D I'm scared to even open my journal, cause it filled by them, but Palia is always reminding me about my job by showing all the quests in a right side of my monitor. It's scary... \n\nLong story short, it's a game about countless hours of run errands and visibility of freedom. If you tired of doing your real job, you can change it by doing virtual job! Thrilling, isn't it? If you like that assignment, please buy Palia! Otherwise, make your decision by more relaxing games.",

The game’s whimsical art style, charming world, and emphasis on collaboration over competition set it apart in a genre dominated by high-octane action.\n\nVisuals and Atmosphere: One of the strongest aspects of Palia is its visual presentation. The art style is bright, colorful, and reminiscent of Ghibli films, with lush forests, tranquil lakes, and detailed towns. The characters and environments are beautifully crafted, giving the game a whimsical, warm aesthetic that draws players in. The soundtrack complements this atmosphere perfectly, with gentle, calming music that helps maintain the relaxed pace.\n\nGameplay: Palia centers around life skills such as cooking, farming, fishing, and crafting. The game doesn't focus on combat or conflict, making it a relaxing experience for those looking for a more casual MMO. Players work together to build homes, gather resources, and complete quests that encourage collaboration rather than competition.\n\nThe progression system feels rewarding without being grindy. As players improve their skills, they unlock new recipes, tools, and customization options. The crafting and farming systems are intuitive, and the world provides ample opportunities to explore, gather resources, and discover new areas. However, after several hours, some players may find the gameplay loops repetitive, especially those who are accustomed to more complex MMOs.\n\nCommunity and Social Features: Palia shines in its social aspect. It encourages players to form friendships and work together on large projects. Community events and co-op activities foster a sense of belonging, and the world is designed to be a shared experience. Players can visit each other’s homes, help with crafting or farming, and participate in large-scale events.\n\nThere’s also an emphasis on NPC interactions, with a rich cast of characters to befriend. The dialogue and relationship-building mechanics are engaging, and the NPCs have distinct personalities that make interactions feel meaningful. Romanceable NPCs add a layer of depth, though the relationship system is still somewhat basic in its current form.\n\nRoom for Improvement: Despite its charm, Palia isn’t without its flaws. The game could benefit from more content diversity. After mastering the available skills, there’s a lack of end-game content, which could make long-term play feel stagnant. Adding new activities, quests, and crafting options would help sustain interest over time.\n\nAdditionally, while the game runs smoothly for the most part, there are occasional bugs and glitches, such as resource spawn issues or server hiccups, which can disrupt gameplay. The developers have been responsive to feedback, so future updates may address these concerns.\n\nConclusion: Palia is a refreshing, tranquil take on the MMO genre, providing a peaceful, non-combat experience that’s perfect for players seeking a slower-paced, community-driven game. Its cozy aesthetic, focus on social interaction, and simple yet engaging gameplay mechanics make it a joy to play, especially for fans of life simulation games. While it lacks some depth in terms of end-game content, and there’s room for expansion, Palia is a promising and delightful entry into the genre.\n\nIf you're looking for an MMO that’s more about building friendships and relaxing than grinding levels or fighting bosses, Palia is worth checking out.",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-13)](https://steam/76561198385492761)\nA fine mix between animal crossing and stardew valley imo. Very fun to play with friends and exciting to see everyones creativity in world.",
      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-24)](https://steam/76561198107467511)\nWhile I've been having fun playing this game solo (ignoring the bugs and crashes), I can't give it a thumbs up. \nTheir marketing team/board members decided to implement some scummy tactics like MACRO transactions, and purchasing a in-game currency, as well as forcing you to buy more of that currency than you need, so you always end up paying more. \n\nFor a game that isn't even finished, this is insane. I wouldn't mind spending like 5eur on a skin, but 40 eur for one outfit or 10 eur for a pet is absolutely insane. Blocking players from earning anything themselves in terms of cosmetics is a major major downside and really greedy. Animal crossing does this in a much better way. \n\nI would much rather spend 40 euros once to buy the game than spend thousands just trying to buy the cosmetics. That's some EA garbage right there. And its sad because you can see the writers and artists and devs did put a lot of effort into making a cute game.\n\nThe multiplayer part also feels very half-a$sed. Yes, theres a chat and you see players running around. You can group up with a friend and see their location. But that's about it. No quest sync, no trading with friends, no mailing friends items, no dungeons or group content, you can't see each other when you're in a temple,  you can't even plant seeds for a friend. what is the point? It seems like the MMO part is just a marketing buzzword. It's about as multiplayer as elden ring is.",
      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-10)](https://steam/76561198064078023)\n1. There are no horses. Or any other mounts. How is one supposed to have a wholesome farm experience without any horses? \n\n2. The cooking mini game is the most boring and unsatisfying one i've seen in a game. I wish they'd take notes from Immortal Life, or Kynseed.\n\n3. The quests are few and far between. The world isn't living with no quests.\n\n4. The devs get no profit from designing interesting quests, or writing deep characters. All their profit comes from selling cosmetics on their immersion-breaking store for a lot of money. \n\nUnless they add some subscription option, I don't expect any quality content to be created. \n\nMore on that:\nThis game was marketed as wholesome and cozy, with healthy practices. The devs seemed like there was actually some love in the project, and were interested in making a good game for a wholesome, cozy experience. \n\nThe first red flag was the \"free to play\". No option was even offered to players to buy the game at a fair price, and/or opt to pay for a subscription and then enjoy a complete, immersive world without FOMO, tricks, predatory and stressful microtransactions, and the constant reminder of greed breathing down your neck.\n\nThe game doesn't feel wholesome. It feels superficial, and put together for the sole purpose of greed. The microtransactions are integrated in the game, in a way that kills any immersion or wholesomeness one could hope to find in a fantasy world. \n\nI haven't followed the whole drama, but i did see the trailers and marketing prior to releasing the beta, and trying out the game a year later, it was difficult to imagine that the game in that was marketed was this game i was experiencing. From what I read other people saying online, there's been a lot of drama during that year i missed. Many people blame Palia's devs for lies, unmet promises and a clear indication that this is not the wholesome feel-good game it was marketed to be, just another greedy game with no love in the making whatsoever. \n\nI guess we'll have to wait a little longer for the real deal. Too bad.",

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-01)](https://steam/76561198097422190)\nAbsolutely love this game. The quests are so in depth, the environments are beautiful, I love the skilling. It's great",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-01)](https://steam/76561199112247227)\nWhat a game!!! It definitely still has stuff to improve and bugs to be fixed, but the game play style alongside an engaging story that gives you the freedom to progress at your own pace and the social/collaborative nature of the game with fellow members of the server makes those \"negatives\" almost insignificant.\r\n\r\n If I had to ask for something it would be to give us creative freedom in certain aspects of decoration positioning which might sound like asking too much given the magnitude of improvements that can already be done to our plot. However sometimes the limitations on where an object can be placed or not inside the grid, or the lack of angles, or objects not interacting well with the surroundings do cut us short from the cozy building experience.  It would also be great if we could move the mail box and selling container to anywhere in the plot as it is a bit annoying not been able to change the way the entrance looks.\r\n\r\nWhen playing in a party with a friend, it is often that we lose sight of each other and our friend's character seems to disappear as we run around. The same way our character disappears from our friend's perspective and can result to be confusing as we try to follow each other. There is a serious need of a mini map as well! Having to rely on clicking M to open the big map limits our ability to keep moving as we locate a place. \r\n\r\nOverall the game is super fun whether you have friends to play with or not. The online open multiplayer server allows you to chat with others, ask for help, request needed items for quests or personal use, create a community and make new friends as you discover all the secrets hiding in Palia! Don't let the need for minor fixes in a game that is still in development discourage you from having a wonderful time! The game is totally worth the hype!",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-24)](https://steam/76561198203136301)\nCute little game inspired by often used Gamemechanics, which isnt bad at all. Its the perfect game for me to relax from the day. I love the fact that such a huge world is free.",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-12)](https://steam/76561197989194890)\nOccasionally buggy, quite often laggy, but it *is* still in beta.\r\n\r\nThe graphics are decent, it will run on a relatively low-spec machine quite easily, and the style is cute and consistent.\r\n\r\nThe initial quests are a little repetitive, but once you start to poke into the main story and the NPC stories it becomes very absorbing quite quickly. In fact the writing for some of the NPC stories is absolutely brilliant, as is the animation for certain characters and their body language (all of the NPCs feel well written and well fleshed out, they all have motivations and solid backstories, it's really good in most cases).\r\n\r\nThere is a certain level of grinding (chop trees, mine rocks, grow crops) but it's on the level of Stardew and it's easy to know what to do. The in-game community is generally friendly and will help out with problems, questions, fetch-quests and so on. A few quests are not very clear about what you need to do at certain points, but again the community will help if they can, and there's a good wiki online with pointers.\r\n\r\nIt needs some polishing, but there's content updates ongoing and it feels like a game that should be brilliant by the time it hits full release.",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-30)](https://steam/76561198026955611)\nLovely game that scratches the Stardew/Sandrock cozy itch with a fun and kind fantasy world. This is one of the most co-operative games I've ever played with quests, gathering, and cooking encouraging you to play with others to enjoy bonuses for everyone. I never felt the need to pay for any cosmetics, and many of them you can get for free through achievements and quests.\r\n\r\nFor a free game, I can recommend trying it to anyone who likes cozy games and enjoys playing games with others.",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-30)](https://steam/76561198161269536)\nStory is good, skills and farming are good, designing and creating your own place is great! Overall this game is relaxing and no time pressure.",
      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-30)](https://steam/76561199525711014)\nTried it with ma lil cousin, looked cozy and all and we promised us a cozy Building/exploring game from it with some quest, but well, its is a building and exploring game. With a TINY map, weird quests and boring npcs, no real game mechanics or story whatsoever and maybe , just maybe we would have tried it a bit more if we wouldnt have fallen trough the ground all the time, or just randomly being able to walk out of bounds and leave the map due to everything losing its collisions. It seems and feels like a weird and buggy mobile game and i do not recommend. Oh and did i mention you need to give em your email to play?! yeah, not recommended",

The only time you have to spend \"real money\" is when you purchase clothing, tool skins, glider skins, and animal creatures,, etc...from the Premium shop. Which honestly, is such a sigh of relief. \n\nI'm so exhausted of buying battle passes, event passes...anything passes; where it stops being free-to-play and becomes more FOMO-enraging. There are some items I can no longer get in Palia, and I'm fine for now. I'm hoping Palia will re-release some skins if there is another opportunity to get them. Especially with newer players joining up now. \n\nGardening is so much fun, and decorating my home is on another level. \n\nI think so far the only con I have about the game is I wish there was more to do. I also wish you can craft the modification item to change the color of furniture. I really dislike running all the way to kilima village and purchasing them at tish's shop to then going alllllllll the way back home. Two loading screens later, I just sigh cause it takes so much time.",

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-28)](https://steam/76561198014030732)\nPalia is a fantastic game that I've played mostly off steam, I stopped playing after a couple months and have recently come back. There are a lot of great new changes mostly revolving around the game being more friendly to get rare resources. \n\nThere is loads of things to do and to grind for, with a huge focus on community and player friendship. Over the year there still aren't many \"new\" things to do or new zones which does mean that the game gets stale still a year later after playing it for a week or so in a row.\n\nOne thing that's a really big negative that almost made me change my review is that there are a lot of community rules that aren't stated anywhere other than in the brains of the people who follow them and/or have played long enough to know them, Not knowing these rules such as Cutting flow tree groves at 3am in game time caused a large argument on the server today with me cutting too early, I did not know and wasn't told but broke some scared rule that caused a player to hurl abuse at me over chat for 20 mins. \n\nIf the community is going to create rules that are expected to be followed the developers should perhaps put these into the in game loading screens or tool-tips once they become expected. \n\nI've had these negative experiences with more players then I'd expect to for a game that at it's core is a \"Cozy MMO\".\n\nOther then this the game is really nice and the community as a whole has be wonderful.",

Everything from the world to the characters, graphics and story is so well done. Gameplay provides plenty of variety. You can collect insects, do combat, or focus on gathering and building if you so please, something that I've wished more games like this would offer. You can even build friendships and romance the other characters. This game truly has it all. Not a huge fan of having to pay for cosmetics and skins rather than earning them though. The one major gripe that I have with the game however, is the fact that it's online only. As others have said, this game really doesn't feel like it should be a multiplayer game. The servers don't seem to be too populated and the socialization between other players is nearly nonexistent aside from a few people sharing tips here and there. I think it would've been a better idea to make the game singeplayer and give those who wish to play with others the ability to create a server that others can join, similar to Palworld and Genshin, that way players don't have to rely on being connected to wifi to be able to play. The game truly doesn't need to be multiplayer in my opinion. Aside from that though, it would also be nice to have the ability to sit in chairs and benches as others have said.",

I'm honestly pretty impressed. As a big fan of simple cozy games, this game has definitely pulled me in. I'm excited to see what's to come in the future.\nOnly real gripe so far is just that I wish there were at least some options outside of the premium store to buy clothes and whatnot as I'm not the biggest fan of the base game clothes personally. On the other hand, as long as cosmetics are the only microtransactions, I can't complain too much.",

All of my free time goes into Palia either by hunting, foraging, mining, fishing, gardening, decorating my plots, completing npc/storyline quests, romancing npcs, or playing the addicting game of hot pot. You can collect plushies, and all the star quality fish, bugs, and starstones to display in your house for others to see. The community of players are super friendly and helpful to those who are new to the game. And I love how Palia implements the use of \"teamwork\"(what I refer to it as) where you can party with others to get the same drops from hunting or foraging. Not to mention the use of having flow trees that require multiple players to chop in order to obtain it's wood. There is an endless amount of things to do in this game, all at your own pace. So if you love mmorpgs, farming games, and a nice, relaxing game to hop on after a long day, Palia is definitely for you! :)",

Other mechanics like mining or building stuff reminds me of palworld/osrs but without the boredom that comes with those games.\n\nEverything is so nice in this game, NPCs and people are kind. As a former league player I'm surprised that this is actually possible. Oooh the NPC dialogs are so fun! I enjoy reading the quests storylines. I feel connected to them, they are not generic as most of MMOs out there (go to point A take item X deliver to point B).\n\nThe game reminds you of drinking water IRL and the other messages are very kind/positive. \n\nWhat a gem.

Also, this community is so friendly and informative, I haven't really seen any gatekeeping at all.

Reading Discord and other Forums, it seems they are slow to add any real expansion and have only added visual content since the Beta Release. The Update today even speaks of \"bringing back\", instead of \"look at all the new content\".\r\n\r\nThere are things you will wish you knew before you spend any Real World Cash, like buying the Plot Backgrounds, because you only get 2 free Plots, and it is the most expensive thing in game to have to purchase. I spent $80 in RWC, to find out that I still will have to work, virtually forever, to get the in-game Coin to purchase the additional Plots to show off my $80 investment in the game.\r\n\r\nI do not like that it is similar to a Browser Game, in that every time you purchase a Plot Item, the price goes up, SIGNIFICANTLY. You get NOTHING better, bigger or new, in fact, you only have 2 Main House Options even available, right now. Browser Games sell In-Game Coin for Real World Cash, but you cannot purchase Coin in this game.\r\n\r\nI am holding out hope that it grows and expands in the very near future, but I am still having fun, and there are some neat ways to decorate that are keeping me busy, for now.",

Players call out and mark rare spawns of ore, trees, plants and critters and wait for others to arrive. There's a gifting system where players help each other out with items they have had in the past but need now.  You can decorate your home plot with thousands of items from drops to different buildings and recently added building blocks. I've seen fortresses, castles and custom homes. There are bugs like any other EA game. The cash shop is a bit overpriced IMO, but only contains companion pets, cosmetics and skins so nothing in the shop is mandatory to buy to enjoy the game.",

The interactions with the npc's are fun and refreshing when their dialog changes depending on how you answer their questions. It is refreshing and more dynamic. The grind portion is not easy but it puts you in a slow pace to take it slow and relax. It has great creation dynamics to allow many possibilities to make your land unique for yourself. The main in game purchase is purely cosmetical but the entire gameplay itself is free and refreshing from games that are either pay to play or games that make you pay to get items. the prices are not unreasonable and prices for items with in game gold scales to how much money you should be making at that time using your level for each area to keep a want to work on skills but is not a full requirment to gatekeep from progressing. As well this game is great both solo and multiplayer in a very helpful community. The crossplatform progression is also a nice detail that works very smoothly.\r\n\r\nGame function flaws would be an occasonal crashs if multiple programs are running, only once but a flaw with the character appearing diffrent from original, most bugs were more so able to fix quickly.",

I genuinely enjoy *every single* NPC in this game, which is not something I have ever felt about another farm sim (despite having played a LOT of them!). I have literally cried over the back story and trauma some of these characters have shared with me, especially because the writing in the dialogue often is so well-written that it feels clear that it must have come from writers who truly empathized or had even experienced some of those things.

Hours and hours of fun and wonderful people to play with, it's perfect. \n\nMy biggest complaint is the storage space. 8 chests, even upgraded, is nowhere near enough when you get to late game. I greatly appreciate stuff like furniture not taking up space, but that is kind of expected since you can't sell it, which also sucks.\n\nAnd the other main complaint is that the controller support, while functioning and decent, it's still not great yet. Many features still require you to use your keyboard and sometimes the controller functions stop working for 1 button, like jumping or sprinting which can be frustrating if you are trying to do a jumping puzzle. \n\nAlso the last tiny complaint is that trying to set up the kitchen stuff is a nightmare. It will tell you that you don't have a stove when you have 2. What it means is you don't have a stove that you havn't unlocked yet. It took me so long to figure this out for petit fives that it means the NEXT step up from a stove that you initially start with. It was hours of headache and just sucked.\n\nOtherwise I really do enjoy playing Palia, I just hope with further work and additions that the storage, kitchen and controller's features will improve.",

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-19)](https://steam/76561198118238232)\nI've been playing Palia for a few months now, and I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical at first, being an MMO, which I had deliberately stayed away from for years. However, this is unlike any MMO I've ever played before. There is no combat, no enemies, and group play is highly encouraged. There is also no player economy, only that between you and the NPCs. \n\nMain Goals: Building your dream home in your own housing plot is the ultimate goal. And this is actually where the game starts you off. The quests are definitely worth doing for both the story line and the rewards. They opens up parts of the game you wouldn't be able to access otherwise, and many of the rewards include decor items absolutely worth having. Building friendships with the NPCs is equally important, and very similar to Stardew Valley, Garden  Paws, and the My Time at Portia game series, among others, I'm sure. The rewards for these in Palia, though, feel much more rewarding. \n\nGroup play: playing in parties has its perks; everyone gets the same loot as long as you're within a certain range of one another. However, it's not completely necessary. If you and another player hit the same rock, node, tree, game animal, etc., at the same time, you both contribute to \"tagging\" it, and you both get loot. Fishing has a bonus, too, when fishing near other players.\n\nGifting: Another aspect of group play, in regards to player economy is the gifting system. There's no trading, such as between players directly or in a party, (though this has been heavily requested), but you can request items through the social tab and another player can gift it to you that way. And to help mitigate abuse of this system, there is a daily cap on how many times you can request items.\n\nThe Material Grind: This is similar to other games in that you still have to do it almost constantly, and the rarer materials, such as Palium ore, and other foraging items, make it that much more of a grind. However, group play, in parties, or just running round with other players, and call-outs to these rare locations in chat help to make this easier. There are only two main map areas at this time, as well, and certain materials are restricted to each location respectively. There is also fishing and bug catching, and both have nice perks, which I won't spoil here.\n\nFood and Crops: You have your crops you grow in your housing plot, both for selling and for making food. The food provides what the game calls \"focus\" which gives you a boost to XP while in the world farming materials and while crafting. Food and focus are both important. \n\nMaking Money: Fish, bugs, and extra crops will be your primary money makers in the beginning. Extra crafting materials are also good money makers in later game. Crafted decor items cannot be sold, but they also do not take up inventory space in your chests. \n\nCommunities: This is Palia's equivalent of Guilds. However, it's still a work in progress. There's not much to do in Communities yet, but I hear that it's getting a face-lift, so I'm excited to see what's coming for communities. Hopefully this also includes a Community Plot and daily goals. \n\nOverall I absolutely recommend this game, whether you're a seasoned MMO player, or new to MMOs, or just looking for casual group or individual play. Since there's no combat system and everyone shares materials in the world, this eliminates most of the game stress you get from more competitive MMOs. And if you do feel stressed, or need time alone, you can simply spend hours in your housing plot building your very own palace!",

It's pretty easy to pick up on, though I will forewarn that you should look into what the \"personality signs\" are and mean as sooooon as possible. It has a sprinkling of romance in the game, but honestly it's fluff. So if this sounds good to you, it's for you. ;-}",

The only thing where you would use real-life money is for outfits, skins for your tools etc. Personally, there are a lot of outfits to choose from... but the outfits and things you can buy are really cool.\r\n\r\nComplexity: The game isn't complex, I feel this game would be suitable for any age.. however, there is relationship building in the game and i am unsure if it goes to SIMS lvl of relationships.\r\n\r\nType of game: Casual MMO, similar vibes to Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley with fortnite graphics. Difference is that it has quests, and there is no health bar... so it's quite fun being able to jump off a hill because you are too lazy to run down it.\r\n\r\nOverall: This game is quite fun, there is no pressure to do anything, however, the storyline and quests are fun!",

I really appreciate that I was able to link my account from Switch so I could keep my progress, such a great feature. As far as the game itself, there is soooo much to do in this game.

I’m normally not a huge fan of grinding for materials in games, but for some reason I really enjoy it in Palia, and can spend hours just running around grinding for the different materials. \n\nI also really love the multiplayer aspect of the game. It’s such a fun game to play with friends, and I’ve already made so many friends through this game! Even without playing with friends, the multiplayer aspect is great. (Most) people in this game are so sweet and helpful, and it’s such a nice feeling to never feel alone when playing Palia.\n\nI will say that the prices for the premium clothes and accessories is way too expensive, and the free clothes in this game are very limited. I’m happy that nothing else is locked behind a paywall, but I’m really hoping to see some better prizing of the premium stuff in the future.\n\nIf you are not a mouse and keyboard player, I would suggest being it for this game.

      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-16)](https://steam/76561198121485117)\nI WANT to recommend this game. However, doing so would be setting others up for disappointment.\n\nThis game has the potential to be one of the most comfortable and relaxing MMOs to have ever been made. I truly mean that. But in order to do that it would need to be developed by an entirely new team/company, probably. \n\nThe issues:\n1. The game is so filled to the brim with glitches and game-breaking bugs that they NEVER should have even considered it past alpha. The ground will vanish. The menus will bug out. The NPCs are almost nonfunctional. The quests will bug out. The list is actually so long I won't bother. Just know that the game BARELY functions. \n\n2. The optimization of the game is ATROCIOUS. You can run all the way to the center of the (only) town in the game and the buildings will STILL be popping into existence one wall at a time with 20 second intervals between them. The town is TINY! How?! It's truly horrid.\n\n3. This is the one that pisses me off. The thing that makes me unwilling to be patient with this anymore is that they continue to push out CONSTANT updates. \"For what?\" you may ask. \n\n[h1] IN-GAME PURCHASES and MICROTRANSACTIONS BAAAABBYYYYY [/h1] \n\nIt's the ONLY THING they care AT ALL about. They make it more and more clear as they keep releasing more real-money skins into the game. (Funny too because even these are bugged as hell. They glitch into themselves and look just truly terrible.)\n\nMy wife and I have played a lot of this game. (Mostly on Switch...which...lol don't bother...) We really were loving the comfortable relax vibes as we tried to wind down at the end of the evening. But the game has become steadily more unplayable and just filled to the brim with microtransactions. \n\nWant this game to succeed? Fire the team making these decisions and get better programmers. Until then this looks like a cash grab of the laziest nature. \n\nEdit just to add: If you try to bring up any of your concerns with this game to it's community you will be shouted down and removed from any of their communities you bring it up in. It doesn't matter how civil you try to be about it when expressing genuine concerns. For such a cozy game and a (normally) super positive community they DO NOT like when you ask questions like 'Why are the buildings not loading in anymore?\" I don't understand the zealous nature of the defense of this particular game by its players but it's kind of weird.",

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-16)](https://steam/76561198040751181)\nDo you like Breath of the Wild and wish it were multiplayer and more laid back? Do you like Animal Crossing and wish to have more freedom with how you place your decor? Do you enjoy farm sim games like Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley, or Fields of Mistria and wish it were a 3D title instead?\r\n\r\nThen allow me to introduce you to Palia!\r\n\r\nCurrently in Beta and free to play with cosmetic options for those who like some icing on the cake, Palia is perfect for anyone who wants a casual farm sim/adventuring MMO with low stakes and a lot of heart. It's very forgiving in terms of game play, where even in situations where you can die, death is not a huge setback. This is a boon to those who aren't talented in platforming, which is an aspect of the game critical to advancing the main story quest line.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of this game I specifically enjoy are the characters. They're beautifully rendered, and every single npc has something going on. From the hard-on-their-luck farming family, to the mayor's dysfunctional home, the variety and intricacies of the social circles in Palia fascinate me. As someone who yearns for variety in character design, this game is a breath of fresh air. I only wish the dating pool in Palia were a bit broader!\r\n\r\nAs this game is still in beta, there are some areas of the game that could use improvement. As previously mentioned, I would enjoy seeing more bachelors and bachelorettes added to the roster. Sifuu, Ashura, and Zeki come to mind. Yes, even though some people might find them abrasive. Okay, this includes Eloise and Caleri too. Could be fun romance paths, after all.\r\nAnother aspect I have found a little frustrating is that sometimes, quests aren't clear about the next step to take. I understand this can be used to encourage exploring. When it works, quests feel like they have a snowballing effect that's naturally rewarding. Being stymied because an objective was just a little too obtuse (and don't get me wrong, I'm a veteran of point and click adventure games so obtuse solutions aren't a deal breaker for me) can be a turn off. Hopefully the devs smooth this part out a bit. I can see it negatively impacting gameplay for some folks.\r\n\r\nLet's wrap this up with talking about the building aspect. Progression through crafting trees are fairly straightforward: gather materials, craft, invent (or buy) new recipes, and repeat. Progress rarely feels like a grind. Although there are some aspects that make a player slow down, such as when items are in a smelter or other materials processing, I find it balances out so you're freed up to go out into the world again.\r\n\r\nTL:DR; Great casual social game for folks who like farm sims with a little bit of intrigue. I think I'll be playing this one for hundreds of hours into the future.",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-16)](https://steam/76561198797595311)\nFun and exciting game play and story line. Some glitches but that's to be expected with beta testing. Some things that I wish could be added were 1. more facial feature characterization options. Right now the facial features are limited into the selection of head shape (choosing a head shape comes with eyes, nose and lips already pre-selected with that particular head shape). It would be nice to be able to choose your own eyebrow shape, eye shape, lip shape, etc. 2. Another thing that was hard for me to adjust to was trying to find people for quests. It might be nice to add a hint of when said person would out in the time of day or where to look for them. Granted most people you talk to who send you to go look for someone will tell you, but I can't tell you how many times I went looking for Hodori not being able to find him on the map. Which leads me to my next suggestion. 3. It would be nice to have a visual in-game other than the compass above the screen. Like a trail of mystical glitter to follow when you set a way-point. These are honestly my only pet peeves and they are small but the way-point one was very frustrating for me. I have ADHD and Autism so my brain gets easily distracted but wants to find the fastest route which sometimes makes it take longer to find someone--and the more I mess up the more overstimulated I become because I can't find what I'm looking for. It just makes for a not fun internal situation I have to handle over something someone who doesn't struggle with what I do might not. Definitely a fun game that I look forward to seeing the further development of and see how things unfold.",

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-16)](https://steam/76561198053548327)\nPalia is probably the coziest of cozy games with a world that's rich in lore but not quite fully fleshed out yet, but with each update usually comes new content that adds to the world's lore. I like to think of it as a cross between games like Harvest Moon, Story of Seasons, Stardew Valley, and Animal Crossing. There's plenty of skills to learn and master, tools to upgrade, and achievements to be had. Partying up is the best way to play this game not only because it's fun, but with more people, you reap more rewards. It's free to play too with the optional cosmetic purchases for your character and your plot, so if you're interested, definitely give it a whirl. You might find that you very much enjoy it.",

My first ever, 'cozy', type of game, so mostly just building up life skills and running quests. \n\nLeveling up your skills of course gets tougher the more you level up, so there is quite a bit of grind, especially if you add in grinding for money. \n\nThe climbing system can be a bit glitchy and can be frustrating when trying to climb something but your character pulls out their glider instead. \n\nCommunity seems friendly and I appreciate the etiquette when it comes to chopping down flow trees and/or palium. The server always seems to be active, so you never really feel like you're playing alone (which is something I liked about Once Human, but that game appears to have died).\n\nNot bad for a free game. Apparently the last big update had more to do with adding more cash shop items than it did actually fixing bugs and improving QOL issues, so take it for what its worth.

The game gives me Animal Crossing NH vibes in the similar ways that I catch bugs, fish, garden, gather rss, decorate and even build relationships with the npcs. I have completed the story up to where it currently is and though I know a lot of people want more, as do I, I understand the game is still very early on in its development with a fairly small team. The devs are pretty transparent with what's going on at any given time (they are pretty active on their discord). Between twitch drops and event gifts from the studio there has been a fair amount of additional items given to players that I think are a nice touch. Though there are glitches and bugs that happen with every patch, updates are fairly regular imo with one pretty much monthly that adds a decent amount of features plus fixes to the game. Considering it's a free game it is hard to argue that it's not worth it, even if you only play until the current content runs out, I think the overall design of the game and gameplay will draw back existing players as the game expands (elderwoods etc). It has been fun to meet some cool people through the game too since it is so socially driven. I also enjoy streaming it and watching other streamers play it, I think there is a lot of potential for big group events within communities who play together (though party limit is currently 4).",

There are so many neat aspects to the game, it feels like you are playing multiple A+ games. I hope they continue adding to this game because the formula they have here is perfect.",

Came back after craving farming. This game is still worked on so if you're like me when you do come back there's something new to do. I was worried that this game was abandon but no! there's way more players than I remember playing with before. Everyone is extremely nice and helpful. Especially when cutting down flow trees. \n\nI play on pc and switch. This game is pretty easy to go back and forth with which is really nice. Both have their pros and con. Switch I find cooking, and fishing to be easier to do. While I find on pc hunting and bug catching easier. My switch is older so it doesn't run that well graphics wise with this game but I take that L if it means I can lay down playing before bed. \n \nThe only money you can spend on this free game is on outfits. I respect the hustle and if you got to make money somewhere that's the best case. \n\nMy only complaint is I find getting the rare fish and bugs for the bundles quest hard to fulfilled.

I have to say, in the MMO aspect of the game, you might not find yourself interacting much with other people, but when you do the community is nice and will help you out if you need guidance.

Its a great idea and i can see it being fun for majority of people (personally not my type of game, pretty much for little kids and should have stayed on switch). However, here's my problems with it:\n\n- To actually login to make a Palia account (if u decide to), you need to change a few keys. Even when using a PC layout it didn't recognise the mouse or keyboard. If you're on steam deck, it is playable but the controls are weird af.\n\n- Character customisation is buggy, constantly changing for example a characters shirt even though u didn't click anything. This made the process longer.\n\n- Game play at first was attractive, but past that first stage, its rather boring. There's nothing attractive other than it being apparently a cozy game. I want missions and the ability to do whatever but the tutorial is long af, unoriginal characters, long and generic conversations, and...no..its boring.",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-10)](https://steam/76561198415048469)\nIt really is a nice game. It's free to play and does not pester you with sales and dubious offers. Gameplay is fun. There is no combat (afaIk), and skill progression is smooth. You can talk to villagers, fulfill quests and become friends. There is a main story, but there is no urgency to it. Basically, you can just collect resources and build a nice little home. The map is big enough to allow some exploring, yet small enough to constantly see other players. I think that the co-op aspect could still be fleshed out a little. Other than playing some mini-games or gathering resources even quicker, there does not seem to be much benefit to working together right now.",

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-09)](https://steam/76561198089381531)\nTL;DR: If you can look past some heavy, heavy bugs, the game's surprisingly deep writing and elaborate systems make it a charming, absorbing experience.\r\n\r\nI had been playing for about 4 hours when I feel under a house; something about the steps not loading correctly. The unstuck function did nothing, neither did restarting the game. Luckily, the map has a teleporting function that I could use to return home and, next time I wandered into town, everything had loaded correctly and no issues happened. I continued to play around and have fun until about  a couple hours later, when it happened again. This time, my teleport button was on cooldown (what the heck!?) and I had to stop playing because I couldn't get out from under the house.\r\n\r\nI was incredibly pissed and considering stopping for good, but this was proof that the game already had its claws on me. I was enjoying interacting with the towns-folk, all pretty stereotypical on the surface but with hidden depths which are revealed organically through talking to them and finishing missions. The many systems of the game are engrossing and interesting: fishing is not limited to pushing a button when the fish bites, cooking is not limited to adding the correct ingredients. The sense of progression feels very real, both by missions slowly unlocking one another and new systems and gadgets becoming available, and made me want to keep playing to see what unlocks next. I have a couple of minor gripes, but they're far, far outweighed by the amount of Good Brain Juice™ I get from playing.\r\n\r\nThe MMO aspect feels a bit undercooked, but it definitely fosters a friendly environment for interactions, and I think that's the most important part of it. \r\n\r\nOverall, I'll keep playing Palia as much as I can, until I inevitably fall through the ground into a limbo from which there's no escape.",

Pretty sure its a \"Free\" knockoff from that other game.\nI'm never playing this or supporting the devs again because of how much BullS*** this game is.\n\nFull of bugs, terrible netcode, over a hundred hours wasted on just trying to play the game normally via the Story (that I cant finish CAUSE of bugs.) that should have been fixed MONTHS AGO but still has a FEW fun elements.\nNot only do they just release $50 skins and one (MAYBE two) bug fixes every few months, they rebranded their ENTIRE company to hide the past failure games they've made. MOBILE GAMES.\n\nI personally Invested over $100 into this games cosmetics, and theres been no actual fixes to the game/netcode that actually matter. (THIS GAME IS VERY EASY TO EXPLOIT)\n\nTheir Social tab is a joke, it never saves parties (friend requests are always broken), chat is always down etc.\nTheir company seems to only put effort into their Assets, and NOT into the actual game servers. (which, has NO CLOUDFLARE protection btw, so their servers could be DDosed VERY easily.\n\nI love the feel of the game regardless of the bugs, but since I learned about \"Disney Dreamlight Valley\" being released first, I wont be playing this anymore or supporting the devs.\nThey keep teasing a new area, but theres no leaks, or even teaser images. Once you complete the Story (in about a Week of playing in hours) and get the highest tools, there's NOTHING TO DO.\n\nGive it a try, but good luck running it, it takes a NASA super computer to play it at an OK framerate with the version of Unreal 5 their running at MEDIUM or LOW settings!!!",

So it's more like 40+ hours)\r\n\r\nPalia is a nice, low stress, farm-ing type MMO-esque game. It's pretty alright.\r\nBut honestly, that's about the extent I can talk about this game.\r\nBecause outside of a few small niche things (Bug catching is like throwing Pokeballs) it really doesn't do much that you can't get from other farming village games. If Palia wasn't f2p, I'd probably not recommend it, but as it has no cost of entry, I'll just say: Try it for yourself.\r\n\r\nIf I had to give a reason for why I wouldn't recommend it, well, just that the game feels very shallow, and you're brick walled by so many timers, meaning you've basically got to wait a while before making very minor progressions. Means that your progression is stretched out over very little content, and when you try to engage with the content, you find out pretty quickly there's little to none of it.\r\n\r\nI stopped playing for something like a year a while back, and came back recently to see what was new, and honestly? Almost nothing substantial, but the number of items in the store has increased by like 400%. \r\nThe game honestly feels like it's a monetised time sink than a genuine experience, which is rather disappointing.\r\nPlenty of potential, not so much of it realised.\r\n\r\nTry it for yourself, but don't hold your breath.",

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-07)](https://steam/76561198057253505)\nIf Stardew Valley is to be considered as a cozy game, than Palia is... dreamy?\r\n\r\nDespite playing SV for hunderds of hours with my wife, I would never play this kind of games on my own. Too peaceful. too quiet, too slow. Yet Palia somehow combined everything that I love almost on instinct level from other games and just smashed a \"farm sim\" sticker on it. \r\n- Platforming and adventure-ish gameplay approach like in Zelda? Check. \r\n- Smooth controls, interface and social aspect remotely reminding my beloved World of Warcraft? Check.\r\n- Building system so perfect, that it looks like if Todd would give the dev team of Fallout 4 more than half-a-day to develop it? Check.\r\n- Basically, everything you need from a canonical farming/life simulator aka Stardew Valley? CHECK.\r\n\r\nThis game certainly has some grinding implemented in it, yet considering how well the world, sound and the whole vibe of this game are designed, it doesn't matter at all. You can just go with the flow, carelessly run around and do random stuff while enjoying the calming music and peaceful views and in no time you, apparently, have collected half the stuff you needed for another bundle. \r\n\r\nSurely, a decent amount of work is seen in how light and welcoming the in-game world feels. The main storyline is finely implemented in this world, it develops in front of the player with good pace and it has some sort of a mystery in it, that makes me want to find out more. But the characters are not that interesting (except for a mere couple) and they seem more generic, than writers probably wanted them to be. \r\n\r\nOverall, I am very glad that I have stumbled upon this game so randomly, and it brings me nothing but relaxation and joy so far.

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-07)](https://steam/76561198192066993)\nA little bit Stardew, a little bit Genshin, a little bit Breath of the Wild maybe, Palia has some good things going for it. It's an MMORPG with a cozy atmosphere to it. Emphasis on cozy.\r\n\r\nPROS:\r\n\r\n1) The art style is pretty. I see elements of Genshin Impact and Breath of the Wild here, but Singularity 6 makes their own artistic mark, too. It's really quite attractive. I like the little details, like that you can see the breeze blowing.\r\n2) The characters are memorable individuals with their own personalities and stories. You can even romance some of them, like Tish, the carpenter cutie.\r\n3) You can build your own homestead/dream house, and deck it out in decorations of all kinds. Want a farmhouse? A cottagecore cottage? A witchy abode? Something with fashionable chic? You can probably build it.\r\n4) There's 8 different professions you learn along the way. While some may be familiar, such as mining, some also seem unique to this game (or at least unique to a small handful of games), such as bug catching and furniture making.\r\n5) The world is interesting and beautiful. It's small, because they just released it into beta like a year ago, but it already has a thriving community. There's a bunch of how-tos on YouTube, 3 or 4 wikis, and some interactive maps online. There's currently only two adventuring zones, Kilima Valley and Bahari Bay, but Singularity 6 is working on their third: The Elderwood. Despite its small size, there's plenty to do. Decorating your homestead will keep you busy for a while just by itself.\r\n6) At least for right now, while it's in beta, Palia is free to play. No subscriptions, no season or battle passes, none of that nonsense. Just download, make a character, and get lost in this world.\r\n7) It's RELAXING. You can't die. There is no fall damage. You don't pass out like in Stardew. In fact, the late hours give you access to special materials, like magical flow wood. It's not violent, either. The hunting, for example, drops a loot bag. No skinning, or bones, or anything gross. I'm not sure if Sing-6 is going to change it (I hope not), but you can go anywhere without fear of aggroing a monster that lays you flat. It's truly relaxing.\r\n\r\nCONS:\r\n\r\n1) I'm having an issue with storage. You can get up to 5 bars in your backpack, but you run out of space quick. You start with 3, I believe, the 4th one is 5K gold, and the 5th is a whopping 25K gold (I'm having some trouble building up that amount. You know how you can make and utilize as many storage chests as you want in Minecraft? Not in Palia. You can only set down eight, and they fill up rapidly. Hoarding stuff for cooking or furniture making is difficult, because it all takes up precious space. I'm hoping they fix this soon. I'd like to build a storage warehouse on my land.\r\n2) There's some place you can get stuck, which has happened to me a few times. They have a button on the main menu for a stuck character, so that's good. But, it's still annoying. I've also seen other players sink into the ground a little. Occasionally, an NPC appears to have a pathing problem, where their walking becomes stuttered or they scooch along the ground without moving. Again, beta.\r\n3) They have a lot of interesting outfits and stuff in the game store. As far as I can tell, none of it is game-changing, so no pay-to-win. It's all just cosmetic. However, more than a few people have mentioned it being a little spendy, so you have to decide whether it's worth it if you're thinking of buying something. I think it's how they make their revenue, because the game is free to play right now. I'm not sure how else they make money.\r\n4) The progression feels a little slow, but since the world is still small, the rate of progression might be a good thing right now. After profession level 5, hunting, fishing, foraging, mining, and bug-catching seem to slow down a lot. A little patience is necessary, but the pace isn't insurmountable. They may tweek it a bit when the world gets bigger, and they finish with beta testing.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I love this game. I've only been playing for maybe 3 weeks, and I immediately fell in love with it. It's cozy enough to be called a cozy game, but there are some challenging aspects to it. I look forward to what Sing-6 comes up with. They seem to care about their work and the players. Let's hope that attitude continues, and they don't someday succumb to Triple-A Mentality.\r\n\r\nGive it a try! If you don't like it, if it's not for you, you haven't lost any money.

Even then, there's still plenty to do. The only thing you need to pay for is cosmetic items, which honestly is understandable since the game is free. The characters are enjoyable and have a lot of personality, and the game actually rewards you for playing with a group (though it's not required)!",

If you like either one, I suggest you give Palia a try. It's completely free, as well, except for cosmetics. Unfortunately, there are no cosmetics that aren't real money. The style is pretty and the characters are charming.",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-06)](https://steam/76561198068657770)\nPalia is a great game both at first glance and otherwise. Word of warning, if you like fast paced combat, non-stop action, and strategy this is not the game for you. If you however like peaceful venues, meditative music, great roleplay, and having fun with your friends this game has it all. You can build your own houses, you can have a bit of romance if you want, you can explore the entire map freely, and build all the furniture there is in the game and decorations. There are rewards for completing tasks and leveling sills, and trophies for hitting milestones. This is a lot of content considering that this game is still in beta. This game developer is clearly in it for the right reason, they clearly know what their audience wants, and they are promising more content to come... in fact their most recent patch added MORE furniture you can craft and collect. Despite not having any fast paced action I have already spent 172 hours in this game at the time of writing this review. This game makes it clear that you don't need fast paced action or strategy to enjoy a game, this is by now means a game like SWTOR, Skyrim, ESO, and The Fallout Series, and I am quite fine with that. Palia is not for fans of those franchises, and to be fair I have encountered very few bugs when compared to those games. The developers don't force you to spend money on unnecessary things to enjoy the great majority of the game, but they have this option. Most if not all of the things in this game can be crafted or bought with in game currency that you gain through in game means. WIll they at one point charge for this game? maybe but that day has not come. My belief is that they are doing fine at the moment with the players they have and with selling in game items and have no need for it at the moment. I do not foresee that this will change anytime soon but i would not mind it if it did change, because this game in every sense of the word is a paradise. It is calming and exciting, and makes me content. It is a game that is easy to play and because of it's nature there is no possibility of griefing like other games; this fosters a helpful and kind community. In conclusion is implore you, give this game a chance. You will not be sorry.",

Secondly, there is so much fun stuff to do if you enjoy cozy games like stardew valley. It reminds me a bit of Grow:Song of the Evertree,  but if you could hunt. it has a similar vibe to that game imo. \r\n\r\nEvery single person I've met on this game has been super kind and helpful. Its genuinely such a chill vibe. The downside for me is that it is a little bit glitchy at times, the party system only works half of the time, and i ruined a star quality dish because it froze the cooking animation ;-; (its hidden in my house now ^^)\r\n\r\nOverall, solid 10/10 for me. Its so fun and chill. And again, its FREE! give it a try c:",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-06)](https://steam/76561198027873444)\nDon't get me wrong, this game has is problems.\r\n\r\nThere are still things that are a bit glichy, or don't work the way you'd think they should. For instance, climbing isn't perfect. Sometimes when you glide to a wall you grip it and then fall down it a little before you start climbing. I'm not hugely fond of the trade system in the game. I understand the reason they had it set up the way they do. They are trying to prevent people from getting things they haven't gotten themselves from other players. It just makes it a little frustrating when you spend a few hours trying to catch a fish and never see it, but your friend has one they don't need. \r\n\r\nThat being said, this game has given me hours of fun fishing, mining, foraging, cooking, gardening, decorating, befriending the villagers, etc. There is so much to do, a bunch of little puzzles in the world, and over all the game play is fun. As a free to play game, I was willing to spend some money on cosmetics because I got enough enjoyment out of the game to spend it.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot to love here in a cozy game. The cooking is a lot of fun. You can cook with your friends, and each person who helped gets a stack for themselves. The fishing is relaxing, the mining/logging/foraging is straight forward and satisfying, the bug catching is fun and a nice edition to the game, and by far the best part of it all is meeting all of the villagers and building your relationship with the town. Finding out their likes and dislikes, and seeing their reaction when you gift them what they want for the week. \r\n\r\nI would say despite some of the little bugs here and there, the game itself is well worth playing.",

Everything is so smooth and thought out. Great story line and side quests and hidden content to find and complete. I only have one true issue with this game and its that fact that there just is not enough storage space, like why cap us at 8 chests? Once you get far in the game you just can't do anything without deleting your resources to add what you need for something us. For such an amazing,peaceful and just fun adventure crafting game there just isn't enough storage space to store all of the things are hording crafting hearts desire.

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-03)](https://steam/76561198137338095)\nPretty chill game. The housing customization has a good amount of freedom to it and the professions are both intertwined and can give you something to place in your house/s (for the most part, not sure if you can craft food that can be placed). The community also seems to be nice. I saw people calling for other players in chat when they see a rare resource so that others can go there and take it as well, which left an impression on me. And there\\s a gifting system where you can request for an item and others can give it to you which also encourages cooperation.\r\nGranted there are some mobile game-esque mechanics like waiting more than 10 minutes for a resource to be prepared, but you can't rush it with premium currency so I feel it's there mostly to put an emphasis on slow play, which is a good mentality to have with such games.\r\nThe game is free to play with the option to buy cosmetics so there's little reason to not try it out if one's interested.",

It feels to me like somebody ran Oblivion through a Stardew Valley filter, and I love it. The NPCs are charming (many of them quite cheesy, in the absolute best way) and the design of both the village and the landscapes are as well, and the critters are varied enough to stay interesting as you explore. The quests are sometimes tricky to figure out what or where you're supposed to do and go, but the puzzles themselves are tricky enough to be pleasant without being frustrating in their difficulty or complexity. Everything seems well-paced, quests and skill-progression and character relationships. \r\n\r\nAll in all it's a wonderful experience, and the fact that the predominant attitude of the other folks playing online seem so far to be amiable has been a refreshing relief, as is the fact that the world rarely seems so crowded with other players as to overwhelm any given area. I've only been playing for a week so far, but so far I absolutely love it, and have no intention of stopping.",

I don't have any complaints at all, but I do wish that they would add a system where you can earn, craft, or buy clothing/pets (with in game currency). It doesn't have to be as fancy as the premium items, just something fun or cute. I understand the developers need to make money somehow, but it's just kinda sad, y'know?

I've been going through a rough time and my brother recommended this game as a casual and laid back experience. There's no combat, rather there are 8 skills that you can level up by using those skills. There is an adventure aspect to it, even a few \"dungeons\" which are puzzle-based, like a lighter version of a Legend of Zelda puzzle. The game does get grindy, where you need to keep fishing or catching bugs over and over, and there are a few improvements that could be made, I.E. giving residents gifts from your storage would be nice, instead of having to run back to my home, check who wants what, and pull it all out of the chests. There is a crafting aspect to the game for tool upgrades, smelting and building a home, but even that gets difficult to keep up with as things become pretty expensive pretty quickly.

It didn't like my graphics driver so i spent a half hour trying to update it. It didn't work for some reason but that's intel's fault not Palia's. I go to play the game anyway even without the best graphics and it gives me an error, I try 3 times. Looking up the error, I find that others who have tried to play Palia have been getting that error since this game was first launched with no fix or comment from the developers. Someone posted a supposed fix on reddit but it would involve changing the game start-up code and I wasn't comfortable with that. This game finished downloading at 7:30pm and i decided to just uninstall at 9:20pm. Never played. The 21 minutes was all figuring this out.",

There are better options for you out there.\n\nSome of the character designs are cool though, the fishing robot is genuinely one of the most fun designs I've seen in a while.

However, I positively despise most mechanics and other things about the game. I have played Palia on all available platforms during several different stages of its development. The developers of this game should be embarrassed at the lack of professionalism within it. The real money store is a predatory ploy for young players. The waiting periods for crafting are absurdly long and make the game feel like a mobile game. The additions to this game are extremely slow to arrive and often do not arrive on the expected date. There are frequent keybinding and clicking bugs that must be solved by players. The list goes on. I keep coming back to this game waiting for it to be something that it isn't; good. I'll probably still play as long as it's free to do so, but I do not recommend anyone getting into it at all.",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-06)](https://steam/76561198074432946)\nPalia isn’t full of brand-new game mechanics, but it combines ideas from other cozy and farming games really well. Together, they create a fun and unique experience.\r\n\r\nI really like the game’s story and how magic fits into it. There are plenty of activities like bug catching, foraging, fishing, cooking, etc. While the grind can feel long, having lots of options makes it more enjoyable. If I get bored mining, I can just switch to cooking or fishing.\r\n\r\nThe developers are also doing a good job with updates, and it’s nice to see the game grow.\r\n\r\nThere are still some bugs, and a few of them are serious, but the developers are working to fix them regularly. My biggest issue is the lag, which I get both on PC and Switch. Also, using a gamepad feels awkward.\r\n\r\nI’d love to see more locations added. Right now, we only have Kilima and Bahari Bay. Underwater areas or weather changes would be great. I also miss having seasons. During the 2023 Christmas event, the snow looked odd next to all the greenery and butterflies.",

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-29)](https://steam/76561198827593665)\nOkay. I am writing this review with only about 4-5 days of me playing this game. You be the judge if I like this game or not.\n\nFor being a Beta game it surely has a lot and is fun. Already got me spending money to buy some clothes. But overall this game is very fun. Similar to Stardew Valley but it's coop and has of course it's own features to it. There's a learning curve to this game and it gives you a vague description or tutorial on how to do things, so I get why it's overwhelming to many. Google will be your best friend with this game. The community is VERY FRIENDLY. Everyone is so nice. There's some unspoken Palia Ethics already which I love. \n\nOverall, just needs some more tutorials for beginners and some items. I do hope they publish a \"Trade with Other Player\" feature and some Farm Animals and possibly a Mount you can ride, since it's a bit difficulty to get to one place to another.",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-28)](https://steam/76561198124741888)\nFor a free game that's in beta still, you can see by the play hours of the positive reviews this game already offers a lot, and I had a really good time with it!\n\nHere I'll go through what I was looking for before playing, the pros and cons and then offer some tips at the bottom. \n\nBasically:\n+ lovely peaceful game\n+ lots to do\n+ not greedy devs, cosmetics only\n- very buggy\n- story and design still in beta\n\nHow free is it? \nIt's just cosmetics; there's no way to pay to be better or faster. When you log in the first time, there's a message from Singularity 6 which basically says \"if you like our game please tell people about it\" which I thought was really nice, I never felt pressured to spend, I bought a couple of cosmetics to support them for giving me 100 hours of enjoyment.\n\nWhat is the gameplay?\n\nVery casual and easy-going, it's based around building your home and the core skills which you level up; bug catching, cooking, fishing, foraging, furniture crafting, gardening, hunting and mining. As you level up you unlock more things you can craft for each skill and these skills are how you interact with the story, complete objectives and challenges.\n\nThe villagers work the same way; you level up your relationship with them to unlock cool things and more quests, they also provide the structure; context to the quests and objectives you'll be completing. A small part of this is the main story line, which is pretty interesting so far, but I'd say like 10% complete at the moment. There are other stories of different villagers which are complete to varying degrees, since the game is in beta. I'll say the few cutscenes that are finished are really nice.\n\nThis happens across two maps Kilima (medium sized) and Bahari (large sized), and there's a lot of running around, but there's no fall damage and nothing can hurt you. There is fast travel, but the game does not point it out (I'll get to that). \n\nEverything important to the game tends to work well and is fun! It didn't lag at all or crash hardly at all. I was able to do most of everything required in the game without big issues.\n\nNow, there are some negatives to consider; being a beta this game has many, many smaller bugs!\n\nIn my time almost everything you can think of had some sort of glitch (maps, menus, chat, gameplay, etc); there's a lot so here are some examples of the prominent common issues I had, as experienced played with a controller:\n\n1. Menus can be jank, it gets stuck and you have to switch to the next tab and then back to fix it. Sometimes also you press a button to do one thing and it does something else which uses the same button. \n\n2. The map can be jank, you select one villager to track and it keeps selecting somebody else far away.\n\n3. Also, from the map you can press a button to teleport home; this button is the same as the run button, but sometimes after closing the map menu, the game thinks it's open when it's not, so when you return to game and go to run you teleport home when you don't want to; since the areas are large and you have to wait before you can use the home teleport again, this bug was by far the most annoying!\n\n4. You have a wheel to select the tool you want, sometimes it selects the same tool over and over again and you miss out on a rare insect or hunting opportunity because you can't put your fishing rod away in time.\n\n5. Visually, EVERYBODY, every NPC and player, bug out; they're gliding across the floor, standing in the ground, floating above the ground, walking in place, walking through walls, appearing to fall, some players even get stuck under the inn. You can buy a cosmetic pet that runs around with you, but I couldn't use it because it was constantly bugging out and distracting me; dropping from the sky in front of me or flipping out, and other player's physics items are always stretching and glitching out. Mostly this happens when you first get there and from a distance, but not always. It did not affect the gameplay but it's absolutely something you'll notice, even if you do get used to it quickly.\n\n6. A few NPC positions can make it hard to interact with them or around them, like Hassian stands on the same exact spot as his dog Tau, and Shiffa blocks access to her own anvil, so you have to jump around to find the specific spot needed.\n\n7. I had a constant bug where my character would keep turning 180 degrees when still to face the camera; I HATE this bug, especially when you're around other players, lol.\n\nThere are design issues too: \n\n1. Lack of tutorials for important or basic things, or tutorials appearing far after you need them when you're first starting. I had to look up basic things on my phone because simple, obvious things like dragging and dropping would not work.\n\n2. You can't sell furniture you make, even for the price of the materials or for 1 gold just to get rid of them; you have to store or destroy furniture.\n\n3. NPCs sometimes ask for outrageously rare items for little to no reason.\n\n4. If you don't enjoy one of the skills it can take a long time to reach the level up needed (like I don't enjoy cooking). A few quests require items only obtainable by progressing far in one of these skills, but there should always be another way to get these items, even if it's tricky, otherwise you're forcing players to grind something they don't enjoy. This was rare but still an issue.\n\n5. Lastly, I'd say some of the quests require a lot of work and have a little or no pay off (Jina's picnic, Tish's dance) I again assume due to being beta. Some quests are very anticlimactic and end with no real consequence.\n\nOverall:\n\nEven despite all of that jank I had a great time with this game. This main gameplay of using your skills to help NPCs and unlock things as you play was peaceful and mostly fun and rewarding, you can decorate your property quite impressively, and throughout the game it's fun discovering what you can unlock you had no idea about. \n\nThere's a review saying this game is not for introverts but I really have to disagree, I think there's one quest that might need interaction (fulfil a player request). If you do want to talk the game is basically full of people who just want to chill and build a cool little house, so I found people really chill and helpful anyway. Totally recommend!\n\nTips!\n\n1. Know what you have! \n\nThere's a lot of rare and epic items in the game, some which can take days to find if you're looking for them, which you might find by chance, so if you're just starting and you get an epic bug or fish that you don't know what to do with, keep it! (as you might want it later for something to do with a door and night sky temple) and if you see a weird bug try and get it!\n\n2. I would NOT gift any NPC a rare or epic item unless it's for a quest objective, it's not worth it! Also one specific bug, Duskwing Butterflies, are listed as \"uncommon\" but they're technically like epics in rarity.\n\n3. Cooking uses items from your inventory first, then from your storage, so make sure you have enough stuff to protect the things you want to keep! You can buy a locked chest from Tish's shop to keep things safe.\n\n4. For fishing, if you're trying to catch a certain fish (especially rare or epic fish), it will show you the fish before you reel it in to see if you need it or not so if you don't want it, don't reel it in! \nOnce the fish has gone back down, then reel in, as this will reset the fish and you'll keep the bait; really important for glow worms which are hard to get, but keep an eye on the condition of the rod!\n\n5. The Palia wiki is really useful for finding things.\n\n6. You'll eventually get to glowy (flow) trees, people meet up to chop these at the same time. If you hit each glowing tree once with your axe you get the same loot as everyone else who hits it, even if you don't chop it down! It's kind to let people know the location (you'll see this in chat a lot).\n\n7. You can date all the villagers with no consequence, they don't care, lol.\n\nHave fun!",

Toss in a premium store for real money, and I'd much rather pay for an actual game with a bit more depth to it.\n\nPerhaps down the line they'll add more complexity, but considering that this is an online co-op game, I doubt it.\n\nYour mileage with it may vary if you like online co-op or have younger kids.  However, I'll note that I noticed several inconsistencies with the UI not showing me the location of certain quest givers or other objectives.  I'm an old school gamer, so this didn't bother me much, but younger players may find it frustrating.\n\nTo summarize - for me this is a pass, but it is free, so give it a try.",

It's like if an MMO didn't infuriate you and it was just the good stuff. There's no combat so no worrying about dying to something that will just tick you off. I'll go into more specifics below.\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS/NPCs:\r\nThe characters in the village all have their own unique personalities that are easy to remember and you'll definitely come to have your own favorites and...less favorites. You can also initiate a romance with certain characters, something that's really cool and that I wish was incorporated into more games. The dialogue is really well-written and can change based on different factors of your character, something that really adds to the experience. You get different unique quests from the characters when you reach certain friendship goals with them, something that keeps you engaged and constantly keeps you busy with quests.\r\n\r\nQUESTS/RIDDLES:\r\nNormally, riddles infuriate me in games since I am not particularly puzzle inclined. Luckily, most of the riddles in Palia are super easy to solve. I don't have to look things up very often, which is a complaint I have a lot about other games that I've played. There are also a lot of quests which keep you quite busy so that you always have something to do, but not in an overwhelming way.\r\n\r\nSKILLS:\r\nYour character has multiple different skills (Gardening, Farming, Mining, etc.) that you can level up and get a reward when you reach the lv. 10 milestone of a particular skill. It can be a bit of a grind. It's not frustrating, but it can be time-consuming so it just depends on your preference for grinding skills to raise them.\r\n\r\nSHOP/MICROTRANSACTIONS:\r\nSince Palia is free to play, it makes sense to include some content that is paid for with real currency. As of right now, it's only cosmetic aspects (fancy clothes, tool skins, pets, gliders, etc.) that cost money. It doesn't impact that game at all, entirely the player's own preference and even if you don't want to pay for the cooler looking clothes, there are different free options for your character's outfit.",

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-23)](https://steam/76561198124217611)\nHonestly, yes. I was hyped about this game when it first came out, and I may of been expecting a little too much for a game that just had entered closed beta. Then when open beta came, I found myself distracted by a thousand other titles instead.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER. This game has drawn me back to it a few times for my curiosity of it's charm. It has quest lines, crafting of many sorts, farming/grinding material, gold farming, and 8 skills to level; Including cooking, logging, gardening (farming), furniture making (building/decor), mining, bug catching, hunting, and of course everyone's favorite in a game, fishing. Plus, there's building up your own plot with intricate decorating and a lovely building system for it, itches that \"Sims\" game feel. The game also now has a cute minigame called hotpot that everyone wins at technically and can get you prizes, as well as parkour course. My point being, the devs ARE adding things since I first played, and that's what keeps me coming back.\r\n\r\nMy only gripe with the game, and it may be yours too, is that the map is lacking in expansion a bit. If you're someone who loves exploration, you'll enjoy the map for the first 10 hours, but after that, you kinda know where everything is easily enough. I suggest doing the quests to do more exploring and navigational puzzles.\r\n\r\nOverall, a solid 7/10 experience for the average cozy gamer who likes a healthy community and grinding game w/ somewhat MMO experience to it.",

      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-21)](https://steam/76561197973193893)\nThis could be a great game, but it's an absolute bugfest. Should be fine solo, but co-op gets ruined by so many related bugs.\n\n- Party members load invisible quite a lot so all you see is a floating name. This lasts until the next loading screen, so you can't see what they do, struggle finding them and can't coordinate properly.\n- Party sometimes breaks in a sense that one person sees the party, but the other doesn't (no party member UI, no compass visibility, friend list says you can invite people that are actually in your party, the button does nothing). This requires a restart.\n- Party member names are sometimes green, sometimes white. Sometimes you see them on the compass, other times you don't.\n- Quests sometimes only show for 1 person on the compass, but if you are next to the NPC, you will see it on top of their head.\n- Quests sometimes only genuinely appear for 1 person in the party, even though you've done everything together from the start. This causes a desync in progression.\n- Party members often show half in the floor (NPCs too), or way underground. I've even seen them run around in the basement of a building when they never even entered it.\n- Fishing rods of other players sometimes appear invisible.\n- Hunting deer is a challenge when the deer spaz and teleport around.\n- Tutorial popups are bugged in an annoying way. I keep seeing the same ones I've seen before reappearing, even had it happen twice 5 seconds apart. There is an option to disable tutorials, but that way you also won't learn anything new you haven't seen before, so it's either getting spammed by useless popups or never learning what you should. Also had a tutorial overal a developer note, which froze all my controls as I couldn't click the button behind the tutorial popup and had to restart.\n\nThese are not hardware/network issues. These are game issues. I am enjoying the gameplay as such, but these issues are frustrating.",

I always just assumed it had some really poor Pay to Win features that I didn't want to find out about but boy was I wrong.\r\n\r\nIf you love Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing and really any sort of Farming Life Game, then by all means give Palia a shot. You have a lot of things to do. You can Farm Crops, Cook Foods, Smelt down Ores, Craft Furniture, Become friends with people which leads to romancing them. There are a bunch of quests you can do for rewards. You gain a lot of tools early on which allow you to Chop, Mine, Fish, Catch Bugs, Farm and so much more. You get your own Plot of land where you can build a house and really just customise your own home however you want.\r\n\r\nJust a very fun pass the time sort of game.

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-11)](https://steam/76561198089202896)\nIf Stardew Valley and Dreamlight Valley had a spicy love affair, you get Palia. For a free game, you get more than what you pay for. The overall wholesomeness of the game makes it easy to get into. The community is extremely helpful and friends can be made all over. \n\nMuch like the polyamorous relationships with the pretty purple elves; the game actively encourages teamwork and bringing friends along on your errands. There are benefits to working with others and you are able to choose your own pace for the game. \n\nThe game uses real time for progression. Farming and refining materials are done over time. This makes it easy to play casually. Crafting and decorating are straightforward, but cooking has the most interesting mechanics. Preparing meals and putting them together brings an odd sense of satisfaction to my brain.\n\nThere's no combat other than hunting passive creatures, but I suspect something more substantial will be introduced beyond beta.\n\nWhy is it free? Cosmetics. That's all. Supporting the devs is a small price to pay for looking pretty and you're given a large variety of wardrobe items to work with for free anyway and you can change your appearance quite often for no fees. I pray this does not age like milk.\n\nThe greatest feature Palia has to offer is Hotpot. A deceptively addictive card game that's easy to play and easy to love. Even if you don't win a full deck, you still earn rewards. The Tower is also a fun jumping puzzle game if that's up your alley to pass the time.\n\nPalia is a great game to invest in if you're looking for a good time sink.\n\nAlso the Bluebristle Muujin can go to hell.",

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-09)](https://steam/76561199376585986)\nI have this game on my switch and steam, and must admit I've played mainly on the switch because it's easier for me at the moment, but I highly recommend this game.\n\nI downloaded it 5 months ago when I was after a cheap new game, something to kill the time while my newborn was sleeping.\n\nThe first few days of playing I won't lie I was bored senseless, and was ready to give up, but I decided to give it another go and I'm so glad I did. I won't lie, I'm slightly addicted to it now.\n\nThis game is in beta and already has so much content. The game is jittery, and could do with tweaking a bit in some places, but the developers have done an amazing job already.\nThe game has fishing, farming, foraging, mining, furniture making and cooking. It has friendships and relationships, and numerous quests.\nI personally think more NPCs would be a great addition. Also more farming plots and things to grow. Also more things to hunt. But again this is still a beta game. I have clocked up over 300 hours. They have regular updates, they don't always fix the stuff that needs it, but they always add stuff. Plushies are a major hype in this game. You will find out when you download it.\nIf you're looking for a nice chilled game, then definitely download it, you have nothing to lose while it's free.",

I havent really felt anything is too repetive or anything so far and the public chat / community seems very nice! I think the size of the map is really cool and makes the idea of exploring seem fruitful with the variety of forage types. Also the fact that some villagers live in different sections of the 2 maps makes you have a reason to go between. I'm definitely going to recommend this game to my friends with the preference of having the graphics low if you dont have that great of a pc.",

Worth the download, doesn't feel like a \"free\" MMO game. It is a good quality game with seemingly lots to do without being too repetitive or overwhelming. I like the music and the atmosphere and the visuals of the game. The decorating aspect of the game is phenomenal, there are so much customization options and super cute pieces to work with. \nSome thing I'm hoping to see in the future would be the ability to have a horse or some kind of means of transport other than running, gliding, or the fast travel option. \nI also wish there was a bit more direction with some of the bigger story-line quests but this isn't a deal breaker issue.",

But this game works and runs much more seamlessly on PC. The graphics are of course better as well. In general this game is a really fun cozy game and grinding for materials doesn't feel too annoying. I like how it seems to take inspiration from fun activities among a whole bunch of different games in this genre. Only ran into a couple of small bugs that got fixed very quick and never made the game unplayable. I do also like that it's not \"pay to win\" and as far as purchasing things goes it's purely cosmetic things. I thoroughly enjoy the story and game concept and it's very rewarding to play with friends with all the extra perks of teamwork. Very clean game design and the sound effects and voice lines are wonderful and very relaxing. <3 I'd say it's a solid 9.5/10 I love this game and cannot wait for the full release. :3 Would also love more animal/creature themed outfits!",

That's not always a bad thing, since whatever waylaid you, you needed anyways or was better than what you were first doing.

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-03)](https://steam/76561198052273706)\nVery chill and addicting. You are confined to a fairly small world so you get to know the area quickly. It's kinda got this Disney Dreamlight Valley/Stardew thing going on so you go into town a lot getting to know the same cast of characters developing your relationship tier with them, getting rewards from them etc. \n\nThe home and garden area is a big part of this game as you can visit peoples homes if they are set to public. You expand your land, unlock tons of stuff, craft, decorate. You can even put down the gold tier fish you catch as fish tanks to show off what you've caught. Pretty neat.\n\nLike a lot of survival/gathering you need the nice pick for the big rocks, the nice axe for the big trees etc etc so there is some grind but it's all very casual.\n\nEach in game night starting 6pm until morning, players gather at this casino type area underneath the general goods store and play cards. A foodie go fish style game that rewards you with coins to spin at a wheel of fortune. The tables fill up fast which makes it pretty exciting to get a spot and have fun with the community.\n\nAnother neat community feature is the item request system. You can request a limited number of just about any items. You can help other people get items they need or request something you might need in a pinch.\n\nI had a few bugs mainly dialogue/menu related where I had to restart the game, but the stakes are so low in this game a restart is no biggie and nothing was perma bugged.\n\nOverall hard recommend.

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-01)](https://steam/76561199017133162)\nAfter playing this game for roughly 110 hours, I can safely say it's worth the time. I spent about 80 of said hours completing the main story line, but I imagine people who did not venture into the sidequests, relationship and friendship quests could complete the main story line (which finished for me when I completed \"Find your Shepp,\" as it was the last thing I did in the main quest line) in a shorter time period. I am still not finished at 110 hours with friendship quests (have not maxed out any friendships yet) or relationship quests (have only completed 1 at this time). I have only just now reached Level 10 of two of the eight core skills you're expected to develop, and this is considered a Bronze Level while Level 50 of the skill is considered a Gold Level. I have not yet collected all bugs, or fish of Palia. I have not yet built all variations/collections of furniture. I clearly still have many, many hours of game-play left of Palia to complete. You do not need to spend \"real money\" in order to enjoy this game, this game completely functions without the premium cosmetics. But if you're like me, and you have such an enjoyable and incredible experience playing, buying some \"Palia coins\" to spend on cosmetics seems fitting to show your support for the game. My in-game experience with other players has been overall positive. People are helpful, informative, and generally kind. There are one-off experiences where people have strange behavior, but it's the internet. I caught on to in-game lingo quickly, scoured Internet resources and tools to learn a few quirky things about the game; but overall, I have been able to figure out how to play the game on my own or with the in-game guides/tutorials. There's been very little I've had to research on how to do because there wasn't enough instruction, really just driven by my own impatience and desire to complete collections. There's a lot about this game I still don't know about, even 110 hours into it. The seasoned players I read online and especially coming into this game during a new feature called \"Home Tours,\" WOW -- I had no idea how serious some Palia players have been the last 11 months of this game. You will see some people complaining about how there isn't enough to do or how there aren't enough updates or how the developers aren't pushing out enough content; but truthfully, a game that takes 80 hours to complete for a normal person is pretty impressive content. A game that allows you to sink an additional 50+ hours into for just fun and skill building and side-quest completion is even more impressive. People who are criticizing a lack of \"stuff to do\" have just been over-saturating themselves with it and playing too long. Trust me..... there's so much to do..... so many bugs to catch, so many things to build, so many crops to grow, so many jams to make, so many fish to lure... so many, so many, so many things to do.",

      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-05)](https://steam/76561198191542663)\nDidn't like it. You might, I just don't.\n\nI had a lot of trouble getting the game to work. I had to go into my steam audio settings and ensure everything was set specifically to my headphones and mic(which most games just do on their own) or else the game would not load at all... then I had issues where my escape button stopped working and I had to force exit. After that, the game worked, but there's tons of audio stuttering... but, to be fair- my computer is an older one. However, I run Genshin at 60fps most of the time with no audio issues at all.\n\nI find the character designs to be a mixed bag. The player characters are serviceable- I was able to make one of my favorite OCs, but the hairstyle selection was still somewhat limited in terms of longer hair.\n\nThe NPCs are... very jarring? They're very cringe and cutesy, a bit, which... can be fine but they force you through tutorial after tutorial and it gets old really fast... there's lots of tutorial menus appearing on other tutorial menus and it just... does not stop for the first 30 to 40 minutes.\n\nI don't care for the character designs of the NPCs overall. They are just purple people with pointy ears, nothing else to them. That CAN work, but in this case it just feels random and strange... I don't feel immersed at all. There are lots of ways purple or blue elves could work; make their character designs super interesting, but they are all just random human-like people.\n\nThen there's the gameplay. Hunting and fishing are alright. Anything else... zzzzzzzzz. Very boring. The UI feels very unfinished, which for a game that's been out for a year... that's unacceptable.\n\nClimbing is buggy and messy. You'll often clip into things. There's not a lot of people, those that are there don't really talk much. Except the NPCs. They don't shut up :)",

They all provide a more unique and detailed experience in their respective areas.\n\nFrom what I remember in testing - you're basically handed a plot of land at the beginning after some quests and you can start building/questing to progress. But these plots of land were away from the main village tucked away and I thought it was an instanced zone you could see with others so they could recycle the same handful of plots.\n\nAnd at that point why not play Valheim or V Rising or Palworld or something where you can build anywhere, see roughly the same number of real players or none at all if you prefer solo.\n\nPalia felt restrictive. If the goal was to move away entirely from pvp and combat more generally... you had to have had more freedom for players to build solo, build together to make a village, a town, a city.\n\nAnd I think Palia is kind of falling into that pitfall of assuming players will group up and make content on their own for pve. A tiny minority will. Pvp games the competition is the content. But pve you need to find a way to get people to work towards a common goal.\n\nAnyways just my rambling thoughts as someone who was optimistic, tried it out and got turned off. Sucks people are getting fired. Wish them well.\n\n### Comment ID kyns6av with +24 score by [(No_Dig903, Reddit, 2024-04-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1bz2e0z/palia_developers_singularity_6_axes_35_of_staff/kyns6av/) (in reply to ID kyn4d7g):\nMate, former \\*big company\\* generally means they're slaves to gridlock, whether or not they know it.\n\nWhat you want is some scrappy bastard from a small MMO studio that had to wear a lot of hats.

I struggle with a lot of crafting and survival game because I can never remember the resources I need, and I always feel like I'm falling behind. I'm into a lot of high-execution games... but open world survival games generally just leave me feeling mentally exhausted.\n\nThe limited resources and the generally simple routes to obtain them is something that my broken brain can handle without feeling overwhelmed.\n\nMany of the criticisms against Palia made hard are entirely valid.

I played for about a month or two when it went to open beta\n\nThe studio doesn't seem to know what it's doing or they're just trying to go after whales. They made it clear that you will *never* be able to unlock new outfits with out paying real life money for it despite having a clothing shop in game...which just brought you to the cash shop...\n\nWhen I played the game only had two tiny maps you could run around. The gameplay loop of the game gets old really fast.\n\nThere's no trading between players other than a goofy gifting system where you can give people stuff exchange for 1 point of something you need 100 of to do anything with, which you can get more of talking to the NPC's.\n\nThe game should have been $20, single player, with a focus on the story since that's exactly how it plays. You talk to the NPCs and can romance some of them or all of them and do their personal story as well as a main quest/storyline. There's literally no reason for this game to be online only other than the fact that they want to sell you $30 outfits with extremely limited colors.\n\nAnd as for the time i was playing the only way to get a pet was to spend a bunch of money in the cash shop.\n\nThe people who made the story and characters are talented.

You were supposed to be able to just walk over to their house and help them with their crops, cook with or for them and go on expedition type adventures without combat with them. I was incredibly hyped about it and let down even harder once I got into the closed Beta. No neighbourhoods, no exciting cooking or farming and the adventures where apparently axed from the roadmap in absolute silence. Instead we got a barely working, hardly running over 15 fps, loadingscreen simulator that looked like a 2012 phone game with some of the worst animations I‘ve ever seen. \n\nNot to mention the insane lack of any content really. It was okay-ish for a beta but it had no business being 50gb for what it is either. They didn’t even show you how big the game was back then, only said „This is your download speed“ with a bar that slowly filled up. \n\nOverall a absolute disappointment for anyone who’s been following the game since its announcement back in like 2018(?).\n\n### Comment ID lhjvama with +1 score by [(toocynicaltocare, Reddit, 2024-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1bz2e0z/palia_developers_singularity_6_axes_35_of_staff/lhjvama/) (in reply to ID kypy7zu):\nWhere the fuck is THAT game!

The game's foundations are 100% amazing. The mining, the hunting, the way you can place furniture and items, even the character designs are great. The issue is the game is lacking that cozy game grind and locked to a central server for absolutely no reason. There is no reason at all Palia is a MMO. You can't even see other players on your farm/housing plot unless you invite them. \n\nHonestly if anything the MMO aspects ruin the game. When you get to late game (which isn't hard I played the  game on and off super casually and got there very quickly) the only way to get rare wood is waiting for a event where certain trees glow and you need other players to help chop them down because they regenerate health. The issue is the playerbase would absolutely be insufferable about this event either you waited too long or you didn't wait long enough and you are a \"selfish spoiled gamer nice community palia REPORTED.\"Even now the subreddit has hissy fits with each other over this event about proper etiquette. To get rare ore you need to find certain spots and hope they respawn and then either take it or tag it like a MMO mob and wait for other players to tag the ore so everyone gets some. \n\nAlso on top of all that the game really doesn't have any huge updates since it launched in EA last year.  The fact you still can't tame animals is insane to me because cooking is super important and you will always be running to get milk and eggs while we see chickens and cow like creatures in the game itself. \n\nI never saw a game so mismanaged from top to bottom. I legit think if the game was built from the ground up as a single player game with co-op and they added more things to do (taming animals, exploring, more ores, more trees, less grinding your level to get some  cosmetics) it would have been a huge success. Also I didn't even mention their microtransactions don't bother with them they are just costumes or skin swaps for your glider and are massively over priced $30 for a skin is insane especially since there is little to do with the community besides the wood event.\n\n## Comment ID kyqoaxk with +3 score by [(Slaghton, Reddit, 2024-04-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1bz2e0z/palia_developers_singularity_6_axes_35_of_staff/kyqoaxk/) (in reply to ID 1bz2e0z):\nPretty sure they received more than enough money to finish the game but likely squandered it somehow.

For a life Sim it lacks basic features, the decorating is nice but you can hardly interact with anything. Especially in town.

They could have done a neighborhood like xiv so you can at least see some other houses without having to ask to be invited. \n\nThere is a clothing shop but it only sells clothes for premium currency, all \"basic\" clothes are just unlocked from the start. The shop is basically purely cosmetic as well since you just buy it from the store, from anywhere. \n\nThe character creator is pretty barebones as well, for a fully social game with no other real content besides rp.

It happens at Rockstar, it happens at BEhavior, it happens at Square, happens at Nintendo, etc. \n\nThey hire a larger staff than needed and then they lay off the extra developers so they can get paid before their next project. \n\nA small company like Singularity 6 that offers a *FREE* game can't keep paying extra people. So what they do is \"have a free vacation, see you in a few months when we need you again\". \n\nIt's absolutely normal and part of gaming development. \n\nSingularity now has to focus funds on boosting servers because they'll be working on a hard launch. \n\nGame developers are nomadic. Think of it as movie work, the film is over so everyone goes home. They lay them off so they can get unemployment for a while until they need to bring them back. \n\nThe people publishing these articles are basically shouting, \"Water is wet!\"\n\nSo don't stress about this, it's a normal cycle in video games. The lay off is a kindness so they'll make some money in-between jobs. \n\nMost of the time, they hire the same people back.\n\n### Comment ID l4dtecp with +13 score by [(Rainb0wTea, Reddit, 2024-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1ctgcw1/more_layoffs_at_s6_teams_down_to_a_few_dozen/l4dtecp/) (in reply to ID l4bu8de):\nWait Asherelle got laid off??

I hope not... \n\nThe only reason I don't think it's over is because they haven't made an attempt to actually monetize the game. They have a big enough dedicated player base that they could start monetizing more than just aesthetics in an attempt to be able to avoid the lay-offs. But they aren't. Which makes me think there's another reason for the lay-offs. \n\nThese could have been temporary positions that were created for the main creation of Palia, that have now run their course. It doesn't make it any less sad, but it would mean that Palia will continue on. It seems that they're laying off primarily art designers, which could just mean that they've completed the majority of the art design and no longer need that many people.... \n\nEven if S6 goes under entirely, I'd imagine that they'd sell the game to another developer. It's more than established enough at this point for other companies to be eyeballing it. It's also possible that they've already quietly sold it and haven't announced a merger to the public...\n\n#### Comment ID l4c6vqi with +51 score by [(atomicxblue, Reddit, 2024-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1ctgcw1/more_layoffs_at_s6_teams_down_to_a_few_dozen/l4c6vqi/) (in reply to ID l4c29x2):\nI'm surprised they're giving the game away for free.

It’s been frustrating, along with seeing a lot more little bugs all over the place than before. \n\nI will pay money for this game if it means they’ll keep the staff needed to help fix bugs and progress the game more! 😔\n\n## Comment ID l4emv40 with +35 score by [(magvadis, Reddit, 2024-05-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1ctgcw1/more_layoffs_at_s6_teams_down_to_a_few_dozen/l4emv40/) (in reply to ID 1ctgcw1):\nSeems like the cozy market is in the middle of a shakeup, Fae Farm staff also got a huge layoff.\n\nIm hoping this round of layoffs can keep them afloat but I also hoped the last would, it's a shame and I REALLY hope the work they have in the pipeline can see the light of day and this game make it to launch, it's still my main cozy game and its just about to get over that hump.\n\nThe infrastructure is there now, they just need a few holidays and another map or 2 and I think it'll go more viral. Hopefully they are making enough from the store to pay these 60 employees until they get over the hump and this is a long term decision.\n\nI don't want to be terrible and kick them while they are down, but I really feel like a lot of the issues are to do with this games clothing market.\n\n90% of the outfits are outlandish, what I've just been sitting here holding my wallet for are just basic cosmetics like a male straw hat (like Badruu's) or cloths closer to what npcs wear. Instead we get ninja outfits? My wallet just looks at all the clothing being offered and it's always just so over the top and not for me. I just want to feel like a part of Kilima and I just have so few outfits to choose from that fit that vibe.\n\nLike I have spent 30 bucks on this game...and I really couldn't tell you another outfit I'd buy that I didn't already. Every time I see a new outfit release it's 3 more outfits I would never wear or I couldn't really use pieces of. \n\nI really think they need to release some more down tempo outfits like \"farmer\" and \"fisherman\" and make them blend with other things. Like I spend how many hours fishing but I can't buy waders? No fisherman's hat? No straw hat in the entire game but there is one on Badruu's head? It's like, I'd buy all of these just to wear while I focused on one profession. Instead we get outfits....for being a ninja? In a game with ZERO combat? ZERO stealth? \n\nIts just sad it's the only way to support the game and I just have very little interest with what is on offer.\n\nI hope they can ride this lull and get out Elderwoods before it gets too bad.\n\nI really think if this game get get out another map or 2, 2-3 more yearly festivals, and some more housing building options, I REALLY think they have something special.\n\nAnd I don't say that about a lot of games.\n\n### Comment ID l4eo8f5 with +10 score by [(ImmaNotCrazy, Reddit, 2024-05-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1ctgcw1/more_layoffs_at_s6_teams_down_to_a_few_dozen/l4eo8f5/) (in reply to ID l4emv40):\nI agree with everything, especially the clothing.  I likely would own more if the pricing was better as there a few I do want but not for that much. One user commented that they prefer chasing whales as whale are more lucrative, yet that doesn't seem to be the case here.  Plus the removal of the MMO label makes it hard for a subscription type model you see on most MMOs...So, I hope they can think of something to help fill their coffers.  There is a lot of potential here, and I want to keep experiancing the world they started creating.

WHAT IM DOING. If I plan to go fishing? I put on shoes that look like I could get them wet. If I plan to go hunting? Guess what, it's something with some leather that makes me feel like a hunter.\n\nBut they just don't.\n\nThey keep going for these big ticket high input glowing items...but yet I have nothing to wear while Im fishing? The only chef outfit is just a meme it would be embarassing to wear that as a chef in public. There is one gardening outfit and it's like the kind a doll would wear. Meanwhile Badruu is just in a white tee with overalls and I'd wear that in a heartbeat.\n\nIt just feels like they don't really understand their market and instead of selling us \"Stardew Valley\" cloths or \"cute small town cloths\" we are getting ninja outfits and high tech outfits and a bunch of things that aren't even in the games lore as far as we know.\n\nSure you'll catch the occasional whale with a ninja fetish but you aren't going to catch the MAJORITY of your audience which is just people who want to do the professions the game offers.\n\n#### Comment ID l4ewe9a with +3 score by [(sensual_turtleneck, Reddit, 2024-05-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1ctgcw1/more_layoffs_at_s6_teams_down_to_a_few_dozen/l4ewe9a/) (in reply to ID l4eo8f5):\nfor real that one weird dress with the odd looking wig that came attached?

We were all falling all over each other to support them. But then they did the weird underhanded currency thing, the cleansing of reddit and discord, and after staying away I finally came back to find a TOOOOON of cash shop stuff and almost as many glitches as when I left after Beta took off.\n\nI’m disappointed because there is just so much to love about this game. Let this be a lesson to all you other developers out there: Make the game to be played, not just to get paid. The reason FFXIV works so well despite the monthly premium AND cash shop is because the team behind the game put the players first. Always. (except for Viera hats but we don’t talk about that) Loyalty comes when the community knows you see them as fellow gamers, not cash cows. \n\nYou might be able to turn it around now if you put a monthly premium in place, release the cash shop outfits and pets to be part of the game, and focus only on fixing bugs, not cash shop items.

My main goal in sharing this information is simply to keep everyone informed. That being said, there are some signs worth noting.\n\nWhile the current wave of layoffs seems to be happening uniformly and likely in relation to the completion of development work, the speed and timing of these cutbacks suggest there are no long-term plans for significant future development. Layoffs of this nature typically occur when a game is almost finished and transitioning to maintenance mode.\n\nUnless the promised updates are the last of them, relying on reused assets can only sustain future development for so long. Although they could rehire at a later date, it still indicates a lack of current plans. This winding down at this stage is unusual and likely related to financial constraints. If they are tightening the belt for financial reasons, it does not bode well for future development.\n\nHowever, as I also mentioned in my other replies, we won't know for sure unless they communicate directly with us. Right now, we have promises. If those promises are kept, great.

That alone will bump their sales. Additionally they can implement seasonal only items or promo purchasable items that players can buy in a small period of time. Theres also the option to create an outfit customizer that-allows you to say, pay 1$ more for the blue option of the sunglasses that cost 1.50$. If they broke up a 30$ outfit into 3-5 separate purchasable pieces I think they would see more new players spend money.\n\n## Comment ID l4ed5ak with +5 score by [(ItheraelCross, Reddit, 2024-05-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1ctgcw1/more_layoffs_at_s6_teams_down_to_a_few_dozen/l4ed5ak/) (in reply to ID 1ctgcw1):\nDoes anyone know how I can continue to follow Asherelle, or if she has social media anywhere?

I have bought over $300 of clothing but I doubt I'm the norm. Prior to the influx of Switch and Steam players, most everyone I saw had premium clothing on.. that is not the case any longer.

My wife and I just started playing and love it a lot. We both have 20-40 hours into it so far, and the biggest issue is how expensive the few purchasable items are. They have a lot to accomplish to make the game more welcoming to people, but they also need to readjust the store, add more items, and have a better fixed spending point. I'm not spending $34 for skins and a pet. Id spend $10 immediately. But not $34. \n\nAs someone who's played MMOs a lot of my life, it always baffles me how with all the success and loss history devs can look at over the hundreds of MMOs, why not take the best and implement it into a game? \n\nDo a season pass like halo mcc. Always accessible, you can go back and get items from it at ANY time. \n\nIn house or out source art for skins that cost $5-10 each. Make them appealing enough to want, but not over spend time and money to create. This will allow players to not feel bad about $$ and still support the game. \n\n\n\nI hope the game doesn't tank, though.

In some cases this can be normal as the larger part of development winds down, they may be in a comfortable place and not need all those people. If the artist have done their work and assets are stored, and everything is good. Then this may be ok. \n\nOr it maybe a publisher clearing house for profit and not caring about the actual game. If they expected large profits from their cosmetic shop and are not getting it, could be a reason to start tightening the belt.  If they did not expect a profit yet at this point, and it is just normal progression of time and layoff..we will be ok.

It's gone on to do just fine, and had continued to have a cash shop of cosmetics that don't affect gameplay.

The problem with Palia lies with priorities. Many systems are unrealized and unpolished compared to other games like it (from much smaller studios) yet the cash shop is already up an functioning. It also begs the question, what are their motivations for doing things the way they do them? Is making the game online in itself done just to sell more cosmetics? Are they going to forgo a more interactive pet system in lieu of one where they can sell cosmetic only pets?  \n\n \\- In a game with such few systems cosmetics play a much larger role in motivating a player. The fact that it's open beta only makes the emphasis on MTX items that much more glaring of a problem (because there's basically nothing to work for at some point).\n\n#### Comment ID jwgi277 with +3 score by [(hyrle, Reddit, 2023-08-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwgi277/) (in reply to ID jwg9fhv):\nWhen Fortnite was in beta, it wasn't a finalized product, though.  It had far fewer features than it has now.  It didn't have several of the systems it has now.  It had far fewer game modes.  In fact, it spent years in beta.\n\nI get the concerns over lack of content in Palia.  I even get concerns about cosmetics costing more than people want to pay (let's face it... any price over $0 is going to be more than some people want to pay.)  But it must be remembered this is a recently-opened live service game that's in beta and shouldn't be critiqued as if it's a complete game.  Even the fully-launched Fortnite continues to evolve, and I'm certain Palia will as long as it is profitable enough to keep it going.    And if it's not profitable, then like hundreds of live service games before it, then it'll close shop as so many F2P games have done before.\n\nIt's understandable that some might not like the direction of that evolution - and it's fair to critique that - but I'm just saying the expectations for a beta should be far lower.\n\n### Comment ID jwgxycg with +2 score by [(MeVe90, Reddit, 2023-08-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwgxycg/) (in reply to ID jwg4lqm):\nI'm surprised they didn't launch a battle pass yet\n\n## Comment ID jwik56a with +6 score by [(Eggsysmistress, Reddit, 2023-08-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwik56a/) (in reply to ID 15ss9gg):\ni thought they were an indie studio at first and was like “aww what a cute game. i’m sure they’ll work hard to make it better”. \n\npfft.\n\n## Comment ID jwjkx17 with +3 score by [(magvadis, Reddit, 2023-08-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwjkx17/) (in reply to ID 15ss9gg):\nIndie has to due with being owned by a major game company. \n\nOne 50 million dollar game does not make you major...at all.\n\n### Comment ID jwjlwc7 with +2 score by [(PsyTripper, Reddit, 2023-08-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwjlwc7/) (in reply to ID jwjkx17):\nThanks for clearing that up.

And they also have their own platforms.\n\nA better example to illutrate your point would have been CDProjekt Red.\n\nI guess my point would be that there are big indie studios, and small indie studios, both as independant as can be, but with wildly varying resources. Singularity 6 is a big indie studio. But still indie nonetheless.\n\n## Comment ID jwhxn1d with +3 score by [(Ezone35482, Reddit, 2023-08-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwhxn1d/) (in reply to ID 15ss9gg):\nI’m enjoying the game. lol.

I haven't been able to find a solid answer to this so if anyone has a source I'm genuinely curious.

It was basicaly Sci-Fi Warcraft, but it didn’t feel as “WoW clone” at all. The World Building was on point and it was all funny and jokes most of the time, but very serious when an important story archs happened. Just a perfect way how to tell a story imho.\n\nGameplay-wise it had everything what you wanted from an OG theme park mmorpg, but in a modern coat. Dungeons, raids, pvp bgs and arenas, ranked modes, awesome housing system, the list goes on. The best part? It released with all of that stuff. No “alpha” bullshit. Except for bugs and tuning, it just felt finished on the release day.\n\nMany people will disagree with me, but it was THE mmorpg for me. I played from start to shut-down and I wish I re-lived it again. My only real problems with the game was the simplified gearing system ( just 1 weapon per class ) and the telegraph spell system just wasn’t right in large scale battles ( most of the ground were just green and red circles and you couldn’t see anything in battlegrounds for example.)\n\n#### Comment ID lbb6bbq with +2 score by [(PersistentWorld, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbb6bbq/) (in reply to ID lbb1yz9):\nBest classes, housing combat and artstyle of any MMO ever\n\n\n\n#### Comment ID lbbi53k with +1 score by [(Concurrency_Bugs, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbbi53k/) (in reply to ID lbb1yz9):\nYou had player housing, and you could craft and place DUNGEONS on your plot of land.

Especially something like EQ, which doesn't necessarily have the highest player count, but something like 80% of all players subscribe, which is an incredible conversion rate for any game.\n\nThey also have stuff like DCUO, LOTRO (at a time when there's a lot of LotR media coming out) and DDO (at a time when D&D is really popular).\n\nPlus, like MassivelyOP pointed out once, all Daybreak games have essentially paid off their initial development costs and are running with super small teams. A dev for LOTRO has said that he's doing stuff solo that used to require six devs in the Turbine days, thanks to more efficient tools and content pipelines.\n\nSo I think Daybreak in particular has just really turned all their companies into lean operations with solid profit margins.\n\n#### Comment ID lbf6cju with +1 score by [(Vanrax, Reddit, 2024-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbf6cju/) (in reply to ID lbem1yc):\nPretty much.

      "# Post ID 15sufww: [REPOST] OPEN UP YOUR EYES with +268 score by [(ArrynMythey, Reddit, 2023-08-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15sufww/repost_open_up_your_eyes/)\nFew days ago I posted this to spread awareness and open up your eyes that Singularity 6 is not a small studio with a small budget. Also it explained what the beta testing is.\n\nThe post was removed for breaking the rule 3 as many of you noticed and I was banned. I had a discussion with u/I_Am_Batgirl to settle this. The post break the rule 3 because I edited it and added a link to a website that contained list of the Singularity 6 employees (their names to be precise). Though this was a public information we discussed why it is not a good idea to post it here and came to an agreement.\n\nThe ban was lifted. So here's the original post (without the link to that problematic list) + some more thoughts at the bottom regarding the current situation with the latest patch.\n___\nI was reading lots of post, positive and negative ones. And I think there are few things that must be said.\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nDevs are not begginers.\n\n\n>Today, our team includes top talent with experience at big studios like Blizzard Entertainment, Epic Games, and Riot Games; among others.\n\n\n[link](https://www.singularity6.com/news/we-are-singularity-6)\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nThe Singularity 6 company is not as small as you think.\n\n\n>Singularity 6 has 169 Employees\n\n\n[link](https://growjo.com/company/Singularity_6#company-overview)\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nThe budget for this game is really big.\nEDIT: For better perspective read the top comment below, from u/SyleSpawn\n\n\n>Singularity 6, the developer of the the MMO Palia that has echoes of Animal Crossing and Breath of the Wild, has raised $30 million in Series B funding to help fuel the development of that title.\n\n\n[link](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palia-dev-raises-30-million-to-support-the-mmo/1100-6493473/)\n\n\n(this was in 2021, today the budget was said to be around 50 millions)\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nBeta testing - there shouldn't be much of a missing content. It is testing before release and its goal is to test whether everything works as intended. It's also servers stress test.\n\n\n>A beta phase generally begins when the software is feature complete but likely to contain several known or unknown bugs.[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#cite_note-8) Software in the beta phase will generally have many more bugs in it than completed software and speed or performance issues, and may still cause crashes or data loss. The focus of beta testing is reducing impacts on users, often incorporating [usability testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability_testing).\n\n\n[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Beta)\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nThis said the game is in a horrible state. There are missing features and content. It is not what it was advertised as. It is not an MMO, it is a singleplayer game with shared world.\n\n\nThe attitude that these devs cannot do wrong is toxic and will make the game flop. If they will lock themselves up in an echo chamber they will not change anything thinking this game's a masterpiece.\n\n\nDon't settle for low standards. If you are satisfied with crap, you will eat crap. Push them to make the change. You want this game to succeed. How can this game succeed when the feedback is mostly negative?\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nYou can enjoy the game and I am not disregarding your fun you have with this game. Still you should be able to recognize that this game has severe problems.\n\n\nI mean saying \"it is a bad game\" and \"I'm having fun\" are not mutually exclusive. At least that's the mindset I'm trying to push.\n\n___\n\nThe latest patch that added only few items to the game and more items and pets to the cash shop proved what this studio (not devs only, the whole studio) really is. Their priorities are milking the playerbase and not making the game they promised.\n\nThe release date knocks on the door and the game is lacking so much - from basic features to missing content.\n\nIf nothing changes with the game's official release, this game will die a slow death.\n\nThis raises the question - is there a something that we can do?\n\nIn my opinion the only way how to get the game that was promised to us is to try to notify the devs and push them to be transparent with their roadmap. They must show us what their priorities are and stick to them. They destroyed the trust of many of us. We must be loud and they must listen.\n\nThe word will spread. If nothing changes... We know how this ends.\n\n## Comment ID jwg8moh with +146 score by [(SyleSpawn, Reddit, 2023-08-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15sufww/repost_open_up_your_eyes/jwg8moh/) (in reply to ID 15sufww):\nI would like to further add one point to your post so that people understand what kind of funding the dev received.

Sorry.  Knowing someone in the industry, this is incredibly off base.  Are they paying people out of this?    Unless they are getting paid nothing, there is no effing way haha.  And I’m only speaking to the triple A games you listed.  \n\nHorizon said over 47 million.  Didn’t give an exact cost.  And the second one was over 200 million?  And they even had the assets to work with.\n\nSekiro has 1000 people in the credits.  Maybe not all of them were paid but the engineers alone would be getting paid nothing in comparison to other companies if the game took 5 years to make.  \n\nMost successful game companies are paying way over that so I don’t know.  \n\nThe issue is most companies won’t tell you exactly what it costs to make their games.  Not exactly.  Palia unfortunately didn’t have that luxury for whatever reason.\n\nPalia is shit but 50 million over 5 years is not a lot of money.  Sure they could have done better and we should expect more, but game development is incredibly expensive.\n\nEDIT: And just to clarify, I DO think they could have done better but it honestly comes down to lack of ideas.

Hell no, especially considering, that most of them don't even earn a whole lot or profit from the monetization himself. That's like blaming one of Nestle's Secretary's for the evil the firm is doing.\n\nThere should have never been any trust to begin with. With majority foreign investors, all that matters is the bottom line. They do not have any connection to the game, they do not have any reputation to consider and they do not have an IP/Brand that would suffer from exploitative monetization or shipping a half ass-ed product.\n\nThat doesn't mean that the Devs are completely innocent.

Not like they were remotely rushed, 5 years of development time and plenty of money. This isn't like they only had 2 years then investor suddenly was like you need to release this now so we can see money return.\n\nIts been 5 years, they had plenty of time to create heck a lot more than what's there now. The fact they have to release it in this state is completely on them. They knew what they were getting into when they got those investment. They were the ones who sold the game and probably a delivery time line to the investors. They were the one who couldn't keep that promise.\n\nEven if the investors were forcing them to release early the current state does not match what you expect out of the time, money, and man power put in.

However,\n\nLet's start with probably the most simple thing. The game was releases **early.** That's indicative of the development fund not being fully utilized. That's the whole point of releasing something early. To generate return on investment before the development is done. There could easily be the last 10 Million lying around.\n\nThinking of \"The Devs\" of a hedgemonious group is stupid to begin with. The Dev team grew by almost 90% last year. With the same growth rate in the year before. Looking at the current employee number and inferring what they should have created retroactively is beyond idiotic. Especially in a new studio, newly formed team that literally doubled in size multiple times over the last 3-4 years. Anybody who worked in the corporate world knows (especially those that have worked in IT), that most new hires produce a net negative in progress for the first X Months within a studio (aka eating more time than they actually spend in a useful manner).\n\nI said it before, i say it again. Anybody who \"put trust into the game\" and expected anything other than we have received was an idiot. A royal one.\n\nThis is exactly what anybody should have expected.

Working for big game studios doesn't mean as much as you think.  If they were just junior devs they didn't make any decisions and just did what they were told to.  For all we know most of them worked just on UI.  I would say they are beginners to making a full game but being beginners isn't an excuse people should be using anyway.\n2. We don't really know how many FT permanent employees they have.  You can pull up numbers from many websites but those numbers will most likely include contractors who just did temporary work like VO or concept art.\n3. The budget part is interesting to be honest but I can't make a judgement on the money situation unless I see financial statements.  Maybe they're actually a company that pays their employees really well and gives great benefits.  If they pay 10 employees 100k a year that's 1 million USD just for those employees wages for one year and if they really have over 100 full time perminent employees they could be spending upwards of 10M a year on wages and benefits.  The point is that 50M doesn't go that far in this economy.  Especially when that's what's made over 5 years.  \n4. Many, many games go into beta (even release) missing secondary features like FFXIV 2.0 for example.  I'm willing to give them a bit of a break on this.  Mostly because the NPC content currently in the game is massive even if the story and map isn't.  \n\nHonestly I think what we should push for is public financial statements more than a roadmap.  Singularity 6 isn't publicly traded so public financial statements aren't required but I think it would do good for the community to see them.\n\nThat being said I was disappointed in the patch yesterday but I personally realize it's only been 2 weeks since Closed Beta launch and not even a week since Open Beta started.  I'm personally going to give them some more time because they can't just shift what they were doing suddenly based on feedback.  Changes take time.  Coding/development takes time.\n\n### Comment ID jwh2jip with +14 score by [(Zyntastic, Reddit, 2023-08-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15sufww/repost_open_up_your_eyes/jwh2jip/) (in reply to ID jwh0fwj):\nThese devs are not beginners by any means. \n\nThe studio threw around big names like former Blizzard and riot employees and what not like they're a hot commodity to wear. \n\nOf course that budget gets spent mostly on paying the employees, but it begs the question, even if they were paid really well, WHAT have they been doing with all their time at work for the past 5 years that justifies these wages/salaries. That's what it boils down to. \nBecause right now it seems like they got paid insane wages to sit around for 5 years and put together an entry level project. You really can't ignore how barebones this is. It's an alpha that just has a beta tag sticker slapped on it.\n\n#### Comment ID jwhbns5 with +7 score by [(rosemarygirl2456, Reddit, 2023-08-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15sufww/repost_open_up_your_eyes/jwhbns5/) (in reply to ID jwh2jip):\nPeople pad their resumes all the time.  Also 50 million seems like a lot but is kind of ass in the tech industry if you actually divide that by number of employees over 5 years.  Most devs would make much more working at other companies, just wouldn’t have the benefit of possibly making bank individually off of a successful game.\n\nAll that to say, I think the game is not in a good state and there is a possibility they are scrambling.  Only reason they would make such a bad decision releasing this, calling it beta and STILL releasing it on switch by the end of the year.  They overshot and now they need a plan B.\n\n#### Comment ID jwhb40v with +1 score by [(blooddrinkr7, Reddit, 2023-08-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15sufww/repost_open_up_your_eyes/jwhb40v/) (in reply to ID jwh2jip):\nHow do you know?  Like I said they could have just been junior devs doing a small part of the UI.  Of course they threw around their previous jobs at big name places.  That's how you get funding.\n\nWell they didn't have that big budget for 5 years.  They raised $2.5M in 2018, $16.5M in 2019 (which is when they started Palia and probably started doing some hiring), and then $30M in 2021 (which is probably when they started doing even more hiring).  They also needed to start from the ground up with hardware, software, legal representation, probably office space before the pandemic, etc.  \n\nI honestly don't think it's bare bones.  Would I like more quests and areas?  Of course.  But there is a lot of content other than that.  Building and decorating your house is a huge amount of content.  As is NPC interaction.  Many times I see people say there's no content but it's clear they don't do either of those things and don't care about them much.  Of course it seems bare bones if you don't do the two biggest parts of the game content.\n\n### Comment ID jwh2bwp with +8 score by [(ArrynMythey, Reddit, 2023-08-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15sufww/repost_open_up_your_eyes/jwh2bwp/) (in reply to ID jwh0fwj):\nInteresting points. I will explain what I meant with my statements.\n\n1. The excuse I see the most is that all the devs are beginners. Many of them probably are ones but they are lead by experienced people.\n2. People often called them an indie studio in a way they are small. Yes, they are independent, but not small.\n3. Compare this to the games in the top rated comment here (the one I awarded). If they really pay that well for doing barely nothing I will gladly join them.\n4. Release date is close, I don't think they will change much. Especially when you see the official list of known issues (I made a post about it, check my profile).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPublic financial statements is really great idea. We need more transparency in general. Although I don't think they will give us these statements since we are not investors and could show the company in a bad light.\n\n#### Comment ID jwh8z3y with +3 score by [(blooddrinkr7, Reddit, 2023-08-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15sufww/repost_open_up_your_eyes/jwh8z3y/) (in reply to ID jwh2bwp):\n1. Depends on how experienced.  I would say that a new studio should be given more leniency than an old one with many releases no matter who the leads are but still less leniency than a studio of only non experienced personnel.  \n2. I think it's an issue with the definition of indie.  Some will use indie to mean not a major studio with many games under their belt will some will use it to mean only small studios that fit that criteria.  It's the same in music.  I think the semantics of indie, and MMO, decrease the legitimacy of feedback though.  And I mean that for \"both sides\".  \n3. Those games were all backed by large studios.  There's more to a company than just money.  Like did those budgets include the need to pay for hardware?  Or on-boarding?  What about legal representation?  This is why I think financial statements are a good idea.\n4. Eh.  I think release will be December and I don't see that as close.  They also are talking about having content patches every two weeks with bug fixes in-between.  I have cautious hope but if that hope is sustained will depend on the next patch.  It died a bit with the patch yesterday since it was so small.\n\nAgreed that we need more transparancy.  I like the transparency we've had about feedback.  It shows that most of the devs probably don't even know the community feedback yet since the Community Management Team is making spreadsheets and powerpoints as well as trying to moderate.  I actually feel kinda bad for them.  They've got a lot on their plate.\n\nIt could also show them in a good light.  Though honestly, lots of people don't understand financials of business (I only know a bit due to a college class if I'm honest) and they could probably be misread.  It might open a can of worms.\n\n### Comment ID jwi7oeh with +1 score by [(_wolfmuse, Reddit, 2023-08-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15sufww/repost_open_up_your_eyes/jwi7oeh/) (in reply to ID jwh0fwj):\nCould COVID have impacted their development cycle as well?\n\n#### Comment ID jwihytq with +7 score by [(RexZShadow, Reddit, 2023-08-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15sufww/repost_open_up_your_eyes/jwihytq/) (in reply to ID jwi7oeh):\nIt effected everyone to a degree, although game development like most of the tech is easily able to work around it given the nature of how everything works.

Is that the budget for the game itself or does it include the budget for establishing the studio legally as a business, leasing office spaces, buying equipment, hiring employees, and other start up costs? I haven't been able to find a solid answer to this so if anyone has a source I'm genuinely curious. I keep seeing people compare them to other studios, but it's always studios that are already established and (I would assume) don't need as much overhead.

Personally my biggest issue with the game is the cash shop (premium currency that doesn't match up with IRL currency) everything else seems ok right now and I have hope that it will improve.

What I and many others have as an issue with the cash shop in Palia is because of this statement of yours actually....\n\n>Beta testing I agree on, they're really should be more to this game, especially after find your shepp. At this point they might run out of players before the full set of features are a thing?\n\nThe cash shop and their item prices DO NOT match the game's current state. This is beta. We are supposed to be testing their shit, not buying items (unless it is done to, again, test things and provide feedback. In which case, the currency should be given for free so players are able to test their cash shop features without having to actually pay real money). \n\nThe game being free to play isn't the main concern here. It's because the game doesn't have much to show for but they're wanting you to pay $30-$60 for cosmetic items. This also extends into the topic of trust. Which is important for people to enjoy their game and to continue supporting it. Currently, their monetization feels predatory partly because of how closely it feels to all those other instances of games whose sole existence was to become a cash grab. It's a reasonable worry as it happens pretty often, and the studio needed to focus on building their playerbase's trust. Not to play fire with one of the major things that have been causing people's loss of confidence.\n\n#### Comment ID jwioopo with +3 score by [(ScorchTT, Reddit, 2023-08-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15sufww/repost_open_up_your_eyes/jwioopo/) (in reply to ID jwily5r):\n> Cash shops may automatically sour some people's moods but in general, it doesn't have this much of a negative effect IF the game actually feels complete, has the basic features they promised, and has either quantity or quality (or both!) to their existing content.

The seniors/leads are very kind and patient in explaining technicalities and they make sure you understand the reason for things to work the way they do. \n\nIf you want to learn and grow in your discipline, S6 is the place to do it. Not to mention you'll get to work on some amazing content!\n\nThe best part of it all, in my opinion, is the team dynamics. Being a skilled professional is important, but couple that with a great personality and you have the perfect colleagues. I did not meet a single employee at S6 that did not fit this bill.",

Some folks became ill from overwork.\n\nLeadership had and still has very little diversity, which is painfully noticeable in the type of decisions taken.\n\nTeam structuring creates massive silo-ing and strong \"our team vs. yours\" in terms of output.

ICs who provide feedback have the feedback turned around and weaponized against them in performance reviews or elsewhere. The company is packed full of very talented ICs who are deprived of the support they need to succeed, and then blamed and take punishment when things don't go the way leadership wants them to. \r\n\r\n\r\n- Dishonesty and deceit is rampant in communication to employees. Never have I seen such a level of dishonest behavior from leadership, especially at such a small company. I can understand a need to be careful on what information to be transparent with, but the leadership very frequently, intentionally, and blatantly lies to everyone at the company about the state of the company. The sad part is that these lies are very shallow and most people see through them, but they serve their short-sighted purpose of keeping the illusion of the \"everything is fine\" dog. One example is telling everyone there will only be a few weeks of \"targeted overtime, not crunch\", knowing full well that it would last indefinitely for many.\r\n\r\n - Diversity problems explicitly ignored by leadership because it's not a \"priority,\" despite the large human impact of them. The company made big promises around D&amp;I to employees, and has failed to live up to them. And recently things have gotten much worse. \r\n\r\nThere are many other problems I did not list here. I fear that many more good people at the company will be hurt by the reckless course management is taking the company.",

Then had a personal disagreement with engineering leadership on topics they know are problematic in the company during a 1:1 and, the very next week, they fired me.\r\nThey also originally hid that it was a firing when they shared with the rest of the company until enough people reached out to me and learned otherwise. Then they edited the Slack message announcing my departure.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, I am not saying leadership failed by firing me. Sometimes firings are the best move (though, I do not personally think that is true in my case, you don't know). I am noting that why it happened, how it happened, and what things occurred and did not occur are all serious concerns for the company going forward.

While S6 has done a remarkable job, particularly during a pandemic, at staying connected, we struggle with projects that require multiple-team coordination. This challenge is also well known and discussed, making it possible to try to improve things rather than just accepting it as it is. While I enjoy the challenge of helping shape how an organization collaborates, if you're looking for well-defined and stable team responsibilities, S6 may not be right for you. \n* While we talk openly about the challenges of creating a diverse workforce in engineering game dev, we are having a difficult time making progress in this direction. While I believe, given our values and culture of respect, people from underrepresented groups would flourish here, we haven't demonstrated the ability to hire diverse candidates yet. Part of this can be attributed to a very senior staff, which skews both our network and our candidate pool, but we need to do better in this space than we are now. \n* While work-life balance is good, it does require self-discipline to balance your time. This project is really exciting and we have a lot of passionate and engaged people. This enthusiasm is contagious and if you're not experienced at holding yourself accountable to other commitments it can absorb a lot of time. The upside is everyone is aware of this and is thoroughly supportive (like I mentioned above) of your away from work. We're in this for the long run.",

While I enjoy the challenge of helping shape how an organization collaborates, if you're looking for well-defined and stable team responsibilities, S6 may not be right for you. \n* While we talk openly about the challenges of creating a diverse workforce in engineering game dev, we are having a difficult time making progress in this direction. While I believe, given our values and culture of respect, people from underrepresented groups would flourish here, we haven't demonstrated the ability to hire diverse candidates yet. Part of this can be attributed to a very senior staff, which skews both our network and our candidate pool, but we need to do better in this space than we are now. \n* While work-life balance is good, it does require self-discipline to balance your time. This project is really exciting and we have a lot of passionate and engaged people. This enthusiasm is contagious and if you're not experienced at holding yourself accountable to other commitments it can absorb a lot of time.

Never have I seen such a level of dishonest behavior from leadership, especially at such a small company. I can understand a need to be careful on what information to be transparent with, but the leadership very frequently, intentionally, and blatantly lies to everyone at the company about the state of the company. The sad part is that these lies are very shallow and most people see through them, but they serve their short-sighted purpose of keeping the illusion of the \"everything is fine\" dog. One example is telling everyone there will only be a few weeks of \"targeted overtime, not crunch\", knowing full well that it would last indefinitely for many.\r\n\r\n - Diversity problems explicitly ignored by leadership because it's not a \"priority,\" despite the large human impact of them. The company made big promises around D&amp;I to employees, and has failed to live up to them. And recently things have gotten much worse. \r\n\r\nThere are many other problems I did not list here.

      "# [Update: Palia studio Singularity 6 confirms 36 workers have been laid off by Danielle Riendeau on 2024-05-16](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-palia-studio-singularity-6-lays-off-36-employees)\nUpdate (05/17/24): Singularity 6 has told Game Developer it has laid off 36 staffers to navigate through a \"tough economic period.\" The studio said it will continue supporting Palia following the job cuts.\n\n\"Unfortunately we have had to restructure and reduce the size of our team as we stay focused on supporting Palia and serving our community long term. We had to let 36 of our colleagues go yesterday, in an effort to navigate this tough economic period,\" reads a statement issued by a company spokesperson.\n\n\"We thank our departing team for all their work; we are committed to providing the best assistance and transition we can. We hope the industry will provide homes for these talented colleagues.\"\n\nOriginal story: According to reporting by Polygon's Nicole Carpenter and Games Radar, Palia studio Singularity 6 has just laid off 36 workers, representing about 40 percent of its staff.\n\nThe news comes after the developer reportedly laid off 49 workers in April, with further staff allegedly leaving after that round as well. There was a smaller layoff last September, with an undisclosed number of developers affected.\n\nSingularity 6 has yet to comment on the layoff, though developers impacted have already started to speak out online via Linkedin. We've reached out to Singularity 6 for further information, and will update the story accordingly.\n\nPalia, which launched on Steam earlier this March, is currently Singularity 6's flagship title. The game is pitched as a \"cozy world made for you,\" with some obvious aesthetic similarities and gameplay features to the likes of Stardew Valley and the Animal Crossing series. It's currently free to play on Steam and Switch.\n\nAccording to a post on the developer's site in mid-March, there was strong interest in the game, including 600,000 playtest sign-ups, but it's difficult to say if that momentum carried far enough beyond launch (just over a week later, on March 25).\n\nSingularity 6 joins a terrible layoff week for the game industry",
      "# [Dev Blog: Looking Ahead](https://palia.com/news/dev-blog-looking-ahead)\nHowdy, Palians! We love that you all are enjoying your adventures in the whimsical world of Palia while taking the time to provide us with excellent and essential feedback. We’ve been busy behind the scenes, and it’s high time for us to give you all a sneak peek at what we’ve been working on!\n\nLet’s Get Creative\n\nSince debuting Home Tours in the Summer Serenade update, we’ve learned a few things:\n\nThe Palian community is incredibly talented and creative (although we already knew that!).\n\nMany of the community’s creations put our development team’s designs to shame, especially our Chief Chapaa Officer.\n\nPlayers love visiting new homes! Palians embarked on more than 1 million tours within the first 24 hours of the Home Tours feature’s launch!\n\nThese points confirm that your creativity is as important to you as it is to us! And we want to foster that creative spirit by making decorating, designing, and showcasing your home plot as seamless and fun as possible.\n\nWe’ve seen some useful feedback around Home Tour discoverability, and we’re working on a ‘featuring’ system that will place your home plot front and center to help your friends and other players find your awesome designs.\n\nThe team is also working incredibly hard to raise your plot's overall decor limits. However, there are some tough engineering challenges related to performance and stability; and we need to ensure that we’re delivering the best gameplay experience for all Palians.\n\nIf performance limitations weren’t an issue, we would place no limit on the number of decor assets you could place on your home plot. Unfortunately, we need some more time to consider bandwidth and optimize our gameplay that will give players even more creative freedom. Alas, while the current (and future!) decor limits are in place to ensure stability, the team is dedicating a whole lot of effort into reducing points of friction between the home plot and your creativity. We’ve been working hard to further improve performance as players maximize our 3,000 object/decor limit.\n\nWe’re making some meaningful changes that give Palians more crafting and design choices. Please read below for a brief overview:\n\nWe’ve created a new optimization system for decor, such as Building Blocks, that allows us to remove the individual Building Block limit. Now Building Blocks are inclusive of the overall 3,000 limit!\n\nSome other optimizations have allowed us to increase the limit for Flowers from 500 to a total of 1,000! So if you have a particularly green thumb and want to maximize your Flower placements, you will be able to host a total of 1,000 Flowers on your designed plot!\n\nWe’re making the decor limits visible in placement mode and from the housing menu to help you keep track of how close to the limit you are.\n\nPatch 0.183: Sunset Soiree\n\nSince we’re delivering all the dang spoilers, we might as well shed some light on planned content for the upcoming Sunset Soiree update (Patch 0.183). In addition to our home plot sub-limit changes, we’re including a much-requested quality-of-life feature that gives players the ability to seamlessly search for specific items in the player’s workbench and storage!\n\nWe’re also debuting Potato Pods! What are Potato Pods, and how do you get them? We’re planning an entire line of these sweet, tuber-ular, and spud-tacular collectable plushies. There will be a significant number of Potato Pods to collect, and you’ll have the opportunity to get a random Potato Pod periodically 🤫, adding an element of surprise to your collection.\n\nBut the best way to ensure you complete your collection will be to trade with your friends. That’s right – a trading system is planned for a future update (not currently planned for Patch 0.183), and the system will not be exclusive to Potato Pods! Stay tuned for more deets.\n\nAn Outfit for Every Member of the Pack\n\nAnd we’ve heard that many of you Palians would like to see more masculine-presenting outfits. You’ll go feral when we debut the Wild Howl outfit! Although, the outfit looks great on feminine–presenting body types as well, so no need to feel left out of the pack.\n\nIntroducing Elderwood\n\nOur well-known best kept secret is the development of our next Adventure Zone, Elderwood. Elderwood is an expansive, gorgeous, and potentially somewhat devious new zone set in the world of Palia that will challenge player’s conceptions of Flow, the Majiri, and the role humans play in the whimsical world of Palia. Elderwood will introduce new mainline quests, gameplay elements, and many hours of adventure for you and your friends to enjoy! While we’re incredibly excited about the possibilities for Elderwood, we don’t want to give away too much right now. In the meantime, check out some concept art below:\n\nAnd if you’re as excited as we are – we know that you’ll want to get in and explore Elderwood as soon as possible. But we’ll all need to wait a little bit longer, as we expect to ship Elderwood in early 2025.\n\nHowever, you all can expect several gameplay updates between now and Elderwood’s launch. These updates will focus on new gameplay features, in-game events (Maji Market?? 👀), experimental content, quality-of-life improvements, and… new quests! Our team is making it a priority to deliver as many new quests as we can that will appeal to both new players and stalwart Palians.\n\nWe know that you all want more gameplay content and new quests (especially as part of Palia’s evolving world story). And that content is coming! But of course, all new content will vary in size, especially as we continue building towards larger gameplay beats. A lot of thought and effort goes into each individual patch, especially the larger updates; and we want to make each update as meaningful and impactful as possible for the Palian community. Rest assured that we’re building towards these larger beats, such as the series of areas planned for Elderwood’s rollout. Stay tuned for a whole lot more!\n\nAs we continue expanding the world of Palia, you can expect to see a mix of content updates large and small… including the highly-anticipated conclusion to Palia’s Prologue quest. We’re also prioritizing bug fixes, feature improvements, and the overall questline player experience. Our goal is to make the best version of Palia we possibly can with each gameplay addition, new quest, quality-of-life improvement, or mechanical tweak as we ramp up toward the launch of Elderwood and beyond. In short – there will always be something new to discover.\n\nThank you for being a part of the Palia community. We appreciate your continued feedback and support as we continue shaping the game’s future. In the meantime, we’ll see you in-game.\n\nThank you,\n\nSingularity 6",
      "# [Singularity 6, Daybreak Game Company Cozy Up in Studio Acquisition](https://www.singularity6.com/news/studio-acquisition)\nThe Singularity 6 team has some exciting news to share that is bigger than Kaiju Frogbert (if you can believe that’s even possible!). As of today, we’re adding a new chapter to the S6 lore: Acquisition. Some folks can find reading this chapter to be scary. But it's far from it. Our team is absolutely thrilled to be joining forces with Daybreak Game Company, a subsidiary of Enad Global 7 AB (EG7), known for publishing and supporting some of the world’s most popular and successful online multiplayer franchises, such as EverQuest, H1Z1, The Lord of the Rings Online, and more.\n\nWith Daybreak’s extensive industry experience and pedigree, our studio’s potential for growth can be felt from the Kilima mountains to the shores of Bahari Bay. The acquisition provides us with some incredible resources and support to continue developing Palia and elevate the product to meet the gold standard that our players expect, including engaging new content, impactful social features, and quality-of-life improvements across the board.\n\nWhat makes this partnership even more special comes down to our unique partnership with Daybreak. It is incredibly exciting to find like-minded partners who share in our commitment to investing in our products and players for the long-term, and have a proven track record of building gaming communities that last for decades. While S6 will continue operating independently under the leadership of our Co-Founders Anthony Leung and Aidan Karabaich, the studio will receive invaluable support from Daybreak’s senior management, including CEO Ji Ham. It is safe to say that our studio’s vision and creative direction will remain intact as we continue developing experiences that forge alternate worlds that deepen players’ lives.\n\nSingularity 6 is buzzing with excitement, energy, and fresh ideas. This acquisition is not just a milestone; it’s a launchpad that will help drive the success of our studio, our marquee product Palia, and our future projects. With the expanded resources, we’ll continue investing in the development and exploration of new and innovative ideas in the online multiplayer cozy community sim genre, bringing Palia to its 1.0 launch, and ultimately getting Palia into the hands of every gamer that wants to play across all major platforms.\n\nStay tuned for more updates and prepare for an incredible journey as Singularity 6 and Daybreak continue collaborating to make Palia the coziest and most enjoyable online multiplayer game possible.",

      "# [Patch 0.177 Notes](https://palia.com/news/patch-177)\n📸Screenshot taken by TinyHydra\n\nIt’s Bug-Hunting Season!\n\nAs promised in our last dev update, this patch is dedicated to squashing a whole lotta bugs that have been reported to us by the players!

The remaining recipes can be unlocked through Inspiration.\n\nRummage Piles have been added to Bahari Bay.\n\nYou can discover items from the new Flotsam decor set (see below).\n\nThis also includes 13 new Found Item Quests that are exclusive to this area!\n\nFeatured Found Item: Hodari’s Grill! 🍖\n\nIt works just like the Campfire, but looks way spiffier.\n\nStyle your housing plot with the nautical-themed Flotsam decor set! 🐬\n\n11 items have been added:\n\nFlotsam Large Candle, Flotsam Small Candle, Flotsam Sand Art, Flotsam Driftwood Decor, Flotsam Towel Rack, Flotsam Bookshelf\n\nFlotsam Porthole Frame, Flotsam Hanging Mobile, Flotsam Scallop, Flotsam Conch, Flotsam Glass Buoy\n\nThese items can be obtained from newly added Rummage Piles—only in Bahari Bay!\n\nThe Pavilion is now purchasable at City Hall.\n\nGive your garden and outdoor area a ✨glow up✨ with this wonderful new building add-on!\n\nSeveral new wallpapers have been added to the game.\n\n12 new wallpapers have been added:\n\nMirthful Mosaic Wallpaper, Woven Barkcloth Wallpaper, Flowering Field Wallpaper, Painted Scroll Wallpaper, Vibrant Threads Wallpaper, Floral Felicity Wallpaper, Wading Hibiscus Wallpaper, Fanning Leaves Wallpaper, Simple Diamond Wallpaper, Noble Bloom Wallpaper, Spring Blossoms Wallpaper, Riveting Twines Wallpaper\n\nYou can purchase them at Tish’s store.\n\nAdjustments\n\nLuna New Year and the Maji Market have come to an end.\n\nThank you to everyone who participated in this second iteration of the Maji Market. Seeing all the positive reactions and fun everyone had (with the Hotpot mini-game especially!) has been an incredible experience. We fully intend to have the market return again, even bigger and better with all our learnings. Please look forward to more Events for Palians to enjoy.\n\nBok Choy Seeds, Napa Cabbage Seeds, and Soy Sauce are now purchasable at Zeki’s Store.\n\nWith the conclusion of Luna New Year, these crops are now accessible alongside other crops within Zeki’s Store.\n\n*Please note, this has always been the intention to make it available in the General Store following the end of Maji Market, but it was reported differently in the previous patch notes. It has since been corrected, and we apologize for the misunderstanding. *\n\nSeveral Dish Recipes introduced in Luna New Year are now accessible at Reth’s food counter in the Inn.\n\nThe following 6 Recipes are available: Steamed Fish, Pan Fried Dumplings, Spicy Crab Fried Rice, Kimchi Fried Rice, Cabbage Rolls, and Rice Cake Stir Fry\n\nWe’ve also added two accomplishments for cooking these dishes!\n\nYou can now go directly to Bahari Bay from your Housing Plot!\n\nSome folks might have noticed some new map additions we snuck in the last patch… well now it’s official! This shortcut will allow you to quickly access Bahari Bay, free of charge. 🏃\n\nMining nodes will now behave more like forageable items—once a node is cleared, it’ll remain available to other users and disappear after a set amount of time.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nAll players who participate in mining a node will get full loot participation. This behavior is the same as before.\n\nAfter it is looted, players who participated will see a ghosted version of the rock, indicating that it is available for others to acquire. Mining nodes that have been mined by other players will show an added glow effect, indicating that it was already mined by other players and will eventually despawn.\n\nMining nodes that are close to despawning will pulse more rapidly to indicate that the node is close to despawning\n\nThis change affects all mining nodes outside of the housing plot\n\n“We’ve been seeing how players react to Palium nodes, and understand how important it is that people don’t feel burdened into playing a specific way. With these changes, you can call out a node and move on without feeling pressured to wait for other players. This feedback has been very valuable to us, and we hope to continue improving things in a way that supports a variety of playstyles.” - S6 Forseti\n\nForageable items will now also have a “despawn” glow effect after being foraged on other players’ screens.\n\nWe’ve extended the duration flare arrows stay active to support the change to mining nodes.\n\nFlare arrows will now last up to 3 minutes.\n\n⚠️Note: Each player can still only have one active flare arrow at a time.\n\nThe Chatbox and Social Panel has been removed from the Lobby screen at the start of the game.\n\nPremium Store Updates\n\nFive New Outfit Bundles have been added to the Premium Store.\n\nFeatured Outfit: The Astronomer bundle(2550/Outfit - 5100/Bundle) includes Star Chart, Constellation, and Draco outfits.\n\nEach outfit comes with a face mask, top and bottom.\n\nEquipping the top will have starry-themed effects appear when you idle!\n\nThe Cottage Witch bundle (2550/Outfit - 5100/Bundle) includes Nettle Scone, Toadstool Tartlet, and Foxglove Cake outfits.\n\nEach outfit comes with a hat, top and bottom.\n\nThe Timely Tailor bundle (1275/Outfit - 2250/Bundle) includes Fine Chap, Good Fellow, and Lovely Lad outfits.\n\nEach outfit comes with a top and bottom.\n\nThe Kilima Cook bundle (1275/Outfit - 2250/Bundle) includes Delaila’s Ranch, Ashura’s Inn, and Badruu’s Garden outfits.\n\nEach outfit comes with a hat, top and bottom.\n\nThe Strapped In bundle (1275/Outfit - 2250/Bundle) includes Urban Ruins, Neon Nightlife, and Garden City outfits.\n\nEach outfit comes with a face mask, top and bottom.\n\nTop Bug Fixes\n\n⭐ The Biggest Fixes ⭐\n\nWe've made some fixes so that cross-region traveling should see some improvements!\n\nOur last patch we made sweeping improvements to our Accomplishments and Achievements.

      "# [The Software Architecture of Palia](https://www.singularity6.com/news/software-architecture-of-palia)\nSingularity6’s debut game, Palia, is a free-to-play cozy online multiplayer community simulator. A place where players can play alone or with their friends to experience a beautiful and welcoming world which can be explored and personalized.\n\nSocial interaction and a persistent shared world are key features of the game. But these elements are also some of the most challenging to implement, scale, distribute geographically, and operate at minimal operational cost and negative player impact.\n\nPlayers experience the art and soul that our development team has poured into the game, but the infrastructure that makes it all possible behind the scenes is hidden from view. We are proud of what our team has accomplished with Palia, and we want to spotlight the studio’s hard work, including what players don’t experience directly. We also want to share some important lessons learned during our journey; we hope that sharing the lessons learned while developing Palia can be useful to others facing similar challenges.\n\nNow follow us behind the scenes of our Palia development journey!\n\nGame Engine\n\nBuilding an online multiplayer title from scratch benefits from a robust and proven game engine. We made the choice to build Palia using Unreal Engine. Unreal gives us powerful tools to build with out of the box, such as a strong networking and replication library to build social features, a graphics pipeline to build a beautiful world, a powerful physics engine that can simulate complex environments, and so much more. We use Unreal Engine for our game servers as well as our client, which gives players a real-time interactive environment.\n\nEach instance of the game server currently hosts up to 25 players, and we split up each server by what we call a map. These can be permanent fixtures, including our central hub Kilima Village, or even temporary available experiences, such as our Maji Market, which was only available for one month during our Luna New Year in-game event. When players travel between maps in Palia, the game client disconnects from one server and connects to a new one. We will share more details on how this works in our matchmaking service deep dive section.\n\nThis synergistic model is crucial for our team: we can develop most of the logic for Palia inside the engine and deploy to both clients and servers. This allows anyone on the team to test both the game and the game server in editor mode, which has been critical for our development velocity.\n\nSpotlight: memory leakage\n\nUnreal Engine servers are commonly used in “session-based games,” such as Fortnite: games that start and end within a certain amount of time. Memory leakage is not a big concern for session-based games because a new server is spun up for a new match and destroyed when the match ends. Any leaked memory will be cleaned before the next batch of players begin playing.\n\nPalia is a persistent shared-world game and the lifespan of our game servers is variable depending on how players move through the game world. A single game server may remain online and serve players for an entire patch cycle which could be weeks. Memory leakage which is cleaned up regularly for a session-based game can grow and compound, and small leaks might end up consuming two or even four times the amount of Random Access Memory (RAM) proportionally affecting our operational costs.\n\nTo combat this issue, we invested in solutions to help us identify memory leaks, and we spent useful time designing nudges for players to travel between maps as to increase the likelihood that a server would empty out and be shut down.\n\nUnexpectedly and fortunately, increasing geographical distribution helped with this problem: hosting servers near players not only helps with latency (because it reduces the distance that signals need to travel); but also with rotating empty servers because players tend to play at the same times, making it rare that somebody in that region is playing in the middle of the night and increasing the probability of servers to become empty, shut down, and cleaned.\n\nThis screenshot from one of our monitoring dashboards shows the memory usage of a portion of our game servers over a24h period in Feb 2024. The trend of linear memory increase is clearly visible.\n\nServices\n\nThe game client and servers talk to our services for specific actions, such as logging players into the game, loading characters, saving progress, sending chat messages to other players, making purchased outfits are stored in the player’s closet and many more.\n\nWe loosely follow a “microservice” posture, in which we prefer to host many different services specialized on one player feature.\n\nWe use HTTP as the North/South protocol (in and out of the datacenter) while we use gRPC for East/West communication (for services talking to each other inside the datacenter).\n\nWe use Rust exclusively as the programming language for our services and we try to include both integration and load testing as part of the definition of “done” for key services, including matchmaking, player presence and player state persistence which represent the largest percentage of our request load.\n\nOur unit and integration tests are also written in Rust, but we use Locust to support and execute our load tests. Locust load tests are written in Python which is simpler to program. The ability to quickly write and modify load tests was beneficial to us and sped up adoption.\n\nSpotlight: Rust for Microservices\n\nRust is a beloved programming language by many systems programmers because it provides state-of-the-art protection against common software vulnerabilities (buffer overflows and race conditions, for example) without introducing any performance penalties.\n\nRust is also a modern programming language. It is surrounded by a diverse and vibrant community of contributors and a wide range of libraries and tools. Documentation is excellent (especially onboarding tutorials) and the compiler is surely one of the most helpful and user-friendly.\n\nOf course, no programming language is perfect. Rust's posture is heavily focused on correctness, which is generally beneficial, but comes with a significant upfront cost which is visible in our development velocity. Rust makes it very hard to “cut corners” and punt hardening for later. It is a very good quality when something that was supposed to be just a prototype becomes load bearing in production by sheer pressure of business needs, but it makes it hard to move quickly and with agility around shifting requirements (which is a constant in startups and game development).\n\nThe other issue was hiring and onboarding. Rust’s relative youth as a programming language makes it somewhat difficult to hire people that have production experience with the language. Although the language is very popular, few people have used Rust in a professional team setting. Most people who have Rust experience have only used it for personal projects. With this in mind, onboarding took much longer than we expected. We factored 90 days to get engineers up to speed, but it turned out to take at least 6 months for most of the team to get comfortable and confident with the language.\n\nWe are very happy with the performance, latency, scalability, robustness and security of our Rust services. But there are moments when we wonder how much opportunity cost was spent in forcing up-front solidity of every piece of this layer.\n\nWe consider it an advantage for the studio to have managed to amortize those onboarding costs and the maintenance costs of our services is indeed very low, but those thinking of following our footsteps down the Rust path, should be willing to allocate a significant effort to education and onboarding. These costs will likely reduce over time as Rust becomes more popular in production settings, but it’s unclear what that rate will be.\n\nSeveral of our services are interesting and sophisticated enough to merit more attention: player state management and matchmaking.\n\nPlayer State Management\n\nWe consider player state all the information that a game server needs to recreate the most recent game world experienced by the player. The architecture of our game is server-authoritative which means that game servers decide the state of the world and act as referees when game clients report inconsistent data (for example, because of time delay in transmission). We took this route because Palia is a social game so a player cheating or modifying their state could have a negative impact on the experience of other players. The risk of cheating is reduced when it's our system that ultimately controls player state.\n\nThe simplest way to persist state is to wait until a player exits a game server and have the server send this information to the database. Unfortunately, this makes state changes in that server vulnerable to the server itself crashing and losing that data (which is only kept in volatile memory for performance reasons). Instead, several times a second we check for player state changes, and if there are any, that data is immediately queued and sent to the database to be persisted.\n\nSpotlight: data first vs. schema first\n\nA source of contention around player state is the modeling lifecycle: who and what decides what is valid to be stored into such a state? Traditional data-modeling techniques suggest a “schema first” approach: the structure of the data (the schema) is created ahead of time and then only data that conforms to that structure can be saved into the database.\n\nThis has the advantage that the database validates the shape of the data. The disadvantage is that one has to know ahead of time the structure of the data needed… which can be challenging to coordinate across different teams.\n\nTo increase the ease with which game engineers and technical designers could work, we decided on a different model in which the structure of the data would be decided in C++ structs directly within Unreal and then marshaled and persisted in the database as a binary blob (using the Flexbuffer format). The schema is the struct declaration itself and we use Unreal’s runtime type reflection system to export the schema to our database.\n\nThe advantage of this architectural choice is that it enabled game engineers to develop features that required state persistence without the need for constant coordination. The downside is that the data is opaque to the database, which is more expensive to keep uniform and consolidated. This has required us to invest in additional tooling around the player state management system to validate, backup, modify and correct player state when it diverges from the expected structure.\n\nDespite the additional layer of development investment needed to provide hardening on top of what the database normally provides, we believe this architecture has significantly cut down the time required to deliver new features with data persistence, such as our most recent Luna New Year event.\n\nMatchmaking\n\nIn many competitive-style online games, matchmaking is the process of selecting people for a match. For Palia, matchmaking means matching the player with the game server that we believe will give players the best gameplay experience.\n\nThere are several dimensions that we take into consideration during matching:\n\nLocation - how far away the game server is from where the player is currently playing (because closer server means lower latency and lower latency means a more fluid and immersive experience)\n\nFriends - how many of the player’s friends are currently playing on that server (because the more people they know the more meaningful their interaction will be)\n\nPopulation - how many people are playing on that server (because the more people are playing the more alive the world feels)\n\nThe matchmaking system is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing us to add more signals to the matching algorithm over time if we desire.\n\nAnother crucial feature of the matchmaking system is the ability to distinguish “join” requests and “travel” requests. A join request happens when a player starts the game and wants to join. A travel request is a match required by a player leaving one map of the game and traveling to another.\n\nThe ability to distinguish the two allows us to offer priority to “travel” requests when the system is under load and there is high contention. This is because it’s far less disruptive for players to wait a few minutes to join and then wait only a few seconds to travel between maps, than one in which the delays are spread uniformly across all matching requests.\n\nThis screenshot shows a piece of the dashboard we use to monitor queue sizes and the distribution of times it takes for a matchmaking request (join or travel) to be satisfied.\n\nSpotlight: game-aware internal queueing and autoscaling\n\nEvery empty server running in the cloud without a player on it is a waste of money. On the other hand, there might be players who want to play and all of the game servers have their allocated slots filled so they would benefit from an empty server to land in.\n\nMany online games design “login queues” or similar ways to restrict the inbound flow of players and scale up or down the number of servers to meet the demand. Originally, this was our intent as well, but we realized we would benefit from a more sophisticated matchmaking design that could distinguish between joining and traveling. We also realized that the matchmaker had all the information it needed to control the size of the game server fleet.\n\nThis is how we came up with the Admiral: a component of the matchmaking system that oversees the fleet of game servers. The Admiral understands when the current fleet of game servers is insufficient to satisfy the number of players requesting a match and is able to ask the underlying cloud system (specifically Agones) to request the creation of more game server instances. Agones, on the other hand, is responsible for shutting down game servers that have been empty for some time.\n\nThe integration of autoscaling with matchmaking and the separation of concerns between the Admiral (scaling up) and Agones (scaling down) has served us very well and has managed to provide us with shock absorption to the game when things didn’t go as planned. Several times, the elasticity of these queues between maps have saved the team from having to bring down the game entirely to fix issues during misaligned deployments or unforeseen behaviors during load spikes.\n\nThis screenshot shows the view of the game servers fleet from the Admiral. Each line is really two lines: one for the “desired size” and another for the “actual size”. This information is used to tell the cloud orchestrator to spin up more game servers for a particular map type as they are needed by players being matched to servers that don’t yet exist.\n\nData Management\n\nOur architecture of loosely coupled software components wouldn’t be very useful without data flowing between them and being persisted, validated, or aggregated.\n\nDatabases\n\nOne of the most difficult elements of creating a shared perpetual world is constructing the ability for players to influence it (and one another) in a context that feels immediate and consistent. A key factor to provide a positive player experience is the choice of the database architecture.\n\nWe decided to use ScyllaDB as our main data persistence layer. ScyllaDB is a C++ rewrite of Apache Cassandra (originally created at Facebook and, in turn, heavily influenced by Google BigTable and Amazon DynamoDB), a distributed column store.\n\nThe biggest advantage of ScyllaDB for us has been its elastic scalability and its cloud native “design for failure” posture that aligned very well with ours. One significant advantage of ScyllaDB for us is the ability to attach replication strategy to a table but eventual consistency levels to a query. This gives us a lot of flexibility because in some cases we need consistency more than we need speed and we can tune that directly at the query level. This is not possible with traditional relational databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL.\n\nThis functionality is crucial, for example, when dealing with a persistent player state: we want the data to be replicated on multiple computers before we return a response to the game server. This means that both the game server and multiple database nodes have to die (at the very same time!) for that player state update to get lost. As far as we can tell, this has never happened.\n\nWe also use PostgreSQL (hosted for us by AWS) for the catalog of our outfits available for purchase in the game. We used a relational database here because we felt it was better suited for this particular job.\n\nAsynchronous Messaging\n\nAnother important part of the data management layer is the ability of software components to message one another asynchronously.\n\nWe have two of such busses:\n\nThe first for aggregates and collects telemetry for player behavior (which uses Apache Kafka, more on this later) and feeds our analytics and machine learning pipelines.\n\nAnother coordinates software components (for example, the control plane between the fleet auto-scaler and the game servers). This uses EMQX as the broker and MQTT as the protocol.\n\nWhy two? Mostly because they serve different purposes, have different strengths and weaknesses, and are managed by different teams focusing on separate outcomes. There might be value in consolidating things further in the future, but for now this separation is serving us well.\n\nSpotlight: MQTT and Apache ActiveMQ v5 (aka Artemis)\n\nThe use of MQTT as the message bus protocol for our game servers control planes was decided precisely to isolate us from lock-in of a particular broker implementation. In retrospect, this was a weak choice: MQTT is an IoT protocol and we were attracted by the fact that it was designed for devices with small power and low bandwidth. We wanted a solution that would be easy and cheap for the game servers to interact with and didn’t consume a lot of their resources.\n\nUnfortunately, many MQTT brokers simply implemented that protocol on top of their existing native systems. We picked Apache ActiveMQ v5 (aka Artemis) because it was established and it supported v5 of the MQTT protocol (which offered features we needed) but was written and designed before clouds existed and turned out to be incompatible with our preferred “loosely coupled components expected to fail” architectural posture.\n\nArtemis has been the source of much apprehension and tribulation. We ended up having to patch the software to fit our needs. We operated with a forked version in production just to keep it from falling over regularly (the MQTT layer and cross-regional federation layers did not work well together).\n\nWe have since migrated to EMQX which is a more modern MQTT broker, designed from the ground-up with MQTT in mind and we have not looked back.\n\nThe lesson learned here is that even established and battle-tested software might still end up performing poorly when utilized in a different context and with different operational constraints than was originally intended.\n\nData Pipelines\n\nAnother important principle of our software architecture is that we want to be able to observe and monitor how the system is behaving so that we can act on it effectively when behavior deviates from the norm.\n\nWe treat data differently based on whether the decision making that it supports is latency sensitive or not. In fact, we use completely different systems for low-latency decision support (seconds to minutes) vs. high-latency (days or weeks).\n\nSpotlight: player behavior vs. system behavior\n\nIn the past, we separated data based on whether it was about player behavior or software behavior. But we quickly realized that distinction was not very helpful in practice.\n\nFor example, a purchasing event from a player is technically a player behavior and insights gathered from them influence strategic decision making with high-latency (days or weeks). But such a high-latency reaction would be detrimental to both our players and our revenue if we didn’t get notified immediately if the frequency of purchases dropped outside of the normal range of operation.\n\nIt is generally true that data generated from the behavior of players influences decision making in aggregate and with high latency while events generated by the behavior of software systems influences decisions and actions that require quick reaction times. But our ability to route data based on decision making latency needs and not on the semantics of origin has made it easier to reason about data routing decisions, especially when the two pipelines are handled by different teams with different skills, strengths, and goals.\n\nObservability\n\nWe picked Prometheus as the time-series database powering the low-latency data pipeline and alerting. The key advantage here is the “pull” model in which it is Prometheus to “scrape” data from our software components, which makes it a lot simpler to maintain.\n\nWe also use Grafana as our visual dashboarding system querying the data stored in Prometheus along with Loki and Tempo to deal textual logs and tracing the flow of execution across several of our software components.\n\nLastly, we use Sloth to automate the generation of SLOs.\n\nAnalytics\n\nThe high-latency data pipeline revolves around Apache Kafka (managed for us by Confluent) which captures and routes the data as well as Apache Spark (managed for us by Databricks), which we use to aggregate and analyze the data.\n\nWe use Apache Airflow (managed for us by Astronomer) for monitoring and scheduling long-running workflows for data aggregation and analysis. Lastly, we use Tableau to power the visualization of the insights that result from our data analysis.\n\nCloud Infrastructure\n\nAnother development challenge is the “free-to-play” nature of our distribution strategy. This approach made it difficult to predict the amount of players that would play the game, especially around key events, such as platform launches, major updates, and in-game events.\n\nWe decided to be “cloud native” from the start because “elasticity” in supply of computation and bandwidth is a key advantage that cloud providers have over acquiring and maintaining our own server infrastructure; especially for gaming startups (for which capital is constrained) and when deploying across multiple geographical regions.\n\nCloud native for us didn’t simply mean: “run our programs on somebody else’s computer.” Cloud native for us meant designing a software architecture composed of small pieces that are loosely coupled and always expected to fail.\n\nWe call this “designing for failure.” Of course, we never want our systems to fail. However, we believe that resiliency in software systems comes less from preventing failure, and more from providing mitigations to such risks and the ability to restore service as quickly and automatically as possible. We want to design to reduce failure but we always expect it to happen, so when it does happen, our systems would not be surprised by it.\n\nKey components of this strategy were using Kubernetes as our orchestration system, Linkerd as our service mesh, Traefik as our load balancer and Agones to manage our fleet of game servers. We also rely heavily on the “infrastructure as code” principle, using Kustomize to help us keep our configurations DRY and ArgoCD to power continuous deployments.\n\nKubecost helps us measure costs, and we recently swapped from cluster-autoscaler to Karpenter to optimize cluster elasticity and to help pick the best server instances. This change allowed us to save a non-trivial percentage of our cloud costs by automating the selection of instance types to use to run our workloads.\n\nFor provisioning infrastructure we rely on Terraform and Spacelift. We rely on Vault to store secrets without our cloud environments. We also conduct chaos testing using Litmus.\n\nAnd we rely on a few different services for authentication and authorization systems, including FusionAuth for account management, Zendesk for customer support management, Stripe for payment processing, and Vivox for our in-game chat system.\n\nOur only cloud provider is Amazon Web Services which provides us computers, storage, and bandwidth across multiple regions: United States, Germany, and Japan. We also rely on Cloudflare for geo-aware DNS and load balancing as well as DDoS protection.\n\nSpotlight: Nomad vs. Kubernetes\n\nWe had originally chosen Nomad as our orchestration solution, mostly because it was perceived to be conceptually simpler and it was much more compatible with Windows workloads (which we thought we might need for testing purposes).\n\nUnfortunately, Nomad had one very significant problem: the momentum of the development community around it was significantly smaller than around Kubernetes. This had two significant issues for us: a) we had to develop in-house solutions that the community around Kubernetes had already implemented; and b) it was harder to engage the team with a technology that many considered an evolutionary dead-end.\n\nWe made the difficult call to switch our cloud orchestration system by using the argument that our development velocity would significantly improve and our operational risks would be reduced. This turned out to be very much the case and it’s a decision we would happily make again.\n\nBuild Systems\n\nThere are two primary concepts used in the building of Palia and its supporting services: the build platform and the build system. Historically, game studios lumped these two together around the primary continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) component. We borrowed some plays from large-scale build and release systems beyond gaming: using a heavily distributed approach inspired by some of our team members’ experiences in other industries, such as banking.\n\nTo power the build system we use Jenkins, but take care to draw a distinction between the software, and the underlying infrastructure upon which it runs and integrates. While related, these things are best served by intentional, separate configuration management and Infrastructure as Code practices which can quickly become unwieldy and complex if attempting to do so under a monolithic design. The result is a hybrid cloud approach to the build system. We use both an on-prem data center and Amazon Web Services, and one side of the architecture can be maintained without potentially negatively impacting the other.\n\nWe also took the time to redesign the initial version of the build system (Jenkins pipelines) around Unreal Engine’s native tooling, namely, BuildGraph. Doing so required a lot of work up-front as the old method was cobbled together between Jenkins Pipelines and Python scripts, but the declarative nature of BuildGraph tooling has allowed us to increase correctness, reduce build system maintenance, and increase flexibility such that we can build almost every target platform with minimal specific changes for each. A key component of this success was integrating with AutoSDK and creating a “standard library” of sorts in Jenkins to glue it all together.\n\nIn our latest version of the build platform we are able to mostly dynamically scale the number of executors based on demand. The build system can then simply act as a “glue layer” to distribute requested tasks among the available executors as parallel pipeline runs. Further, we’ve incorporated designing for Self-Service by other teams, such that they can “pick and choose” which artifacts they want built via a single interface. We call this the “Prime Pipeline,” which presents a series of configurable parameters and then schedules the running of “Sub-Pipelines” to do the work, passing those parameters as appropriate. This means that via the same Prime Pipeline interface, one Engineer could choose to build only one Platform Client from the library of Clients available, and one Server, getting only those two artifacts; or they could select everything and end up with every Client and Server we currently offer as targets.\n\nSpotlight: Capacity Management in a Hybrid Cloud World\n\nA trade-off we make for this level of granularity and distribution is the initial difficulty in managing capacity. We use several build executors of different types and had to really break-down our pipelines and how each stage would be distributed to the executors both on-prem and in AWS. Then we had to measure a single run of each pipeline to get more accurate numbers to use for calculating instance sizes, costs, expected load, and timings for stage and whole pipeline execution. This cost us a lot of time up-front, and while we are glad we did it, it is yet another piece of operational overhead which must be monitored, reviewed, and adjusted in order to remain reasonably accurate. Changing something as simple as the Node Label of a particular pipeline Stage can have serious impacts to all of the metrics we measure, most notably, build times. Unfortunately, there aren't a whole lot of “drop-in” or “off-the-shelf” solutions for these types of systems, so we have had to track these things manually, and then automate as we go to attempt to reduce the operational burden.\n\nFurthermore, managing two different sets of infrastructure is not for the faint of heart, or those unfamiliar with Hybrid Cloud management. While the patterns may be very similar, the implementation proved to be a lot more work than we anticipated.\n\nFor example, AWS and other cloud service providers make APIs available to interact on a very granular level with their exposed components. On the other end of the spectrum, even the most mature on-prem infrastructure providers rely on their own custom tooling for managing hardware components. This is why projects such as Ansible are in such heavy use in the IT industry, and S6 is no exception here as we prioritize the use of open source tools where possible to ease cognitive load and keep costs low.\n\nThe challenge that made this most difficult was the disparity in experience using this approach on our team members’ time. Some of us come from more of a Platforming background, others from a Tooling background, and still others from primarily a Jenkins Pipeline writing background. This is great for general cross-functionality within the team, but requires careful planning to execute well even among the highest-performing teams.\n\nVersion Control\n\nWe use two different version control systems to manage the development lifecycle of our code: Perforce for the game code, and git (hosted in Bitbucket) for everything else.\n\nUsing different version control systems is clearly suboptimal and not a decision we took lightly: git is generally preferred by backend engineers and is far better supported by modern development environments.\n\nUnfortunately, Perforce is very well integrated in Unreal Engine because that’s what Epic Games uses (the makers of Unreal Engine). Also, git isn’t really designed to work with very large binary files, and a lot of our in-game assets and original sources are giant binary files. Perforce works well in these situations.\n\nEarly on, we tried using git-lfs (large file storage), which is supposed to help with this problem but we gave up when we realized how much effort it would be to retrofit all of the Epic development tools (UnrealGameSync, for example) to work with git.\n\nWe sincerely wish we had a single consolidated version control system and code review workflow, but it is not a trivial exercise.\n\nSpotlight: Consolidated Repos\n\nOne of the issues we faced with git was that it was too easy and convenient to create new repositories, causing a proliferation of them. The biggest issue we faced was the inability to make changes that cross-cut different services at once. This created a lot of production overhead and reduced our ability to consolidate the behavior of services.\n\nWe considered switching to a full “monorepo” but many of us were unfamiliar with it and feared additional complexity and overhead that we had no additional development capacity to support.\n\nThe compromise we reached was a handful of consolidated repos in which many individual git repositories were merged into a single repository and then archived. All the microservices ended up in this single repository, but they could be developed, built, tested and deployed in isolation. This made it much easier to modify code across services (such as version dependencies) as well as simplifying the creation of libraries. This approach facilitated an incremental externalization of common functionality into modules that could be more easily reused across services, reducing copy/paste code duplication and reducing our maintenance costs.\n\nSaaS-y Open Source\n\nOne common theme you might have noticed in our architecture is that we prefer to depend on software that is open source and that we could host ourselves if we wanted/needed to. We also prefer to rely on a SaaS vendor that provides and manages this software for us instead of running it ourselves.\n\nThis offers us several advantages:\n\nWe are not locked into a particular cloud or vendor provider (as we could run the system ourselves if we needed to).\n\nWe can provision systems more quickly (our people don’t need to learn the intricacies of configuring them).\n\nLeverage vendor expertise to fix issues and/or edge cases when we encounter them.\n\nKeeps the vendor prices under control under our threat of shutting down our vendor contract and hosting the system ourselves.\n\nWe deviated from this posture only rarely and when there was no open source alternative that made sense for our business needs. However, we do believe this paradigm worked well for us and provides a way to fund and support further development of these open source projects. This, in turn, lowers our future risks by helping make the development of these open projects more sustainable (as these hosting vendors often employ contributors to the open source projects and continue to fund their contributions for mutually symbiotic benefit).\n\nConclusions\n\nIt’s rare to get access to the source code that makes up video games, so it’s rare to have the opportunity to learn directly from it. Even rarer is a view into the decisions and tradeoffs, the lessons learned, the paths not taken and those taken but with later regret.\n\nWe hope that this deep-dive on the challenges and successes of creating Palia’s software architecture provides some insight and inspiration for others facing similar challenges.\n\nIf you have any questions about Palia’s software architecture and development, or simply if you want to start a conversation feel free to reach out to us at hello@singularity6.com.\n\nSpecial Thanks\n\nThe list of people that contributed to this architecture is very long (see the Palia credits for the full list) and we wouldn’t do it justice to replicate it here.

The beloved Maji Market makes its grand return to the Kilima Village Fairgrounds, bringing with it all the excitement, enchantment, and mouth-watering treats you all know and love!\n\nWhether you’re a seasoned adventurer or new to the world of Palia, Maji Market offers a chance to connect with your friends and villagers within the bustling night market like never before.\n\nYou’ll showcase your skills in various minigames, immerse yourself in vibrant Palian culture, fill your stamp card to the brim, sample all the merchant goodies on offer, and take in the whimsical atmosphere that only this magical event can provide.\n\nKeep a lookout for your invitation in the mail! And while Maji Market remains only open between the Palian hours of 6 p.m. to 3 a.m; you’ll have a lot more time to complete all that Maji Market has to offer. The villagers had so much fun during the last Maji Market, they’ve decided to bring it back on a regular basis! You can expect to visit the night market for one week every month moving forward! 🎆\n\nDuring this patch, Maji Market will be running for a week, starting immediately. It will then return for a week starting on Tuesday, Oct. 8, and come back every four weeks. To preview what that looks like, these are the weeks Maji Market will be active.\n\nStarts Sept. 24 at 12am PT - Ends Sept. 30 at 11:59pm PT\n\nStarts Oct. 8 at 12am PT - Ends Oct. 14 at 11:59pm PT\n\nStarts Nov. 5 at 12am PT - Ends Nov. 11 at 11:59pm PT\n\nStarts Dec. 3 at 12am PT - Ends Dec. 9 at 11:59pm PT\n\nContinuing every 4 weeks\n\nBrand New Maji Market Quests, Games, and More\n\nThe new and improved Maji Market mixes the classic 🎪fare🎪 that players know and love with brand new minigames, quests, and collectables.\n\nThe familiar night market minigame Chapaa Chase is a Maji Market staple, and players can again expect to hustle and heave as many chapaas as they can.\n\nStamp Cards are also returning alongside all of the merchants, vendors, and kiosks to spend your hard-earned tickets and earn accomplishments. While progress from the last Maji Market will not carry over, your Stamp Card progress, collection, and accomplishments will carry over month-to-month! So if Maji Market wraps before you complete an achievement, you can pick up right where you left off in the next month’s night market.\n\nAnd while we don’t want to give too much away, event-goers can look forward to several new activities, quests, and collectables.\n\nNew and returning Maji Market attendees will test their reflexes in Pop-A-Chapaa, where players can work together to earn tickets! Every night at 8 p.m. Palia time, balloons will release from the water around the dock, and you and your friends can team-up to blast the balloons out of the sky. Everyone that participates will earn tickets; and the more collective balloons popped, the more tickets earned! And like Hassian always says (probably), “you miss 100 percent of the shots you don’t take.” So don’t worry about letting loose [your arrows]. Everyone that participates has infinite arrows and bow durability during the game.\n\nPer usual, Zeki has set up shop and brings a whole new attraction to the night market: Zeki’s Claw Machine. Players that spend tickets within the market have a chance to earn a Claw Machine Token. The more tickets you spend on an item, the better chance you’ll have to earn a token. But items that cost 6,000 tickets or more are guaranteed to come with a token. Toss a token in Zeki’s Claw Machine for a chance to win one of six Li’l Plushes (not a typo, hehe).\n\nAdditionally, players can expect many more attractions to keep them coming back, including:\n\nMaji Market Exclusive Miniquests: Complete more than 8 new miniquests exclusive to the Maji Market that will have you coming back to the market for weeks on end.\n\nMaji Market Exclusive Nameplate: Save up some tickets and purchase the Maji Market exclusive Nameplate from the Chapaa Tchotchkes popup.\n\nNight Market Photo Ops: Influence your friends and party-up to snap some pics at all the best photo op locations… you might find a totally normal Human Standee… minding its own business… probably doing big business…\n\nChapaa Popsicle Emote: No chapaas were licked in the making of this emote. Equip the new Chapaa Popsicle emote from your Collections menu today!\n\nDrums, Please!: March to the beat of your own drum and re-discover an explosive surprise. 🎆\n\nMarket Discovery: Those that know where to look might stumble upon a few surprises – but make sure to keep that knowledge close to the chest! 🤫\n\nPalia’s Autumn Awakening\n\nFall is in full swing in Palia and we have the foliage to prove it! Take a break from the hustle and bustle of the adventurer’s life and snap some photos with friends at the many leaf piles scattered around Kilima Village before the season changes again later in late November. And the most eagle-eyed players might notice the trees have begun to change color!\n\nBut most importantly, the Spooky Moon Shop is back! Everyone’s favorite haunt can be found behind Zeki’s store if you’re in the market for scary-good deals. Purchasable items include:\n\nSpooky Pumpkin\n\nSpooky Jaak-O-Lantern\n\nSpooky Sernuk-O-Lantern\n\nSpooky Candles\n\nSpooky Floating Candle\n\nSpooky Pumpkin Stack\n\nSpooky Vined Pumpkin\n\nSpooky Pumpkin Wallpaper\n\nSpooky Fall Leaves*\n\nSpooky Leaf Pile*\n\n*These items were originally released as part of last year’s Winterlights Shop, but we felt they would be more at home in the Spooky Moon Shop.\n\nPotato Pod Log-in Rewards\n\nThe next batch of Potato Pod log-in rewards have arrived! These tube-ular collectables are a grounded addition for any Palian home!\n\nAs always, the only way to receive a Potato Pod is to log-in during the specified timeframe. You’ll need to log-in at least once between 10 a.m. PT on Wednesday, Sept. 25 and 10 a.m. PT on Tuesday, Oct. 8; and then again between 10 a.m. PT on Wednesday, Oct. 9 and 10 a.m. PT on Monday, Oct. 21.\n\nYou’ll receive one Potato Pod for each log-in reward period for an opportunity to earn a total of two Potato Pods for the duration of the Autumn Awakening update.\n\nWe’ll be giving plenty of more Potato Pods with each new update (including Twitch Drops!) , and you’ll want to stock up ahead of our trading system’s debut so you can complete your collection! 🥔\n\nImprovements & Adjustments\n\nQuests will now prioritize Non-Star Quality Items\n\nWhen players have both Star Quality and Non-Star Quality items in their inventory when turning in a quest, Villagers will default to the Non-Star Quality items.\n\nHome Tour Tier 4 Nameplate reaction adjustments\n\nThe number of Home Tour reactions required to earn the Tier 4 Nameplate has been reduced from 1,000 to 500.\n\nPremium Store Updates\n\nTwo new outfits have been added to the Premium Store, available immediately.\n\nBundle Name Outfit Names Pieces Price (Per Outfit/Bundle) Ancient Champion Phoenix Sworn Hat, Top, Bottom 2550 Palia Coins\n\nShowcase your strength and honor and wield your blade in the service of the Phoenix when you don the Ancient Champion outfit. 🤺🐦‍🔥\n\nDedicate yourself to the stars when you become a celestial vassal clad in the Lunar Devotee outfit. 🌕 💫\n\nEquip a more civilized weapon from a more elegant age.\n\nSwing a sword rather than an axe when you purchase the Ancient Champion Tool Skin for 850 Palia Coins.

It’s actually performed fairly well for EG7 over the last few years, though it dipped at the end of 2023, sold off the PlanetSide IP, and relinquished development of PlanetSide 2. Buying an existing studio and game actually aligns rather nicely with EG7’s stated goals of running consistent mid-tier MMORPG moneymakers.",
      "# [Palia studio Singularity 6 is the latest studio to suffer layoffs by Mollie Taylor on 2024-04-05](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/mmo/palia-studio-singularity-6-is-the-latest-studio-to-suffer-layoffs/)\nSingularity 6, the studio behind the cosy MMO Palia, is the latest developer to suffer layoffs. Just under 50 developers, around one third of the company, have been let go according to Polygon reporter Nicole Carpenter.\n\nEnvironmental artist Daphne Fiato tweeted \"Whelp, I've been laid off,\" following up with \"49 people Thanos snapped\". Other Singularity 6 folk joined to reveal they'd also been laid off, including Brian Ernst who tweeted they'd been with the developer for five years. One developer revealed via LinkedIn that they'd been given the news while on vacation, according to MMORPG.com.\n\nSingularity 6 is yet to publicly address the layoffs, with its last Twitter post happening on April 3, one day before they occurred. It's the same situation for the official Palia account.\n\nPalia only just arrived on Steam on March 25, following a stint as an Epic exclusive. The free-to-play MMO has generated some praise for its cosy vibes and its stress-free cycle of farming and building, but it's also been criticised for its slow progression, reliance on timers and limited multiplayer elements. Its development status has also led to some confusion—it's not in early access, and the store page implies a feature-complete game, when in reality it is still in beta. On Steam, it's currently sitting at just over 3,700 user reviews with a \"Mixed\" rating.\n\nThe studio joins a painfully long line of developers to have nixed a portion of its staff this year. Despite only being four months into the year, the number of layoffs are close to reaching last year's count. It was estimated that around 10,500 developers lost their jobs last year, according to the Game Industry Layoffs tracker. The number is already up to around 8000 estimated job losses right now, with more undoubtedly on their way given the volatility of the industry.",

It laid off 49 employees in April 2024, just a couple weeks after Palia arrived on Steam, and then cut 36 more in May, representing about 40 percent of its remaining employees.\n\nDaybreak Game Company, a developer and publisher of MMOs including Everquest 2, DC Universe Online, Planetside 2, Lord of the Rings Online, and Dungeons and Dragons Online, has had some struggles of its own in recent years: In 2022 an in-development Marvel MMO was cancelled, and in February 2024 it laid off \"less than 15\" employees as part of a \"recalibration of our business.\"\n\n\"From Day 1, we have always wanted to forge alternate worlds that help deepen players’ lives—we believe we are on the path to that with Palia and are ever grateful for the initial player reception and support,\" Leung said. \"But we ultimately want to get Palia into the hands of every gamer that wants to play it and we believe that we can best do so by partnering up with Daybreak, who have a proven track record of building gaming communities that last for decades.

      "# [Enad Global 7 (Owner of Daybreak Games) Acquires Palia Developer Singularity 6 by Omer Altay on 2024-07-02](https://mmos.com/news/enad-global-7-owner-of-daybreak-games-acquires-palia-developer-singularity-6)\nEnad Global 7, the owner of Daybreak Games (think EverQuest, Dungeons & Dragons Online, DC Universe Online, etc), announced today that they acquired Singularity 6, the developer behind the free to play 'cozy' farming simulator Palia. No terms were disclosed, but Enad Global 7 did say they would fund the acquisition with cash on hand, which stood at ~$9m last quarter, which leads me to believe the acquisition was completed at $9m or less.\n\nWhile Palia maintains a respectable playerbase on Steam (averaging a little over 8,000 concurrent players over the last 30 days), the game was not considered a success, as it had a budget of over $40 million. The game's new owner, Enad Global 7, is a small game developer based in Sweden valued at ~$120m.\n\nEnad Global 7 was pleased to announce the acquisition and is optimistic about Palia's prospects:\n\nPalia is just beginning its journey and it is off to an excellent start. Palia was originally released in open beta through S6’s own PC platform in August 2023 and since then has been released on Epic Game Store, Nintendo Switch and Steam. Throughout the open beta, S6 team has continued to deliver expanded gameplay and content, driving increases in player population and engagement. Over 4 million players have come to enjoy the experience in open beta so far and as of the end of June 2024, over 100,000 players have been actively enjoying the game daily. The game’s growth trends are promising with the game reaching peak concurrent user level on Steam with its latest update in June. The game is making great progress towards the completion of version 1.0, with a plan to release across all the major platforms, broadening the distribution and increasing the potential for significant further growth in player base going forward.\n\nFurther Reading: Official Announcement",
