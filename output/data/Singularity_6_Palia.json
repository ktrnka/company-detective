      "# [Singularity 6 is Going Remote Choice](https://www.singularity6.com/news/s6-remote-choice)\nSINGULARITY 6 was just a team of twenty individuals when we moved into our new office in West Los Angeles. It was 2020, and only two weeks later, the pandemic hit in full swing. We made the call to work remotely, and shared our experience in a previous blog post.\n\nSince then, we’ve announced our first game, successfully ran a number of testing phases, and grew to a company of over 135 people—all while supporting a remote work policy.\n\nBut one big question remained: What was our plan for returning to the office?\n\nWe’re happy to announce that S6 is going Remote Choice!\n\nWhat Remote Choice Means\n\nRemote Choice means we’re championing for our team to decide what’s best for them. They can choose to work remotely, return to our office, or somewhere in-between with a hybrid setup. Save for certain essential roles that require being onsite, this option will be available to our employees indefinitely. At the end of the day, we’re advocating for different needs, preferences, and circumstances of our Sixers, which is why we emphasize the word “choice.”\n\nAlong with the option to work at our LA-based office (and another we’re planning on opening in Orange County, CA), Sixers can choose to work remotely so long as they’re based in the following approved locations:\n\nUnited States\n\nCalifornia, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Michigan, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington\n\nCanada\n\nQuebec\n\nOf course, even with our employees spread across the continent, we’re still making an effort to bring Sixers together. We still want those casual chats and moments of joy that great ideas can come from, so office onsites, local team meet-ups, and digital events are in the works as we move forward.\n\nAnd Yes, We’re Still Hiring\n\nHere at S6, we believe online games can foster meaningful and memorable experiences. Palia will be our first attempt at realizing that vision, and development for it is heavily underway.\n\nTake a look at our careers page for our current job openings, or keep an eye out for future postings as we prepare for launch. We have over 30 positions available across a number of disciplines such as Art, Design, Engineering, and Talent Acquisition.",
      "# [Adventures in LA: S6 2022 Studio Summit](https://www.singularity6.com/news/s6-2022-summit)\nNew friends, community, crafting, mini-games, adventure… in Palia? Absolutely. But also in-person with the Singularity 6 team coming together at the 2022 studio summit!\n\nThe last week of September saw Sixers from across North America gather in sunny Los Angeles for a wholesome two-day all-hands conference that included nostalgic button-mashing at the arcade, creativity-fueled team bonding sessions, and studio leadership presentations served with a healthy side of memes (stonks, anyone?).\n\nThe summit was Singularity 6’s first company-wide meeting in 2022, and it couldn’t have come soon enough. The studio has more than doubled in size (!!!) since 2021, and the event was the first opportunity for nearly 150 Sixers to take a break from a virtual environment, meet IRL, cut loose, and bond over some friendly(ish) competitive blue shell-tossing kart racing action.\n\n“As our team continues to grow and scale, it was a big priority for us to bring the studio together in 2022,” said Singularity 6 CEO & Co-Founder Anthony Leung. “I was blown away by the energy that our team brought to the summit. It made me so happy to see new and veteran Sixers collaborating and showcasing the best of our company culture.”\n\nOff-key karaoke and welcoming dinner parties are wonderful. But the real (Chapaa?) meat and potatoes of the summit was the overwhelming sense of unity and camaraderie on display from Sixers participating in activities across the board. Group session outcomes in design, art, production, tech, and more proved that Sixers are truly player obsessed.\n\nSessions included no shortage of marshmallow-wielding Sixers working together to construct the tallest – if not the most structurally sound – spaghetti towers. Brainstorming Sixers ‘illuminated’ one corner of the conference room with a rainbow array of Post-It notes. And the entire studio crowdsourced polygonal works of art that represent our company values. Some pieces were more, uh, “abstract” than others. But all in all, these sessions showcased a shared ambition of creating experiences that enhances players' lives and celebrates the intricacies of the human condition through work, play, and community.\n\nAnd with diversity, equity, and inclusion serving as the backbone of the studio — our talented Sixer speakers were empowered to discuss a range of topics that detailed the holistic vision for Singularity 6 and an inclusive studio experience.\n\nWe want to give a HUGE shoutout to S6’s People Ops & Talent Acquisition team who planned the summit’s awesome activities, and we cannot wait to apply key learnings from the event as Singularity 6 continues to grow and build our world class team. Between Sixers hitting the one-two step for S-tier scores in dance simulators, and studio co-founders Aidan Karabaich and Anthony Leung sharing plans for the studio’s future, a refreshed Singularity 6 is poised to deliver games that forge alternate worlds that deepen players’ lives.",
      "# [Palia Community Demonstrates Player Excitement and Appeal of New IP](https://www.singularity6.com/news/palia-community-excitement)\nWe're pleased to share that Palia is showing significant momentum with strong community engagement numbers, including more than 600,000 signups, that demonstrate the growing appetite for an elevated cozy sim experience among a mainstream audience.\n\nWhen revealed in June 2021, Palia was instantly embraced by both core and casual gaming audiences. Within 3 months of the title reveal, more than 600,000 players filled out a survey to playtest the game, outpacing the number of followers of Steam’s most Wishlisted games. An impressive feat for a product still in development (if we don't say so ourselves!), demonstrating a strong desire from players for the type of meaningful online game experience that we're creating.\n\nWe're intentionally building Palia alongside players, as part of the studio’s approach to game development, so that S6 can respond to the community and make improvements at every stage, and over time. Even in the earliest phases of development, the studio cultivated a highly-engaged community that has grown to more than 100,000 Discord members. Additionally, we welcomed nearly 20,000 players across several Alpha tests in 2022 and 2023. In a single Alpha window, players logged more than 167,000 hours in a month, with top players averaging about 200 hours (!!!) of playtime.\n\nOur team is developing Palia to feel welcoming, playful and friendly, which resonated strongly with early adopters looking for a sense of community, acceptance and belonging. By having strong foundations in place for its community from the outset, Singularity 6 has built trust and respect with these early adopters, who continue to help shape the game and have become evangelists for its growing community.\n\nWe look forward to sharing more information about Palia and our amazing community in the future!",
      "# [TASTIC SPOOKY SEASON AT SINGULARITY 6](https://www.singularity6.com/news/s6-spooky-season)\nCelebrating spooky season in a remote-choice environment might scare the willies out of even the most intrepid videogame studio. But Singularity 6’s People Ops team qualmed fears and busted the ghosts of Halloween past by planning the most spook-tacular activities for the company’s participating Sixers.\n\nFestivities kicked-off with an absolute thriller… organizing a virtual movie night that overcomes horrifying technical challenges, including (and certainly not limited to), DEAD internet connections, BLOODCURDLING mute-button mashing, and a PETRIFYING amount of content options to choose from. But just when the night could have descended to an early grave; a new dawn was nigh. Aided by a generous movie-night meal stipend (monster wraps, anyone?), and an excellent film selection featuring a gorgeous pastel-colored exploration of Dia de los Muertos, virtual movie night was a resounding success\n\nAnd what happens in October when you gather more than 160 of the game industry’s most creative folks? An epic costume contest! And our talented Sixers did not disappoint. From murderous doppelgangers to flailing car dealership air-dancer tubes, the competition was stiff across all categories, such as Most Hilarious, Most Creative and the coveted Audience Choice Award.\n\nAll in all, the gamut of fiendishly-fun activities and costume entries helped make this year’s annual spooky-season celebration the best yet.",
      "# [The Software Architecture of Palia](https://www.singularity6.com/news/software-architecture-of-palia)\nSingularity6’s debut game, Palia, is a free-to-play cozy online multiplayer community simulator. A place where players can play alone or with their friends to experience a beautiful and welcoming world which can be explored and personalized.\n\nSocial interaction and a persistent shared world are key features of the game. But these elements are also some of the most challenging to implement, scale, distribute geographically, and operate at minimal operational cost and negative player impact.\n\nPlayers experience the art and soul that our development team has poured into the game, but the infrastructure that makes it all possible behind the scenes is hidden from view. We are proud of what our team has accomplished with Palia, and we want to spotlight the studio’s hard work, including what players don’t experience directly. We also want to share some important lessons learned during our journey; we hope that sharing the lessons learned while developing Palia can be useful to others facing similar challenges.\n\nNow follow us behind the scenes of our Palia development journey!\n\nGame Engine\n\nBuilding an online multiplayer title from scratch benefits from a robust and proven game engine. We made the choice to build Palia using Unreal Engine. Unreal gives us powerful tools to build with out of the box, such as a strong networking and replication library to build social features, a graphics pipeline to build a beautiful world, a powerful physics engine that can simulate complex environments, and so much more. We use Unreal Engine for our game servers as well as our client, which gives players a real-time interactive environment.\n\nEach instance of the game server currently hosts up to 25 players, and we split up each server by what we call a map. These can be permanent fixtures, including our central hub Kilima Village, or even temporary available experiences, such as our Maji Market, which was only available for one month during our Luna New Year in-game event. When players travel between maps in Palia, the game client disconnects from one server and connects to a new one. We will share more details on how this works in our matchmaking service deep dive section.\n\nThis synergistic model is crucial for our team: we can develop most of the logic for Palia inside the engine and deploy to both clients and servers. This allows anyone on the team to test both the game and the game server in editor mode, which has been critical for our development velocity.\n\nSpotlight: memory leakage\n\nUnreal Engine servers are commonly used in “session-based games,” such as Fortnite: games that start and end within a certain amount of time. Memory leakage is not a big concern for session-based games because a new server is spun up for a new match and destroyed when the match ends. Any leaked memory will be cleaned before the next batch of players begin playing.\n\nPalia is a persistent shared-world game and the lifespan of our game servers is variable depending on how players move through the game world. A single game server may remain online and serve players for an entire patch cycle which could be weeks. Memory leakage which is cleaned up regularly for a session-based game can grow and compound, and small leaks might end up consuming two or even four times the amount of Random Access Memory (RAM) proportionally affecting our operational costs.\n\nTo combat this issue, we invested in solutions to help us identify memory leaks, and we spent useful time designing nudges for players to travel between maps as to increase the likelihood that a server would empty out and be shut down.\n\nUnexpectedly and fortunately, increasing geographical distribution helped with this problem: hosting servers near players not only helps with latency (because it reduces the distance that signals need to travel); but also with rotating empty servers because players tend to play at the same times, making it rare that somebody in that region is playing in the middle of the night and increasing the probability of servers to become empty, shut down, and cleaned.\n\nThis screenshot from one of our monitoring dashboards shows the memory usage of a portion of our game servers over a24h period in Feb 2024. The trend of linear memory increase is clearly visible.\n\nServices\n\nThe game client and servers talk to our services for specific actions, such as logging players into the game, loading characters, saving progress, sending chat messages to other players, making purchased outfits are stored in the player’s closet and many more.\n\nWe loosely follow a “microservice” posture, in which we prefer to host many different services specialized on one player feature.\n\nWe use HTTP as the North/South protocol (in and out of the datacenter) while we use gRPC for East/West communication (for services talking to each other inside the datacenter).\n\nWe use Rust exclusively as the programming language for our services and we try to include both integration and load testing as part of the definition of “done” for key services, including matchmaking, player presence and player state persistence which represent the largest percentage of our request load.\n\nOur unit and integration tests are also written in Rust, but we use Locust to support and execute our load tests. Locust load tests are written in Python which is simpler to program. The ability to quickly write and modify load tests was beneficial to us and sped up adoption.\n\nSpotlight: Rust for Microservices\n\nRust is a beloved programming language by many systems programmers because it provides state-of-the-art protection against common software vulnerabilities (buffer overflows and race conditions, for example) without introducing any performance penalties.\n\nRust is also a modern programming language. It is surrounded by a diverse and vibrant community of contributors and a wide range of libraries and tools. Documentation is excellent (especially onboarding tutorials) and the compiler is surely one of the most helpful and user-friendly.\n\nOf course, no programming language is perfect. Rust's posture is heavily focused on correctness, which is generally beneficial, but comes with a significant upfront cost which is visible in our development velocity. Rust makes it very hard to “cut corners” and punt hardening for later. It is a very good quality when something that was supposed to be just a prototype becomes load bearing in production by sheer pressure of business needs, but it makes it hard to move quickly and with agility around shifting requirements (which is a constant in startups and game development).\n\nThe other issue was hiring and onboarding. Rust’s relative youth as a programming language makes it somewhat difficult to hire people that have production experience with the language. Although the language is very popular, few people have used Rust in a professional team setting. Most people who have Rust experience have only used it for personal projects. With this in mind, onboarding took much longer than we expected. We factored 90 days to get engineers up to speed, but it turned out to take at least 6 months for most of the team to get comfortable and confident with the language.\n\nWe are very happy with the performance, latency, scalability, robustness and security of our Rust services. But there are moments when we wonder how much opportunity cost was spent in forcing up-front solidity of every piece of this layer.\n\nWe consider it an advantage for the studio to have managed to amortize those onboarding costs and the maintenance costs of our services is indeed very low, but those thinking of following our footsteps down the Rust path, should be willing to allocate a significant effort to education and onboarding. These costs will likely reduce over time as Rust becomes more popular in production settings, but it’s unclear what that rate will be.\n\nSeveral of our services are interesting and sophisticated enough to merit more attention: player state management and matchmaking.\n\nPlayer State Management\n\nWe consider player state all the information that a game server needs to recreate the most recent game world experienced by the player. The architecture of our game is server-authoritative which means that game servers decide the state of the world and act as referees when game clients report inconsistent data (for example, because of time delay in transmission). We took this route because Palia is a social game so a player cheating or modifying their state could have a negative impact on the experience of other players. The risk of cheating is reduced when it's our system that ultimately controls player state.\n\nThe simplest way to persist state is to wait until a player exits a game server and have the server send this information to the database. Unfortunately, this makes state changes in that server vulnerable to the server itself crashing and losing that data (which is only kept in volatile memory for performance reasons). Instead, several times a second we check for player state changes, and if there are any, that data is immediately queued and sent to the database to be persisted.\n\nSpotlight: data first vs. schema first\n\nA source of contention around player state is the modeling lifecycle: who and what decides what is valid to be stored into such a state? Traditional data-modeling techniques suggest a “schema first” approach: the structure of the data (the schema) is created ahead of time and then only data that conforms to that structure can be saved into the database.\n\nThis has the advantage that the database validates the shape of the data. The disadvantage is that one has to know ahead of time the structure of the data needed… which can be challenging to coordinate across different teams.\n\nTo increase the ease with which game engineers and technical designers could work, we decided on a different model in which the structure of the data would be decided in C++ structs directly within Unreal and then marshaled and persisted in the database as a binary blob (using the Flexbuffer format). The schema is the struct declaration itself and we use Unreal’s runtime type reflection system to export the schema to our database.\n\nThe advantage of this architectural choice is that it enabled game engineers to develop features that required state persistence without the need for constant coordination. The downside is that the data is opaque to the database, which is more expensive to keep uniform and consolidated. This has required us to invest in additional tooling around the player state management system to validate, backup, modify and correct player state when it diverges from the expected structure.\n\nDespite the additional layer of development investment needed to provide hardening on top of what the database normally provides, we believe this architecture has significantly cut down the time required to deliver new features with data persistence, such as our most recent Luna New Year event.\n\nMatchmaking\n\nIn many competitive-style online games, matchmaking is the process of selecting people for a match. For Palia, matchmaking means matching the player with the game server that we believe will give players the best gameplay experience.\n\nThere are several dimensions that we take into consideration during matching:\n\nLocation - how far away the game server is from where the player is currently playing (because closer server means lower latency and lower latency means a more fluid and immersive experience)\n\nFriends - how many of the player’s friends are currently playing on that server (because the more people they know the more meaningful their interaction will be)\n\nPopulation - how many people are playing on that server (because the more people are playing the more alive the world feels)\n\nThe matchmaking system is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing us to add more signals to the matching algorithm over time if we desire.\n\nAnother crucial feature of the matchmaking system is the ability to distinguish “join” requests and “travel” requests. A join request happens when a player starts the game and wants to join. A travel request is a match required by a player leaving one map of the game and traveling to another.\n\nThe ability to distinguish the two allows us to offer priority to “travel” requests when the system is under load and there is high contention. This is because it’s far less disruptive for players to wait a few minutes to join and then wait only a few seconds to travel between maps, than one in which the delays are spread uniformly across all matching requests.\n\nThis screenshot shows a piece of the dashboard we use to monitor queue sizes and the distribution of times it takes for a matchmaking request (join or travel) to be satisfied.\n\nSpotlight: game-aware internal queueing and autoscaling\n\nEvery empty server running in the cloud without a player on it is a waste of money. On the other hand, there might be players who want to play and all of the game servers have their allocated slots filled so they would benefit from an empty server to land in.\n\nMany online games design “login queues” or similar ways to restrict the inbound flow of players and scale up or down the number of servers to meet the demand. Originally, this was our intent as well, but we realized we would benefit from a more sophisticated matchmaking design that could distinguish between joining and traveling. We also realized that the matchmaker had all the information it needed to control the size of the game server fleet.\n\nThis is how we came up with the Admiral: a component of the matchmaking system that oversees the fleet of game servers. The Admiral understands when the current fleet of game servers is insufficient to satisfy the number of players requesting a match and is able to ask the underlying cloud system (specifically Agones) to request the creation of more game server instances. Agones, on the other hand, is responsible for shutting down game servers that have been empty for some time.\n\nThe integration of autoscaling with matchmaking and the separation of concerns between the Admiral (scaling up) and Agones (scaling down) has served us very well and has managed to provide us with shock absorption to the game when things didn’t go as planned. Several times, the elasticity of these queues between maps have saved the team from having to bring down the game entirely to fix issues during misaligned deployments or unforeseen behaviors during load spikes.\n\nThis screenshot shows the view of the game servers fleet from the Admiral. Each line is really two lines: one for the “desired size” and another for the “actual size”. This information is used to tell the cloud orchestrator to spin up more game servers for a particular map type as they are needed by players being matched to servers that don’t yet exist.\n\nData Management\n\nOur architecture of loosely coupled software components wouldn’t be very useful without data flowing between them and being persisted, validated, or aggregated.\n\nDatabases\n\nOne of the most difficult elements of creating a shared perpetual world is constructing the ability for players to influence it (and one another) in a context that feels immediate and consistent. A key factor to provide a positive player experience is the choice of the database architecture.\n\nWe decided to use ScyllaDB as our main data persistence layer. ScyllaDB is a C++ rewrite of Apache Cassandra (originally created at Facebook and, in turn, heavily influenced by Google BigTable and Amazon DynamoDB), a distributed column store.\n\nThe biggest advantage of ScyllaDB for us has been its elastic scalability and its cloud native “design for failure” posture that aligned very well with ours. One significant advantage of ScyllaDB for us is the ability to attach replication strategy to a table but eventual consistency levels to a query. This gives us a lot of flexibility because in some cases we need consistency more than we need speed and we can tune that directly at the query level. This is not possible with traditional relational databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL.\n\nThis functionality is crucial, for example, when dealing with a persistent player state: we want the data to be replicated on multiple computers before we return a response to the game server. This means that both the game server and multiple database nodes have to die (at the very same time!) for that player state update to get lost. As far as we can tell, this has never happened.\n\nWe also use PostgreSQL (hosted for us by AWS) for the catalog of our outfits available for purchase in the game. We used a relational database here because we felt it was better suited for this particular job.\n\nAsynchronous Messaging\n\nAnother important part of the data management layer is the ability of software components to message one another asynchronously.\n\nWe have two of such busses:\n\nThe first for aggregates and collects telemetry for player behavior (which uses Apache Kafka, more on this later) and feeds our analytics and machine learning pipelines.\n\nAnother coordinates software components (for example, the control plane between the fleet auto-scaler and the game servers). This uses EMQX as the broker and MQTT as the protocol.\n\nWhy two? Mostly because they serve different purposes, have different strengths and weaknesses, and are managed by different teams focusing on separate outcomes. There might be value in consolidating things further in the future, but for now this separation is serving us well.\n\nSpotlight: MQTT and Apache ActiveMQ v5 (aka Artemis)\n\nThe use of MQTT as the message bus protocol for our game servers control planes was decided precisely to isolate us from lock-in of a particular broker implementation. In retrospect, this was a weak choice: MQTT is an IoT protocol and we were attracted by the fact that it was designed for devices with small power and low bandwidth. We wanted a solution that would be easy and cheap for the game servers to interact with and didn’t consume a lot of their resources.\n\nUnfortunately, many MQTT brokers simply implemented that protocol on top of their existing native systems. We picked Apache ActiveMQ v5 (aka Artemis) because it was established and it supported v5 of the MQTT protocol (which offered features we needed) but was written and designed before clouds existed and turned out to be incompatible with our preferred “loosely coupled components expected to fail” architectural posture.\n\nArtemis has been the source of much apprehension and tribulation. We ended up having to patch the software to fit our needs. We operated with a forked version in production just to keep it from falling over regularly (the MQTT layer and cross-regional federation layers did not work well together).\n\nWe have since migrated to EMQX which is a more modern MQTT broker, designed from the ground-up with MQTT in mind and we have not looked back.\n\nThe lesson learned here is that even established and battle-tested software might still end up performing poorly when utilized in a different context and with different operational constraints than was originally intended.\n\nData Pipelines\n\nAnother important principle of our software architecture is that we want to be able to observe and monitor how the system is behaving so that we can act on it effectively when behavior deviates from the norm.\n\nWe treat data differently based on whether the decision making that it supports is latency sensitive or not. In fact, we use completely different systems for low-latency decision support (seconds to minutes) vs. high-latency (days or weeks).\n\nSpotlight: player behavior vs. system behavior\n\nIn the past, we separated data based on whether it was about player behavior or software behavior. But we quickly realized that distinction was not very helpful in practice.\n\nFor example, a purchasing event from a player is technically a player behavior and insights gathered from them influence strategic decision making with high-latency (days or weeks). But such a high-latency reaction would be detrimental to both our players and our revenue if we didn’t get notified immediately if the frequency of purchases dropped outside of the normal range of operation.\n\nIt is generally true that data generated from the behavior of players influences decision making in aggregate and with high latency while events generated by the behavior of software systems influences decisions and actions that require quick reaction times. But our ability to route data based on decision making latency needs and not on the semantics of origin has made it easier to reason about data routing decisions, especially when the two pipelines are handled by different teams with different skills, strengths, and goals.\n\nObservability\n\nWe picked Prometheus as the time-series database powering the low-latency data pipeline and alerting. The key advantage here is the “pull” model in which it is Prometheus to “scrape” data from our software components, which makes it a lot simpler to maintain.\n\nWe also use Grafana as our visual dashboarding system querying the data stored in Prometheus along with Loki and Tempo to deal textual logs and tracing the flow of execution across several of our software components.\n\nLastly, we use Sloth to automate the generation of SLOs.\n\nAnalytics\n\nThe high-latency data pipeline revolves around Apache Kafka (managed for us by Confluent) which captures and routes the data as well as Apache Spark (managed for us by Databricks), which we use to aggregate and analyze the data.\n\nWe use Apache Airflow (managed for us by Astronomer) for monitoring and scheduling long-running workflows for data aggregation and analysis. Lastly, we use Tableau to power the visualization of the insights that result from our data analysis.\n\nCloud Infrastructure\n\nAnother development challenge is the “free-to-play” nature of our distribution strategy. This approach made it difficult to predict the amount of players that would play the game, especially around key events, such as platform launches, major updates, and in-game events.\n\nWe decided to be “cloud native” from the start because “elasticity” in supply of computation and bandwidth is a key advantage that cloud providers have over acquiring and maintaining our own server infrastructure; especially for gaming startups (for which capital is constrained) and when deploying across multiple geographical regions.\n\nCloud native for us didn’t simply mean: “run our programs on somebody else’s computer.” Cloud native for us meant designing a software architecture composed of small pieces that are loosely coupled and always expected to fail.\n\nWe call this “designing for failure.” Of course, we never want our systems to fail. However, we believe that resiliency in software systems comes less from preventing failure, and more from providing mitigations to such risks and the ability to restore service as quickly and automatically as possible. We want to design to reduce failure but we always expect it to happen, so when it does happen, our systems would not be surprised by it.\n\nKey components of this strategy were using Kubernetes as our orchestration system, Linkerd as our service mesh, Traefik as our load balancer and Agones to manage our fleet of game servers. We also rely heavily on the “infrastructure as code” principle, using Kustomize to help us keep our configurations DRY and ArgoCD to power continuous deployments.\n\nKubecost helps us measure costs, and we recently swapped from cluster-autoscaler to Karpenter to optimize cluster elasticity and to help pick the best server instances. This change allowed us to save a non-trivial percentage of our cloud costs by automating the selection of instance types to use to run our workloads.\n\nFor provisioning infrastructure we rely on Terraform and Spacelift. We rely on Vault to store secrets without our cloud environments. We also conduct chaos testing using Litmus.\n\nAnd we rely on a few different services for authentication and authorization systems, including FusionAuth for account management, Zendesk for customer support management, Stripe for payment processing, and Vivox for our in-game chat system.\n\nOur only cloud provider is Amazon Web Services which provides us computers, storage, and bandwidth across multiple regions: United States, Germany, and Japan. We also rely on Cloudflare for geo-aware DNS and load balancing as well as DDoS protection.\n\nSpotlight: Nomad vs. Kubernetes\n\nWe had originally chosen Nomad as our orchestration solution, mostly because it was perceived to be conceptually simpler and it was much more compatible with Windows workloads (which we thought we might need for testing purposes).\n\nUnfortunately, Nomad had one very significant problem: the momentum of the development community around it was significantly smaller than around Kubernetes. This had two significant issues for us: a) we had to develop in-house solutions that the community around Kubernetes had already implemented; and b) it was harder to engage the team with a technology that many considered an evolutionary dead-end.\n\nWe made the difficult call to switch our cloud orchestration system by using the argument that our development velocity would significantly improve and our operational risks would be reduced. This turned out to be very much the case and it’s a decision we would happily make again.\n\nBuild Systems\n\nThere are two primary concepts used in the building of Palia and its supporting services: the build platform and the build system. Historically, game studios lumped these two together around the primary continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) component. We borrowed some plays from large-scale build and release systems beyond gaming: using a heavily distributed approach inspired by some of our team members’ experiences in other industries, such as banking.\n\nTo power the build system we use Jenkins, but take care to draw a distinction between the software, and the underlying infrastructure upon which it runs and integrates. While related, these things are best served by intentional, separate configuration management and Infrastructure as Code practices which can quickly become unwieldy and complex if attempting to do so under a monolithic design. The result is a hybrid cloud approach to the build system. We use both an on-prem data center and Amazon Web Services, and one side of the architecture can be maintained without potentially negatively impacting the other.\n\nWe also took the time to redesign the initial version of the build system (Jenkins pipelines) around Unreal Engine’s native tooling, namely, BuildGraph. Doing so required a lot of work up-front as the old method was cobbled together between Jenkins Pipelines and Python scripts, but the declarative nature of BuildGraph tooling has allowed us to increase correctness, reduce build system maintenance, and increase flexibility such that we can build almost every target platform with minimal specific changes for each. A key component of this success was integrating with AutoSDK and creating a “standard library” of sorts in Jenkins to glue it all together.\n\nIn our latest version of the build platform we are able to mostly dynamically scale the number of executors based on demand. The build system can then simply act as a “glue layer” to distribute requested tasks among the available executors as parallel pipeline runs. Further, we’ve incorporated designing for Self-Service by other teams, such that they can “pick and choose” which artifacts they want built via a single interface. We call this the “Prime Pipeline,” which presents a series of configurable parameters and then schedules the running of “Sub-Pipelines” to do the work, passing those parameters as appropriate. This means that via the same Prime Pipeline interface, one Engineer could choose to build only one Platform Client from the library of Clients available, and one Server, getting only those two artifacts; or they could select everything and end up with every Client and Server we currently offer as targets.\n\nSpotlight: Capacity Management in a Hybrid Cloud World\n\nA trade-off we make for this level of granularity and distribution is the initial difficulty in managing capacity. We use several build executors of different types and had to really break-down our pipelines and how each stage would be distributed to the executors both on-prem and in AWS. Then we had to measure a single run of each pipeline to get more accurate numbers to use for calculating instance sizes, costs, expected load, and timings for stage and whole pipeline execution. This cost us a lot of time up-front, and while we are glad we did it, it is yet another piece of operational overhead which must be monitored, reviewed, and adjusted in order to remain reasonably accurate. Changing something as simple as the Node Label of a particular pipeline Stage can have serious impacts to all of the metrics we measure, most notably, build times. Unfortunately, there aren't a whole lot of “drop-in” or “off-the-shelf” solutions for these types of systems, so we have had to track these things manually, and then automate as we go to attempt to reduce the operational burden.\n\nFurthermore, managing two different sets of infrastructure is not for the faint of heart, or those unfamiliar with Hybrid Cloud management. While the patterns may be very similar, the implementation proved to be a lot more work than we anticipated.\n\nFor example, AWS and other cloud service providers make APIs available to interact on a very granular level with their exposed components. On the other end of the spectrum, even the most mature on-prem infrastructure providers rely on their own custom tooling for managing hardware components. This is why projects such as Ansible are in such heavy use in the IT industry, and S6 is no exception here as we prioritize the use of open source tools where possible to ease cognitive load and keep costs low.\n\nThe challenge that made this most difficult was the disparity in experience using this approach on our team members’ time. Some of us come from more of a Platforming background, others from a Tooling background, and still others from primarily a Jenkins Pipeline writing background. This is great for general cross-functionality within the team, but requires careful planning to execute well even among the highest-performing teams.\n\nVersion Control\n\nWe use two different version control systems to manage the development lifecycle of our code: Perforce for the game code, and git (hosted in Bitbucket) for everything else.\n\nUsing different version control systems is clearly suboptimal and not a decision we took lightly: git is generally preferred by backend engineers and is far better supported by modern development environments.\n\nUnfortunately, Perforce is very well integrated in Unreal Engine because that’s what Epic Games uses (the makers of Unreal Engine). Also, git isn’t really designed to work with very large binary files, and a lot of our in-game assets and original sources are giant binary files. Perforce works well in these situations.\n\nEarly on, we tried using git-lfs (large file storage), which is supposed to help with this problem but we gave up when we realized how much effort it would be to retrofit all of the Epic development tools (UnrealGameSync, for example) to work with git.\n\nWe sincerely wish we had a single consolidated version control system and code review workflow, but it is not a trivial exercise.\n\nSpotlight: Consolidated Repos\n\nOne of the issues we faced with git was that it was too easy and convenient to create new repositories, causing a proliferation of them. The biggest issue we faced was the inability to make changes that cross-cut different services at once. This created a lot of production overhead and reduced our ability to consolidate the behavior of services.\n\nWe considered switching to a full “monorepo” but many of us were unfamiliar with it and feared additional complexity and overhead that we had no additional development capacity to support.\n\nThe compromise we reached was a handful of consolidated repos in which many individual git repositories were merged into a single repository and then archived. All the microservices ended up in this single repository, but they could be developed, built, tested and deployed in isolation. This made it much easier to modify code across services (such as version dependencies) as well as simplifying the creation of libraries. This approach facilitated an incremental externalization of common functionality into modules that could be more easily reused across services, reducing copy/paste code duplication and reducing our maintenance costs.\n\nSaaS-y Open Source\n\nOne common theme you might have noticed in our architecture is that we prefer to depend on software that is open source and that we could host ourselves if we wanted/needed to. We also prefer to rely on a SaaS vendor that provides and manages this software for us instead of running it ourselves.\n\nThis offers us several advantages:\n\nWe are not locked into a particular cloud or vendor provider (as we could run the system ourselves if we needed to).\n\nWe can provision systems more quickly (our people don’t need to learn the intricacies of configuring them).\n\nLeverage vendor expertise to fix issues and/or edge cases when we encounter them.\n\nKeeps the vendor prices under control under our threat of shutting down our vendor contract and hosting the system ourselves.\n\nWe deviated from this posture only rarely and when there was no open source alternative that made sense for our business needs. However, we do believe this paradigm worked well for us and provides a way to fund and support further development of these open source projects. This, in turn, lowers our future risks by helping make the development of these open projects more sustainable (as these hosting vendors often employ contributors to the open source projects and continue to fund their contributions for mutually symbiotic benefit).\n\nConclusions\n\nIt’s rare to get access to the source code that makes up video games, so it’s rare to have the opportunity to learn directly from it. Even rarer is a view into the decisions and tradeoffs, the lessons learned, the paths not taken and those taken but with later regret.\n\nWe hope that this deep-dive on the challenges and successes of creating Palia’s software architecture provides some insight and inspiration for others facing similar challenges.\n\nIf you have any questions about Palia’s software architecture and development, or simply if you want to start a conversation feel free to reach out to us at hello@singularity6.com.\n\nSpecial Thanks\n\nThe list of people that contributed to this architecture is very long (see the Palia credits for the full list) and we wouldn’t do it justice to replicate it here.

      "# [Sixer Game Night 2024: A Night of Neon, Nostalgia, And Non](https://www.singularity6.com/news/sixer-game-night-2024)\nLast week, the Palian moons aligned for Sixers who participated in Sixer Game Night, an epic soirée where Singularity 6 stormed arcades in LA, Seattle, Chicago, and Las Vegas. The vibe was electric as the team gathered to celebrate our love for games, both digital and analog.\n\nThe festivities kicked off with a culinary homage to our childhood favorites. The menu was a mouthwatering spread of comfort food classics: pigs-in-a-blankey, chicken tendies, yummy sliders, mountains of crispy truffle fries, and fruit to stave off scurvy (Arrr!). And what's a Game Night without a few libations to toast our collective camaraderie of creativity?\n\nIt wouldn’t be a Sixer celebration without a lil’ Karaoke; that age-old tradition of belting out tunes with the confidence of Vanilla Ice (regardless of actual singing ability, of course). Several Sixers grabbed (and dropped!) the mic, belting out ballads known and niche. Several smart watches warned against heightened decibel levels. But “In The End,” “I Want It That Way.”\n\nOf course, Singularity 6 is a video game studio, and it’s the arcade where Sixers truly shined. The simulated dance battles were fierce, with team members stepping, hopping, and jumping in a mesmerizing dance of rhythm and coordination-ish. And the kart races were a sight to behold, with friendly rivalries emerging as racers chucked red, green, and blue (!!!) shells across the track for several photo-finish victories (to most folks’ chagrin). A surprise fishing game left us ‘reeling’ after reeling-in some outrageously-sized Tuna. And let's not forget the claw machine – a test of patience and precision as Sixers collected an army of ducks that now embellish several studio workspaces.\n\nBut beyond the games, the laughter, and the sheer joy of human connection; Sixer Game Night was a reflection of what makes Singularity 6 so special. It's the people – our team – who bring their passion, creativity, and enthusiasm to everything we do, whether it's crafting Palia’s next big feature, or quacking about their latest toy waterfowl.\n\nAs the night wound down and we said our goodbyes, it was clear that Game Night wasn't just about playing games. It was about building memories, strengthening bonds, and celebrating the incredible community that is Singularity 6. Here's to many more nights of neon, nostalgia, and nonstop fun.",
      "# [Meet Our Environment Artist, Maya](https://www.singularity6.com/news/meet-our-environment-artist-maya)\nAs Sixers, we like to showcase our small, yet mighty team and highlight their amazing abilities. This month, we’re introducing a few of our employees who are hard at work making our dream for a virtual society happen.\n\nMaya Mahalingam\n\nMaya joined S6 last year as our Environment Artist. She has a strong passion for art and was encouraged early on to explore these skills. Check out her work on ArtStation!\n\nGet to know Maya by reading our conversation with Maya below!\n\nHow did you get started in this profession and what drew you to a career as an artist (no pun intended)?\n\nI have been super passionate about art ever since as a kid, and I loved to draw and paint. I was always very sure that I wanted to pursue a creative career and do something different, so I did a Visual communication bachelors to figure out where my interest was. During my childhood, I remember playing a lot of GTA and NES games after school which fueled my curiosity even more. And so, I ended up working as an artist at a mobile game company and I really enjoyed the experience. I kept up to date on trends and looking into tools that are constantly changing in the 3D space and became super interested in VR. So, I came to the US to further my career and expand my knowledge by doing a Game Dev program at Carnegie Mellon. Since then, I've had the opportunity to work with multiple teams across games, VR and AR space for the past few years.\n\nWhen you were younger, how did you discover a passion for art?\n\nWhen I was growing up, I played tennis professionally for a while and art was like my side interest due to lack of time. But I still enjoyed going to art classes a lot. My parents really encouraged me to explore my creativity and I started painting and doodling whenever I could.\n\nWhat excites you most about being an Environment Artist?\n\nWhat I really like about environment art is that I get to translate my real world observations and bring them to life directly. And, the other nice thing about being an environment artist specifically is that I get to touch a lot of topics in the pipeline, be it technical or purely art itself because of the nature of the role. That I think widens my knowledge and interest of continuing to learn and grow. Also, I've found a recent love to write and share the process about my work and here's my last one: https://80.lv/articles/001agt-005cg-crafting-a-mossy-oakwood-forest-in-ue4-at-cgma/. I wish to continue to do more of that through personal work and our game here at S6.\n\nWhat brought you to LA / S6?\n\nIt was a combination of my interest in environment art, and looking to relocate to LA for personal reasons. So S6 was a great opportunity to be able to do both. I wanted to try something new and different after having worked in VR/AR projects, I wanted to work on a project where I could create a vibrant virtual environment that the players could spend hours exploring and having fun.\n\nWhat have you learned about yourself since becoming an artist?\n\nI think over the years I've learnt how much I can push myself to face challenges and try out new things. I've become more comfortable with accepting what I don't know and what I can do to fix that. And, definitely to be a good person, because at the end of day I think that's what counts.\n\nWhat things in life are still a mystery to you?\n\nHaha the question itself is a big mystery to me. Honestly, I see myself as a mystery because I'm still constantly trying to figure out my traits, my interests and where I'm heading towards in life. So, having to learn about myself and finding solutions for the questions in my head has been really interesting so far.\n\nOf the many things you do, which one makes your heart beat the fastest?\n\nArt! I think if you make something that you enjoy and if it’s something that people find fascinating then that's something to work on with pride.\n\nWhat are you currently working on, without giving anything away?\n\nCurrently I'm working on getting the different aspects of environment art as close to the art bible as possible. And, I’m working on getting Houdini engine setup for some procedural modeling integrated into our pipeline for customizable options in game.\n\nWhat is the one thing in life that makes you happiest?\n\nFirst thing that comes to mind is good food, especially dessert! I can literally eat a Tiramisu or a cake any time. If I am not eating a cake then I am probably baking or thinking about one :D\n\nFor aspiring kids who want to be an artist/designer one day, what advice would you give them?\n\nI would say following your passion is what brings the best out of you. Other than that if it has to be specific to becoming an artist, I would say keep yourself updated constantly. Train yourself to be in a position to be super adaptable to whichever tools become the standard. The industry changes constantly, so having a lot of self discipline and motivation I think is very important. And to make some time to work on personal projects cause I think that really helps to shine a light on your interest.",

      "# [Finding Home: Social Matchmaking Through Machine Learning](https://www.singularity6.com/news/finding-home-social-matchmaking-through-machine-learning)\nI grew up in a small town - so small that it technically qualifies as a village. To describe this to others, I quote my father’s favorite fact: “there are thirty times more cows here than there are people.” Depending on who you are, that may or may not sound appealing. Yet, another aspect of this community was more universally captivating - the feeling of being in a place where you truly belong.\n\nAs my education and career progressed, I made my way up the chain from cities to the dog-eat-dog world of metropolises. With each move, that strong sense of community support and inclusion in my hometown slowly faded away. It was easy to get lost in the millions in these larger places and feel like another number.\n\nOnline user bases, such as those present in video games, can quickly reach a population in the tens to hundreds of millions, surpassing the largest cities’ size. One of our goals at Singularity 6 is to create a world that brings us closer together, not further apart, which makes solving the large-scale problem of “community” vital to us.\n\n\"How do we design a social experience for millions of players while also connecting them in meaningful ways?\"\n\nIn video games, the exploration of in-depth algorithmic solutions to optimize the social experience remains limited. However, the problem has not gone entirely untouched, as many social media platforms leverage services with machine learning components to solve similar problems. With a few modifications, these systems should work in the gaming space as well.\n\nFor example, link prediction, the problem of predicting a link between two entities in a network, is a standard tool for increasing connectedness in networks; if a system can accurately assist a user in finding relevant acquaintances, their likelihood of continuing to use the service increases. Unfortunately, the problem is somewhat different and more difficult in the gaming space; players are often anonymous and, if playing socially, generally choose to play with an explicit group of friends. In other words, the connectedness of the entire player graph is sparse compared to an average network.\n\nIn this case, the problem is partially about predicting those existing relationships and more about curating new ones. Can we learn the interactions that create a positive perception of other players? Can we incentivize our system to reinforce those positive interactions by increasing the chance that those players will meet again soon? With time, we can ensure that each player is automatically added to the best community for them when returning to the game.\n\n\"The problem is partially about predicting those existing relationships and more about curating new one.\"\n\nWhile that task itself may sound daunting, there is good news on the business front. For some social apps (i.e., dating), a conflict arises with exactly how good a matchmaking service should be. If you build a well-optimized matchmaking service, it may hinder user retention, and if you throw together a scrappy solution, you may not get users in the first place. For social gaming, this trade-off between user experience and business performance is mostly absent. Without that tension, we can build a high-quality matchmaking service that will strengthen player bonds and impact the business in a meaningful way. Finding win-wins such as this is a motivating force for everyone here at Singularity 6.\n\nFor me, I hope to rekindle that sense of community I lost long ago and share that experience with others. I want to help build that safe, secure space that anyone can go to when they feel alone or when the world is a bit too chaotic. I invite you to follow Singularity 6 on this journey, the best one of all, the one of finding home.\n\n-Riley Howsden, Machine Learning",

Everyone is free to play any game they like - some play board games like Race for the Galaxy, Root, or Riichi Mahjong - others play action games like Overwatch, Among Us, or Deep Rock Galactic.\n\nGaming hour is great for letting people interact with co-workers they might not work with regularly\n\nDiscord is great for coordinating game nights, as well as sharing plenty of pictures of professional model and goodest of boys, Mochi.\n\nGaming hour is our opportunity to relax and unwind, but it's also an opportunity to interact and connect with our coworkers outside of typical work functions. You can get to know a person by playing together, be it overcoming game obstacles or engaging in friendly competition. Gaming hour is great for letting people interact with co-workers they might not work with regularly, letting them get to know people outside of their immediate team. It’s also an opportunity to discover games we might not otherwise have tried, and expands our knowledge of the gaming world while having fun.\n\nGiven the current pandemic that has us all working from home, having activities that bring us together gives us opportunities to interact. Gaming hour gives people a reason to get into voice chat and socialize on a regular basis. Since gaming hour is an official company event, people can participate without feeling guilty for taking time away from work - it’s part of our schedule because we believe that playing games together is a worthwhile, meaningful pursuit.",

      "# [We are Singularity 6!](https://www.singularity6.com/news/we-are-singularity-6)\nWe are Singularity 6 and we believe games are more than just simple entertainment.\n\nVideo games have ignited our creativity, connected us to broader communities, and helped us forge lifelong friendships. If you’re reading this, chances are some of your best memories have been made with either a keyboard and mouse or a controller in hand.\n\nWhen they’re at their best, games unite us and help us create shared and impactful memories.\n\n“When I was growing up, my grandmother was such a titanic figure in my life, in part because of the game experiences we shared together.” Game Director Aidan Karabaich explains, “whether it was her besting me at Pac-Man for the 100th time or reveling in a new NES game we were trying to beat together for the first time, games brought us together in a way no other medium could.”\n\nMeaningful experiences, like Aidan’s, have been a part of all our stories here at Singularity 6. Games have played such a crucial part in our lives that we wove our love for them, and for what they could be, into the very core of our studio. Our mission is to forge alternate worlds that deepen players’ lives.\n\nFor a little over three years, we have been recruiting industry veterans who share this ambitious mission. Today, our team includes top talent with experience at big studios like Blizzard Entertainment, Epic Games, and Riot Games; among others. Although many of us have never met face to face due to the pandemic, we have been playing games to connect and build bonds with one another. This has further demonstrated to us the importance of games that help connect people all over the world, and strengthened our commitment to creating these experiences for others.\n\nWith the announcement of Palia, we are on the path to making our vision a reality. Palia is a community simulation MMO set in a high fantasy world. This cozy world invites you to build a life possible only in your dreams while making new friends along the way. You can learn more about the game here.\n\n“Palia creates a lot of opportunities to bring players together and that’s one of the things I’m looking forward to the most,” says Community Lead Edaleen Cruz. “I can’t wait to hear all those stories about friendships that began in Palia.”\n\nGames can help us live life twice as good and if that resonates with you, we invite you to join us on this adventure.",

I've played this game almost 100 hours now and while I did enjoy playing it I probably won't play for much longer. Once I got to Exquisite Level Tools it got unplayable for me personally. I am extremely introverted and I like solo playing games. I don't like talking in game chat and will do everything I can to avoid it so once you reach the stage where you need an insane amount of Flow Wood Planks then I can't really enjoy playing anymore. I don't want to have to constantly call out for help to grind flow trees that are uncuttable without a group to make cute furniture. Clothes cost ~$30 or more a set, pets are something like $15 and you can't get them any other way but through the premium shop. Crops take at least 3 hours of real time to grow with watering in between and if they aren't watered their growth pauses so no planting and logging back in later to collect. Takes an hour to process a single crop to increase it's value and you're limited to 9 plots of soil (9 plots w/ 9 spaces so 81 crops total) so you can't really grind crops for money quickly. There is also no way to trade other players or give things away to another person. You can make a request for an item you've already obtained but not one you haven't gotten yourself before and you can't ask a specific person to fill the request. Overall it's cute and a fun game to kill some time but I don't want to be forced to interact with people just to continue playing.",

There's so much to do and it's really addicting, the world feels vibrant and beautiful, and I really love the characters as well! Jel has definitely stolen my heart though. ♥ The community is also quite friendly and helpful, which is really nice to see! ♥ I haven't done much socialising though and can comfortably play the game solo or with my partner. Cosmetics like outfits and skins are monetised which kinda sucks but all the rest of the content is free, plus there is more to come as the devs keep working on improving the game. It can be a bit buggy sometimes but it hasn't turned me away from the gameplay at all, in fact, it's hard to stop. I am writing this at 3 am and I really really need to go to sleep but as soon as I wake up I will probably jump right back to it because it's my current hyperfixation. And also I need to talk to Jel. I always need to talk to Jel. Comfort game go brrrr.",

I feel like a game needs more than just gather resources, use resources and do fetch quests for boring NPCs. To me it feels like a mobile game on PC.\r\n\r\nI guess if you like to build a house, this game is OK, but even then there are games that have much better base building AND have a lot more to do otherwise. I would give it a 3/10 - there's nothing that makes you want to continue playing the game. If nothing interesting happens during the first 5 hours of a game, i feel like it's already lacking. There's no incentive to keep playing, it feels like 1/4 of a game.",

You can play solo or get to know others and do activities together.\n\nIt shines in the art of home design, perfect for those who delight in crafting beautiful spaces.\n\nYou must know, this may be repetitive for some with its grinding mechanics. You will have to decide if it’s your thing or not, but the game is free and there aren’t any imbalances between players. You only buy cosmetics that do not influence game progression.\n\nIt has its own Wiki in case you find it hard to understand what to do, and the community is pretty helpful as well. Just ask your questions in chat, and they'll guide you.\n\n[h3] [u] It's unfinished, so it's not perfect, but it's still pretty good. [/u] [/h3]\n\nOccasionally buggy, loot can sometimes get stuck in the ground, which can be annoying. This happened to me while I was trying to catch a Rainbow-Tipped Butterfly, if I remember correctly. I spent a long time searching for it, only to find it stuck and unavailable for pickup afterward.\n\nI don't find certain puzzles in the story quests engaging; they could use some improvements, but it's not enough to make me stop playing.\n\nYour character moves rather oddly at times, especially when running short distances or climbing. These areas could benefit from some visual and physics enhancements.\n\nAnd a few other quirks scattered about.\n\n[b] I played Palia before it was on Steam, so I have more hours invested than it shows here. I've completed most of the available content. I believe it has great potential. [/b]\n\n7/10 for now.",

Very annoying bugs that have been around for many updates. Little to no communication from developers acknowledging these issues or providing patches.",
      "https://steam/76561198002973871": "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-20)](https://steam/76561198002973871)\nThis game fails to deliver on it's genre.\nI would have rather paid like 25 bucks for the game instead of it being free if it made all the difference in quality.\n\nThe graphics are less that sub par using the bland washed out cartoon breath of the wild or genshin impact style, except theres no cell shading or graphical effects. The sky doesnt even have any effects for the sun or clouds. The sky is just a blank dome with a 2D image of 4 clouds that rotate on an axis 24 hours a day indefinitely. The skybox is also a low resolution texture of a mountain that you can see the rough pixel edges of without even zooming in. There are no weather effects. You don't get season changes, rain, snow, fog, anything like that.\n\nCrafting is less than rewarding. Your tools have durability and break, upgrading them costs a fortune and hardly make a difference. For example, upgrading a pick axe still requires the same number of hits to destroy rocks because it goes by damage instead of gathering time. Crafting is automated by machines that you are limited by inventory space and time to use.\n\nThe game is also severely lacking in content and full of nearly game breaking bugs, including tools failing to equip, broken animation loops, and quest descriptions that stick and overwrite newer quest descriptions. These are just a tiny few of the bugs.\n\nBug catching is a nightmare. instead of using a net, you have to forage and craft these items that copied pokemon pokeballs, which all have a small chance of successfully capturing the bugs. you can often throw up to 6 or even 8 of these at a single bug and still not catch it. The bugs dont even sell for enough money to pay for the materials used to capture said bugs.\n\nThe NPCs personalities are all very dry and you cannot actually have conversations with them, you are able to interact with them less than you can NPCs in a game like skyrim. They only talk to you when you want to, and its on par with the characters from Animal Crossing.\n\nIn fact everything in this game feels like a cheapened imitation of Animal Crossing, you roam around collecting or trying to grind for things to make pennies on the thousands of dollars it takes to upgrade your house space. Everything is time gated. There is hardly any content in the game at all, there are no big areas to explore, no combat, no dungeons with treasure, and not even any tools to socialize or express yourself with other players.\n\nThat is probably where the game drops the ball the hardest is with player interaction. There are very few clothing options in the game and they all look the same and have some kind of paisley pattern you cannot get rid of. (Paisley is the kind of pattern you find on bandannas irl.) They also want you to spend upwards of 16 to 30 dollars on a single outfit which are mostly comprised of just a shirt and pants. You cannot layer clothing, accessorize, paint or dye your clothing, its either you get it the way it is from the shop and thats it. There are also no players interacting or having conversations in town. They're all just grinding out resources and money. This is probably because theres no chat bubbles, chat console hides itself so you cannot even casually read server chat, and there arent ways to engage or hang out with nearby players. You cannot even sit on furniture in the town, much less go down to the tavern in the game and have a meal with your friends, even though there is a tavern. The character animations are very stiff and robotic, from the idle, running...and thats really the only animations your characters do. They dont really seem alive. They don't stretch, yawn, look around, or transition into other animations well at all. When you go from a hard sprint into standing again, theres about 3 frames inbetween, it looks about at rough as T-posing.\n\nThe housing system. This is the big one, probably the only part of the game where most of the budget went into. You can tell they tried to put some effort into this but its still roughly designed and not executed well. For example, you can build walls for your house so its not just one big room, the walls only go halfway up to the ceiling, you can place a wall near the ceiling instead and leave a gap near the floor big enough for you to walk through, but you cannot stack two walls on top of eachother because the ceiling height is exactly one grid space lower than the height of 2 wall pieces. so you cannot build rooms in your home.If you try to make them overlap instead, there is a massive space between the layers. Containers are cosmetic only and non-functional, you also cannot put furniture wherever you want. Want to put a flower pot on top of your dresser? you can't. Want to put up wallpaper? only for the bottom half of the wall. Want to hang things from the ceiling? you can't. Want to add a window in the corner? you can't. Want to change the walls of your house or the shape of them to not just be a big cube? you can't. Want to have a flower garden? you can't. Fireplace? no. Cupboard with items? no. You cannot do anything detailed with your house leaving it forced to look unlived in, cobbwebbs would look more believable at home in your house than a person living there.\n\nGames that did housing better than Palia and arent even life sim games: Black Desert, Elder scrolls online, Animal Crossing, Minecraft, 7 Days to Die, Raft, Craftopia, Legends of Aria, Phantasy Star Online 2.\n\nIn summary, Nothing this game has as a feature really feels in depth or immersive. You cannot specialize in a field of crafting, theres not even that many things to craft, player interaction just isnt even there (not even for roleplay.)\n\nIf i had to come up with an analogy for this game, its being thirsty and trying to enjoy a glass of water, but the cup is like 90% ice and you're constantly slurping and shaking the glass and waiting for the ice to melt to get a tiny sip and just give up and walk away thirsty when theres a full glass of water for FREE around any other corner.",

I would say this is the easiest way to make money, which you need for EVERYTHING. Want to make your house bigger - money, Want to make your tools better - money. Decorations, plot size, machinery permits, you have to pay money for everything. However the grind doesnt get easier as you progress in the game. You still have only hunting, fishing and mining. Doesnt get much faster, easier or less boring. I find it is normal thing in the begining of game to grind, but there should be oportunity to use machinery to make money later. Also procesed materials should cost more than raw materials, thats just logic. Not in this game!",

This review is personal yet vague enough and sorry I am not going to go into the \"whys\" of some of this review as it's again personal stuff. Just simply, my own review. This most likely will change in the future as the game develops more...\nAnyhow, okay, time for my weird and honest review:\n\n1., I love this game. It is quite addicting. It reminds me of a mixture of games, including a much older game that I grew up with that unfortunately has been shut down long when I was still young. Seeing a game with a similar-ish style and playstyle really allows me to get into this game. To me, I'd say the games are close enough and may even get more similar things added!\n\n2. Relaxing. Very relaxing. I like building games like these where you build your life from the ground up. \n\n3.  I am epileptic along with other things. And can I just say how much I ADORE there for once being a warning something???\nNot just a warning, but a warning that gives you useful ideas and instructions and really just encourages being healthy and safe! Just having a warning there to begin with really puts me at ease and shows that they care. I've talked to devs that have pretty much told epileptics \"oh, sucks to be you. Why should we cater for you?\" and that can make the world honestly feel even more lonely. I mean I get there is a whole debate that could happen right now from what I am about to say, but hey, why not just put a quick warning in your games? Like how hard is that? Or just not be lazy and make decent lighting...\nBut, I am not here to complain. I LIKE THIS GAME BECAUSE THEY TRY TO MAKE IT A GAME EVERYONE CAN ENJOY. And for the photosensitivity stuff, I give this game an A+ from me.\nBy the way,\nI have seen some *weird* stuff flash in and out in the game, but that's really just new game bugs that sometimes just aren't preventable. As for ME, I find the game's lighting and sensitivities and all to be pretty okay. I can't speak for everyone who is photosensitive, but I can say for myself the game is fairly good with that. The character creation screen *may* be sensitive to some, so just make sure to look or keep turned away away at the start of that during the dialogue until it is over.\nSeriously though, thanks for adding this.\n\n4. Einar asked how my day was, I was having a bad day and said so ingame to him, and he gave me a shiny rock to make me feel better. That actually made my day a bit better. Thanks.\n\n5. Unfortunately (due to the next thing), I can't get too much into the lore, but I wish I could. This game is full of diverse characters and quests. I love the worldbuilding and CHARACTER BUILDING especially that the devs put into this game! Very nicely done and not at all unnoticed!\n\n(the next one is a bit personal and super weird and specific and for summary, is just me blabbing about how much I dislike the game shoving humanity down my throat. So if that confuses you, just skip it)\n6., \n[spoiler]Personally I really dislike how much into humanity this game goes. I haven't fully played the quest and keep skipping the dialogue as I am someone who cannot connect to humanity in the slightest. With a game with humanoids and robots, and I am STUCK as a human in a fantasy world, I find it incredibly discouraging. If it has lore like this game, I'd want a game that focuses more on BEING AN INDIVIDUAL and not humanity. Playing as a human is overused and I really can't connect or even care about the plot because it's so centered around humanity and is constantly down your throat about it. Again I understand this is a weird opinion, but I prefer the idea of focusing more on building an individual than clumping them with a species or whatever. Especially in a game that's meant to be an escape from reality. I don't want to be a human in fantasy, why would I want that? I don't want connection to the real world at all when I play games. I like escape. Helps dysphoria a lot and helps with stress---which is WHY I like games like this. Just none that are exactly like this game exist where I can play as a freaking robot or monster or even just a humanoid/inhuman thing (just stating for context, I mean more I'd be down for playing as one of the robots or something like that). I think this game could work on that, but again this is very much a personal addition to my review and simply something I more hope the devs see, probs not but who knows. Just saying, even like just a skin or removing the characters CONSTANTLY shoving humanity down my throat every chance they have would make this game PERFECT for me. Seriously, I can't stand the dialogue because all it does is talk about a topic I am already big no about.[/spoiler] \n\n----\nWhile I understand thew devs have their own visions and for all I know my own visions could be colliding with what this game is all about, I just wanted to state it. Again, maybe any complains from I or anyone will be seen and something will be added to accommodate. I mean heck, if they are by some miracle taking inspiration off of my all-time favourite game, they may add different formes you can become like skins or spells or something for at least the human problem. Again, it's still in beta so it's whatever. I still love the game and want to support it, even if my brain at the moment may not agree with it. (sorry)\n\nAnyhow, devs, keep up the great game",

      "https://steam/76561198146032683": "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-15)](https://steam/76561198146032683)\nI've played the game for awhile now but... I still can't decide whether it's a good game or not. Surely Palia has many activities and skills to improve, radiant graphics and more or less big world. The NPC are cute too.\nBut... It lack of something... I've tried to analyze it and I've came to this list:\n1. Lack of color. \nIt's maybe funny, but Palia, despite of all the cozy landscapes, are mostly in two colors. Green, blue, a little bit of orange. That's all. No more differences. All tree leaves (except the said orange ones) are green. All grass are green. Flowers are rare and hard to notice. I need more colors! More contrast! It's a forest after all, where all the beauty?\n2. The claustrophobia thing. \nYour house is located in a place surrounded by fence, by the forest AND by the mountains! Even location outside the city surrounded by the mountains! I know devs are trying to locate the end of the map by that, but PLEASE find another way, it making me sick by all this height above me! You could've add ocean, cliffs, I don't know, CANYONS, but all you choose is rocks. Booriiing! (Oh yeah sorry, forgot about one ocean in one part of the city, my dearest apologies)\n3. Maybe lack of realism.\nYou don't need to sleep, you don't need to eat, you even don't have any health bar. Wolfs are running from you, the night is as bright as a day, I didn't even notice any light sources. What's that, a child game? MAYBE, but no child game are providing killing animals with arrows and harvesting MEAT from it. Even if you try to disguise it with a bag, haha, you think children are stupid? Give adult people more hardcore, I want to feel the game and my character, not just run all day by some created 3D model that has no limits! Even Minecraft has limits (hunger it is)! \n\nIn the end, the game maaaaybe good to relax, but it doesn't provide anything more. You just need to run all day ('cause you don't need to sleep), harvest everything you can and do the quests. Which there a LOT. It feels like I'm on a job and have to work day, and day, and day, and day. The difference is that I receive money by that and here I receive only more quests :D I'm scared to even open my journal, cause it filled by them, but Palia is always reminding me about my job by showing all the quests in a right side of my monitor. It's scary... \n\nLong story short, it's a game about countless hours of run errands and visibility of freedom. If you tired of doing your real job, you can change it by doing virtual job! Thrilling, isn't it? If you like that assignment, please buy Palia! Otherwise, make your decision by more relaxing games.",

      "https://steam/76561199244176862": "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-16)](https://steam/76561199244176862)\nRating: 5/5\n\nOverview: Palia is a cozy, community-based MMO developed by Singularity 6, blending elements of life simulation and traditional MMORPG gameplay in a relaxing, laid-back environment. It offers an escape from the combat-heavy, fast-paced MMOs and instead focuses on activities like farming, fishing, crafting, and socializing. The game’s whimsical art style, charming world, and emphasis on collaboration over competition set it apart in a genre dominated by high-octane action.\n\nVisuals and Atmosphere: One of the strongest aspects of Palia is its visual presentation. The art style is bright, colorful, and reminiscent of Ghibli films, with lush forests, tranquil lakes, and detailed towns. The characters and environments are beautifully crafted, giving the game a whimsical, warm aesthetic that draws players in. The soundtrack complements this atmosphere perfectly, with gentle, calming music that helps maintain the relaxed pace.\n\nGameplay: Palia centers around life skills such as cooking, farming, fishing, and crafting. The game doesn't focus on combat or conflict, making it a relaxing experience for those looking for a more casual MMO. Players work together to build homes, gather resources, and complete quests that encourage collaboration rather than competition.\n\nThe progression system feels rewarding without being grindy. As players improve their skills, they unlock new recipes, tools, and customization options. The crafting and farming systems are intuitive, and the world provides ample opportunities to explore, gather resources, and discover new areas. However, after several hours, some players may find the gameplay loops repetitive, especially those who are accustomed to more complex MMOs.\n\nCommunity and Social Features: Palia shines in its social aspect. It encourages players to form friendships and work together on large projects. Community events and co-op activities foster a sense of belonging, and the world is designed to be a shared experience. Players can visit each other’s homes, help with crafting or farming, and participate in large-scale events.\n\nThere’s also an emphasis on NPC interactions, with a rich cast of characters to befriend. The dialogue and relationship-building mechanics are engaging, and the NPCs have distinct personalities that make interactions feel meaningful. Romanceable NPCs add a layer of depth, though the relationship system is still somewhat basic in its current form.\n\nRoom for Improvement: Despite its charm, Palia isn’t without its flaws. The game could benefit from more content diversity. After mastering the available skills, there’s a lack of end-game content, which could make long-term play feel stagnant. Adding new activities, quests, and crafting options would help sustain interest over time.\n\nAdditionally, while the game runs smoothly for the most part, there are occasional bugs and glitches, such as resource spawn issues or server hiccups, which can disrupt gameplay. The developers have been responsive to feedback, so future updates may address these concerns.\n\nConclusion: Palia is a refreshing, tranquil take on the MMO genre, providing a peaceful, non-combat experience that’s perfect for players seeking a slower-paced, community-driven game. Its cozy aesthetic, focus on social interaction, and simple yet engaging gameplay mechanics make it a joy to play, especially for fans of life simulation games. While it lacks some depth in terms of end-game content, and there’s room for expansion, Palia is a promising and delightful entry into the genre.\n\nIf you're looking for an MMO that’s more about building friendships and relaxing than grinding levels or fighting bosses, Palia is worth checking out.",

      "https://steam/76561198107467511": "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-24)](https://steam/76561198107467511)\nWhile I've been having fun playing this game solo (ignoring the bugs and crashes), I can't give it a thumbs up. \nTheir marketing team/board members decided to implement some scummy tactics like MACRO transactions, and purchasing a in-game currency, as well as forcing you to buy more of that currency than you need, so you always end up paying more. \n\nFor a game that isn't even finished, this is insane. I wouldn't mind spending like 5eur on a skin, but 40 eur for one outfit or 10 eur for a pet is absolutely insane. Blocking players from earning anything themselves in terms of cosmetics is a major major downside and really greedy. Animal crossing does this in a much better way. \n\nI would much rather spend 40 euros once to buy the game than spend thousands just trying to buy the cosmetics. That's some EA garbage right there. And its sad because you can see the writers and artists and devs did put a lot of effort into making a cute game.\n\nThe multiplayer part also feels very half-a$sed. Yes, theres a chat and you see players running around. You can group up with a friend and see their location. But that's about it. No quest sync, no trading with friends, no mailing friends items, no dungeons or group content, you can't see each other when you're in a temple,  you can't even plant seeds for a friend. what is the point? It seems like the MMO part is just a marketing buzzword. It's about as multiplayer as elden ring is.",

How is one supposed to have a wholesome farm experience without any horses? \n\n2. The cooking mini game is the most boring and unsatisfying one i've seen in a game. I wish they'd take notes from Immortal Life, or Kynseed.\n\n3. The quests are few and far between. The world isn't living with no quests.\n\n4. The devs get no profit from designing interesting quests, or writing deep characters. All their profit comes from selling cosmetics on their immersion-breaking store for a lot of money. \n\nUnless they add some subscription option, I don't expect any quality content to be created. \n\nMore on that:\nThis game was marketed as wholesome and cozy, with healthy practices. The devs seemed like there was actually some love in the project, and were interested in making a good game for a wholesome, cozy experience. \n\nThe first red flag was the \"free to play\". No option was even offered to players to buy the game at a fair price, and/or opt to pay for a subscription and then enjoy a complete, immersive world without FOMO, tricks, predatory and stressful microtransactions, and the constant reminder of greed breathing down your neck.\n\nThe game doesn't feel wholesome. It feels superficial, and put together for the sole purpose of greed. The microtransactions are integrated in the game, in a way that kills any immersion or wholesomeness one could hope to find in a fantasy world. \n\nI haven't followed the whole drama, but i did see the trailers and marketing prior to releasing the beta, and trying out the game a year later, it was difficult to imagine that the game in that was marketed was this game i was experiencing. From what I read other people saying online, there's been a lot of drama during that year i missed. Many people blame Palia's devs for lies, unmet promises and a clear indication that this is not the wholesome feel-good game it was marketed to be, just another greedy game with no love in the making whatsoever. \n\nI guess we'll have to wait a little longer for the real deal. Too bad.",

It definitely still has stuff to improve and bugs to be fixed, but the game play style alongside an engaging story that gives you the freedom to progress at your own pace and the social/collaborative nature of the game with fellow members of the server makes those \"negatives\" almost insignificant.\r\n\r\n If I had to ask for something it would be to give us creative freedom in certain aspects of decoration positioning which might sound like asking too much given the magnitude of improvements that can already be done to our plot. However sometimes the limitations on where an object can be placed or not inside the grid, or the lack of angles, or objects not interacting well with the surroundings do cut us short from the cozy building experience.  It would also be great if we could move the mail box and selling container to anywhere in the plot as it is a bit annoying not been able to change the way the entrance looks.\r\n\r\nWhen playing in a party with a friend, it is often that we lose sight of each other and our friend's character seems to disappear as we run around. The same way our character disappears from our friend's perspective and can result to be confusing as we try to follow each other. There is a serious need of a mini map as well! Having to rely on clicking M to open the big map limits our ability to keep moving as we locate a place. \r\n\r\nOverall the game is super fun whether you have friends to play with or not. The online open multiplayer server allows you to chat with others, ask for help, request needed items for quests or personal use, create a community and make new friends as you discover all the secrets hiding in Palia! Don't let the need for minor fixes in a game that is still in development discourage you from having a wonderful time! The game is totally worth the hype!",

In fact the writing for some of the NPC stories is absolutely brilliant, as is the animation for certain characters and their body language (all of the NPCs feel well written and well fleshed out, they all have motivations and solid backstories, it's really good in most cases).\r\n\r\nThere is a certain level of grinding (chop trees, mine rocks, grow crops) but it's on the level of Stardew and it's easy to know what to do. The in-game community is generally friendly and will help out with problems, questions, fetch-quests and so on. A few quests are not very clear about what you need to do at certain points, but again the community will help if they can, and there's a good wiki online with pointers.\r\n\r\nIt needs some polishing, but there's content updates ongoing and it feels like a game that should be brilliant by the time it hits full release.",

This is one of the most co-operative games I've ever played with quests, gathering, and cooking encouraging you to play with others to enjoy bonuses for everyone.

There are a lot of great new changes mostly revolving around the game being more friendly to get rare resources. \n\nThere is loads of things to do and to grind for, with a huge focus on community and player friendship. Over the year there still aren't many \"new\" things to do or new zones which does mean that the game gets stale still a year later after playing it for a week or so in a row.\n\nOne thing that's a really big negative that almost made me change my review is that there are a lot of community rules that aren't stated anywhere other than in the brains of the people who follow them and/or have played long enough to know them, Not knowing these rules such as Cutting flow tree groves at 3am in game time caused a large argument on the server today with me cutting too early, I did not know and wasn't told but broke some scared rule that caused a player to hurl abuse at me over chat for 20 mins. \n\nIf the community is going to create rules that are expected to be followed the developers should perhaps put these into the in game loading screens or tool-tips once they become expected. \n\nI've had these negative experiences with more players then I'd expect to for a game that at it's core is a \"Cozy MMO\".\n\nOther then this the game is really nice and the community as a whole has be wonderful.",

Everything from the world to the characters, graphics and story is so well done. Gameplay provides plenty of variety. You can collect insects, do combat, or focus on gathering and building if you so please, something that I've wished more games like this would offer. You can even build friendships and romance the other characters. This game truly has it all. Not a huge fan of having to pay for cosmetics and skins rather than earning them though. The one major gripe that I have with the game however, is the fact that it's online only. As others have said, this game really doesn't feel like it should be a multiplayer game. The servers don't seem to be too populated and the socialization between other players is nearly nonexistent aside from a few people sharing tips here and there. I think it would've been a better idea to make the game singeplayer and give those who wish to play with others the ability to create a server that others can join, similar to Palworld and Genshin, that way players don't have to rely on being connected to wifi to be able to play. The game truly doesn't need to be multiplayer in my opinion. Aside from that though, it would also be nice to have the ability to sit in chairs and benches as others have said.",

You can collect plushies, and all the star quality fish, bugs, and starstones to display in your house for others to see. The community of players are super friendly and helpful to those who are new to the game. And I love how Palia implements the use of \"teamwork\"(what I refer to it as) where you can party with others to get the same drops from hunting or foraging. Not to mention the use of having flow trees that require multiple players to chop in order to obtain it's wood. There is an endless amount of things to do in this game, all at your own pace.

With its amazing variety of things to do and the decidedly less violent take on social gaming it caters to those more inclined to less violence and/or women like me that couldn't care less about all the rampant PvP out there in gaming today. The interesting premise and the fascinating archaeological themes just attract the nerdy chick in me and I keep coming back for more and more!

Reading Discord and other Forums, it seems they are slow to add any real expansion and have only added visual content since the Beta Release. The Update today even speaks of \"bringing back\", instead of \"look at all the new content\".\r\n\r\nThere are things you will wish you knew before you spend any Real World Cash, like buying the Plot Backgrounds, because you only get 2 free Plots, and it is the most expensive thing in game to have to purchase. I spent $80 in RWC, to find out that I still will have to work, virtually forever, to get the in-game Coin to purchase the additional Plots to show off my $80 investment in the game.\r\n\r\nI do not like that it is similar to a Browser Game, in that every time you purchase a Plot Item, the price goes up, SIGNIFICANTLY. You get NOTHING better, bigger or new, in fact, you only have 2 Main House Options even available, right now. Browser Games sell In-Game Coin for Real World Cash, but you cannot purchase Coin in this game.\r\n\r\nI am holding out hope that it grows and expands in the very near future, but I am still having fun, and there are some neat ways to decorate that are keeping me busy, for now.",

Players call out and mark rare spawns of ore, trees, plants and critters and wait for others to arrive. There's a gifting system where players help each other out with items they have had in the past but need now.  You can decorate your home plot with thousands of items from drops to different buildings and recently added building blocks. I've seen fortresses, castles and custom homes. There are bugs like any other EA game. The cash shop is a bit overpriced IMO, but only contains companion pets, cosmetics and skins so nothing in the shop is mandatory to buy to enjoy the game.",

It's so good and I'm happy to buy the cosmetics just to support the devs! Hours and hours of fun and wonderful people to play with, it's perfect. \n\nMy biggest complaint is the storage space. 8 chests, even upgraded, is nowhere near enough when you get to late game. I greatly appreciate stuff like furniture not taking up space, but that is kind of expected since you can't sell it, which also sucks.\n\nAnd the other main complaint is that the controller support, while functioning and decent, it's still not great yet. Many features still require you to use your keyboard and sometimes the controller functions stop working for 1 button, like jumping or sprinting which can be frustrating if you are trying to do a jumping puzzle. \n\nAlso the last tiny complaint is that trying to set up the kitchen stuff is a nightmare. It will tell you that you don't have a stove when you have 2. What it means is you don't have a stove that you havn't unlocked yet. It took me so long to figure this out for petit fives that it means the NEXT step up from a stove that you initially start with. It was hours of headache and just sucked.\n\nOtherwise I really do enjoy playing Palia, I just hope with further work and additions that the storage, kitchen and controller's features will improve.",

It’d also be nice if villagers could live with you if you are in a relationship with them, like in Stardew Valley.\n\nThe biggest downside is the lack of clothing crafting.

      "https://steam/76561198118238232": "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-19)](https://steam/76561198118238232)\nI've been playing Palia for a few months now, and I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical at first, being an MMO, which I had deliberately stayed away from for years. However, this is unlike any MMO I've ever played before. There is no combat, no enemies, and group play is highly encouraged. There is also no player economy, only that between you and the NPCs. \n\nMain Goals: Building your dream home in your own housing plot is the ultimate goal. And this is actually where the game starts you off. The quests are definitely worth doing for both the story line and the rewards. They opens up parts of the game you wouldn't be able to access otherwise, and many of the rewards include decor items absolutely worth having. Building friendships with the NPCs is equally important, and very similar to Stardew Valley, Garden  Paws, and the My Time at Portia game series, among others, I'm sure. The rewards for these in Palia, though, feel much more rewarding. \n\nGroup play: playing in parties has its perks; everyone gets the same loot as long as you're within a certain range of one another. However, it's not completely necessary. If you and another player hit the same rock, node, tree, game animal, etc., at the same time, you both contribute to \"tagging\" it, and you both get loot. Fishing has a bonus, too, when fishing near other players.\n\nGifting: Another aspect of group play, in regards to player economy is the gifting system. There's no trading, such as between players directly or in a party, (though this has been heavily requested), but you can request items through the social tab and another player can gift it to you that way. And to help mitigate abuse of this system, there is a daily cap on how many times you can request items.\n\nThe Material Grind: This is similar to other games in that you still have to do it almost constantly, and the rarer materials, such as Palium ore, and other foraging items, make it that much more of a grind. However, group play, in parties, or just running round with other players, and call-outs to these rare locations in chat help to make this easier. There are only two main map areas at this time, as well, and certain materials are restricted to each location respectively. There is also fishing and bug catching, and both have nice perks, which I won't spoil here.\n\nFood and Crops: You have your crops you grow in your housing plot, both for selling and for making food. The food provides what the game calls \"focus\" which gives you a boost to XP while in the world farming materials and while crafting. Food and focus are both important. \n\nMaking Money: Fish, bugs, and extra crops will be your primary money makers in the beginning. Extra crafting materials are also good money makers in later game. Crafted decor items cannot be sold, but they also do not take up inventory space in your chests. \n\nCommunities: This is Palia's equivalent of Guilds. However, it's still a work in progress. There's not much to do in Communities yet, but I hear that it's getting a face-lift, so I'm excited to see what's coming for communities. Hopefully this also includes a Community Plot and daily goals. \n\nOverall I absolutely recommend this game, whether you're a seasoned MMO player, or new to MMOs, or just looking for casual group or individual play. Since there's no combat system and everyone shares materials in the world, this eliminates most of the game stress you get from more competitive MMOs. And if you do feel stressed, or need time alone, you can simply spend hours in your housing plot building your very own palace!",

      "https://steam/76561198121485117": "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-16)](https://steam/76561198121485117)\nI WANT to recommend this game. However, doing so would be setting others up for disappointment.\n\nThis game has the potential to be one of the most comfortable and relaxing MMOs to have ever been made. I truly mean that. But in order to do that it would need to be developed by an entirely new team/company, probably. \n\nThe issues:\n1. The game is so filled to the brim with glitches and game-breaking bugs that they NEVER should have even considered it past alpha. The ground will vanish. The menus will bug out. The NPCs are almost nonfunctional. The quests will bug out. The list is actually so long I won't bother. Just know that the game BARELY functions. \n\n2. The optimization of the game is ATROCIOUS. You can run all the way to the center of the (only) town in the game and the buildings will STILL be popping into existence one wall at a time with 20 second intervals between them. The town is TINY! How?! It's truly horrid.\n\n3. This is the one that pisses me off. The thing that makes me unwilling to be patient with this anymore is that they continue to push out CONSTANT updates. \"For what?\" you may ask. \n\n[h1] IN-GAME PURCHASES and MICROTRANSACTIONS BAAAABBYYYYY [/h1] \n\nIt's the ONLY THING they care AT ALL about. They make it more and more clear as they keep releasing more real-money skins into the game. (Funny too because even these are bugged as hell. They glitch into themselves and look just truly terrible.)\n\nMy wife and I have played a lot of this game. (Mostly on Switch...which...lol don't bother...) We really were loving the comfortable relax vibes as we tried to wind down at the end of the evening. But the game has become steadily more unplayable and just filled to the brim with microtransactions. \n\nWant this game to succeed? Fire the team making these decisions and get better programmers. Until then this looks like a cash grab of the laziest nature. \n\nEdit just to add: If you try to bring up any of your concerns with this game to it's community you will be shouted down and removed from any of their communities you bring it up in. It doesn't matter how civil you try to be about it when expressing genuine concerns. For such a cozy game and a (normally) super positive community they DO NOT like when you ask questions like 'Why are the buildings not loading in anymore?\" I don't understand the zealous nature of the defense of this particular game by its players but it's kind of weird.\n\nEdit 2: Right after posting this review they released more patches. Not only did they not fix any of their old bugs in these AND add more bugs, but they also made sure to let everyone know they have more cosmetics to buy! \n\nI am so disappointed. This isn't a game. It is a cosmetics shop hunting for whales with a \"game\" around it as an afterthought. I really wish this game was developed by someone with integrity and standards because it could be so good.",

      "https://steam/76561198040751181": "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-16)](https://steam/76561198040751181)\nDo you like Breath of the Wild and wish it were multiplayer and more laid back? Do you like Animal Crossing and wish to have more freedom with how you place your decor? Do you enjoy farm sim games like Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley, or Fields of Mistria and wish it were a 3D title instead?\r\n\r\nThen allow me to introduce you to Palia!\r\n\r\nCurrently in Beta and free to play with cosmetic options for those who like some icing on the cake, Palia is perfect for anyone who wants a casual farm sim/adventuring MMO with low stakes and a lot of heart. It's very forgiving in terms of game play, where even in situations where you can die, death is not a huge setback. This is a boon to those who aren't talented in platforming, which is an aspect of the game critical to advancing the main story quest line.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of this game I specifically enjoy are the characters. They're beautifully rendered, and every single npc has something going on. From the hard-on-their-luck farming family, to the mayor's dysfunctional home, the variety and intricacies of the social circles in Palia fascinate me. As someone who yearns for variety in character design, this game is a breath of fresh air. I only wish the dating pool in Palia were a bit broader!\r\n\r\nAs this game is still in beta, there are some areas of the game that could use improvement. As previously mentioned, I would enjoy seeing more bachelors and bachelorettes added to the roster. Sifuu, Ashura, and Zeki come to mind. Yes, even though some people might find them abrasive. Okay, this includes Eloise and Caleri too. Could be fun romance paths, after all.\r\nAnother aspect I have found a little frustrating is that sometimes, quests aren't clear about the next step to take. I understand this can be used to encourage exploring. When it works, quests feel like they have a snowballing effect that's naturally rewarding. Being stymied because an objective was just a little too obtuse (and don't get me wrong, I'm a veteran of point and click adventure games so obtuse solutions aren't a deal breaker for me) can be a turn off. Hopefully the devs smooth this part out a bit. I can see it negatively impacting gameplay for some folks.\r\n\r\nLet's wrap this up with talking about the building aspect. Progression through crafting trees are fairly straightforward: gather materials, craft, invent (or buy) new recipes, and repeat. Progress rarely feels like a grind. Although there are some aspects that make a player slow down, such as when items are in a smelter or other materials processing, I find it balances out so you're freed up to go out into the world again.\r\n\r\nTL:DR; Great casual social game for folks who like farm sims with a little bit of intrigue. I think I'll be playing this one for hundreds of hours into the future.",
      "https://steam/76561198797595311": "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-16)](https://steam/76561198797595311)\nFun and exciting game play and story line. Some glitches but that's to be expected with beta testing. Some things that I wish could be added were 1. more facial feature characterization options. Right now the facial features are limited into the selection of head shape (choosing a head shape comes with eyes, nose and lips already pre-selected with that particular head shape). It would be nice to be able to choose your own eyebrow shape, eye shape, lip shape, etc. 2. Another thing that was hard for me to adjust to was trying to find people for quests. It might be nice to add a hint of when said person would out in the time of day or where to look for them. Granted most people you talk to who send you to go look for someone will tell you, but I can't tell you how many times I went looking for Hodori not being able to find him on the map. Which leads me to my next suggestion. 3. It would be nice to have a visual in-game other than the compass above the screen. Like a trail of mystical glitter to follow when you set a way-point. These are honestly my only pet peeves and they are small but the way-point one was very frustrating for me. I have ADHD and Autism so my brain gets easily distracted but wants to find the fastest route which sometimes makes it take longer to find someone--and the more I mess up the more overstimulated I become because I can't find what I'm looking for. It just makes for a not fun internal situation I have to handle over something someone who doesn't struggle with what I do might not. Definitely a fun game that I look forward to seeing the further development of and see how things unfold.",

I like to think of it as a cross between games like Harvest Moon, Story of Seasons, Stardew Valley, and Animal Crossing. There's plenty of skills to learn and master, tools to upgrade, and achievements to be had. Partying up is the best way to play this game not only because it's fun, but with more people, you reap more rewards. It's free to play too with the optional cosmetic purchases for your character and your plot, so if you're interested, definitely give it a whirl. You might find that you very much enjoy it.",

My first ever, 'cozy', type of game, so mostly just building up life skills and running quests. \n\nLeveling up your skills of course gets tougher the more you level up, so there is quite a bit of grind, especially if you add in grinding for money. \n\nThe climbing system can be a bit glitchy and can be frustrating when trying to climb something but your character pulls out their glider instead. \n\nCommunity seems friendly and I appreciate the etiquette when it comes to chopping down flow trees and/or palium. The server always seems to be active, so you never really feel like you're playing alone (which is something I liked about Once Human, but that game appears to have died).\n\nNot bad for a free game. Apparently the last big update had more to do with adding more cash shop items than it did actually fixing bugs and improving QOL issues, so take it for what its worth. At the end of the day, the only color that makes the world spin is green!",

The game gives me Animal Crossing NH vibes in the similar ways that I catch bugs, fish, garden, gather rss, decorate and even build relationships with the npcs. I have completed the story up to where it currently is and though I know a lot of people want more, as do I, I understand the game is still very early on in its development with a fairly small team. The devs are pretty transparent with what's going on at any given time (they are pretty active on their discord). Between twitch drops and event gifts from the studio there has been a fair amount of additional items given to players that I think are a nice touch. Though there are glitches and bugs that happen with every patch, updates are fairly regular imo with one pretty much monthly that adds a decent amount of features plus fixes to the game. Considering it's a free game it is hard to argue that it's not worth it, even if you only play until the current content runs out, I think the overall design of the game and gameplay will draw back existing players as the game expands (elderwoods etc). It has been fun to meet some cool people through the game too since it is so socially driven. I also enjoy streaming it and watching other streamers play it, I think there is a lot of potential for big group events within communities who play together (though party limit is currently 4).",

It's a super cozy game where your character fosters relationships with the villagers and develops skills to build up a personal housing plot. There is a main story quest, and the NPCs have their own quest story lines to follow. The writing is very cute, and pretty much everything in the game just screams positive vibes.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of bugs in the game, but the developers stay transparent about things they're working on. For a free game, I don't feel like I can complain too much! The main bugs I've personally run into are clipping through the environment at times.

I play this game quite often when I'm bored and I've managed to put in over 200 hours while exploring, hunting, fishing, and building my house and farm. The game has surprisingly a lot to do considering its a free game with the only in-game purchases being cosmetic. I have to say, in the MMO aspect of the game, you might not find yourself interacting much with other people, but when you do the community is nice and will help you out if you need guidance.

Its a great idea and i can see it being fun for majority of people (personally not my type of game, pretty much for little kids and should have stayed on switch). However, here's my problems with it:\n\n- To actually login to make a Palia account (if u decide to), you need to change a few keys. Even when using a PC layout it didn't recognise the mouse or keyboard. If you're on steam deck, it is playable but the controls are weird af.\n\n- Character customisation is buggy, constantly changing for example a characters shirt even though u didn't click anything. This made the process longer.\n\n- Game play at first was attractive, but past that first stage, its rather boring. There's nothing attractive other than it being apparently a cozy game. I want missions and the ability to do whatever but the tutorial is long af, unoriginal characters, long and generic conversations, and...no..its boring.",

You can talk to villagers, fulfill quests and become friends. There is a main story, but there is no urgency to it. Basically, you can just collect resources and build a nice little home. The map is big enough to allow some exploring, yet small enough to constantly see other players. I think that the co-op aspect could still be fleshed out a little. Other than playing some mini-games or gathering resources even quicker, there does not seem to be much benefit to working together right now.",

The unstuck function did nothing, neither did restarting the game. Luckily, the map has a teleporting function that I could use to return home and, next time I wandered into town, everything had loaded correctly and no issues happened. I continued to play around and have fun until about  a couple hours later, when it happened again. This time, my teleport button was on cooldown (what the heck!?) and I had to stop playing because I couldn't get out from under the house.\r\n\r\nI was incredibly pissed and considering stopping for good, but this was proof that the game already had its claws on me. I was enjoying interacting with the towns-folk, all pretty stereotypical on the surface but with hidden depths which are revealed organically through talking to them and finishing missions. The many systems of the game are engrossing and interesting: fishing is not limited to pushing a button when the fish bites, cooking is not limited to adding the correct ingredients. The sense of progression feels very real, both by missions slowly unlocking one another and new systems and gadgets becoming available, and made me want to keep playing to see what unlocks next. I have a couple of minor gripes, but they're far, far outweighed by the amount of Good Brain Juice™ I get from playing.\r\n\r\nThe MMO aspect feels a bit undercooked, but it definitely fosters a friendly environment for interactions, and I think that's the most important part of it. \r\n\r\nOverall, I'll keep playing Palia as much as I can, until I inevitably fall through the ground into a limbo from which there's no escape.",

Pretty sure its a \"Free\" knockoff from that other game.\nI'm never playing this or supporting the devs again because of how much BullS*** this game is.\n\nFull of bugs, terrible netcode, over a hundred hours wasted on just trying to play the game normally via the Story (that I cant finish CAUSE of bugs.) that should have been fixed MONTHS AGO but still has a FEW fun elements.\nNot only do they just release $50 skins and one (MAYBE two) bug fixes every few months, they rebranded their ENTIRE company to hide the past failure games they've made. MOBILE GAMES.\n\nI personally Invested over $100 into this games cosmetics, and theres been no actual fixes to the game/netcode that actually matter. (THIS GAME IS VERY EASY TO EXPLOIT)\n\nTheir Social tab is a joke, it never saves parties (friend requests are always broken), chat is always down etc.\nTheir company seems to only put effort into their Assets, and NOT into the actual game servers. (which, has NO CLOUDFLARE protection btw, so their servers could be DDosed VERY easily.\n\nI love the feel of the game regardless of the bugs, but since I learned about \"Disney Dreamlight Valley\" being released first, I wont be playing this anymore or supporting the devs.\nThey keep teasing a new area, but theres no leaks, or even teaser images. Once you complete the Story (in about a Week of playing in hours) and get the highest tools, there's NOTHING TO DO.\n\nGive it a try, but good luck running it, it takes a NASA super computer to play it at an OK framerate with the version of Unreal 5 their running at MEDIUM or LOW settings!!!",

So it's more like 40+ hours)\r\n\r\nPalia is a nice, low stress, farm-ing type MMO-esque game. It's pretty alright.\r\nBut honestly, that's about the extent I can talk about this game.\r\nBecause outside of a few small niche things (Bug catching is like throwing Pokeballs) it really doesn't do much that you can't get from other farming village games. If Palia wasn't f2p, I'd probably not recommend it, but as it has no cost of entry, I'll just say: Try it for yourself.\r\n\r\nIf I had to give a reason for why I wouldn't recommend it, well, just that the game feels very shallow, and you're brick walled by so many timers, meaning you've basically got to wait a while before making very minor progressions. Means that your progression is stretched out over very little content, and when you try to engage with the content, you find out pretty quickly there's little to none of it.\r\n\r\nI stopped playing for something like a year a while back, and came back recently to see what was new, and honestly? Almost nothing substantial, but the number of items in the store has increased by like 400%. \r\nThe game honestly feels like it's a monetised time sink than a genuine experience, which is rather disappointing.\r\nPlenty of potential, not so much of it realised.\r\n\r\nTry it for yourself, but don't hold your breath.",

Too peaceful. too quiet, too slow. Yet Palia somehow combined everything that I love almost on instinct level from other games and just smashed a \"farm sim\" sticker on it. \r\n- Platforming and adventure-ish gameplay approach like in Zelda? Check. \r\n- Smooth controls, interface and social aspect remotely reminding my beloved World of Warcraft? Check.\r\n- Building system so perfect, that it looks like if Todd would give the dev team of Fallout 4 more than half-a-day to develop it? Check.\r\n- Basically, everything you need from a canonical farming/life simulator aka Stardew Valley? CHECK.\r\n\r\nThis game certainly has some grinding implemented in it, yet considering how well the world, sound and the whole vibe of this game are designed, it doesn't matter at all. You can just go with the flow, carelessly run around and do random stuff while enjoying the calming music and peaceful views and in no time you, apparently, have collected half the stuff you needed for another bundle. \r\n\r\nSurely, a decent amount of work is seen in how light and welcoming the in-game world feels. The main storyline is finely implemented in this world, it develops in front of the player with good pace and it has some sort of a mystery in it, that makes me want to find out more. But the characters are not that interesting (except for a mere couple) and they seem more generic, than writers probably wanted them to be. \r\n\r\nOverall, I am very glad that I have stumbled upon this game so randomly, and it brings me nothing but relaxation and joy so far.

It's an MMORPG with a cozy atmosphere to it. Emphasis on cozy.\r\n\r\nPROS:\r\n\r\n1) The art style is pretty. I see elements of Genshin Impact and Breath of the Wild here, but Singularity 6 makes their own artistic mark, too. It's really quite attractive. I like the little details, like that you can see the breeze blowing.\r\n2) The characters are memorable individuals with their own personalities and stories. You can even romance some of them, like Tish, the carpenter cutie.\r\n3) You can build your own homestead/dream house, and deck it out in decorations of all kinds. Want a farmhouse? A cottagecore cottage? A witchy abode? Something with fashionable chic? You can probably build it.\r\n4) There's 8 different professions you learn along the way. While some may be familiar, such as mining, some also seem unique to this game (or at least unique to a small handful of games), such as bug catching and furniture making.\r\n5) The world is interesting and beautiful. It's small, because they just released it into beta like a year ago, but it already has a thriving community. There's a bunch of how-tos on YouTube, 3 or 4 wikis, and some interactive maps online. There's currently only two adventuring zones, Kilima Valley and Bahari Bay, but Singularity 6 is working on their third: The Elderwood. Despite its small size, there's plenty to do. Decorating your homestead will keep you busy for a while just by itself.\r\n6) At least for right now, while it's in beta, Palia is free to play. No subscriptions, no season or battle passes, none of that nonsense. Just download, make a character, and get lost in this world.\r\n7) It's RELAXING. You can't die. There is no fall damage. You don't pass out like in Stardew. In fact, the late hours give you access to special materials, like magical flow wood. It's not violent, either. The hunting, for example, drops a loot bag. No skinning, or bones, or anything gross. I'm not sure if Sing-6 is going to change it (I hope not), but you can go anywhere without fear of aggroing a monster that lays you flat. It's truly relaxing.\r\n\r\nCONS:\r\n\r\n1) I'm having an issue with storage. You can get up to 5 bars in your backpack, but you run out of space quick. You start with 3, I believe, the 4th one is 5K gold, and the 5th is a whopping 25K gold (I'm having some trouble building up that amount. You know how you can make and utilize as many storage chests as you want in Minecraft? Not in Palia. You can only set down eight, and they fill up rapidly. Hoarding stuff for cooking or furniture making is difficult, because it all takes up precious space. I'm hoping they fix this soon. I'd like to build a storage warehouse on my land.\r\n2) There's some place you can get stuck, which has happened to me a few times. They have a button on the main menu for a stuck character, so that's good. But, it's still annoying. I've also seen other players sink into the ground a little. Occasionally, an NPC appears to have a pathing problem, where their walking becomes stuttered or they scooch along the ground without moving. Again, beta.\r\n3) They have a lot of interesting outfits and stuff in the game store. As far as I can tell, none of it is game-changing, so no pay-to-win. It's all just cosmetic. However, more than a few people have mentioned it being a little spendy, so you have to decide whether it's worth it if you're thinking of buying something. I think it's how they make their revenue, because the game is free to play right now. I'm not sure how else they make money.\r\n4) The progression feels a little slow, but since the world is still small, the rate of progression might be a good thing right now. After profession level 5, hunting, fishing, foraging, mining, and bug-catching seem to slow down a lot. A little patience is necessary, but the pace isn't insurmountable. They may tweek it a bit when the world gets bigger, and they finish with beta testing.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I love this game. I've only been playing for maybe 3 weeks, and I immediately fell in love with it. It's cozy enough to be called a cozy game, but there are some challenging aspects to it. I look forward to what Sing-6 comes up with. They seem to care about their work and the players.

Even then, there's still plenty to do. The only thing you need to pay for is cosmetic items, which honestly is understandable since the game is free.

Word of warning, if you like fast paced combat, non-stop action, and strategy this is not the game for you. If you however like peaceful venues, meditative music, great roleplay, and having fun with your friends this game has it all. You can build your own houses, you can have a bit of romance if you want, you can explore the entire map freely, and build all the furniture there is in the game and decorations. There are rewards for completing tasks and leveling sills, and trophies for hitting milestones. This is a lot of content considering that this game is still in beta. This game developer is clearly in it for the right reason, they clearly know what their audience wants, and they are promising more content to come... in fact their most recent patch added MORE furniture you can craft and collect. Despite not having any fast paced action I have already spent 172 hours in this game at the time of writing this review. This game makes it clear that you don't need fast paced action or strategy to enjoy a game, this is by now means a game like SWTOR, Skyrim, ESO, and The Fallout Series, and I am quite fine with that. Palia is not for fans of those franchises, and to be fair I have encountered very few bugs when compared to those games. The developers don't force you to spend money on unnecessary things to enjoy the great majority of the game, but they have this option. Most if not all of the things in this game can be crafted or bought with in game currency that you gain through in game means. WIll they at one point charge for this game? maybe but that day has not come. My belief is that they are doing fine at the moment with the players they have and with selling in game items and have no need for it at the moment. I do not foresee that this will change anytime soon but i would not mind it if it did change, because this game in every sense of the word is a paradise. It is calming and exciting, and makes me content. It is a game that is easy to play and because of it's nature there is no possibility of griefing like other games; this fosters a helpful and kind community. In conclusion is implore you, give this game a chance. You will not be sorry.",

The downside for me is that it is a little bit glitchy at times, the party system only works half of the time, and i ruined a star quality dish because it froze the cooking animation ;-; (its hidden in my house now ^^)\r\n\r\nOverall, solid 10/10 for me.

For instance, climbing isn't perfect. Sometimes when you glide to a wall you grip it and then fall down it a little before you start climbing. I'm not hugely fond of the trade system in the game. I understand the reason they had it set up the way they do. They are trying to prevent people from getting things they haven't gotten themselves from other players. It just makes it a little frustrating when you spend a few hours trying to catch a fish and never see it, but your friend has one they don't need. \r\n\r\nThat being said, this game has given me hours of fun fishing, mining, foraging, cooking, gardening, decorating, befriending the villagers, etc. There is so much to do, a bunch of little puzzles in the world, and over all the game play is fun. As a free to play game, I was willing to spend some money on cosmetics because I got enough enjoyment out of the game to spend it.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot to love here in a cozy game. The cooking is a lot of fun. You can cook with your friends, and each person who helped gets a stack for themselves. The fishing is relaxing, the mining/logging/foraging is straight forward and satisfying, the bug catching is fun and a nice edition to the game, and by far the best part of it all is meeting all of the villagers and building your relationship with the town. Finding out their likes and dislikes, and seeing their reaction when you gift them what they want for the week. \r\n\r\nI would say despite some of the little bugs here and there, the game itself is well worth playing.",

I only have one true issue with this game and its that fact that there just is not enough storage space, like why cap us at 8 chests?

The housing customization has a good amount of freedom to it and the professions are both intertwined and can give you something to place in your house/s (for the most part, not sure if you can craft food that can be placed). The community also seems to be nice. I saw people calling for other players in chat when they see a rare resource so that others can go there and take it as well, which left an impression on me. And there\\s a gifting system where you can request for an item and others can give it to you which also encourages cooperation.\r\nGranted there are some mobile game-esque mechanics like waiting more than 10 minutes for a resource to be prepared, but you can't rush it with premium currency so I feel it's there mostly to put an emphasis on slow play, which is a good mentality to have with such games.\r\nThe game is free to play with the option to buy cosmetics so there's little reason to not try it out if one's interested.",

The NPCs are charming (many of them quite cheesy, in the absolute best way) and the design of both the village and the landscapes are as well, and the critters are varied enough to stay interesting as you explore. The quests are sometimes tricky to figure out what or where you're supposed to do and go, but the puzzles themselves are tricky enough to be pleasant without being frustrating in their difficulty or complexity. Everything seems well-paced, quests and skill-progression and character relationships. \r\n\r\nAll in all it's a wonderful experience, and the fact that the predominant attitude of the other folks playing online seem so far to be amiable has been a refreshing relief, as is the fact that the world rarely seems so crowded with other players as to overwhelm any given area.

I've been going through a rough time and my brother recommended this game as a casual and laid back experience. There's no combat, rather there are 8 skills that you can level up by using those skills. There is an adventure aspect to it, even a few \"dungeons\" which are puzzle-based, like a lighter version of a Legend of Zelda puzzle. The game does get grindy, where you need to keep fishing or catching bugs over and over, and there are a few improvements that could be made, I.E. giving residents gifts from your storage would be nice, instead of having to run back to my home, check who wants what, and pull it all out of the chests. There is a crafting aspect to the game for tool upgrades, smelting and building a home, but even that gets difficult to keep up with as things become pretty expensive pretty quickly.

The developers of this game should be embarrassed at the lack of professionalism within it. The real money store is a predatory ploy for young players. The waiting periods for crafting are absurdly long and make the game feel like a mobile game. The additions to this game are extremely slow to arrive and often do not arrive on the expected date. There are frequent keybinding and clicking bugs that must be solved by players. The list goes on. I keep coming back to this game waiting for it to be something that it isn't; good.

I am writing this review with only about 4-5 days of me playing this game. You be the judge if I like this game or not.\n\nFor being a Beta game it surely has a lot and is fun. Already got me spending money to buy some clothes. But overall this game is very fun. Similar to Stardew Valley but it's coop and has of course it's own features to it. There's a learning curve to this game and it gives you a vague description or tutorial on how to do things, so I get why it's overwhelming to many. Google will be your best friend with this game. The community is VERY FRIENDLY. Everyone is so nice. There's some unspoken Palia Ethics already which I love. \n\nOverall, just needs some more tutorials for beginners and some items. I do hope they publish a \"Trade with Other Player\" feature and some Farm Animals and possibly a Mount you can ride, since it's a bit difficulty to get to one place to another.",
      "https://steam/76561198124741888": "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-28)](https://steam/76561198124741888)\nFor a free game that's in beta still, you can see by the play hours of the positive reviews this game already offers a lot, and I had a really good time with it!\n\nHere I'll go through what I was looking for before playing, the pros and cons and then offer some tips at the bottom. \n\nBasically:\n+ lovely peaceful game\n+ lots to do\n+ not greedy devs, cosmetics only\n- very buggy\n- story and design still in beta\n\nHow free is it? \nIt's just cosmetics; there's no way to pay to be better or faster. When you log in the first time, there's a message from Singularity 6 which basically says \"if you like our game please tell people about it\" which I thought was really nice, I never felt pressured to spend, I bought a couple of cosmetics to support them for giving me 100 hours of enjoyment.\n\nWhat is the gameplay?\n\nVery casual and easy-going, it's based around building your home and the core skills which you level up; bug catching, cooking, fishing, foraging, furniture crafting, gardening, hunting and mining. As you level up you unlock more things you can craft for each skill and these skills are how you interact with the story, complete objectives and challenges.\n\nThe villagers work the same way; you level up your relationship with them to unlock cool things and more quests, they also provide the structure; context to the quests and objectives you'll be completing. A small part of this is the main story line, which is pretty interesting so far, but I'd say like 10% complete at the moment. There are other stories of different villagers which are complete to varying degrees, since the game is in beta. I'll say the few cutscenes that are finished are really nice.\n\nThis happens across two maps Kilima (medium sized) and Bahari (large sized), and there's a lot of running around, but there's no fall damage and nothing can hurt you. There is fast travel, but the game does not point it out (I'll get to that). \n\nEverything important to the game tends to work well and is fun! It didn't lag at all or crash hardly at all. I was able to do most of everything required in the game without big issues.\n\nNow, there are some negatives to consider; being a beta this game has many, many smaller bugs!\n\nIn my time almost everything you can think of had some sort of glitch (maps, menus, chat, gameplay, etc); there's a lot so here are some examples of the prominent common issues I had, as experienced played with a controller:\n\n1. Menus can be jank, it gets stuck and you have to switch to the next tab and then back to fix it. Sometimes also you press a button to do one thing and it does something else which uses the same button. \n\n2. The map can be jank, you select one villager to track and it keeps selecting somebody else far away.\n\n3. Also, from the map you can press a button to teleport home; this button is the same as the run button, but sometimes after closing the map menu, the game thinks it's open when it's not, so when you return to game and go to run you teleport home when you don't want to; since the areas are large and you have to wait before you can use the home teleport again, this bug was by far the most annoying!\n\n4. You have a wheel to select the tool you want, sometimes it selects the same tool over and over again and you miss out on a rare insect or hunting opportunity because you can't put your fishing rod away in time.\n\n5. Visually, EVERYBODY, every NPC and player, bug out; they're gliding across the floor, standing in the ground, floating above the ground, walking in place, walking through walls, appearing to fall, some players even get stuck under the inn. You can buy a cosmetic pet that runs around with you, but I couldn't use it because it was constantly bugging out and distracting me; dropping from the sky in front of me or flipping out, and other player's physics items are always stretching and glitching out. Mostly this happens when you first get there and from a distance, but not always. It did not affect the gameplay but it's absolutely something you'll notice, even if you do get used to it quickly.\n\n6. A few NPC positions can make it hard to interact with them or around them, like Hassian stands on the same exact spot as his dog Tau, and Shiffa blocks access to her own anvil, so you have to jump around to find the specific spot needed.\n\n7. I had a constant bug where my character would keep turning 180 degrees when still to face the camera; I HATE this bug, especially when you're around other players, lol.\n\nThere are design issues too: \n\n1. Lack of tutorials for important or basic things, or tutorials appearing far after you need them when you're first starting. I had to look up basic things on my phone because simple, obvious things like dragging and dropping would not work.\n\n2. You can't sell furniture you make, even for the price of the materials or for 1 gold just to get rid of them; you have to store or destroy furniture.\n\n3. NPCs sometimes ask for outrageously rare items for little to no reason.\n\n4. If you don't enjoy one of the skills it can take a long time to reach the level up needed (like I don't enjoy cooking). A few quests require items only obtainable by progressing far in one of these skills, but there should always be another way to get these items, even if it's tricky, otherwise you're forcing players to grind something they don't enjoy. This was rare but still an issue.\n\n5. Lastly, I'd say some of the quests require a lot of work and have a little or no pay off (Jina's picnic, Tish's dance) I again assume due to being beta. Some quests are very anticlimactic and end with no real consequence.\n\nOverall:\n\nEven despite all of that jank I had a great time with this game. This main gameplay of using your skills to help NPCs and unlock things as you play was peaceful and mostly fun and rewarding, you can decorate your property quite impressively, and throughout the game it's fun discovering what you can unlock you had no idea about. \n\nThere's a review saying this game is not for introverts but I really have to disagree, I think there's one quest that might need interaction (fulfil a player request). If you do want to talk the game is basically full of people who just want to chill and build a cool little house, so I found people really chill and helpful anyway. Totally recommend!\n\nTips!\n\n1. Know what you have! \n\nThere's a lot of rare and epic items in the game, some which can take days to find if you're looking for them, which you might find by chance, so if you're just starting and you get an epic bug or fish that you don't know what to do with, keep it! (as you might want it later for something to do with a door and night sky temple) and if you see a weird bug try and get it!\n\n2. I would NOT gift any NPC a rare or epic item unless it's for a quest objective, it's not worth it! Also one specific bug, Duskwing Butterflies, are listed as \"uncommon\" but they're technically like epics in rarity.\n\n3. Cooking uses items from your inventory first, then from your storage, so make sure you have enough stuff to protect the things you want to keep! You can buy a locked chest from Tish's shop to keep things safe.\n\n4. For fishing, if you're trying to catch a certain fish (especially rare or epic fish), it will show you the fish before you reel it in to see if you need it or not so if you don't want it, don't reel it in! \nOnce the fish has gone back down, then reel in, as this will reset the fish and you'll keep the bait; really important for glow worms which are hard to get, but keep an eye on the condition of the rod!\n\n5. The Palia wiki is really useful for finding things.\n\n6. You'll eventually get to glowy (flow) trees, people meet up to chop these at the same time. If you hit each glowing tree once with your axe you get the same loot as everyone else who hits it, even if you don't chop it down! It's kind to let people know the location (you'll see this in chat a lot).\n\n7. You can date all the villagers with no consequence, they don't care, lol.\n\nHave fun!",

It instantly sucked me in. It's like if an MMO didn't infuriate you and it was just the good stuff. There's no combat so no worrying about dying to something that will just tick you off. I'll go into more specifics below.\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS/NPCs:\r\nThe characters in the village all have their own unique personalities that are easy to remember and you'll definitely come to have your own favorites and...less favorites. You can also initiate a romance with certain characters, something that's really cool and that I wish was incorporated into more games. The dialogue is really well-written and can change based on different factors of your character, something that really adds to the experience. You get different unique quests from the characters when you reach certain friendship goals with them, something that keeps you engaged and constantly keeps you busy with quests.\r\n\r\nQUESTS/RIDDLES:\r\nNormally, riddles infuriate me in games since I am not particularly puzzle inclined. Luckily, most of the riddles in Palia are super easy to solve. I don't have to look things up very often, which is a complaint I have a lot about other games that I've played. There are also a lot of quests which keep you quite busy so that you always have something to do, but not in an overwhelming way.\r\n\r\nSKILLS:\r\nYour character has multiple different skills (Gardening, Farming, Mining, etc.) that you can level up and get a reward when you reach the lv. 10 milestone of a particular skill. It can be a bit of a grind. It's not frustrating, but it can be time-consuming so it just depends on your preference for grinding skills to raise them.\r\n\r\nSHOP/MICROTRANSACTIONS:\r\nSince Palia is free to play, it makes sense to include some content that is paid for with real currency. As of right now, it's only cosmetic aspects (fancy clothes, tool skins, pets, gliders, etc.) that cost money. It doesn't impact that game at all, entirely the player's own preference and even if you don't want to pay for the cooler looking clothes, there are different free options for your character's outfit.",

I was hyped about this game when it first came out, and I may of been expecting a little too much for a game that just had entered closed beta. Then when open beta came, I found myself distracted by a thousand other titles instead.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER. This game has drawn me back to it a few times for my curiosity of it's charm. It has quest lines, crafting of many sorts, farming/grinding material, gold farming, and 8 skills to level; Including cooking, logging, gardening (farming), furniture making (building/decor), mining, bug catching, hunting, and of course everyone's favorite in a game, fishing. Plus, there's building up your own plot with intricate decorating and a lovely building system for it, itches that \"Sims\" game feel. The game also now has a cute minigame called hotpot that everyone wins at technically and can get you prizes, as well as parkour course. My point being, the devs ARE adding things since I first played, and that's what keeps me coming back.\r\n\r\nMy only gripe with the game, and it may be yours too, is that the map is lacking in expansion a bit. If you're someone who loves exploration, you'll enjoy the map for the first 10 hours, but after that, you kinda know where everything is easily enough. I suggest doing the quests to do more exploring and navigational puzzles.\r\n\r\nOverall, a solid 7/10 experience for the average cozy gamer who likes a healthy community and grinding game w/ somewhat MMO experience to it.",

Should be fine solo, but co-op gets ruined by so many related bugs.\n\n- Party members load invisible quite a lot so all you see is a floating name. This lasts until the next loading screen, so you can't see what they do, struggle finding them and can't coordinate properly.\n- Party sometimes breaks in a sense that one person sees the party, but the other doesn't (no party member UI, no compass visibility, friend list says you can invite people that are actually in your party, the button does nothing). This requires a restart.\n- Party member names are sometimes green, sometimes white. Sometimes you see them on the compass, other times you don't.\n- Quests sometimes only show for 1 person on the compass, but if you are next to the NPC, you will see it on top of their head.\n- Quests sometimes only genuinely appear for 1 person in the party, even though you've done everything together from the start. This causes a desync in progression.\n- Party members often show half in the floor (NPCs too), or way underground. I've even seen them run around in the basement of a building when they never even entered it.\n- Fishing rods of other players sometimes appear invisible.\n- Hunting deer is a challenge when the deer spaz and teleport around.\n- Tutorial popups are bugged in an annoying way. I keep seeing the same ones I've seen before reappearing, even had it happen twice 5 seconds apart. There is an option to disable tutorials, but that way you also won't learn anything new you haven't seen before, so it's either getting spammed by useless popups or never learning what you should. Also had a tutorial overal a developer note, which froze all my controls as I couldn't click the button behind the tutorial popup and had to restart.\n\nThese are not hardware/network issues. These are game issues. I am enjoying the gameplay as such, but these issues are frustrating.",

For a free game, you get more than what you pay for. The overall wholesomeness of the game makes it easy to get into. The community is extremely helpful and friends can be made all over. \n\nMuch like the polyamorous relationships with the pretty purple elves; the game actively encourages teamwork and bringing friends along on your errands. There are benefits to working with others and you are able to choose your own pace for the game. \n\nThe game uses real time for progression. Farming and refining materials are done over time. This makes it easy to play casually. Crafting and decorating are straightforward, but cooking has the most interesting mechanics. Preparing meals and putting them together brings an odd sense of satisfaction to my brain.\n\nThere's no combat other than hunting passive creatures, but I suspect something more substantial will be introduced beyond beta.\n\nWhy is it free? Cosmetics. That's all. Supporting the devs is a small price to pay for looking pretty and you're given a large variety of wardrobe items to work with for free anyway and you can change your appearance quite often for no fees. I pray this does not age like milk.\n\nThe greatest feature Palia has to offer is Hotpot. A deceptively addictive card game that's easy to play and easy to love. Even if you don't win a full deck, you still earn rewards. The Tower is also a fun jumping puzzle game if that's up your alley to pass the time.\n\nPalia is a great game to invest in if you're looking for a good time sink.\n\nAlso the Bluebristle Muujin can go to hell.",

Even more fun and addictive with your gf/bf, friends or really, just people around are generally really kind. It's a blast to for example go mining alone, encounter a random player who's hunting and join them on the fly. There's a lot of emphasis on freedom and grouping up with other people, while still being fun playing alone.\r\n\r\nI know it's a free game, but I'd love to see *some* options to get a premium currency slowly. The customization is there, but compared to the rest of the content it's severely lacking unless you pay real life cash.\r\n\r\nIt's everything buy pay to win, though. No P2W, no timewalls, no ads, just a solid game to play for hours on end without any pressure.\r\nIt's great to have a movie/audiobook while having Palia on the side as well",

I won't lie, I'm slightly addicted to it now.\n\nThis game is in beta and already has so much content. The game is jittery, and could do with tweaking a bit in some places, but the developers have done an amazing job already.\nThe game has fishing, farming, foraging, mining, furniture making and cooking. It has friendships and relationships, and numerous quests.\nI personally think more NPCs would be a great addition. Also more farming plots and things to grow. Also more things to hunt. But again this is still a beta game. I have clocked up over 300 hours. They have regular updates, they don't always fix the stuff that needs it, but they always add stuff. Plushies are a major hype in this game. You will find out when you download it.\nIf you're looking for a nice chilled game, then definitely download it, you have nothing to lose while it's free.",

I havent really felt anything is too repetive or anything so far and the public chat / community seems very nice! I think the size of the map is really cool and makes the idea of exploring seem fruitful with the variety of forage types.

I like the music and the atmosphere and the visuals of the game. The decorating aspect of the game is phenomenal, there are so much customization options and super cute pieces to work with. \nSome thing I'm hoping to see in the future would be the ability to have a horse or some kind of means of transport other than running, gliding, or the fast travel option. \nI also wish there was a bit more direction with some of the bigger story-line quests but this isn't a deal breaker issue.",

In general this game is a really fun cozy game and grinding for materials doesn't feel too annoying. I like how it seems to take inspiration from fun activities among a whole bunch of different games in this genre. Only ran into a couple of small bugs that got fixed very quick and never made the game unplayable. I do also like that it's not \"pay to win\" and as far as purchasing things goes it's purely cosmetic things. I thoroughly enjoy the story and game concept and it's very rewarding to play with friends with all the extra perks of teamwork.

You are confined to a fairly small world so you get to know the area quickly. It's kinda got this Disney Dreamlight Valley/Stardew thing going on so you go into town a lot getting to know the same cast of characters developing your relationship tier with them, getting rewards from them etc. \n\nThe home and garden area is a big part of this game as you can visit peoples homes if they are set to public. You expand your land, unlock tons of stuff, craft, decorate. You can even put down the gold tier fish you catch as fish tanks to show off what you've caught. Pretty neat.\n\nLike a lot of survival/gathering you need the nice pick for the big rocks, the nice axe for the big trees etc etc so there is some grind but it's all very casual.\n\nEach in game night starting 6pm until morning, players gather at this casino type area underneath the general goods store and play cards. A foodie go fish style game that rewards you with coins to spin at a wheel of fortune. The tables fill up fast which makes it pretty exciting to get a spot and have fun with the community.\n\nAnother neat community feature is the item request system. You can request a limited number of just about any items. You can help other people get items they need or request something you might need in a pinch.\n\nI had a few bugs mainly dialogue/menu related where I had to restart the game, but the stakes are so low in this game a restart is no biggie and nothing was perma bugged.\n\nOverall hard recommend. For a free game it's worth it.",

I spent about 80 of said hours completing the main story line, but I imagine people who did not venture into the sidequests, relationship and friendship quests could complete the main story line (which finished for me when I completed \"Find your Shepp,\" as it was the last thing I did in the main quest line) in a shorter time period. I am still not finished at 110 hours with friendship quests (have not maxed out any friendships yet) or relationship quests (have only completed 1 at this time). I have only just now reached Level 10 of two of the eight core skills you're expected to develop, and this is considered a Bronze Level while Level 50 of the skill is considered a Gold Level. I have not yet collected all bugs, or fish of Palia. I have not yet built all variations/collections of furniture. I clearly still have many, many hours of game-play left of Palia to complete. You do not need to spend \"real money\" in order to enjoy this game, this game completely functions without the premium cosmetics. But if you're like me, and you have such an enjoyable and incredible experience playing, buying some \"Palia coins\" to spend on cosmetics seems fitting to show your support for the game. My in-game experience with other players has been overall positive. People are helpful, informative, and generally kind. There are one-off experiences where people have strange behavior, but it's the internet. I caught on to in-game lingo quickly, scoured Internet resources and tools to learn a few quirky things about the game; but overall, I have been able to figure out how to play the game on my own or with the in-game guides/tutorials. There's been very little I've had to research on how to do because there wasn't enough instruction, really just driven by my own impatience and desire to complete collections. There's a lot about this game I still don't know about, even 110 hours into it. The seasoned players I read online and especially coming into this game during a new feature called \"Home Tours,\" WOW -- I had no idea how serious some Palia players have been the last 11 months of this game. You will see some people complaining about how there isn't enough to do or how there aren't enough updates or how the developers aren't pushing out enough content; but truthfully, a game that takes 80 hours to complete for a normal person is pretty impressive content. A game that allows you to sink an additional 50+ hours into for just fun and skill building and side-quest completion is even more impressive. People who are criticizing a lack of \"stuff to do\" have just been over-saturating themselves with it and playing too long. Trust me..... there's so much to do..... so many bugs to catch, so many things to build, so many crops to grow, so many jams to make, so many fish to lure... so many, so many, so many things to do.",

You might, I just don't.\n\nI had a lot of trouble getting the game to work. I had to go into my steam audio settings and ensure everything was set specifically to my headphones and mic(which most games just do on their own) or else the game would not load at all... then I had issues where my escape button stopped working and I had to force exit. After that, the game worked, but there's tons of audio stuttering... but, to be fair- my computer is an older one. However, I run Genshin at 60fps most of the time with no audio issues at all.\n\nI find the character designs to be a mixed bag. The player characters are serviceable- I was able to make one of my favorite OCs, but the hairstyle selection was still somewhat limited in terms of longer hair.\n\nThe NPCs are... very jarring? They're very cringe and cutesy, a bit, which... can be fine but they force you through tutorial after tutorial and it gets old really fast... there's lots of tutorial menus appearing on other tutorial menus and it just... does not stop for the first 30 to 40 minutes.\n\nI don't care for the character designs of the NPCs overall. They are just purple people with pointy ears, nothing else to them. That CAN work, but in this case it just feels random and strange... I don't feel immersed at all. There are lots of ways purple or blue elves could work; make their character designs super interesting, but they are all just random human-like people.\n\nThen there's the gameplay. Hunting and fishing are alright. Anything else... zzzzzzzzz. Very boring. The UI feels very unfinished, which for a game that's been out for a year... that's unacceptable.\n\nClimbing is buggy and messy. You'll often clip into things. There's not a lot of people, those that are there don't really talk much. Except the NPCs. They don't shut up :)",

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-17)](https://steam/76561198199326881)\nNot for introverts but extroverts will enjoy. I've played this game almost 100 hours now and while I did enjoy playing it I probably won't play for much longer. Once I got to Exquisite Level Tools it got unplayable for me personally. I am extremely introverted and I like solo playing games. I don't like talking in game chat and will do everything I can to avoid it so once you reach the stage where you need an insane amount of Flow Wood Planks then I can't really enjoy playing anymore. I don't want to have to constantly call out for help to grind flow trees that are uncuttable without a group to make cute furniture. Clothes cost ~$30 or more a set, pets are something like $15 and you can't get them any other way but through the premium shop. Crops take at least 3 hours of real time to grow with watering in between and if they aren't watered their growth pauses so no planting and logging back in later to collect. Takes an hour to process a single crop to increase it's value and you're limited to 9 plots of soil (9 plots w/ 9 spaces so 81 crops total) so you can't really grind crops for money quickly. There is also no way to trade other players or give things away to another person. You can make a request for an item you've already obtained but not one you haven't gotten yourself before and you can't ask a specific person to fill the request. Overall it's cute and a fun game to kill some time but I don't want to be forced to interact with people just to continue playing.",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-08-31)](https://steam/76561198119404184)\nI'm so obsessed with this game! There's so much to do and it's really addicting, the world feels vibrant and beautiful, and I really love the characters as well! Jel has definitely stolen my heart though. ♥ The community is also quite friendly and helpful, which is really nice to see! ♥ I haven't done much socialising though and can comfortably play the game solo or with my partner. Cosmetics like outfits and skins are monetised which kinda sucks but all the rest of the content is free, plus there is more to come as the devs keep working on improving the game. It can be a bit buggy sometimes but it hasn't turned me away from the gameplay at all, in fact, it's hard to stop. I am writing this at 3 am and I really really need to go to sleep but as soon as I wake up I will probably jump right back to it because it's my current hyperfixation. And also I need to talk to Jel. I always need to talk to Jel. Comfort game go brrrr.",

I feel like a game needs more than just gather resources, use resources and do fetch quests for boring NPCs. To me it feels like a mobile game on PC.\r\n\r\nI guess if you like to build a house, this game is OK, but even then there are games that have much better base building AND have a lot more to do otherwise. I would give it a 3/10 - there's nothing that makes you want to continue playing the game. If nothing interesting happens during the first 5 hours of a game, i feel like it's already lacking. There's no incentive to keep playing, it feels like 1/4 of a game.",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-14)](https://steam/76561198073028404)\n[h1] A Splendid and Tranquil Online Game [/h1]\nPalia unfolds in a serene embrace, where melodies drift like whispers on the wind, the world is painted with beauty, its colors soft and inviting, offering endless hours of peaceful pursuits for those who find joy in the gentle rhythm of life’s simpler tasks.\nAnd characters, with their quiet allure, that blossom in your heart over time.\n\nBasically, I like it—quite pleasing!\n\nIt's a life-sim, farm sim that you play at your own pace, with no rush whatsoever. You can play solo or get to know others and do activities together.\n\nIt shines in the art of home design, perfect for those who delight in crafting beautiful spaces.\n\nYou must know, this may be repetitive for some with its grinding mechanics. You will have to decide if it’s your thing or not, but the game is free and there aren’t any imbalances between players. You only buy cosmetics that do not influence game progression.\n\nIt has its own Wiki in case you find it hard to understand what to do, and the community is pretty helpful as well. Just ask your questions in chat, and they'll guide you.\n\n[h3] [u] It's unfinished, so it's not perfect, but it's still pretty good. [/u] [/h3]\n\nOccasionally buggy, loot can sometimes get stuck in the ground, which can be annoying. This happened to me while I was trying to catch a Rainbow-Tipped Butterfly, if I remember correctly. I spent a long time searching for it, only to find it stuck and unavailable for pickup afterward.\n\nI don't find certain puzzles in the story quests engaging; they could use some improvements, but it's not enough to make me stop playing.\n\nYour character moves rather oddly at times, especially when running short distances or climbing. These areas could benefit from some visual and physics enhancements.\n\nAnd a few other quirks scattered about.\n\n[b] I played Palia before it was on Steam, so I have more hours invested than it shows here. I've completed most of the available content. I believe it has great potential. [/b]\n\n7/10 for now.",

Cooking and hunting are our favorite things to do together. But after this last update EVERYTHING IS WRECKED!

      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-20)](https://steam/76561198002973871)\nThis game fails to deliver on it's genre.\nI would have rather paid like 25 bucks for the game instead of it being free if it made all the difference in quality.\n\nThe graphics are less that sub par using the bland washed out cartoon breath of the wild or genshin impact style, except theres no cell shading or graphical effects. The sky doesnt even have any effects for the sun or clouds. The sky is just a blank dome with a 2D image of 4 clouds that rotate on an axis 24 hours a day indefinitely. The skybox is also a low resolution texture of a mountain that you can see the rough pixel edges of without even zooming in. There are no weather effects. You don't get season changes, rain, snow, fog, anything like that.\n\nCrafting is less than rewarding. Your tools have durability and break, upgrading them costs a fortune and hardly make a difference. For example, upgrading a pick axe still requires the same number of hits to destroy rocks because it goes by damage instead of gathering time. Crafting is automated by machines that you are limited by inventory space and time to use.\n\nThe game is also severely lacking in content and full of nearly game breaking bugs, including tools failing to equip, broken animation loops, and quest descriptions that stick and overwrite newer quest descriptions. These are just a tiny few of the bugs.\n\nBug catching is a nightmare. instead of using a net, you have to forage and craft these items that copied pokemon pokeballs, which all have a small chance of successfully capturing the bugs. you can often throw up to 6 or even 8 of these at a single bug and still not catch it. The bugs dont even sell for enough money to pay for the materials used to capture said bugs.\n\nThe NPCs personalities are all very dry and you cannot actually have conversations with them, you are able to interact with them less than you can NPCs in a game like skyrim. They only talk to you when you want to, and its on par with the characters from Animal Crossing.\n\nIn fact everything in this game feels like a cheapened imitation of Animal Crossing, you roam around collecting or trying to grind for things to make pennies on the thousands of dollars it takes to upgrade your house space. Everything is time gated. There is hardly any content in the game at all, there are no big areas to explore, no combat, no dungeons with treasure, and not even any tools to socialize or express yourself with other players.\n\nThat is probably where the game drops the ball the hardest is with player interaction. There are very few clothing options in the game and they all look the same and have some kind of paisley pattern you cannot get rid of. (Paisley is the kind of pattern you find on bandannas irl.) They also want you to spend upwards of 16 to 30 dollars on a single outfit which are mostly comprised of just a shirt and pants. You cannot layer clothing, accessorize, paint or dye your clothing, its either you get it the way it is from the shop and thats it. There are also no players interacting or having conversations in town. They're all just grinding out resources and money. This is probably because theres no chat bubbles, chat console hides itself so you cannot even casually read server chat, and there arent ways to engage or hang out with nearby players. You cannot even sit on furniture in the town, much less go down to the tavern in the game and have a meal with your friends, even though there is a tavern. The character animations are very stiff and robotic, from the idle, running...and thats really the only animations your characters do. They dont really seem alive. They don't stretch, yawn, look around, or transition into other animations well at all. When you go from a hard sprint into standing again, theres about 3 frames inbetween, it looks about at rough as T-posing.\n\nThe housing system. This is the big one, probably the only part of the game where most of the budget went into. You can tell they tried to put some effort into this but its still roughly designed and not executed well. For example, you can build walls for your house so its not just one big room, the walls only go halfway up to the ceiling, you can place a wall near the ceiling instead and leave a gap near the floor big enough for you to walk through, but you cannot stack two walls on top of eachother because the ceiling height is exactly one grid space lower than the height of 2 wall pieces. so you cannot build rooms in your home.If you try to make them overlap instead, there is a massive space between the layers. Containers are cosmetic only and non-functional, you also cannot put furniture wherever you want. Want to put a flower pot on top of your dresser? you can't. Want to put up wallpaper? only for the bottom half of the wall. Want to hang things from the ceiling? you can't. Want to add a window in the corner? you can't. Want to change the walls of your house or the shape of them to not just be a big cube? you can't. Want to have a flower garden? you can't. Fireplace? no. Cupboard with items? no. You cannot do anything detailed with your house leaving it forced to look unlived in, cobbwebbs would look more believable at home in your house than a person living there.\n\nGames that did housing better than Palia and arent even life sim games: Black Desert, Elder scrolls online, Animal Crossing, Minecraft, 7 Days to Die, Raft, Craftopia, Legends of Aria, Phantasy Star Online 2.\n\nIn summary, Nothing this game has as a feature really feels in depth or immersive. You cannot specialize in a field of crafting, theres not even that many things to craft, player interaction just isnt even there (not even for roleplay.)\n\nIf i had to come up with an analogy for this game, its being thirsty and trying to enjoy a glass of water, but the cup is like 90% ice and you're constantly slurping and shaking the glass and waiting for the ice to melt to get a tiny sip and just give up and walk away thirsty when theres a full glass of water for FREE around any other corner.",

I would say this is the easiest way to make money, which you need for EVERYTHING. Want to make your house bigger - money, Want to make your tools better - money. Decorations, plot size, machinery permits, you have to pay money for everything. However the grind doesnt get easier as you progress in the game. You still have only hunting, fishing and mining. Doesnt get much faster, easier or less boring. I find it is normal thing in the begining of game to grind, but there should be oportunity to use machinery to make money later.

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-13)](https://steam/76561198105785179)\n(THis game is still in BETA, and I understand this. This review is personal yet vague enough and sorry I am not going to go into the \"whys\" of some of this review as it's again personal stuff. Just simply, my own review. This most likely will change in the future as the game develops more...\nAnyhow, okay, time for my weird and honest review:\n\n1., I love this game. It is quite addicting. It reminds me of a mixture of games, including a much older game that I grew up with that unfortunately has been shut down long when I was still young. Seeing a game with a similar-ish style and playstyle really allows me to get into this game. To me, I'd say the games are close enough and may even get more similar things added!\n\n2. Relaxing. Very relaxing. I like building games like these where you build your life from the ground up. \n\n3.  I am epileptic along with other things. And can I just say how much I ADORE there for once being a warning something???\nNot just a warning, but a warning that gives you useful ideas and instructions and really just encourages being healthy and safe! Just having a warning there to begin with really puts me at ease and shows that they care. I've talked to devs that have pretty much told epileptics \"oh, sucks to be you. Why should we cater for you?\" and that can make the world honestly feel even more lonely. I mean I get there is a whole debate that could happen right now from what I am about to say, but hey, why not just put a quick warning in your games? Like how hard is that? Or just not be lazy and make decent lighting...\nBut, I am not here to complain. I LIKE THIS GAME BECAUSE THEY TRY TO MAKE IT A GAME EVERYONE CAN ENJOY. And for the photosensitivity stuff, I give this game an A+ from me.\nBy the way,\nI have seen some *weird* stuff flash in and out in the game, but that's really just new game bugs that sometimes just aren't preventable. As for ME, I find the game's lighting and sensitivities and all to be pretty okay. I can't speak for everyone who is photosensitive, but I can say for myself the game is fairly good with that. The character creation screen *may* be sensitive to some, so just make sure to look or keep turned away away at the start of that during the dialogue until it is over.\nSeriously though, thanks for adding this.\n\n4. Einar asked how my day was, I was having a bad day and said so ingame to him, and he gave me a shiny rock to make me feel better. That actually made my day a bit better. Thanks.\n\n5. Unfortunately (due to the next thing), I can't get too much into the lore, but I wish I could. This game is full of diverse characters and quests. I love the worldbuilding and CHARACTER BUILDING especially that the devs put into this game! Very nicely done and not at all unnoticed!\n\n(the next one is a bit personal and super weird and specific and for summary, is just me blabbing about how much I dislike the game shoving humanity down my throat. So if that confuses you, just skip it)\n6., \n[spoiler]Personally I really dislike how much into humanity this game goes. I haven't fully played the quest and keep skipping the dialogue as I am someone who cannot connect to humanity in the slightest. With a game with humanoids and robots, and I am STUCK as a human in a fantasy world, I find it incredibly discouraging. If it has lore like this game, I'd want a game that focuses more on BEING AN INDIVIDUAL and not humanity. Playing as a human is overused and I really can't connect or even care about the plot because it's so centered around humanity and is constantly down your throat about it. Again I understand this is a weird opinion, but I prefer the idea of focusing more on building an individual than clumping them with a species or whatever. Especially in a game that's meant to be an escape from reality. I don't want to be a human in fantasy, why would I want that? I don't want connection to the real world at all when I play games. I like escape. Helps dysphoria a lot and helps with stress---which is WHY I like games like this. Just none that are exactly like this game exist where I can play as a freaking robot or monster or even just a humanoid/inhuman thing (just stating for context, I mean more I'd be down for playing as one of the robots or something like that). I think this game could work on that, but again this is very much a personal addition to my review and simply something I more hope the devs see, probs not but who knows. Just saying, even like just a skin or removing the characters CONSTANTLY shoving humanity down my throat every chance they have would make this game PERFECT for me. Seriously, I can't stand the dialogue because all it does is talk about a topic I am already big no about.[/spoiler] \n\n----\nWhile I understand thew devs have their own visions and for all I know my own visions could be colliding with what this game is all about, I just wanted to state it. Again, maybe any complains from I or anyone will be seen and something will be added to accommodate. I mean heck, if they are by some miracle taking inspiration off of my all-time favourite game, they may add different formes you can become like skins or spells or something for at least the human problem. Again, it's still in beta so it's whatever. I still love the game and want to support it, even if my brain at the moment may not agree with it. (sorry)\n\nAnyhow, devs, keep up the great game",

Surely Palia has many activities and skills to improve, radiant graphics and more or less big world. The NPC are cute too.\nBut... It lack of something... I've tried to analyze it and I've came to this list:\n1. Lack of color. \nIt's maybe funny, but Palia, despite of all the cozy landscapes, are mostly in two colors. Green, blue, a little bit of orange. That's all. No more differences. All tree leaves (except the said orange ones) are green. All grass are green. Flowers are rare and hard to notice. I need more colors! More contrast! It's a forest after all, where all the beauty?\n2. The claustrophobia thing. \nYour house is located in a place surrounded by fence, by the forest AND by the mountains! Even location outside the city surrounded by the mountains! I know devs are trying to locate the end of the map by that, but PLEASE find another way, it making me sick by all this height above me! You could've add ocean, cliffs, I don't know, CANYONS, but all you choose is rocks. Booriiing! (Oh yeah sorry, forgot about one ocean in one part of the city, my dearest apologies)\n3. Maybe lack of realism.\nYou don't need to sleep, you don't need to eat, you even don't have any health bar. Wolfs are running from you, the night is as bright as a day, I didn't even notice any light sources. What's that, a child game? MAYBE, but no child game are providing killing animals with arrows and harvesting MEAT from it. Even if you try to disguise it with a bag, haha, you think children are stupid? Give adult people more hardcore, I want to feel the game and my character, not just run all day by some created 3D model that has no limits! Even Minecraft has limits (hunger it is)! \n\nIn the end, the game maaaaybe good to relax, but it doesn't provide anything more. You just need to run all day ('cause you don't need to sleep), harvest everything you can and do the quests. Which there a LOT. It feels like I'm on a job and have to work day, and day, and day, and day. The difference is that I receive money by that and here I receive only more quests :D I'm scared to even open my journal, cause it filled by them, but Palia is always reminding me about my job by showing all the quests in a right side of my monitor. It's scary... \n\nLong story short, it's a game about countless hours of run errands and visibility of freedom. If you tired of doing your real job, you can change it by doing virtual job! Thrilling, isn't it? If you like that assignment, please buy Palia! Otherwise, make your decision by more relaxing games.",

The game’s whimsical art style, charming world, and emphasis on collaboration over competition set it apart in a genre dominated by high-octane action.\n\nVisuals and Atmosphere: One of the strongest aspects of Palia is its visual presentation. The art style is bright, colorful, and reminiscent of Ghibli films, with lush forests, tranquil lakes, and detailed towns. The characters and environments are beautifully crafted, giving the game a whimsical, warm aesthetic that draws players in. The soundtrack complements this atmosphere perfectly, with gentle, calming music that helps maintain the relaxed pace.\n\nGameplay: Palia centers around life skills such as cooking, farming, fishing, and crafting. The game doesn't focus on combat or conflict, making it a relaxing experience for those looking for a more casual MMO. Players work together to build homes, gather resources, and complete quests that encourage collaboration rather than competition.\n\nThe progression system feels rewarding without being grindy. As players improve their skills, they unlock new recipes, tools, and customization options. The crafting and farming systems are intuitive, and the world provides ample opportunities to explore, gather resources, and discover new areas. However, after several hours, some players may find the gameplay loops repetitive, especially those who are accustomed to more complex MMOs.\n\nCommunity and Social Features: Palia shines in its social aspect. It encourages players to form friendships and work together on large projects. Community events and co-op activities foster a sense of belonging, and the world is designed to be a shared experience. Players can visit each other’s homes, help with crafting or farming, and participate in large-scale events.\n\nThere’s also an emphasis on NPC interactions, with a rich cast of characters to befriend. The dialogue and relationship-building mechanics are engaging, and the NPCs have distinct personalities that make interactions feel meaningful. Romanceable NPCs add a layer of depth, though the relationship system is still somewhat basic in its current form.\n\nRoom for Improvement: Despite its charm, Palia isn’t without its flaws. The game could benefit from more content diversity. After mastering the available skills, there’s a lack of end-game content, which could make long-term play feel stagnant. Adding new activities, quests, and crafting options would help sustain interest over time.\n\nAdditionally, while the game runs smoothly for the most part, there are occasional bugs and glitches, such as resource spawn issues or server hiccups, which can disrupt gameplay. The developers have been responsive to feedback, so future updates may address these concerns.\n\nConclusion: Palia is a refreshing, tranquil take on the MMO genre, providing a peaceful, non-combat experience that’s perfect for players seeking a slower-paced, community-driven game. Its cozy aesthetic, focus on social interaction, and simple yet engaging gameplay mechanics make it a joy to play, especially for fans of life simulation games. While it lacks some depth in terms of end-game content, and there’s room for expansion, Palia is a promising and delightful entry into the genre.\n\nIf you're looking for an MMO that’s more about building friendships and relaxing than grinding levels or fighting bosses, Palia is worth checking out.",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-13)](https://steam/76561198385492761)\nA fine mix between animal crossing and stardew valley imo. Very fun to play with friends and exciting to see everyones creativity in world.",
      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-24)](https://steam/76561198107467511)\nWhile I've been having fun playing this game solo (ignoring the bugs and crashes), I can't give it a thumbs up. \nTheir marketing team/board members decided to implement some scummy tactics like MACRO transactions, and purchasing a in-game currency, as well as forcing you to buy more of that currency than you need, so you always end up paying more. \n\nFor a game that isn't even finished, this is insane. I wouldn't mind spending like 5eur on a skin, but 40 eur for one outfit or 10 eur for a pet is absolutely insane. Blocking players from earning anything themselves in terms of cosmetics is a major major downside and really greedy. Animal crossing does this in a much better way. \n\nI would much rather spend 40 euros once to buy the game than spend thousands just trying to buy the cosmetics. That's some EA garbage right there. And its sad because you can see the writers and artists and devs did put a lot of effort into making a cute game.\n\nThe multiplayer part also feels very half-a$sed. Yes, theres a chat and you see players running around. You can group up with a friend and see their location. But that's about it. No quest sync, no trading with friends, no mailing friends items, no dungeons or group content, you can't see each other when you're in a temple,  you can't even plant seeds for a friend. what is the point? It seems like the MMO part is just a marketing buzzword. It's about as multiplayer as elden ring is.",
      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-10)](https://steam/76561198064078023)\n1. There are no horses. Or any other mounts. How is one supposed to have a wholesome farm experience without any horses? \n\n2. The cooking mini game is the most boring and unsatisfying one i've seen in a game. I wish they'd take notes from Immortal Life, or Kynseed.\n\n3. The quests are few and far between. The world isn't living with no quests.\n\n4. The devs get no profit from designing interesting quests, or writing deep characters. All their profit comes from selling cosmetics on their immersion-breaking store for a lot of money. \n\nUnless they add some subscription option, I don't expect any quality content to be created. \n\nMore on that:\nThis game was marketed as wholesome and cozy, with healthy practices. The devs seemed like there was actually some love in the project, and were interested in making a good game for a wholesome, cozy experience. \n\nThe first red flag was the \"free to play\". No option was even offered to players to buy the game at a fair price, and/or opt to pay for a subscription and then enjoy a complete, immersive world without FOMO, tricks, predatory and stressful microtransactions, and the constant reminder of greed breathing down your neck.\n\nThe game doesn't feel wholesome. It feels superficial, and put together for the sole purpose of greed. The microtransactions are integrated in the game, in a way that kills any immersion or wholesomeness one could hope to find in a fantasy world. \n\nI haven't followed the whole drama, but i did see the trailers and marketing prior to releasing the beta, and trying out the game a year later, it was difficult to imagine that the game in that was marketed was this game i was experiencing. From what I read other people saying online, there's been a lot of drama during that year i missed. Many people blame Palia's devs for lies, unmet promises and a clear indication that this is not the wholesome feel-good game it was marketed to be, just another greedy game with no love in the making whatsoever. \n\nI guess we'll have to wait a little longer for the real deal. Too bad.",

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-01)](https://steam/76561198097422190)\nAbsolutely love this game. The quests are so in depth, the environments are beautiful, I love the skilling. It's great",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-01)](https://steam/76561199112247227)\nWhat a game!!! It definitely still has stuff to improve and bugs to be fixed, but the game play style alongside an engaging story that gives you the freedom to progress at your own pace and the social/collaborative nature of the game with fellow members of the server makes those \"negatives\" almost insignificant.\r\n\r\n If I had to ask for something it would be to give us creative freedom in certain aspects of decoration positioning which might sound like asking too much given the magnitude of improvements that can already be done to our plot. However sometimes the limitations on where an object can be placed or not inside the grid, or the lack of angles, or objects not interacting well with the surroundings do cut us short from the cozy building experience.  It would also be great if we could move the mail box and selling container to anywhere in the plot as it is a bit annoying not been able to change the way the entrance looks.\r\n\r\nWhen playing in a party with a friend, it is often that we lose sight of each other and our friend's character seems to disappear as we run around. The same way our character disappears from our friend's perspective and can result to be confusing as we try to follow each other. There is a serious need of a mini map as well! Having to rely on clicking M to open the big map limits our ability to keep moving as we locate a place. \r\n\r\nOverall the game is super fun whether you have friends to play with or not. The online open multiplayer server allows you to chat with others, ask for help, request needed items for quests or personal use, create a community and make new friends as you discover all the secrets hiding in Palia! Don't let the need for minor fixes in a game that is still in development discourage you from having a wonderful time! The game is totally worth the hype!",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-24)](https://steam/76561198203136301)\nCute little game inspired by often used Gamemechanics, which isnt bad at all. Its the perfect game for me to relax from the day. I love the fact that such a huge world is free.",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-12)](https://steam/76561197989194890)\nOccasionally buggy, quite often laggy, but it *is* still in beta.\r\n\r\nThe graphics are decent, it will run on a relatively low-spec machine quite easily, and the style is cute and consistent.\r\n\r\nThe initial quests are a little repetitive, but once you start to poke into the main story and the NPC stories it becomes very absorbing quite quickly. In fact the writing for some of the NPC stories is absolutely brilliant, as is the animation for certain characters and their body language (all of the NPCs feel well written and well fleshed out, they all have motivations and solid backstories, it's really good in most cases).\r\n\r\nThere is a certain level of grinding (chop trees, mine rocks, grow crops) but it's on the level of Stardew and it's easy to know what to do. The in-game community is generally friendly and will help out with problems, questions, fetch-quests and so on. A few quests are not very clear about what you need to do at certain points, but again the community will help if they can, and there's a good wiki online with pointers.\r\n\r\nIt needs some polishing, but there's content updates ongoing and it feels like a game that should be brilliant by the time it hits full release.",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-30)](https://steam/76561198026955611)\nLovely game that scratches the Stardew/Sandrock cozy itch with a fun and kind fantasy world. This is one of the most co-operative games I've ever played with quests, gathering, and cooking encouraging you to play with others to enjoy bonuses for everyone. I never felt the need to pay for any cosmetics, and many of them you can get for free through achievements and quests.\r\n\r\nFor a free game, I can recommend trying it to anyone who likes cozy games and enjoys playing games with others.",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-30)](https://steam/76561198161269536)\nStory is good, skills and farming are good, designing and creating your own place is great! Overall this game is relaxing and no time pressure.",
      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-30)](https://steam/76561199525711014)\nTried it with ma lil cousin, looked cozy and all and we promised us a cozy Building/exploring game from it with some quest, but well, its is a building and exploring game. With a TINY map, weird quests and boring npcs, no real game mechanics or story whatsoever and maybe , just maybe we would have tried it a bit more if we wouldnt have fallen trough the ground all the time, or just randomly being able to walk out of bounds and leave the map due to everything losing its collisions. It seems and feels like a weird and buggy mobile game and i do not recommend. Oh and did i mention you need to give em your email to play?! yeah, not recommended",

The only time you have to spend \"real money\" is when you purchase clothing, tool skins, glider skins, and animal creatures,, etc...from the Premium shop. Which honestly, is such a sigh of relief. \n\nI'm so exhausted of buying battle passes, event passes...anything passes; where it stops being free-to-play and becomes more FOMO-enraging. There are some items I can no longer get in Palia, and I'm fine for now. I'm hoping Palia will re-release some skins if there is another opportunity to get them. Especially with newer players joining up now. \n\nGardening is so much fun, and decorating my home is on another level. \n\nI think so far the only con I have about the game is I wish there was more to do. I also wish you can craft the modification item to change the color of furniture. I really dislike running all the way to kilima village and purchasing them at tish's shop to then going alllllllll the way back home. Two loading screens later, I just sigh cause it takes so much time.",

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-28)](https://steam/76561198014030732)\nPalia is a fantastic game that I've played mostly off steam, I stopped playing after a couple months and have recently come back. There are a lot of great new changes mostly revolving around the game being more friendly to get rare resources. \n\nThere is loads of things to do and to grind for, with a huge focus on community and player friendship. Over the year there still aren't many \"new\" things to do or new zones which does mean that the game gets stale still a year later after playing it for a week or so in a row.\n\nOne thing that's a really big negative that almost made me change my review is that there are a lot of community rules that aren't stated anywhere other than in the brains of the people who follow them and/or have played long enough to know them, Not knowing these rules such as Cutting flow tree groves at 3am in game time caused a large argument on the server today with me cutting too early, I did not know and wasn't told but broke some scared rule that caused a player to hurl abuse at me over chat for 20 mins. \n\nIf the community is going to create rules that are expected to be followed the developers should perhaps put these into the in game loading screens or tool-tips once they become expected. \n\nI've had these negative experiences with more players then I'd expect to for a game that at it's core is a \"Cozy MMO\".\n\nOther then this the game is really nice and the community as a whole has be wonderful.",

Everything from the world to the characters, graphics and story is so well done. Gameplay provides plenty of variety. You can collect insects, do combat, or focus on gathering and building if you so please, something that I've wished more games like this would offer. You can even build friendships and romance the other characters. This game truly has it all. Not a huge fan of having to pay for cosmetics and skins rather than earning them though. The one major gripe that I have with the game however, is the fact that it's online only. As others have said, this game really doesn't feel like it should be a multiplayer game. The servers don't seem to be too populated and the socialization between other players is nearly nonexistent aside from a few people sharing tips here and there. I think it would've been a better idea to make the game singeplayer and give those who wish to play with others the ability to create a server that others can join, similar to Palworld and Genshin, that way players don't have to rely on being connected to wifi to be able to play. The game truly doesn't need to be multiplayer in my opinion. Aside from that though, it would also be nice to have the ability to sit in chairs and benches as others have said.",

I'm honestly pretty impressed. As a big fan of simple cozy games, this game has definitely pulled me in. I'm excited to see what's to come in the future.\nOnly real gripe so far is just that I wish there were at least some options outside of the premium store to buy clothes and whatnot as I'm not the biggest fan of the base game clothes personally. On the other hand, as long as cosmetics are the only microtransactions, I can't complain too much.",

All of my free time goes into Palia either by hunting, foraging, mining, fishing, gardening, decorating my plots, completing npc/storyline quests, romancing npcs, or playing the addicting game of hot pot. You can collect plushies, and all the star quality fish, bugs, and starstones to display in your house for others to see. The community of players are super friendly and helpful to those who are new to the game. And I love how Palia implements the use of \"teamwork\"(what I refer to it as) where you can party with others to get the same drops from hunting or foraging. Not to mention the use of having flow trees that require multiple players to chop in order to obtain it's wood. There is an endless amount of things to do in this game, all at your own pace. So if you love mmorpgs, farming games, and a nice, relaxing game to hop on after a long day, Palia is definitely for you! :)",

Other mechanics like mining or building stuff reminds me of palworld/osrs but without the boredom that comes with those games.\n\nEverything is so nice in this game, NPCs and people are kind. As a former league player I'm surprised that this is actually possible. Oooh the NPC dialogs are so fun! I enjoy reading the quests storylines. I feel connected to them, they are not generic as most of MMOs out there (go to point A take item X deliver to point B).\n\nThe game reminds you of drinking water IRL and the other messages are very kind/positive. \n\nWhat a gem.

Also, this community is so friendly and informative, I haven't really seen any gatekeeping at all.

Reading Discord and other Forums, it seems they are slow to add any real expansion and have only added visual content since the Beta Release. The Update today even speaks of \"bringing back\", instead of \"look at all the new content\".\r\n\r\nThere are things you will wish you knew before you spend any Real World Cash, like buying the Plot Backgrounds, because you only get 2 free Plots, and it is the most expensive thing in game to have to purchase. I spent $80 in RWC, to find out that I still will have to work, virtually forever, to get the in-game Coin to purchase the additional Plots to show off my $80 investment in the game.\r\n\r\nI do not like that it is similar to a Browser Game, in that every time you purchase a Plot Item, the price goes up, SIGNIFICANTLY. You get NOTHING better, bigger or new, in fact, you only have 2 Main House Options even available, right now. Browser Games sell In-Game Coin for Real World Cash, but you cannot purchase Coin in this game.\r\n\r\nI am holding out hope that it grows and expands in the very near future, but I am still having fun, and there are some neat ways to decorate that are keeping me busy, for now.",

Players call out and mark rare spawns of ore, trees, plants and critters and wait for others to arrive. There's a gifting system where players help each other out with items they have had in the past but need now.  You can decorate your home plot with thousands of items from drops to different buildings and recently added building blocks. I've seen fortresses, castles and custom homes. There are bugs like any other EA game. The cash shop is a bit overpriced IMO, but only contains companion pets, cosmetics and skins so nothing in the shop is mandatory to buy to enjoy the game.",

The interactions with the npc's are fun and refreshing when their dialog changes depending on how you answer their questions. It is refreshing and more dynamic. The grind portion is not easy but it puts you in a slow pace to take it slow and relax. It has great creation dynamics to allow many possibilities to make your land unique for yourself. The main in game purchase is purely cosmetical but the entire gameplay itself is free and refreshing from games that are either pay to play or games that make you pay to get items. the prices are not unreasonable and prices for items with in game gold scales to how much money you should be making at that time using your level for each area to keep a want to work on skills but is not a full requirment to gatekeep from progressing. As well this game is great both solo and multiplayer in a very helpful community. The crossplatform progression is also a nice detail that works very smoothly.\r\n\r\nGame function flaws would be an occasonal crashs if multiple programs are running, only once but a flaw with the character appearing diffrent from original, most bugs were more so able to fix quickly.",

I genuinely enjoy *every single* NPC in this game, which is not something I have ever felt about another farm sim (despite having played a LOT of them!). I have literally cried over the back story and trauma some of these characters have shared with me, especially because the writing in the dialogue often is so well-written that it feels clear that it must have come from writers who truly empathized or had even experienced some of those things.

Hours and hours of fun and wonderful people to play with, it's perfect. \n\nMy biggest complaint is the storage space. 8 chests, even upgraded, is nowhere near enough when you get to late game. I greatly appreciate stuff like furniture not taking up space, but that is kind of expected since you can't sell it, which also sucks.\n\nAnd the other main complaint is that the controller support, while functioning and decent, it's still not great yet. Many features still require you to use your keyboard and sometimes the controller functions stop working for 1 button, like jumping or sprinting which can be frustrating if you are trying to do a jumping puzzle. \n\nAlso the last tiny complaint is that trying to set up the kitchen stuff is a nightmare. It will tell you that you don't have a stove when you have 2. What it means is you don't have a stove that you havn't unlocked yet. It took me so long to figure this out for petit fives that it means the NEXT step up from a stove that you initially start with. It was hours of headache and just sucked.\n\nOtherwise I really do enjoy playing Palia, I just hope with further work and additions that the storage, kitchen and controller's features will improve.",

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-19)](https://steam/76561198118238232)\nI've been playing Palia for a few months now, and I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical at first, being an MMO, which I had deliberately stayed away from for years. However, this is unlike any MMO I've ever played before. There is no combat, no enemies, and group play is highly encouraged. There is also no player economy, only that between you and the NPCs. \n\nMain Goals: Building your dream home in your own housing plot is the ultimate goal. And this is actually where the game starts you off. The quests are definitely worth doing for both the story line and the rewards. They opens up parts of the game you wouldn't be able to access otherwise, and many of the rewards include decor items absolutely worth having. Building friendships with the NPCs is equally important, and very similar to Stardew Valley, Garden  Paws, and the My Time at Portia game series, among others, I'm sure. The rewards for these in Palia, though, feel much more rewarding. \n\nGroup play: playing in parties has its perks; everyone gets the same loot as long as you're within a certain range of one another. However, it's not completely necessary. If you and another player hit the same rock, node, tree, game animal, etc., at the same time, you both contribute to \"tagging\" it, and you both get loot. Fishing has a bonus, too, when fishing near other players.\n\nGifting: Another aspect of group play, in regards to player economy is the gifting system. There's no trading, such as between players directly or in a party, (though this has been heavily requested), but you can request items through the social tab and another player can gift it to you that way. And to help mitigate abuse of this system, there is a daily cap on how many times you can request items.\n\nThe Material Grind: This is similar to other games in that you still have to do it almost constantly, and the rarer materials, such as Palium ore, and other foraging items, make it that much more of a grind. However, group play, in parties, or just running round with other players, and call-outs to these rare locations in chat help to make this easier. There are only two main map areas at this time, as well, and certain materials are restricted to each location respectively. There is also fishing and bug catching, and both have nice perks, which I won't spoil here.\n\nFood and Crops: You have your crops you grow in your housing plot, both for selling and for making food. The food provides what the game calls \"focus\" which gives you a boost to XP while in the world farming materials and while crafting. Food and focus are both important. \n\nMaking Money: Fish, bugs, and extra crops will be your primary money makers in the beginning. Extra crafting materials are also good money makers in later game. Crafted decor items cannot be sold, but they also do not take up inventory space in your chests. \n\nCommunities: This is Palia's equivalent of Guilds. However, it's still a work in progress. There's not much to do in Communities yet, but I hear that it's getting a face-lift, so I'm excited to see what's coming for communities. Hopefully this also includes a Community Plot and daily goals. \n\nOverall I absolutely recommend this game, whether you're a seasoned MMO player, or new to MMOs, or just looking for casual group or individual play. Since there's no combat system and everyone shares materials in the world, this eliminates most of the game stress you get from more competitive MMOs. And if you do feel stressed, or need time alone, you can simply spend hours in your housing plot building your very own palace!",

It's pretty easy to pick up on, though I will forewarn that you should look into what the \"personality signs\" are and mean as sooooon as possible. It has a sprinkling of romance in the game, but honestly it's fluff. So if this sounds good to you, it's for you. ;-}",

The only thing where you would use real-life money is for outfits, skins for your tools etc. Personally, there are a lot of outfits to choose from... but the outfits and things you can buy are really cool.\r\n\r\nComplexity: The game isn't complex, I feel this game would be suitable for any age.. however, there is relationship building in the game and i am unsure if it goes to SIMS lvl of relationships.\r\n\r\nType of game: Casual MMO, similar vibes to Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley with fortnite graphics. Difference is that it has quests, and there is no health bar... so it's quite fun being able to jump off a hill because you are too lazy to run down it.\r\n\r\nOverall: This game is quite fun, there is no pressure to do anything, however, the storyline and quests are fun!",

I really appreciate that I was able to link my account from Switch so I could keep my progress, such a great feature. As far as the game itself, there is soooo much to do in this game.

I’m normally not a huge fan of grinding for materials in games, but for some reason I really enjoy it in Palia, and can spend hours just running around grinding for the different materials. \n\nI also really love the multiplayer aspect of the game. It’s such a fun game to play with friends, and I’ve already made so many friends through this game! Even without playing with friends, the multiplayer aspect is great. (Most) people in this game are so sweet and helpful, and it’s such a nice feeling to never feel alone when playing Palia.\n\nI will say that the prices for the premium clothes and accessories is way too expensive, and the free clothes in this game are very limited. I’m happy that nothing else is locked behind a paywall, but I’m really hoping to see some better prizing of the premium stuff in the future.\n\nIf you are not a mouse and keyboard player, I would suggest being it for this game.

      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-16)](https://steam/76561198121485117)\nI WANT to recommend this game. However, doing so would be setting others up for disappointment.\n\nThis game has the potential to be one of the most comfortable and relaxing MMOs to have ever been made. I truly mean that. But in order to do that it would need to be developed by an entirely new team/company, probably. \n\nThe issues:\n1. The game is so filled to the brim with glitches and game-breaking bugs that they NEVER should have even considered it past alpha. The ground will vanish. The menus will bug out. The NPCs are almost nonfunctional. The quests will bug out. The list is actually so long I won't bother. Just know that the game BARELY functions. \n\n2. The optimization of the game is ATROCIOUS. You can run all the way to the center of the (only) town in the game and the buildings will STILL be popping into existence one wall at a time with 20 second intervals between them. The town is TINY! How?! It's truly horrid.\n\n3. This is the one that pisses me off. The thing that makes me unwilling to be patient with this anymore is that they continue to push out CONSTANT updates. \"For what?\" you may ask. \n\n[h1] IN-GAME PURCHASES and MICROTRANSACTIONS BAAAABBYYYYY [/h1] \n\nIt's the ONLY THING they care AT ALL about. They make it more and more clear as they keep releasing more real-money skins into the game. (Funny too because even these are bugged as hell. They glitch into themselves and look just truly terrible.)\n\nMy wife and I have played a lot of this game. (Mostly on Switch...which...lol don't bother...) We really were loving the comfortable relax vibes as we tried to wind down at the end of the evening. But the game has become steadily more unplayable and just filled to the brim with microtransactions. \n\nWant this game to succeed? Fire the team making these decisions and get better programmers. Until then this looks like a cash grab of the laziest nature. \n\nEdit just to add: If you try to bring up any of your concerns with this game to it's community you will be shouted down and removed from any of their communities you bring it up in. It doesn't matter how civil you try to be about it when expressing genuine concerns. For such a cozy game and a (normally) super positive community they DO NOT like when you ask questions like 'Why are the buildings not loading in anymore?\" I don't understand the zealous nature of the defense of this particular game by its players but it's kind of weird.\n\nEdit 2: Right after posting this review they released more patches. Not only did they not fix any of their old bugs in these AND add more bugs, but they also made sure to let everyone know they have more cosmetics to buy! \n\nI am so disappointed. This isn't a game. It is a cosmetics shop hunting for whales with a \"game\" around it as an afterthought. I really wish this game was developed by someone with integrity and standards because it could be so good.",

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-16)](https://steam/76561198040751181)\nDo you like Breath of the Wild and wish it were multiplayer and more laid back? Do you like Animal Crossing and wish to have more freedom with how you place your decor? Do you enjoy farm sim games like Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley, or Fields of Mistria and wish it were a 3D title instead?\r\n\r\nThen allow me to introduce you to Palia!\r\n\r\nCurrently in Beta and free to play with cosmetic options for those who like some icing on the cake, Palia is perfect for anyone who wants a casual farm sim/adventuring MMO with low stakes and a lot of heart. It's very forgiving in terms of game play, where even in situations where you can die, death is not a huge setback. This is a boon to those who aren't talented in platforming, which is an aspect of the game critical to advancing the main story quest line.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of this game I specifically enjoy are the characters. They're beautifully rendered, and every single npc has something going on. From the hard-on-their-luck farming family, to the mayor's dysfunctional home, the variety and intricacies of the social circles in Palia fascinate me. As someone who yearns for variety in character design, this game is a breath of fresh air. I only wish the dating pool in Palia were a bit broader!\r\n\r\nAs this game is still in beta, there are some areas of the game that could use improvement. As previously mentioned, I would enjoy seeing more bachelors and bachelorettes added to the roster. Sifuu, Ashura, and Zeki come to mind. Yes, even though some people might find them abrasive. Okay, this includes Eloise and Caleri too. Could be fun romance paths, after all.\r\nAnother aspect I have found a little frustrating is that sometimes, quests aren't clear about the next step to take. I understand this can be used to encourage exploring. When it works, quests feel like they have a snowballing effect that's naturally rewarding. Being stymied because an objective was just a little too obtuse (and don't get me wrong, I'm a veteran of point and click adventure games so obtuse solutions aren't a deal breaker for me) can be a turn off. Hopefully the devs smooth this part out a bit. I can see it negatively impacting gameplay for some folks.\r\n\r\nLet's wrap this up with talking about the building aspect. Progression through crafting trees are fairly straightforward: gather materials, craft, invent (or buy) new recipes, and repeat. Progress rarely feels like a grind. Although there are some aspects that make a player slow down, such as when items are in a smelter or other materials processing, I find it balances out so you're freed up to go out into the world again.\r\n\r\nTL:DR; Great casual social game for folks who like farm sims with a little bit of intrigue. I think I'll be playing this one for hundreds of hours into the future.",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-16)](https://steam/76561198797595311)\nFun and exciting game play and story line. Some glitches but that's to be expected with beta testing. Some things that I wish could be added were 1. more facial feature characterization options. Right now the facial features are limited into the selection of head shape (choosing a head shape comes with eyes, nose and lips already pre-selected with that particular head shape). It would be nice to be able to choose your own eyebrow shape, eye shape, lip shape, etc. 2. Another thing that was hard for me to adjust to was trying to find people for quests. It might be nice to add a hint of when said person would out in the time of day or where to look for them. Granted most people you talk to who send you to go look for someone will tell you, but I can't tell you how many times I went looking for Hodori not being able to find him on the map. Which leads me to my next suggestion. 3. It would be nice to have a visual in-game other than the compass above the screen. Like a trail of mystical glitter to follow when you set a way-point. These are honestly my only pet peeves and they are small but the way-point one was very frustrating for me. I have ADHD and Autism so my brain gets easily distracted but wants to find the fastest route which sometimes makes it take longer to find someone--and the more I mess up the more overstimulated I become because I can't find what I'm looking for. It just makes for a not fun internal situation I have to handle over something someone who doesn't struggle with what I do might not. Definitely a fun game that I look forward to seeing the further development of and see how things unfold.",

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-16)](https://steam/76561198053548327)\nPalia is probably the coziest of cozy games with a world that's rich in lore but not quite fully fleshed out yet, but with each update usually comes new content that adds to the world's lore. I like to think of it as a cross between games like Harvest Moon, Story of Seasons, Stardew Valley, and Animal Crossing. There's plenty of skills to learn and master, tools to upgrade, and achievements to be had. Partying up is the best way to play this game not only because it's fun, but with more people, you reap more rewards. It's free to play too with the optional cosmetic purchases for your character and your plot, so if you're interested, definitely give it a whirl. You might find that you very much enjoy it.",

My first ever, 'cozy', type of game, so mostly just building up life skills and running quests. \n\nLeveling up your skills of course gets tougher the more you level up, so there is quite a bit of grind, especially if you add in grinding for money. \n\nThe climbing system can be a bit glitchy and can be frustrating when trying to climb something but your character pulls out their glider instead. \n\nCommunity seems friendly and I appreciate the etiquette when it comes to chopping down flow trees and/or palium. The server always seems to be active, so you never really feel like you're playing alone (which is something I liked about Once Human, but that game appears to have died).\n\nNot bad for a free game. Apparently the last big update had more to do with adding more cash shop items than it did actually fixing bugs and improving QOL issues, so take it for what its worth.

The game gives me Animal Crossing NH vibes in the similar ways that I catch bugs, fish, garden, gather rss, decorate and even build relationships with the npcs. I have completed the story up to where it currently is and though I know a lot of people want more, as do I, I understand the game is still very early on in its development with a fairly small team. The devs are pretty transparent with what's going on at any given time (they are pretty active on their discord). Between twitch drops and event gifts from the studio there has been a fair amount of additional items given to players that I think are a nice touch. Though there are glitches and bugs that happen with every patch, updates are fairly regular imo with one pretty much monthly that adds a decent amount of features plus fixes to the game. Considering it's a free game it is hard to argue that it's not worth it, even if you only play until the current content runs out, I think the overall design of the game and gameplay will draw back existing players as the game expands (elderwoods etc). It has been fun to meet some cool people through the game too since it is so socially driven. I also enjoy streaming it and watching other streamers play it, I think there is a lot of potential for big group events within communities who play together (though party limit is currently 4).",

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-13)](https://steam/76561198352860991)\nVery fun, engaging, and relaxing game that is hard to stop playing. Similar games can not compete with Palia. The game is well balanced, has easy and fun features to use, and nearly endless room for creativity. Exploring Palia and playing with friends is easy, fun, and even has it bonuses. There are so many neat aspects to the game, it feels like you are playing multiple A+ games. I hope they continue adding to this game because the formula they have here is perfect.",

Came back after craving farming. This game is still worked on so if you're like me when you do come back there's something new to do. I was worried that this game was abandon but no! there's way more players than I remember playing with before. Everyone is extremely nice and helpful. Especially when cutting down flow trees. \n\nI play on pc and switch. This game is pretty easy to go back and forth with which is really nice. Both have their pros and con. Switch I find cooking, and fishing to be easier to do. While I find on pc hunting and bug catching easier. My switch is older so it doesn't run that well graphics wise with this game but I take that L if it means I can lay down playing before bed. \n \nThe only money you can spend on this free game is on outfits. I respect the hustle and if you got to make money somewhere that's the best case. \n\nMy only complaint is I find getting the rare fish and bugs for the bundles quest hard to fulfilled.

I have to say, in the MMO aspect of the game, you might not find yourself interacting much with other people, but when you do the community is nice and will help you out if you need guidance.

Its a great idea and i can see it being fun for majority of people (personally not my type of game, pretty much for little kids and should have stayed on switch). However, here's my problems with it:\n\n- To actually login to make a Palia account (if u decide to), you need to change a few keys. Even when using a PC layout it didn't recognise the mouse or keyboard. If you're on steam deck, it is playable but the controls are weird af.\n\n- Character customisation is buggy, constantly changing for example a characters shirt even though u didn't click anything. This made the process longer.\n\n- Game play at first was attractive, but past that first stage, its rather boring. There's nothing attractive other than it being apparently a cozy game. I want missions and the ability to do whatever but the tutorial is long af, unoriginal characters, long and generic conversations, and...no..its boring.",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-10)](https://steam/76561198415048469)\nIt really is a nice game. It's free to play and does not pester you with sales and dubious offers. Gameplay is fun. There is no combat (afaIk), and skill progression is smooth. You can talk to villagers, fulfill quests and become friends. There is a main story, but there is no urgency to it. Basically, you can just collect resources and build a nice little home. The map is big enough to allow some exploring, yet small enough to constantly see other players. I think that the co-op aspect could still be fleshed out a little. Other than playing some mini-games or gathering resources even quicker, there does not seem to be much benefit to working together right now.",

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-09)](https://steam/76561198089381531)\nTL;DR: If you can look past some heavy, heavy bugs, the game's surprisingly deep writing and elaborate systems make it a charming, absorbing experience.\r\n\r\nI had been playing for about 4 hours when I feel under a house; something about the steps not loading correctly. The unstuck function did nothing, neither did restarting the game. Luckily, the map has a teleporting function that I could use to return home and, next time I wandered into town, everything had loaded correctly and no issues happened. I continued to play around and have fun until about  a couple hours later, when it happened again. This time, my teleport button was on cooldown (what the heck!?) and I had to stop playing because I couldn't get out from under the house.\r\n\r\nI was incredibly pissed and considering stopping for good, but this was proof that the game already had its claws on me. I was enjoying interacting with the towns-folk, all pretty stereotypical on the surface but with hidden depths which are revealed organically through talking to them and finishing missions. The many systems of the game are engrossing and interesting: fishing is not limited to pushing a button when the fish bites, cooking is not limited to adding the correct ingredients. The sense of progression feels very real, both by missions slowly unlocking one another and new systems and gadgets becoming available, and made me want to keep playing to see what unlocks next. I have a couple of minor gripes, but they're far, far outweighed by the amount of Good Brain Juice™ I get from playing.\r\n\r\nThe MMO aspect feels a bit undercooked, but it definitely fosters a friendly environment for interactions, and I think that's the most important part of it. \r\n\r\nOverall, I'll keep playing Palia as much as I can, until I inevitably fall through the ground into a limbo from which there's no escape.",
      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-09)](https://steam/76561198244128312)\nPalia is an exact copy of Disney Dreamlight Valley, but without Disney people.\nS6 released this game about 7 months after Disney Dreamlight Valley was released. Pretty sure its a \"Free\" knockoff from that other game.\nI'm never playing this or supporting the devs again because of how much BullS*** this game is.\n\nFull of bugs, terrible netcode, over a hundred hours wasted on just trying to play the game normally via the Story (that I cant finish CAUSE of bugs.) that should have been fixed MONTHS AGO but still has a FEW fun elements.\nNot only do they just release $50 skins and one (MAYBE two) bug fixes every few months, they rebranded their ENTIRE company to hide the past failure games they've made. MOBILE GAMES.\n\nI personally Invested over $100 into this games cosmetics, and theres been no actual fixes to the game/netcode that actually matter. (THIS GAME IS VERY EASY TO EXPLOIT)\n\nTheir Social tab is a joke, it never saves parties (friend requests are always broken), chat is always down etc.\nTheir company seems to only put effort into their Assets, and NOT into the actual game servers. (which, has NO CLOUDFLARE protection btw, so their servers could be DDosed VERY easily.\n\nI love the feel of the game regardless of the bugs, but since I learned about \"Disney Dreamlight Valley\" being released first, I wont be playing this anymore or supporting the devs.\nThey keep teasing a new area, but theres no leaks, or even teaser images. Once you complete the Story (in about a Week of playing in hours) and get the highest tools, there's NOTHING TO DO.\n\nGive it a try, but good luck running it, it takes a NASA super computer to play it at an OK framerate with the version of Unreal 5 their running at MEDIUM or LOW settings!!!",

So it's more like 40+ hours)\r\n\r\nPalia is a nice, low stress, farm-ing type MMO-esque game. It's pretty alright.\r\nBut honestly, that's about the extent I can talk about this game.\r\nBecause outside of a few small niche things (Bug catching is like throwing Pokeballs) it really doesn't do much that you can't get from other farming village games. If Palia wasn't f2p, I'd probably not recommend it, but as it has no cost of entry, I'll just say: Try it for yourself.\r\n\r\nIf I had to give a reason for why I wouldn't recommend it, well, just that the game feels very shallow, and you're brick walled by so many timers, meaning you've basically got to wait a while before making very minor progressions. Means that your progression is stretched out over very little content, and when you try to engage with the content, you find out pretty quickly there's little to none of it.\r\n\r\nI stopped playing for something like a year a while back, and came back recently to see what was new, and honestly? Almost nothing substantial, but the number of items in the store has increased by like 400%. \r\nThe game honestly feels like it's a monetised time sink than a genuine experience, which is rather disappointing.\r\nPlenty of potential, not so much of it realised.\r\n\r\nTry it for yourself, but don't hold your breath.",

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-07)](https://steam/76561198057253505)\nIf Stardew Valley is to be considered as a cozy game, than Palia is... dreamy?\r\n\r\nDespite playing SV for hunderds of hours with my wife, I would never play this kind of games on my own. Too peaceful. too quiet, too slow. Yet Palia somehow combined everything that I love almost on instinct level from other games and just smashed a \"farm sim\" sticker on it. \r\n- Platforming and adventure-ish gameplay approach like in Zelda? Check. \r\n- Smooth controls, interface and social aspect remotely reminding my beloved World of Warcraft? Check.\r\n- Building system so perfect, that it looks like if Todd would give the dev team of Fallout 4 more than half-a-day to develop it? Check.\r\n- Basically, everything you need from a canonical farming/life simulator aka Stardew Valley? CHECK.\r\n\r\nThis game certainly has some grinding implemented in it, yet considering how well the world, sound and the whole vibe of this game are designed, it doesn't matter at all. You can just go with the flow, carelessly run around and do random stuff while enjoying the calming music and peaceful views and in no time you, apparently, have collected half the stuff you needed for another bundle. \r\n\r\nSurely, a decent amount of work is seen in how light and welcoming the in-game world feels. The main storyline is finely implemented in this world, it develops in front of the player with good pace and it has some sort of a mystery in it, that makes me want to find out more. But the characters are not that interesting (except for a mere couple) and they seem more generic, than writers probably wanted them to be. \r\n\r\nOverall, I am very glad that I have stumbled upon this game so randomly, and it brings me nothing but relaxation and joy so far.

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-07)](https://steam/76561198192066993)\nA little bit Stardew, a little bit Genshin, a little bit Breath of the Wild maybe, Palia has some good things going for it. It's an MMORPG with a cozy atmosphere to it. Emphasis on cozy.\r\n\r\nPROS:\r\n\r\n1) The art style is pretty. I see elements of Genshin Impact and Breath of the Wild here, but Singularity 6 makes their own artistic mark, too. It's really quite attractive. I like the little details, like that you can see the breeze blowing.\r\n2) The characters are memorable individuals with their own personalities and stories. You can even romance some of them, like Tish, the carpenter cutie.\r\n3) You can build your own homestead/dream house, and deck it out in decorations of all kinds. Want a farmhouse? A cottagecore cottage? A witchy abode? Something with fashionable chic? You can probably build it.\r\n4) There's 8 different professions you learn along the way. While some may be familiar, such as mining, some also seem unique to this game (or at least unique to a small handful of games), such as bug catching and furniture making.\r\n5) The world is interesting and beautiful. It's small, because they just released it into beta like a year ago, but it already has a thriving community. There's a bunch of how-tos on YouTube, 3 or 4 wikis, and some interactive maps online. There's currently only two adventuring zones, Kilima Valley and Bahari Bay, but Singularity 6 is working on their third: The Elderwood. Despite its small size, there's plenty to do. Decorating your homestead will keep you busy for a while just by itself.\r\n6) At least for right now, while it's in beta, Palia is free to play. No subscriptions, no season or battle passes, none of that nonsense. Just download, make a character, and get lost in this world.\r\n7) It's RELAXING. You can't die. There is no fall damage. You don't pass out like in Stardew. In fact, the late hours give you access to special materials, like magical flow wood. It's not violent, either. The hunting, for example, drops a loot bag. No skinning, or bones, or anything gross. I'm not sure if Sing-6 is going to change it (I hope not), but you can go anywhere without fear of aggroing a monster that lays you flat. It's truly relaxing.\r\n\r\nCONS:\r\n\r\n1) I'm having an issue with storage. You can get up to 5 bars in your backpack, but you run out of space quick. You start with 3, I believe, the 4th one is 5K gold, and the 5th is a whopping 25K gold (I'm having some trouble building up that amount. You know how you can make and utilize as many storage chests as you want in Minecraft? Not in Palia. You can only set down eight, and they fill up rapidly. Hoarding stuff for cooking or furniture making is difficult, because it all takes up precious space. I'm hoping they fix this soon. I'd like to build a storage warehouse on my land.\r\n2) There's some place you can get stuck, which has happened to me a few times. They have a button on the main menu for a stuck character, so that's good. But, it's still annoying. I've also seen other players sink into the ground a little. Occasionally, an NPC appears to have a pathing problem, where their walking becomes stuttered or they scooch along the ground without moving. Again, beta.\r\n3) They have a lot of interesting outfits and stuff in the game store. As far as I can tell, none of it is game-changing, so no pay-to-win. It's all just cosmetic. However, more than a few people have mentioned it being a little spendy, so you have to decide whether it's worth it if you're thinking of buying something. I think it's how they make their revenue, because the game is free to play right now. I'm not sure how else they make money.\r\n4) The progression feels a little slow, but since the world is still small, the rate of progression might be a good thing right now. After profession level 5, hunting, fishing, foraging, mining, and bug-catching seem to slow down a lot. A little patience is necessary, but the pace isn't insurmountable. They may tweek it a bit when the world gets bigger, and they finish with beta testing.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I love this game. I've only been playing for maybe 3 weeks, and I immediately fell in love with it. It's cozy enough to be called a cozy game, but there are some challenging aspects to it. I look forward to what Sing-6 comes up with. They seem to care about their work and the players. Let's hope that attitude continues, and they don't someday succumb to Triple-A Mentality.\r\n\r\nGive it a try! If you don't like it, if it's not for you, you haven't lost any money. But you might just gain a new favorite world to chill in.",

Even then, there's still plenty to do. The only thing you need to pay for is cosmetic items, which honestly is understandable since the game is free. The characters are enjoyable and have a lot of personality, and the game actually rewards you for playing with a group (though it's not required)!",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-06)](https://steam/76561198821606216)\nPalia is a very good game. It's kind of like Stardew Valley and Runescape. If you like either one, I suggest you give Palia a try. It's completely free, as well, except for cosmetics. Unfortunately, there are no cosmetics that aren't real money. The style is pretty and the characters are charming.",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-06)](https://steam/76561198068657770)\nPalia is a great game both at first glance and otherwise. Word of warning, if you like fast paced combat, non-stop action, and strategy this is not the game for you. If you however like peaceful venues, meditative music, great roleplay, and having fun with your friends this game has it all. You can build your own houses, you can have a bit of romance if you want, you can explore the entire map freely, and build all the furniture there is in the game and decorations. There are rewards for completing tasks and leveling sills, and trophies for hitting milestones. This is a lot of content considering that this game is still in beta. This game developer is clearly in it for the right reason, they clearly know what their audience wants, and they are promising more content to come... in fact their most recent patch added MORE furniture you can craft and collect. Despite not having any fast paced action I have already spent 172 hours in this game at the time of writing this review. This game makes it clear that you don't need fast paced action or strategy to enjoy a game, this is by now means a game like SWTOR, Skyrim, ESO, and The Fallout Series, and I am quite fine with that. Palia is not for fans of those franchises, and to be fair I have encountered very few bugs when compared to those games. The developers don't force you to spend money on unnecessary things to enjoy the great majority of the game, but they have this option. Most if not all of the things in this game can be crafted or bought with in game currency that you gain through in game means. WIll they at one point charge for this game? maybe but that day has not come. My belief is that they are doing fine at the moment with the players they have and with selling in game items and have no need for it at the moment. I do not foresee that this will change anytime soon but i would not mind it if it did change, because this game in every sense of the word is a paradise. It is calming and exciting, and makes me content. It is a game that is easy to play and because of it's nature there is no possibility of griefing like other games; this fosters a helpful and kind community. In conclusion is implore you, give this game a chance. You will not be sorry.",

Secondly, there is so much fun stuff to do if you enjoy cozy games like stardew valley. It reminds me a bit of Grow:Song of the Evertree,  but if you could hunt. it has a similar vibe to that game imo. \r\n\r\nEvery single person I've met on this game has been super kind and helpful. Its genuinely such a chill vibe. The downside for me is that it is a little bit glitchy at times, the party system only works half of the time, and i ruined a star quality dish because it froze the cooking animation ;-; (its hidden in my house now ^^)\r\n\r\nOverall, solid 10/10 for me. Its so fun and chill. And again, its FREE! give it a try c:",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-06)](https://steam/76561198027873444)\nDon't get me wrong, this game has is problems.\r\n\r\nThere are still things that are a bit glichy, or don't work the way you'd think they should. For instance, climbing isn't perfect. Sometimes when you glide to a wall you grip it and then fall down it a little before you start climbing. I'm not hugely fond of the trade system in the game. I understand the reason they had it set up the way they do. They are trying to prevent people from getting things they haven't gotten themselves from other players. It just makes it a little frustrating when you spend a few hours trying to catch a fish and never see it, but your friend has one they don't need. \r\n\r\nThat being said, this game has given me hours of fun fishing, mining, foraging, cooking, gardening, decorating, befriending the villagers, etc. There is so much to do, a bunch of little puzzles in the world, and over all the game play is fun. As a free to play game, I was willing to spend some money on cosmetics because I got enough enjoyment out of the game to spend it.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot to love here in a cozy game. The cooking is a lot of fun. You can cook with your friends, and each person who helped gets a stack for themselves. The fishing is relaxing, the mining/logging/foraging is straight forward and satisfying, the bug catching is fun and a nice edition to the game, and by far the best part of it all is meeting all of the villagers and building your relationship with the town. Finding out their likes and dislikes, and seeing their reaction when you gift them what they want for the week. \r\n\r\nI would say despite some of the little bugs here and there, the game itself is well worth playing.",

Everything is so smooth and thought out. Great story line and side quests and hidden content to find and complete. I only have one true issue with this game and its that fact that there just is not enough storage space, like why cap us at 8 chests? Once you get far in the game you just can't do anything without deleting your resources to add what you need for something us. For such an amazing,peaceful and just fun adventure crafting game there just isn't enough storage space to store all of the things are hording crafting hearts desire.

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-03)](https://steam/76561198137338095)\nPretty chill game. The housing customization has a good amount of freedom to it and the professions are both intertwined and can give you something to place in your house/s (for the most part, not sure if you can craft food that can be placed). The community also seems to be nice. I saw people calling for other players in chat when they see a rare resource so that others can go there and take it as well, which left an impression on me. And there\\s a gifting system where you can request for an item and others can give it to you which also encourages cooperation.\r\nGranted there are some mobile game-esque mechanics like waiting more than 10 minutes for a resource to be prepared, but you can't rush it with premium currency so I feel it's there mostly to put an emphasis on slow play, which is a good mentality to have with such games.\r\nThe game is free to play with the option to buy cosmetics so there's little reason to not try it out if one's interested.",

Started playing it with my husband and before I knew it, it had already been almost 7 hours. I will say that if they add the ability to trade with other players rather than fulfilling people's requests for items, it would be a lot better/more helpful than the current mechanic. Or at the very least allow for players to adjust the quantity and quality of items they request. \r\nStill highly recommend if you are looking for something chill and don't intend on going anywhere for a WHILE.",

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-02)](https://steam/76561198858101552)\nAn absolutely delightful game. It feels to me like somebody ran Oblivion through a Stardew Valley filter, and I love it. The NPCs are charming (many of them quite cheesy, in the absolute best way) and the design of both the village and the landscapes are as well, and the critters are varied enough to stay interesting as you explore. The quests are sometimes tricky to figure out what or where you're supposed to do and go, but the puzzles themselves are tricky enough to be pleasant without being frustrating in their difficulty or complexity. Everything seems well-paced, quests and skill-progression and character relationships. \r\n\r\nAll in all it's a wonderful experience, and the fact that the predominant attitude of the other folks playing online seem so far to be amiable has been a refreshing relief, as is the fact that the world rarely seems so crowded with other players as to overwhelm any given area. I've only been playing for a week so far, but so far I absolutely love it, and have no intention of stopping.",

I don't have any complaints at all, but I do wish that they would add a system where you can earn, craft, or buy clothing/pets (with in game currency). It doesn't have to be as fancy as the premium items, just something fun or cute. I understand the developers need to make money somehow, but it's just kinda sad, y'know?

I've been going through a rough time and my brother recommended this game as a casual and laid back experience. There's no combat, rather there are 8 skills that you can level up by using those skills. There is an adventure aspect to it, even a few \"dungeons\" which are puzzle-based, like a lighter version of a Legend of Zelda puzzle. The game does get grindy, where you need to keep fishing or catching bugs over and over, and there are a few improvements that could be made, I.E. giving residents gifts from your storage would be nice, instead of having to run back to my home, check who wants what, and pull it all out of the chests. There is a crafting aspect to the game for tool upgrades, smelting and building a home, but even that gets difficult to keep up with as things become pretty expensive pretty quickly.

Collect plushies, make money running a farm or mining, Help Hassian get rid of the invasive chappa population, find love and romance, help the black market dealer, glide around a breathtaking landscape, help your fellow townsfolk with their various tasks, learn about magic and design the house of your dreams. You must be asking, \"Nev!? Is the game appropriate for my children?!\" In my own opinion? Absolutely! But parents that is always up to you to decide, I personally know many parents who even play this game with their kids. All in all its an amazing game and I love it a lot. I mean I wouldn't have almost 200 hours and dropped $30 on cosmetics in the game if I didn't.",

It didn't like my graphics driver so i spent a half hour trying to update it. It didn't work for some reason but that's intel's fault not Palia's. I go to play the game anyway even without the best graphics and it gives me an error, I try 3 times. Looking up the error, I find that others who have tried to play Palia have been getting that error since this game was first launched with no fix or comment from the developers. Someone posted a supposed fix on reddit but it would involve changing the game start-up code and I wasn't comfortable with that. This game finished downloading at 7:30pm and i decided to just uninstall at 9:20pm. Never played. The 21 minutes was all figuring this out.",

There are better options for you out there.\n\nSome of the character designs are cool though, the fishing robot is genuinely one of the most fun designs I've seen in a while.

However, I positively despise most mechanics and other things about the game. I have played Palia on all available platforms during several different stages of its development. The developers of this game should be embarrassed at the lack of professionalism within it. The real money store is a predatory ploy for young players. The waiting periods for crafting are absurdly long and make the game feel like a mobile game. The additions to this game are extremely slow to arrive and often do not arrive on the expected date. There are frequent keybinding and clicking bugs that must be solved by players. The list goes on. I keep coming back to this game waiting for it to be something that it isn't; good. I'll probably still play as long as it's free to do so, but I do not recommend anyone getting into it at all.",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-06)](https://steam/76561198074432946)\nPalia isn’t full of brand-new game mechanics, but it combines ideas from other cozy and farming games really well. Together, they create a fun and unique experience.\r\n\r\nI really like the game’s story and how magic fits into it. There are plenty of activities like bug catching, foraging, fishing, cooking, etc. While the grind can feel long, having lots of options makes it more enjoyable. If I get bored mining, I can just switch to cooking or fishing.\r\n\r\nThe developers are also doing a good job with updates, and it’s nice to see the game grow.\r\n\r\nThere are still some bugs, and a few of them are serious, but the developers are working to fix them regularly. My biggest issue is the lag, which I get both on PC and Switch. Also, using a gamepad feels awkward.\r\n\r\nI’d love to see more locations added. Right now, we only have Kilima and Bahari Bay. Underwater areas or weather changes would be great. I also miss having seasons. During the 2023 Christmas event, the snow looked odd next to all the greenery and butterflies.",
      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-13)](https://steam/76561198084917653)\nthis game is so bad in a technical state, the tutorials are obnoxious, some people on all chat actually feel like an ai model (coming from someone that makes a living interacting with AI models), and the game feels so unpolished and clunky",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-29)](https://steam/76561198827593665)\nOkay. I am writing this review with only about 4-5 days of me playing this game. You be the judge if I like this game or not.\n\nFor being a Beta game it surely has a lot and is fun. Already got me spending money to buy some clothes. But overall this game is very fun. Similar to Stardew Valley but it's coop and has of course it's own features to it. There's a learning curve to this game and it gives you a vague description or tutorial on how to do things, so I get why it's overwhelming to many. Google will be your best friend with this game. The community is VERY FRIENDLY. Everyone is so nice. There's some unspoken Palia Ethics already which I love. \n\nOverall, just needs some more tutorials for beginners and some items. I do hope they publish a \"Trade with Other Player\" feature and some Farm Animals and possibly a Mount you can ride, since it's a bit difficulty to get to one place to another.",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-28)](https://steam/76561198124741888)\nFor a free game that's in beta still, you can see by the play hours of the positive reviews this game already offers a lot, and I had a really good time with it!\n\nHere I'll go through what I was looking for before playing, the pros and cons and then offer some tips at the bottom. \n\nBasically:\n+ lovely peaceful game\n+ lots to do\n+ not greedy devs, cosmetics only\n- very buggy\n- story and design still in beta\n\nHow free is it? \nIt's just cosmetics; there's no way to pay to be better or faster. When you log in the first time, there's a message from Singularity 6 which basically says \"if you like our game please tell people about it\" which I thought was really nice, I never felt pressured to spend, I bought a couple of cosmetics to support them for giving me 100 hours of enjoyment.\n\nWhat is the gameplay?\n\nVery casual and easy-going, it's based around building your home and the core skills which you level up; bug catching, cooking, fishing, foraging, furniture crafting, gardening, hunting and mining. As you level up you unlock more things you can craft for each skill and these skills are how you interact with the story, complete objectives and challenges.\n\nThe villagers work the same way; you level up your relationship with them to unlock cool things and more quests, they also provide the structure; context to the quests and objectives you'll be completing. A small part of this is the main story line, which is pretty interesting so far, but I'd say like 10% complete at the moment. There are other stories of different villagers which are complete to varying degrees, since the game is in beta. I'll say the few cutscenes that are finished are really nice.\n\nThis happens across two maps Kilima (medium sized) and Bahari (large sized), and there's a lot of running around, but there's no fall damage and nothing can hurt you. There is fast travel, but the game does not point it out (I'll get to that). \n\nEverything important to the game tends to work well and is fun! It didn't lag at all or crash hardly at all. I was able to do most of everything required in the game without big issues.\n\nNow, there are some negatives to consider; being a beta this game has many, many smaller bugs!\n\nIn my time almost everything you can think of had some sort of glitch (maps, menus, chat, gameplay, etc); there's a lot so here are some examples of the prominent common issues I had, as experienced played with a controller:\n\n1. Menus can be jank, it gets stuck and you have to switch to the next tab and then back to fix it. Sometimes also you press a button to do one thing and it does something else which uses the same button. \n\n2. The map can be jank, you select one villager to track and it keeps selecting somebody else far away.\n\n3. Also, from the map you can press a button to teleport home; this button is the same as the run button, but sometimes after closing the map menu, the game thinks it's open when it's not, so when you return to game and go to run you teleport home when you don't want to; since the areas are large and you have to wait before you can use the home teleport again, this bug was by far the most annoying!\n\n4. You have a wheel to select the tool you want, sometimes it selects the same tool over and over again and you miss out on a rare insect or hunting opportunity because you can't put your fishing rod away in time.\n\n5. Visually, EVERYBODY, every NPC and player, bug out; they're gliding across the floor, standing in the ground, floating above the ground, walking in place, walking through walls, appearing to fall, some players even get stuck under the inn. You can buy a cosmetic pet that runs around with you, but I couldn't use it because it was constantly bugging out and distracting me; dropping from the sky in front of me or flipping out, and other player's physics items are always stretching and glitching out. Mostly this happens when you first get there and from a distance, but not always. It did not affect the gameplay but it's absolutely something you'll notice, even if you do get used to it quickly.\n\n6. A few NPC positions can make it hard to interact with them or around them, like Hassian stands on the same exact spot as his dog Tau, and Shiffa blocks access to her own anvil, so you have to jump around to find the specific spot needed.\n\n7. I had a constant bug where my character would keep turning 180 degrees when still to face the camera; I HATE this bug, especially when you're around other players, lol.\n\nThere are design issues too: \n\n1. Lack of tutorials for important or basic things, or tutorials appearing far after you need them when you're first starting. I had to look up basic things on my phone because simple, obvious things like dragging and dropping would not work.\n\n2. You can't sell furniture you make, even for the price of the materials or for 1 gold just to get rid of them; you have to store or destroy furniture.\n\n3. NPCs sometimes ask for outrageously rare items for little to no reason.\n\n4. If you don't enjoy one of the skills it can take a long time to reach the level up needed (like I don't enjoy cooking). A few quests require items only obtainable by progressing far in one of these skills, but there should always be another way to get these items, even if it's tricky, otherwise you're forcing players to grind something they don't enjoy. This was rare but still an issue.\n\n5. Lastly, I'd say some of the quests require a lot of work and have a little or no pay off (Jina's picnic, Tish's dance) I again assume due to being beta. Some quests are very anticlimactic and end with no real consequence.\n\nOverall:\n\nEven despite all of that jank I had a great time with this game. This main gameplay of using your skills to help NPCs and unlock things as you play was peaceful and mostly fun and rewarding, you can decorate your property quite impressively, and throughout the game it's fun discovering what you can unlock you had no idea about. \n\nThere's a review saying this game is not for introverts but I really have to disagree, I think there's one quest that might need interaction (fulfil a player request). If you do want to talk the game is basically full of people who just want to chill and build a cool little house, so I found people really chill and helpful anyway. Totally recommend!\n\nTips!\n\n1. Know what you have! \n\nThere's a lot of rare and epic items in the game, some which can take days to find if you're looking for them, which you might find by chance, so if you're just starting and you get an epic bug or fish that you don't know what to do with, keep it! (as you might want it later for something to do with a door and night sky temple) and if you see a weird bug try and get it!\n\n2. I would NOT gift any NPC a rare or epic item unless it's for a quest objective, it's not worth it! Also one specific bug, Duskwing Butterflies, are listed as \"uncommon\" but they're technically like epics in rarity.\n\n3. Cooking uses items from your inventory first, then from your storage, so make sure you have enough stuff to protect the things you want to keep! You can buy a locked chest from Tish's shop to keep things safe.\n\n4. For fishing, if you're trying to catch a certain fish (especially rare or epic fish), it will show you the fish before you reel it in to see if you need it or not so if you don't want it, don't reel it in! \nOnce the fish has gone back down, then reel in, as this will reset the fish and you'll keep the bait; really important for glow worms which are hard to get, but keep an eye on the condition of the rod!\n\n5. The Palia wiki is really useful for finding things.\n\n6. You'll eventually get to glowy (flow) trees, people meet up to chop these at the same time. If you hit each glowing tree once with your axe you get the same loot as everyone else who hits it, even if you don't chop it down! It's kind to let people know the location (you'll see this in chat a lot).\n\n7. You can date all the villagers with no consequence, they don't care, lol.\n\nHave fun!",

Toss in a premium store for real money, and I'd much rather pay for an actual game with a bit more depth to it.\n\nPerhaps down the line they'll add more complexity, but considering that this is an online co-op game, I doubt it.\n\nYour mileage with it may vary if you like online co-op or have younger kids.  However, I'll note that I noticed several inconsistencies with the UI not showing me the location of certain quest givers or other objectives.  I'm an old school gamer, so this didn't bother me much, but younger players may find it frustrating.\n\nTo summarize - for me this is a pass, but it is free, so give it a try.",

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-28)](https://steam/76561198314749783)\nI'm somewhat picky about what games I play, but holy cow Palia did not disappoint. It instantly sucked me in. It's like if an MMO didn't infuriate you and it was just the good stuff. There's no combat so no worrying about dying to something that will just tick you off. I'll go into more specifics below.\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS/NPCs:\r\nThe characters in the village all have their own unique personalities that are easy to remember and you'll definitely come to have your own favorites and...less favorites. You can also initiate a romance with certain characters, something that's really cool and that I wish was incorporated into more games. The dialogue is really well-written and can change based on different factors of your character, something that really adds to the experience. You get different unique quests from the characters when you reach certain friendship goals with them, something that keeps you engaged and constantly keeps you busy with quests.\r\n\r\nQUESTS/RIDDLES:\r\nNormally, riddles infuriate me in games since I am not particularly puzzle inclined. Luckily, most of the riddles in Palia are super easy to solve. I don't have to look things up very often, which is a complaint I have a lot about other games that I've played. There are also a lot of quests which keep you quite busy so that you always have something to do, but not in an overwhelming way.\r\n\r\nSKILLS:\r\nYour character has multiple different skills (Gardening, Farming, Mining, etc.) that you can level up and get a reward when you reach the lv. 10 milestone of a particular skill. It can be a bit of a grind. It's not frustrating, but it can be time-consuming so it just depends on your preference for grinding skills to raise them.\r\n\r\nSHOP/MICROTRANSACTIONS:\r\nSince Palia is free to play, it makes sense to include some content that is paid for with real currency. As of right now, it's only cosmetic aspects (fancy clothes, tool skins, pets, gliders, etc.) that cost money. It doesn't impact that game at all, entirely the player's own preference and even if you don't want to pay for the cooler looking clothes, there are different free options for your character's outfit.",

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-23)](https://steam/76561198124217611)\nHonestly, yes. I was hyped about this game when it first came out, and I may of been expecting a little too much for a game that just had entered closed beta. Then when open beta came, I found myself distracted by a thousand other titles instead.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER. This game has drawn me back to it a few times for my curiosity of it's charm. It has quest lines, crafting of many sorts, farming/grinding material, gold farming, and 8 skills to level; Including cooking, logging, gardening (farming), furniture making (building/decor), mining, bug catching, hunting, and of course everyone's favorite in a game, fishing. Plus, there's building up your own plot with intricate decorating and a lovely building system for it, itches that \"Sims\" game feel. The game also now has a cute minigame called hotpot that everyone wins at technically and can get you prizes, as well as parkour course. My point being, the devs ARE adding things since I first played, and that's what keeps me coming back.\r\n\r\nMy only gripe with the game, and it may be yours too, is that the map is lacking in expansion a bit. If you're someone who loves exploration, you'll enjoy the map for the first 10 hours, but after that, you kinda know where everything is easily enough. I suggest doing the quests to do more exploring and navigational puzzles.\r\n\r\nOverall, a solid 7/10 experience for the average cozy gamer who likes a healthy community and grinding game w/ somewhat MMO experience to it.",

      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-21)](https://steam/76561197973193893)\nThis could be a great game, but it's an absolute bugfest. Should be fine solo, but co-op gets ruined by so many related bugs.\n\n- Party members load invisible quite a lot so all you see is a floating name. This lasts until the next loading screen, so you can't see what they do, struggle finding them and can't coordinate properly.\n- Party sometimes breaks in a sense that one person sees the party, but the other doesn't (no party member UI, no compass visibility, friend list says you can invite people that are actually in your party, the button does nothing). This requires a restart.\n- Party member names are sometimes green, sometimes white. Sometimes you see them on the compass, other times you don't.\n- Quests sometimes only show for 1 person on the compass, but if you are next to the NPC, you will see it on top of their head.\n- Quests sometimes only genuinely appear for 1 person in the party, even though you've done everything together from the start. This causes a desync in progression.\n- Party members often show half in the floor (NPCs too), or way underground. I've even seen them run around in the basement of a building when they never even entered it.\n- Fishing rods of other players sometimes appear invisible.\n- Hunting deer is a challenge when the deer spaz and teleport around.\n- Tutorial popups are bugged in an annoying way. I keep seeing the same ones I've seen before reappearing, even had it happen twice 5 seconds apart. There is an option to disable tutorials, but that way you also won't learn anything new you haven't seen before, so it's either getting spammed by useless popups or never learning what you should. Also had a tutorial overal a developer note, which froze all my controls as I couldn't click the button behind the tutorial popup and had to restart.\n\nThese are not hardware/network issues. These are game issues. I am enjoying the gameplay as such, but these issues are frustrating.",

When I heard this, I was intrigued but for some reason never gave it a shot. I always just assumed it had some really poor Pay to Win features that I didn't want to find out about but boy was I wrong.\r\n\r\nIf you love Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing and really any sort of Farming Life Game, then by all means give Palia a shot. You have a lot of things to do. You can Farm Crops, Cook Foods, Smelt down Ores, Craft Furniture, Become friends with people which leads to romancing them. There are a bunch of quests you can do for rewards. You gain a lot of tools early on which allow you to Chop, Mine, Fish, Catch Bugs, Farm and so much more. You get your own Plot of land where you can build a house and really just customise your own home however you want.\r\n\r\nJust a very fun pass the time sort of game.

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-11)](https://steam/76561198089202896)\nIf Stardew Valley and Dreamlight Valley had a spicy love affair, you get Palia. For a free game, you get more than what you pay for. The overall wholesomeness of the game makes it easy to get into. The community is extremely helpful and friends can be made all over. \n\nMuch like the polyamorous relationships with the pretty purple elves; the game actively encourages teamwork and bringing friends along on your errands. There are benefits to working with others and you are able to choose your own pace for the game. \n\nThe game uses real time for progression. Farming and refining materials are done over time. This makes it easy to play casually. Crafting and decorating are straightforward, but cooking has the most interesting mechanics. Preparing meals and putting them together brings an odd sense of satisfaction to my brain.\n\nThere's no combat other than hunting passive creatures, but I suspect something more substantial will be introduced beyond beta.\n\nWhy is it free? Cosmetics. That's all. Supporting the devs is a small price to pay for looking pretty and you're given a large variety of wardrobe items to work with for free anyway and you can change your appearance quite often for no fees. I pray this does not age like milk.\n\nThe greatest feature Palia has to offer is Hotpot. A deceptively addictive card game that's easy to play and easy to love. Even if you don't win a full deck, you still earn rewards. The Tower is also a fun jumping puzzle game if that's up your alley to pass the time.\n\nPalia is a great game to invest in if you're looking for a good time sink.\n\nAlso the Bluebristle Muujin can go to hell.",

Even more fun and addictive with your gf/bf, friends or really, just people around are generally really kind. It's a blast to for example go mining alone, encounter a random player who's hunting and join them on the fly. There's a lot of emphasis on freedom and grouping up with other people, while still being fun playing alone.\r\n\r\nI know it's a free game, but I'd love to see *some* options to get a premium currency slowly. The customization is there, but compared to the rest of the content it's severely lacking unless you pay real life cash.\r\n\r\nIt's everything buy pay to win, though. No P2W, no timewalls, no ads, just a solid game to play for hours on end without any pressure.\r\nIt's great to have a movie/audiobook while having Palia on the side as well",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-10)](https://steam/76561198217254399)\nI have a hard time sticking with games like this but this has got me hooked. I love the community and I love the  mechanics of the game. The game is new so sometimes it does crash but it's only happened to me once so far. You can progress without spending real currency. The only paid items are clothing tool skins and pets. All purely cosmetic. The story line is fun and there is so much to do. The characters have amazing personality and the quests are never ending. If you want a game like Stardew or Harvest moon without all the stress this game is for you.",

I won't lie, I'm slightly addicted to it now.\n\nThis game is in beta and already has so much content. The game is jittery, and could do with tweaking a bit in some places, but the developers have done an amazing job already.\nThe game has fishing, farming, foraging, mining, furniture making and cooking. It has friendships and relationships, and numerous quests.\nI personally think more NPCs would be a great addition. Also more farming plots and things to grow. Also more things to hunt. But again this is still a beta game. I have clocked up over 300 hours. They have regular updates, they don't always fix the stuff that needs it, but they always add stuff. Plushies are a major hype in this game. You will find out when you download it.\nIf you're looking for a nice chilled game, then definitely download it, you have nothing to lose while it's free.",

I havent really felt anything is too repetive or anything so far and the public chat / community seems very nice! I think the size of the map is really cool and makes the idea of exploring seem fruitful with the variety of forage types. Also the fact that some villagers live in different sections of the 2 maps makes you have a reason to go between.

I like the music and the atmosphere and the visuals of the game. The decorating aspect of the game is phenomenal, there are so much customization options and super cute pieces to work with. \nSome thing I'm hoping to see in the future would be the ability to have a horse or some kind of means of transport other than running, gliding, or the fast travel option. \nI also wish there was a bit more direction with some of the bigger story-line quests but this isn't a deal breaker issue.",

But this game works and runs much more seamlessly on PC. The graphics are of course better as well. In general this game is a really fun cozy game and grinding for materials doesn't feel too annoying. I like how it seems to take inspiration from fun activities among a whole bunch of different games in this genre. Only ran into a couple of small bugs that got fixed very quick and never made the game unplayable. I do also like that it's not \"pay to win\" and as far as purchasing things goes it's purely cosmetic things. I thoroughly enjoy the story and game concept and it's very rewarding to play with friends with all the extra perks of teamwork. Very clean game design and the sound effects and voice lines are wonderful and very relaxing. <3 I'd say it's a solid 9.5/10 I love this game and cannot wait for the full release. :3 Would also love more animal/creature themed outfits!",

That's not always a bad thing, since whatever waylaid you, you needed anyways or was better than what you were first doing.

It's kinda got this Disney Dreamlight Valley/Stardew thing going on so you go into town a lot getting to know the same cast of characters developing your relationship tier with them, getting rewards from them etc. \n\nThe home and garden area is a big part of this game as you can visit peoples homes if they are set to public. You expand your land, unlock tons of stuff, craft, decorate. You can even put down the gold tier fish you catch as fish tanks to show off what you've caught. Pretty neat.\n\nLike a lot of survival/gathering you need the nice pick for the big rocks, the nice axe for the big trees etc etc so there is some grind but it's all very casual.\n\nEach in game night starting 6pm until morning, players gather at this casino type area underneath the general goods store and play cards. A foodie go fish style game that rewards you with coins to spin at a wheel of fortune. The tables fill up fast which makes it pretty exciting to get a spot and have fun with the community.\n\nAnother neat community feature is the item request system. You can request a limited number of just about any items. You can help other people get items they need or request something you might need in a pinch.\n\nI had a few bugs mainly dialogue/menu related where I had to restart the game, but the stakes are so low in this game a restart is no biggie and nothing was perma bugged.\n\nOverall hard recommend.

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-01)](https://steam/76561199017133162)\nAfter playing this game for roughly 110 hours, I can safely say it's worth the time. I spent about 80 of said hours completing the main story line, but I imagine people who did not venture into the sidequests, relationship and friendship quests could complete the main story line (which finished for me when I completed \"Find your Shepp,\" as it was the last thing I did in the main quest line) in a shorter time period. I am still not finished at 110 hours with friendship quests (have not maxed out any friendships yet) or relationship quests (have only completed 1 at this time). I have only just now reached Level 10 of two of the eight core skills you're expected to develop, and this is considered a Bronze Level while Level 50 of the skill is considered a Gold Level. I have not yet collected all bugs, or fish of Palia. I have not yet built all variations/collections of furniture. I clearly still have many, many hours of game-play left of Palia to complete. You do not need to spend \"real money\" in order to enjoy this game, this game completely functions without the premium cosmetics. But if you're like me, and you have such an enjoyable and incredible experience playing, buying some \"Palia coins\" to spend on cosmetics seems fitting to show your support for the game. My in-game experience with other players has been overall positive. People are helpful, informative, and generally kind. There are one-off experiences where people have strange behavior, but it's the internet. I caught on to in-game lingo quickly, scoured Internet resources and tools to learn a few quirky things about the game; but overall, I have been able to figure out how to play the game on my own or with the in-game guides/tutorials. There's been very little I've had to research on how to do because there wasn't enough instruction, really just driven by my own impatience and desire to complete collections. There's a lot about this game I still don't know about, even 110 hours into it. The seasoned players I read online and especially coming into this game during a new feature called \"Home Tours,\" WOW -- I had no idea how serious some Palia players have been the last 11 months of this game. You will see some people complaining about how there isn't enough to do or how there aren't enough updates or how the developers aren't pushing out enough content; but truthfully, a game that takes 80 hours to complete for a normal person is pretty impressive content. A game that allows you to sink an additional 50+ hours into for just fun and skill building and side-quest completion is even more impressive. People who are criticizing a lack of \"stuff to do\" have just been over-saturating themselves with it and playing too long. Trust me..... there's so much to do..... so many bugs to catch, so many things to build, so many crops to grow, so many jams to make, so many fish to lure... so many, so many, so many things to do.",

      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-05)](https://steam/76561198191542663)\nDidn't like it. You might, I just don't.\n\nI had a lot of trouble getting the game to work. I had to go into my steam audio settings and ensure everything was set specifically to my headphones and mic(which most games just do on their own) or else the game would not load at all... then I had issues where my escape button stopped working and I had to force exit. After that, the game worked, but there's tons of audio stuttering... but, to be fair- my computer is an older one. However, I run Genshin at 60fps most of the time with no audio issues at all.\n\nI find the character designs to be a mixed bag. The player characters are serviceable- I was able to make one of my favorite OCs, but the hairstyle selection was still somewhat limited in terms of longer hair.\n\nThe NPCs are... very jarring? They're very cringe and cutesy, a bit, which... can be fine but they force you through tutorial after tutorial and it gets old really fast... there's lots of tutorial menus appearing on other tutorial menus and it just... does not stop for the first 30 to 40 minutes.\n\nI don't care for the character designs of the NPCs overall. They are just purple people with pointy ears, nothing else to them. That CAN work, but in this case it just feels random and strange... I don't feel immersed at all. There are lots of ways purple or blue elves could work; make their character designs super interesting, but they are all just random human-like people.\n\nThen there's the gameplay. Hunting and fishing are alright. Anything else... zzzzzzzzz. Very boring. The UI feels very unfinished, which for a game that's been out for a year... that's unacceptable.\n\nClimbing is buggy and messy. You'll often clip into things. There's not a lot of people, those that are there don't really talk much. Except the NPCs. They don't shut up :)",

So they want the company to put more effort into the cash shop than the game. Welcome to the realities of the F2P model.\n\nThese same criticisms were made of Fortnite when it launched.  It's gone on to do just fine, and had continued to have a cash shop of cosmetics that don't affect gameplay.

The problem with Palia lies with priorities. Many systems are unrealized and unpolished compared to other games like it (from much smaller studios) yet the cash shop is already up an functioning. It also begs the question, what are their motivations for doing things the way they do them? Is making the game online in itself done just to sell more cosmetics? Are they going to forgo a more interactive pet system in lieu of one where they can sell cosmetic only pets?  \n\n \\- In a game with such few systems cosmetics play a much larger role in motivating a player. The fact that it's open beta only makes the emphasis on MTX items that much more glaring of a problem (because there's basically nothing to work for at some point).\n\n#### Comment ID jwgi277 with +7 score by [(hyrle, Reddit, 2023-08-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwgi277/) (in reply to ID jwg9fhv):\nWhen Fortnite was in beta, it wasn't a finalized product, though.  It had far fewer features than it has now.  It didn't have several of the systems it has now.  It had far fewer game modes.  In fact, it spent years in beta.\n\nI get the concerns over lack of content in Palia.  I even get concerns about cosmetics costing more than people want to pay (let's face it... any price over $0 is going to be more than some people want to pay.)  But it must be remembered this is a recently-opened live service game that's in beta and shouldn't be critiqued as if it's a complete game.  Even the fully-launched Fortnite continues to evolve, and I'm certain Palia will as long as it is profitable enough to keep it going.    And if it's not profitable, then like hundreds of live service games before it, then it'll close shop as so many F2P games have done before.\n\nIt's understandable that some might not like the direction of that evolution - and it's fair to critique that - but I'm just saying the expectations for a beta should be far lower.\n\n### Comment ID jwgxycg with +2 score by [(MeVe90, Reddit, 2023-08-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwgxycg/) (in reply to ID jwg4lqm):\nI'm surprised they didn't launch a battle pass yet\n\n## Comment ID jwik56a with +5 score by [(Eggsysmistress, Reddit, 2023-08-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwik56a/) (in reply to ID 15ss9gg):\ni thought they were an indie studio at first and was like “aww what a cute game. i’m sure they’ll work hard to make it better”. \n\npfft.\n\n## Comment ID jwjkx17 with +4 score by [(magvadis, Reddit, 2023-08-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwjkx17/) (in reply to ID 15ss9gg):\nIndie has to due with being owned by a major game company. \n\nOne 50 million dollar game does not make you major...at all.\n\n### Comment ID jwjlwc7 with +2 score by [(PsyTripper, Reddit, 2023-08-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwjlwc7/) (in reply to ID jwjkx17):\nThanks for clearing that up.

And they also have their own platforms.\n\nA better example to illutrate your point would have been CDProjekt Red.\n\nI guess my point would be that there are big indie studios, and small indie studios, both as independant as can be, but with wildly varying resources. Singularity 6 is a big indie studio. But still indie nonetheless.\n\n## Comment ID jwhxn1d with +3 score by [(Ezone35482, Reddit, 2023-08-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwhxn1d/) (in reply to ID 15ss9gg):\nI’m enjoying the game. lol.

I haven't been able to find a solid answer to this so if anyone has a source I'm genuinely curious.

Taking away that feature would’ve lost them a ton of players as deeds(the activity that earns the store currency) are a very popular thing for many veteran players to work on once they’ve completed the current end game raids and dungeons. Essentially, the MMO saying “the true end game is fashion” is very much based in reality for LOTRO. The feature has basically been grandfathered in throughout the various acquisitions LOTRO has gone through over the years. (source: I’ve been playing LOTRO off and on for over a decade)\n\nPalia, however, is still very new and, as a result, very malleable. I’m trying to remain optimistic, but I won’t be surprised if this acquisition means big changes for Palia and its monetization. Ultimately, though, if it means the game will make it to 1.0 while retaining its heart and soul, I’ll be ecstatic. The S6 devs have created a really solid foundation and I’d love to see what else they have planned.\n\n#### Comment ID lb87gk4 with +15 score by [(AmberRosalie_, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb87gk4/) (in reply to ID lb84smp):\nThey only publish LoTRO though so I’m not sure how much actual involvement they have.

So I had not to spend anything there.\n\nAnd the fee to purchase the Add-ons was really low compared to the original price in points.\n\nIf i remember it correctly, they had giveaway free, 26 Quest packs from different zones, and offer each expansion pack from Moria to Mordor for each 100 points only, while the mordor pack had cost 2500 points.\n\nSure, without that event it had taken more time to get it free, but could still be possible. But I was able to spend my remaining points for different stuff.\n\n### Comment ID lb7ta5c with +9 score by [(Emmyisawesome128, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb7ta5c/) (in reply to ID lb7q8ec):\nWhat's that game?

I have seen some games under the Daybreak banner flourish and others fail.\n\nIn the official statement released it does say that S6 and the game development will still stay under the current leadership.  This  lends hope that maybe Palia will have some luck similar to LotRO where Daybreak is more of a \"publisher\" than a developer.  \n\nWill we see more monetization?  Of course.  A game has to have a revenue stream somehow to continue support and development.  This would have been coming regardless of the Daybreak acquisition or not.  And if they didn't, then our favorite world would eventually die out.\n\nAll we can do at this point is just wait and see.  Me personally, I'll continue to play just how I've been playing and watch what changes.  If it starts to change for the better, GREAT!  If it starts to go downhill, then I'll just start looking for a new home.\n\n## Comment ID lb9zaxp with +9 score by [(mistar_z, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb9zaxp/) (in reply to ID 1dt7ujt):\nI'm concerned for the employees. I knew that when they did all those big layoffs earlier this year it meant that they're probably planning for a sale or acquisition, to look better on paper . This sadly isn't great news for the remaining employees as acquisitions normally means more layoffs on the horizon as the leadership restructures the company to their new bottom line.\n\n\nBut on the positive side.

There’s always more layoffs on the horizon. They change the company culture. Just experienced an acquisition myself and so many people are quitting bc after layoffs we’re a skeleton crew and they turned the culture so profit driven.\n\nIf anyone thinks the ethics of Palia are going to stay the same- don’t hold your breath. I wouldn’t be surprised if they stayed pushing ads for in game purchases and went in a different direction with art eventually. \n\nWe can’t forget that S6 is a for-profit company. And this acquisition is going to open peoples eyes to that. It’s no shade on S6.

It's purely cosmetic, it doesn't give any boost, so why are people so outraged? Because developers who are working so hard on a F2P HUGE MMO (for an indie dev) dare ask for money? Servers cost money. Work costs money. People who say they're gonna stop playing because they can't have a free cosmetic sound really entitled to me tbh the only thing they put behind paywall is cosmetic, which makes sense, since they need money to keep the game up. \"Playing our game isn't good enough\" as if we're doing them a favour by playing a game they're pouring so much work in.\n\n## Comment ID lb7r951 with +35 score by [(theaveragepyrenees, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb7r951/) (in reply to ID 1dt7ujt):\nI’ll be so sad if this game gets ruined and turns into a p2w 😭 \n\nI wouldn’t mind paying for some things, because I do like the game, but if it becomes impossible to play without tons of micro transactions I’m gonna have to delete it and start ACNH over or something.\n\n### Comment ID lb7s94j with +25 score by [(scoliid, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb7s94j/) (in reply to ID lb7r951):\nThe only reason i am carefully optimistic about this is that Palia doesn't exactly have \"winning\" or \"losing\".

If they were making plenty off of people buying the clothing and just wanting to support the company, there wouldn’t have been layoffs. It sucks, but there’s a reason MMOs don’t follow this monetization model, and it’s not JUST corporate greed.

Daybreak, formerly known as Sony Online Entertainment, launched EverQuest in 1999 and the game is still going.

First, they were part of SISA with which they started developement of EverQuest. Then SOE was made and SISA was renamed into 989 Studios. THEN they went into making PS games, while a branch spun off and formed RedEye Interactive which was then renamed as Verant Interactive.\n\nThen they released EverQuest. Later they were controlled by Sony Pictures which iirc was like, it's grandparent company (Sony Pictures owned SOE which owned Verant), and later in 2015 SOE was sold off to Columbus Nova and Verant changed it's name into Daybreak.\n\nWhich they claim no, they didn't, they were bought by Inception Acquisitions... which was related to Columbus Nova. Which was involved with the Renova Group. Which was... in trouble, to say the least, during 2016. Oh, those russians!\n\nThen in 2018 a mobile game company \"strategically\" invested in Daybreak to port games to mobile... and three rounds of layoffs occurred. Things went awry, it got separated into three teams and then in 2020 they were bought by Enad Global 7. \n\nThey also took over MTG Online in 2022, and it seems they had few layoffs since, with a recent one being of \"less than 15 employees\" from their three branches.\n\nAll that said, S6 may be lucky and have no issues now that Daybreak's situation has changed.\n\n### Comment ID lb9kexf with +4 score by [(h39000, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb9kexf/) (in reply to ID lb8sw64):\nI never had issues w the WoW sub because the game *worked*.

My old long time gamer husband tells me this isnt a bad thing at all. I trust his judgement on this because all I am seeing is folks getting their underwear twisted over how the company choose to fund the work on the game. Frankly we are lucky to have had a free game which hasnt had anything but skins behind a paywall. So how about a bit of positivity and hope instead? S6 have as far as I can tell in the 4 months of playing, given players practically everything they could do within the game mechanics as it stands.  Wanted plushies? you got them.. wanted trees? got them, wanted flow trees on your plot? you got them! Wanted hotpot back? we got it! Bigger houses? got that too....! S6 have listened and delivered where they can. So enough whining and moaning about their partnership with an established game provider, they can rehire, and hopefully we will see the fruits of this soon! If you dont want to buy into stuff then dont but if you are going to moan about a FREE to play game that is still currently in dev mode then you really need to find something else to do with your life.   \nPersonally I think this is rather exciting for S6, it shows confidence from the industry that Palia is viable for the future.\n\n### Comment ID lbbgeoy with +4 score by [(marchviolet, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lbbgeoy/) (in reply to ID lbasarc):\nMy own longtime gamer husband also had a relatively positive reaction to this news when I shared it with him.

They are pretty much the exact opposite of what S6 was about when it comes to monetization. The fact S6 was even open to an acquisition in the first place isn't a good sign but if you couple that with them actually going through with it with such a publisher speaks volumes. This one line from the official acquisition statement says it all.\n\n\"It is incredibly exciting to find like-minded partners who share in our commitment to investing in our products and players for the long-term\"\n\nLet's focus on this a little, \"products\" and \"players\". First off, S6 would never refer to the game as a \"product\", so right from the start you know this section wasn't written by them. Secondly, any time a company mentions 2 things under the same context you should always read them separately like this.\n\n\"It is incredibly exciting to find like-minded partners who share in our commitment to investing in our products\"\n\n\"It is incredibly exciting to find like-minded partners who share in our commitment to investing in our players for the long-term\"\n\nRead that last one about players and what does it sound like to you? I'll spell it out for you just in case...we are the product, not the game. They have invested in a new player base that is outside there normal target audience. Whether this is good or bad will remain to be seen but they have an expectation of a return on that investment and with a game like Palia that could be tricky. It costs more to create something new then it does to place artificial limitations on us and people are far more likely to spend money on a better experience then on a prettier one. So like I originally said, hope for the best but prepare for the worst because the odds are not in our favor here by a long shot and it really pains me because I love this game.\n\nEDIT: Somehow the other half of my comment got cut when I posted lol. So here is my optimistic side.\n\nThis DOES have a bright side to it. Investment from a bigger company can be a really good thing. Most of the games under Daydreams publishing are actually good games if you ignore the monetization factor. The world building and lore behind most of them are top notch, but the story writing tends to be a little lack luster. S6 however has great writing and a LOT of lore and world elements to build upon so with Daydreams backing Palia has a lot going for it in a good way.\n\n## Comment ID lb83d6r with +10 score by [(haffasandwitch, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb83d6r/) (in reply to ID 1dt7ujt):\n![gif](giphy|7doqMMIYTH1Zkq9mpY|downsized)\n\n## Comment ID lbbmyo0 with +6 score by [(TwistedReads, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lbbmyo0/) (in reply to ID 1dt7ujt):\nwell. good run everyone see you in the next game!\n\n## Comment ID lbdyjsa with +6 score by [(evaperated, Reddit, 2024-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lbdyjsa/) (in reply to ID 1dt7ujt):\nHonestly I’m a huge fan of the battle pass model, and would welcome something like that in Palia.  They are usually affordable (don’t tell me y’all don’t spend more a month at Starbucks for something you drink in five seconds and toss) and offer fun items and things to look forward to.\n\nEveryone wants everything free.  They either complain that a one time fee for a game is ‘ridiculously overpriced’ or they complain a completely free to play game DARES to have a cash shop feature.\n\nI’ve bought outfits I like in Palia, and bought the landscapes and a couple pets.  I’d rather spend money on that than something like fast food or overpriced coffee.\n\nI’m excited for what this does for Palia and hope it’s for the best!\n\n## Comment ID lb7s5v8 with +12 score by [(aka_quinn, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb7s5v8/) (in reply to ID 1dt7ujt):\nCool, a company that has bad success with games...\n\n## Comment ID lb7ydp9 with +6 score by [(atomicxblue, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb7ydp9/) (in reply to ID 1dt7ujt):\nDaybreak has made some good decisions with LOTRO by adding expansions, but they do love a good cash shop.\n\n## Comment ID lb8hvag with +5 score by [(SSGxMyNameRay, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb8hvag/) (in reply to ID 1dt7ujt):\nWell there goes the neighborhood.

It was basicaly Sci-Fi Warcraft, but it didn’t feel as “WoW clone” at all. The World Building was on point and it was all funny and jokes most of the time, but very serious when an important story archs happened. Just a perfect way how to tell a story imho.\n\nGameplay-wise it had everything what you wanted from an OG theme park mmorpg, but in a modern coat. Dungeons, raids, pvp bgs and arenas, ranked modes, awesome housing system, the list goes on. The best part? It released with all of that stuff. No “alpha” bullshit. Except for bugs and tuning, it just felt finished on the release day.\n\nMany people will disagree with me, but it was THE mmorpg for me. I played from start to shut-down and I wish I re-lived it again. My only real problems with the game was the simplified gearing system ( just 1 weapon per class ) and the telegraph spell system just wasn’t right in large scale battles ( most of the ground were just green and red circles and you couldn’t see anything in battlegrounds for example.)\n\n#### Comment ID lbb6bbq with +1 score by [(PersistentWorld, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbb6bbq/) (in reply to ID lbb1yz9):\nBest classes, housing combat and artstyle of any MMO ever\n\n\n\n#### Comment ID lbbi53k with +3 score by [(Concurrency_Bugs, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbbi53k/) (in reply to ID lbb1yz9):\nYou had player housing, and you could craft and place DUNGEONS on your plot of land.

Then you have Fireshine, the other Daybreak titles, Pirahna Games, etc.\n\nSo, as things stand, the company generates $30-40MM per year in EBITDA. Part of which they can redeploy into game development, publishing or acquisition. \n\nIf is a surprisingly resilient company.\n\n### Comment ID lbdemrc with +6 score by [(RedstrideTV, Reddit, 2024-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbdemrc/) (in reply to ID lbb2wlo):\nThey also have magic the gathering online\n\n### Comment ID lbeipg7 with +4 score by [(tsukaimeLoL, Reddit, 2024-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbeipg7/) (in reply to ID lbb2wlo):\nPalia was dying pretty steadily, all the devs getting fired, etc. so I can't imagine they paid more than a few million for the whole thing\n\n### Comment ID lbem1yc with +3 score by [(outbound_flight, Reddit, 2024-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbem1yc/) (in reply to ID lbb2wlo):\nI want to say that their stable of MMOs are basically all profitable. Especially something like EQ, which doesn't necessarily have the highest player count, but something like 80% of all players subscribe, which is an incredible conversion rate for any game.\n\nThey also have stuff like DCUO, LOTRO (at a time when there's a lot of LotR media coming out) and DDO (at a time when D&D is really popular).\n\nPlus, like MassivelyOP pointed out once, all Daybreak games have essentially paid off their initial development costs and are running with super small teams. A dev for LOTRO has said that he's doing stuff solo that used to require six devs in the Turbine days, thanks to more efficient tools and content pipelines.\n\nSo I think Daybreak in particular has just really turned all their companies into lean operations with solid profit margins.\n\n#### Comment ID lbf6cju with +1 score by [(Vanrax, Reddit, 2024-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbf6cju/) (in reply to ID lbem1yc):\nPretty much.

Pay for convenience, pay to win, etc., whatever you want to call it, it's coming.

But if Daybreak is as hands on as they usually are, this game is going to go one of two ways.\n\n  \n1. They stay mostly hands-off, allow S6 team to develop within healthy timeframes and put out content.\n\n2. They grab unto the game with such force and forcefeed it more in store items (P2w items, convience items, premium pass,etc.)\n\n  \nFor now? I can't say for sure, but I am biased in my examination of the situation as Daybreak has been horrible about alot of cashgrab things, not caring for titles, etc. Overall, I hope the S6 team does well enough to support their families and relatives.

For a life Sim it lacks basic features, the decorating is nice but you can hardly interact with anything. Especially in town. Benches you can't sit in at all, a tavern where you can't sit eat, drink, nothing. \n\nAnd for an mmo it's like 20 people in a town map, and your alone in your home instance. They could have done a neighborhood like xiv so you can at least see some other houses without having to ask to be invited. \n\nThere is a clothing shop but it only sells clothes for premium currency, all \"basic\" clothes are just unlocked from the start. The shop is basically purely cosmetic as well since you just buy it from the store, from anywhere. \n\nThe character creator is pretty barebones as well, for a fully social game with no other real content besides rp. Like two body types, 4 faces, and maybe 20 hairstyles. This should have had City of Heroes level of customization or more.\n\n### Comment ID ky83aom with +25 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-04-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1bwiuin/cozy_mmo_palia_developer_singularity_6_has/ky83aom/) (in reply to ID ky6tkrn):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID ky9fot3 with +15 score by [(LaurenMille, Reddit, 2024-04-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1bwiuin/cozy_mmo_palia_developer_singularity_6_has/ky9fot3/) (in reply to ID ky83aom):\nAre they still instantly banning anyone that offers constructive criticism? \n\nI was part of the exodus of players that happened when they went on their banning spree with anyone that wouldn't parrot exactly what they said.\n\n#### Comment ID kyauig7 with +9 score by [(SyleSpawn, Reddit, 2024-04-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1bwiuin/cozy_mmo_palia_developer_singularity_6_has/kyauig7/) (in reply to ID ky83aom):\nI've *played* the game since Alpha (I think 3 years ago), the core problem is that what was available in Alpha was *exactly* what was delivered in Beta 2 years later.

      "# Post ID 1f7dd3m: “IT’S STILL IN BETA” with +199 score by [(FamiliarRadio9275, Reddit, 2024-09-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1f7dd3m/its_still_in_beta/)\nI'm sure we have either \n\na) made comments under a rant post saying something along the lines of \"it's still in BETA\" \n\n\nB) seen people under post of a valid rant or even your post of that same comment as well.\n\n\nHere is the silver lining: \n\nWe are a supply and demand society, our goal as BETA testers is to play the game, see how we like it, provide feedback whether it's what we would like to see more of or what's bothering us or maybe the bugs that they need to work on, and share, discuss, and support a newly developed game. The devs want revenue and profit which is what most entrepreneurs want. Therefor our \"complaining\" is needed (to an extent)\n\n\nYes, most of us are aware we are still in BETA but have you ever thought of why some users might think we aren't? Here are some reasons why they might think otherwise:\n\n\n\n-It isn't really promoted as BETA, while most of us know by excessive digging or joining from the start, I can understand how new users may not understand that. \n\n-irl money purchases. While it's a free game many might not see it as a BETA game when you add monetary purchases. Obviously an optional free-to-play game is at your own leisure, I can just see how they see it. \n\n\n-lack of communication. the loading screen literally says it's a game not \"beta\" not \"early release\" just game. \"We are a game that hopes to provide blah blah blah for many years to come.\" (Idk the sentence verbatim) as well as patches release, more and more bugs pile up. To which I'm sure they are aware of the ones prior. They don't seem to fix issues before adding new issues. So as a player, with in each patch having new elements of aesthetics can pose as finished game updates versus beta ones. \n\n\nObviously the devs can't do 1000 things at once. And I'm not saying they have worked hard. But we are their critics for good measure. And as I have heard people say in comments before, \"if you want to play the finished game then wait\". Which is true to an extent but we are allowed to voice our opinions as an investor to their game on the rise!\n\n\nHappy Gaming!\n\n\n## Comment ID ll6xi62 with +314 score by [(naomiedwards, Reddit, 2024-09-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1f7dd3m/its_still_in_beta/ll6xi62/) (in reply to ID 1f7dd3m):\nI love Palia but I hate the \"toxic cozy\" vibes of the community.\n\n### Comment ID ll7149y with +112 score by [(slwwls, Reddit, 2024-09-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1f7dd3m/its_still_in_beta/ll7149y/) (in reply to ID ll6xi62):\nSome of this community is so insufferable\n\n### Comment ID ll6zrho with +39 score by [(Fabulous_Extreme_170, Reddit, 2024-09-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1f7dd3m/its_still_in_beta/ll6zrho/) (in reply to ID ll6xi62):\nI’d upvote this comment 1000 times if I could\n\n### Comment ID ll7ooln with +26 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-09-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1f7dd3m/its_still_in_beta/ll7ooln/) (in reply to ID ll6xi62):\nyeah most cozy game communities have this prob. it happened a lot with DDLV. people think that critiquing a game automatically means negativity when in reality, critique comes from a place of love & wanting to improve.\n\n### Comment ID ll862y2 with +24 score by [(Cubicleism, Reddit, 2024-09-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1f7dd3m/its_still_in_beta/ll862y2/) (in reply to ID ll6xi62):\nWhy did you steal my spot at hotpot 😡 /j\n\n#### Comment ID ll8htcr with +20 score by [(Agreeable_Finish9499, Reddit, 2024-09-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1f7dd3m/its_still_in_beta/ll8htcr/) (in reply to ID ll862y2):\nNot our fault people's characters are invisible.\n\n### Comment ID ll7pvaz with +11 score by [(Feeling-Beautiful138, Reddit, 2024-09-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1f7dd3m/its_still_in_beta/ll7pvaz/) (in reply to ID ll6xi62):\nThat's why I enjoy games like V-Rising where I don't necessarily HAVE to interact with other people or be in their same server and I can still play the game.

I've given up trying to argue this point. For all intents and purposes as a live service game it's been launched. It has regular updates yes, but it should do when officially launched too. The storyline will hopefully be added to indefinitely, there is no end point.  \n\nThis is now a well used tactic for Devs to release games full of bugs under the guise of beta, as people will accept it as we keep seeing. Once a game is available to everyone it should not be allowed beta label. Beta testing is when it's released to a small group to test and get feedback and at this point should be nearly finished. Not a half baked game that is released on numerous platforms and has more effort put into it's premium store than the actual game. At this point they are just trying to get as much cash for as little content as possible.\n\n### Comment ID ll9k5zj with +4 score by [(Karisa98, Reddit, 2024-09-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1f7dd3m/its_still_in_beta/ll9k5zj/) (in reply to ID ll9bmn1):\nThat is a very fair assessment.

It really felt like their actual investors wanted a return or were drying up so forced them to keep a release timeline they weren't ready for, especially around forcing the switch release to be in 2023 despite the stability issues they were dealing with and the resulting broken elements from the switch release\n\n\n\nPlease do give them [feedback and bug repots](https://support.palia.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (they need the numbers to help with prioritization and stories to help with reproducibility), but know that no one here can do anything about them.\n\n --  Screenshot from September 2, 2024 of the initial screen on starting up the Steam version of Palia on PC showing the Palia logo with a \"beta\" badge\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fbgnfyp00gmd1.png?width=1915&format=png&auto=webp&s=25ca31229be229b4beda00942c6aa1ad33082a37\n\n### Comment ID ll80lkx with +19 score by [(celosia89, Reddit, 2024-09-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1f7dd3m/its_still_in_beta/ll80lkx/) (in reply to ID ll6soen):\nand an analogous set of screenshots from Switch today as well - verified it was up to date 0.183 - _**without**_ the beta badge\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qlu3jwzp8hmd1.png?width=1277&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9345f62b1b4a665e6c9c2e966a50900cc54153e\n\n### Comment ID ll6u28f with +6 score by [(FamiliarRadio9275, Reddit, 2024-09-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1f7dd3m/its_still_in_beta/ll6u28f/) (in reply to ID ll6soen):\nHelpful but I did check my loading screen on switch as well as the switch store and it doesn’t say beta.

Yes there have been updates and improvements but nothing that i would solidly say has been worth the year wait. \n\nI fall out of fun with palia so often that i end up in the cycle of playing for the week an update drops and then not returning until another update drops. This isnt how you get solid player numbers, its not how you foster community. If im only interested in the game one week out of 12 there is a serious retention issue that needs addressing. \n\nIt is lacking in many areas, it also feels like the areas WE want addressing get ignored. The sheer reliance S6 have when it comes to player issues on the discord community is a little nuts imo. Never before have i seen the discord be used so heavily when it comes to customer care.It is F2P but the sheer amount of premium stuff is getting a bit ridiculous at this point\n\n## Comment ID ll88x02 with +19 score by [(No-Illustrator-9129, Reddit, 2024-09-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1f7dd3m/its_still_in_beta/ll88x02/) (in reply to ID 1f7dd3m):\nhttps://preview.redd.it/25s25p17khmd1.jpeg?width=558&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67ae1d04a9528d75eba7cef00cc355fa8cf4678a\n\n### Comment ID ll9xk09 with +15 score by [(ChaosMackenzie, Reddit, 2024-09-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1f7dd3m/its_still_in_beta/ll9xk09/) (in reply to ID ll88x02):\nI was going to comment the same thing.

It literally makes the game saddening in that aspect outside of that. I expect lags and bugs not only because it is still in development but because there are a lot of people that play this game now. Either way, I'd love more of the prices for real money to be more reasonable, I would spend 50 bucks or even 100 bucks to get more than 1 or 2 outfits at a time.

Whatever that means to you, to me it means playing as and with a group.\nPalia has virtually zero of that. We can argue there's some in hunting and cooking. But barely. Feels more like something that happened by accident rather than design. The new tree dweller for instance is a lot of fun as a group.\n\nStill on the social aspect... No actual common goals.\nNo specialization and no trading. A spouse that farms whatever all day has no proper way to help their significant other than to actually go farm with them again. Random gift limits \nSocial Friend requests that cant be cancelled and forever perpetuate your list.\nOne of the 3 souls that still plays with me can't connect since the previous patch.\n\nTickets that have zero personalization. Straight out of a script and a request to send logs. Even on trivial things.\n\nPatches. There are many game devs here. We know how it is. HOWEVER... You can't always excuse it. If you already have the framework and are reskining things, the whole setup shouldn't break. Adding quest dialogue when you already have a quest system shouldn't be a server breaking ordeal.\nIf you are struggling with seasonal content like every other game does... You need a better testing group.\nThere has yet to be a single patch that didn't devolve into overtime. Not one. Even quick hotfixes have done it sometimes.\nAlso, if you add a \"let me do this quest later\" option... How about testing to make sure it works? A game breaking issue from the new NPC I saw no mention of since it was identified.\nYet, the new cosmetics keep coming at increased prices.\nI have no issue on this topic, but on the subject of optics, you have game breaking bugs but you project an appearance of cosmetics having priority, which will inevitably turn some players away.\n\nAnd finally, on the subject of PC player retention...\nWhile we understand you're aiming for a Switch release and probably have technical limitations to consider...\nDecades now of observing mmo players should be a STRONG indication that be it the competitive, builder or gatherer player type, \"more\" is the goal.\nHaving limitations has given you an (hopefully) unintended \"game over\".\nGold limitations, renown limitations, storage limitations, building limitations, heck, even farming limitations, are only going to turn the non casual player away. If you want players online most of their free time, this is not a good approach.\n\nIn sum, I have capped my gold, crafted all the furniture, maxed storage, farming, all rep is maxed...\nIt is now a game I sometimes load once a week to do weekly medals and forget about it the rest of the week. And even this amounts to 5 minutes of \"hey, want to catch 10 bugs with me?\". \n\nAnd then we load a game that let's us play together for a common goal.\n\nTldr, please make your social game... Social.\n\n### Comment ID kca3916 with +8 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kca3916/) (in reply to ID kc8noze):\n100% this.

Open beta and early access are now really just terms for games that have been released incomplete and probably not to a good standard. If anyone who wants to can play your game you've released it. \n\nAlpha beta etc used to be testing stages in development that would tell you how close to the finished product they were. Now games release as open beta and stay that way for years taking people's money at the same time. That isn't a testing phase. That is a company trying to get money from an unfinished product. \n\nPersonally I don't think beta games should be allowed to charge. The industry is largely unregulated and it shows that these practices have become accepted and normal. And it's leads to situations like this where people have invested in something in good faith which then performs pretty poorly\n\n### Comment ID kca5c5j with +7 score by [(ImpressiveElection94, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kca5c5j/) (in reply to ID kc8yzcr):\nI agree?

While they probably had some start up money (the founders are well respected names in the Gaming industry) that money won't last forever, where do the funds come from for this long of a beta/alpha/testing? They aren't asking for a monthly fee, it's not pay to win even in whatever phase it's currently in, which I confess, is a mystery to me even now but I do recognize they ask for nothing from us. Purchasing sparkly outfits helps to keep the lights on in Palia and pay their people, you know they are hurting when they lay off 35% of their workforce and if I recall correctly they are down to just 109 workers for Palia, while 109 sounds like a lot it's really not for an Online video game, a small workforce like that can strangle a game. Outfit choices are completely optional and NOT forced on you. No one is making you purchase anything. All those people playing for free need to thank the people who do purchase the trivial things from the clothing shop, they are the ones keeping Palia alive at the end of the day. I buy their outfits and I don't even think twice about it because I enjoy the game and DO want to see it fully released and receiving updates, doesn't bother me one bit it's Beta or whatever it is currently.

But beta can't excuse all the problems  Palia has. Nor 'It iS fReE!11\". It's a product above all, and it simply must have some quality in it, otherwise it's just a bad product, free or not, beta or not.\n\nGame breaking bugs that prevent progress; quests that cannot be completed; horrible climbing. Most if not all those things MUST have been fixed in closed alpha (or at least closed beta), not be present in open beta for everyone to see. It's the job of QA department to find and fix those bugs before the game or patch it released. And those guys either don't exist, do their job poorly or have very little time to do it. Then it's management fault, making devs release new  patch every two weeks. But it can't be justified by 'It's just beta!'. It's bad decisions that lead to bad state of the game and then lead to players leaving.\n\nS6 is not a small indie studio, but right now this game is playing like some Steam early access indie game from a single developer. Or even worse, indie game from Patreon.\n\nI wish all well for Palia, but its current state is bad. If it was in alpha, sure, I would have no problem with that. But in open beta? Just nope.\n\n### Comment ID kc8jfym with +7 score by [(Shoddy-Temperature16, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc8jfym/) (in reply to ID kc7tb0d):\nQA doesn't fix bugs, QA finds and documents them. From there the bug is handed off to either the dev who owns the feature the bug exists in or more like to the production/project management staff who will decide when fixing it fits into the existing timeline and schedule. QA can in most cases argue for an increase in priority for the bug but usually a bug that is not \"this crashes or prevents players from playing the game every time for all system configuration we test on\" will end up finding it's way into the backlog. \n\nAt most places I have worked QA doesn't have access to commit code, nor are they paid enough to expect them to have that skill set. If they do have those skills they either jump ship to the game engineering side of the house or go the technical test analyst/software development engineer in test route and work on writing code to automate tests or make tools to help the manual tests work faster.\n\n#### Comment ID kc8onq5 with +5 score by [(Kirful, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc8onq5/) (in reply to ID kc8jfym):\nOkay, my bad, sorry.

I don't want to defend everything. I just want to point out that it's a work in progress. And yes, it can be frustrating to see the state of Palia. They could have prolonged the release of Open Beta to ensure that we don't have to play with those problems.

If we want more quests, areas, progression, recipes, NPCs, events, game growth, etc. we need to understand that this happens, happens often, and we need to take a breath and understand that they’re doing everything they can to get things going again (if only so they can get home to their families).\n\nThe other thing I tell myself is that this is a free game. I have had subscription games that were down a lot in the first year. World of Warcraft was one of them. I participated from closed Beta on in that game (until Mists where I got bored) and the first year was rough with downtime.

Generally you want deployment (and rollback) to be so easy and smooth that it's not stressful to deploy just whenever.\n\n> He’s had to long hours on a time crunch and then Bam!

I'm also an avid Simmer and TS4 is known for releasing a gazillion DLCs that aren't actually done all for the sake of content and revenue.

So many will be disappointed until the core issue’s have been rectified.\n\nGame life is short, beta or not and it honestly feels like S6 Palia business/road map plan will be the death of what should be a great game.

My objection is rolling out a sizable (in this game's history) patch with existing bugs not being addressed. Party invites being broken for the past two weeks  is very tangible. People bicker resources, especially flow, and being able to invite someone to your party would stop a lot of scolding as soon as it starts. Last I knew, the game was crashing when you clicked on a person's name to add them as a friend. These are fundamentals of the MMO model, and honestly essential to a game that markets itself as \"cozy.\" I'd honestly rather wait a week for the holiday update if we could get party invites and friend requests back. :)\n\n## Comment ID kc9sqtb with +13 score by [(relosa_, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc9sqtb/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nI am not really all that bothered by the bugs. Because it's beta. Stuff is just gonna go wrong, that's fine. I don't even care about the downtime. Am I pleased that it crashed/froze/required hard restart 5 times in one hour this morning and I couldn't fish? No. Am I terribly surprised it's *that* borked? Also no. Did I witness myself some of the QOL improvements and appreciate them? Very much yes. \n\nWhat I *do* care about is the unprofessionalism in communicating about it. It's immature and oddly self-centered and WAY too on-the-nose with the branding. What I'm about to say is in good faith because I *want* Palia to reach alpha, I *want* S6 to grow. Most are not gonna like it and will downvote because they don't understand the difference between business practices and branding.\n\nThere are specific things that *need* to be stated clearly in updates that weren't even mentioned. The website itself doesn't even have a server/game status page. Not everyone uses discord and it should not ever be the primary communications center.\n\nIf there's a major outage, planned or not, *especially* when they're the ones to pull it offline, that needs to be loud and clear on every platform they use. Scheduled outages should be sending emails as well. IMO it came across as that they *really* didn't want any new or casual players to know there was an outage at all. They *know* the daily players and community members would be on it. But it's the kind of thing you just have to own up to ASAP. \n\nContext: I have 10+ years in risk management, operations training, planning, comms, and hands-on emergency stuff.\n\nWhat their updates should have read like was:\n\n\"Hey everyone, we have some bad news. The patch release didn't go as planned and the demand on the servers plus bugs and errors clashed. We've taken everything offline and are investigating. While we're disappointed that you cannot enjoy Winterlight and the QOL fixes just yet, we understand this is probably even more disappointing for you. We'll let you know as soon as we have any information. You can find status updates at  \\[URL\\]. Thank you for your patience!\"\n\nOnce they had repairs under way and did not have an ETA:\n\n\"Good news is that we've located the issue and have begun correcting it. Unfortunately we don't yet have an estimated uptime and we'll definitely let you know when that changes. We do know that the issue was internal and your game and personal data is safe.\"\n\nClear, kind, respectful, informative, and not full of mealy-mouthed weirdly self-serving brand-speak that never once acknowledged the users except with really condescending comments like \"for those who are being patient\" and \"those who are sending positive vibes!\"\n\nMost of all, it comes across as *we have this under control.* But instead last night it came across as \"wow look at us doing our jobs! isn't that neat! boy are we tired!\" as if they were doing us a favor. \n\nFree or not, every player is still a consumer and S6 is a for-profit business. **This is their job;** no, I will not pat them on the back for doing it. Especially after getting it back online it's still having the same issues. What I *will* commend is if they manage the actual front-facing part well, which they did not. \n\nI know I'm gonna get downvoted for this but sorry, I'm right. I shared the messages with others in comms training and backgrounds. Some were Palians and some were not. I asked them what their impression was of the situation and they all came back with the same thing: short-sighted and unprofessional.\n\n This was a comms disaster. And it still is IMO. Not even mentioning the fact that the Switch thing was pulled with no information whatsoever and it hasn't been addressed as far as I know.\n\nBeta doesn't just mean the game itself but as a new and growing company it also means branding, crisis management, and retention. They are setting an extremely poor example of what happens when things might go even worse and if they do not sharpen communications they will not see the growth they deserve.\n\n### Comment ID kccmfjj with +3 score by [(BeneficialFault2269, Reddit, 2023-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kccmfjj/) (in reply to ID kc9sqtb):\nAgreed 100%. Due to how they communicate, which is poorly, they are not managing expectations correctly. \n\nThe silence around Switch not being released this year is very telling.\nThis in turn leads to frustration and bickering, especially in the Discord as this is where they announce anything instead of their own website with a status page. It's the same thing every single patch, it turns into \"remember it's only in beta guys\", \"send your love to the Devs they are working hard for us, \"if you're so upset about it/if you don't like it, then don't play/just leave\". \n\nYesterday someone upset over the Switch situation vented their frustrations in the Discord and proceeded to be bullied and talked down to with the phrases above and worse, with personal attacks just based off of their disappointment. \n\nS6 has fostered the community in this way with how passive aggressive they've been in coms previously and continues to do so with the examples you gave (for those who are being patient\" and \"those who are sending positive vibes!\"). \nIt's a very immoral practice when they're trying to act like we're besties (surprise, they want your money) and make people feel sorry for them which is weird and unprofessional.\n\nI've enjoyed the game and want it to succeed but with each patch it's getting further away from what they explained the game would be and while it has aspects of cozy, it's not hitting home in its current state.\n\n#### Comment ID kcdtp10 with +2 score by [(relosa_, Reddit, 2023-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kcdtp10/) (in reply to ID kccmfjj):\nThe exact same thing happened to me in the discord when I mentioned how unprofessional it was. What S6 is fostering isn't community (which would be inclusive of *all* players affected by a clearly-avoidable outage; not just \"the ones sending positive vibes!\") what they are fostering is toxic positivity which *will* lead to turning current and future players off for good. \n\nIf I was an investor in this company, I would be pissed that they don't have a dedicated PR/Comms person.

I feel like there's some valid criticism of course after all it's frustrating to be playing a buggy and unfinished game and there's some bugs that are ok in beta and some that are game breaking. Still I'm completely with you, it's a game from a new small studio, no matter how experienced the developers are they don't have the same tools bigger companies do. And beta is their best tool to test and improve their game . I'm a software engineering masters degree student and so the bugs , the time for updates, the unfinished or not yet added features are very normal for me and don't bother me. About the game itself, since I'm busy with school I end up playing for just a few hours a day but I've identified that the game is a bit \"slow\" if you wanna play everyday all the time cus a lot of tasks take time, still there's a lot to do and I haven't explored everything yet. I love most of the objectives of the game and have a lot of fun. It really helps my mental health being so cosy and playing it so light-heartedly . I'm really excited for the festive updates and yesterday I really wanted to play cus I had just came from a test at college and ofc I was sad when they brought the servers back down. but I actually joined the discord like 2 days ago and seeing the updates...they're working, they're trying.

Other small studios have done this with great effect. Coffee Stain who produce Valheim is a good example.\n\nAll patches were first run thru thier Public Test Server (PTS) before being released to the \"live\" server. Everyone who participated on the pts, knew thier game could be rolled back & progress lost as devs worked out kinks in each update/patch. If you were not prepared to deal with that you simply waited for the updates to go \"live\" and it is probably one of the most stable games still in early release.\n\nI don't doubt for a minute that the S6 team are working their butts off trying to get the game working but I also think they need to concentrate more on core game play before introducing new cosmetics.\n\n## Comment ID kcbjzm6 with +3 score by [(magvadis, Reddit, 2023-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kcbjzm6/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nY'all there is no test server we are the test server.\n\n## Comment ID kc7tlhg with +14 score by [(BosEriko, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc7tlhg/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nWhen people say the team is small i always remember how stardew was created by a single person.\n\n### Comment ID kc8cd26 with +11 score by [(JoanyC11, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc8cd26/) (in reply to ID kc7tlhg):\nUndertale, Rollercoaster Tycon, Stardew, among others were made by single people in ways that are simply extraordinary. But it's exactly that to make a game alone you need to be quite the programming genius, know a lot of different areas and spend probably YEARS AND YEARS developing. Programming is hard (I'm a software engineer master's degree student) and most of the times to develop an app much simpler than a game you need a few elements of a team like a front end and backend developer, a team to make the design, a team to make the unit tests etc etc. It's amazing what some people do but if we expect every studio to do extraordinary things it's like expecting every human that has experience with science to be Einstein or something.

I don't think it's fair to put that expectation onto everyone making games.\n\n aside from that, comparing a cozy (at the time) single player pixel game, to an open world MMO built on world building and player interactions is like comparing apples and oranges.\n\n## Comment ID kc7wqzs with +7 score by [(GotherellaBiovenom, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc7wqzs/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nI mean sure, but the lag and server disconnects just lost me 2 attempts worth of star materials for the muujin bahari, so I'm a little salty.\n\n### Comment ID kc9virh with +2 score by [(relosa_, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc9virh/) (in reply to ID kc7wqzs):\ngame totally crashed as I was hitting a starfire cicada this morning D:\n\n## Comment ID kc8wakz with +3 score by [(Terrynia, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc8wakz/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nAll my graphics downgraded themselves.

I often can see *through* the walls in my house when moving, as if it all has an issue loading. \n\nLove this game, love the devs. Hope they get it all ironed out soon. Rooting for them!

I think they wanted to do a bit of both. New content, even if it's not much, like the winter event now, so they can focus on bugs. At least that's what I see? Did I fall into a pot of Hopium and Copium? Because I really think so. They could have made more content, right? So, they seem to have their priorities elsewhere. And I hope, think, believe, it's bugs. At least on their homepage they've shown that they are aware of really much and apparently fixed much? Even though new ones creeped up...But they did and/or tried!

Some teams have grandiose visions for 1.0 and leave on the beta label years after what is essentially 1.0. I think the only meaningful metric for a game being or not being in beta is if it is selling any sort of products - which Palia is doing.\n\nAt the end of the day I don't think it matters all that much if a game is in beta or not if you are a player and not a tester. You are rightfully upset if you have issues but you should manage your expectations against the reality of the dev team size and maturity of the game itself. Palia is a recently out beta MMO managed by a small team when it comes to MMO metrics and getting overly upset that it has issues is an error on your part. Take a break from any game if you find yourself overly upset.\n\n### Comment ID kcezam0 with +2 score by [(ImpressiveElection94, Reddit, 2023-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kcezam0/) (in reply to ID kcem21w):\nI srsly don't know what counts as small, but they seem to be around 160 people. I personally would think it's still small, but hey, I dunno. Yes, the monetization. Often named and I can't debate against this being over the too for the moment. At least I think so. But I know by looking around in-game that many bought stuff, so they seem to be satisfied enough to do that. I hope I get to that point either, because I like that game. Yes, they are recently out in Open Beta. August was the start, right? I'd like to know, if there was something before that. Like a closed Beta or stuff. Even tho I don't believe it. \nAnyways, the game is still a baby. Some want to show their baby as soon as possible to others. Others want to protect them by avoiding getting it out in the world too soon. I  tend to the protect team. They could have taken their time to erase all the big bugs and start Open Beta THEN.\n\n## Comment ID kc7j52r with +18 score by [(LawnBeetle, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc7j52r/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nI thought the same thing when people were disappointed with the winter update like??

At least this was the case before all this early access stuff began. But these days it seems more like alpha, where much of the game is still being developed. With every stage of added content we get more bugs. It is just the nature of the industry.\n\nSo I try to remember that I am playing a game that is only 1/4 or 1/3 done. If it gets too buggy I suspend play until I read it has improved. I only get upset when some bug has an impact on my character or account achievement or development and it cannot be reversed or fixed eventually. Like an achievement that doesn't trigger. (Real talk: I do get upset at other lesser things. But when my clear head rules, I remind myself to adjust my expectations to acknowledge the game is a work in progress.)\n\n## Comment ID kc7kon4 with +7 score by [(Lumpy-Narwhal-1178, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc7kon4/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nhttps://i.imgur.com/6I3LjqF.png\n\n## Comment ID kc8uvp3 with +2 score by [(Terrynia, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc8uvp3/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nWhen the servers finally came up at like 10-11pm (USA central time), i went fishing and got the star quality ancient fish….. it was still a lucky day for me!

Been waiting over 4/5 years for the completion of the game! Rejuvenation I meant \n\nPlease Note: I am sober writing this post but let my past experience gaming flow here! Lol!\n\nPalia is a good game, it has A LOT OF POTENTIAL, but it also has a few things that works against it: \n\nLet's start with the paid feature- the store items are too expensive. With or without the pet as an added bonus. If you spread out the costs a little more then people may be inclined to buy more. I don't have any original ideas but others may. \n\nGame play: between the main plot objectives the game gets a bit boring, but then again maybe I Have been playing it wrong because hunting for bugs or fishing may be optional but I'm too stupid to get that whole system- would rather hunt.\n\nTransport/travel: Now as Palia is a magical world without too much technology to ruin the aesthetics it still is a medium sized map (compared to Fallout 4) tiny compared to Minecraft and the Witcher 1 and small compared to Rejuvenation and Reborn.  That being said I became totally enthralled with the idea of (DON'T LAUGH) Hunting Down a MYTHICAL STAG/Bear to RIDE AROUND! Which adds another opportunity for more shop items! Even being able to customize that stag or bear brings a whole new bag of opportunity and problems.  \n\nPuzzles: I love solving puzzles and just hunting down some items that give more lore to the environment: Like what is it with the white structures scattered throughout Palia? Where has the former tenant of your plot of land gone? Is he truly nuts or was he DaVinci or Einstein or Galileo of the Palia universe?   \n\nFishing: I hate the system but then again I don't like that feature in rejuvenation either. But don't take it out I guess I am just a bit stiff about it. Just need to get used to it \n\nBuildings: I like the system you currently have, things clip easily and although it is limited it has great potential- I would just add some rounded structures and an option for top floors and stairs, heck a floor with a hole and a pole to swing down! Vines to climb up and down!  \n\nFurniture use: I don't know I would like to be able to store clothes in a cupboard, Like say I just bought a pink party dress and a green Elvin hunting set of clothes I want to open the cupboard and see them in there, but again don't stress this too much- none of the games I played got this right either!  Which neatly brings me over to the library: I would love to browse and buy books- recipes and bestiaries, I don't know maybe checklists for maybe the bugs and fish you collect with more information per the species you've encountered area they are available in with a spot on the map, time and the kind of fishing rod and bait required? \n\nQuests: Please forgive me but there are times that the dialogue plays and something happens in real life that makes you skip the dialogue by accident: cat jumps on the keyboard, baby slaps the mouse etc. and lets say that dialogue was important but you cannot go back and revisit that conversation which means you've missed something important to the story line or a hint as to where you are to go but a list of DETAILED explanations on the quest may be good for this, I had to go look at Wiki, Google, Reddit and YouTube way too many times as some of the quest descriptions are too vague or do not give you enough information from the get-go. Or add lines and optional clues in character dialogues. \n\nRarity of resources: Now this one may be interesting- bear with me: \n\nFallout 4 has a few medicines that are EXTREMELY RARE: X-Cell, Day Tripper, AND Daddy-O. Minecraft has diamonds that were extremely rare before the newest update, Craft the World has Heroes, Pokémon Rejuvenation and Reborn have Event and Legendary Pokémon: Now bare in mind I haven't really played long enough to completely say I have a handle on what is Really Rare- except for Pallium but this also has an exploit which takes away from it's rare status. May I suggest you remove the Group bonus feature from mining this RARE ingredient? As far as I understand it is Rare for a reason? \n\nFood crafting- I want to be able to see the food I make on a plate (not sure if it's in game but I haven't really explored food crafting too much either), Can I ask that one could be able to buy them from the library too?   \n\nRelationship status: Okay Now THIS was WHAT MADE ME QUIT!  You are told to find a shepp- THAT'S IT!  \n\nYou are not told that \n\n1) YOU CANNOT ASK ANYONE with a FRIENDSHIP LEVEL BELOW LEVEL 4 to be your shepp as they Will REFUSE YOU \n\n2) You cannot ask an NPC to be your Shepp more than ONCE  and Finally\n\n3) The Shepp option is ALWAYS available in the dialogue options thus if you get tired of their drivel and skip too quickly through their dialogue you have a VERY HIGH CHANCE OF Accidently asking them to be your Shepp  and all your hard work is GONE! \n\nFallout 4 has done this dialogue option EXTREMELY well by limiting WHAT you can say to which character at different relationship levels. I am sorry I am not going through all the ups and downs of building up a relationship level again. The characters that I was interested in becoming my Shepp I made the mistake of asking too early. The others bore me to tears or irritate me enough to try shoot them with the bow and arrows (doesn't work) \n\nNow please note I wrote this with a light-hearted approach and I mean this as constructive criticism. All and all I would love to play Palia again- I like the game, but as to the shepp quest- I asked and cannot ask again so this is a wall for me in the game and I won't be returning until that is resolved. \n\nNeither will I pay to play either.\n\n### Comment ID kca3kdl with +1 score by [(ImpressiveElection94, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kca3kdl/) (in reply to ID kc92o0n):\nFirst I'd like to thank you for the time you took to write all this! 😶 And don't worry, I think of it like constructive criticism.\nNow let's get started:\n\nTo the monetization I can't say much about a better approach besides that it may have been a bit too soon, if you think about the progress of the game. I think many might not consider it \"worthy\" of getting money as of now. Me included. As soon as I get the feeling that the game gets \"completed\", I might buy stuff. But that should take time, with what I've seen up till now. But then again, I see many in fancy costumes,  so it might work out after all? How to switch the numbers for more people to buy stuff is something I can't even imagine. I'm just too poor to buy stuff higher than 20€ without batting an eye.\n\nGame play might be repetitive very fast as there isn't much story quests right now, but I'm pretty sure they'll add more. Like more ressources in each category to farm and stuff. I don't think they'll change the system as I think they want the players to be able to do just what they enjoy. At least to a certain extent. You need to mine to make your axe better and stuff. But I think that's pretty normal in games. I find the game cozy and chill besides the bugs.\n\nTransport and Travel: Ooooh, I'd LOVE that!!!\n\nPuzzles: I love puzzles, too! I think some might come with new ruins, but I'd love small ones in the overworld, too!\n\nBuildings: Yes, PLEASE! Especially stairs, as soon as I built just one additional room I wanted it!\n\nLibrary: Yes, that would be great. I wouldn't be surprised, if they already considered it for the future. \n\nStory: Yes, I feel you! Even if I saw everything,  there are times I'd like to be able to look up what was said again. Hope they add something like that. \n\nRessources: There's a group bonus for mining? I know that fishing has it and foraging Flowtrees requires you to have someone tag along if it is a fully grown tree, but mining? I might have missed something? I'm still not a veteran in this game, so there might be things I just don't know. \n\nFood: You can place star quality food in your farm! On tables, in fridges, basically everywhere with a designated surface for putting stuff on/in it.\n\nNow I get back to the clothes as it's already possible with food, so making that available for clothes would be great! Just dunno how much work that is,  as I'm no programmer...\n\nRelationship: Yes, it's not really stated that you need friendship Level 4, before they'll become your Shepp.\nBUT!: You aren't lost! You can still get the person to be your Shepp even though you asked to early! I panicked with Tish as I asked her and the option to ask just disappeared. But through the community I got to know that when you reach Level 4 with your target person and complete the quest for that, after an in-game day the option reappears and you can get your Shepp! Again, it's not stated in-game. I'd like to be informed about both cases (knowing Shepp condition and that you can ask again after Level 4 Quest) in-game.\n\nI hope that alleviates your anxiety, which I felt, too and was really, REALLY unsettling for me, and you can enjoy the game more knowing you can still get your Shepp!\n\n\n\n## Comment ID kc8wzw1 with +1 score by [(Terrynia, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc8wzw1/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nIm ok with the performance issues… now whwre is my Christmas store 🤣😂🤣😂\n\n## Comment ID kcaaztu with +1 score by [(YoshiandAims, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kcaaztu/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nBeta is a grind. Basically play testers. It's fine, I knew that going in. Palia is really enjoyable, and honestly isn't the hardest beta I've done. I want to stick it out and genuinely look foreword to what's coming.\nIt's a lot of grinding, repetition, fails, waiting, sudden changes, constantly evolving systems that Ive finally worked out and now have to adjust to allnover again, etc. \nIt can definitely feel brutal and frustrating sometimes.\nIt helps me to remind myself that we're helping them create a polished balanced product in the end for those who play after full release.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Comment ID kcixhgt with +1 score by [(kinoko_dream, Reddit, 2023-12-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kcixhgt/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nBased on the supposed budget for this game, it's lacking a LOT and contains an extreme amount of issues each time they update.

      "# Post ID 1bqq6c8: Palia Dev Update: “we’ll keep our players updated with as much information as possible as we approach what we consider to be our official launch.” with +308 score by [(kyleblane, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/)\n[https://palia.com/news/dev-update-7](https://palia.com/news/dev-update-7)\n\nFull Text (of beta section)\n\n>**Palia is Currently in Open Beta**  \n>  \n>We want to clear the air: since our Open Beta launch back in August 2023, the **game remains as a title still in Open Beta**. Know that we’ll keep our players updated with as much information as possible as we approach what we consider to be our official launch.  \n>  \n>We're aware that there has been feedback regarding our messaging and status on various platforms, but the emphasis is that Palia is free-to-play and available for anyone to try. It is a continuous, ongoing effort, and we are committed to providing patch updates with new content, improvements, and bug fixes well into the future.  \n>  \n>In fact, looking at our version, being on 0.178 means we’ve made over 178 updates to the game! Even from the start, and the days of Pre-Alpha, we made sure to include player feedback and have it shape Palia to be where it is today. And when it’s ready, we also plan to have the versioning update from “0.XXX” to “1.XXX” to better reflect Palia’s new status — but even that is not the end. We’ll keep having more patches after, and developing Palia alongside our players. That was one of the primary reasons why we wanted it to be a free-to-play, live-service game.  \n>  \n>We invite everyone to be part of this journey.\n\nFirst of all, when you need to \"clear the air\" that your game is still in beta you've failed at the most basic communication about your game.\n\nThe bare minimum required to provide \"as much information as possible\" as your game approaches launch is to properly inform players that the game hasn't yet been launched. Steam and Epic versions should be in Early Access. Switch should have some form of \"beta\" mentioned somewhere. The word \"beta\" should exist somewhere on the website other than news updates and the EULA. It's a very easy decision to make, and a very easy change to implement.\n\nThis dev update is void of any definitive action they're going to take. They only say that they are aware of the feedback and are focusing on communicating that the game is free (As if the two messages can't coexist LOL). I hope I'm wrong and this is just a poorly worded update, but I don't expect to see any communication changes regarding the beta status of the game.\n\n## Comment ID kx6h2br with +75 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx6h2br/) (in reply to ID 1bqq6c8):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID kx7hkxm with +15 score by [(OreoYip, Reddit, 2024-03-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx7hkxm/) (in reply to ID kx6h2br):\nI am okay with the conversations but honestly, it is getting a bit old hat.

The majority of people do not want that and as a mod, and a very active participant of the sub, I don't want that either.   \n\nIt is important that people know about games and any serious issues but going forward, a megathread has been created because this game and the drama surrounding it is pulling focus from other threads and attracting negative attention from people that are not in this group but want to jump in on the drama.   \n\nAs long as the conversation is kept civil, rules are followed, and there is absolutely no mention, complaints, or calls for brigading on other subs (which is against Reddit TOS and jeopardizes the entire sub), I have no problems.\n\n#### Comment ID kx7jnf5 with +7 score by [(11_roo, Reddit, 2024-03-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx7jnf5/) (in reply to ID kx7hkxm):\ntrust me, if r/palia allowed these conversations we would be there.\n\n#### Comment ID kx7j54i with +1 score by [(kyleblane, Reddit, 2024-03-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx7j54i/) (in reply to ID kx7hkxm):\nThanks for the work you do.

UI text size sliders - for people who are playing on Steam Deck for example! Brightness sliders - maybe you just prefer your games to not be that bright! And then other accessibility options  include making the temples doable without having to do complicated maneuvers and having to react at exactly the right time etc etc - some disabled players won't be able to fulfill the challenges at all as they are now, but even players who can fulfill the challenges might not want to do this kind of challenge. I personally get super annoyed with all of the temples, as the rest of the game (except for hunting and some bug catching stuff) is way lower stakes and I fucking hate when I have to jump precisely in games. So I'd profit from an option to do this challenge in an easier way, too (and my keyboard and desk would love that too cause I get really angry and frustrated 😅)\n\n### Comment ID kx4dyj4 with +24 score by [(TheSilentTragedy, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx4dyj4/) (in reply to ID kx4914c):\nAlso this. Many of my friends (many of which were active members of the accessibility channel there) were banned the other day for asking questions, one was banned simply because they wanted to know why their mute had persisted longer than it was supposed to (they were muted for an extra hour instead of the original mute time). \n\nTheir mods/devs have admitted that they have a hard time remaining unbiased regarding critic of the game - in my most respectful and honest opinion, the biggest problem they have (in regard to their Discord) is a lack of a well-acting, level-headed moderation team.\n\n#### Comment ID kx4efjj with +25 score by [(kyleblane, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx4efjj/) (in reply to ID kx4dyj4):\nEarlier on Discord I was asking about details regarding this dev update.

I base it on the reviews. But I'm reading this post from the devs and think they are back peddling due to backlash. Honestly, imo it's easier to justify bugs for games in early access. It would be to their advantage to put it under the early access banner. Why they didn't, I don't really understand. People would give them a pass for bugs. \n\nMaybe they should mention at least in the text of the steam store for the game that it's in beta. Not hidden in the announcement.

Please forgive any crappy formatting on mobile.\n\nDecember 2023 Switch update:\nNo mention of Beta anywhere on the Nintendo eshop page. For weeks leading up to the release multiple members in the discord tagged CMs asking for clarification. CMs would conveniently disappear from conversation or straight up ignore the question while responding to other members. Game launches and what’s missing from the splash page on the switch? The beta tag. The excuse then became “oh well Nintendo doesn’t do beta/early access so take it up with them”. Sandrock was quite literally hosting an early access at this time. \n\nFebruary 2024:\nThey announce the steam release. Members point out that the MMO tag has been scrubbed and there’s no mention of the game being in beta. Every week members would be tagging the CMs to ask and get clarification, warning the CMs that this would lead to negative reviews. The CM response was gifs and saying they’d pass it along to the rest of the team. Members also noted that the Palia website had also been scrubbed of the beta label at this time.\n\nBefore this they were telling people they banned for questioning the lack of beta tag that they had no control over what steam labeled the game as and now it’s too late because once a game has been published you can no longer mark it as early access and beta. \n\nI know this doesn’t matter to some people and I think that’s perfectly fine BUT for some of us a company being intentionally deceitful repeatedly is a big red flag. Many of us have played for hundreds of hours, sunk money into the game and built a community with people inside and outside of the game so we’re feeling quite passionate and honestly concerned about the way things are going. \n\nI’d also like to add this is a team that brags about being industry vets, these are people that know what they’re doing and are now trying to handwave all this away with “oh we’re still learning”. This isn’t a small indie team and hell even small indie teams know to mark a game in beta/EA. Honestly this dev update is only in response to the negative feedback there’s not even any mention of accountability, this wording it reads to me like “well it’s free so who cares”. I care! They have a cash shop and yes it’s optional BUT there is still a way for people to spend money on game by a company that is intentionally trying to mislead its player base and I’m sorry but I’m not okay with that.\n\n### Comment ID kx4ktvz with +25 score by [(kyleblane, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx4ktvz/) (in reply to ID kx4k5ml):\nBravo for good formatting on mobile.

I don’t want to yuck other peoples yum lol! I haven’t left a review and try not to speak negatively of the game even in the discord now because I can see it’s bringing a lot of people joy BUT I also feel like it’s causing people to have major blinders on.

Thanks OP for sharing and I completely agree with your take! \n\nThe update from the Palia team comes off defensive and doesn’t have any accountability in the failure to communicate the status of their game. It being free doesn’t negate it from criticism or basic expectations of knowing it isn’t fully launched. \n\nThis honestly makes me want to uninstall.

You should be happy we did (the bare minimum) hard work with sit-tech and now you can sit in chairs so stop pestering us.\" Post. (Not the exact quote but it did feel very passive aggressive)\n\nI remember saying that despite this game being free with optional microtransactions, this was going to be one of those barely updated, barely fixed games with barely anything in it worth playing but the store would be absolutely cluttered with new stuff. What happened when I stated that? \n\nDeath threats(yes. I kid you not lmfao) the typical \"It's free. Stop complaining.\", then there were the \"They're taking their time to get it right. If you don't like it don't play it.\" (I stopped around the time they dropped the news that outfits will always be microtransactions) and then people telling me that I was too poor to play the game and I was just a poor hater. Lmao. \n\nWell, despite all those people jumping my butt, I am glad but also disappointed to see that I was mostly right. It's a shame because I hoped they'd take player feedback seriously and make this a game worth sticking around for...but once again, game companies be game company-ing. Glad I didn't hang on to that hope and get let down like I am sure many others have. \n\nI am sorry to those who looked forward to this game being something amazing. Hopefully the game grind loop is enough to keep you playing long enough until a better game comes out for you. Hopefully before they decide that \"It is with a heavy heart that we shut down servers to Palia.\" When theyve finally made enough off their little money maker disguised as a free game.\n\n### Comment ID kx4rbml with +17 score by [(PlantPotStew, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx4rbml/) (in reply to ID kx4mb9l):\nThis reminds me a lot of Disney Dreamlight.

I got hundreds of hours\" Can have their fun. Ideally every game would have a redemption arc like No Mans Sky and Cyberpunk.\n\nIt's exhausting to see casual gamers defend this type of stuff again and again. Sure, they can make their own decisions*, but I thought ignorance was the issue. But it's not, they literally don't care and don't want to care, and... I see this in politics and so many other more important areas that it's just annoying. Companies/whatever are going to keep getting worse because people will keep buying/voting the same way because they just don't care. Worse, they'll shut you down so they can keep living in ignorance.\n\nI get that this seems a bit dramatic, it's just a game, but... eh. It's a pattern. Dystopian Sci-Fi writers don't see the future, they recognize a pattern.\n\n\n*Saying this, because if I didn't, they'd say that it's their right to think so.

Its a free game, I downloaded the day it released on Switch, the 0.XXX always made sense as beta for me, and I've already sunk 160 hours into Palia, more than any other game on my Switch, including ones that were $60. \n\nIs it perfect? No. Is it done? No. There are bugs and glitches but for me that was expected and as someone who is not active on the discord or subreddits it feels like people are overly pissed off about the game and being kinda dickheads to the devs. \n\nIf you don't like it or don't like the devs or don't like their communication, then don't play it! No one is holding a gun to your head forcing you to play or talk about it lmfao. I just personally don't understand sinking a bunch of time into talking about something you don't like. If the game had a cost and people had paid for it and been upset about it being in beta I would get that but like worst case scenario you downloaded a free thing and it were dissapointed because it wasn't what you expected. Okay, bummer, but like, not a huge deal?

You seem more dismissive, then interested, in learning why this could be important. I'm not the best at this topic, but-\n\n> If you don't like it or don't like the devs or don't like their communication, then don't play it! No one is holding a gun to your head forcing you to play or talk about it lmfao\n\nIs a terrible stance to take about this type of stuff. I know you'll probably say \"It's just a game\" but it's important to talk about how companies conduct themselves. \n\nMicrotransactions and other unsavoury tactics like that flourish when people dismiss them as \"Just cosmetics, game is still free.\" Despite games like this specifically attempting to make you spend your money on cosmetics (20$ for a digital outfit). When other companies notice there's a way to squeeze more money out of you, they'll start engaging in worse tactics, making levels specifically harder so you cave and buy more lives just to play the games. Or specifically making the feedback loop more addictive, or making it easier for children who aren't as aware of these tactics to buy things. \n\nYou could say \"It's the parent's job to prevent that\" But we have laws specifically to make dangerous/addictive things regulated, because we understand that the average person might not be educated enough to avoid them.\n\nI don't know if palia specifically falls into this category. But being open about EA is also important. When Disney Dreamlight came out, people bought the full game for 60$, because they specifically hid the fact that it is EA and the full game will release for free later. You're specifically buying to play earlier. It seems small, but the more stuff like that gets hidden as \"Not a big deal\" The more companies will continue to shift around things that they KNOW people want to know, and hide it because if a person did know, they wouldn't have bought/played it. You have a right to know what you are investing (Time, money, etc.) in.\n\nLying by omission, if not called out, is encouraged. You can get games who have been funded by millions only for all the news to be wiffle waffled on. And this keeps happening, because we don't talk about Early Access and the cons with it enough. Because casual gamers don't normally keep up with the news enough to see a pattern and think it's just a fluke that dumb people fell for. That they're smart and will never fall for similar predatory tactics.\n\nWhile people are supposed to make informed discissions, we also have to acknowledge that in the age of overinformation, it's not possible. If the only way to know if something is EA is by going on Twitter, or any other completely unrelated social network, you messed up! Transparency is the most important thing that can be done. If you can only tell it's a beta by seeing 0.2.4.5 version, it's not transparent, it means that people have to be tech savvy enough to understand what section of a version code means it's beta or finished.\n\nI also found from that experience a lot of casual gamers, who admit that this was their only game, didn't really understand a lot of game mechanics. Why having to spend 6+ hours mining rocks to make a basic decoration wasn't an acceptable grind, because they enjoyed doing mindless activities for 6 hours! Don't like it? Don't play it! We didn't, but before we left we decided it was worth explaining why, from our experience of MMO's gone bad, it's a sign on the wall.\n\nWhy having constant bugs and patches introduce more bugs, from experience in EA gone bad, were signs on the walls. \"All games have bugs, jeez\"\n\nWhy having the first microtransaction, from experience in mobile games, were signs on the wall. \"It's just clothing, don't like it? Don't buy it!\" despite a single chair being 20$ \"You don't need it\" Despite more things getting locked further and further, keeping an intentional cycle on FOMO.\n\nThey mostly subscribed to the same philosophy of \"It's free, and I got a lot of content out of it, so who cares about [microtransactions], [terrible dev communication], [terrible grinding mechanics]\" Which is fine, but they also refused to allow others to put in their two pence. Saying \"You're being toxic\" or \"Bringing down the mood\" or \"Why does everyone always have to complain, don't like it, don't play it!\" As if we can't have a discussion on anything but positive things. \n\nI think they see a lot of people, and forget that those individuals don't see others complaints are a part of their own, so instead of one person sharing one problem, it's hundreds sharing that one problem. Making it seem much more dramatic then it is for those people individually. I will admit some people take things too far, especially if the dev starts shutting down any mild conversations, extreme ones start surfacing.\n\nIf you've played video games for decades, you start seeing the same patterns that ruined other companies and games. You start recognizing the trend that gaming is going down.\n\nWe don't play it, but we also learned that boycotting doesn't work and companies will still cut as many corners while getting as much money as possible. We still feel like we should talk about it, at the very least, even if most people just shrug their shoulders and say \"Who cares? I still had fun.\"\n\nSorry, turned long and probably isn't as coherent as I'd like it to be.\n\n#### Comment ID kx5swdt with +4 score by [(ControlledEuphoria, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx5swdt/) (in reply to ID kx4o2h6):\nJust had to say I thought this was incredibly well thought out and perfectly coherent! I agree so much about transparency especially when it comes to beta/EA. I’m considering supporting Farmfolks even though they had a disaster of a first kickstarter based solely on the fact that the new team has been putting out consistent clear messaging. It’s so important we all do our part to try to keep companies accountable so that the beta/ea tag doesn’t immediately tank a game. Especially in the farming/cozy game community because a lot of these games get picked up by people that can’t or don’t have the time to spend navigating discords/reddits/steam forums to learn that the game they just downloaded is incomplete/has issues. Straightforward clear and consistent communication that is easily accessible to a consumer base is key.\n\n### Comment ID kx4gw5o with +11 score by [(Disig, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx4gw5o/) (in reply to ID kx4ecuc):\nYou've completely missed the point of the post.

And again, even if it didn't meet people's expectations and theyre dissapointed, that's fine, but like ??? Move on lmfao. Sitting here engaging in dozens and dozens of posts talking negatively about a game is so incredibly pointless and puts so much negativity into the space for what? Nothing.

They don't know they're buying cosmetics for an unfinished game.\n\nSecond, it speaks poorly of their management. Communicating that the game is in beta would only do good things for them and players have been saying this for a very long time. They've banned members of the Discord for questioning it, even going as far as telling them they're spreading false information. There is no good reason NOT to communicate the game is in beta, only selfish, deceitful reasons.\n\nBonus reason: It's good to be clear and honest. They have gone out of their way to remove/hide that the game is in beta, not labeling it as such in obvious, easy places.\n\n#### Comment ID kx8r0ej with +3 score by [(spidersprinkles, Reddit, 2024-03-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx8r0ej/) (in reply to ID kx79r22):\nTbh I just assume that any game that is 'free' with in game purchases is run by a company that is selfish and deceitful. I automatically think that by default and avoid those games. \n\nThey're literally designed to psychologically trick you in the hope you'll wind up spending more money than you would on a regular game. \n\nIt doesn't surprise me that S6 isn't exactly acting like the friendliest company.

In single player community sim games, it’s a common player progression arc that by the end of the game you’ve completely trivialized the core currency. As a live game, we believe we need to maintain the value of our core currencies over time, so we have set up our gold generation ecosystem to have limits.\n\nThat being said, we think there are some issues with the current execution of gardening.\n\n* Players have limited expression freedom with their gardens when they have to place them in 3x3 blocks and want to benefit from the adjacency crop buffs\n* Ability to really chase the fantasy of being a large scale farmer\n\nWe also know a lot of players are talking about how gardens only progress a single level while offline. This is a major economic consideration that would require major shifts to address, but we are looking into how we could best address this feedback.\n\nFrom what we are seeing, addressing these issues would require a significant amount of work we could do, but it would not be anything we would be able to address soon. - Forseti\n\n#### Comment ID jycbtcg with +45 score by [(zheph, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jycbtcg/) (in reply to ID jybya7i):\n> As a live game, we believe we need to maintain the value of our core currencies over time, so we have set up our gold generation ecosystem to have limits.\n\nThis is irrelevant to the game you've created.\n\nIn a game where there is a multiplayer economy, where people are buying and selling from each other, then people having access to effectively limitless gold becomes a problem because it creates inflation that makes things unaffordable for new players. \n\nThis is not a game with a multiplayer economy, and I don't see that ever changing because at that point \"cozy\" goes out the window.

There are several quests I can think of off of the top of my head that *require* hunting, which is a skill some players have moral objections to. (For example, >!Nai'o level 2 quest requires starred chapaa meat, and Sifuu level 3 requires hunting a proudhorn!<). So are you planning to create alternative ways to complete quests so players don't feel like they have to participate in a certain activity, even if they don't like doing that activity?\n\n## Comment ID jybcfhn with +68 score by [(saragrissom, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybcfhn/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nHello! thanks for taking the time to do this for us.\n\nI am wondering if there are plans for paths, bushes, flower arches, fencing, or really anything pertaining to decorating the outside of plots?  \n\n\nWhat are your plans in regards to more crops and animals?\n\n### Comment ID jybov7y with +45 score by [(Palia_Community, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybov7y/) (in reply to ID jybcfhn):\nQ: I am wondering if there are plans for paths, bushes, flower arches, fencing, or really anything pertaining to decorating the outside of plots?\n\nA: Yes!

This way we could make oatmilk. Oatmeal as well which could have variants like strawberry oatmeal, apple cinnamon, blue berry, peach, plain etc. Or you could make it Fruit Oatmeal with any fruit in the recipe.\n\nSo we'd need more fruits like Peaches, Strawberries, Lemons, Cinnamon, bananas, oranges, grapes, cherries, black berries, raspberries etc.\n\nI also think fruits should be separate from regular farmer or at least we should have cosmetic variants. That way we can have fruit trees and berry bushes as decorations. I was thinking maybe they could be functional props where you can gather from them once every few days but just decor would be good.\n\nVeggies like corn would be great for cornmeal, corn bread, corn dogs, creamy corn soup, grits (ground up corn), cheesy grits. Maybe finding some crops that would have many uses would be best. Rather than crops that'd only be good for one or two things. So, something like celery might not be a good priority. Oats, corn, most fruits, they have a lot of applications. Grapes could be used to make jam of course, but also juice or wine.\n\nA cooking method the game could have would be dehydration using a drying rack or whatever. To make jerky from meat and fish and fruit leather. It's take a long time like preserve jars, but maybe you get multiple pieces or it could provide more focus than just cooking it over the campfire. Like you get more use from it in exchange for it taking a long time compared to cooking it. It could also be used to dry out wood which could then result in sap, resin, and/or syrup or something would could be used for crafting furniture or cooking.\n\n#### Comment ID jyfd5nz with +1 score by [(Professional-Truth39, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jyfd5nz/) (in reply to ID jybov7y):\nI'm hoping since I saw what looked like a brewstand..and seeing honey I'm hoping for beer , wine, mead, sake, brandy, vodka, and various alcohol.

I think it would be so much more comfortable if you could go back to the workbench after crafting something.  \n\n\n\\- **Will you let us craft more ammo at a time than 20?**  \nGiven the fact, that after every thing we craft at the workbench, we have to go back, scroll down till we find what we crafted and then press craft *again*. Several times. I think it is *very* time consuming and it would be so much better, if you could let us craft more at a time, obviously consuming more materials.  \n\n\n\\- **Will there be added more ways to make your Palian more unique?**  \nSince Palia is only in the Beta, I don't think there is much to say yet but if so, will there be features for the body/face? Will players be able to change the nose shape or bodyweight? I think adding features like this will make the Palians look different from each other and add more diversity. Example: adding sliders or more color options for clothing and body.  \n\n\n\\- **Are more ways to make ingredients for food going to be possible?**  \nHarvesting is good! But will players be able to buy animals (Cows, Sheep etc.) for ingredients which can only be bought in Zeki's store? Could we maybe be able to hold chicken for egg, cows for milk and sheep/other animals at our plot for ingredients?  \n\n\n\\- **Will you be able to start a relationship with other Players in the future?**  \nThe romance system is really good but I think given the fact that not every NPC is romanceable I think adding the opportunity to date players would be a funny add on. I am pretty positive that you will be adding more NPC's to the game. Also adding the option to Marry one would be very important to some players!  \n\n\n# My last and most important Question!!!\n\n**Will you be releasing official Palia merch?**  \nI think it would be VERYYYYY cute to have a **Chapaa plush** in real life!

For example, the mini game rounding up the chapaas is fun, but it inherently puts the players in opposition to each other (ie, the more tickets others get, the less I get)\n\nAn alternative would be something like releasing 100 chapaas at once and the players have to round them up within a time limit. If the group gets all 100 within the time limit, everyone gets 50 tickets, if the group gets 90 of them everyone gets 45 tickets, etc. Maybe some kind of bonus to the top players. The point being, when the group wins, we all win.\n\nA lot of systems are inherently competitive and it will take creativity to design interactions that aren't.\n\n#### Comment ID jycxlew with +6 score by [(kyttyna, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jycxlew/) (in reply to ID jybfp01):\n>there is a monumental gap between the pace the average player is progressing and a top 10% hours per week player.

But I completed the main quest line in less than 3 days. And I had nearly all NPCs at 3+ relationship by the end of the first week. \n\nThe only reason I didnt cap out sooner is because I didnt understand the gifting situation soon enough and I got behind on relationship and couldnt finish the shepp quest.

And why is it 300k?** If someone wants to have 1mil Gold, why shouldn't they be able to?\n\nThis is one of the challenges of blending the community sim genre and bringing multiplayer, always online components to the game. In most other community sim games that are offline, players' ability to acquire money grows exponentially, resulting in effectively unlimited currency, and removes any decision making around that friction point at some point in the game. At that point - I imagine most players stop playing and maybe restart (I know I do).   \n\n\nFor a live service game that we want to last for years on end - we felt it was important to maintain the value of our currencies over time. The gold cap is one method of keeping the overall economy in range. When we set the current gold cap amount - we based it on earlier Alpha test engagement and earning rates. What we’ve seen since Beta launch is how much both the median player and higher earning players are actually gaining - players are playing both longer and earning more gold than we anticipated with the 300k limit. This will be something that we continue to evaluate and make changes to.  \nWe’ll be going a lot more in depth on our economic thoughts in future dev update!  - Forseti  \n**= Cosmetics Questions =**\n\nQ: Additional clothing options are pay-walled at the moment - **will players at least be able to craft our own clothes in the near future?** On the topic of clothing, **will there be more FREE clothing options in the near future?** (either through crafting or simply added to the wardrobe in a patch)\n\nA: The free outfit options we currently have are what will be available for now. If we add more free clothing in the future, we expect that all players will be able to get them, and there won’t be craftable outfits. Keeping cosmetics paid is how we plan on supporting Palia financially, and until we learn a lot more about how that’s working we can’t commit to more free outfits. However, we do plan to release more character customizations for free, such as new hairstyles, new skin tones, and facial hair. - WizardCrab\n\nQ: **Will there be more body types added to the character customization?**\n\nA: Increasing the available options in character customization is a huge priority for us. Some additional options like facial hair have a pretty clear path to deliver an end product players will be happy with, while others like body types are a lot more complex - both on the technical side and for art execution. We’re working toward a number of expansions to the character customization system and body types are extremely high on that list, but will take us some time to get right. - Eggo\n\n**=Housing Questions=**\n\nQ: **Will players ever be able to sell and/or salvage furniture items?**\n\nA: We know this is a top player request and we’re still discussing what the right solution is here for Palia, so we don’t have a concrete answer at this time. It’s not a super fun answer, but it’s the truth, so look forward to future updates on this topic. - Aidan\n\nQ: **Will the map be updated with a grid system for more efficient node call outs?** *(i.e \"Proudhorn seen at C12\")*\n\nA: Yes! A system like this is something that we’re looking into and hope to have that in the near future. - Eris\n\n**=Lore=**\n\nQ: **Are there plans to make NPCs more dynamic and \"alive\"?** (ie. giving them idle animations, have them interact with each other, etc.)\n\nA: This is a topic that comes up a lot, and we hope to have an update on that soon. Our animators are working on a lot of priorities – from future cutscenes to bespoke dialogue animations – but additional idle behaviors are on the list. We are also actively investigating NPCs interacting with the environment, which could eventually lead to them interacting with each other. - EmbrasAshes\n\nQ: **ETA: Will Romance-able NPCs serve more of purpose in the future?** (ie. Marriage, relationship perks/bonuses, etc.\n\nA: We will likely not offer gameplay perks and bonuses for romance, because we feel like players should engage in romance because they like a character not because they are trying to get a bonus. That being said, we are planning on adding additional romance levels that would include new content and features.

Free players should be able to have unique and cool outfits too, that are unlockable through quests or earned through skills. Even craftable--Maybe Jel could have a Tailor's guild just like how the rest of the skills do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am someone who appreciates the fact that they made the game free, and I HAVE spent $30 to purchase unique outfits, but the option to not look bland and boring shouldn't be locked behind a paywall.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe free cosmetics look like a lot, until you realize it's really not, and there are very limited ways to customize your character. Not enough color choices, no ability to change accent colors, etc. The outfits aren't BAD, but you can tell that they're not great either with the purpose of making you want to spend money to not look boring.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the very least, maybe it should be possible to earn Palia coins somehow by accomplishing certain feats in-game.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I have seen the other questions regarding this that have been asked, and unfortunately it looks like there won't be any more free cosmetics any time soon, for monetization purposes. It's a shame. I understand that it being a free game means they need to make money somehow, but I just don't like the way that they're going about it.\n\n#### Comment ID jybjz7n with +16 score by [(mightbedylan, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybjz7n/) (in reply to ID jybjhvg):\nI REALLY hope we get Tailoring as a skill.

We do think there *are* instances where some of those customizations can be flashy cosmetic bonuses and it’s totally okay for both of those spaces to coexist. The bar we aim to uphold is that core identity customization and representation are always free (think body types, skin tones, and some eyewear) while cosmetic expression sits more in the paid category (think mustache disguise glasses or a wig with a unicorn horn). - Eggo\n\n#### Comment ID jyd7ljg with +12 score by [(kyttyna, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jyd7ljg/) (in reply to ID jybj9d1):\n>We do think there *are* instances where some of those customizations can be flashy cosmetic bonuses and **it’s totally okay for both of those spaces to coexist**\n\nBut not for clothes?\n\n#### Comment ID jybjicw with +5 score by [(DadJoke_LoL, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybjicw/) (in reply to ID jybj9d1):\nThanks!\n\n#### Comment ID jyhj0t4 with +2 score by [(speedwave420, Reddit, 2023-08-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jyhj0t4/) (in reply to ID jybj9d1):\nPlease do this for clothes too\n\n## Comment ID jybds89 with +21 score by [(NiKras, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybds89/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nButter.

I hope you are all doing well!\n\nI have a question to WizardCrab. (nice name btw)\n\nOn February 16, a blogpost was release about the monetisation of the game. It stated that you dont want to monetize through tricks. It was a very noble statement when we know how AAA studio psychologically manipulate players to spend more money.\n\nMy question is: Why a Premium Coin system? Why not directly purchasable item?\n\nMy feeling as a player is that Palia's cashshop is not better than your competition. I really understand that it can help you funding the development of the game, but it really left a bad impression after the ealier monetisation statement.\n\nIf the current system is to be kept, will be there a way in the future to be able to spend every coin that the player have purchase?\n\nThanks for your answer on the matters!\n\nI wish Palia's team the best!

If outfits were purchased for real money instead of Palia Coins, we would be limited in how many outfits we could offer, we would have minimal options in how we could provide discounts, you might not be able to use your outfits across all platforms, and a ton of other limitations.\n\nI know it’s weird to talk about the realities of business, but this is why we essentially have to use premium currency in Palia.\n\nAs for spending all of your Coins, the changes we made to the store today (plus the Palia Coins we gave out) hopefully make this a lot better, where Palia Coin packages generally match our outfit prices.

And why you've decided to not have any free alternatives?\n\nA: I can, but I know it won’t be a very satisfying explanation to many of you. We actually had the plan to give a prototype of pets (ie Palcats) to early purchasers for a very long time - since even before a single player ever logged into Palia (and well before the project was even called Palia FWIW). A version of it was actually originally slated for our first Alpha test but we cut it to work on some critical systems that had fallen behind and needed priority. The long and short of it is that it is a thank you to people willing to purchase early, but I want to be upfront that it’s also an important purchase incentive. We think that for a new game it’s really important that the first purchases people make are overloaded with value, and pets were our best option. - WizardCrab\n\nQ: Currently the game is sparse with things that actually reward cooperation. Things like Palium ore and flow trees often lead to strife and competiveness. Can you expand on upcoming co-op features for Palia? Things like just >sitting< in the inn with your friends and playing a card game would add so much to Palia.\n\nA: Areas in which gathering experiences are leading to strife we’d generally consider to not be meeting our goals for a collaborative multiplayer experience. So expect us to continue to iterate and try new things in these spaces.\n\nIn terms of additional co-op features, some of the things we’re able to speak to at this time include being able to more closely share a plot with a friend, activities you can complete with your community, and we're assessing additions to many of our skills that will reward or require co-op to participate.\n\nWe’ve recently announced that we’re working on a variety of decor interactivity options, including sitting in chairs, which will unlock the first part of your cozy inn fantasy. Family board game nights are also super cozy to so many people around the world. So we’re fans of your line of thinking here. - Aidan\n\n## Comment ID jybed37 with +17 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybed37/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID jyfwid1 with +2 score by [(CthulhuLovesMemes, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jyfwid1/) (in reply to ID jybed37):\nI want weather so bad!

More specifically, could you shed some light on how they work? Are there only a set amount of flow trees that can spawn in a server at a time? Or does every tree just have a percentage rate of being a flow tree on respawn? Like, theoretically, could we chop every tree until it's just a forest of flow trees?    \n\n\nSecond, we've all seen the adorable ormuus at the family farm. Are there any plans to introduce Ranching for animal products? I'm sure we would all love barns and ormuus and chickens of our own, plus an alternative way to get milk and eggs. I could also see that opening up the possibility of a processor to turn those milks and eggs into cheese, butter, maybe even mayo for new recipes.    \n\n\nAnd lastly, are there any plans to add marriage into our NPC relationships?

When we see one activity start to be notably better than others, it creates a pressure on a lot of players to start doing that activity or they will feel like they're being left behind.On the tomato seed front, we started to see those pop up as a high income generating item and that led us to investigate why, and in that investigation we realized that the timer was set incorrectly in the game. The rate that players started to sell tomato seeds over other seeds was a signal for us to investigate. That investigation exposed an error that simply made tomatoes the only crop you should be planting if you're trying to make money.\n\nCake parties on the other hand are awesome and an activity we very much want to preserve, but they are generating too much income right now. We intentionally designed cooking around being a multiplayer activity, and wanted to encourage players to play in ways like this. Given the high cost to organize a cake party, we think it’s ok for this to be one of the best, if not the best value generating activity in the game. We’re discussing options to bring the income earned down while preserving the overall benefit of this activity and will share when we have a path forward. Long term, the better solution is adding more dishes of this complexity to ensure players aren’t just making celebration cakes at these parties, but other dishes and multiplayer activities as well. - Forseti\n\n#### Comment ID jybp827 with +19 score by [(theadverbnoun, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybp827/) (in reply to ID jybicst):\nThank you for this answer, Forseti. I do want to say though that the only real block I've found in progressing through the story is actually gold. I never have enough to buy all the \"Fine\" tool recipes and such, much less to expand my house the way I want. And without those better tools, I have trouble with certain quests--take, for example, the difficulty of catching a Void Ray with the Standard Rod, which I need to pass the first Night Sky bundle.\n\nAdmittedly, I was one of the people who made mad money off of tomatoes--I thought the pricing/timer was intentional, though. There aren't nearly enough ways to make gold in the game given how reliant the story is on gold, and so it bothers me that tomatoes were nerfed without providing another option. Especially since this update included a fresh gold sink in the form of wildly expensive Maji Market items.\n\n#### Comment ID jybkol1 with +36 score by [(Risvixyn, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybkol1/) (in reply to ID jybicst):\nWhy not buff other ways to make money rather than continuously nerfing ways the community finds to earn it? Everything costs SO much (60k for a maji plushi?!) it doesn't feel like there are any ways to earn the income without spending 24/7 on the game UNLESS you do cake parties.

Not everyone has the time or honestly the mental capacity that those take. I like logging on and watering my tomatoes and being chill and cozy, having to go to a huge party where there’s a list of rules to follow, roles assigned, pressure to cook the right things, and on top of that needing to either organize it or find one that has an open slot with items that you are able to provide. It’s great for those who want to do it, but now the pressure that you were referring too is increased ten fold to do the only alternative you’ve left. \n\n3) If the issue you found was the timer was wrong, then why would the solution be to DECREASE the timer and cost an additional tomato rather than just increase the timer. It seems there was never an error in the first place if that was the solution and the timer was an excuse to nerf the seed profits with cause, making it seem like it was always supposed to be that way.\n\n4) The money was honestly such a non issue, so I don’t get why it needs nerfing in the first place. There are so many things to do and buy, especially if events are going to have limited time items, that being able to afford the things is motivating to keep playing and saving for the things you want to buy or the vision you have for your house. Having earnings nerfed for anything and taking longer and longer to buy the things that get more and more expensive is very demotivating to continue gameplay. \n\nHope this input helps as I’d love to continue the gameplay I was enjoying!\n\n#### Comment ID jybofp7 with +40 score by [(LeftFeature404, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybofp7/) (in reply to ID jybicst):\nI dont think yall realize not everyone is a social butterfly who is comfortable playing in big groups to cook.

Thats bad gameplay design. If you're going to have that, you really need to look into making the other gameplay loops just as profitable (or at least close to similar) and encourage people to group up for those. Why group up to hunt when you can make say 10k-20k when you could just default to the cake party and make 100k.\n\n  \n\nNerfing tomatoes for that reason, but allowing only one profession to make high end money like that just makes no sense. Hope this gets addressed sooner than later. I know a lot of my friends are already talking about quitting the game based on the responses they've seen here today as well as past issues that have arose, such as terrible communication with game breaking bugs that prevented a ton of people from progressing in certain things, yet rushing to fix a cosmetic bug that allowed players to \"equip a pet\" temporarily.  \n\n  \n\nI know there is a decent amount of ex-blizz employees working here, but it sure seems like they are bringing the bad aspects of Blizz to this game, and it shows every time you look around.\n\n#### Comment ID jyc2kzc with +4 score by [(rosedragoness, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jyc2kzc/) (in reply to ID jybicst):\nHello devs! My IGN is rosedragon and I held cooking parties since close beta. I have my own spreadsheets and held parties through my friend's discord, and while I get to realizes cake is where the money at, I was intimidated at first with how many players it need. Eventually, people get used to cooking together and dare to do cake parties with me (and eventually others after LFG revamp) but I do also aware that some of my community members shrunk from these too-big group. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think S6 should consider lifting up activities that people are less interested instead nerfing things that work. Tomato seeds profit ain't that big, either the sernuk hunting. I get the idea you want people to work together, but there are a lot of people that play MMO solo and only interested in small gathering with their close friends. Sadly, I have no good idea on how to make other activities than cooking more attractive to do together, but I think I have idea for cooking. Money wise: to my calculation.. you can get 70-100k per hour with cake party (15 people), 40k per hour with apple pie party (6 people), but barely anything for recipes that only have 3-4 people. How about.. keep the cake, up pies to 60k/hour, and have at least one 3-4 people recipe gives 40k/hour? Diversity wise: How about adjusting it so there is food best for cooking for focus and reduce the focus gained from foods that best for coins? I tried making focus food before, but on end game it seems pickles solve all my focus problems. How about adding more buffs? Food that reduce tools damage, food that increase movement speed, increase bug catching %, and so on just like how Palia did for fishing? \n\nThanks!\n\n#### Comment ID jycuk2s with +4 score by [(HenryLoenwind, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jycuk2s/) (in reply to ID jybicst):\nDon't attribute one féffect to a random cause when there are other differences that could cause it. My decision to plant tomatoes was based solely on the fact that they need the least amount of re-planting (a very annoying step), not on doing any kind of math regarding the yield.\n\nAside from a very visible but also very small group that goes into great detail in investigating and calculating through every detail of the game, next to nobody would have been aware that tomatoes had a higher gold yield than other produce, but everyone who has ever planted them knows that they can be harvested multiple times per planting.\n\nWhen reading Discord, one thing that pops up regularly when people post their optimised farm layouts is \"I gave up on puzzling out farming layouts and just put down tomatoes because it's so much simpler\". A clear sign that people chose tomatoes for their simplicity and lower time investment, not their higher yield.\n\nAs such, I feel the proper fix would have been to adjust the tomato seed sell price to reflect that they only take 2 tomatoes to produce, not to reduce the amount of tomatoes any plant yields (by increasing the amount of tomatoes that go into replanting).\n\n#### Comment ID jyhaokv with +4 score by [(RandoGamerGuy, Reddit, 2023-08-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jyhaokv/) (in reply to ID jybicst):\nYou have already started to foster a community of toxicity and exclusivity. I have observed and experienced this numerous times myself when spending time in Bahari looking for Palium nodes and Flow trees. Only a small percentage of players seem to care about helping out other strangers in your envisioned \"work together\" gameplay style. There is more often a single player, or established group that often plays together, that goes around and harvests these materials for themselves. In one instance, a player with a palium pickaxe was **racing** me to palium nodes and destroying them before I could reach them. All it required was for them to give me a few seconds of their time to make one single hit in the collaborative spirit I thought Palia was aiming to be.  \nYour opinion on cake parties and \"wanted to encourage players to play in ways like this\" is just adding to the same problem. These groups of people are people that play together regularly and bring that \"pack\" mentality to the rest of the game.  \nInitially I was thrilled to anticipate a game where random strangers can contribute towards a common goal, but it has very quickly become apparent that Palia will never be that way.  \nIt will be selfish solo\\\\pack players that get some sense of gratification from taking away from the \"new\\\\weak\" players because it gives them a sense of superiority.  \nI am not trying to generalize and include EVERYONE that partakes in cake parties, but it is very clear that people that play together frequently, will usually consider their own pack above anyone\\\\everyone else.  \nYour community consists of pockets of players that are COMPETING, not collaborating and they are destroying the experience for those of us that were dreaming of a cozy, relaxing, collaborative experience.  \nThe idea is a grand and great one, it was just implemented poorly.  \nI will probably stick around a bit longer, but boy am I glad I didn't spend the money I was burning to spend when I initially started playing the game.

I’ve got a few questions.\n\n1. Do you guys plan to do devstream once in a while? I find it the best way to communicate with your community.\n\n2. Can we to expect gradual changes to Killima Village map if there’s ever new content being added to the game? Like when introducing new characters, they will need a house and such and I love seeing old map in new light.\n\n3. Can crafting station be reworked so that we don’t need to craft multiple crafters and instead, crafting licenses will allow you to add a new slot. Example: Seed Maker have a default of one slot. Crafting License will increase to 2 slots and so on.\n\n4. Why don’t the game have cutscene for many of the friendship/romance event. Nai’o family came over to my place for dinner and all I get was a dialog and black screen. It was disappointing for a special occasion.\n\n5.

There's also a gold cap in place, a limit on 9 soil plots, and the inability to really kind of interact with your space besides plunking things down on it. So I'm curious what the devs envision as ideal player interaction with their environment and the community when said milestones have been reached -- what keeps the players logging in after bumping into the various soft limits? \n\n2) Are there any plans to introduce more long-term focused achievements or milestones?\n\nFor example, FFXIV has achievements such as mining 100, 300, 1000, 5k, 10k high quality items, which exist as aspirational content, alongside more attainable achievements such as 1k - 3k normal quality items from within a specific zone or something (similar to what you've got atm). The super long term ones help make it feel like you're not wasting progression, while also not compelling participation, since they don't reward anything fancy beyond a title.\n\n3) Why nerf tomatos but not cake parties? Feels a bit weird / out of touch.

Will you ever do tihngs in more European friendly hours? It's 3am and we would get to miss out asking questions because of this.\n2.

I have two questions which are somewhat related.\n\n1) I would like clarification from a statement in the February 16 blog post:\n\n> There’s a corollary of this that we want to be upfront about: **if you can’t buy the things you earn, it also means you won’t be able to earn the things you can buy.** Ultimately, we believe that by separating these systems, we can ensure that we’re always designing what’s best for gameplay while selling products that are worth purchasing for what they are. We believe this is the right balance to make the best game experience we can. \n\nI do believe it is fair that furniture we can currently craft is not something sold in the shop. And costumes currently in the shop, and the cats, are not available to earn in the game as they are currently.\n\nThe clarification I would like is if this means that all costumes will **always** be a monetary purchase, all pets will **always** be a monetary purchase, and all furniture will **always** be earned in game. That you will never present a mix. Such as furniture sets sold in the shop, and clothes/pets earned in the game.\n\n2) Also you offer a coin package of 425 coins. Will there ever be anything that can be purchased for 425 without purchasing a more expensive item first (such as the first item in a bundle for 850 coins?)\n\nThank you\n\n## Comment ID jybd6mm with +5 score by [(theadverbnoun, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybd6mm/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nHi team!!

I love a lot of the PARTS of some of these costumes, but seeing as they're bogged down to hat/shirt/pants, I don't really feel the need to even consider buying any of them. If I'm going to put money into cosmetics for a game, I need more mix-matching than 3 categories. If I could change out gloves and shoes, just as two decently easy examples, that's already made the outfit system 10 times more flexible. There's also some back items, such as the backpacks on the farmer bundle, the lute on the bard, the jetpack on the steampunk bundle... that could easily be clipped into their own models for even more customization. It would take a bit of effort, but the payoff would be phenomenal, and it'd definitely be easier to do now, while there's still not a ton of cosmetics in the game, and it would further expand possibilities in the future.\n\n## Comment ID jybiq84 with +6 score by [(Torkoro, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybiq84/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nThank you for amazing game, but I have questions regarding current game status and roadmap\n\nCurrent game status:\n1.

This game is absolutely everything I need in my life. It gives me a very much needed break from the monumental amount of stress work places on me. I can literally just submerse myself in the world of Palia and learning about the lore and characters has been an amazing feature within this game. The pace is wonderfully done, I don’t feel obligated to have to grind or continue and i can just casually do WHATEVER I feel like focusing on. \n\nSeriously. You guys/gals/theys have a beautiful product in the works and I am more than eager/excited to see where this game takes us. There’s still so much we don’t know about the world. There have been hints dropped by different NPCs and I cannot wait to see other cities, discover more ruins, find out what happened to the world and humans, and how magic really plays a part. \n\nAlso, S6 team you are doing a great job professionally answering and addressing all the questions. There’s been so much toxicity and hate regarding the beta and the developments but you guys take note and continue to drive on, with improvements.

If anyone wants to pull off a particular question and reuse it as a dedicated question feel free.\n\n***The Questions that are really harsh***\n\n* Why do we have ABSOLUTELY NO accessibility options. Like absolutely 0? This seems incredibly sad that the team has no cares for people  with disabilities. Trying to figure out uncommon fish - can’t because color blind settings don’t exist. Have a hard time with H/E coordination - too bad you won’t be cooking. Have issues with holding click - too bad you won’t be fishing. The list goes on….\n\n* The new event is not co-op, or player friendly, and is leading to a ton of griefing - thoughts?\n\n* Will we be getting more farming space anytime soon? \n\n* Why was no compensation given for the whole uhh situation lately(crazy extended downtime, lack of communication, the whole plot stealing, etc)\n\n* What is the thought process to adding pets (a huge component to ‘cozy’ games) and locking it behind a pay wall?\n\n* The new event stamp card is essentially a battle pass, with FOMO all over it - wasn’t this completely against what you guys said was no fomo?\n\n* Why are Palia coins even a thing, if not to be deceitful, allow direct purchases of cosmetics.\n\n* Will you be hiring any additional support staff to answer tickets - I have multiple going on two weeks old\n\n* What payment or PII are you storing when we make a purchase through stripe - your support team has directly accessed users payment methods and that should not be possible.\n\n***MMO Questions***\n\n* Can you clarify when we will be getting more mmo like features?\n\n* Community features of any kind? shared plots, etc\n\n* Raising the server size to something substantial?\n\n* Ability to select server number directly rather then randomly \n\n* Any outlook on allowing us to spin up private maps so our community only can be in Bahari?\n\n***Game Balance questions***\n\n* What is the thought process to nerfing what players are finding fun(hunting previously, now with cakes)? \n\n* Currently using the best method of gold farming it will take over 1,000 hours to get the 100,000,000 gold achievement - that’s a little over the top : don’t you think? \n\n* Why has the design philosophy been nerfs to ‘overpowered things’ and not buffing others? Such as mining for ore being substantially worse then hunting.\n\n* Will we get a buff to spawn rate of deer in the town map? \n\n* When will we get a balance patch to make upgrading all the tools actually worth it?\n\n* When will we get a solo friendly way of obtaining flow tree wood\n\nCommunity Engagement Questions:\n\n* When will we see the mods on the Discord server being held to the same standard for everyone - the amount of bans handed out for weird infractions does not make sense.\n\n* Why did the entire community team disappear and go radio silent after the last patch - is that the type of engagement we will have after ‘bad’ patches? \n\n* When will the community team start using Reddit, Facebook or/and Twitter ; rather then ONLY Discord to push important communication.\n\n@EmbrasAshes - thank you for what you did within your role ; it’s the one part of the game that has no issues and you should feel super proud!\n\n@Fabcypants could you care to explain what happened that made the 2 hour maitenance a 8 hour maintenance and what you’ll be doing to ensure this doesn’t happen moving toward \n\n@Wizardcrab not giving out a free cat and charging for skins is a super bad decision and I hope whoever decided that gets absolutely reprimanded.

I'm here with two questions that I have seen a lot of rustling about but not brought up in here (unless I missed em!)\n\n1) we need duplicate cooking stations to have a fully functional kitchen, and I don't mind that, I understand the rationale behind it! But none of the cooking stations mesh very well with each other or with the rest of the furniture. Is there any possibility of being able to customize these so that they match better with other sets, or at least match better with each other? It's very hard to make a nice looking kitchen at the moment!\n\n2) there have been a lot of complaints about finding the rare fish, whether they are needed for the bundles or not. I know people have completed it without issue, but I have seen people talking about spending thousands of worms to get a specific fish, with absolutely zero way to influence your luck one way or the other. I have fished in a lot of video games, it's one of my favorite pastimes to do in a video game, and used to be one of my favorite pastimes in real life too! this is one of the only games that puts this much emphasis on fishing that I've seen that doesn't also give you some way to influence whe\nther or not you're actually going to get the fish you want?\n\nEven in ones with very relaxed fishing, like animal crossing, you can use things like fish bait to draw fish to a specific area and then try to spy the size to see if it's the fish you want, being able to cast specifically for the size of this you want. With this game it's just cast and wait, and even if you cheese it a little bit by not reeling it in when it's not the fish you want, it can be hours or even days or weeks before you get the thing you want. What's the rationale behind this, is it truly just a way to have a natural time gate? Is this something that has been discussed in terms of changing in the future, and if not, are people catching these rare fish like the unicorn and void ray at the speed you are expecting?

Are there any plans to add ways to get non-produce cooking ingredients ourselves? Like milk and eggs would require keeping animals, or cooking oil could be produced by the player. \n\n2. Would it be possible to add a little freedom to the pets where instead of following us they could wander free on our home plot? \n\n3. I'm very interested in hairstyles as a way of self expression, are customization options besides addition of beards in the works? Would you be willing to consider a design contest at some point for players to submit hair (or even clothing) suggestions? \n\n4. What are your thoughts on gold sellers and have you given any thought on how to combat them?

The problem with Palium is that it's scarce. The problem with flow trees is that there isn't an easy way to direct players to them. Players in this game bend toward co-operative play more often than competitive, so our community seems to have the reasonable expectation that the game is a co-op experience even if some mechanics are currently hostile due to lacking QoL or design flaws.\n\nChapaa Chase is designed to be hostile though, which is so antithetical to the game's design that I cannot imagine what conversation went on in a board meeting to possibly justify its existence to the lead designer...\n\n## Comment ID jybr92s with +5 score by [(Gl4dios, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybr92s/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nwhy are we not getting any more renown for talking to NPC as soon as we hit max friendship? i have literally no incentive to talk to any of them anymore after im hitting Level 4 friendship/relationship\n\n## Comment ID jycbp57 with +5 score by [(9Ld659r, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jycbp57/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nThank you guys for doing the AMA.

I literally saw someone saying they were going to report another player for not sharing.\n\nThe fact is, is that there will always be more resources, and you should have gotten there first if it bugs you that badly.\n\nNow if a player is close by to you, it's rude if you don't wait for them, and the same goes for if players are doing call-outs and you just run up and break the resource without waiting. I do agree that that is rude.\n\nBut simply not sharing doesn't make someone a horrible person--not everyone has the time to spend waiting for 5-6 players on the other side of the map picking up every resource on the way there.\n\n## Comment ID jybafd5 with +9 score by [(ezramannon, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybafd5/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nI would love to hear more about your (all y’all) original vision for the game and whether the game is still on that path.

So I'll start with some simple ones:\n\n1.Are you aware of the increasing frustration and anger towards the game?Ever since the \"pets\" were introduced, and now with the aggressive PVP minigame from the maji market, people have been getting angrier and angrier, and leaving the game. Why were people's questions and feedback never answered? Are we going to have ANY free pets that aren't just a pointless cosmetic that does nothing and stays out of your camera 90% of the time? Is the chaapa chase game going to be fixed to be fair to players or are we going to continue stealing and fighting each others? Because that's already caused a ton of toxicity and hate.\n\n2. Why is something like a plushie worth MORE than my bloody home? that makes no sense! A house expansion is cheaper than some of the fair food!And no, thats not to say \"make expansions pricier\" good god no, thats just going to make people hate the game even more. its to say lower the pricessssss. its bad enough its a timed event that already doesn't have as many days as promised!The economy of the game is extremely unbalanced, too expensive overall, and frustrating.It promotes stressfull non stop grinding, the OPPOSITE of a cozy mmo.Also constantly nerfing the ways people find to even make a scratch of money is raising the anger higher. Whats the point anymore?\n\n3. resources are too few, too competitive. People will literally mine or chop wood resources in front of people who are waiting for others to share it with and run off with them. this has caused name calling, lots of blocking, stealing, camping, and struggling with finding resources. What are you doing to fix this?\n\n4. why do we have so much plot of land, when we get only 9 plots to farm with? why? just...why?! for a farming game, there sure is a very limited amaunt of farming. it feels more like a side gig I run while I have to do everything else to even ATTEMPT to make some money.\n\n5. what are you doing about the furniture career? its at a huge disavantage compared to the other skills just because we can't sell our hard work. it clutters our inventory, we can't used them.  There is no sorting system for furniture at all, which is a pain. half of it can't be placed right, about 50% don't match their icons on the list, none of it is functional and even painting some of them makes no difference at all. so what are the plans to change this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n6. can we have an actual gardening career rather than just farming? I want to plant all sorts for flowers, bushes and trees in my property to make it look pretty. outdoor furniture is a must  \n\n\n7. are there any plans to make community (guilds) based plots, where we can work together to build our guild and run it? its a huge opportunity for co op\n\n## Comment ID jybaghj with +5 score by [(Decent_Stock8801, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybaghj/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nWould there be anyway to have like a full on relationship with another player in game not an NPC?\n\n### Comment ID jybdnni with +1 score by [(Decent_Stock8801, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybdnni/) (in reply to ID jybaghj):\nWould there be anyway in game to make a trade post?\n\n## Comment ID jybcekp with +6 score by [(metalslug123, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybcekp/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nWill there be some kind of visual aid to help make aiming with the bows easier?

It feels super punishing if you have limited play time and can't attend every event.\n\n## Comment ID jybfa4o with +3 score by [(stargrl30, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybfa4o/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nThank you for be game! \n\nWill there be new characters to romance in the future?

To me it seems that balancing resources in an open world is a difficult task while trying to maintain “cozy” feel. I was slightly disappointed to find the lack of system depth in the economy, and maybe thinking that you’ve sacrificed system depth to avoid intense economy balancing. \n\nSo My question — what is your current thought process regarding maintaining a resource-based economy (and core gameplay loop) in a multiplayer environment?\n\nFollow up question — does it have anything to do with Palia being client authoritative? Also, why is Palia client authoritative?\n\n## Comment ID jybpxtt with +3 score by [(ThatVanguard, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybpxtt/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nIs there any chance for adding instruments?

A decent statement on its face. However we’re only seeing things you can BUY and nothing you can EARN. No outfits, no cosmetics. When will the “you can’t buy things you can earn” part of your statement become a reality?\n\nTo the community team: When can we expect the moderation team to enforce rules the same for everyone instead of just muting/kicking/banning people they dislike and only taking action against certain users if they are reported on via ModMail? Even though they’re apparently ‘watching’? At what point can we expect them to be proactive about their jobs?\n\nWhat is the OFFICIAL stance on bigotry? We never received one, just “the story so far.” And why have you taken a harder stance on AI art than you have bigotry? Isn’t this an “inclusive” company making an “inclusive” game?\n\nFinally, what about Palia in its current state is worth a player’s time and money? What is this game offering, in your own opinion, that other games don’t already offer us? What makes you different? Why should we continue to have faith in you after breaking nearly every promise since the announcement of Palia?\n\n## Comment ID jybb9aq with +5 score by [(choco-kun, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybb9aq/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nHi, \n\nI understand there is likely a large number of support tickets that have been raised by the players, and this will take time to work through.

My questions reflect a few others that have been asked;\n\nWhat is your target audience/market for this game? It seems to be geared towards younger adults instead of \"everybody\", as evident by the lack of romance options for those of us above thirty.\n\nHow will the Switch release effect the PC players? Decor limits? Building limits? With a previous game I played that had similar housing features, the building aspect was severely limited due to consoles having less computing power than a computer, which dampened the pc players overall enjoyment.\n\nOne last question regarding the lack of language editing in your game...do you have an employee specifically tasked to review and proofread your content before release? From what I see users in the Discord server are encouraged to post pictures of editing mistakes, essentially doing this job for the company, which seems odd.\n\nEdit: Okay, and one more question...do you plan on having Palia merch for sale? The proceeds may help to financially support the game as well, along with real life plushies, and such things.

Please… omg please. Wait, one more… why do we have to pay to fast travel!??! \n\nWith all of that said, I’ve been a long for the ride since alpha and I have to say I am so very pleased with the progress I’ve seen. I know this is a monumental undertaking, and I see it is a labor of love. Thank you for everything you’re doing. Palia is cozy, warm, and fun. It is (almost) everything I’ve wanted in a game for a very, very long time.\n\n## Comment ID jyblvba with +2 score by [(VortexMagus, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jyblvba/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nWill you add more multiplayer communication features for people in parties?

Some sets have a lot of furniture types that cover a lot of bases while others are severely lacking.  Mixing and matching sets doesn't work to well at the moment since a lot of furniture clashes even with the limited dyeing from the modification sets.\n\nI'm aware that some furniture sets have pieces on the Black Market, but there still missing parts from them all.  For example, the Ravenwood set has a Wardrobe and no dresser.  I do not feel the two items cover the same thing when it comes to designing a room since more bedrooms have a closet and a dresser.  \n\nSimply put, some sets are lacking and I wonder if there are plans to add more to existing furniture sets?\n\nAdditionally, are there plans for more outdoor foliage like bushes, large flower beds, and stone or wood paths?\n\n## Comment ID jybn1th with +2 score by [(gdihq, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybn1th/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nFinding out that flow usage isn't technically illegal for humans was kind of an \"Ah ha!\" moment.

I don't have a question but I would like to make a statement. I'm the exact target demographic for this MMO, and so are my friends. In fact I referred 5 of them. \n\nI think this game shouldn't be an MMO. Players compete for resources, griefers use cheat engine of all things to *steal furniture* (is your DB admin/admin?), and nobody really seems interested in talking or interacting at all. In fact I haven't really seen any benefit to this being an MMO. Cozy, lite, or otherwise.\n\nAnd as much as I'd like to support your game, I'm not paying $20 or more for *one color* of *one* outfit. I'm also not going to buy a pet. The optics of the first new feature being added to the game, being a strictly paid cosmetic, isn't great. \n\nI've paid $100 for Disney Dreamlight Valley and I've paid $145 for Animal Crossing: NH (2x game copies, and 1 DLC). I've also bought Stardew Valley twice. The difference is that these games are single-player, playable offline, and don't charge egregious amounts for very limited cosmetics. They've also implemented some pretty significant gameplay features before asking for more money. **T****he total that I'm going to spend on Palia in its current form is $0.** \n\nI'd love to change that if down the line some priorities and decisions are reevaluated and a more feature-complete version of the game is packaged and sold as a standalone, offline, but optional co-op experience. As it is I can't in good faith support this game, both because of the priorities and choices so far, and IMO the very real risk that it does not have a fair, firm monetization model that will be able to support its continued operation.\n\n## Comment ID jyba4wm with +3 score by [(Econecroz, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jyba4wm/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nHello, i have a few questions, silly ones:\n\nWhen are you going to add a feature to login screen when we can use TAB to switch between mail and password?\n\nWill be parties be useful in the future?

For as unique as it is, it's criminally undercooked as an outfit. The outfit is visibly split into a top and bottom piece, but is a single-item one-piece outfit, and this alone can be deceptive if people look to mix and match it, since we can't preview outfits in the wardrobe, and we're forced to buy each outfit as a bundle (as in, the items are bundled, not bundling the 3 different versions).

It's overpriced and uses the scummy practice of making you buy more coins then you need for what you want. Many times the player base has expressed that we're happy to financially support you but are unhappy with the current system as it makes us feel like cash cows and not valued players. The cash shop has turned many people away and honestly I don't blame them. Why are you charging prices like the cash shops of Final Fantasy 14, World of Warcraft, or even decade old mobile games like Summoner's War? $30 for a single outfit is not only insulting, it's unreasonable and out of budget for many people who would love to be able to toss some money your way over the life of the game. \n\nI can't help but feel the current cash shop is short sighted and would like to know if there are plans to fix it by lowering the overall cost of all items as well as changing to direct purchases instead of the (always) scummy practice of making players buy coins?\n\n## Comment ID jybat7m with +1 score by [(gdihq, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybat7m/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nThe pets are super cute, are there any plans to have them be more active?

I have a few questions, but first, I want to say thank you for your continuous work on Palia; this game has been a bright spot for me and many others, and the fact that you are committed to making this game the best it can be is appreciated.\n\n1. What was the mindset behind deciding to release this game as an indie game, versus an AAA game? Most MMOs I've seen are from AAA developers, so I'm curious why you decided to branch off and release Palia as an indie MMO.\n2. Were there any unexpected hitches during development that you had to find workarounds for? If so, how have those workarounds affected the game as we see it currently?\n3. How does team-management work in regards to the development team? Coordination and compromising must be a big part of development, and I'm wondering if you could give any examples of a feature that had to be removed for one reason or another?\n\nOnce again, thank you so much for making this outstanding game, and I wish you the best!\n\n## Comment ID jybcdht with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybcdht/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nHello Palia Team,\n\nI was wondering when you guys will be working on the community function in-game as well as how will it be worked?\n\nThank you,\n\nLadyG\n\n## Comment ID jybd6rz with +1 score by [(mikeytlive, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybd6rz/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nWhen can we expect our first content update? \n\nDo you guys have any plans to make the skills progression system better?\n\n## Comment ID jybegbp with +1 score by [(Routine_Impact_3284, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybegbp/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nHave you ever thought about a big flow tree that will require 10, 15 or even 20 players to chop it down with a respawn of 12h, and a palium ore as well with the same respawn rate? and it could drop like 15 or 20 ores or planks?\n\nThere is any thoughts about farm animals, like cow, cheep, chickens etc etc...\n\n## Comment ID jybehqr with +1 score by [(RinaRin_, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybehqr/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nHello. \n\nI was wondering if more free to play clothing and hair customizations are coming in the future?

Why on THIS outfit is it locked together when it follows the same pattern as others?\n\nI was intending to wear the outfit with the cowboy hat (please add more wide brim hats) and some pants (short shorts or work jeans).\n\nCan there be a further focus of prioritizing designing outfits so that they include THE WHOLE GENDER SPECTRUM...when possible?\n\nYou could have gotten a sale out of me with the Traveling Trader set, but made it fem-presenting only and left out the other part of your market.\n\nI had to request my money back for misleading me into thinking it was like other oufits without communication.\n\nI really liked the backpack and top, sadly, I had to request a refund.\n\n(would love to see a masc version of this set with cloth shorts and sunhat btw)\n\nUnrelated but still about Cosmetics...\n\nAre there plans to separate out shoes and backpacks for more customization?\n\nWould love to mix and match more styles, but given how constrained the system is (such as I want short shorts but you only let me wear them with flip flops)...\n\nHaving a variable system, especially when it's just model-to-skin like shoes for shorts...the ability to swap them when possible. Same for backpacks if an outfit accounts for one and you can swap the models and it work...let us swap it.\n\nThen communicate with a highlight system what in your menu can be swapped out in that section.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\----\n\nTLDR\n\n1. Please communicate when an item is only a one-piece vs a top/bottom split BEFORE purchase in a clear way (such as a small human icon highlighting in different colors the sections to denote if it is 1-2-or-3 separate pieces). This will reduce the amount of bottlenecking in your refund process that will occur due to lack of information.\n2. Please when designing outfits, include as many people on the gender spectrum as possible in a design OR release them in couples. It sucks to be left out of a really cool set (the backpack and top are my favorite things added so far but I HATE the pants and hat)...but I can't buy it and regret having to go through the refund process because it wasn't properly inclusive.\n3.

The majority of people playing are casual. We have a thing called work and a life. Things are too expensive. Yet you nerf things left and right because of these hardcore players who spend an entire real day in the game. That is not fair at all to the majority of players. I've been playing for quite a while and have never gone over 30k. I couldn't even get the large overpriced dragon prize during the event. Game devs really need to stop basing all their economic thoughts on hardcore players. Plus, this is a single-player game where you interact with other players. There is literally no economy that would break the game. You do trade skills and gathering skills to make a pretty house. That's literally it. There is no trading apart from sending people gifts. You want people to chill and relax playing? Then stop turning it into a grindfest... I am starting to lose interest because it's so difficult to earn gold in the little time I have to play.

      "# Post ID 15qc2j1: The moderation and community on Discord are TERRIBLE. with +99 score by [(BrettGrell, Reddit, 2023-08-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15qc2j1/the_moderation_and_community_on_discord_are/)\nAs if the lackluster state of the beta was not enough, Palia's discord is among the worst communities I have ever been a part of. The culture of \"inclusivity and coziness\" they are trying to cultivate has failed, and it has failed miserably. A big part of this the fault of the way their discord is moderated. I want to be very clear that I'm not trying to bash the moderators as people, but as moderators, they are terrible at what they do. \n\nThere was a discussion in the discord today about non-English speaking members of their community and how they are unable to advertise or speak in their native language. This is something I am very passionate about. I completely understand that it is an arduous task moderating multiple languages, and it is okay to not have the resources for that *at this time.* However, not having an outlet to direct non-English speaking members is completely unacceptable. The posts in the channel where people advertise their communities and the discords associated with them are *not able to be editted.* Why can a moderator not run the post through google translate once it is up to make sure it says nothing nefarious, and then people that come in speaking that language can be directed to that post? The shoddy translation for other languages in this game looks as if it has been run through google translate, so why are you unable to do it for community posts just once? It blows my mind.\n\nMultiple members of the Singularity 6 defense force then decided to tell me that \"moderators are volunteers.\" This has been declared multiple times by community managers that this is not the case. They are paid professional moderators. Even after showing the quote directly from said community manager, members were jumping through hoops to defend this development studio that can supposedly do no wrong. \"Just because they are not professionals does not mean they are paid,\" one stated, when it has been said explicitly, multiple times that being a moderator is a professional, **paid** role. In the middle of this disagreement, a moderator was coming in and reminding everyone \"to please keep it friendly!\" You know what would have instantly settled the conversation? **By telling them that moderation is a paid role.** Rather than just saying that and settling this disagreement like a sensible person, they let the conversation persist, and warn/ban other people saying that moderation was a paid role. Is this a secret?? Are we not supposed to know that? The way Singularity 6 tries to control every narrative and every conversation about their game is truly concerning. I would not be surprised if they find reason to lock this thread.\n\nIt has been shown multiple times in the discord that innocuous arguments and comments are treated more harshly than bigotry and dogwhistles. We have watched transphobic people have their messages removed, but not be banned or muted. How is that cozy? \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15onv0k/about\\_the\\_discordpost\\_was\\_removed\\_revising\\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15onv0k/about_the_discordpost_was_removed_revising_and/)\n\nI have been a member of the community for years, and been very passionate about wanting this game to go in the right direction. The staff at Singularity6 and the moderators in the discord have proven that this game and its community is not what it has been advertised as. It is heartbreaking watching Palia fall even further from grace. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Comment ID jw2cve5 with +97 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-08-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15qc2j1/the_moderation_and_community_on_discord_are/jw2cve5/) (in reply to ID 15qc2j1):\nBecause feedback ✨doesn’t matter✨ and it doesn’t help the ✨game✨ /s\n\n### Comment ID jw2l8gc with +47 score by [(Temporary_Lawyer_938, Reddit, 2023-08-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15qc2j1/the_moderation_and_community_on_discord_are/jw2l8gc/) (in reply to ID jw2cve5):\nThey removed the recently highly upvoted topic about the issues with discord under the \"rule 6-respect the devs\" rule.

There seems to be no criticism allowed. People are still in a honeymoon state with the game it seems and I think alot of people soon will realize, that the game in its current state is still very empty. I try to love the game. I really do. When I first heard of Palia, I was thinking, that this is the game I ll play for years, as it pretty much includes everything I want in a game and then its even an MMO. Or atleast thats how they advertised the game. What concerns me the most, is that the game hasnt really made any progress in the last 2 years according to some alpha and pre alpha players I met on my journey so far. So I wonder how much progress to the game we will see in the future. They already made their money with the kickstarter campaign and I doubt that a purely cosmetic shop will bring in enough revenue for them to not abandon the game in the near future. Whats also sending redflags to me, is how often I read on the discord, that S6 consists of ex Riot, Blizzard and other big player employees. The code of the game is pretty much spaghetti. There is no server side validation on alot of things. In public cheating communities they already found ways to get premium outfits, duplicate items, get unlimited money/renown etc. which clearly should not be possible, if you have a team full of veteran developers from the biggest mmo's in history.\n\n### Comment ID jw49hfv with +9 score by [(RexZShadow, Reddit, 2023-08-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15qc2j1/the_moderation_and_community_on_discord_are/jw49hfv/) (in reply to ID jw3u3tf):\n>They already made their money with the kickstarter campaign\n\nAs fyi they did not do a kickstarter. They are entire funded by investors which probably explain why they are releasing the game unfinished because its bee 5 years and $49 million of the investors money so they probably asking questions. And most likely this was the promised launch date when they did the pitch to the investors.\n\nWell being from Riot and Blizzard means nothing really beside marketing pitch. Its like what were their job at Riot and Blizzard? If they were all junior devs there incharge of small tasks then it means jack shit. How many of them were in lead role making big decision or solving difficult tech issues? There not many of those on a team and those are the people that would matter when you say from Riot or Blizzard.\n\nOne pitfall of huge development teams is everyone get too specialized and that experience is hard to translate to new projects. I know Riot is well know for this where they have so many people and everyone is so specialized on what they do.\n\n## Comment ID jw2kx5g with +43 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-08-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15qc2j1/the_moderation_and_community_on_discord_are/jw2kx5g/) (in reply to ID 15qc2j1):\nMeh let the mods be shills and let S6 ignore the feedback that actually needs reading.\n\nWatch it bite them in the ass down the road.\n\n### Comment ID jw3k379 with +14 score by [(ExNihiloNihiFit, Reddit, 2023-08-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15qc2j1/the_moderation_and_community_on_discord_are/jw3k379/) (in reply to ID jw2kx5g):\nExactly!

Some folks became ill from overwork.\n\nLeadership had and still has very little diversity, which is painfully noticeable in the type of decisions taken.\n\nTeam structuring creates massive silo-ing and strong \"our team vs. yours\" in terms of output.

The company is packed full of very talented ICs who are deprived of the support they need to succeed, and then blamed and take punishment when things don't go the way leadership wants them to. \r\n\r\n\r\n- Dishonesty and deceit is rampant in communication to employees. Never have I seen such a level of dishonest behavior from leadership, especially at such a small company. I can understand a need to be careful on what information to be transparent with, but the leadership very frequently, intentionally, and blatantly lies to everyone at the company about the state of the company. The sad part is that these lies are very shallow and most people see through them, but they serve their short-sighted purpose of keeping the illusion of the \"everything is fine\" dog. One example is telling everyone there will only be a few weeks of \"targeted overtime, not crunch\", knowing full well that it would last indefinitely for many.\r\n\r\n - Diversity problems explicitly ignored by leadership because it's not a \"priority,\" despite the large human impact of them. The company made big promises around D&amp;I to employees, and has failed to live up to them. And recently things have gotten much worse. \r\n\r\nThere are many other problems I did not list here.

Then had a personal disagreement with engineering leadership on topics they know are problematic in the company during a 1:1 and, the very next week, they fired me.\r\nThey also originally hid that it was a firing when they shared with the rest of the company until enough people reached out to me and learned otherwise. Then they edited the Slack message announcing my departure.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, I am not saying leadership failed by firing me. Sometimes firings are the best move (though, I do not personally think that is true in my case, you don't know). I am noting that why it happened, how it happened, and what things occurred and did not occur are all serious concerns for the company going forward.

As we scale, know that this will require delegating that responsibility downward, relying on sub-teams to foster their own unique sub-cultures as inspired derivatives of the original Singularity6's culture. \nIn service of diversifying our team, I think we're finally making some steps in the right direction there - ensuring we're actively seeking a diverse candidate pool and now hiring for mid-level roles where previously we were only looking for senior candidates, but we've built quite an uphill battle for ourselves given the team we have now. We can do better here. I truly believe we could be a shining example of how diverse perspectives bring about the most amazing games.",

While S6 has done a remarkable job, particularly during a pandemic, at staying connected, we struggle with projects that require multiple-team coordination. This challenge is also well known and discussed, making it possible to try to improve things rather than just accepting it as it is. While I enjoy the challenge of helping shape how an organization collaborates, if you're looking for well-defined and stable team responsibilities, S6 may not be right for you. \n* While we talk openly about the challenges of creating a diverse workforce in engineering game dev, we are having a difficult time making progress in this direction. While I believe, given our values and culture of respect, people from underrepresented groups would flourish here, we haven't demonstrated the ability to hire diverse candidates yet. Part of this can be attributed to a very senior staff, which skews both our network and our candidate pool, but we need to do better in this space than we are now. \n* While work-life balance is good, it does require self-discipline to balance your time. This project is really exciting and we have a lot of passionate and engaged people. This enthusiasm is contagious and if you're not experienced at holding yourself accountable to other commitments it can absorb a lot of time. The upside is everyone is aware of this and is thoroughly supportive (like I mentioned above) of your away from work. We're in this for the long run.",

This extends from what it's like to build a game as a developer into what it's like to be a player of our game. \n* We think long term, doing what's important over urgent far more often than even large companies with stable budgets do. Our financial investors in the company make this possible too, keeping our focus on the long-term over short term gains. \n* The work-life balance is good, any extra time I dedicate to work comes from my own passion for the project. I'm actively encouraged by my leaders and peers to take time for family and myself. Taking an afternoon off because you've had a hard week is normalized. We have open PTO as well, which our leaders demonstrate taking time away from work is critical to our long-term success. \n* The game we're building is simply delightful, bringing a much needed warmth and coziness to the industry at a quality bar that makes me intensely proud to support building it.\n* We're building a live service game. We're here to build a relationship with our players that could last a lifetime. For a data practitioner, this means my contributions will be critical to our long term success, connecting developers to the players at-large in ways that can't be achieved with box product launches.",

While I enjoy the challenge of helping shape how an organization collaborates, if you're looking for well-defined and stable team responsibilities, S6 may not be right for you. \n* While we talk openly about the challenges of creating a diverse workforce in engineering game dev, we are having a difficult time making progress in this direction. While I believe, given our values and culture of respect, people from underrepresented groups would flourish here, we haven't demonstrated the ability to hire diverse candidates yet. Part of this can be attributed to a very senior staff, which skews both our network and our candidate pool, but we need to do better in this space than we are now. \n* While work-life balance is good, it does require self-discipline to balance your time. This project is really exciting and we have a lot of passionate and engaged people. This enthusiasm is contagious and if you're not experienced at holding yourself accountable to other commitments it can absorb a lot of time.

This extends from what it's like to build a game as a developer into what it's like to be a player of our game. \n* We think long term, doing what's important over urgent far more often than even large companies with stable budgets do. Our financial investors in the company make this possible too, keeping our focus on the long-term over short term gains. \n* The work-life balance is good, any extra time I dedicate to work comes from my own passion for the project. I'm actively encouraged by my leaders and peers to take time for family and myself. Taking an afternoon off because you've had a hard week is normalized. We have open PTO as well, which our leaders demonstrate taking time away from work is critical to our long-term success. \n* The game we're building is simply delightful, bringing a much needed warmth and coziness to the industry at a quality bar that makes me intensely proud to support building it.\n* We're building a live service game. We're here to build a relationship with our players that could last a lifetime.

Then they edited the Slack message announcing my departure.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, I am not saying leadership failed by firing me. Sometimes firings are the best move (though, I do not personally think that is true in my case, you don't know).

This applies to frontline managers all the way up to top leadership. This is despite parading a feedback culture. ICs who provide feedback have the feedback turned around and weaponized against them in performance reviews or elsewhere. The company is packed full of very talented ICs who are deprived of the support they need to succeed, and then blamed and take punishment when things don't go the way leadership wants them to. \r\n\r\n\r\n- Dishonesty and deceit is rampant in communication to employees. Never have I seen such a level of dishonest behavior from leadership, especially at such a small company. I can understand a need to be careful on what information to be transparent with, but the leadership very frequently, intentionally, and blatantly lies to everyone at the company about the state of the company. The sad part is that these lies are very shallow and most people see through them, but they serve their short-sighted purpose of keeping the illusion of the \"everything is fine\" dog. One example is telling everyone there will only be a few weeks of \"targeted overtime, not crunch\", knowing full well that it would last indefinitely for many.\r\n\r\n - Diversity problems explicitly ignored by leadership because it's not a \"priority,\" despite the large human impact of them. The company made big promises around D&amp;I to employees, and has failed to live up to them. And recently things have gotten much worse. \r\n\r\nThere are many other problems I did not list here.

      "# [Update: Palia studio Singularity 6 confirms 36 workers have been laid off by Danielle Riendeau on 2024-05-16](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-palia-studio-singularity-6-lays-off-36-employees)\nUpdate (05/17/24): Singularity 6 has told Game Developer it has laid off 36 staffers to navigate through a \"tough economic period.\" The studio said it will continue supporting Palia following the job cuts.\n\n\"Unfortunately we have had to restructure and reduce the size of our team as we stay focused on supporting Palia and serving our community long term. We had to let 36 of our colleagues go yesterday, in an effort to navigate this tough economic period,\" reads a statement issued by a company spokesperson.\n\n\"We thank our departing team for all their work; we are committed to providing the best assistance and transition we can. We hope the industry will provide homes for these talented colleagues.\"\n\nOriginal story: According to reporting by Polygon's Nicole Carpenter and Games Radar, Palia studio Singularity 6 has just laid off 36 workers, representing about 40 percent of its staff.\n\nThe news comes after the developer reportedly laid off 49 workers in April, with further staff allegedly leaving after that round as well. There was a smaller layoff last September, with an undisclosed number of developers affected.\n\nSingularity 6 has yet to comment on the layoff, though developers impacted have already started to speak out online via Linkedin. We've reached out to Singularity 6 for further information, and will update the story accordingly.\n\nPalia, which launched on Steam earlier this March, is currently Singularity 6's flagship title. The game is pitched as a \"cozy world made for you,\" with some obvious aesthetic similarities and gameplay features to the likes of Stardew Valley and the Animal Crossing series. It's currently free to play on Steam and Switch.\n\nAccording to a post on the developer's site in mid-March, there was strong interest in the game, including 600,000 playtest sign-ups, but it's difficult to say if that momentum carried far enough beyond launch (just over a week later, on March 25).\n\nSingularity 6 joins a terrible layoff week for the game industry",
      "# [Singularity 6, Daybreak Game Company Cozy Up in Studio Acquisition](https://www.singularity6.com/news/studio-acquisition)\nThe Singularity 6 team has some exciting news to share that is bigger than Kaiju Frogbert (if you can believe that’s even possible!). As of today, we’re adding a new chapter to the S6 lore: Acquisition. Some folks can find reading this chapter to be scary. But it's far from it. Our team is absolutely thrilled to be joining forces with Daybreak Game Company, a subsidiary of Enad Global 7 AB (EG7), known for publishing and supporting some of the world’s most popular and successful online multiplayer franchises, such as EverQuest, H1Z1, The Lord of the Rings Online, and more.\n\nWith Daybreak’s extensive industry experience and pedigree, our studio’s potential for growth can be felt from the Kilima mountains to the shores of Bahari Bay. The acquisition provides us with some incredible resources and support to continue developing Palia and elevate the product to meet the gold standard that our players expect, including engaging new content, impactful social features, and quality-of-life improvements across the board.\n\nWhat makes this partnership even more special comes down to our unique partnership with Daybreak. It is incredibly exciting to find like-minded partners who share in our commitment to investing in our products and players for the long-term, and have a proven track record of building gaming communities that last for decades. While S6 will continue operating independently under the leadership of our Co-Founders Anthony Leung and Aidan Karabaich, the studio will receive invaluable support from Daybreak’s senior management, including CEO Ji Ham. It is safe to say that our studio’s vision and creative direction will remain intact as we continue developing experiences that forge alternate worlds that deepen players’ lives.\n\nSingularity 6 is buzzing with excitement, energy, and fresh ideas. This acquisition is not just a milestone; it’s a launchpad that will help drive the success of our studio, our marquee product Palia, and our future projects. With the expanded resources, we’ll continue investing in the development and exploration of new and innovative ideas in the online multiplayer cozy community sim genre, bringing Palia to its 1.0 launch, and ultimately getting Palia into the hands of every gamer that wants to play across all major platforms.\n\nStay tuned for more updates and prepare for an incredible journey as Singularity 6 and Daybreak continue collaborating to make Palia the coziest and most enjoyable online multiplayer game possible.",
      "# [Dev Blog: Looking Ahead](https://palia.com/news/dev-blog-looking-ahead)\nHowdy, Palians! We love that you all are enjoying your adventures in the whimsical world of Palia while taking the time to provide us with excellent and essential feedback. We’ve been busy behind the scenes, and it’s high time for us to give you all a sneak peek at what we’ve been working on!\n\nLet’s Get Creative\n\nSince debuting Home Tours in the Summer Serenade update, we’ve learned a few things:\n\nThe Palian community is incredibly talented and creative (although we already knew that!).\n\nMany of the community’s creations put our development team’s designs to shame, especially our Chief Chapaa Officer.\n\nPlayers love visiting new homes! Palians embarked on more than 1 million tours within the first 24 hours of the Home Tours feature’s launch!\n\nThese points confirm that your creativity is as important to you as it is to us! And we want to foster that creative spirit by making decorating, designing, and showcasing your home plot as seamless and fun as possible.\n\nWe’ve seen some useful feedback around Home Tour discoverability, and we’re working on a ‘featuring’ system that will place your home plot front and center to help your friends and other players find your awesome designs.\n\nThe team is also working incredibly hard to raise your plot's overall decor limits. However, there are some tough engineering challenges related to performance and stability; and we need to ensure that we’re delivering the best gameplay experience for all Palians.\n\nIf performance limitations weren’t an issue, we would place no limit on the number of decor assets you could place on your home plot. Unfortunately, we need some more time to consider bandwidth and optimize our gameplay that will give players even more creative freedom. Alas, while the current (and future!) decor limits are in place to ensure stability, the team is dedicating a whole lot of effort into reducing points of friction between the home plot and your creativity. We’ve been working hard to further improve performance as players maximize our 3,000 object/decor limit.\n\nWe’re making some meaningful changes that give Palians more crafting and design choices. Please read below for a brief overview:\n\nWe’ve created a new optimization system for decor, such as Building Blocks, that allows us to remove the individual Building Block limit. Now Building Blocks are inclusive of the overall 3,000 limit!\n\nSome other optimizations have allowed us to increase the limit for Flowers from 500 to a total of 1,000! So if you have a particularly green thumb and want to maximize your Flower placements, you will be able to host a total of 1,000 Flowers on your designed plot!\n\nWe’re making the decor limits visible in placement mode and from the housing menu to help you keep track of how close to the limit you are.\n\nPatch 0.183: Sunset Soiree\n\nSince we’re delivering all the dang spoilers, we might as well shed some light on planned content for the upcoming Sunset Soiree update (Patch 0.183). In addition to our home plot sub-limit changes, we’re including a much-requested quality-of-life feature that gives players the ability to seamlessly search for specific items in the player’s workbench and storage!\n\nWe’re also debuting Potato Pods! What are Potato Pods, and how do you get them? We’re planning an entire line of these sweet, tuber-ular, and spud-tacular collectable plushies. There will be a significant number of Potato Pods to collect, and you’ll have the opportunity to get a random Potato Pod periodically 🤫, adding an element of surprise to your collection.\n\nBut the best way to ensure you complete your collection will be to trade with your friends. That’s right – a trading system is planned for a future update (not currently planned for Patch 0.183), and the system will not be exclusive to Potato Pods! Stay tuned for more deets.\n\nAn Outfit for Every Member of the Pack\n\nAnd we’ve heard that many of you Palians would like to see more masculine-presenting outfits. You’ll go feral when we debut the Wild Howl outfit! Although, the outfit looks great on feminine–presenting body types as well, so no need to feel left out of the pack.\n\nIntroducing Elderwood\n\nOur well-known best kept secret is the development of our next Adventure Zone, Elderwood. Elderwood is an expansive, gorgeous, and potentially somewhat devious new zone set in the world of Palia that will challenge player’s conceptions of Flow, the Majiri, and the role humans play in the whimsical world of Palia. Elderwood will introduce new mainline quests, gameplay elements, and many hours of adventure for you and your friends to enjoy! While we’re incredibly excited about the possibilities for Elderwood, we don’t want to give away too much right now. In the meantime, check out some concept art below:\n\nAnd if you’re as excited as we are – we know that you’ll want to get in and explore Elderwood as soon as possible. But we’ll all need to wait a little bit longer, as we expect to ship Elderwood in early 2025.\n\nHowever, you all can expect several gameplay updates between now and Elderwood’s launch. These updates will focus on new gameplay features, in-game events (Maji Market?? 👀), experimental content, quality-of-life improvements, and… new quests! Our team is making it a priority to deliver as many new quests as we can that will appeal to both new players and stalwart Palians.\n\nWe know that you all want more gameplay content and new quests (especially as part of Palia’s evolving world story). And that content is coming! But of course, all new content will vary in size, especially as we continue building towards larger gameplay beats. A lot of thought and effort goes into each individual patch, especially the larger updates; and we want to make each update as meaningful and impactful as possible for the Palian community. Rest assured that we’re building towards these larger beats, such as the series of areas planned for Elderwood’s rollout. Stay tuned for a whole lot more!\n\nAs we continue expanding the world of Palia, you can expect to see a mix of content updates large and small… including the highly-anticipated conclusion to Palia’s Prologue quest. We’re also prioritizing bug fixes, feature improvements, and the overall questline player experience. Our goal is to make the best version of Palia we possibly can with each gameplay addition, new quest, quality-of-life improvement, or mechanical tweak as we ramp up toward the launch of Elderwood and beyond. In short – there will always be something new to discover.\n\nThank you for being a part of the Palia community. We appreciate your continued feedback and support as we continue shaping the game’s future. In the meantime, we’ll see you in-game.\n\nThank you,\n\nSingularity 6",
      "# [Patch Notes 0.184: Autumn Awakening Update](https://www.palia.com/news/patch-184)\nAt a Glance\n\nThe autumn season awakens in Palia, ushering in the return of the beloved Maji Market, fall foliage, Halloween store, and more!\n\nThe familiar sights, sounds, and smells of the Maji Market returns to the celebrated Kilima Village Fairgrounds! 📨🎪\n\nThe night market’s return brings new quests, minigames, plushes, and more to explore! 🎈🧸\n\nFall foliage in Kilima Village and the re-opening of the Halloween store signals Palia’s autumn awakening! 🍂🎃\n\nMore Potato Pod log-in rewards to add to your collection! 🥔🥔\n\nThe Premium Store is stocked with new outfits, wicked-awesome Halloween-themed Tool Skins, pets, and a glider; and introduces a new cosmetic offering: Masks! ⚔️🎭\n\n…and more!\n\nTable of Contents\n\nNew Features & Updates\n\nThe Maji Market Returns\n\nGood news, Palians! The beloved Maji Market makes its grand return to the Kilima Village Fairgrounds, bringing with it all the excitement, enchantment, and mouth-watering treats you all know and love!\n\nWhether you’re a seasoned adventurer or new to the world of Palia, Maji Market offers a chance to connect with your friends and villagers within the bustling night market like never before.\n\nYou’ll showcase your skills in various minigames, immerse yourself in vibrant Palian culture, fill your stamp card to the brim, sample all the merchant goodies on offer, and take in the whimsical atmosphere that only this magical event can provide.\n\nKeep a lookout for your invitation in the mail! And while Maji Market remains only open between the Palian hours of 6 p.m. to 3 a.m; you’ll have a lot more time to complete all that Maji Market has to offer. The villagers had so much fun during the last Maji Market, they’ve decided to bring it back on a regular basis! You can expect to visit the night market for one week every month moving forward! 🎆\n\nDuring this patch, Maji Market will be running for a week, starting immediately. It will then return for a week starting on Tuesday, Oct. 8, and come back every four weeks. To preview what that looks like, these are the weeks Maji Market will be active.\n\nStarts Sept. 24 at 12am PT - Ends Sept. 30 at 11:59pm PT\n\nStarts Oct. 8 at 12am PT - Ends Oct. 14 at 11:59pm PT\n\nStarts Nov. 5 at 12am PT - Ends Nov. 11 at 11:59pm PT\n\nStarts Dec. 3 at 12am PT - Ends Dec. 9 at 11:59pm PT\n\nContinuing every 4 weeks\n\nBrand New Maji Market Quests, Games, and More\n\nThe new and improved Maji Market mixes the classic 🎪fare🎪 that players know and love with brand new minigames, quests, and collectables.\n\nThe familiar night market minigame Chapaa Chase is a Maji Market staple, and players can again expect to hustle and heave as many chapaas as they can.\n\nStamp Cards are also returning alongside all of the merchants, vendors, and kiosks to spend your hard-earned tickets and earn accomplishments. While progress from the last Maji Market will not carry over, your Stamp Card progress, collection, and accomplishments will carry over month-to-month! So if Maji Market wraps before you complete an achievement, you can pick up right where you left off in the next month’s night market.\n\nAnd while we don’t want to give too much away, event-goers can look forward to several new activities, quests, and collectables.\n\nNew and returning Maji Market attendees will test their reflexes in Pop-A-Chapaa, where players can work together to earn tickets! Every night at 8 p.m. Palia time, balloons will release from the water around the dock, and you and your friends can team-up to blast the balloons out of the sky. Everyone that participates will earn tickets; and the more collective balloons popped, the more tickets earned! And like Hassian always says (probably), “you miss 100 percent of the shots you don’t take.” So don’t worry about letting loose [your arrows]. Everyone that participates has infinite arrows and bow durability during the game.\n\nPer usual, Zeki has set up shop and brings a whole new attraction to the night market: Zeki’s Claw Machine. Players that spend tickets within the market have a chance to earn a Claw Machine Token. The more tickets you spend on an item, the better chance you’ll have to earn a token. But items that cost 6,000 tickets or more are guaranteed to come with a token. Toss a token in Zeki’s Claw Machine for a chance to win one of six Li’l Plushes (not a typo, hehe).\n\nAdditionally, players can expect many more attractions to keep them coming back, including:\n\nMaji Market Exclusive Miniquests: Complete more than 8 new miniquests exclusive to the Maji Market that will have you coming back to the market for weeks on end.\n\nMaji Market Exclusive Nameplate: Save up some tickets and purchase the Maji Market exclusive Nameplate from the Chapaa Tchotchkes popup.\n\nNight Market Photo Ops: Influence your friends and party-up to snap some pics at all the best photo op locations… you might find a totally normal Human Standee… minding its own business… probably doing big business…\n\nChapaa Popsicle Emote: No chapaas were licked in the making of this emote. Equip the new Chapaa Popsicle emote from your Collections menu today!\n\nDrums, Please!: March to the beat of your own drum and re-discover an explosive surprise. 🎆\n\nMarket Discovery: Those that know where to look might stumble upon a few surprises – but make sure to keep that knowledge close to the chest! 🤫\n\nPalia’s Autumn Awakening\n\nFall is in full swing in Palia and we have the foliage to prove it! Take a break from the hustle and bustle of the adventurer’s life and snap some photos with friends at the many leaf piles scattered around Kilima Village before the season changes again later in late November. And the most eagle-eyed players might notice the trees have begun to change color!\n\nBut most importantly, the Spooky Moon Shop is back! Everyone’s favorite haunt can be found behind Zeki’s store if you’re in the market for scary-good deals. Purchasable items include:\n\nSpooky Pumpkin\n\nSpooky Jaak-O-Lantern\n\nSpooky Sernuk-O-Lantern\n\nSpooky Candles\n\nSpooky Floating Candle\n\nSpooky Pumpkin Stack\n\nSpooky Vined Pumpkin\n\nSpooky Pumpkin Wallpaper\n\nSpooky Fall Leaves*\n\nSpooky Leaf Pile*\n\n*These items were originally released as part of last year’s Winterlights Shop, but we felt they would be more at home in the Spooky Moon Shop.\n\nPotato Pod Log-in Rewards\n\nThe next batch of Potato Pod log-in rewards have arrived! These tube-ular collectables are a grounded addition for any Palian home!\n\nAs always, the only way to receive a Potato Pod is to log-in during the specified timeframe. You’ll need to log-in at least once between 10 a.m. PT on Wednesday, Sept. 25 and 10 a.m. PT on Tuesday, Oct. 8; and then again between 10 a.m. PT on Wednesday, Oct. 9 and 10 a.m. PT on Monday, Oct. 21.\n\nYou’ll receive one Potato Pod for each log-in reward period for an opportunity to earn a total of two Potato Pods for the duration of the Autumn Awakening update.\n\nWe’ll be giving plenty of more Potato Pods with each new update (including Twitch Drops!) , and you’ll want to stock up ahead of our trading system’s debut so you can complete your collection! 🥔\n\nImprovements & Adjustments\n\nQuests will now prioritize Non-Star Quality Items\n\nWhen players have both Star Quality and Non-Star Quality items in their inventory when turning in a quest, Villagers will default to the Non-Star Quality items.\n\nHome Tour Tier 4 Nameplate reaction adjustments\n\nThe number of Home Tour reactions required to earn the Tier 4 Nameplate has been reduced from 1,000 to 500.\n\nPremium Store Updates\n\nTwo new outfits have been added to the Premium Store, available immediately.\n\nBundle Name Outfit Names Pieces Price (Per Outfit/Bundle) Ancient Champion Phoenix Sworn Hat, Top, Bottom 2550 Palia Coins\n\nShowcase your strength and honor and wield your blade in the service of the Phoenix when you don the Ancient Champion outfit. 🤺🐦‍🔥\n\nDedicate yourself to the stars when you become a celestial vassal clad in the Lunar Devotee outfit. 🌕 💫\n\nEquip a more civilized weapon from a more elegant age.\n\nSwing a sword rather than an axe when you purchase the Ancient Champion Tool Skin for 850 Palia Coins.

      "# [Palia studio Singularity 6 is the latest studio to suffer layoffs by Mollie Taylor on 2024-04-05](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/mmo/palia-studio-singularity-6-is-the-latest-studio-to-suffer-layoffs/)\nSingularity 6, the studio behind the cosy MMO Palia, is the latest developer to suffer layoffs. Just under 50 developers, around one third of the company, have been let go according to Polygon reporter Nicole Carpenter.\n\nEnvironmental artist Daphne Fiato tweeted \"Whelp, I've been laid off,\" following up with \"49 people Thanos snapped\". Other Singularity 6 folk joined to reveal they'd also been laid off, including Brian Ernst who tweeted they'd been with the developer for five years. One developer revealed via LinkedIn that they'd been given the news while on vacation, according to MMORPG.com.\n\nSingularity 6 is yet to publicly address the layoffs, with its last Twitter post happening on April 3, one day before they occurred. It's the same situation for the official Palia account.\n\nPalia only just arrived on Steam on March 25, following a stint as an Epic exclusive. The free-to-play MMO has generated some praise for its cosy vibes and its stress-free cycle of farming and building, but it's also been criticised for its slow progression, reliance on timers and limited multiplayer elements. Its development status has also led to some confusion—it's not in early access, and the store page implies a feature-complete game, when in reality it is still in beta. On Steam, it's currently sitting at just over 3,700 user reviews with a \"Mixed\" rating.\n\nThe studio joins a painfully long line of developers to have nixed a portion of its staff this year. Despite only being four months into the year, the number of layoffs are close to reaching last year's count. It was estimated that around 10,500 developers lost their jobs last year, according to the Game Industry Layoffs tracker. The number is already up to around 8000 estimated job losses right now, with more undoubtedly on their way given the volatility of the industry.",

They included at least one environmental artist, an engineer, and other developers woking on Palia.\n\nIn its statement, Singularity 6 described it as a decision intended to \"deliver the highest-quality gameplay service for long-term stability.\"\n\nFollowing Palia’s release on Steam, we evaluated the support needed to deliver the highest-quality gameplay service for long-term stability. We made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce, which impacted around 35 percent of our talented and hardworking team members. We value their contributions and are committed to supporting them throughout this process, including severance, work-placement and career guidance assistance, and retainment of all company-provided development equipment.\n\nThis decision was not made lightly, and comes after careful consideration of our development and business needs to support Palia and its community. We remain committed to delivering passion in imagination, and maintaining the dedication and creativity that our community expects and deserves. We appreciate your understanding and support of our studio and affected team members.\n\nA free-to-play \"massively multiplayer community sim,\" Palia released to early access in October and Nintendo Switch in December. We called it a premise with \"enormous potential,\" but it currently has mixed reviews with an all-time peak of a little over 12,000 players on Steam.

      "# [Enad Global 7 (Owner of Daybreak Games) Acquires Palia Developer Singularity 6 by Omer Altay on 2024-07-02](https://mmos.com/news/enad-global-7-owner-of-daybreak-games-acquires-palia-developer-singularity-6)\nEnad Global 7, the owner of Daybreak Games (think EverQuest, Dungeons & Dragons Online, DC Universe Online, etc), announced today that they acquired Singularity 6, the developer behind the free to play 'cozy' farming simulator Palia. No terms were disclosed, but Enad Global 7 did say they would fund the acquisition with cash on hand, which stood at ~$9m last quarter, which leads me to believe the acquisition was completed at $9m or less.\n\nWhile Palia maintains a respectable playerbase on Steam (averaging a little over 8,000 concurrent players over the last 30 days), the game was not considered a success, as it had a budget of over $40 million. The game's new owner, Enad Global 7, is a small game developer based in Sweden valued at ~$120m.\n\nEnad Global 7 was pleased to announce the acquisition and is optimistic about Palia's prospects:\n\nPalia is just beginning its journey and it is off to an excellent start. Palia was originally released in open beta through S6’s own PC platform in August 2023 and since then has been released on Epic Game Store, Nintendo Switch and Steam. Throughout the open beta, S6 team has continued to deliver expanded gameplay and content, driving increases in player population and engagement. Over 4 million players have come to enjoy the experience in open beta so far and as of the end of June 2024, over 100,000 players have been actively enjoying the game daily. The game’s growth trends are promising with the game reaching peak concurrent user level on Steam with its latest update in June. The game is making great progress towards the completion of version 1.0, with a plan to release across all the major platforms, broadening the distribution and increasing the potential for significant further growth in player base going forward.\n\nFurther Reading: Official Announcement",

      "# [Palia studio Singularity 6 has been slammed with yet another layoff round on 2024-05-16](https://massivelyop.com/2024/05/16/palia-studio-singularity-6-has-been-slammed-with-yet-another-layoff-round/)\nSingularity 6, the studio behind beta cozy MMO Palia, is dealing with yet another round of layoffs this week, following a round back in April.\n\n“Palia developer Singularity 6 is laying off 36 or so people (40% or so?) just over a month after laying off 49 people in April,” Polygon’s Nicole Carpenter reported on Twitter last night. “They had a smaller round of cuts in Sept. 2023, too. Two sources said a bunch of people left after the April layoffs, leaving the staff much smaller.”\n\nOne of those impacted this week is QA analyst Kenneth Polly, who posted on Linkedin, “It’s time again for me to reach out to my network for support as I’ve been affected by today’s layoffs at Singularity6.”\n\nThe April layoffs hit 35% of the team – somewhere in the range of 44 to 49 people, according to our count – and included the marketing director, community lead, engineering director, QA manager, UI art lead, and even an HR manager. That led us to assume the company had sliced around 50 people from its 100-person headcount. Now it’s lost at least 36 more, in addition to however many people left on their own in the last few weeks.\n\nEven before the layoffs, Palia had been the subject of a weird self-inflicted disinformation scandal as S6 resisted labeling the very much beta product accurately on places future customers would see it, like the Steam page. In fact, Palia appears to be doing pretty well on Steam, with nearly 12K concurrent peak (in addition to the early adopters off Steam and on the Switch), but its updates in the last few months have been on the small side.\n\nOur sympathies continue to remain with the staff affected.",

Singularity 6 confirmed that the game is still in open beta, and will continue to have new content and bug fixes going forward.",

Additionally, anyone who connects their Palia account to their Switch will receive three in-game items: a \"forggy bucket,\" \"mushroom glider,\" and \"Leapfroggy outfit.\"\n\nPalia entered an open beta since earlier this year and continues to deliver updates and limited-time events as part of its early access period. No full release date has been announced.",
      "# [Inventory Full: The Daybreak Home For Failing Games Is Delighted To Announce A Grand Re by View my complete profile](http://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2024/07/the-daybreak-home-for-failing-games-is.html)\nThe most unexpected gaming news of the week has to have been the gathering of Palia developer Singularity 6 into the welcoming embrace of Daybreak Games, an enfoldment only made possible, as Wilhelm was at some pains to point out, through the opening of EG7's wallet. Then again, with EG7 arguably in the process of being consumed from the inside by the company it thought had devoured and digested, the point may well be moot.\n\nI think it's safe to assume we won't be seeing a similar parasitic assimilation this time around. The announced intention and best case scenario would appear to be Singularity 6 continuing in the current direction of travel, driving its own bus in the proven manner long established by Standing Stone Games, the ostensibly independent owners and operators of Lord of the Rings Online, while somewhere in the back, Ji Ham calls out course corrections and tells the driver when to pull over for a comfort break.\n\nPalia is one of many - almost certainly too many - cozy crafting titles, development of which seemed to proliferate following the Great Sequestration at the beginning of the 2020s. The popularity of sitting indoors pretending you were walking around doing the kinds of simple, natural, soul-regenerating things that had suddenly became forbidden in real life - things like meeting friends, swapping gifts and romancing strangers - made a disturbing amount of sense in the plague years but it was always going to be a risky proposition when the masks came off and hands got dirty again for real.\n\nPalia had a good head of steam behind it when it went into open beta less than a year ago (Really? That recently? Seems like a lot longer.) but the game as it could be played then turned out to be a lot less compelling than many had hoped or more likely imagined. I spent a few hours trying to like it and didn't make too much progress, either in the game or with my feelings for it.\n\nCuriously, in about the only substantial post I wrote about my brief experience, I went on at some length about the existential difference between playing a game solo with other people around and just plain solo. Online or offline, in other words. That is also what I came here to talk about today.\n\nWhen I heard that Daybreak had taken custody of the failing property, alleged to be teetering somewhere between maintenance mode and utter extinction, my immediate thought was to wonder what the heck they thought they were going to do with it.\n\nOn the surface the acquisition makes sense. Their business, going back through ancestral roots with Sony Online Entertainment, revolves entirely on building, buying or curating MMOs of various kinds and Palia is supposedly an MMO.\n\nIn my admittedly brief time with it, however, my overriding impression was that it neither felt like nor needed to be one and that I wasn't sure I wouldn't prefer it if it wasn't, something about which I was quite conflicted:\n\n\"As I've said many times, I hugely prefer playing online, among others, even when all I do is solo and never talk to anyone. I've said that just knowing a game-world is shared with thousands, even millions of people makes everything I do there feel more meaningful than if I was playing wholly alone, entirely unseen.\"\n\nI'm not sure I feel that way any more. What's more, in ceasing to be convinced of the innate superiority, let alone necessity, of a shared, online existence when it comes to playing games, I may be not so much changing my coat as readjusting it to fit the zeitgeist.\n\nA few years ago, all talk was of Live Service. Everything had to be online, always. From the player's perspective, the idea seemed to be that, once you began playing a game, you'd never have to stop. From the business end, expectations revolved around locking players into an eternal purchasing cycle, mostly involving Seasons, that would mean no-one would ever need to make a new game again.\n\nThat never-ending search for the Forever Game seems to have morphed into a peculiar form of mutually assured destruction, with swarms of players descending on every new hopeful just long enough to strip it bare and spit it out before swirling up and away towards the next. Developers are indeed freed from making new games but only at the expense of desperately trying to pump out new content for the only one they ever did make fast enough to stop the last few customers abandoning them forever.\n\nNow everyone's had the chance to see how Live Service works in practice, it seems the story has changed. Like gamification and the metaverse it's no longer a buzzword, more of a curse. Of late, we've begun to see not just resistance but active push-back. The pressure may finally be starting to generate a response.\n\nA couple of formerly multiple titles that each built a similar momentum to Palia's before most people could play them - Nightingale and Wayfinder - have each removed the requirement for an active internet connection while playing.\n\nAirship Syndicate claimed they were responding to \"a shift in the industry where players are OK paying for a premium title if it means respect for their time and wallets\". Inflexion made it clear they were responding directly to player pressure, saying \"We’ve seen a lot of discussion in recent days around our decision to make Nightingale online-only at our Early Access release. We understand that this can be frustrating...\"\n\nThe upshot in both cases was to take the games offline or at least offer an offline option. Arguably neither was a full MMORPG but another recent title, Islands of Insight self-professedly was and now that, too, will be adding an offline mode in a week or so. Meanwhile, Amazon Games has been tying itself in knots attempting to rebrand New World for console as an \"action RPG\". They aren't atually taking the game offline but you get the feeling they wish they could.\n\nEverything has its day. Maybe even the Internet. Tobold seems to think so and he stopped playing MMORPGs ages ago, perhaps in preparation for the day when it would all fall apart.\n\nI'm not quite ready to settle down in my bunker with a diesel generator, a console and a stack of cartridges just yet but I do think the online honeymoon is probably over. The days when it seemed like magic just to be there, wherever there was, alongside hundreds, even thousands of other people, all doing the same imaginary things in the same imaginary space, are long gone.\n\nNow, when you hear people talking about what it's like being online, they're mainly complaining about how awful it is or reminiscing about how great it used to be. If anyone talks about the \"magic\" you can bet it's the magic of nostalgia. The zeitgeist seems to be in retrograde right now as people rediscover the ownership rights and privacy they thought ten years ago they'd never need to think about again.\n\nI don't think time rolls back that easily. I suspect internet denial will be a niche movement for the rest of my lifetime, at least. Always online though? Live service? I suspect those will slowly go the way of so many other trends that once seemed unstoppable but which now need to be explained to anyone who didn't happen to be around at the time.\n\nPalia, to swing back to where we began, looks to me like the very sort of game that would be well-served by an offline mode. If you google it you'll quickly see I'm not the only one who sees it that way.\n\nDaybreak seems to be one of the companies least likely to facilitate such a change of direction. As SOE they first had a reputation for keeping dead games online and then for mercilessly shutting them down but they've never been in the business of packaging them up for offline play. DBG has mostly concentrated on curating the games it acquired after SOE cut back the deadwood.\n\nThe upside of that downbeat projection is that they've done a pretty good job of it. DBG are MMO specialists and they seem to have the knack of keeping the games at least ticking over to the satisfaction of enough players to keep them commercially viable. If Palia is going to make it, somehow, as an MMO, they've gone to the right place.\n\nThe question remains whether there's really enough demand for a massively multiplayer gardening game or, as Singularity Six prefers to put it, \"A cozy community sim MMO for you and your friends\". If I had to bet, I'd say there may be - but if there is it won't be this one.\n\nStill, at least now the game is under the Daybreak umbrella, it probably means I'll at least be checking in now and again to see how things are going. That'll be one more for the MAU.\n\nAre we still counting those?\n\nI wouldn't have said that a couple of days ago.",
      "# [Early access life sim Palia has become my Stardew-style game of choice by Cass Marshall on 2024-07-17](https://www.polygon.com/2024/7/17/24199912/palia-favorite-cozy-game-mmo)\nI’ve been spending a good amount of my free time lately in early-access life sim Palia. Since its early access launch, I’ve found myself returning to my human’s comfortable home to garden, hunt, and hang out with friends. Palia has become my Stardew Valley-esque chill game of choice.\n\nThe idea of a cozy MMO was a little barebones at the start of the game’s life — but developer Singularity 6 is supporting the title with regular updates, so the concept is much clearer now. I’ve started to not just encourage my friends to play Palia with me, I’ve started making new friends in the game.\n\nAs a rule, I tend to play most games solo unless I have my pals around to join me. After playing a whole smorgasbord of online titles, I’ve learned that most communities are full of rude dudes who will drop some slurs on you for the slightest of infractions. Palia, on the other hand, has a delightful community.\n\nDuring the past few days, I’ve noticed some encounters that warmed my tired, pessimistic heart. A bunch of players were in Kilima Village, jumping in a circle, complimenting each other’s outfits. People call out resource drops and put on fireworks shows as they wait for people to show up and get the special ore or wood. Players will glibly chat about romances and share their favorite villagers in chat. Chefs plan cooking parties, inviting people without well-equipped kitchens or scores of supplies to come on over to their place and make some delicious fare.\n\nAt launch, and for most of the game’s lifespan so far, Palia worked best as a solo player — with only a few exceptions. Cooking, for instance, has always been a social mechanic that worked well. Flow groves — magical trees that spawn at night in Bahari Bay and require multiple players to cut — were a later addition that forced people to work together. But for the bulk of the day, I would be alone — it simply worked best that way. If I had friends online, we’d chat on Discord as we did our own things in-game and occasionally linked up.\n\nOver the last few months, Singularity 6 added some more features to encourage party play, and they’ve done an excellent job at making Palia feel like an actual MMO. The first is a party bonus; now, if I’m rolling around with someone, that gives both of us a chance at double loot. Playing in a party can also earn some special furniture, so I have plenty of reasons to round up a couple of pals before I head out to hunt and forage.\n\nThe second recent addition is the hot pot tables in the Grimalkin underground. At night, I retire from the fields and go to the underbelly of Kilima Village, a black market where the capitalist cat Zeki sells paintings, rugs, and other high-end goods. The underground has tables where players can compete in a simple tile-matching game called hot pot in groups of four. Playing hot pot gives coins, which I can cash in at a prize wheel for furniture, high-end ingredients, gold, and more.\n\nPalia has always excelled at being a cozy game, similar to Stardew Valley, but the multiplayer aspect felt a little perfunctory and unnecessary. Now, it’s worth finding a few buddies. In other games, I might resent this — why do I have to go and play with Randy Rando? But in Palia, I’ve been shocked at how pleasant the experience is. Everyone is incredibly nice. In fact, the harshest in-game interaction I’ve seen was someone griping that people were running past the bugs he was trying to catch and spooking them — hardly a toxic interaction.\n\nThe writing in Palia is also surprisingly good. I recently delved into the Temple of the Roots with my robot boyfriend, only to find him imperiled by an ancient caretaker we found in the facility. With the power of friendship, I was able to free him, and learn more about the mysterious world of Palia in the process. These narrative chapters are a big reason I enjoy the game, but they are infrequently released. The social aspects of Palia, however, are more easily accessible.\n\nAs a tired gamer who has experienced tons of multiplayer environments, I’ve learned to largely keep to myself. Palia, at the start of its early access journey, felt less like a MMO than a solo game that happened to have other people. As Singularity 6 updates the game, the developer has done a great job at making it feel more social. The game has had a rocky development with rounds of lay-offs, but I have hope that the continual updates and polite player base will lead it to eventually flourish.\n\nFor now, I’m enjoying the chill vibes of Palia, and it’s nice to have a new place to make friends. The villagers of Kilima are great, but they can’t compare to the pleasures of playing with other people."
