Within 3 months of the title reveal, more than 600,000 players filled out a survey to playtest the game, outpacing the number of followers of Steam’s most Wishlisted games. An impressive feat for a product still in development (if we don't say so ourselves!), demonstrating a strong desire from players for the type of meaningful online game experience that we're creating.\n\nWe're intentionally building Palia alongside players, as part of the studio’s approach to game development, so that S6 can respond to the community and make improvements at every stage, and over time. Even in the earliest phases of development, the studio cultivated a highly-engaged community that has grown to more than 100,000 Discord members. Additionally, we welcomed nearly 20,000 players across several Alpha tests in 2022 and 2023. In a single Alpha window, players logged more than 167,000 hours in a month, with top players averaging about 200 hours (!!!) of playtime.\n\nOur team is developing Palia to feel welcoming, playful and friendly, which resonated strongly with early adopters looking for a sense of community, acceptance and belonging. By having strong foundations in place for its community from the outset, Singularity 6 has built trust and respect with these early adopters, who continue to help shape the game and have become evangelists for its growing community.\n\nWe look forward to sharing more information about Palia and our amazing community in the future!",
      "# [Singularity 6 is Going Remote Choice](https://www.singularity6.com/news/s6-remote-choice)\nSINGULARITY 6 was just a team of twenty individuals when we moved into our new office in West Los Angeles. It was 2020, and only two weeks later, the pandemic hit in full swing. We made the call to work remotely, and shared our experience in a previous blog post.\n\nSince then, we’ve announced our first game, successfully ran a number of testing phases, and grew to a company of over 135 people—all while supporting a remote work policy.\n\nBut one big question remained: What was our plan for returning to the office?\n\nWe’re happy to announce that S6 is going Remote Choice!\n\nWhat Remote Choice Means\n\nRemote Choice means we’re championing for our team to decide what’s best for them. They can choose to work remotely, return to our office, or somewhere in-between with a hybrid setup. Save for certain essential roles that require being onsite, this option will be available to our employees indefinitely. At the end of the day, we’re advocating for different needs, preferences, and circumstances of our Sixers, which is why we emphasize the word “choice.”\n\nAlong with the option to work at our LA-based office (and another we’re planning on opening in Orange County, CA), Sixers can choose to work remotely so long as they’re based in the following approved locations:\n\nUnited States\n\nCalifornia, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Michigan, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington\n\nCanada\n\nQuebec\n\nOf course, even with our employees spread across the continent, we’re still making an effort to bring Sixers together. We still want those casual chats and moments of joy that great ideas can come from, so office onsites, local team meet-ups, and digital events are in the works as we move forward.\n\nAnd Yes, We’re Still Hiring\n\nHere at S6, we believe online games can foster meaningful and memorable experiences. Palia will be our first attempt at realizing that vision, and development for it is heavily underway.\n\nTake a look at our careers page for our current job openings, or keep an eye out for future postings as we prepare for launch.

      "# [Sixer Game Night 2024: A Night of Neon, Nostalgia, And Non](https://singularity6.com/news/sixer-game-night-2024)\nLast week, the Palian moons aligned for Sixers who participated in Sixer Game Night, an epic soirée where Singularity 6 stormed arcades in LA, Seattle, Chicago, and Las Vegas. The vibe was electric as the team gathered to celebrate our love for games, both digital and analog.\n\nThe festivities kicked off with a culinary homage to our childhood favorites. The menu was a mouthwatering spread of comfort food classics: pigs-in-a-blankey, chicken tendies, yummy sliders, mountains of crispy truffle fries, and fruit to stave off scurvy (Arrr!). And what's a Game Night without a few libations to toast our collective camaraderie of creativity?\n\nIt wouldn’t be a Sixer celebration without a lil’ Karaoke; that age-old tradition of belting out tunes with the confidence of Vanilla Ice (regardless of actual singing ability, of course). Several Sixers grabbed (and dropped!) the mic, belting out ballads known and niche. Several smart watches warned against heightened decibel levels. But “In The End,” “I Want It That Way.”\n\nOf course, Singularity 6 is a video game studio, and it’s the arcade where Sixers truly shined. The simulated dance battles were fierce, with team members stepping, hopping, and jumping in a mesmerizing dance of rhythm and coordination-ish. And the kart races were a sight to behold, with friendly rivalries emerging as racers chucked red, green, and blue (!!!) shells across the track for several photo-finish victories (to most folks’ chagrin). A surprise fishing game left us ‘reeling’ after reeling-in some outrageously-sized Tuna. And let's not forget the claw machine – a test of patience and precision as Sixers collected an army of ducks that now embellish several studio workspaces.\n\nBut beyond the games, the laughter, and the sheer joy of human connection; Sixer Game Night was a reflection of what makes Singularity 6 so special. It's the people – our team – who bring their passion, creativity, and enthusiasm to everything we do, whether it's crafting Palia’s next big feature, or quacking about their latest toy waterfowl.\n\nAs the night wound down and we said our goodbyes, it was clear that Game Night wasn't just about playing games. It was about building memories, strengthening bonds, and celebrating the incredible community that is Singularity 6. Here's to many more nights of neon, nostalgia, and nonstop fun.",

      "# [The Software Architecture of Palia](https://www.singularity6.com/news/software-architecture-of-palia)\nSingularity6’s debut game, Palia, is a free-to-play cozy online multiplayer community simulator. A place where players can play alone or with their friends to experience a beautiful and welcoming world which can be explored and personalized.\n\nSocial interaction and a persistent shared world are key features of the game. But these elements are also some of the most challenging to implement, scale, distribute geographically, and operate at minimal operational cost and negative player impact.\n\nPlayers experience the art and soul that our development team has poured into the game, but the infrastructure that makes it all possible behind the scenes is hidden from view. We are proud of what our team has accomplished with Palia, and we want to spotlight the studio’s hard work, including what players don’t experience directly. We also want to share some important lessons learned during our journey; we hope that sharing the lessons learned while developing Palia can be useful to others facing similar challenges.\n\nNow follow us behind the scenes of our Palia development journey!\n\nGame Engine\n\nBuilding an online multiplayer title from scratch benefits from a robust and proven game engine. We made the choice to build Palia using Unreal Engine. Unreal gives us powerful tools to build with out of the box, such as a strong networking and replication library to build social features, a graphics pipeline to build a beautiful world, a powerful physics engine that can simulate complex environments, and so much more. We use Unreal Engine for our game servers as well as our client, which gives players a real-time interactive environment.\n\nEach instance of the game server currently hosts up to 25 players, and we split up each server by what we call a map. These can be permanent fixtures, including our central hub Kilima Village, or even temporary available experiences, such as our Maji Market, which was only available for one month during our Luna New Year in-game event. When players travel between maps in Palia, the game client disconnects from one server and connects to a new one. We will share more details on how this works in our matchmaking service deep dive section.\n\nThis synergistic model is crucial for our team: we can develop most of the logic for Palia inside the engine and deploy to both clients and servers. This allows anyone on the team to test both the game and the game server in editor mode, which has been critical for our development velocity.\n\nSpotlight: memory leakage\n\nUnreal Engine servers are commonly used in “session-based games,” such as Fortnite: games that start and end within a certain amount of time. Memory leakage is not a big concern for session-based games because a new server is spun up for a new match and destroyed when the match ends. Any leaked memory will be cleaned before the next batch of players begin playing.\n\nPalia is a persistent shared-world game and the lifespan of our game servers is variable depending on how players move through the game world. A single game server may remain online and serve players for an entire patch cycle which could be weeks. Memory leakage which is cleaned up regularly for a session-based game can grow and compound, and small leaks might end up consuming two or even four times the amount of Random Access Memory (RAM) proportionally affecting our operational costs.\n\nTo combat this issue, we invested in solutions to help us identify memory leaks, and we spent useful time designing nudges for players to travel between maps as to increase the likelihood that a server would empty out and be shut down.\n\nUnexpectedly and fortunately, increasing geographical distribution helped with this problem: hosting servers near players not only helps with latency (because it reduces the distance that signals need to travel); but also with rotating empty servers because players tend to play at the same times, making it rare that somebody in that region is playing in the middle of the night and increasing the probability of servers to become empty, shut down, and cleaned.\n\nThis screenshot from one of our monitoring dashboards shows the memory usage of a portion of our game servers over a24h period in Feb 2024. The trend of linear memory increase is clearly visible.\n\nServices\n\nThe game client and servers talk to our services for specific actions, such as logging players into the game, loading characters, saving progress, sending chat messages to other players, making purchased outfits are stored in the player’s closet and many more.\n\nWe loosely follow a “microservice” posture, in which we prefer to host many different services specialized on one player feature.\n\nWe use HTTP as the North/South protocol (in and out of the datacenter) while we use gRPC for East/West communication (for services talking to each other inside the datacenter).\n\nWe use Rust exclusively as the programming language for our services and we try to include both integration and load testing as part of the definition of “done” for key services, including matchmaking, player presence and player state persistence which represent the largest percentage of our request load.\n\nOur unit and integration tests are also written in Rust, but we use Locust to support and execute our load tests. Locust load tests are written in Python which is simpler to program. The ability to quickly write and modify load tests was beneficial to us and sped up adoption.\n\nSpotlight: Rust for Microservices\n\nRust is a beloved programming language by many systems programmers because it provides state-of-the-art protection against common software vulnerabilities (buffer overflows and race conditions, for example) without introducing any performance penalties.\n\nRust is also a modern programming language. It is surrounded by a diverse and vibrant community of contributors and a wide range of libraries and tools. Documentation is excellent (especially onboarding tutorials) and the compiler is surely one of the most helpful and user-friendly.\n\nOf course, no programming language is perfect. Rust's posture is heavily focused on correctness, which is generally beneficial, but comes with a significant upfront cost which is visible in our development velocity. Rust makes it very hard to “cut corners” and punt hardening for later. It is a very good quality when something that was supposed to be just a prototype becomes load bearing in production by sheer pressure of business needs, but it makes it hard to move quickly and with agility around shifting requirements (which is a constant in startups and game development).\n\nThe other issue was hiring and onboarding. Rust’s relative youth as a programming language makes it somewhat difficult to hire people that have production experience with the language. Although the language is very popular, few people have used Rust in a professional team setting. Most people who have Rust experience have only used it for personal projects. With this in mind, onboarding took much longer than we expected. We factored 90 days to get engineers up to speed, but it turned out to take at least 6 months for most of the team to get comfortable and confident with the language.\n\nWe are very happy with the performance, latency, scalability, robustness and security of our Rust services. But there are moments when we wonder how much opportunity cost was spent in forcing up-front solidity of every piece of this layer.\n\nWe consider it an advantage for the studio to have managed to amortize those onboarding costs and the maintenance costs of our services is indeed very low, but those thinking of following our footsteps down the Rust path, should be willing to allocate a significant effort to education and onboarding. These costs will likely reduce over time as Rust becomes more popular in production settings, but it’s unclear what that rate will be.\n\nSeveral of our services are interesting and sophisticated enough to merit more attention: player state management and matchmaking.\n\nPlayer State Management\n\nWe consider player state all the information that a game server needs to recreate the most recent game world experienced by the player. The architecture of our game is server-authoritative which means that game servers decide the state of the world and act as referees when game clients report inconsistent data (for example, because of time delay in transmission). We took this route because Palia is a social game so a player cheating or modifying their state could have a negative impact on the experience of other players. The risk of cheating is reduced when it's our system that ultimately controls player state.\n\nThe simplest way to persist state is to wait until a player exits a game server and have the server send this information to the database. Unfortunately, this makes state changes in that server vulnerable to the server itself crashing and losing that data (which is only kept in volatile memory for performance reasons). Instead, several times a second we check for player state changes, and if there are any, that data is immediately queued and sent to the database to be persisted.\n\nSpotlight: data first vs. schema first\n\nA source of contention around player state is the modeling lifecycle: who and what decides what is valid to be stored into such a state? Traditional data-modeling techniques suggest a “schema first” approach: the structure of the data (the schema) is created ahead of time and then only data that conforms to that structure can be saved into the database.\n\nThis has the advantage that the database validates the shape of the data. The disadvantage is that one has to know ahead of time the structure of the data needed… which can be challenging to coordinate across different teams.\n\nTo increase the ease with which game engineers and technical designers could work, we decided on a different model in which the structure of the data would be decided in C++ structs directly within Unreal and then marshaled and persisted in the database as a binary blob (using the Flexbuffer format). The schema is the struct declaration itself and we use Unreal’s runtime type reflection system to export the schema to our database.\n\nThe advantage of this architectural choice is that it enabled game engineers to develop features that required state persistence without the need for constant coordination. The downside is that the data is opaque to the database, which is more expensive to keep uniform and consolidated. This has required us to invest in additional tooling around the player state management system to validate, backup, modify and correct player state when it diverges from the expected structure.\n\nDespite the additional layer of development investment needed to provide hardening on top of what the database normally provides, we believe this architecture has significantly cut down the time required to deliver new features with data persistence, such as our most recent Luna New Year event.\n\nMatchmaking\n\nIn many competitive-style online games, matchmaking is the process of selecting people for a match. For Palia, matchmaking means matching the player with the game server that we believe will give players the best gameplay experience.\n\nThere are several dimensions that we take into consideration during matching:\n\nLocation - how far away the game server is from where the player is currently playing (because closer server means lower latency and lower latency means a more fluid and immersive experience)\n\nFriends - how many of the player’s friends are currently playing on that server (because the more people they know the more meaningful their interaction will be)\n\nPopulation - how many people are playing on that server (because the more people are playing the more alive the world feels)\n\nThe matchmaking system is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing us to add more signals to the matching algorithm over time if we desire.\n\nAnother crucial feature of the matchmaking system is the ability to distinguish “join” requests and “travel” requests. A join request happens when a player starts the game and wants to join. A travel request is a match required by a player leaving one map of the game and traveling to another.\n\nThe ability to distinguish the two allows us to offer priority to “travel” requests when the system is under load and there is high contention. This is because it’s far less disruptive for players to wait a few minutes to join and then wait only a few seconds to travel between maps, than one in which the delays are spread uniformly across all matching requests.\n\nThis screenshot shows a piece of the dashboard we use to monitor queue sizes and the distribution of times it takes for a matchmaking request (join or travel) to be satisfied.\n\nSpotlight: game-aware internal queueing and autoscaling\n\nEvery empty server running in the cloud without a player on it is a waste of money. On the other hand, there might be players who want to play and all of the game servers have their allocated slots filled so they would benefit from an empty server to land in.\n\nMany online games design “login queues” or similar ways to restrict the inbound flow of players and scale up or down the number of servers to meet the demand. Originally, this was our intent as well, but we realized we would benefit from a more sophisticated matchmaking design that could distinguish between joining and traveling. We also realized that the matchmaker had all the information it needed to control the size of the game server fleet.\n\nThis is how we came up with the Admiral: a component of the matchmaking system that oversees the fleet of game servers. The Admiral understands when the current fleet of game servers is insufficient to satisfy the number of players requesting a match and is able to ask the underlying cloud system (specifically Agones) to request the creation of more game server instances. Agones, on the other hand, is responsible for shutting down game servers that have been empty for some time.\n\nThe integration of autoscaling with matchmaking and the separation of concerns between the Admiral (scaling up) and Agones (scaling down) has served us very well and has managed to provide us with shock absorption to the game when things didn’t go as planned. Several times, the elasticity of these queues between maps have saved the team from having to bring down the game entirely to fix issues during misaligned deployments or unforeseen behaviors during load spikes.\n\nThis screenshot shows the view of the game servers fleet from the Admiral. Each line is really two lines: one for the “desired size” and another for the “actual size”. This information is used to tell the cloud orchestrator to spin up more game servers for a particular map type as they are needed by players being matched to servers that don’t yet exist.\n\nData Management\n\nOur architecture of loosely coupled software components wouldn’t be very useful without data flowing between them and being persisted, validated, or aggregated.\n\nDatabases\n\nOne of the most difficult elements of creating a shared perpetual world is constructing the ability for players to influence it (and one another) in a context that feels immediate and consistent. A key factor to provide a positive player experience is the choice of the database architecture.\n\nWe decided to use ScyllaDB as our main data persistence layer. ScyllaDB is a C++ rewrite of Apache Cassandra (originally created at Facebook and, in turn, heavily influenced by Google BigTable and Amazon DynamoDB), a distributed column store.\n\nThe biggest advantage of ScyllaDB for us has been its elastic scalability and its cloud native “design for failure” posture that aligned very well with ours. One significant advantage of ScyllaDB for us is the ability to attach replication strategy to a table but eventual consistency levels to a query. This gives us a lot of flexibility because in some cases we need consistency more than we need speed and we can tune that directly at the query level. This is not possible with traditional relational databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL.\n\nThis functionality is crucial, for example, when dealing with a persistent player state: we want the data to be replicated on multiple computers before we return a response to the game server. This means that both the game server and multiple database nodes have to die (at the very same time!) for that player state update to get lost. As far as we can tell, this has never happened.\n\nWe also use PostgreSQL (hosted for us by AWS) for the catalog of our outfits available for purchase in the game. We used a relational database here because we felt it was better suited for this particular job.\n\nAsynchronous Messaging\n\nAnother important part of the data management layer is the ability of software components to message one another asynchronously.\n\nWe have two of such busses:\n\nThe first for aggregates and collects telemetry for player behavior (which uses Apache Kafka, more on this later) and feeds our analytics and machine learning pipelines.\n\nAnother coordinates software components (for example, the control plane between the fleet auto-scaler and the game servers). This uses EMQX as the broker and MQTT as the protocol.\n\nWhy two? Mostly because they serve different purposes, have different strengths and weaknesses, and are managed by different teams focusing on separate outcomes. There might be value in consolidating things further in the future, but for now this separation is serving us well.\n\nSpotlight: MQTT and Apache ActiveMQ v5 (aka Artemis)\n\nThe use of MQTT as the message bus protocol for our game servers control planes was decided precisely to isolate us from lock-in of a particular broker implementation. In retrospect, this was a weak choice: MQTT is an IoT protocol and we were attracted by the fact that it was designed for devices with small power and low bandwidth. We wanted a solution that would be easy and cheap for the game servers to interact with and didn’t consume a lot of their resources.\n\nUnfortunately, many MQTT brokers simply implemented that protocol on top of their existing native systems. We picked Apache ActiveMQ v5 (aka Artemis) because it was established and it supported v5 of the MQTT protocol (which offered features we needed) but was written and designed before clouds existed and turned out to be incompatible with our preferred “loosely coupled components expected to fail” architectural posture.\n\nArtemis has been the source of much apprehension and tribulation. We ended up having to patch the software to fit our needs. We operated with a forked version in production just to keep it from falling over regularly (the MQTT layer and cross-regional federation layers did not work well together).\n\nWe have since migrated to EMQX which is a more modern MQTT broker, designed from the ground-up with MQTT in mind and we have not looked back.\n\nThe lesson learned here is that even established and battle-tested software might still end up performing poorly when utilized in a different context and with different operational constraints than was originally intended.\n\nData Pipelines\n\nAnother important principle of our software architecture is that we want to be able to observe and monitor how the system is behaving so that we can act on it effectively when behavior deviates from the norm.\n\nWe treat data differently based on whether the decision making that it supports is latency sensitive or not. In fact, we use completely different systems for low-latency decision support (seconds to minutes) vs. high-latency (days or weeks).\n\nSpotlight: player behavior vs. system behavior\n\nIn the past, we separated data based on whether it was about player behavior or software behavior. But we quickly realized that distinction was not very helpful in practice.\n\nFor example, a purchasing event from a player is technically a player behavior and insights gathered from them influence strategic decision making with high-latency (days or weeks). But such a high-latency reaction would be detrimental to both our players and our revenue if we didn’t get notified immediately if the frequency of purchases dropped outside of the normal range of operation.\n\nIt is generally true that data generated from the behavior of players influences decision making in aggregate and with high latency while events generated by the behavior of software systems influences decisions and actions that require quick reaction times. But our ability to route data based on decision making latency needs and not on the semantics of origin has made it easier to reason about data routing decisions, especially when the two pipelines are handled by different teams with different skills, strengths, and goals.\n\nObservability\n\nWe picked Prometheus as the time-series database powering the low-latency data pipeline and alerting. The key advantage here is the “pull” model in which it is Prometheus to “scrape” data from our software components, which makes it a lot simpler to maintain.\n\nWe also use Grafana as our visual dashboarding system querying the data stored in Prometheus along with Loki and Tempo to deal textual logs and tracing the flow of execution across several of our software components.\n\nLastly, we use Sloth to automate the generation of SLOs.\n\nAnalytics\n\nThe high-latency data pipeline revolves around Apache Kafka (managed for us by Confluent) which captures and routes the data as well as Apache Spark (managed for us by Databricks), which we use to aggregate and analyze the data.\n\nWe use Apache Airflow (managed for us by Astronomer) for monitoring and scheduling long-running workflows for data aggregation and analysis. Lastly, we use Tableau to power the visualization of the insights that result from our data analysis.\n\nCloud Infrastructure\n\nAnother development challenge is the “free-to-play” nature of our distribution strategy. This approach made it difficult to predict the amount of players that would play the game, especially around key events, such as platform launches, major updates, and in-game events.\n\nWe decided to be “cloud native” from the start because “elasticity” in supply of computation and bandwidth is a key advantage that cloud providers have over acquiring and maintaining our own server infrastructure; especially for gaming startups (for which capital is constrained) and when deploying across multiple geographical regions.\n\nCloud native for us didn’t simply mean: “run our programs on somebody else’s computer.” Cloud native for us meant designing a software architecture composed of small pieces that are loosely coupled and always expected to fail.\n\nWe call this “designing for failure.” Of course, we never want our systems to fail. However, we believe that resiliency in software systems comes less from preventing failure, and more from providing mitigations to such risks and the ability to restore service as quickly and automatically as possible. We want to design to reduce failure but we always expect it to happen, so when it does happen, our systems would not be surprised by it.\n\nKey components of this strategy were using Kubernetes as our orchestration system, Linkerd as our service mesh, Traefik as our load balancer and Agones to manage our fleet of game servers. We also rely heavily on the “infrastructure as code” principle, using Kustomize to help us keep our configurations DRY and ArgoCD to power continuous deployments.\n\nKubecost helps us measure costs, and we recently swapped from cluster-autoscaler to Karpenter to optimize cluster elasticity and to help pick the best server instances. This change allowed us to save a non-trivial percentage of our cloud costs by automating the selection of instance types to use to run our workloads.\n\nFor provisioning infrastructure we rely on Terraform and Spacelift. We rely on Vault to store secrets without our cloud environments. We also conduct chaos testing using Litmus.\n\nAnd we rely on a few different services for authentication and authorization systems, including FusionAuth for account management, Zendesk for customer support management, Stripe for payment processing, and Vivox for our in-game chat system.\n\nOur only cloud provider is Amazon Web Services which provides us computers, storage, and bandwidth across multiple regions: United States, Germany, and Japan. We also rely on Cloudflare for geo-aware DNS and load balancing as well as DDoS protection.\n\nSpotlight: Nomad vs. Kubernetes\n\nWe had originally chosen Nomad as our orchestration solution, mostly because it was perceived to be conceptually simpler and it was much more compatible with Windows workloads (which we thought we might need for testing purposes).\n\nUnfortunately, Nomad had one very significant problem: the momentum of the development community around it was significantly smaller than around Kubernetes. This had two significant issues for us: a) we had to develop in-house solutions that the community around Kubernetes had already implemented; and b) it was harder to engage the team with a technology that many considered an evolutionary dead-end.\n\nWe made the difficult call to switch our cloud orchestration system by using the argument that our development velocity would significantly improve and our operational risks would be reduced. This turned out to be very much the case and it’s a decision we would happily make again.\n\nBuild Systems\n\nThere are two primary concepts used in the building of Palia and its supporting services: the build platform and the build system. Historically, game studios lumped these two together around the primary continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) component. We borrowed some plays from large-scale build and release systems beyond gaming: using a heavily distributed approach inspired by some of our team members’ experiences in other industries, such as banking.\n\nTo power the build system we use Jenkins, but take care to draw a distinction between the software, and the underlying infrastructure upon which it runs and integrates. While related, these things are best served by intentional, separate configuration management and Infrastructure as Code practices which can quickly become unwieldy and complex if attempting to do so under a monolithic design. The result is a hybrid cloud approach to the build system. We use both an on-prem data center and Amazon Web Services, and one side of the architecture can be maintained without potentially negatively impacting the other.\n\nWe also took the time to redesign the initial version of the build system (Jenkins pipelines) around Unreal Engine’s native tooling, namely, BuildGraph. Doing so required a lot of work up-front as the old method was cobbled together between Jenkins Pipelines and Python scripts, but the declarative nature of BuildGraph tooling has allowed us to increase correctness, reduce build system maintenance, and increase flexibility such that we can build almost every target platform with minimal specific changes for each. A key component of this success was integrating with AutoSDK and creating a “standard library” of sorts in Jenkins to glue it all together.\n\nIn our latest version of the build platform we are able to mostly dynamically scale the number of executors based on demand. The build system can then simply act as a “glue layer” to distribute requested tasks among the available executors as parallel pipeline runs. Further, we’ve incorporated designing for Self-Service by other teams, such that they can “pick and choose” which artifacts they want built via a single interface. We call this the “Prime Pipeline,” which presents a series of configurable parameters and then schedules the running of “Sub-Pipelines” to do the work, passing those parameters as appropriate. This means that via the same Prime Pipeline interface, one Engineer could choose to build only one Platform Client from the library of Clients available, and one Server, getting only those two artifacts; or they could select everything and end up with every Client and Server we currently offer as targets.\n\nSpotlight: Capacity Management in a Hybrid Cloud World\n\nA trade-off we make for this level of granularity and distribution is the initial difficulty in managing capacity. We use several build executors of different types and had to really break-down our pipelines and how each stage would be distributed to the executors both on-prem and in AWS. Then we had to measure a single run of each pipeline to get more accurate numbers to use for calculating instance sizes, costs, expected load, and timings for stage and whole pipeline execution. This cost us a lot of time up-front, and while we are glad we did it, it is yet another piece of operational overhead which must be monitored, reviewed, and adjusted in order to remain reasonably accurate. Changing something as simple as the Node Label of a particular pipeline Stage can have serious impacts to all of the metrics we measure, most notably, build times. Unfortunately, there aren't a whole lot of “drop-in” or “off-the-shelf” solutions for these types of systems, so we have had to track these things manually, and then automate as we go to attempt to reduce the operational burden.\n\nFurthermore, managing two different sets of infrastructure is not for the faint of heart, or those unfamiliar with Hybrid Cloud management. While the patterns may be very similar, the implementation proved to be a lot more work than we anticipated.\n\nFor example, AWS and other cloud service providers make APIs available to interact on a very granular level with their exposed components. On the other end of the spectrum, even the most mature on-prem infrastructure providers rely on their own custom tooling for managing hardware components. This is why projects such as Ansible are in such heavy use in the IT industry, and S6 is no exception here as we prioritize the use of open source tools where possible to ease cognitive load and keep costs low.\n\nThe challenge that made this most difficult was the disparity in experience using this approach on our team members’ time. Some of us come from more of a Platforming background, others from a Tooling background, and still others from primarily a Jenkins Pipeline writing background. This is great for general cross-functionality within the team, but requires careful planning to execute well even among the highest-performing teams.\n\nVersion Control\n\nWe use two different version control systems to manage the development lifecycle of our code: Perforce for the game code, and git (hosted in Bitbucket) for everything else.\n\nUsing different version control systems is clearly suboptimal and not a decision we took lightly: git is generally preferred by backend engineers and is far better supported by modern development environments.\n\nUnfortunately, Perforce is very well integrated in Unreal Engine because that’s what Epic Games uses (the makers of Unreal Engine). Also, git isn’t really designed to work with very large binary files, and a lot of our in-game assets and original sources are giant binary files. Perforce works well in these situations.\n\nEarly on, we tried using git-lfs (large file storage), which is supposed to help with this problem but we gave up when we realized how much effort it would be to retrofit all of the Epic development tools (UnrealGameSync, for example) to work with git.\n\nWe sincerely wish we had a single consolidated version control system and code review workflow, but it is not a trivial exercise.\n\nSpotlight: Consolidated Repos\n\nOne of the issues we faced with git was that it was too easy and convenient to create new repositories, causing a proliferation of them. The biggest issue we faced was the inability to make changes that cross-cut different services at once. This created a lot of production overhead and reduced our ability to consolidate the behavior of services.\n\nWe considered switching to a full “monorepo” but many of us were unfamiliar with it and feared additional complexity and overhead that we had no additional development capacity to support.\n\nThe compromise we reached was a handful of consolidated repos in which many individual git repositories were merged into a single repository and then archived. All the microservices ended up in this single repository, but they could be developed, built, tested and deployed in isolation. This made it much easier to modify code across services (such as version dependencies) as well as simplifying the creation of libraries. This approach facilitated an incremental externalization of common functionality into modules that could be more easily reused across services, reducing copy/paste code duplication and reducing our maintenance costs.\n\nSaaS-y Open Source\n\nOne common theme you might have noticed in our architecture is that we prefer to depend on software that is open source and that we could host ourselves if we wanted/needed to. We also prefer to rely on a SaaS vendor that provides and manages this software for us instead of running it ourselves.\n\nThis offers us several advantages:\n\nWe are not locked into a particular cloud or vendor provider (as we could run the system ourselves if we needed to).\n\nWe can provision systems more quickly (our people don’t need to learn the intricacies of configuring them).\n\nLeverage vendor expertise to fix issues and/or edge cases when we encounter them.\n\nKeeps the vendor prices under control under our threat of shutting down our vendor contract and hosting the system ourselves.\n\nWe deviated from this posture only rarely and when there was no open source alternative that made sense for our business needs. However, we do believe this paradigm worked well for us and provides a way to fund and support further development of these open source projects. This, in turn, lowers our future risks by helping make the development of these open projects more sustainable (as these hosting vendors often employ contributors to the open source projects and continue to fund their contributions for mutually symbiotic benefit).\n\nConclusions\n\nIt’s rare to get access to the source code that makes up video games, so it’s rare to have the opportunity to learn directly from it. Even rarer is a view into the decisions and tradeoffs, the lessons learned, the paths not taken and those taken but with later regret.\n\nWe hope that this deep-dive on the challenges and successes of creating Palia’s software architecture provides some insight and inspiration for others facing similar challenges.\n\nIf you have any questions about Palia’s software architecture and development, or simply if you want to start a conversation feel free to reach out to us at hello@singularity6.com.\n\nSpecial Thanks\n\nThe list of people that contributed to this architecture is very long (see the Palia credits for the full list) and we wouldn’t do it justice to replicate it here.

      "# [Meet Our Environment Artist, Maya](https://www.singularity6.com/news/meet-our-environment-artist-maya)\nAs Sixers, we like to showcase our small, yet mighty team and highlight their amazing abilities. This month, we’re introducing a few of our employees who are hard at work making our dream for a virtual society happen.\n\nMaya Mahalingam\n\nMaya joined S6 last year as our Environment Artist. She has a strong passion for art and was encouraged early on to explore these skills. Check out her work on ArtStation!\n\nGet to know Maya by reading our conversation with Maya below!\n\nHow did you get started in this profession and what drew you to a career as an artist (no pun intended)?\n\nI have been super passionate about art ever since as a kid, and I loved to draw and paint. I was always very sure that I wanted to pursue a creative career and do something different, so I did a Visual communication bachelors to figure out where my interest was. During my childhood, I remember playing a lot of GTA and NES games after school which fueled my curiosity even more. And so, I ended up working as an artist at a mobile game company and I really enjoyed the experience. I kept up to date on trends and looking into tools that are constantly changing in the 3D space and became super interested in VR. So, I came to the US to further my career and expand my knowledge by doing a Game Dev program at Carnegie Mellon. Since then, I've had the opportunity to work with multiple teams across games, VR and AR space for the past few years.\n\nWhen you were younger, how did you discover a passion for art?\n\nWhen I was growing up, I played tennis professionally for a while and art was like my side interest due to lack of time. But I still enjoyed going to art classes a lot. My parents really encouraged me to explore my creativity and I started painting and doodling whenever I could.\n\nWhat excites you most about being an Environment Artist?\n\nWhat I really like about environment art is that I get to translate my real world observations and bring them to life directly. And, the other nice thing about being an environment artist specifically is that I get to touch a lot of topics in the pipeline, be it technical or purely art itself because of the nature of the role. That I think widens my knowledge and interest of continuing to learn and grow. Also, I've found a recent love to write and share the process about my work and here's my last one: https://80.lv/articles/001agt-005cg-crafting-a-mossy-oakwood-forest-in-ue4-at-cgma/. I wish to continue to do more of that through personal work and our game here at S6.\n\nWhat brought you to LA / S6?\n\nIt was a combination of my interest in environment art, and looking to relocate to LA for personal reasons. So S6 was a great opportunity to be able to do both. I wanted to try something new and different after having worked in VR/AR projects, I wanted to work on a project where I could create a vibrant virtual environment that the players could spend hours exploring and having fun.\n\nWhat have you learned about yourself since becoming an artist?\n\nI think over the years I've learnt how much I can push myself to face challenges and try out new things. I've become more comfortable with accepting what I don't know and what I can do to fix that. And, definitely to be a good person, because at the end of day I think that's what counts.\n\nWhat things in life are still a mystery to you?\n\nHaha the question itself is a big mystery to me. Honestly, I see myself as a mystery because I'm still constantly trying to figure out my traits, my interests and where I'm heading towards in life. So, having to learn about myself and finding solutions for the questions in my head has been really interesting so far.\n\nOf the many things you do, which one makes your heart beat the fastest?\n\nArt! I think if you make something that you enjoy and if it’s something that people find fascinating then that's something to work on with pride.\n\nWhat are you currently working on, without giving anything away?\n\nCurrently I'm working on getting the different aspects of environment art as close to the art bible as possible. And, I’m working on getting Houdini engine setup for some procedural modeling integrated into our pipeline for customizable options in game.\n\nWhat is the one thing in life that makes you happiest?\n\nFirst thing that comes to mind is good food, especially dessert! I can literally eat a Tiramisu or a cake any time. If I am not eating a cake then I am probably baking or thinking about one :D\n\nFor aspiring kids who want to be an artist/designer one day, what advice would you give them?\n\nI would say following your passion is what brings the best out of you. Other than that if it has to be specific to becoming an artist, I would say keep yourself updated constantly. Train yourself to be in a position to be super adaptable to whichever tools become the standard. The industry changes constantly, so having a lot of self discipline and motivation I think is very important. And to make some time to work on personal projects cause I think that really helps to shine a light on your interest.",

The community was super friendly, and the core game-play has a little something for everyone (cooking, mining, fishing, npc friendships, ect).\n\nHowever, at some point the people developing the game lost their passion for the project, sold it off, and now it has become nothing but a [i] lifeless money grab. [/i] The regular updates have continued, but every single update for the last year has been \"Look at all these wonderful shiny things you can buy!\" Bugs continue to go unfixed, to the point that entire areas of the map have become no-touch zones unless you want to randomly venture outside the realm of existence. The few free updates that have been released where centered around things that had already been in the game before, such as time-limited events being stripped bare and turned into monthly occurrences.\n\nI gladly spent money on this game once upon a time to support it's development, but as the game continues to stagnate I can't help but wonder where, exactly, that money is going. $25 for a singular outfit is astronomical on it's own, but when you have thousands of players throwing $20-$50 into the game each month, and all you can bother to do is push out more cosmetics/decor, it becomes nothing more than insulting. \n\nIf you're looking for something to occupy you for a weekend or a few days until you can buy a better game, this isn't a bad choice. It's still wonderful and fun to play with your friends. Just don't expect a story-line, as the mainline story is short, empty, and has gone untouched since it's release. Don't expect this to be a game you hang on to and enjoy for months or even years. Most of all, don't throw your money at it in support believing that they'll be able to use it to improve the core game, they abandoned that long ago.",

      "https://steam/76561197999218586": "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-02-27)](https://steam/76561197999218586)\nI'm going to complain, not because I hate the game but because I actually really like it. Making 'My Time at Portia' or 'Stardew Valley' into an MMORPG is a great idea and it's mostly well executed. However...\n\nThe game is needlessly grindy. It takes hundreds or even thousands of hours to do everything it has to offer. It's understandable because this is an MMO and they need to retain players, but I sometimes feel like my time as a player is not being respected. If you need a rare fish you might need hundreds or thousands of fishing attempts before you get it. If you want a plushie you'll be hunting for hours or days or weeks. Everything has a time mechanic, whether it be processing wood, ore, cloth, or farming. You want your crops to grow one stage? Better wait an hour. You want to process this ore? That's 10 minutes per bar. It's all gated behind a wait period. There is plenty to do while you wait, but it feels like an needless limitation to keep you hooked.\n\nSpeaking of needless, it seems like the game is needlessly designed in a way to create regret. You can easily spend your renown upgrading your plot instead of your focus. There's mistakes you can make doing quests that result in a \"bad\" outcome and one-time quest rewards that once consumed are gone forever, but actually can be used for decoration. The process of choosing a name is confusing and once chosen you're stuck with it forever. There's even a precious broken sign in front of your plot that once cut down can never come back, and people keep it as some kind of badge of honor. I'm not sure why the game is designed this way, there's not even a way to delete your character and make a new one without creating a new account. New players who don't have a friend to guide them or do a lot of research on the game will make these mistakes and regret them.\n\nThen there's the in-game cash shop. I think it's mostly okay, in that the items are cosmetic and you don't really need to buy anything to play. However the prices are often a little high and when it comes to buying an outfit that looks good, a plot environment, a pet, and some tool skins you're looking at spending between $50-100 USD. It's possible to wait for sales and use the loyalty program to get a few things cheaper but as this is a social game and you want to look good in front of other people so a lot of players just end up shelling out way too much money.\n\nAlso the technical issues are annoying, we have deer floating in the air, randomly falling while climbing, getting locked talking to NPCs, chat not working, unable to leave quest-specific areas, etc... I've heard the game developer has had a lot of layoffs, and that the game is mostly abandoned and only has a skeleton crew, that's really disappointing. I want this game to ripen not die on the vine.\n\nAs a last mention, I wanted to talk about the \"exploits\". While most of these are fine (animation canceling is sort of a cool skill you can learn), the limitations to building your plot just seem completely unnecessary. Why not let people clip items or build outside their plot? It's not hurting anything and creates unique design opportunities and creativity. \n\nOverall Palia is really fun, it's just plagued with a few problems. I hope this review helps to catalyze the issues of other players and encourages the developers to do the work this game deserves.\n\nIf any new players are still interested in the game even after my complaints, use code f2942929-4f13-4147-ba10-613e55e19b62 when signing up for fruit bowl or something. My moral standing is lying down.\n\nNote: I also wanted to point out that Steam Deck owners can play this game! It runs at 60 FPS and all online capabilities are functional right now. I used Proton Experimental but it might also work on the stable Proton.",

The rest of the updates is about new ways to gather decoration and also bug fixes (The game is still extremly buggy it is also poorely optimized.)\n\nThere are OVER 120 premium outfits for you to buy. This does not include the diffrent colored versions that you can buy seperately. Almost every single outfit will cost you more than 15 Euro. The \"fanciest\" will cost over 30.\nThere are premium skins for your tools you can buy. (around 20 skins? some of them are weird because it's only for half of your tools?)\nThere are over 40 pets you can buy.\nThere are 8 landscapes for your house you can buy.\nThere are around 20 skins for your glider that you can buy.\nYou can buy emotes and reaction stickers.\nOne of their last \"big\" updates was a paid premium \"club\" where you need to log in every day in order to receive the highest possible amount of premium currency.\n\nALL of these things were added since they launched in 2023 but there still was no real story or lore update. They added ONE character who does not get to leave her room and does not walk around outside.\nThey are already recycling their ingame events. IF you want to call a timed window to buy or craft seasonal items an event.\nI like the blackmarket they added but it's really just a place for you to grind a minigame if you want giant plushies (your chance for a plushie bag is 1,5%).\n\nConsidering they are now extremly understaffed I highly doubt this game will ever leave it's Beta state.",

However, the thumbs down at this moment is hopefully to help folks get a slightly bigger picture of what I realized in 14 hours of game play.\r\n\r\nThis game dont get me wrong is good. The bones are here, and the storyline is definately got me excited!\r\n\r\nHowever, I have come to learn that I have finished the story line as it has been written within ~5-8 hours. Im at a *wait for the story to continue*. I was like cool, ive caught up, when should I expect the story line to continue. Sadly, a quick Google search tells me that  been a work in progress for almost a year now, with little insight on when it will progress.\r\n\r\nSo this a friendly warning, This game is GOOD. However, dont join it yet. If you are like me and get sucked up into the storylines of games, the unfinished status, and little improvements are sure to drive you insane. I want to know what happens, I want to know why I exist! While I understand improving relationships with the Palian people are a must to a degree... the idea there is nothing to really shoot for at the moment is not a very big enticement. \r\n\r\nI hope they will improve the game soon with more storyline quests, and not turn out to be a game like Star Stable that has had 10+ years to finish a storyline, and still can't/wont.",

Shitty powerpoint skins from the 2000s for £5-10, that crash the game and their response? \"Dont use them\". The release of \"content\" is so that the rightfully pissed off players have something to pacify them for another month.

      "https://steam/76561198803093141": "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-03-16)](https://steam/76561198803093141)\nI've been playing this game for a few days and I've put almost 30 hours into it, so as per usual, it's time for a review.\n\n!! SPOILERS AHEAD !!\n\n**Things I like about Palia**\n- There isn't really a time limit. Because it runs on IRL time for a lot of things, there are no seasons or specific slots of time where you could potentially miss something because you forgot to look at the clock. Stores are always open and NPCs are always available.\n- The npcs have a lot of life to them. They have relationships with other characters outside of what the player experiences. They have pasts, they have presents, and they have aspirations for the future.\n- The storyline is pretty good, if you're paying attention. You do have to put in the effort to read the hidden tablets and the engravings and whatnot to piece things together - you can also get dialogue from characters that elude to things that have happened. This game does NOT spoon feed you the lore - or anything, really.\n- I personally appreciate the variety of romanceable characters. You have a couple that are older, you have a couple that are younger, you have varying ethnicities and you have a non-organic companion ( I hesitate to call him a robot, he is fully sentient and conscious ).\n- The graphics are really pretty! It's stylized in a way that's charming without being cartoonish. \n- Choosing a body type in the character creation screen DOES NOT equate to gendered pronouns. I know this is nitpicky but I'm always frustrated when I have to pick between an accurate depiction of me, and being comfortable with what the npcs are calling me (I tend to create my character in my likeness, instead of creating a new character like some folks do - no shame either way!).\n\n**Things I do NOT like about Palia**\n- It. Takes. So. Long. To. Do. *Anything.* The game runs off of an irl 24 hour clock (as most mmos do). While in-game days are shorter (I think about 20 minutes or so), mechanics like smithing, wood cutting, smelting, etc. can take upwards of half an hour depending on what tools you have and what you're trying to make. You can only give npcs gifts once per IRL DAY. Romantic gifts are only allowed once per irl *WEEK*. Everything takes a LONG time. You really need to have both time on your hands and a lot of patience to get anywhere.\n- The game is still technically in beta, despite being released, so I'm a little more forgiving about this, but there are a lot of grammar and spelling errors. Sometimes npcs repeat dialogue in a single interaction, sometimes they glitch through the floor, sometimes they just up and disappear for a few minutes and pop up on the other side of the map. There are a lot of minor, quality of life glitches like this throughout the game - however I have yet to find any glaring issues with gameplay and mechanics that would keep you from enjoying the game.\n- Most of the cosmetics are locked behind a paywall - not a huge deal to me, because I don't really care for most extravagant outfits and fxs and whatnot, but if you're looking to really personalize your character, be prepared to spend some money. It's not *cheap* either, you could spend 20 bucks on a single outfit.\n- Very few of the mechanics are explained. While most of them are simple (chop tree, cut wood, make chair) others are less intuitive (interact with npcs, get renown, find local shrine, commune with shrine, spend renown to gain xp bonuses \"focus\", eat food to keep focus, use focus to gain more xp to create more things to interact with more npcs, rinse, repeat). None of these are really explained, you have to hover over icons and text boxes to get more information, or stumble upon something and remember it for later. It's fine if you're used to the fetch-quest type games, but if you're new to this it can be frustrating.\n\n**The low-down**\nI, personally, would not recommend this game unless you are *really* into grinding. If you want to get anywhere in the game you're going to have to lose hours of your day just to get through a single lore quest. There isn't a whole lot to keep you occupied in the meantime.\nIf you're into that, go for it! If you'd rather shave your teeth on a chalkboard than spend an hour smelting stone bricks, maybe play Fields of Mistria instead.",

This game feels somewhat incomplete and like an uglier and slightly different version of World of Warcraft. I didn’t realize how much I wasn’t into the idea of another MMORPG until I tried this game out. I was slogging through the character conversations and dreading seeing yet another quest marker pop up and gathering materials.\n\nThere are long loading screens in this game even on a high-end PC, and they sometimes have wait lists with other players ahead of you, clearly a server limitation. I don't like having to sit there in silence waiting for things to load to get into another zone.\n\nThe UI is hit and miss. The grid-like placement, rotation, stacking and movement options for housing and furniture are great and intuitive. I wish other games had the same decoration and organization system as Palia.\n\nThe character creator was clunky. It’s missing a zoom-in (scroll in/scroll out) option, and I’d have to flip through tabs to get it to zoom in on my character’s face again. Somehow I pressed a button that undid my clothing choices multiple times and I was on edge with my clicks so that I wouldn’t mess things up again. Similar to Hogwarts Legacy, my character looked way prettier and sounded way better in the character creator. I look at her sometimes running around and I think that she is now ugly and her voice turned out very annoying. I don't know how these character creators are not translating accurately to the game itself.\n\nWhen I came into this game as a new player, there were multiple times where quest markers on the map were unclear and NPCs were not located where they were supposed to be according to the quest notes. This led to a lot of frustration and running around and then giving up. Later, I saw there was some sort of a bug that kept NPCs from being where they should have been that was being patched. Not a great first impression. Sometimes quests are not marked on the map and sometimes they are, and I am not sure why.\n\nThere are no mounts in this game, but I kind of feel like there should be because there are large areas to run around. They would also make things look more interesting.\n\nThe premium cash shop has some pretty cosmetics and some really rough looking ones with ugly colors and ragged edges to the designs.\n\nThings feel kind of empty in the starting zone. It's a bunch of brand new players mixed in with players covered in premium cash shop gear and pets. I don't really feel like it's a particularly beautiful land to be in.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't find any of the NPCs that are romanceable to be appealing. They're all just purple people and one robot.\n\nThe thing that really soured me toward this game is that your dialogue choices impact what personality element is chosen for you later on, and at one point I misclicked a dialogue choice and wasn't able to see what I selected and there was no way to go back or to press undo, or to review what I had answered historically, etc. This mysteriously answered and missed conversation that I had with an NPC would not stop haunting me, and apparently if you ask support for your character to be reset, it causes you to lose all your referral rewards and purchased real world cosmetics on your character! So I was stuck with this feeling of messing up, tainting the game for me.\n\nThe fishing system is really impressive. It's well done and enjoyable, unlike some other games which make it really tedious. Bug catching was also cute and fun, with the idea of smoke bombing a bug to stun it and pick it up.\n\nI enjoyed the soil tilling and plant watering mechanics. Walking around your soil patch with your tool and seeing it visibly make changes is very neat.\n\nI didn't enjoy hunting with a bow and arrow. You chase a small sprinting target animal around trying to hit it multiple times while your arrows are wasted.\n\nAs someone who played World of Warcraft for years and then quit because it started feeling like a second job, I am not finding this MMO to be pleasurable enough to continue it. It's not as high quality and attractive as World of Warcraft, and I quit that game.",

Pets, housing landscapes, skin tools, etc, are all locked behind money purchases, with none available (that I am aware of) in game. Granted I haven't played since middle of last year, but every time I come back to reach a patch, it seems like there's maybe one QOL update, and 5 premium shop additions, with the usual bug fixing. \n\nIt's a free game, they have to make money, but at some point the game gets so stale and repetitive that you just zone out. Hell, there hasn't been any additional big open zones since the closed beta! There's many ways to improve upon the gameplay flow to make things more engaging and more exciting, but Palia has gone the route of premium purchases to keep the services afloat. Until they start balancing out giving some simpler rewards to regular players and letting premium players flare up with their shiny outfit, i'm probably going to leave this game on my backburner. \n\ntl;dr It's a free game and has some okay gameplay for 5 hours or so, then gets reptitive.

      "https://steam/76561198398361450": "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-03-28)](https://steam/76561198398361450)\nOh boy, where to begin. First of all, I love parts of the game, but the further you get in the story, the more buggy it is. I've had to restart quests I've already done, received duplicate awards for something I did a long time ago, and don't get me started on the controls (I use a controller on PC). \r\n\r\nSo, first thing I'll say is that at some point in the quests, the game becomes just straight grinding for a while. There's not much happening story-wise, and the things you have to gather for quests are sometimes ridiculous for rewards that are meh. My first weeks and days of playing, I WAS HOOKED. This game was my new hyperfixation, I thought about it at school, work and even in my dreams. It was fun, rewarding because there was constantly something new, and it was fun to just build my house and upgrade my things. But after a while, I would log on, and not have anything to do. I'd go chop some wood, mine some rocks or whatever, every single time. I think that if you play with friends, that's okay, you can still have fun with them. I LOVED exploring the new temples, finding every secret and chests. Oh, the chest. Why? Why can't you sell them? You have so many at the end, and they are too ugle to display, especially if you have 15 of the same sort. Sure, you can give them to Tish, but you have so many that it's stupid and you can't keep up with the one day gift rule. \r\n\r\nThe game is fine, the world is charming, and the characters are mostly (looking at you Kenli) loveable. But mannn is it wasted when the game is so unpolished like it is. Bugs that force me to quit and restart the game, 12 year olds fighting over something stupid in chat, and it's clear that the devs are focusing more on the money side of things by releasing new skins and outfits. Sure, it's nice, and as a cosmetic fan usually i'm on board, but the game gets boring because there aren't that many events and story updates. \r\n\r\nAlso, the control mapping IS HELLA STUPID! Why would you ever think that mapping the B button for the jump is alright? And the building system suuuuuuckkkssss. It counts your player collision as you move things in the overhead house menu, you have to place things individually for paths, and it's impossible to put stuff up on shelves or on top of dressers. Also, very sad that the pets are not really used. It's just for cosmetics. Would love to just pet my companion or something.\r\n\r\nIt seems like the game encourages exploration, but sometimes you do a hard parkour (eg the lighthouse) only to be rewarded with nothing. Nothing at all. You get blocked by invisible walls on a ledge that looks climbable and the vines are HELLA bugged and make you fall most of the time. Also, it's very difficult to notice what is gatherable or interactible. The big trees fool me all the time, because they look EXACTLY like the regular ones (eg the large heartwood trees), sometimes the decorative plants are more vibrant than the actual gatherable ones, and the stone and iron ores are not that different visually wise, especially in certain lighting.\r\n\r\nI did not understand the community? What does it actually do? I haven't ever used it in the how many hours I've played this game. I thought Palia had a way for your friends and you to share a village and build it together, but it looks like that's not the case.\r\n\r\nOverall: Did I enjoy this game? Yes. But as a game dev myself, it's clear this game needs A LOT more polishing, and the build mode is VERY rough. But as this game is still in Beta, I have to give them some slack. But as the game is still in this stage almost 2 years later, it is a bit worrying.\r\n\r\n If you are a casual gamer and only want a cute game with stardew valley esque mecanics and characters, go for it! If you are someone who wants to have a great time with friends, this game is for you! But just know that Palia is not perfect and has a bunch of flaws. If you are planning to beat the game, this is not for you.",

I'm a 38 year old male.  Never thought I would be interested in any of these \"cozy\" games, but here I am, having a great time.  I always played mostly shooters, action adventure, or rpgs here and there.  I was exposed to Stardew for the first time a handful of months ago, and was surprised how much I enjoyed the laid back gameplay, while still enjoying a deep story and plenty of stuff to do.  A buddy of mine mentioned Palia and told me he got hooked on it, so I figured I would give it a shot.  I currently have around 25 hours into it after less than 2 weeks.  It's really nice having a game I can jump into after work to garden, gather materials, knock out a few quests, etc.  There's no pressure, no time limit, no health bar, no competition, no getting mad because some 12 year old sniped me from across the map.  It's just relaxing.  I also like that whether I jump on for 20 minutes or play for hours, I'm still progressing and doing something.  It really is a game you can play at your own pace without any pressure.  Currently, I'm in a party with my buddy that told me about it, my 36 year old brother, and my girlfriend.  All of us have been having a blast managing our plots and doing quests.  When more than one of us is online at the same time, it's fun to jump on discord to chat, gather materials, and help each other upgrade our skills.

If you're looking for a no-danger cozy building sim, then you'll be right at home here. The game is completely free to play and although it does have cosmetic microtransactions, it never nags you to buy anything. Ever. The only thing even remotely close to that is a short \"quest\" to just look at the premium shop. So, with that stuff out of the way, let's talk about the ups and downs of this game.\n\nFirst, the positives. Well, it's a UE game, so expect the visuals to be top-notch... and they are. This game is absolutely beautiful. The scenery is very lovely, the characters are well-made and well-animated. There are numerous concurrent storylines to invest in, and every character falls into a particular archetype or two. Naturally, there are romance options, and the game doesn't care if it's het or not. Tish and Jel in particular have wonderful romance paths. Tish in particular is involved with what is probably the most expansive skill in the game, which is Furniture Making. There's a dizzying array of stuff to craft to build your home, and the skill itself is little more than \"collect stuff, make-stuff-animation\". There's no complex steps to this skill, unlike Cooking... which I will get to later in this review. So once you have the materials, you can just build it in a few seconds on your workbench, then place it in your home. Object placement is very flexible, though it can be a bit glitchy at times. There are other skills to work on, such as Fishing, Bug-Catching, Hunting, and my personal favorite, Foraging. This involves both collecting plants and chopping trees. It's surprisingly relaxing. Farming is another skill worth investing in, and is probably the easiest to level quickly once you have enough soil plots. It's probably also the best way to make money. Once you're making a lot of star-quality produce, your finances will quickly become a non-issue. Another major positive of this game is the item request system. You can request of others to send you a particular item, and others can opt to fulfill the request. This is part of one quest in particular, and doing this a lot earns you Renown, which should be obvious as to what it is. Use Renown to boost your Focus bar, which increases the amount of experience you earn for each skill. Nom food to keep your Focus bar filled. Very solid mechanics there. Oh, and there's a kitty. Zeki is awesome. I swear he didn't force me to say that... but anyway, the last positive bit I will mention here, and it's a major one, is the sound design. The. Sound. Is. Incredible. This may even be a larger shining star than the visuals. The music is absolutely beautiful and is affected by location and time, with some tracks changing instrument sets in real time depending on where you are, such as in the town in Kilima. There's a base track that plays, and it will vary depending on which building you're in. That's such a great technique that not a lot of games utilize. BOTW did this in Hyrule Castle, and I thought it was perfect. Anyway, sound effects are also super important. The game does foley sounds correctly, and you can hone your hunting and bug-catching skills by remembering the various sounds of the critters you're after and keeping an ear out for them (or two ears, really). At no point does the music become intrusive; it's designed to be background music to enhance the cozy feel of the game. Just absolutely brilliant sound design all-around.\n\nOK so... the negatives. Oh man, where do I even start. This game is plagued with problems. I cannot even get into the issues without acknowledging the Sugarfoot in the room, which is the completely broken coldet. This issue is so legendary that I think they keep it broken on purpose as to not disrupt people's expectations. Climbing cliffs in particular is so broken that I'm wondering how this even passed QA. Sure, blame it on the beta status, but it's been like this since the beginning with no sign of ever being addressed. Sometimes, parts of the scenery don't load properly, or colliders don't load properly, leading to all kinds of hilarious nonsense. I once found that I could walk completely through hills and even go totally underwater with no consequences. Sometimes you get trees that you can completely walk through, and although this hasn't happened since I started playing this version, sometimes chopping down trees with Muujin in them will launch you into the sky. That was the most hilarious nonsense ever. I've taken video of it when playing on the Switch version. These collective coldet issues can be a major problem on certain main story quests, where being able to navigate the environment swiftly and accurately are key to success. But anyway, other issues are minor, but some are more important than others. There's a MASSIVE amount of typos in the game. Misspelled words, incorrect punctuation, doubled words, you name it. It seems no one is on staff to proofread or even test. I found one bit in particular where the response option was the text that the character was supposed to say next, preceded by a scripting control code. What a hilarious screwup. Other issues include things such as the game forgetting your run configuration, so you run when you're not holding down the run button, and numerous little glitches when you're editing your home. I once ran into a glitch where I was trying to move something inside of the tent and the entire tent started moving on its own. Plot editing in general is loaded with little glitches like that. There's been times where I try to edit a room's windows and press Up to scroll the view and the edit option goes away and the Esc key does nothing. Seriously broken stuff. However, most of this pales in comparison to the biggest problem the game has so far, which is the fact that the developers rarely take player feedback, or even bug reports, seriously. Oh, and the cosmetics are WAY too expensive. Their business model is completely stupid. People would be more inclined to purchase cosmetics if they brought the prices down considerably. As it stands, expect to pay $20-$30 for most cosmetic items. That's way past the threshold most people are willing to pay. Bring it down to under $10 a pop and way more money would be going into the game, which would allow for more money to pay staff, which would lead to a better game. My only other gripe with this game, and it's kind of minor compared to the other major issues but is still important to me and many others, is the total lack of aesthetics when it comes to your player character. This follows the current-day trend of character amorphism. If you play as a female character, don't expect to see any kind of feminine beauty. Your character will be washboard-flat and you cannot change this. If you play as a male character, don't expect to be physically masculine at all. You're a feminine stick insect and you cannot change this. All of the base outfits lack any kind of cuteness or appeal, and even most of the premium outfits are similarly sterile. This is, as they call it, an \"appeal to the modern audience\", which everyone knows does not actually exist. The only time I see other players even wearing premium cosmetics are when they're among the very few items that actually add some feminine charm to their character. Cuteness and sex appeal sells, people...\n\nOh... and Cooking is a terrible skill. Worse than Fishing. Overcomplicated minigame that only exists to allow for party-type skilling. The interface is awful and unintuitive and the steps don't usually make any sense.\n\nSo all in all, yeah... it's got massive amounts of issues, but it's also got massive amounts of charm. This game has a ridiculous amount of potential, but is being kneecapped by amateur buffoonery and current-day social apologetics. It's absolutely worth playing though, and is easy to get addicted to.",

I would not recommend purchasing anything from the cash shop because it was not that long ago when we couldn't equip many of the cash shop items we had already purchased. This was not cause for alarm on their end. It took them several weeks to fix the issue, and there was never any compensation for the delay for those who had already purchased the items that we could no longer equip.\r\n\r\nWith each new update, they manage to make this game less and less functional. The game has been plagued with game breaking glitches, including but not limited to: broken tool swapping, broken zone swapping, broken group functions, not being able to use your purchased cosmetics for weeks at a time, can't move items on your plot, can't find items that were on your plot but have now vanished into the ground, players falling through the ground on a loop and getting stuck under buildings/terrain that have vanished, etc. Instead of focusing on improving game play by fixing these issues, they just keep adding new features. We can't swap tools to collect resources during actual game play, but now we can emote at each other with colorful stickers! (insert angry Hassian sticker here)\r\n\r\nThey never fail, however, to add new items for purchase in the cash shop. Every single update, without fail, includes more digital stuff to buy. Even during the period of time where none of us could use our tool cosmetics because they were causing people to crash, they still managed to release additional cosmetics... including new tool skins!!!\r\n\r\nThe story is pretty good, the paid cosmetics are super cute, and there is an abundance of cute free to play outfits as well. The cozy piece of this \"cozy game\" fails because of the frustration from the glitches and they have completely lost my trust as far as the cash shop goes. It's not unreasonable to expect to be able to use the things you've paid for, unless you are a character in Palia. I would love to see them fix the issues with this game because it really was great while it lasted but as I said, buyer beware on the cash shop.",

NPC likes or \"weekly wants' change weekly (IRL time every monday) so you have ample time to acquire items to increase your friendships or to progress your budding romances. \n\nMy main qualms are the myriad of lil bugs & glitches: \n\n- Lighting tends to freak out when going from an indoors to outdoors (or vis vers), \n- Some terrain forgets its not supposed to be visible to a small hill becomes the only terrain in your personal plots back area, Going a certain depth into water tells the game to unstuck you with a blackout but if you jump or move out of that depth it freaks out and flashes you,\n- Certain areas either do not have the climbing rule applied to it trapping you in between terrain or in water,\n- Certain areas you should be able to jump but are incapable of traversing for no apparent reason.\n- There is also issues with the fishing indicator as you cast, the way it blinks makes it hard to track how far it has gotten and the speed in which the cast moves doesn't help that.\n- If you upgrade your home by adding a room, if the existing room's wall has items on it they will disappear. You have to leave the game then log in and check your storage.\n- Some loot when dropped by the creature/tree/whatever will become invisible and you have to use your HUD's compass whilst frantically mashing F to find it.\n\n\nYet in spite of all that I find myself hopelessly addicted in my special interest hyper focus way. I can get enough enjoyment in daily minutia & ongoing stories to keep me playing.\n\n\nPlayers from before my time tell me that this used to be a passion project worth following, but that now it just sits there rotting just finding new ways to convince you to spend money. A lot of the issues I have with the game are issues that have persisted for quite a while unfixed, as long as they can continue to make money then it hasn't been worth the newer owners' time.

It's pretty decent. There are quite a few bugs that can get annoying. Seems devs may be focused a bit more on cosmetics than fixing bugs in updates, from what I've seen and heard. \n\nIt's in beta. It will get fixed. Loads of play value here. In-game community has been fantastic. No toxic kids like most games. Everyone just talking maturely and helping one another out, very nice to see in-game.\n\nThe story progresses nicely in the beginning, but within about 3 (irl) days once you get to the Watcher quest, things slow down DRAMATICALLY. My guess is lack of content after the whole Watcher questline, but it's literally like hitting a brick wall. I feel initial gameplay needs to be slowed down quite a bit for the moment as it doesn't take much atm to progress. The longest thing so far is finding a Shepp which involves a lvl 4 friendship which is my last remaining Main Quest (all sides so far completed).\n\n7/10\nFix the bugs continue with content updates and it'll be a 10/10 in no time.

Please bear with me.\n\nI was there for the announcement of Palia. And for the beta. I shared my link, told all my friends, cuz the game idea was amazing to me. I legit could NOT wait to play it. When the beta opened, I worked *really hard* to get my laptop's graphics intel updated, downloaded all the packs, etc. It was a headache, but I was *so sure* it would be more than worth it. After all, the game description had been everything I had wanted in a game.\nWhen we tried the beta, we were disappointed. We understood that this was just beta and were trying to give grace for early game development, but the controls were confusing, it was so laggy (taking FOREVER to load anywhere and kept kicking us), and we didnt feel like we were getting anywhere after hours of play. When we tried the shop for strength to press on? No way. Prices were WAY too high.\nWe ended up putting the game down, and I told myself it would be better when it released on Switch, where the controls would at least be more familiar for me. So I waited again. Eventually, it released, and I was excited to see the improvements.\nBut it wasnt much different. I found it incredibly difficult to feel engaged. I was still disappointed in the character design options, which, while better than a lot of games, was not offering what I wanted for my character look. And the shop was just so bad. To pay for a single outfit in the shop, you have to pay at least $15. That seemed bizarre to me, as I have had experience in Toram Online (another F2P game) and Rune Factory, Story of Seasons, Animal Crossing, and FFXI (non F2P games). Palia doesnt have SO many mechanics that the others do, yet the only way to get cool outfits here is to pay, with ridiculously high prices. Even with the MagiMarket event, we just couldnt find the zeal to play.\nI put the game down again and ended up removing it from storage on Switch (the sheer storage space it took up was utterly unsustainable for me). Something like a year has gone by, idk. I decided to try Steam and see what had changed. I endured the re-updating my laptop graphics (~2 hours), and, boy-- How is it STILL this glitchy and laggy? At least it didnt keep kicking me, but it was still noticeably bad. And the shop hasnt gotten better-- if anything, it's worse. No new free cosmetics (or character customization), no access to free pets, the prices are terrible and even apply to stickers now, the layout was still unintuitive, and I also couldnt find any way to change usernames. At every turn, the game has features locked behind a paywall, and to those arguing that the payable items aren't \"functional\"-- that depends on what you're calling function. There're no combat/pvp aspects in Palia, marketing itself as a chill sim-type game. That means having nice outfits, cute companions, cool land terrains, and stickers/emotes are ALL parts of the core *functions* of the game (literally all related to the very appeal and substance of the game). But I digress. I tried to see the rest of the game by itself, treating the shop like DLC. Yet despite spending 4-5 hours of dedicated play this time, I barely got my house built, not a single relationship moved beyond level 1, I kept having to run all around (which takes FOREVER) for quests just to get one baby step forward, and spent an unreasonable amount of time just waiting on things like wood planks to process. I'll say, some features seem to have improved, and I think a couple of mechanics were added, changed, or streamlined (all good), but a lot less than I would have expected for the time elapsed. There were certainly countless of added shop items. Surely a few more mechanics, maps, or free stuff could have been expected? And Twitch drops kind of feel similar to a paywall. Like, \"Sure, we'll give you a few cute things occasionally, but only if you come promote our socials and add money to us by engaging in our content\". Not that they're the only ones who do this, but it becomes more apparent with the rest of the frustrations. \nBefore anyone mistakes me as a hater: The concept is great. They have several clever ideas, and I enjoy the aesthetic vibes. As much as the sim-ish look and over-the-top expressions bother me, the devs did seem to have put a lot of effort into personality, story, and design for each NPC. I sincerely applaud that. I get what people mean when they say, \"It's F2P, so just buy a couple of outfits from the shop and consider it the payment for the game to support the devs\". But the prices are so high, and the rest of the gameplay so weak and so slow. If I attempted to purchase enough outfits to make me content with a purely aesthetic game and counted it as the adjustable cost for the game, I would feel as though I had purchased a half-finished game. This isn't beta anymore. It shouldnt be this bugged or laggy, and it shouldnt be so slow and grindy. I like that it has room to grow, but there are some lessons Palia can learn from similar games like Sky CotL. Like it or not, the cosmetics are a large portion of appeal to an rpg-- that's why so much attention is put on them. Sky is a similarly story-driven sim-type F2P game, and it doesnt have all the npc interactions or farming-sim (though they did recently add customizable housing). The beauty, story, music, character design, and co-op gameplay make Sky highly appealing to so many people. Recently, their biggest issue has been varying currencies that have lessened the chill aspect and made it feel too grindy, losing a lot of people (even I barely play now) while also raising prices and feeding off FOMO to drain their audience. Toram is amazing for F2P, and it's brought me to literal tears over their gacha odds, losing me in the process. But they have so much more going on than Palia. And there are SO many free cosmetics, not just gacha, dyeable and adjustable. And Niki's Dressup similarly does a gacha thing, though the scarcity of resource and grind of gameplay was what lost me there too. If you're seeing a trend, it's because there is one.\nPlease dont misunderstand me-- I 100%-ed EoW and have ungodly numbers of hours on BotW and TotK. I'm also combing through post-game Hogwarts Legacy for every Merlin Trial, Vault, Quest, etc. I do not mind grind, effort, or time, but the journey should be nearly as enjoyable as the destination, or else the rewards are empty/effort unsustainable. This applies to co-op functions, character customization, payable content-- All of it should be giving the player a sense of enjoyment in the actual play. The grind may be taxing but it's still fun. You may have to cough up some money for some payable content, but it feels worthwhile and not overbearing. You should be able to tell a story with your character design-- that's the whole appeal to custom characters at all. We want it to feel like us or whatever we're trying to be. Whatever we're trying to voice. A game should not feel like work or it ceases to be a game. Games are meant to be fun, uniting, and fulfilling. I wish the gaming industry would not forget this. I know games are still products that must be marketed, but dont forget the value of the product in the effort to make value out of it....\n\nI genuinely WANT to love this game. I still think it has so much untapped potential. My hope is that perhaps the devs will research to find what works that love-of-the-game more so into Palia. I hope that one day I can return again to this game and find the journey to be genuinely fulfilling. I could say that maybe this game just wasn't designed for me, but not only are there numerous functional errors but also so many other voices repeating the same things. I sincerely wish the best for this game.\n\nWishing all the best and much love,\n\n~LilKetsi~\n\nEdit: I am seeing more potential and am powering through. I still wish I could answer neutral, but for now we shall see....",

Only problem I've been having is that weird crash \"pure virtual function called while application is running (GIsRunning == 1). So that's been very frustrating. \r\n\r\nThe game was running fine, and I decided to change my settings down a bit after a few hours of playing. I looked at a recommendation for best running on low spec pc and it said to switch to DirectX 11. After I did that, this crash has been happening almost non stop. I either can't get IN the game past the initial loading screen, or it crashes mid game after a little under an hour. \r\n\r\nSo, I'd say, if you have a low spec pc, be careful with messing with the settings because my game was fine until I did that :( I've done the force run dx11 by going into properties on steam and typing in -dx11 and it helped me get back into the game, but then it just crashed again after 30 minutes :') \r\n\r\nVery fun and enjoyable game otherwise!!!",

I've never experienced serious lag or have had any issues with data not being saved- I've seen negative reviews on that but I personally have never dealt with that. The game is insanely addicting and there's so much you can do and it's all for free. All you have to pay for is cosmetics- which, in my honest opinion, is pretty seriously overpriced. I'm aware that cosmetics are the only way the devs can make money off this game but an outfit being $25 USD is insane, I don't care lol. I want to support the devs and I have spent money in the game, but it is genuinely ridiculous to me. But the base game is free and there isn't any p2w or paywall for more content behavior going on, so I don't really mind that. You can do every single thing the game offers all for free and it's a pretty big game. I'm sure some of the quests may be boring or frustrating for people (me included) but I believe the game offers enough, even if I paid for the game I think I would still find massive enjoyability in it so the fact that it's free is very generous just in my opinion, at least. The villagers are so sweet I love getting to know them, even the ones I don't like right off the bat, I learn more about them over time and it gives me such a good understanding of their character type and the village's general vibe and it's honestly so nice. I highly recommend this game, I've never played something this fun and addictive before. My only real complaint is that the premium shop is overpriced (completely). Again, I know that's how they make their money but damn. Borderline every item (like an outfit) is $20 minimum...I don't think the price points are defendable lol.\r\n\r\nAlso the game mechanics are actually really nice! The fishing minigame is smooth and doesn't require you to hurt your hand clicking which is very nice and pleasant because every other game's fishing minigame requires stuff like that which is obnoxious. Also there's Einar. Best robot.",
      "https://steam/76561198064220567": "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-03-18)](https://steam/76561198064220567)\nSuch a cozy game with a pleasant community. Even in early release I've really enjoyed my time playing. Decorating your own plot feels very similar to Animal Crossing, and you even get to tour other plots to check out what others have done. I happily gave money to this little free to play game, to ensure that the devs can keep improving it!\r\nAll that said there are some rough parts. The controller support is very early stages and I'll have moments where the game does not respond to my controller, though it's largely just been a minor inconvenience. The most obnoxious time is when I'm cooking and I'll chop one or two ingredients then the next one will not recognize my controller and I'll have to switch to mouse. But I've never had an issue with the controller that's hindered me while fishing, hunting or bug-hunting! And speaking of early access, there are bugs in the game play like one of the games not working right during the festival week, which can only be remedied by exiting and re-entering the area, at which point you've already missed half the game.  And sometimes you'll try to enter a new area and the loading screen will spin for a bit then pop you right back where you were, so you have to try again. Mostly annoying if you're trying to get somewhere at a specific time, but never takes more than a single attempt before it response correctly.\r\nBut that said all my complaints can easily be tied to it being early access, and I'm confident that they're working on fixing these bugs!\r\n\r\nWhat others have said about it being grindy are true, and that's not for everyone, but I quite enjoy it. Because in this game there's a reward for the grind, and it never takes to long to get what you're looking for.\r\nUnless you're looking for silk. That's always a slog. \r\n\r\nLooking forward to seeing more of what this game has to offer as it continues improving!",

I feel as though the progression can relate to building a base on Clash of Clans. It can almost feel annoying needing to grind so much to craft furniture and decorate your plot. Some higher tier resources can be very difficult to find. I have played over 100 hours and progress has felt so slow. I go on expeditions to gather resources and will spend an hour in real life gathering them- only to be able to find enough things to craft one piece of furniture. Which I might not even be able to craft since smelting some of the ore can take a couple hours in real life depending on what it is. The cash shop is extremely expensive- an outfit can cost $30-$50 USD and is only cosmetic. It would be cool if pets had unique quirks or abilities but they are also only cosmetic. You play and grind and its a lot of fun but you get to a point where finding resources is so difficult and time consuming that you lose motivation to play. There are also quite of few random bugs which I have never really dealt with before. Buildings going invisible, stairs not necessarily becoming invisible but my character will disappear and then reappear at the bottom. Their is practically no story which is also kind of a bummer. Whatever quest there are feel somewhat repetitive and anti climatic. Building relationships with villagers takes a long time so much so I don't remember the last time i did a quest. The quest will have you running around the whole map which can get pretty annoying as well. After playing for some time if this game had costed anything I dont think I would have bought it knowing what i do now. It was fun- but now things can take multiple hours in real life to complete- similar to clash of clans which has caused me to completely lose motivation.... again fun at first but only if you have A LOT of time to spare to play and grind for resources. I have put 109 hours into this game and am STILL barely making any money from farming apple trees and other resources as well. Not sure if I will keep playing anymore which is a bummer because the concept was there but I am assuming new management? has completely shifted the focus to in game purchases.",

After 20 hours, there's no combat that I've seen other than hunting, and that's pretty basic. The adventuring is pretty basic, and co-op doesn't amount to anything because there's really no combat. You just run around and explore, and that only amounts to a few hours of gameplay. This game is pretty boring.",

A lot of reviews mention bugs, and there definitely are some, but it's not nearly as bad as some people make it sound. It's entirely playable right now, but maybe it wasn't before I started.\n\nIt's very cozy, each villager has their own personality, there are a lot of quests, and it has a pretty decent overarching story. You can do whatever you want and take your time with just about everything. You get benefits from playing with friends, but you don't miss out on anything by playing solo.\n\nThe only thing I'd really like added is more progression. Even just something like 1 more tier of tools and the things to make them would be awesome. The next big update might just do that since there is supposed to be an entirely new area.",

The art-style is great and the level of customization when building your farm & house are exceptional.  The main story is intriguing and some of the mini-games are unique and enjoyable--cooking is great. And when you get to the underground, Hot Pot is addictive and well-worth spending and in-game night on.   It's an MMO, which you rarely see in this genre, but while you are encouraged to team up, you can definitely play solo, if that's your style. \r\n\r\nOnly potential downsides are it does get a bit grindy trying to keep up with all you need to build, but that's to be expected with something you can really put your mark on.  And it does seem to lack any sense of danger, but that's minor at best.  \r\n\r\nOverall, great game.  It has micro-transactions for cosmetic purposes, but it's definitely no pay-to-win.  If this is your type of game, it's a fine addition to your game list.",

Alternative acquisition methods: Introduce quests, trading, or alternative activities to obtain resources.\n8. Streamlining gathering mechanics: Reduce the number of steps involved in gathering certain resources, like silk.\n\nNarrative Development: Enhance the story with\n\n1. More compelling characters: Develop characters with deeper backstories, motivations, and relationships.\n2. Meaningful choices: Introduce choices that impact the story and world in noticeable ways.\n3.

The crafting is fun and doesn't feel like a chore, Palia has common farming sim tasks like foraging, fishing, gardening etc. but I enjoy the way you garden and fish. I personally haven't come across a farming game that feels like Palia. They did a very good job making a primarily farming sim feel different than all the other farming sims out there. AND its free, the only in game purchases are cosmetics which I am much more willing to buy while playing a very well made free game. Well done, I look forward to seeing what the developers do with the game once out of beta!",

I spend more time on Palia than Sims and enjoy every moment. I truly enjoy playing Palia the quest are fun and some are very challenging to the point of having to google them sometimes. I enjoy trying to figure it out before looking it up but after trying to complete a quest over 2 hours real time I look it up. Also, sometimes this game just makes me feel like a complete idiot lol plenty of duh moments maybe it's just me who knows lol I look forward to spending my down time on the game.

I like that it doesn't rush you to get things done in a certain order. You can fish all day and you're not missing out on special events for example. Your farm is there when you get to it, nothing will die. Now that I'm back to work the passive income from seeding potatoes and jarring tomatoes and apples is huge, I came home to a 9k gold output.

Think of Animal Crossing mixed with The Sims! The game is entertaining to play! It's just like playing The Sims, but you have quests, play online, and with other people. The game is \"FREE\" to play. The only money you will spend will be for the costumes, pets, gliders, and different overlays for your tools. They have no real use, they are just aesthetics. Which are hard not to buy. I did buy a few. \n\nThe only issue I have with the game, is with some of the players. Some players like to \"shame\" others for not sharing a resource. They also tend to gang up and \"shame\" players. Obviously, these are the same individuals who think that everyone should get a trophy for participation, even though their team lost! The same people who hide behind their keyboards and bully people. I allowed my little cousin to play with my character and she came crying to me that someone online said mean things to her (she is only 6). Don't say anything to them! STAY CALM! You don't have to share resources, but it is polite to share (only if you want to), it is not a \"RULE.\" Just block them, and if you want to, you can report them for harassment.

If you're a creative person, let me tell you, the sky is the limit (but not really). The game gives you so much creative freedom not just with the way you can decorate but what you can build too! Don't want a cottage? Build a treehouse or even a castle! The community is super friendly and welcoming to new players; never seen a more united community in any MMO before. The only downside thus far is the lack of maps but I'm sure that will change in due time. If you're looking for a super cozy game to ease down your anxiety or relax after a long and stressful day, this is the one.",

The game We Happy Few was about the kind of people who claim to like extremely docile stuff like this. WHF was about people being controlled by drugs and censorship. Expect a lot of that if you make the mistake of trying to be real and have fun in this game. :)\n\nOverall, the game is unplayable in many ways. I focus on the fact that it is a technical mess and overall unappealing.\n\n(The ideological term speak with stuff like \"body type\" and \"type A' and \"type B\" instead of 'man' and 'woman' makes this game unappealing in both fiction and non-fiction universes. Definitely do not let your impressionable kids play games like this one without supervision. Show the right things, not Palia that is some ideologically infested dogma project. )\n\nRuns like a dead donkey in a tar funeral... on ice. 8 GB recommended my donkey - I have that on Win10 and it crashed during the intro cutscene following the character creation first time around. After that it was just a laggy mess.\n\nA fun fact: you cannot disable anti-aliasing in this game - your screen will turn into a black box. Oh joy. It is super unoptimized even though it looks worse than most 20-yo games.\n\nThe loading times are horrendous with a non-SSD game and it wastes much more RAM than it claims to require.\n\nThe user interface feels floaty. There is no polish to it. I could not select axe that I had for some non-explained reason.",

People are generally nice and will readily answer questions if you need some guidance. You can also gather a party together to do all the tasks if you like social stuff.

Most of the game is made of fetching things for villagers and building a nice home. Some people might see this as a fetch quest oriented game. I personally enjoy the quest oriented system, the dialouge is so much fun and there's strong worldbuilding to discover alone or with friends. The friendship system requires real work, tied to actual real world time. (one gift an irl day) this is a good incentive to keep coming back. \r\n\r\nKeeping in mind that this is a Beta, I think the following additions would make the game a ton more enjoyable:\r\n\r\n1) The farming system needs some love. Currently, the extent of farming progression is to unlock better tools and about 3 new crops. The system of crops effecting the growth around them is very unique and fun and i just wish there was more to it and hope that  future updates will provide some sort of rare seeds or cross breeding plants ect ect, really  just anything that means i can grow things not found in easily acessible stores.\r\n\r\n2) I dislike the fact that the fashion system is entirely payment focused on microtransactions. if there wasnt a whole character dedicated  to clothing i wouldn't mind, but it makes me sad that there's nothing for me to craft and learn from with Jel like so many other characters. There are so many quests where you help Jel make an article of clothing but you never get to see or equip anything he makes as far as I know. Buying fancy cosmetics is fine, but community clothing would really up the game, if this isn't possible it would still be great to be able to make clothes with your loom, even if they were simple. if this also isn't possible I think everyone would be happy to buy some in-game currency priced outfits from jel's shop.",

I wish there was more to do with the hunting and mining. I feel like they could really dive deeper into the farming side of the game fore sure. I think the prices for the premium cosmetics is actually insane and the only thing I've bought so far is Zeki's daily login bonus. I was interested in getting the premium cosmetics but it's way too expensive for me. I hope to see them add more and more options to the game. Maybe more areas to explore, more characters to meet.

Characters didn't peak my interest anyway. Tbf I only played 3 hours so maybe it's a good game but every other game like its kind, or games I thought it was like (Sandrock, Stardew, etc. type games) caught me from the get go. This didn't. Also couldn't care less about the online aspect, just annoyed at constantly having to wait in loading screens because \"2 other palians\" are before me or whatever.",

Here are the Pros from what I have seen:\n- Relaxing music & Gameplay\n- Interesting characters and a great art direction\n- Fun fishing mechanics\n- Decent crafting mechanics\n- Good character creation.\n\nIt takes out a lot of the stress of other games of its nature that would make your character crash from exhaustion or give you the ability to soft-lock yourself. While I don't care for the multiplayer, it's cool that you can chat and trade with others. Now for the Cons:\n- Controller Support is clunky\n- Minimap is not great\n- Some tutorial directions are odd with their wording.\n\nBut that's really it?

      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-03-08)](https://steam/76561198194961654)\nInitially I adored this game, it's easy to get in to, the story itself is fun, and there are so many adorable things to collect . The community was super friendly, and the core game-play has a little something for everyone (cooking, mining, fishing, npc friendships, ect).\n\nHowever, at some point the people developing the game lost their passion for the project, sold it off, and now it has become nothing but a [i] lifeless money grab. [/i] The regular updates have continued, but every single update for the last year has been \"Look at all these wonderful shiny things you can buy!\" Bugs continue to go unfixed, to the point that entire areas of the map have become no-touch zones unless you want to randomly venture outside the realm of existence. The few free updates that have been released where centered around things that had already been in the game before, such as time-limited events being stripped bare and turned into monthly occurrences.\n\nI gladly spent money on this game once upon a time to support it's development, but as the game continues to stagnate I can't help but wonder where, exactly, that money is going. $25 for a singular outfit is astronomical on it's own, but when you have thousands of players throwing $20-$50 into the game each month, and all you can bother to do is push out more cosmetics/decor, it becomes nothing more than insulting. \n\nIf you're looking for something to occupy you for a weekend or a few days until you can buy a better game, this isn't a bad choice. It's still wonderful and fun to play with your friends. Just don't expect a story-line, as the mainline story is short, empty, and has gone untouched since it's release. Don't expect this to be a game you hang on to and enjoy for months or even years. Most of all, don't throw your money at it in support believing that they'll be able to use it to improve the core game, they abandoned that long ago.",
      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-03-12)](https://steam/76561198066089794)\nI would like the ability to grind for the in game currency, or more free cosmetics. I understand premium cosmetics, but the actual amount of free ones is lacking.",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-02-27)](https://steam/76561197999218586)\nI'm going to complain, not because I hate the game but because I actually really like it. Making 'My Time at Portia' or 'Stardew Valley' into an MMORPG is a great idea and it's mostly well executed. However...\n\nThe game is needlessly grindy. It takes hundreds or even thousands of hours to do everything it has to offer. It's understandable because this is an MMO and they need to retain players, but I sometimes feel like my time as a player is not being respected. If you need a rare fish you might need hundreds or thousands of fishing attempts before you get it. If you want a plushie you'll be hunting for hours or days or weeks. Everything has a time mechanic, whether it be processing wood, ore, cloth, or farming. You want your crops to grow one stage? Better wait an hour. You want to process this ore? That's 10 minutes per bar. It's all gated behind a wait period. There is plenty to do while you wait, but it feels like an needless limitation to keep you hooked.\n\nSpeaking of needless, it seems like the game is needlessly designed in a way to create regret. You can easily spend your renown upgrading your plot instead of your focus. There's mistakes you can make doing quests that result in a \"bad\" outcome and one-time quest rewards that once consumed are gone forever, but actually can be used for decoration. The process of choosing a name is confusing and once chosen you're stuck with it forever. There's even a precious broken sign in front of your plot that once cut down can never come back, and people keep it as some kind of badge of honor. I'm not sure why the game is designed this way, there's not even a way to delete your character and make a new one without creating a new account. New players who don't have a friend to guide them or do a lot of research on the game will make these mistakes and regret them.\n\nThen there's the in-game cash shop. I think it's mostly okay, in that the items are cosmetic and you don't really need to buy anything to play. However the prices are often a little high and when it comes to buying an outfit that looks good, a plot environment, a pet, and some tool skins you're looking at spending between $50-100 USD. It's possible to wait for sales and use the loyalty program to get a few things cheaper but as this is a social game and you want to look good in front of other people so a lot of players just end up shelling out way too much money.\n\nAlso the technical issues are annoying, we have deer floating in the air, randomly falling while climbing, getting locked talking to NPCs, chat not working, unable to leave quest-specific areas, etc... I've heard the game developer has had a lot of layoffs, and that the game is mostly abandoned and only has a skeleton crew, that's really disappointing. I want this game to ripen not die on the vine.\n\nAs a last mention, I wanted to talk about the \"exploits\". While most of these are fine (animation canceling is sort of a cool skill you can learn), the limitations to building your plot just seem completely unnecessary. Why not let people clip items or build outside their plot? It's not hurting anything and creates unique design opportunities and creativity. \n\nOverall Palia is really fun, it's just plagued with a few problems. I hope this review helps to catalyze the issues of other players and encourages the developers to do the work this game deserves.\n\nIf any new players are still interested in the game even after my complaints, use code f2942929-4f13-4147-ba10-613e55e19b62 when signing up for fruit bowl or something. My moral standing is lying down.\n\nNote: I also wanted to point out that Steam Deck owners can play this game! It runs at 60 FPS and all online capabilities are functional right now. I used Proton Experimental but it might also work on the stable Proton.",
      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-03-22)](https://steam/76561198055276426)\nPalia launched in December 2023 with it's own launcher.\nThe studio behind Palia was acquired by Daybreak in 2024.\nNearly 40% of the staff were laid off. \n\nThe majority of all updates (patches excluded) since they launched now were about getting you to spend your money in their shop, seriously they add new cosmetics for you to buy multiple times a month. The rest of the updates is about new ways to gather decoration and also bug fixes (The game is still extremly buggy it is also poorely optimized.)\n\nThere are OVER 120 premium outfits for you to buy. This does not include the diffrent colored versions that you can buy seperately. Almost every single outfit will cost you more than 15 Euro. The \"fanciest\" will cost over 30.\nThere are premium skins for your tools you can buy. (around 20 skins? some of them are weird because it's only for half of your tools?)\nThere are over 40 pets you can buy.\nThere are 8 landscapes for your house you can buy.\nThere are around 20 skins for your glider that you can buy.\nYou can buy emotes and reaction stickers.\nOne of their last \"big\" updates was a paid premium \"club\" where you need to log in every day in order to receive the highest possible amount of premium currency.\n\nALL of these things were added since they launched in 2023 but there still was no real story or lore update. They added ONE character who does not get to leave her room and does not walk around outside.\nThey are already recycling their ingame events. IF you want to call a timed window to buy or craft seasonal items an event.\nI like the blackmarket they added but it's really just a place for you to grind a minigame if you want giant plushies (your chance for a plushie bag is 1,5%).\n\nConsidering they are now extremly understaffed I highly doubt this game will ever leave it's Beta state.",

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-03-22)](https://steam/76561199551758070)\nThis game is so awesome, all the best survivor-game things, but without fear to lose anything. You get resources, craft things, give presents, enjoy quests, build house of your dream, cook, go fishing and everything is even more fun and interesting with your team-mates. Community in this game is really nice, heart opened and kind, which makes it even more awesome. Thank you for everyone who helps with advises, cook with me and go on our hunts for treasures and magic creatures.

      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-03-19)](https://steam/76561198073204347)\nSo I will come back to this review at some point, as I do intend to keep playing... However, the thumbs down at this moment is hopefully to help folks get a slightly bigger picture of what I realized in 14 hours of game play.\r\n\r\nThis game dont get me wrong is good. The bones are here, and the storyline is definately got me excited!\r\n\r\nHowever, I have come to learn that I have finished the story line as it has been written within ~5-8 hours. Im at a *wait for the story to continue*. I was like cool, ive caught up, when should I expect the story line to continue. Sadly, a quick Google search tells me that  been a work in progress for almost a year now, with little insight on when it will progress.\r\n\r\nSo this a friendly warning, This game is GOOD. However, dont join it yet. If you are like me and get sucked up into the storylines of games, the unfinished status, and little improvements are sure to drive you insane. I want to know what happens, I want to know why I exist! While I understand improving relationships with the Palian people are a must to a degree... the idea there is nothing to really shoot for at the moment is not a very big enticement. \r\n\r\nI hope they will improve the game soon with more storyline quests, and not turn out to be a game like Star Stable that has had 10+ years to finish a storyline, and still can't/wont.",

      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-02-27)](https://steam/76561198862109211)\nThe game itself is alright, nothing amazing or truly groundbreaking. The minigames are more fun than the acc game cycle grind. The issue lies in the devs/publisher, they push out sub-par content mainly PREMIUM COSMETIC SKINS that'll cost an arm and a leg. Tool skins. Shitty powerpoint skins from the 2000s for £5-10, that crash the game and their response? \"Dont use them\". The release of \"content\" is so that the rightfully pissed off players have something to pacify them for another month.  Whilst never actually bug-fixing some of the largest bugs that have been around since day-dot. \n\nTLDR: Palia is meh, S6 are money hungry",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-03-14)](https://steam/76561198010792731)\nhonestly it is a good stress free game. there is no player death, starving just means you don't get bonus exp, the characters you meet are all charming in their own way, majority of players are peaceful and helpful, players working together get more bonuses helping other players, there is little to no con for forgetting to check in on your farms for long periods, the mini games like chapa chasing are a great touch to break from the repetitive resource grinding, decorating your home is satisfying and easy to do,  the hunting is forgiving if your aim is lacking, and best of all ( IT IS FREE TO PLAY ).\r\nThere is no pay to win or getting an edge, the only things that cost money really are the cool cosmetics for your characters, gliders, and pets to make you stand out among your friends. \r\nThe game is currently in beta and for what it is right now, I am hooked and find myself wanting to come to the world of palia to just relax and enjoy myself.

      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-03-25)](https://steam/76561198013119250)\nSadly, despite I sunk 20 hours into this game I've to leave negative. Why? Reason is simple, game in the mid-endgame forces you to look for resources that you can't get just by playing. You need other player to help you and such resources are quite rare, so it's like hoping that someone else will find you nearby and help you with it. Another and main reason is how developers are \"making this game\" - only some decors, only some fixes and...\n\n[b][h1]HUGE[/h1][/b]\n\nUpdate for premium shop.

      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-03-16)](https://steam/76561198803093141)\nI've been playing this game for a few days and I've put almost 30 hours into it, so as per usual, it's time for a review.\n\n!! SPOILERS AHEAD !!\n\n**Things I like about Palia**\n- There isn't really a time limit. Because it runs on IRL time for a lot of things, there are no seasons or specific slots of time where you could potentially miss something because you forgot to look at the clock. Stores are always open and NPCs are always available.\n- The npcs have a lot of life to them. They have relationships with other characters outside of what the player experiences. They have pasts, they have presents, and they have aspirations for the future.\n- The storyline is pretty good, if you're paying attention. You do have to put in the effort to read the hidden tablets and the engravings and whatnot to piece things together - you can also get dialogue from characters that elude to things that have happened. This game does NOT spoon feed you the lore - or anything, really.\n- I personally appreciate the variety of romanceable characters. You have a couple that are older, you have a couple that are younger, you have varying ethnicities and you have a non-organic companion ( I hesitate to call him a robot, he is fully sentient and conscious ).\n- The graphics are really pretty! It's stylized in a way that's charming without being cartoonish. \n- Choosing a body type in the character creation screen DOES NOT equate to gendered pronouns. I know this is nitpicky but I'm always frustrated when I have to pick between an accurate depiction of me, and being comfortable with what the npcs are calling me (I tend to create my character in my likeness, instead of creating a new character like some folks do - no shame either way!).\n\n**Things I do NOT like about Palia**\n- It. Takes. So. Long. To. Do. *Anything.* The game runs off of an irl 24 hour clock (as most mmos do). While in-game days are shorter (I think about 20 minutes or so), mechanics like smithing, wood cutting, smelting, etc. can take upwards of half an hour depending on what tools you have and what you're trying to make. You can only give npcs gifts once per IRL DAY. Romantic gifts are only allowed once per irl *WEEK*. Everything takes a LONG time. You really need to have both time on your hands and a lot of patience to get anywhere.\n- The game is still technically in beta, despite being released, so I'm a little more forgiving about this, but there are a lot of grammar and spelling errors. Sometimes npcs repeat dialogue in a single interaction, sometimes they glitch through the floor, sometimes they just up and disappear for a few minutes and pop up on the other side of the map. There are a lot of minor, quality of life glitches like this throughout the game - however I have yet to find any glaring issues with gameplay and mechanics that would keep you from enjoying the game.\n- Most of the cosmetics are locked behind a paywall - not a huge deal to me, because I don't really care for most extravagant outfits and fxs and whatnot, but if you're looking to really personalize your character, be prepared to spend some money. It's not *cheap* either, you could spend 20 bucks on a single outfit.\n- Very few of the mechanics are explained. While most of them are simple (chop tree, cut wood, make chair) others are less intuitive (interact with npcs, get renown, find local shrine, commune with shrine, spend renown to gain xp bonuses \"focus\", eat food to keep focus, use focus to gain more xp to create more things to interact with more npcs, rinse, repeat). None of these are really explained, you have to hover over icons and text boxes to get more information, or stumble upon something and remember it for later. It's fine if you're used to the fetch-quest type games, but if you're new to this it can be frustrating.\n\n**The low-down**\nI, personally, would not recommend this game unless you are *really* into grinding. If you want to get anywhere in the game you're going to have to lose hours of your day just to get through a single lore quest. There isn't a whole lot to keep you occupied in the meantime.\nIf you're into that, go for it! If you'd rather shave your teeth on a chalkboard than spend an hour smelting stone bricks, maybe play Fields of Mistria instead.",

      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-03-06)](https://steam/76561198039821823)\nWell, the good news is that Palia is a free-to-play game so I didn't have to spend any money on it to discover that it wasn’t for me. This game feels somewhat incomplete and like an uglier and slightly different version of World of Warcraft. I didn’t realize how much I wasn’t into the idea of another MMORPG until I tried this game out. I was slogging through the character conversations and dreading seeing yet another quest marker pop up and gathering materials.\n\nThere are long loading screens in this game even on a high-end PC, and they sometimes have wait lists with other players ahead of you, clearly a server limitation. I don't like having to sit there in silence waiting for things to load to get into another zone.\n\nThe UI is hit and miss. The grid-like placement, rotation, stacking and movement options for housing and furniture are great and intuitive. I wish other games had the same decoration and organization system as Palia.\n\nThe character creator was clunky. It’s missing a zoom-in (scroll in/scroll out) option, and I’d have to flip through tabs to get it to zoom in on my character’s face again. Somehow I pressed a button that undid my clothing choices multiple times and I was on edge with my clicks so that I wouldn’t mess things up again. Similar to Hogwarts Legacy, my character looked way prettier and sounded way better in the character creator. I look at her sometimes running around and I think that she is now ugly and her voice turned out very annoying. I don't know how these character creators are not translating accurately to the game itself.\n\nWhen I came into this game as a new player, there were multiple times where quest markers on the map were unclear and NPCs were not located where they were supposed to be according to the quest notes. This led to a lot of frustration and running around and then giving up. Later, I saw there was some sort of a bug that kept NPCs from being where they should have been that was being patched. Not a great first impression. Sometimes quests are not marked on the map and sometimes they are, and I am not sure why.\n\nThere are no mounts in this game, but I kind of feel like there should be because there are large areas to run around. They would also make things look more interesting.\n\nThe premium cash shop has some pretty cosmetics and some really rough looking ones with ugly colors and ragged edges to the designs.\n\nThings feel kind of empty in the starting zone. It's a bunch of brand new players mixed in with players covered in premium cash shop gear and pets. I don't really feel like it's a particularly beautiful land to be in.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't find any of the NPCs that are romanceable to be appealing. They're all just purple people and one robot.\n\nThe thing that really soured me toward this game is that your dialogue choices impact what personality element is chosen for you later on, and at one point I misclicked a dialogue choice and wasn't able to see what I selected and there was no way to go back or to press undo, or to review what I had answered historically, etc. This mysteriously answered and missed conversation that I had with an NPC would not stop haunting me, and apparently if you ask support for your character to be reset, it causes you to lose all your referral rewards and purchased real world cosmetics on your character! So I was stuck with this feeling of messing up, tainting the game for me.\n\nThe fishing system is really impressive. It's well done and enjoyable, unlike some other games which make it really tedious. Bug catching was also cute and fun, with the idea of smoke bombing a bug to stun it and pick it up.\n\nI enjoyed the soil tilling and plant watering mechanics. Walking around your soil patch with your tool and seeing it visibly make changes is very neat.\n\nI didn't enjoy hunting with a bow and arrow. You chase a small sprinting target animal around trying to hit it multiple times while your arrows are wasted.\n\nAs someone who played World of Warcraft for years and then quit because it started feeling like a second job, I am not finding this MMO to be pleasurable enough to continue it. It's not as high quality and attractive as World of Warcraft, and I quit that game.",

      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-03-22)](https://steam/76561198064058024)\nPalia is a really enjoyable life sim, cozy building game with some relatively okay social aspects, but since launch has continuously grown to become a money sink for cosmetics, and unfortunately hasn't done much in the way of improving gameplay since launch.\n\nEvery update since open beta launch has undoubtedly contained more updates to premium offerings than there has to the base game offerings. Pets, housing landscapes, skin tools, etc, are all locked behind money purchases, with none available (that I am aware of) in game. Granted I haven't played since middle of last year, but every time I come back to reach a patch, it seems like there's maybe one QOL update, and 5 premium shop additions, with the usual bug fixing. \n\nIt's a free game, they have to make money, but at some point the game gets so stale and repetitive that you just zone out. Hell, there hasn't been any additional big open zones since the closed beta! There's many ways to improve upon the gameplay flow to make things more engaging and more exciting, but Palia has gone the route of premium purchases to keep the services afloat. Until they start balancing out giving some simpler rewards to regular players and letting premium players flare up with their shiny outfit, i'm probably going to leave this game on my backburner. \n\ntl;dr It's a free game and has some okay gameplay for 5 hours or so, then gets reptitive. The premium store is pretty aggressive on offerings and prices, and the development team seems to put more effort into updating the store offerings than the actual game.",

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-03-28)](https://steam/76561198398361450)\nOh boy, where to begin. First of all, I love parts of the game, but the further you get in the story, the more buggy it is. I've had to restart quests I've already done, received duplicate awards for something I did a long time ago, and don't get me started on the controls (I use a controller on PC). \r\n\r\nSo, first thing I'll say is that at some point in the quests, the game becomes just straight grinding for a while. There's not much happening story-wise, and the things you have to gather for quests are sometimes ridiculous for rewards that are meh. My first weeks and days of playing, I WAS HOOKED. This game was my new hyperfixation, I thought about it at school, work and even in my dreams. It was fun, rewarding because there was constantly something new, and it was fun to just build my house and upgrade my things. But after a while, I would log on, and not have anything to do. I'd go chop some wood, mine some rocks or whatever, every single time. I think that if you play with friends, that's okay, you can still have fun with them. I LOVED exploring the new temples, finding every secret and chests. Oh, the chest. Why? Why can't you sell them? You have so many at the end, and they are too ugle to display, especially if you have 15 of the same sort. Sure, you can give them to Tish, but you have so many that it's stupid and you can't keep up with the one day gift rule. \r\n\r\nThe game is fine, the world is charming, and the characters are mostly (looking at you Kenli) loveable. But mannn is it wasted when the game is so unpolished like it is. Bugs that force me to quit and restart the game, 12 year olds fighting over something stupid in chat, and it's clear that the devs are focusing more on the money side of things by releasing new skins and outfits. Sure, it's nice, and as a cosmetic fan usually i'm on board, but the game gets boring because there aren't that many events and story updates. \r\n\r\nAlso, the control mapping IS HELLA STUPID! Why would you ever think that mapping the B button for the jump is alright? And the building system suuuuuuckkkssss. It counts your player collision as you move things in the overhead house menu, you have to place things individually for paths, and it's impossible to put stuff up on shelves or on top of dressers. Also, very sad that the pets are not really used. It's just for cosmetics. Would love to just pet my companion or something.\r\n\r\nIt seems like the game encourages exploration, but sometimes you do a hard parkour (eg the lighthouse) only to be rewarded with nothing. Nothing at all. You get blocked by invisible walls on a ledge that looks climbable and the vines are HELLA bugged and make you fall most of the time. Also, it's very difficult to notice what is gatherable or interactible. The big trees fool me all the time, because they look EXACTLY like the regular ones (eg the large heartwood trees), sometimes the decorative plants are more vibrant than the actual gatherable ones, and the stone and iron ores are not that different visually wise, especially in certain lighting.\r\n\r\nI did not understand the community? What does it actually do? I haven't ever used it in the how many hours I've played this game. I thought Palia had a way for your friends and you to share a village and build it together, but it looks like that's not the case.\r\n\r\nOverall: Did I enjoy this game? Yes. But as a game dev myself, it's clear this game needs A LOT more polishing, and the build mode is VERY rough. But as this game is still in Beta, I have to give them some slack. But as the game is still in this stage almost 2 years later, it is a bit worrying.\r\n\r\n If you are a casual gamer and only want a cute game with stardew valley esque mecanics and characters, go for it! If you are someone who wants to have a great time with friends, this game is for you! But just know that Palia is not perfect and has a bunch of flaws. If you are planning to beat the game, this is not for you.",

I was exposed to Stardew for the first time a handful of months ago, and was surprised how much I enjoyed the laid back gameplay, while still enjoying a deep story and plenty of stuff to do.  A buddy of mine mentioned Palia and told me he got hooked on it, so I figured I would give it a shot.  I currently have around 25 hours into it after less than 2 weeks.  It's really nice having a game I can jump into after work to garden, gather materials, knock out a few quests, etc.  There's no pressure, no time limit, no health bar, no competition, no getting mad because some 12 year old sniped me from across the map.  It's just relaxing.  I also like that whether I jump on for 20 minutes or play for hours, I'm still progressing and doing something.  It really is a game you can play at your own pace without any pressure.  Currently, I'm in a party with my buddy that told me about it, my 36 year old brother, and my girlfriend.  All of us have been having a blast managing our plots and doing quests.  When more than one of us is online at the same time, it's fun to jump on discord to chat, gather materials, and help each other upgrade our skills.

So, with that stuff out of the way, let's talk about the ups and downs of this game.\n\nFirst, the positives. Well, it's a UE game, so expect the visuals to be top-notch... and they are. This game is absolutely beautiful. The scenery is very lovely, the characters are well-made and well-animated. There are numerous concurrent storylines to invest in, and every character falls into a particular archetype or two. Naturally, there are romance options, and the game doesn't care if it's het or not. Tish and Jel in particular have wonderful romance paths. Tish in particular is involved with what is probably the most expansive skill in the game, which is Furniture Making. There's a dizzying array of stuff to craft to build your home, and the skill itself is little more than \"collect stuff, make-stuff-animation\". There's no complex steps to this skill, unlike Cooking... which I will get to later in this review. So once you have the materials, you can just build it in a few seconds on your workbench, then place it in your home. Object placement is very flexible, though it can be a bit glitchy at times. There are other skills to work on, such as Fishing, Bug-Catching, Hunting, and my personal favorite, Foraging. This involves both collecting plants and chopping trees. It's surprisingly relaxing. Farming is another skill worth investing in, and is probably the easiest to level quickly once you have enough soil plots. It's probably also the best way to make money. Once you're making a lot of star-quality produce, your finances will quickly become a non-issue. Another major positive of this game is the item request system. You can request of others to send you a particular item, and others can opt to fulfill the request. This is part of one quest in particular, and doing this a lot earns you Renown, which should be obvious as to what it is. Use Renown to boost your Focus bar, which increases the amount of experience you earn for each skill. Nom food to keep your Focus bar filled. Very solid mechanics there. Oh, and there's a kitty. Zeki is awesome. I swear he didn't force me to say that... but anyway, the last positive bit I will mention here, and it's a major one, is the sound design. The. Sound. Is. Incredible. This may even be a larger shining star than the visuals. The music is absolutely beautiful and is affected by location and time, with some tracks changing instrument sets in real time depending on where you are, such as in the town in Kilima. There's a base track that plays, and it will vary depending on which building you're in. That's such a great technique that not a lot of games utilize. BOTW did this in Hyrule Castle, and I thought it was perfect. Anyway, sound effects are also super important. The game does foley sounds correctly, and you can hone your hunting and bug-catching skills by remembering the various sounds of the critters you're after and keeping an ear out for them (or two ears, really). At no point does the music become intrusive; it's designed to be background music to enhance the cozy feel of the game. Just absolutely brilliant sound design all-around.\n\nOK so... the negatives. Oh man, where do I even start. This game is plagued with problems. I cannot even get into the issues without acknowledging the Sugarfoot in the room, which is the completely broken coldet. This issue is so legendary that I think they keep it broken on purpose as to not disrupt people's expectations. Climbing cliffs in particular is so broken that I'm wondering how this even passed QA. Sure, blame it on the beta status, but it's been like this since the beginning with no sign of ever being addressed. Sometimes, parts of the scenery don't load properly, or colliders don't load properly, leading to all kinds of hilarious nonsense. I once found that I could walk completely through hills and even go totally underwater with no consequences. Sometimes you get trees that you can completely walk through, and although this hasn't happened since I started playing this version, sometimes chopping down trees with Muujin in them will launch you into the sky. That was the most hilarious nonsense ever. I've taken video of it when playing on the Switch version. These collective coldet issues can be a major problem on certain main story quests, where being able to navigate the environment swiftly and accurately are key to success. But anyway, other issues are minor, but some are more important than others. There's a MASSIVE amount of typos in the game. Misspelled words, incorrect punctuation, doubled words, you name it. It seems no one is on staff to proofread or even test. I found one bit in particular where the response option was the text that the character was supposed to say next, preceded by a scripting control code. What a hilarious screwup. Other issues include things such as the game forgetting your run configuration, so you run when you're not holding down the run button, and numerous little glitches when you're editing your home. I once ran into a glitch where I was trying to move something inside of the tent and the entire tent started moving on its own. Plot editing in general is loaded with little glitches like that. There's been times where I try to edit a room's windows and press Up to scroll the view and the edit option goes away and the Esc key does nothing. Seriously broken stuff. However, most of this pales in comparison to the biggest problem the game has so far, which is the fact that the developers rarely take player feedback, or even bug reports, seriously. Oh, and the cosmetics are WAY too expensive. Their business model is completely stupid. People would be more inclined to purchase cosmetics if they brought the prices down considerably. As it stands, expect to pay $20-$30 for most cosmetic items. That's way past the threshold most people are willing to pay. Bring it down to under $10 a pop and way more money would be going into the game, which would allow for more money to pay staff, which would lead to a better game. My only other gripe with this game, and it's kind of minor compared to the other major issues but is still important to me and many others, is the total lack of aesthetics when it comes to your player character. This follows the current-day trend of character amorphism. If you play as a female character, don't expect to see any kind of feminine beauty. Your character will be washboard-flat and you cannot change this. If you play as a male character, don't expect to be physically masculine at all. You're a feminine stick insect and you cannot change this. All of the base outfits lack any kind of cuteness or appeal, and even most of the premium outfits are similarly sterile. This is, as they call it, an \"appeal to the modern audience\", which everyone knows does not actually exist. The only time I see other players even wearing premium cosmetics are when they're among the very few items that actually add some feminine charm to their character. Cuteness and sex appeal sells, people...\n\nOh... and Cooking is a terrible skill. Worse than Fishing. Overcomplicated minigame that only exists to allow for party-type skilling. The interface is awful and unintuitive and the steps don't usually make any sense.\n\nSo all in all, yeah... it's got massive amounts of issues, but it's also got massive amounts of charm. This game has a ridiculous amount of potential, but is being kneecapped by amateur buffoonery and current-day social apologetics. It's absolutely worth playing though, and is easy to get addicted to.",

      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-03-26)](https://steam/76561198343830604)\nPalia is a decent game, maybe, if you stay completely free to play. I would not recommend purchasing anything from the cash shop because it was not that long ago when we couldn't equip many of the cash shop items we had already purchased. This was not cause for alarm on their end. It took them several weeks to fix the issue, and there was never any compensation for the delay for those who had already purchased the items that we could no longer equip.\r\n\r\nWith each new update, they manage to make this game less and less functional. The game has been plagued with game breaking glitches, including but not limited to: broken tool swapping, broken zone swapping, broken group functions, not being able to use your purchased cosmetics for weeks at a time, can't move items on your plot, can't find items that were on your plot but have now vanished into the ground, players falling through the ground on a loop and getting stuck under buildings/terrain that have vanished, etc. Instead of focusing on improving game play by fixing these issues, they just keep adding new features. We can't swap tools to collect resources during actual game play, but now we can emote at each other with colorful stickers! (insert angry Hassian sticker here)\r\n\r\nThey never fail, however, to add new items for purchase in the cash shop. Every single update, without fail, includes more digital stuff to buy. Even during the period of time where none of us could use our tool cosmetics because they were causing people to crash, they still managed to release additional cosmetics... including new tool skins!!!\r\n\r\nThe story is pretty good, the paid cosmetics are super cute, and there is an abundance of cute free to play outfits as well. The cozy piece of this \"cozy game\" fails because of the frustration from the glitches and they have completely lost my trust as far as the cash shop goes. It's not unreasonable to expect to be able to use the things you've paid for, unless you are a character in Palia. I would love to see them fix the issues with this game because it really was great while it lasted but as I said, buyer beware on the cash shop.",

A typical farm-management game but it's a free-to-play game, so expect some cash-grab content. Now, don't get me wrong, I love farm-management games. But I got more from Stardew Valley, Sun Haven, and Slime Rancher. There's a few more out there, but I find them much more ful-filling. I can't say that's not fair against Palia. It has potential, truly but it's really not for me. I feel there's too much running around for quests and not really focusing on much else.",

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-03-24)](https://steam/76561197996083121)\nThe harvest game I've been craving, that doesn't have punishing MMO elements, instead sharing loot of those participating in things like hunting as well as buffs for anyone participating in the same activity near each other like fishing. NPC likes or \"weekly wants' change weekly (IRL time every monday) so you have ample time to acquire items to increase your friendships or to progress your budding romances. \n\nMy main qualms are the myriad of lil bugs & glitches: \n\n- Lighting tends to freak out when going from an indoors to outdoors (or vis vers), \n- Some terrain forgets its not supposed to be visible to a small hill becomes the only terrain in your personal plots back area, Going a certain depth into water tells the game to unstuck you with a blackout but if you jump or move out of that depth it freaks out and flashes you,\n- Certain areas either do not have the climbing rule applied to it trapping you in between terrain or in water,\n- Certain areas you should be able to jump but are incapable of traversing for no apparent reason.\n- There is also issues with the fishing indicator as you cast, the way it blinks makes it hard to track how far it has gotten and the speed in which the cast moves doesn't help that.\n- If you upgrade your home by adding a room, if the existing room's wall has items on it they will disappear. You have to leave the game then log in and check your storage.\n- Some loot when dropped by the creature/tree/whatever will become invisible and you have to use your HUD's compass whilst frantically mashing F to find it.\n\n\nYet in spite of all that I find myself hopelessly addicted in my special interest hyper focus way. I can get enough enjoyment in daily minutia & ongoing stories to keep me playing.\n\n\nPlayers from before my time tell me that this used to be a passion project worth following, but that now it just sits there rotting just finding new ways to convince you to spend money. A lot of the issues I have with the game are issues that have persisted for quite a while unfixed, as long as they can continue to make money then it hasn't been worth the newer owners' time.

There are quite a few bugs that can get annoying. Seems devs may be focused a bit more on cosmetics than fixing bugs in updates, from what I've seen and heard. \n\nIt's in beta. It will get fixed. Loads of play value here. In-game community has been fantastic. No toxic kids like most games. Everyone just talking maturely and helping one another out, very nice to see in-game.\n\nThe story progresses nicely in the beginning, but within about 3 (irl) days once you get to the Watcher quest, things slow down DRAMATICALLY. My guess is lack of content after the whole Watcher questline, but it's literally like hitting a brick wall. I feel initial gameplay needs to be slowed down quite a bit for the moment as it doesn't take much atm to progress. The longest thing so far is finding a Shepp which involves a lvl 4 friendship which is my last remaining Main Quest (all sides so far completed).\n\n7/10\nFix the bugs continue with content updates and it'll be a 10/10 in no time.

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-03-18)](https://steam/76561199229980512)\nOkay, so this is a bit complicated. Please bear with me.\n\nI was there for the announcement of Palia. And for the beta. I shared my link, told all my friends, cuz the game idea was amazing to me. I legit could NOT wait to play it. When the beta opened, I worked *really hard* to get my laptop's graphics intel updated, downloaded all the packs, etc. It was a headache, but I was *so sure* it would be more than worth it. After all, the game description had been everything I had wanted in a game.\nWhen we tried the beta, we were disappointed. We understood that this was just beta and were trying to give grace for early game development, but the controls were confusing, it was so laggy (taking FOREVER to load anywhere and kept kicking us), and we didnt feel like we were getting anywhere after hours of play. When we tried the shop for strength to press on? No way. Prices were WAY too high.\nWe ended up putting the game down, and I told myself it would be better when it released on Switch, where the controls would at least be more familiar for me. So I waited again. Eventually, it released, and I was excited to see the improvements.\nBut it wasnt much different. I found it incredibly difficult to feel engaged. I was still disappointed in the character design options, which, while better than a lot of games, was not offering what I wanted for my character look. And the shop was just so bad. To pay for a single outfit in the shop, you have to pay at least $15. That seemed bizarre to me, as I have had experience in Toram Online (another F2P game) and Rune Factory, Story of Seasons, Animal Crossing, and FFXI (non F2P games). Palia doesnt have SO many mechanics that the others do, yet the only way to get cool outfits here is to pay, with ridiculously high prices. Even with the MagiMarket event, we just couldnt find the zeal to play.\nI put the game down again and ended up removing it from storage on Switch (the sheer storage space it took up was utterly unsustainable for me). Something like a year has gone by, idk. I decided to try Steam and see what had changed. I endured the re-updating my laptop graphics (~2 hours), and, boy-- How is it STILL this glitchy and laggy? At least it didnt keep kicking me, but it was still noticeably bad. And the shop hasnt gotten better-- if anything, it's worse. No new free cosmetics (or character customization), no access to free pets, the prices are terrible and even apply to stickers now, the layout was still unintuitive, and I also couldnt find any way to change usernames. At every turn, the game has features locked behind a paywall, and to those arguing that the payable items aren't \"functional\"-- that depends on what you're calling function. There're no combat/pvp aspects in Palia, marketing itself as a chill sim-type game. That means having nice outfits, cute companions, cool land terrains, and stickers/emotes are ALL parts of the core *functions* of the game (literally all related to the very appeal and substance of the game). But I digress. I tried to see the rest of the game by itself, treating the shop like DLC. Yet despite spending 4-5 hours of dedicated play this time, I barely got my house built, not a single relationship moved beyond level 1, I kept having to run all around (which takes FOREVER) for quests just to get one baby step forward, and spent an unreasonable amount of time just waiting on things like wood planks to process. I'll say, some features seem to have improved, and I think a couple of mechanics were added, changed, or streamlined (all good), but a lot less than I would have expected for the time elapsed. There were certainly countless of added shop items. Surely a few more mechanics, maps, or free stuff could have been expected? And Twitch drops kind of feel similar to a paywall. Like, \"Sure, we'll give you a few cute things occasionally, but only if you come promote our socials and add money to us by engaging in our content\". Not that they're the only ones who do this, but it becomes more apparent with the rest of the frustrations. \nBefore anyone mistakes me as a hater: The concept is great. They have several clever ideas, and I enjoy the aesthetic vibes. As much as the sim-ish look and over-the-top expressions bother me, the devs did seem to have put a lot of effort into personality, story, and design for each NPC. I sincerely applaud that. I get what people mean when they say, \"It's F2P, so just buy a couple of outfits from the shop and consider it the payment for the game to support the devs\". But the prices are so high, and the rest of the gameplay so weak and so slow. If I attempted to purchase enough outfits to make me content with a purely aesthetic game and counted it as the adjustable cost for the game, I would feel as though I had purchased a half-finished game. This isn't beta anymore. It shouldnt be this bugged or laggy, and it shouldnt be so slow and grindy. I like that it has room to grow, but there are some lessons Palia can learn from similar games like Sky CotL. Like it or not, the cosmetics are a large portion of appeal to an rpg-- that's why so much attention is put on them. Sky is a similarly story-driven sim-type F2P game, and it doesnt have all the npc interactions or farming-sim (though they did recently add customizable housing). The beauty, story, music, character design, and co-op gameplay make Sky highly appealing to so many people. Recently, their biggest issue has been varying currencies that have lessened the chill aspect and made it feel too grindy, losing a lot of people (even I barely play now) while also raising prices and feeding off FOMO to drain their audience. Toram is amazing for F2P, and it's brought me to literal tears over their gacha odds, losing me in the process. But they have so much more going on than Palia. And there are SO many free cosmetics, not just gacha, dyeable and adjustable. And Niki's Dressup similarly does a gacha thing, though the scarcity of resource and grind of gameplay was what lost me there too. If you're seeing a trend, it's because there is one.\nPlease dont misunderstand me-- I 100%-ed EoW and have ungodly numbers of hours on BotW and TotK. I'm also combing through post-game Hogwarts Legacy for every Merlin Trial, Vault, Quest, etc. I do not mind grind, effort, or time, but the journey should be nearly as enjoyable as the destination, or else the rewards are empty/effort unsustainable. This applies to co-op functions, character customization, payable content-- All of it should be giving the player a sense of enjoyment in the actual play. The grind may be taxing but it's still fun. You may have to cough up some money for some payable content, but it feels worthwhile and not overbearing. You should be able to tell a story with your character design-- that's the whole appeal to custom characters at all. We want it to feel like us or whatever we're trying to be. Whatever we're trying to voice. A game should not feel like work or it ceases to be a game. Games are meant to be fun, uniting, and fulfilling. I wish the gaming industry would not forget this. I know games are still products that must be marketed, but dont forget the value of the product in the effort to make value out of it....\n\nI genuinely WANT to love this game. I still think it has so much untapped potential. My hope is that perhaps the devs will research to find what works that love-of-the-game more so into Palia. I hope that one day I can return again to this game and find the journey to be genuinely fulfilling. I could say that maybe this game just wasn't designed for me, but not only are there numerous functional errors but also so many other voices repeating the same things. I sincerely wish the best for this game.\n\nWishing all the best and much love,\n\n~LilKetsi~\n\nEdit: I am seeing more potential and am powering through. I still wish I could answer neutral, but for now we shall see....",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-03-18)](https://steam/76561198843818438)\nThis is a really fun game, and I find it very enjoyable. Only problem I've been having is that weird crash \"pure virtual function called while application is running (GIsRunning == 1). So that's been very frustrating. \r\n\r\nThe game was running fine, and I decided to change my settings down a bit after a few hours of playing. I looked at a recommendation for best running on low spec pc and it said to switch to DirectX 11. After I did that, this crash has been happening almost non stop. I either can't get IN the game past the initial loading screen, or it crashes mid game after a little under an hour. \r\n\r\nSo, I'd say, if you have a low spec pc, be careful with messing with the settings because my game was fine until I did that :( I've done the force run dx11 by going into properties on steam and typing in -dx11 and it helped me get back into the game, but then it just crashed again after 30 minutes :') \r\n\r\nVery fun and enjoyable game otherwise!!!",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-03-18)](https://steam/76561199075164262)\nThe game can be kind of super buggy sometimes but that's mostly just with visuals like the UI, models not showing up (rejoin the game to fix that bug), player and npc models going through the floor, and sometimes I'm unable to click on specific UI. I've never experienced serious lag or have had any issues with data not being saved- I've seen negative reviews on that but I personally have never dealt with that. The game is insanely addicting and there's so much you can do and it's all for free. All you have to pay for is cosmetics- which, in my honest opinion, is pretty seriously overpriced. I'm aware that cosmetics are the only way the devs can make money off this game but an outfit being $25 USD is insane, I don't care lol. I want to support the devs and I have spent money in the game, but it is genuinely ridiculous to me. But the base game is free and there isn't any p2w or paywall for more content behavior going on, so I don't really mind that. You can do every single thing the game offers all for free and it's a pretty big game. I'm sure some of the quests may be boring or frustrating for people (me included) but I believe the game offers enough, even if I paid for the game I think I would still find massive enjoyability in it so the fact that it's free is very generous just in my opinion, at least. The villagers are so sweet I love getting to know them, even the ones I don't like right off the bat, I learn more about them over time and it gives me such a good understanding of their character type and the village's general vibe and it's honestly so nice. I highly recommend this game, I've never played something this fun and addictive before. My only real complaint is that the premium shop is overpriced (completely). Again, I know that's how they make their money but damn. Borderline every item (like an outfit) is $20 minimum...I don't think the price points are defendable lol.\r\n\r\nAlso the game mechanics are actually really nice! The fishing minigame is smooth and doesn't require you to hurt your hand clicking which is very nice and pleasant because every other game's fishing minigame requires stuff like that which is obnoxious. Also there's Einar. Best robot.",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-03-18)](https://steam/76561198064220567)\nSuch a cozy game with a pleasant community. Even in early release I've really enjoyed my time playing. Decorating your own plot feels very similar to Animal Crossing, and you even get to tour other plots to check out what others have done. I happily gave money to this little free to play game, to ensure that the devs can keep improving it!\r\nAll that said there are some rough parts. The controller support is very early stages and I'll have moments where the game does not respond to my controller, though it's largely just been a minor inconvenience. The most obnoxious time is when I'm cooking and I'll chop one or two ingredients then the next one will not recognize my controller and I'll have to switch to mouse. But I've never had an issue with the controller that's hindered me while fishing, hunting or bug-hunting! And speaking of early access, there are bugs in the game play like one of the games not working right during the festival week, which can only be remedied by exiting and re-entering the area, at which point you've already missed half the game.  And sometimes you'll try to enter a new area and the loading screen will spin for a bit then pop you right back where you were, so you have to try again. Mostly annoying if you're trying to get somewhere at a specific time, but never takes more than a single attempt before it response correctly.\r\nBut that said all my complaints can easily be tied to it being early access, and I'm confident that they're working on fixing these bugs!\r\n\r\nWhat others have said about it being grindy are true, and that's not for everyone, but I quite enjoy it. Because in this game there's a reward for the grind, and it never takes to long to get what you're looking for.\r\nUnless you're looking for silk. That's always a slog. \r\n\r\nLooking forward to seeing more of what this game has to offer as it continues improving!",

A couple friends and I enjoy sitting in a discord call playing this game.

      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-03-17)](https://steam/76561199152006513)\nThe game was very fun to play at first. \r\nHowever, after spending quite a bit of time playing. I feel as though the progression can relate to building a base on Clash of Clans. It can almost feel annoying needing to grind so much to craft furniture and decorate your plot. Some higher tier resources can be very difficult to find. I have played over 100 hours and progress has felt so slow. I go on expeditions to gather resources and will spend an hour in real life gathering them- only to be able to find enough things to craft one piece of furniture. Which I might not even be able to craft since smelting some of the ore can take a couple hours in real life depending on what it is. The cash shop is extremely expensive- an outfit can cost $30-$50 USD and is only cosmetic. It would be cool if pets had unique quirks or abilities but they are also only cosmetic. You play and grind and its a lot of fun but you get to a point where finding resources is so difficult and time consuming that you lose motivation to play. There are also quite of few random bugs which I have never really dealt with before. Buildings going invisible, stairs not necessarily becoming invisible but my character will disappear and then reappear at the bottom. Their is practically no story which is also kind of a bummer. Whatever quest there are feel somewhat repetitive and anti climatic. Building relationships with villagers takes a long time so much so I don't remember the last time i did a quest. The quest will have you running around the whole map which can get pretty annoying as well. After playing for some time if this game had costed anything I dont think I would have bought it knowing what i do now. It was fun- but now things can take multiple hours in real life to complete- similar to clash of clans which has caused me to completely lose motivation.... again fun at first but only if you have A LOT of time to spare to play and grind for resources. I have put 109 hours into this game and am STILL barely making any money from farming apple trees and other resources as well. Not sure if I will keep playing anymore which is a bummer because the concept was there but I am assuming new management? has completely shifted the focus to in game purchases.",
      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-03-17)](https://steam/76561197965009289)\nI wanted to like this game, but it's just a game full of doing chores. After 20 hours, there's no combat that I've seen other than hunting, and that's pretty basic. The adventuring is pretty basic, and co-op doesn't amount to anything because there's really no combat. You just run around and explore, and that only amounts to a few hours of gameplay. This game is pretty boring.",

The art-style is great and the level of customization when building your farm & house are exceptional.  The main story is intriguing and some of the mini-games are unique and enjoyable--cooking is great. And when you get to the underground, Hot Pot is addictive and well-worth spending and in-game night on.   It's an MMO, which you rarely see in this genre, but while you are encouraged to team up, you can definitely play solo, if that's your style. \r\n\r\nOnly potential downsides are it does get a bit grindy trying to keep up with all you need to build, but that's to be expected with something you can really put your mark on.  And it does seem to lack any sense of danger, but that's minor at best.  \r\n\r\nOverall, great game.  It has micro-transactions for cosmetic purposes, but it's definitely no pay-to-win.

Then last week I picked it back up with a friend who's been showing me the roped and NOW it's enjoyable. I finally feel like I know what I'm doing. But I had so many questions, if he hadn't been there I probably would've uninstalled it again. It's  little buggy/laggy for me but still a super cozy gaming experience with a decent amount of things to do. \n\nI will say it bugs the absolute crap out of me that I had to start playing on a different steam profile in order to start a new save/character. I didn't want to start playing again on a save that I had initially started a year ago. Total pain in the ass. Forever waiting for them to either fix that or introduce a multiple save option. \n\nAll in all 7/10 because it's free to play so it's worth the try. \n\nFree to play probably also explains why the cosmetics are SO expensive.

An odd combination at first glance, but the developers of this game have knocked it out of the park. Crafting is interesting and collecting materials isn't terribly grindy. I particularly like the fishing mechanic which is very different from other games that I have played. Finally, the wholesome atmosphere is really good at helping me ignore the dumpster fire of American politics right now.\r\n\r\nI haven't purchased any in-game content, but I going to very soon.

I also truly admire how the husband/wife couples and the father/daughter couple both bring so much life to the game!. So many romanceable games I feel like don't highlight the family aspect of life anymore. I truly get so much wholesome vibes from how Badruu, Dalilah, N'ao and Auni react, truly a wholesome little family. I also love the different events the team has been popping out as of recently.

I would pay for cosmetics but they're overpriced even at 50% discount and they don't look that great on other players I see. Most of the time the tricked out shinies just show as ghost generic avatars. I'd pay for farming square increases without starting a whole new plot, or being able to sell furniture instead of trashing it, or better house options. \r\n\r\nAs is, the game would be solid if it didn't require server connection that cuts out a lot. I've clocked server loss intervals as fast as every 15 secs some days. Also, some of the server hosts post odd messages sometimes. But overall a good game.",

The quests that require other people to complete can be easily done, because practically everyone helps out, no strings attached, when someone asks!! And they're actually fun to do (in my opinion. I love team cooking lol). \r\n\r\nThe community is really great. I haven't seen any spam bots or trolls after 83hrs of gameplay; and at daily events everyone is so polite and eager to share the spoils.\r\n\r\nAlso it'S free to play and NOT pay to win! There are microtransactions, but for cosmetics only.\r\n\r\nOnly con I have so far is the lack of diversity for character creation. I'd love to see different body types (skinny, muscled, fat, tall, small, etc.) and noses other than the button/d*sney style.

You can obtain all housing items in game and the only thing you actually pay real life money for are the cosmetics. You can do it all in this game, from hunting and fishing, to growing crops and catching bugs.

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-03-07)](https://steam/76561199827143862)\nIf you like Animal Crossing, this is the next best thing! Think of Animal Crossing mixed with The Sims! The game is entertaining to play! It's just like playing The Sims, but you have quests, play online, and with other people. The game is \"FREE\" to play. The only money you will spend will be for the costumes, pets, gliders, and different overlays for your tools. They have no real use, they are just aesthetics. Which are hard not to buy. I did buy a few. \n\nThe only issue I have with the game, is with some of the players. Some players like to \"shame\" others for not sharing a resource. They also tend to gang up and \"shame\" players. Obviously, these are the same individuals who think that everyone should get a trophy for participation, even though their team lost! The same people who hide behind their keyboards and bully people. I allowed my little cousin to play with my character and she came crying to me that someone online said mean things to her (she is only 6). Don't say anything to them! STAY CALM! You don't have to share resources, but it is polite to share (only if you want to), it is not a \"RULE.\" Just block them, and if you want to, you can report them for harassment. Only if!\n\nOver all I give the game 8 out of 10 stars.",

Don't want a cottage? Build a treehouse or even a castle! The community is super friendly and welcoming to new players; never seen a more united community in any MMO before. The only downside thus far is the lack of maps but I'm sure that will change in due time.

The game We Happy Few was about the kind of people who claim to like extremely docile stuff like this. WHF was about people being controlled by drugs and censorship. Expect a lot of that if you make the mistake of trying to be real and have fun in this game. :)\n\nOverall, the game is unplayable in many ways. I focus on the fact that it is a technical mess and overall unappealing.\n\n(The ideological term speak with stuff like \"body type\" and \"type A' and \"type B\" instead of 'man' and 'woman' makes this game unappealing in both fiction and non-fiction universes. Definitely do not let your impressionable kids play games like this one without supervision. Show the right things, not Palia that is some ideologically infested dogma project. )\n\nRuns like a dead donkey in a tar funeral... on ice. 8 GB recommended my donkey - I have that on Win10 and it crashed during the intro cutscene following the character creation first time around. After that it was just a laggy mess.\n\nA fun fact: you cannot disable anti-aliasing in this game - your screen will turn into a black box. Oh joy. It is super unoptimized even though it looks worse than most 20-yo games.\n\nThe loading times are horrendous with a non-SSD game and it wastes much more RAM than it claims to require.\n\nThe user interface feels floaty. There is no polish to it. I could not select axe that I had for some non-explained reason.",

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-03-28)](https://steam/76561198799210569)\nReally fun game, its so easy to just get sucked in doing quests, all with a very pretty map",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-03-28)](https://steam/76561198837373519)\nVery fun to sink time into if you like  laid-back games with strong multiplayer focus. Most of the game is made of fetching things for villagers and building a nice home. Some people might see this as a fetch quest oriented game. I personally enjoy the quest oriented system, the dialouge is so much fun and there's strong worldbuilding to discover alone or with friends. The friendship system requires real work, tied to actual real world time. (one gift an irl day) this is a good incentive to keep coming back. \r\n\r\nKeeping in mind that this is a Beta, I think the following additions would make the game a ton more enjoyable:\r\n\r\n1) The farming system needs some love. Currently, the extent of farming progression is to unlock better tools and about 3 new crops. The system of crops effecting the growth around them is very unique and fun and i just wish there was more to it and hope that  future updates will provide some sort of rare seeds or cross breeding plants ect ect, really  just anything that means i can grow things not found in easily acessible stores.\r\n\r\n2) I dislike the fact that the fashion system is entirely payment focused on microtransactions. if there wasnt a whole character dedicated  to clothing i wouldn't mind, but it makes me sad that there's nothing for me to craft and learn from with Jel like so many other characters. There are so many quests where you help Jel make an article of clothing but you never get to see or equip anything he makes as far as I know. Buying fancy cosmetics is fine, but community clothing would really up the game, if this isn't possible it would still be great to be able to make clothes with your loom, even if they were simple. if this also isn't possible I think everyone would be happy to buy some in-game currency priced outfits from jel's shop.",

You can do whatever you like, WHENEVER you like. Everything feels really open and new, and it's really easy to put time into.",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-03-27)](https://steam/76561199812432448)\nThis game is great if you just want a cozy farming sim. Fishing, bug catching, cooking, hunting, mining, foraging, and farming are all options in this game. The NPC's are fun and have nice individual personalities. I wish there was more to do with the hunting and mining. I feel like they could really dive deeper into the farming side of the game fore sure. I think the prices for the premium cosmetics is actually insane and the only thing I've bought so far is Zeki's daily login bonus. I was interested in getting the premium cosmetics but it's way too expensive for me. I hope to see them add more and more options to the game. Maybe more areas to explore, more characters to meet. Things like that. If you want something cozy and easy to play though then this is a good game for you.",

Tbf I only played 3 hours so maybe it's a good game but every other game like its kind, or games I thought it was like (Sandrock, Stardew, etc. type games) caught me from the get go. This didn't.

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-03-07)](https://steam/76561198151804910)\nFrom what I have played so far, this is a really cute game. Here are the Pros from what I have seen:\n- Relaxing music & Gameplay\n- Interesting characters and a great art direction\n- Fun fishing mechanics\n- Decent crafting mechanics\n- Good character creation.\n\nIt takes out a lot of the stress of other games of its nature that would make your character crash from exhaustion or give you the ability to soft-lock yourself. While I don't care for the multiplayer, it's cool that you can chat and trade with others. Now for the Cons:\n- Controller Support is clunky\n- Minimap is not great\n- Some tutorial directions are odd with their wording.\n\nBut that's really it?

So they want the company to put more effort into the cash shop than the game. Welcome to the realities of the F2P model.\n\nThese same criticisms were made of Fortnite when it launched.  It's gone on to do just fine, and had continued to have a cash shop of cosmetics that don't affect gameplay.  As long as it's strictly cosmetic, I really don't see a problem.  100% of the game (incomplete as it might be) can be experienced with paying a dime.\n\n### Comment ID jwg9fhv with +14 score by [(Pling7, Reddit, 2023-08-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwg9fhv/) (in reply to ID jwg4lqm):\nFortnite was basically fully actualized as a product though. The problem with Palia lies with priorities. Many systems are unrealized and unpolished compared to other games like it (from much smaller studios) yet the cash shop is already up an functioning. It also begs the question, what are their motivations for doing things the way they do them? Is making the game online in itself done just to sell more cosmetics? Are they going to forgo a more interactive pet system in lieu of one where they can sell cosmetic only pets?  \n\n \\- In a game with such few systems cosmetics play a much larger role in motivating a player. The fact that it's open beta only makes the emphasis on MTX items that much more glaring of a problem (because there's basically nothing to work for at some point).\n\n#### Comment ID jwgi277 with +4 score by [(hyrle, Reddit, 2023-08-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwgi277/) (in reply to ID jwg9fhv):\nWhen Fortnite was in beta, it wasn't a finalized product, though.  It had far fewer features than it has now.  It didn't have several of the systems it has now.  It had far fewer game modes.  In fact, it spent years in beta.\n\nI get the concerns over lack of content in Palia.  I even get concerns about cosmetics costing more than people want to pay (let's face it... any price over $0 is going to be more than some people want to pay.)  But it must be remembered this is a recently-opened live service game that's in beta and shouldn't be critiqued as if it's a complete game.  Even the fully-launched Fortnite continues to evolve, and I'm certain Palia will as long as it is profitable enough to keep it going.    And if it's not profitable, then like hundreds of live service games before it, then it'll close shop as so many F2P games have done before.\n\nIt's understandable that some might not like the direction of that evolution - and it's fair to critique that - but I'm just saying the expectations for a beta should be far lower.\n\n### Comment ID jwgxycg with +2 score by [(MeVe90, Reddit, 2023-08-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwgxycg/) (in reply to ID jwg4lqm):\nI'm surprised they didn't launch a battle pass yet\n\n## Comment ID jwik56a with +6 score by [(Eggsysmistress, Reddit, 2023-08-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwik56a/) (in reply to ID 15ss9gg):\ni thought they were an indie studio at first and was like “aww what a cute game. i’m sure they’ll work hard to make it better”. \n\npfft.\n\n## Comment ID jwjkx17 with +3 score by [(magvadis, Reddit, 2023-08-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwjkx17/) (in reply to ID 15ss9gg):\nIndie has to due with being owned by a major game company. \n\nOne 50 million dollar game does not make you major...at all.\n\n### Comment ID jwjlwc7 with +2 score by [(PsyTripper, Reddit, 2023-08-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwjlwc7/) (in reply to ID jwjkx17):\nThanks for clearing that up.

I haven't been able to find a solid answer to this so if anyone has a source I'm genuinely curious.

For a life Sim it lacks basic features, the decorating is nice but you can hardly interact with anything. Especially in town. Benches you can't sit in at all, a tavern where you can't sit eat, drink, nothing. \n\nAnd for an mmo it's like 20 people in a town map, and your alone in your home instance. They could have done a neighborhood like xiv so you can at least see some other houses without having to ask to be invited. \n\nThere is a clothing shop but it only sells clothes for premium currency, all \"basic\" clothes are just unlocked from the start. The shop is basically purely cosmetic as well since you just buy it from the store, from anywhere. \n\nThe character creator is pretty barebones as well, for a fully social game with no other real content besides rp.

It was basicaly Sci-Fi Warcraft, but it didn’t feel as “WoW clone” at all. The World Building was on point and it was all funny and jokes most of the time, but very serious when an important story archs happened. Just a perfect way how to tell a story imho.\n\nGameplay-wise it had everything what you wanted from an OG theme park mmorpg, but in a modern coat. Dungeons, raids, pvp bgs and arenas, ranked modes, awesome housing system, the list goes on. The best part? It released with all of that stuff. No “alpha” bullshit. Except for bugs and tuning, it just felt finished on the release day.\n\nMany people will disagree with me, but it was THE mmorpg for me. I played from start to shut-down and I wish I re-lived it again. My only real problems with the game was the simplified gearing system ( just 1 weapon per class ) and the telegraph spell system just wasn’t right in large scale battles ( most of the ground were just green and red circles and you couldn’t see anything in battlegrounds for example.)\n\n#### Comment ID lbb3stf with +25 score by [(Deadpoetic6, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbb3stf/) (in reply to ID lbb1yz9):\nTheme,  world, music, combat, housing, artstyle\n\n#### Comment ID lbck51e with +6 score by [(aplcdr, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbck51e/) (in reply to ID lbb1yz9):\nClasses were a lot of fun, I liked race design and the housing system is probably the best that there has ever been\n\n#### Comment ID lbbmdjc with +19 score by [(Akhevan, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbbmdjc/) (in reply to ID lbb1yz9):\n> What features did it have or what was so universally enjoyed about it?\n\nThe fact that it closed down.  \n\nIt was plagued by shitty design decisions and everybody largely hated it while it was still running.\n\n#### Comment ID lbbicbf with +31 score by [(BeatDownn, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbbicbf/) (in reply to ID lbb1yz9):\nPeople just want what they can't have.

But it was also filled with hackers (from the East, some in america.) \n\n  \nBut they've also closed over 20 games in their time. (From 1997 to 2018 on the [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daybreak_Game_Company), at least.)\n\nI've been into Palia for some time, threw a couple bucks into the game because I enjoyed supporting the Devs for the inital launch. But if Daybreak is as hands on as they usually are, this game is going to go one of two ways.\n\n  \n1. They stay mostly hands-off, allow S6 team to develop within healthy timeframes and put out content.\n\n2. They grab unto the game with such force and forcefeed it more in store items (P2w items, convience items, premium pass,etc.)\n\n  \nFor now? I can't say for sure, but I am biased in my examination of the situation as Daybreak has been horrible about alot of cashgrab things, not caring for titles, etc. Overall, I hope the S6 team does well enough to support their families and relatives. Because while these are game companies, there are people on the team who don't get a say in what happens.\n\n### Comment ID lbbwt2d with +2 score by [(thystro, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbbwt2d/) (in reply to ID lbbjji2):\nH1Z1 Survive was fking great\n\n#### Comment ID lbc4ksh with +1 score by [(Starbound_Selly, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbc4ksh/) (in reply to ID lbbwt2d):\nIt really was, I made a small group of friends on there.

It basically means pay to not be hindered at every step, otherwise you fall behind everyone else. Monetizing bag slots, adding inventory weight and monetizing that, nerfing xp gains and implementing boosts, storage space, stricter decoration limits etc, etc, etc, you get the picture. Something similar to Black Desert Online would be the route they take.

Taking away that feature would’ve lost them a ton of players as deeds(the activity that earns the store currency) are a very popular thing for many veteran players to work on once they’ve completed the current end game raids and dungeons. Essentially, the MMO saying “the true end game is fashion” is very much based in reality for LOTRO. The feature has basically been grandfathered in throughout the various acquisitions LOTRO has gone through over the years. (source: I’ve been playing LOTRO off and on for over a decade)\n\nPalia, however, is still very new and, as a result, very malleable. I’m trying to remain optimistic, but I won’t be surprised if this acquisition means big changes for Palia and its monetization. Ultimately, though, if it means the game will make it to 1.0 while retaining its heart and soul, I’ll be ecstatic. The S6 devs have created a really solid foundation and I’d love to see what else they have planned.\n\n#### Comment ID lb87gk4 with +16 score by [(AmberRosalie_, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb87gk4/) (in reply to ID lb84smp):\nThey only publish LoTRO though so I’m not sure how much actual involvement they have.

So I had not to spend anything there.\n\nAnd the fee to purchase the Add-ons was really low compared to the original price in points.\n\nIf i remember it correctly, they had giveaway free, 26 Quest packs from different zones, and offer each expansion pack from Moria to Mordor for each 100 points only, while the mordor pack had cost 2500 points.\n\nSure, without that event it had taken more time to get it free, but could still be possible.

I have seen some games under the Daybreak banner flourish and others fail.\n\nIn the official statement released it does say that S6 and the game development will still stay under the current leadership.  This  lends hope that maybe Palia will have some luck similar to LotRO where Daybreak is more of a \"publisher\" than a developer.  \n\nWill we see more monetization?  Of course.  A game has to have a revenue stream somehow to continue support and development.  This would have been coming regardless of the Daybreak acquisition or not.  And if they didn't, then our favorite world would eventually die out.\n\nAll we can do at this point is just wait and see.  Me personally, I'll continue to play just how I've been playing and watch what changes.  If it starts to change for the better, GREAT!  If it starts to go downhill, then I'll just start looking for a new home.\n\n## Comment ID lb9zaxp with +9 score by [(mistar_z, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb9zaxp/) (in reply to ID 1dt7ujt):\nI'm concerned for the employees. I knew that when they did all those big layoffs earlier this year it meant that they're probably planning for a sale or acquisition, to look better on paper . This sadly isn't great news for the remaining employees as acquisitions normally means more layoffs on the horizon as the leadership restructures the company to their new bottom line.\n\n\nBut on the positive side.

There’s always more layoffs on the horizon. They change the company culture. Just experienced an acquisition myself and so many people are quitting bc after layoffs we’re a skeleton crew and they turned the culture so profit driven.\n\nIf anyone thinks the ethics of Palia are going to stay the same- don’t hold your breath. I wouldn’t be surprised if they stayed pushing ads for in game purchases and went in a different direction with art eventually. \n\nWe can’t forget that S6 is a for-profit company. And this acquisition is going to open peoples eyes to that. It’s no shade on S6.

If they were making plenty off of people buying the clothing and just wanting to support the company, there wouldn’t have been layoffs. It sucks, but there’s a reason MMOs don’t follow this monetization model, and it’s not JUST corporate greed.

Daybreak, formerly known as Sony Online Entertainment, launched EverQuest in 1999 and the game is still going.

First, they were part of SISA with which they started developement of EverQuest. Then SOE was made and SISA was renamed into 989 Studios. THEN they went into making PS games, while a branch spun off and formed RedEye Interactive which was then renamed as Verant Interactive.\n\nThen they released EverQuest. Later they were controlled by Sony Pictures which iirc was like, it's grandparent company (Sony Pictures owned SOE which owned Verant), and later in 2015 SOE was sold off to Columbus Nova and Verant changed it's name into Daybreak.\n\nWhich they claim no, they didn't, they were bought by Inception Acquisitions... which was related to Columbus Nova. Which was involved with the Renova Group. Which was... in trouble, to say the least, during 2016. Oh, those russians!\n\nThen in 2018 a mobile game company \"strategically\" invested in Daybreak to port games to mobile... and three rounds of layoffs occurred. Things went awry, it got separated into three teams and then in 2020 they were bought by Enad Global 7. \n\nThey also took over MTG Online in 2022, and it seems they had few layoffs since, with a recent one being of \"less than 15 employees\" from their three branches.\n\nAll that said, S6 may be lucky and have no issues now that Daybreak's situation has changed.\n\n### Comment ID lb9kexf with +4 score by [(h39000, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb9kexf/) (in reply to ID lb8sw64):\nI never had issues w the WoW sub because the game *worked*.

Other than that there is not any news about Daybreak of substance other than they laid off workers in February of this year.\n\nI really want Palia to succeed, I just don't know if Daybreak is the company to make that happen.\n\n## Comment ID lb9j4z2 with +7 score by [(Dahlipop, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb9j4z2/) (in reply to ID 1dt7ujt):\nDoesn’t daybreak love adding a bunch of micro transactions to unlock game features ….. not excited for this .\n\n### Comment ID lb9obtp with +3 score by [(Thesevendaytheory, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb9obtp/) (in reply to ID lb9j4z2):\nOh gosh please no :(\n\n### Comment ID lb9qfhk with +1 score by [(pxmpkxn, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb9qfhk/) (in reply to ID lb9j4z2):\nAnother comment said in a game they purchased they monetized QUESTS.

My old long time gamer husband tells me this isnt a bad thing at all. I trust his judgement on this because all I am seeing is folks getting their underwear twisted over how the company choose to fund the work on the game. Frankly we are lucky to have had a free game which hasnt had anything but skins behind a paywall. So how about a bit of positivity and hope instead? S6 have as far as I can tell in the 4 months of playing, given players practically everything they could do within the game mechanics as it stands.  Wanted plushies? you got them.. wanted trees? got them, wanted flow trees on your plot? you got them! Wanted hotpot back? we got it! Bigger houses? got that too....! S6 have listened and delivered where they can. So enough whining and moaning about their partnership with an established game provider, they can rehire, and hopefully we will see the fruits of this soon! If you dont want to buy into stuff then dont but if you are going to moan about a FREE to play game that is still currently in dev mode then you really need to find something else to do with your life.   \nPersonally I think this is rather exciting for S6, it shows confidence from the industry that Palia is viable for the future.\n\n### Comment ID lbbgeoy with +4 score by [(marchviolet, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lbbgeoy/) (in reply to ID lbasarc):\nMy own longtime gamer husband also had a relatively positive reaction to this news when I shared it with him.

Is it going to end up in maintenance mode soon,or will the money earned from the sale be put into development? Will Devs from other projects come help with Palia, or the other way round?

They are pretty much the exact opposite of what S6 was about when it comes to monetization. The fact S6 was even open to an acquisition in the first place isn't a good sign but if you couple that with them actually going through with it with such a publisher speaks volumes. This one line from the official acquisition statement says it all.\n\n\"It is incredibly exciting to find like-minded partners who share in our commitment to investing in our products and players for the long-term\"\n\nLet's focus on this a little, \"products\" and \"players\". First off, S6 would never refer to the game as a \"product\", so right from the start you know this section wasn't written by them. Secondly, any time a company mentions 2 things under the same context you should always read them separately like this.\n\n\"It is incredibly exciting to find like-minded partners who share in our commitment to investing in our products\"\n\n\"It is incredibly exciting to find like-minded partners who share in our commitment to investing in our players for the long-term\"\n\nRead that last one about players and what does it sound like to you? I'll spell it out for you just in case...we are the product, not the game. They have invested in a new player base that is outside there normal target audience. Whether this is good or bad will remain to be seen but they have an expectation of a return on that investment and with a game like Palia that could be tricky. It costs more to create something new then it does to place artificial limitations on us and people are far more likely to spend money on a better experience then on a prettier one. So like I originally said, hope for the best but prepare for the worst because the odds are not in our favor here by a long shot and it really pains me because I love this game.\n\nEDIT: Somehow the other half of my comment got cut when I posted lol. So here is my optimistic side.\n\nThis DOES have a bright side to it. Investment from a bigger company can be a really good thing. Most of the games under Daydreams publishing are actually good games if you ignore the monetization factor. The world building and lore behind most of them are top notch, but the story writing tends to be a little lack luster. S6 however has great writing and a LOT of lore and world elements to build upon so with Daydreams backing Palia has a lot going for it in a good way.\n\n## Comment ID lb83d6r with +10 score by [(haffasandwitch, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb83d6r/) (in reply to ID 1dt7ujt):\n![gif](giphy|7doqMMIYTH1Zkq9mpY|downsized)\n\n## Comment ID lbbmyo0 with +4 score by [(TwistedReads, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lbbmyo0/) (in reply to ID 1dt7ujt):\nwell. good run everyone see you in the next game!\n\n## Comment ID lbdyjsa with +5 score by [(evaperated, Reddit, 2024-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lbdyjsa/) (in reply to ID 1dt7ujt):\nHonestly I’m a huge fan of the battle pass model, and would welcome something like that in Palia.

They either complain that a one time fee for a game is ‘ridiculously overpriced’ or they complain a completely free to play game DARES to have a cash shop feature.\n\nI’ve bought outfits I like in Palia, and bought the landscapes and a couple pets.

      "# Post ID 1bqq6c8: Palia Dev Update: “we’ll keep our players updated with as much information as possible as we approach what we consider to be our official launch.” with +314 score by [(kyleblane, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/)\n[https://palia.com/news/dev-update-7](https://palia.com/news/dev-update-7)\n\nFull Text (of beta section)\n\n>**Palia is Currently in Open Beta**  \n>  \n>We want to clear the air: since our Open Beta launch back in August 2023, the **game remains as a title still in Open Beta**. Know that we’ll keep our players updated with as much information as possible as we approach what we consider to be our official launch.  \n>  \n>We're aware that there has been feedback regarding our messaging and status on various platforms, but the emphasis is that Palia is free-to-play and available for anyone to try. It is a continuous, ongoing effort, and we are committed to providing patch updates with new content, improvements, and bug fixes well into the future.  \n>  \n>In fact, looking at our version, being on 0.178 means we’ve made over 178 updates to the game! Even from the start, and the days of Pre-Alpha, we made sure to include player feedback and have it shape Palia to be where it is today. And when it’s ready, we also plan to have the versioning update from “0.XXX” to “1.XXX” to better reflect Palia’s new status — but even that is not the end. We’ll keep having more patches after, and developing Palia alongside our players. That was one of the primary reasons why we wanted it to be a free-to-play, live-service game.  \n>  \n>We invite everyone to be part of this journey.\n\nFirst of all, when you need to \"clear the air\" that your game is still in beta you've failed at the most basic communication about your game.\n\nThe bare minimum required to provide \"as much information as possible\" as your game approaches launch is to properly inform players that the game hasn't yet been launched. Steam and Epic versions should be in Early Access. Switch should have some form of \"beta\" mentioned somewhere. The word \"beta\" should exist somewhere on the website other than news updates and the EULA. It's a very easy decision to make, and a very easy change to implement.\n\nThis dev update is void of any definitive action they're going to take. They only say that they are aware of the feedback and are focusing on communicating that the game is free (As if the two messages can't coexist LOL). I hope I'm wrong and this is just a poorly worded update, but I don't expect to see any communication changes regarding the beta status of the game.\n\n## Comment ID kx6h2br with +74 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx6h2br/) (in reply to ID 1bqq6c8):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID kx7hkxm with +16 score by [(OreoYip, Reddit, 2024-03-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx7hkxm/) (in reply to ID kx6h2br):\nI am okay with the conversations but honestly, it is getting a bit old hat.

UI text size sliders - for people who are playing on Steam Deck for example! Brightness sliders - maybe you just prefer your games to not be that bright! And then other accessibility options  include making the temples doable without having to do complicated maneuvers and having to react at exactly the right time etc etc - some disabled players won't be able to fulfill the challenges at all as they are now, but even players who can fulfill the challenges might not want to do this kind of challenge. I personally get super annoyed with all of the temples, as the rest of the game (except for hunting and some bug catching stuff) is way lower stakes and I fucking hate when I have to jump precisely in games. So I'd profit from an option to do this challenge in an easier way, too (and my keyboard and desk would love that too cause I get really angry and frustrated 😅)\n\n### Comment ID kx4dyj4 with +25 score by [(TheSilentTragedy, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx4dyj4/) (in reply to ID kx4914c):\nAlso this. Many of my friends (many of which were active members of the accessibility channel there) were banned the other day for asking questions, one was banned simply because they wanted to know why their mute had persisted longer than it was supposed to (they were muted for an extra hour instead of the original mute time). \n\nTheir mods/devs have admitted that they have a hard time remaining unbiased regarding critic of the game - in my most respectful and honest opinion, the biggest problem they have (in regard to their Discord) is a lack of a well-acting, level-headed moderation team.\n\n#### Comment ID kx4efjj with +27 score by [(kyleblane, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx4efjj/) (in reply to ID kx4dyj4):\nEarlier on Discord I was asking about details regarding this dev update.

I base it on the reviews. But I'm reading this post from the devs and think they are back peddling due to backlash. Honestly, imo it's easier to justify bugs for games in early access. It would be to their advantage to put it under the early access banner. Why they didn't, I don't really understand. People would give them a pass for bugs. \n\nMaybe they should mention at least in the text of the steam store for the game that it's in beta. Not hidden in the announcement.

Please forgive any crappy formatting on mobile.\n\nDecember 2023 Switch update:\nNo mention of Beta anywhere on the Nintendo eshop page. For weeks leading up to the release multiple members in the discord tagged CMs asking for clarification. CMs would conveniently disappear from conversation or straight up ignore the question while responding to other members. Game launches and what’s missing from the splash page on the switch? The beta tag. The excuse then became “oh well Nintendo doesn’t do beta/early access so take it up with them”. Sandrock was quite literally hosting an early access at this time. \n\nFebruary 2024:\nThey announce the steam release. Members point out that the MMO tag has been scrubbed and there’s no mention of the game being in beta. Every week members would be tagging the CMs to ask and get clarification, warning the CMs that this would lead to negative reviews. The CM response was gifs and saying they’d pass it along to the rest of the team. Members also noted that the Palia website had also been scrubbed of the beta label at this time.\n\nBefore this they were telling people they banned for questioning the lack of beta tag that they had no control over what steam labeled the game as and now it’s too late because once a game has been published you can no longer mark it as early access and beta. \n\nI know this doesn’t matter to some people and I think that’s perfectly fine BUT for some of us a company being intentionally deceitful repeatedly is a big red flag. Many of us have played for hundreds of hours, sunk money into the game and built a community with people inside and outside of the game so we’re feeling quite passionate and honestly concerned about the way things are going. \n\nI’d also like to add this is a team that brags about being industry vets, these are people that know what they’re doing and are now trying to handwave all this away with “oh we’re still learning”. This isn’t a small indie team and hell even small indie teams know to mark a game in beta/EA. Honestly this dev update is only in response to the negative feedback there’s not even any mention of accountability, this wording it reads to me like “well it’s free so who cares”. I care! They have a cash shop and yes it’s optional BUT there is still a way for people to spend money on game by a company that is intentionally trying to mislead its player base and I’m sorry but I’m not okay with that.\n\n### Comment ID kx4ktvz with +21 score by [(kyleblane, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx4ktvz/) (in reply to ID kx4k5ml):\nBravo for good formatting on mobile.

I don’t want to yuck other peoples yum lol! I haven’t left a review and try not to speak negatively of the game even in the discord now because I can see it’s bringing a lot of people joy BUT I also feel like it’s causing people to have major blinders on. Singularity 6 talked about wanting to be different and player focused so I wanted to hold them to the standard they set for themselves and see them make a really good game.

Thanks OP for sharing and I completely agree with your take! \n\nThe update from the Palia team comes off defensive and doesn’t have any accountability in the failure to communicate the status of their game. It being free doesn’t negate it from criticism or basic expectations of knowing it isn’t fully launched. \n\nThis honestly makes me want to uninstall.

I've been saying they've been shady since their post about sitting in chairs coming off as more of a \"there. Aren't you guys glad we did this for you? You should be happy we did (the bare minimum) hard work with sit-tech and now you can sit in chairs so stop pestering us.\" Post. (Not the exact quote but it did feel very passive aggressive)\n\nI remember saying that despite this game being free with optional microtransactions, this was going to be one of those barely updated, barely fixed games with barely anything in it worth playing but the store would be absolutely cluttered with new stuff. What happened when I stated that? \n\nDeath threats(yes. I kid you not lmfao) the typical \"It's free. Stop complaining.\", then there were the \"They're taking their time to get it right. If you don't like it don't play it.\" (I stopped around the time they dropped the news that outfits will always be microtransactions) and then people telling me that I was too poor to play the game and I was just a poor hater. Lmao. \n\nWell, despite all those people jumping my butt, I am glad but also disappointed to see that I was mostly right. It's a shame because I hoped they'd take player feedback seriously and make this a game worth sticking around for...but once again, game companies be game company-ing. Glad I didn't hang on to that hope and get let down like I am sure many others have. \n\nI am sorry to those who looked forward to this game being something amazing. Hopefully the game grind loop is enough to keep you playing long enough until a better game comes out for you.

Ideally every game would have a redemption arc like No Mans Sky and Cyberpunk.\n\nIt's exhausting to see casual gamers defend this type of stuff again and again. Sure, they can make their own decisions*, but I thought ignorance was the issue. But it's not, they literally don't care and don't want to care, and... I see this in politics and so many other more important areas that it's just annoying. Companies/whatever are going to keep getting worse because people will keep buying/voting the same way because they just don't care. Worse, they'll shut you down so they can keep living in ignorance.\n\nI get that this seems a bit dramatic, it's just a game, but... eh. It's a pattern. Dystopian Sci-Fi writers don't see the future, they recognize a pattern.\n\n\n*Saying this, because if I didn't, they'd say that it's their right to think so.

We have been asking the devs to be honest about this for months, and now they're bold enough to say \"**we’ll keep our players updated with as much information as possible**\" but they can't even clearly communicate the game's beta status in the most basic, expected places.\n\nTo add insult to injury, Switch players are NEVER told the game is in beta but still offered premium items. You're worried about functional changes to the game and I'm worried about a developer intentionally misleading customers.\n\nI have yet to hear a good reason to not mention beta in all of the storefronts, and use Steam and Epic's Early Access label.

No. Is it done? No. There are bugs and glitches but for me that was expected and as someone who is not active on the discord or subreddits it feels like people are overly pissed off about the game and being kinda dickheads to the devs. \n\nIf you don't like it or don't like the devs or don't like their communication, then don't play it!

You seem more dismissive, then interested, in learning why this could be important. I'm not the best at this topic, but-\n\n> If you don't like it or don't like the devs or don't like their communication, then don't play it! No one is holding a gun to your head forcing you to play or talk about it lmfao\n\nIs a terrible stance to take about this type of stuff. I know you'll probably say \"It's just a game\" but it's important to talk about how companies conduct themselves. \n\nMicrotransactions and other unsavoury tactics like that flourish when people dismiss them as \"Just cosmetics, game is still free.\" Despite games like this specifically attempting to make you spend your money on cosmetics (20$ for a digital outfit). When other companies notice there's a way to squeeze more money out of you, they'll start engaging in worse tactics, making levels specifically harder so you cave and buy more lives just to play the games. Or specifically making the feedback loop more addictive, or making it easier for children who aren't as aware of these tactics to buy things. \n\nYou could say \"It's the parent's job to prevent that\" But we have laws specifically to make dangerous/addictive things regulated, because we understand that the average person might not be educated enough to avoid them.\n\nI don't know if palia specifically falls into this category. But being open about EA is also important. When Disney Dreamlight came out, people bought the full game for 60$, because they specifically hid the fact that it is EA and the full game will release for free later. You're specifically buying to play earlier. It seems small, but the more stuff like that gets hidden as \"Not a big deal\" The more companies will continue to shift around things that they KNOW people want to know, and hide it because if a person did know, they wouldn't have bought/played it. You have a right to know what you are investing (Time, money, etc.) in.\n\nLying by omission, if not called out, is encouraged. You can get games who have been funded by millions only for all the news to be wiffle waffled on. And this keeps happening, because we don't talk about Early Access and the cons with it enough. Because casual gamers don't normally keep up with the news enough to see a pattern and think it's just a fluke that dumb people fell for. That they're smart and will never fall for similar predatory tactics.\n\nWhile people are supposed to make informed discissions, we also have to acknowledge that in the age of overinformation, it's not possible. If the only way to know if something is EA is by going on Twitter, or any other completely unrelated social network, you messed up! Transparency is the most important thing that can be done. If you can only tell it's a beta by seeing 0.2.4.5 version, it's not transparent, it means that people have to be tech savvy enough to understand what section of a version code means it's beta or finished.\n\nI also found from that experience a lot of casual gamers, who admit that this was their only game, didn't really understand a lot of game mechanics. Why having to spend 6+ hours mining rocks to make a basic decoration wasn't an acceptable grind, because they enjoyed doing mindless activities for 6 hours! Don't like it? Don't play it! We didn't, but before we left we decided it was worth explaining why, from our experience of MMO's gone bad, it's a sign on the wall.\n\nWhy having constant bugs and patches introduce more bugs, from experience in EA gone bad, were signs on the walls. \"All games have bugs, jeez\"\n\nWhy having the first microtransaction, from experience in mobile games, were signs on the wall. \"It's just clothing, don't like it? Don't buy it!\" despite a single chair being 20$ \"You don't need it\" Despite more things getting locked further and further, keeping an intentional cycle on FOMO.\n\nThey mostly subscribed to the same philosophy of \"It's free, and I got a lot of content out of it, so who cares about [microtransactions], [terrible dev communication], [terrible grinding mechanics]\" Which is fine, but they also refused to allow others to put in their two pence. Saying \"You're being toxic\" or \"Bringing down the mood\" or \"Why does everyone always have to complain, don't like it, don't play it!\" As if we can't have a discussion on anything but positive things. \n\nI think they see a lot of people, and forget that those individuals don't see others complaints are a part of their own, so instead of one person sharing one problem, it's hundreds sharing that one problem. Making it seem much more dramatic then it is for those people individually. I will admit some people take things too far, especially if the dev starts shutting down any mild conversations, extreme ones start surfacing.\n\nIf you've played video games for decades, you start seeing the same patterns that ruined other companies and games. You start recognizing the trend that gaming is going down.\n\nWe don't play it, but we also learned that boycotting doesn't work and companies will still cut as many corners while getting as much money as possible. We still feel like we should talk about it, at the very least, even if most people just shrug their shoulders and say \"Who cares? I still had fun.\"\n\nSorry, turned long and probably isn't as coherent as I'd like it to be.\n\n#### Comment ID kx5swdt with +7 score by [(ControlledEuphoria, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx5swdt/) (in reply to ID kx4o2h6):\nJust had to say I thought this was incredibly well thought out and perfectly coherent! I agree so much about transparency especially when it comes to beta/EA. I’m considering supporting Farmfolks even though they had a disaster of a first kickstarter based solely on the fact that the new team has been putting out consistent clear messaging. It’s so important we all do our part to try to keep companies accountable so that the beta/ea tag doesn’t immediately tank a game. Especially in the farming/cozy game community because a lot of these games get picked up by people that can’t or don’t have the time to spend navigating discords/reddits/steam forums to learn that the game they just downloaded is incomplete/has issues.

      "# Post ID 15qc2j1: The moderation and community on Discord are TERRIBLE. with +103 score by [(BrettGrell, Reddit, 2023-08-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15qc2j1/the_moderation_and_community_on_discord_are/)\nAs if the lackluster state of the beta was not enough, Palia's discord is among the worst communities I have ever been a part of. The culture of \"inclusivity and coziness\" they are trying to cultivate has failed, and it has failed miserably. A big part of this the fault of the way their discord is moderated. I want to be very clear that I'm not trying to bash the moderators as people, but as moderators, they are terrible at what they do. \n\nThere was a discussion in the discord today about non-English speaking members of their community and how they are unable to advertise or speak in their native language. This is something I am very passionate about. I completely understand that it is an arduous task moderating multiple languages, and it is okay to not have the resources for that *at this time.* However, not having an outlet to direct non-English speaking members is completely unacceptable. The posts in the channel where people advertise their communities and the discords associated with them are *not able to be editted.* Why can a moderator not run the post through google translate once it is up to make sure it says nothing nefarious, and then people that come in speaking that language can be directed to that post? The shoddy translation for other languages in this game looks as if it has been run through google translate, so why are you unable to do it for community posts just once? It blows my mind.\n\nMultiple members of the Singularity 6 defense force then decided to tell me that \"moderators are volunteers.\" This has been declared multiple times by community managers that this is not the case. They are paid professional moderators. Even after showing the quote directly from said community manager, members were jumping through hoops to defend this development studio that can supposedly do no wrong. \"Just because they are not professionals does not mean they are paid,\" one stated, when it has been said explicitly, multiple times that being a moderator is a professional, **paid** role. In the middle of this disagreement, a moderator was coming in and reminding everyone \"to please keep it friendly!\" You know what would have instantly settled the conversation? **By telling them that moderation is a paid role.** Rather than just saying that and settling this disagreement like a sensible person, they let the conversation persist, and warn/ban other people saying that moderation was a paid role. Is this a secret?? Are we not supposed to know that? The way Singularity 6 tries to control every narrative and every conversation about their game is truly concerning. I would not be surprised if they find reason to lock this thread.\n\nIt has been shown multiple times in the discord that innocuous arguments and comments are treated more harshly than bigotry and dogwhistles. We have watched transphobic people have their messages removed, but not be banned or muted. How is that cozy? \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15onv0k/about\\_the\\_discordpost\\_was\\_removed\\_revising\\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15onv0k/about_the_discordpost_was_removed_revising_and/)\n\nI have been a member of the community for years, and been very passionate about wanting this game to go in the right direction. The staff at Singularity6 and the moderators in the discord have proven that this game and its community is not what it has been advertised as. It is heartbreaking watching Palia fall even further from grace. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Comment ID jw2cve5 with +101 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-08-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15qc2j1/the_moderation_and_community_on_discord_are/jw2cve5/) (in reply to ID 15qc2j1):\nBecause feedback ✨doesn’t matter✨ and it doesn’t help the ✨game✨ /s\n\n### Comment ID jw2l8gc with +46 score by [(Temporary_Lawyer_938, Reddit, 2023-08-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15qc2j1/the_moderation_and_community_on_discord_are/jw2l8gc/) (in reply to ID jw2cve5):\nThey removed the recently highly upvoted topic about the issues with discord under the \"rule 6-respect the devs\" rule.

There seems to be no criticism allowed. People are still in a honeymoon state with the game it seems and I think alot of people soon will realize, that the game in its current state is still very empty. I try to love the game. I really do. When I first heard of Palia, I was thinking, that this is the game I ll play for years, as it pretty much includes everything I want in a game and then its even an MMO. Or atleast thats how they advertised the game. What concerns me the most, is that the game hasnt really made any progress in the last 2 years according to some alpha and pre alpha players I met on my journey so far. So I wonder how much progress to the game we will see in the future. They already made their money with the kickstarter campaign and I doubt that a purely cosmetic shop will bring in enough revenue for them to not abandon the game in the near future. Whats also sending redflags to me, is how often I read on the discord, that S6 consists of ex Riot, Blizzard and other big player employees. The code of the game is pretty much spaghetti. There is no server side validation on alot of things. In public cheating communities they already found ways to get premium outfits, duplicate items, get unlimited money/renown etc. which clearly should not be possible, if you have a team full of veteran developers from the biggest mmo's in history.\n\n### Comment ID jw49hfv with +11 score by [(RexZShadow, Reddit, 2023-08-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15qc2j1/the_moderation_and_community_on_discord_are/jw49hfv/) (in reply to ID jw3u3tf):\n>They already made their money with the kickstarter campaign\n\nAs fyi they did not do a kickstarter.

And most likely this was the promised launch date when they did the pitch to the investors.\n\nWell being from Riot and Blizzard means nothing really beside marketing pitch. Its like what were their job at Riot and Blizzard? If they were all junior devs there incharge of small tasks then it means jack shit. How many of them were in lead role making big decision or solving difficult tech issues? There not many of those on a team and those are the people that would matter when you say from Riot or Blizzard.\n\nOne pitfall of huge development teams is everyone get too specialized and that experience is hard to translate to new projects. I know Riot is well know for this where they have so many people and everyone is so specialized on what they do.\n\n## Comment ID jw2kx5g with +45 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-08-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15qc2j1/the_moderation_and_community_on_discord_are/jw2kx5g/) (in reply to ID 15qc2j1):\nMeh let the mods be shills and let S6 ignore the feedback that actually needs reading.\n\nWatch it bite them in the ass down the road.\n\n### Comment ID jw3k379 with +14 score by [(ExNihiloNihiFit, Reddit, 2023-08-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15qc2j1/the_moderation_and_community_on_discord_are/jw3k379/) (in reply to ID jw2kx5g):\nExactly!

      "# Post ID 18ewr01: The Temple of Gales vs Disabled Palia Players with +92 score by [(peppermintblue, Reddit, 2023-12-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/)\nIn the September 2023 Dev Update (found at [https://palia.com/news/dev-update-september-2023](https://palia.com/news/dev-update-september-2023)), the following was stated in regards to the obstacle course: *\"Because we don’t want people to feel like this is an experience they have to participate in, we have not put any unique rewards behind completing it that a cozy gamer would feel like they absolutely had to have. E.g. There is no unique plushie locked behind completing this activity. Completing the course is more about earning a sense of accomplishment and being able to show that off than any other reward.\"*\n\nHowever, now in December 2023, they have released the Temple of Gales which is.... the tower in different packaging with both main storyline and unique rewards locked behind it (and like the tower, there are no save points).  \\[edit: you have to complete the temple to unlock the vault bundles which are what actually gives you the unique rewards.\\]\n\nWith the understanding that Singularity6 is not looking at Reddit for feedback, what are your thoughts on this?\n\nPersonally, one of my medical conditions effects my occipital nerve and one of the symptoms is... vertigo.  While it's manageable in Kilima and Bahari, it's not manageable in The Tower or in the Temple of Gales.  I highly suspect it's because those places are in a void where you cannot see the ground/water to help you judge any kind of distance. Just use the persistent center triangle you say? Doesn't work even a tiny bit.  Well what about the adjusting the field of view?  Also does not work, and I have to reinstall my game after any adjustment to it because any change to the field of few results in weirdly unproportionate squished things.Aside from myself, I have seen people taking about being unable to do the Temple of Gales due to  hand problems (Arthritis & Fibromyalgia) as well as due to the in-game instructions not being clear enough for people with cognitive issues (Multiple Sclerosis, Fibromyalgia, and medication side-effects).\n\nI know there were a lot of people, including myself, who submitted feedback to the devs via [support.palia.com](https://support.palia.com) \\> requests > Palia feedback and choosing the accessibility dropdown regarding this when The Tower was released so they could better understand the nature of disabilities that would lock people out of areas such as these... and I won't speak for everyone of course, but from what I am seeing being said, there's a good contingent of the disabled Palia community that is feeling lied to right now.\n\nOf course, rarely will a company ever be perfect in their inclusivity!  However, Palia is doing exactly what they said they would NOT do:  putting unique rewards & storyline behind an area that \\[edit: ~~not everyone can participate in.~~   is like The Tower.  However, my having a disability that is directly challenged by this tower-like new temple is clouding my thoughts on the issue, which is why I'm looking for thoughts on the matter. /edit  -- edit of the edit: Yep, I know that makes the title of the post a little click-baity, but I can't edit it now... sorry not sorry.\\]\n\n## Comment ID kcrxvoa with +21 score by [(Unit-Fickle, Reddit, 2023-12-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kcrxvoa/) (in reply to ID 18ewr01):\nI haven’t played for a few days.

I've never really used a handheld gaming device (smart phone not being counting as a gaming device) before... who knows.  \n\n\n\\--- The following is being copy & pasted into many replies ---  \nThis is an accessibility feedback that I'm submitting right now.  Used other in the choices for accessibility issue feedback:\n\n***General Accessibility Issues***   \n*I couldn't pick just one item off of the list of accessibility because it touches all of them.  There's a pretty extensive Reddit thread about the game that you should probably be aware of, and could likely learn a lot from.*  [*https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the\\_temple\\_of\\_gales\\_vs\\_disabled\\_palia\\_players/?sort=top*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/?sort=top) \n\n*And what it all boils down to is this: Palia has fundamental accessibility problem.  From the lack of colour blindness settings to unique items & main questline being locked behind temples that aren't disability friendly.*     \n*The Palia Code of Conduct (*[*https://palia.com/code-of-conduct*](https://palia.com/code-of-conduct)*)  has the players promise not to be ableist, but the game itself is not meeting that standard as an example.*  *\"According to the World Health Organization, 15% of the world’s population (an estimated 1.1 billion people) identify as having some form of disability. This represents the world’s largest minority, and the only minority group that any of us can become a member of at any time.\"  -* [*https://easterseals.ca/en/disability-in-canada-facts-figures/*](https://easterseals.ca/en/disability-in-canada-facts-figures/) \n\n *Are you willing to loose 15% of your current players, or 15% less of the people you could have playing this amazing game?  Because that's what you may be staring down the barrel of.*  \n *Disabled people do buy premium items.  When we spend a lot of time at home, we do our best to  make the time we spend there as enjoyable as we can.  I love Palia and have bought 3 outfits and a glider skin so far, and I wanted to buy more... but right now my progress in the main storyline is halted because of a lack of an accessibility option...  so why would I buy more?*\n\n *I sincerely beg of you to improve the accessibility options in Palia. Open a better dialogue with disabled players. There are very simple solutions that will make this game an even more beloved experience.*  \n\n*Thank you.* \n\nWe should be flooding their feedback forums. Make more noise.  We shouldn't have to do this, but if we want to be included in this game we may need to do this.   Feel free to copy my feedback if you're not up to writing you own, but you should include your personal experience on one of the specific accessibility issues feedback choices in any capacity you feel you can.\n\n## Comment ID kcqya9n with +31 score by [(RelikaNox, Reddit, 2023-12-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kcqya9n/) (in reply to ID 18ewr01):\nWhen it comes to Palia and accessibility issues, part of me immediately recommends the accessibility discussion channel on the discord... But then, at the same time, I can't in good conscience even do that because it's immediately advertised as not being looked at in the least by the devs.\n\nWorth a good discussion with others that you likely won't get here or on most other channels on the discord, but yeah, it's rough. There's a lot of people who don't realize that accessibility is part of being inclusive. And I can already see that with a quick scroll down in the replies here.\n\nIt might help, at least, to talk to people in the same situation on that channel on the discord, despite the whole issue where they're not...really looking. I know that kinda sounds counterproductive, but better than here rn.\n\n### Comment ID kcr1vnz with +9 score by [(peppermintblue, Reddit, 2023-12-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kcr1vnz/) (in reply to ID kcqya9n):\nTaking to others on that discord channel is what inspired me to make the post here actually.  I want to hear from both able-bodied players and players with disabilities... because it's also just a discussion regarding expectations in relation to promises made by development teams.     \n\n\nSo far I feel like the discussion here on reddit is going better than I expected.  The upvote ratio on the main post isn't great... but I did put the word disability in the title, which is enough for many people to downvote on alone.   A couple of discussions even lead me, very quickly, into ways to implement alternatives to a couple of different things that could be implemented via the lore.  So valuable discussion regardless of any intent behind it.\n\n#### Comment ID kcss73x with +2 score by [(RelikaNox, Reddit, 2023-12-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kcss73x/) (in reply to ID kcr1vnz):\nLegit!

Couldn't even finish it because of the climbing bugs. \n\nWhile I agree that they should not remove the quests or completely change them, they could implement some accessibility options that players could choose to enable if they need them.\n\n### Comment ID kcrcf44 with +26 score by [(xSeraiX, Reddit, 2023-12-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kcrcf44/) (in reply to ID kcqznlg):\nHi, also ADHD here. The new temple was... Really frustrating. I'm the type of person that, once I hyperfixiate on something I HAVE to finish it, but the game itself makes it such a frustrating experience 😭\n\nThere's no mini map. This is already a problem in the open world, but in the temple it was even worse! Yes you get used to it after hours of being stuck there, but I still have problems with getting around, cuz my brain has the memory of a fly. A mini map would REALLY help. We can't even open up a map here under M!\n\nSome stuff isn't explained well or thought out well.\nGetting the evidence for Caleri and Elouisa was really frustrating! While it does check off that you found them, if you're stuck with, let's say two missing for each and being lost in this huge place, you will lose track of whivh you already have unlocked... Maybe after a while there should be hints on where to find the last ones. Or maybe there should be indicators for which you have already found!\nI found myself running to the same ones because I kept forgetting which was for who... I ended up having to use help from the discord (there was this lovely person taking screenshots of the locations, thank you!).\n\nSome of the objects for Zeki's treasure hunt are at awful places (like the gold chapaa figure). It's especially frustrating when the climbing, which is already pretty bugged on the normal map, doesn't work well in the temple at all. Personally I didn't have those huge climbing bugs like others did, thankfully, but the experience itself is not great :( climbing was not really smooth. Sometimes you fall down, slide down, get stuck or invisible walls... Etc etc.\n\nWhile I did have fun the first hour I was playing (in itself I think the temple would be a fun experience), all those frustrating bits keep piling up and make it... Not fun. It wouldn't register the last Elouisa evidence for me so I had to relog, which helped but it kicked me out of the temple and straight to Bahari central stables.. I had to run all the way back 😭\n\nI can't even imagine how this experience must be for someone with a disability. I really hope they can work on this!\n\n#### Comment ID keq0vq0 with +4 score by [(StunningEducation982, Reddit, 2023-12-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/keq0vq0/) (in reply to ID kcrcf44):\nI'm the same way. I also have adhd and hyperfixate and the lack of mini maps is an absolute hell I can't express. \nAnd I'm not sure if this is just a part of the adhd, but sometimes I feel like I have mild dyslexia so I prefer when devs do immersive tutorializing and *showing* the player where to go rather than text tutorials (like in the fire temple where it's mostly visual cues), because I tend to mix up the words anyway.\n\nI tend to like to try finding everything on my own but it was wholly impossible for me. And after watching a YouTube walk-through, I know for sure I would have never found all of the eggs or treasures just based on some of the locations being a sort of \"stand here and turn the camera this way\" optical illusion. Yeah. I have not the patience nor the attention span for that. And my adhd symptoms are compiled with Toddler Mom brain at that 😂 \n\nI think this temple was clever, but maybe not very intuitive\n\n### Comment ID kcr2qgu with +5 score by [(peppermintblue, Reddit, 2023-12-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kcr2qgu/) (in reply to ID kcqznlg):\nYea, buy the time I got through the dialogue for the instructions... I couldn't remember anything beyond finding eggs.  I don't have an ADHD diagnosis yet (did you know that birth control pills mask it? I went off them earlier this year after taking them for over 20 years....  yea.... things are rough right now.... lol), but I absolutely feel what you are saying here.   Only difference for me is that the vertigo is the more immediate problem as I can't look for those eggs when I can't even get off the 1st island.    \n\n\nThere absolutely needs to be be a way to revisit the instructions.  A map would be nice because I could maybe be able to look at my navigation bar at the marker for where I'm going to and how many feet. I could concentrate on that, I like I do when I'm cliff diving in Bahari, rather than on the void and falling.\n\n#### Comment ID kcsotu7 with +4 score by [(GimcrackCacoethes, Reddit, 2023-12-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kcsotu7/) (in reply to ID kcr2qgu):\n\"Did you know that birth control pills mask it?\"\n\nWait, wut?

It did not explain really what we are supposed to be doing, and then I get to the end and I suddenly had quests I didn't really know I was doing in the background of the main egg quest. And now I'm procrastinating going back to find the other things because there is nothing in game telling us where we might be able to find all of these hidden and hard to see items. I will have to scour every inch of those islands to find everything and it feels like a chore.\n\nOther quests do this, too. The language in a lot of dialogues that give you a quest are not very clear. I've had to sort of guess at some things. I did not even know until I went back to them that the statues gave you things for renown. The game does not give us much in the way of telling us what is even going on. Maybe they could make the journal entries for quests way more specific to avoid the immersive dialog.\n\n### Comment ID kcuosl6 with +5 score by [(peppermintblue, Reddit, 2023-12-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kcuosl6/) (in reply to ID kcsribs):\nThe wiki, playthroughs, and asking chat quickly became my friends when it came to doing most of the quests.

My boyfriend, lucky for him, never faced any difficulty climbing, but, I was being stubborn and continued to try, but after a few moments, it was \\*not\\* going to end well. So, I had to call it a day. After they fixed that, I was still having trouble, due to trying to find the books, the treasures, the eggs. There's so much, scattered around \\*so many far flung spaces\\*. No minimap, or even a regular map. Even using guides, you have to watch the guide through, because if something is skipped, you have no idea \\*where\\* a spot is, if they're in a different spot than you are. The area is so darned large, and a lot of spots look so similar. It's also entirely \\*too easy\\* to fall and be sent back to square one... Over, and over, and over.\n\nMy boyfriend got in done in a couple hours, at most. I've been at it for... Six hours, now, I think? Probably more. From yesterday, and today. And I still have one book to find, three treasures, and the final island to explore. I'm taking a break from it because my frustration was getting the best of me, and my body just can't take that.\n\nI am a FFXIV player, who does use accessibility options and I do have friends help me (such as turning off spell effects, having call outs , etc), so I'm used to knocking my head against a wall.

I've been here at least a couple hours, and it stopped being fun. For me, the biggest pain point is the lack of a map to keep track of where I've not been yet, and a lack of tracking where I did find things, so I can quit looking there.

Well, not glad you also struggle, but glad it's not *just* me. It got slightly better for me after one of the recent patches (now I miss about 1 catch in 3 or 4 instead of every other catch), but it's still a struggle to catch many fish... even with the best rod and health boosters on top. Especially the ones with super sudden, unpredictable patterns of movement. Fish that I've seen often and have slower movements I can anticipate a little, but for the other fish... I do *not* have the processing speed or motor coordination to, all at the same time, parse that *and* move the mouse around *and* long-click/release accordingly, for the length of time it takes to reel the fish in. Already submitted feedback to the devs about this exact thing a while back. It's really turned me off of fishing -- My partner loves to go fish for fun, I fish whenever I see a bubble spot on my other errands and ignore it the rest of the time.

If you fall whatever number of  times the option to talk to him about coming up with another way becomes available. You get locked out of the tower for a few palian days while he looks for a solution, and eventually you do a quest to pick up a flow-powered motor of some kind that he puts on your gilder when you meet him back at the temple.  You zip over to whatever without having to parkour.  the motor conveniently breaks right after you you finish turning in all the quest items (so you better find any hidden chests first).   \n\n\n\\--- The following is being copy & pasted into many replies ---  \nThis is an accessibility feedback that I'm submitting right now.

There are so many quests in this game that I feel are really limiting. Like I don't think I'll ever meet the new npc. I can't cook to save my life so cooking the 3 recipes needed to meet her is impossible for me and doing them in a party is not comfortable either for me due to my schizoaffective disorder.

I'm somewhat lucky in the fact that I used to LOVE really hard platforming games (Super Meat Boy, Celeste, etc), so I kind of have that going for me with stuff like this. I still enjoy those sorts of games, but they're harder to do now with the carpal tunnel syndrome. I've still only gotten to just before the end of the third level of The Tower because of it. I'm hoping it's easier to maneuver on the Switch. I opted to just stop trying in the meantime, because it was really stressing me out.\n\nI found that I didn't struggle with the platforming or getting around the temple once they fixed the climbing issue, but I absolutely did have to look up guides to find some of the evidence I was missing for Caleri and a couple of the treasures. I really enjoyed the temple and thought it was beautiful to look at, but it was really easy to get turned around. I hadn't really thought about it until this thread, but I use the wiki CONSTANTLY, because some of that information isn't easily accessible in the game. \n\nFor example, once you catch a bug/fish, it would be helpful to have an in-game almanac that tells you where/when to find it and what bait to use. It would also be nice if the NPC profiles showed you their general likes as well. I like that the weekly favorite items aren't known until you are close enough with them to ask them about it, because that feels realistic to me, and those DO show up in the NPC profiles once you find out what they are. Having stuff to refer back to later, and having more thoroughly explained quest steps would be really helpful, I think. I never really thought about just how often I use the wiki, and that I probably shouldn't have to. That said, I used the wiki with Stardew a fair bit too, particularly for remembering gifts the NPCs liked. I guess I'm just used to using a wiki or guides for most games. I hadn't really considered that it was an accessibility issue, but it's definitely related to my ADHD.\n\nWith regards to general difficulty, I actually really like how Stardew handles fishing. It kind of sucks initially, but as you catch more basic fish and level the skill, not only do you get better equipment, but the actual fishing mechanic gets NOTICEABLY easier. By the time you hit level 10, it's so much more manageable. I don't know that S6 is planning to have any kind of level cap on skills, but given that you get trophies at 25 and 50, I think those milestones would be a good time to implement some kind of buff that slows the fish down and makes them easier to catch, kind of like how sticky smoke bombs slow down bugs. \n\nLike, it makes sense for there to still be at least a little challenge for rarer fish, but some kind of level-based ability to make it easier would be really helpful, especially for people who struggle with the mechanic. I know there are items you can equip with effects that can help with that, but you can only equip one at a time, and sometimes it's more than one issue making the fishing difficult. Like, if you could get a permanent buff that increases both rod health and safe zone size, it would make a big difference, I think.\n\nSpeaking of fishing, is anyone else having the glitch where the reticle is just... Gone? It's not showing up for me, so I've just been trying to match the fish's movements as much as possible, and I keep losing really easy fish, when I can normally catch rare/epic ones without too much stress. It's getting really frustrating. 🙃 I'll have to see if it's on the known issues list and submit a ticket if it's not.\n\n### Comment ID kcz5r8w with +3 score by [(fembecca, Reddit, 2023-12-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kcz5r8w/) (in reply to ID kcuz11q):\nI have that bug, but not all the time.

I have rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, panic disorder, general anxiety, and depression. I also get vertigo really badly from temple situations. Mind you, there's more going on with me. But these are the things that most affect game play for me. I've been using an Xbox One controller to play because keyboard and mouse is simply too difficult to control. I think this makes it a bit easier to manage. But not by much. My hands don't work properly because of the RA and psoriasis. I flat out can't finish this temple. The movements required are too much for me. My anxiety flares up badly too. I had to take my emergency meds on top of my daily meds just to not have a panic attack. Then I feel like a failure because it's something my brain tells me I should be able to do. Which is where the depression comes into play. I'm a mess over this temple. The ables just don't get it.  \n\n\nI get that most solutions that would work for us would suck for the ables. They're the majority so devs always cater to them. Since this is a community minded game, I feel there is an easy solution that wouldn't completely exclude us. If there was a way to \"hire\" an adventurer to run the temple for you. Similar to asking the community for gifts. They get a reward for assisting, we get the temple rewards. Yes I know, this isn't exactly the win we deserve. But it would be a way to get the rewards without having to deal with the headache. I'm at the point in my life where I'm willing to take the small wins where I can get them. Even if it isn't the prize I really want.\n\n### Comment ID kczj8po with +3 score by [(peppermintblue, Reddit, 2023-12-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kczj8po/) (in reply to ID kcy6t0l):\nI have been diagnosed with occipital neuralgia (permanent), trigeminal neuralgia (transient), fibromyalgia  (permanent), and mixed migraines  (permanent)... I'll be working on getting diagnoses in the new year for possible ADD/ADHD (self-test positive), ASD (self-test positive), and CPTSD... so I may not have those exact disorders, or could have false-positive self-tests.  I wanted to share that with you because of your openness about your diagnoses.  <3\n\nI feel absolutely everything you said in your reply.  The feeling like a failure part really resonates with me... I'm just lucky that I'm really good at telling myself that it's a game and this game should not make me feel like a failure because it's supposed to be accessible -- they said it was inclusive. And then having that spin me into a hyper-obsessive advocacy campaign.   At least I am legitimately enjoying the discussion that my post is generating. \n\nThings that make the game accessible for us don't have to suck for the able-bodied.  There can be a small prize for doing it the hard way, because I totally accept that for me to complete certain things in the game is by doing it the \"easy\" way.   If you do it the hard way, reward that with a relatively inconsequential item. I suggest Zeki coins.  They are bought at a high gold cost, but sell for an extremely low amount.  As well, they can get you either a reward that's high value (furniture/plushie), but they can also give you something absolutely useless (non-flare fireworks). \n\nI love your idea of including some kind of system that rewards assisting!  It would really help build the Palia community's multiplayer aspect.  Perhaps some kind of merit points rewarded when you share a resource with other people, and those points could be redeemed for something like...

And I know it's unrealistic to cater to every single disability... but they could do so many little things to make the accessibility so much better.  Other top games of the same genre are surpassing them by leaps and bounds in accessibility!  Look at Coral Island or My Time at Sandrock.

I definitely go use those if I'm stuck.  I am very hopeful they are working on accessibility options in the background as well, but they need to be more transparent about it if they are.\n\n\\--- The following is being copy & pasted into many replies ---  \nThis is an accessibility feedback that I'm submitting right now.  Used other in the choices for accessibility issue feedback:\n\n***General Accessibility Issues***   \n*I couldn't pick just one item off of the list of accessibility because it touches all of them.  There's a pretty extensive Reddit thread about the game that you should probably be aware of, and could likely learn a lot from.*  [*https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the\\_temple\\_of\\_gales\\_vs\\_disabled\\_palia\\_players/?sort=top*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/?sort=top) \n\n*And what it all boils down to is this: Palia has fundamental accessibility problem.  From the lack of colour blindness settings to unique items & main questline being locked behind temples that aren't disability friendly.*     \n*The Palia Code of Conduct (*[*https://palia.com/code-of-conduct*](https://palia.com/code-of-conduct)*)  has the players promise not to be ableist, but the game itself is not meeting that standard as an example.*  *\"According to the World Health Organization, 15% of the world’s population (an estimated 1.1 billion people) identify as having some form of disability. This represents the world’s largest minority, and the only minority group that any of us can become a member of at any time.\"  -* [*https://easterseals.ca/en/disability-in-canada-facts-figures/*](https://easterseals.ca/en/disability-in-canada-facts-figures/) \n\n *Are you willing to loose 15% of your current players, or 15% less of the people you could have playing this amazing game?  Because that's what you may be staring down the barrel of.*  \n *Disabled people do buy premium items.  When we spend a lot of time at home, we do our best to  make the time we spend there as enjoyable as we can.  I love Palia and have bought 3 outfits and a glider skin so far, and I wanted to buy more... but right now my progress in the main storyline is halted because of a lack of an accessibility option...  so why would I buy more?*\n\n *I sincerely beg of you to improve the accessibility options in Palia. Open a better dialogue with disabled players. There are very simple solutions that will make this game an even more beloved experience.*  \n\n*Thank you.* \n\nWe should be flooding their feedback forums. Make more noise.  We shouldn't have to do this, but if we want to be included in this game we may need to do this.   Feel free to copy my feedback if you're not up to writing you own, but you should include your personal experience on one of the specific accessibility issues feedback choices in any capacity you feel you can.\n\n#### Comment ID kcuiz58 with +5 score by [(Kitannia-Moonshadow, Reddit, 2023-12-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kcuiz58/) (in reply to ID kcuhju3):\nAgree completely.

I didn't even know that I was suppose to turn on the teleport for the other characters until I had completed half the temple, meaning I had to go back to it and do stuff. Not a huge thing but it was frustrating. I luckily haven't really experienced a lot of bugs with climbing, but I do know that for some people it's unplayable because of them. \n\nI do want to ask, as I haven't finished it quite yet as I still have things to find, what unique rewards are there? All I've found are >!treasure chests and the items to give to zeki!<none of which are unique? (perhaps I'm misunderstanding what you mean by unique?) I do get the story aspect though. It's not a deep-dive into lore or anything, but it's still interesting story I wish was accessible without looking it up.\n\n### Comment ID kcrg5st with +6 score by [(peppermintblue, Reddit, 2023-12-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kcrg5st/) (in reply to ID kcra420):\nYou can't complete the vault without completing the temple first.

I understand that is not the case for people with disabilities but if the game was adjusted for possible disabilities it would probably not be very fun for the average player. I hope you find a way to beat the temple of the gales despite your disability.

Would be frustrating for the one who doesn'tget the progress, right? And for the ones who cleared it to do it all again might be exhausting, too...\n\nOr kinda bad, too: You get the progress of the one with a clear and the other can just walk past all the puzzles...\n\nThat's what I think.

And when you fall into the abyss, instead of putting you back where you jumped from, it put you back by a portal. Which disoriented me a lot. Add the fact there's no map...  \nClimbing was inconsistent. I'd go over the same ledge multiple times and suddenly, nope. Not this time.   \nI was having a heckuva time finding all the evidence for the sisters and all Zeki's loot, even with a walkthrough because the only distinct island was the one with the orb in front.   \n\n\nI've gamed on PC and game systems, and I can only think of a few boss battles that had me so ticked off and frustrated.  \n\n\nI'd love to have the cloudminnow to display, but thinking of trying to figure out what 4 eggs I missed are...yeah, not anytime soon.\n\n### Comment ID kd75uur with +2 score by [(peppermintblue, Reddit, 2023-12-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kd75uur/) (in reply to ID kczffgz):\nThank you for speaking up about your experience in this particular temple as an able-bodied person.  I'm sorry that you're so frustrated by the area!   The fact that so many non-disabled people are pipping up with the same concerns that are also causing issues for disabled people is validating.  A lot of the time we only get listened to is when non-disabled people pipe up and point out that something really is a problem. \n\nI hope they make modifications to the temple soon so that all of us have a real shot at finishing the area.\n\n## Comment ID kd0mg1g with +2 score by [(Divinora, Reddit, 2023-12-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kd0mg1g/) (in reply to ID 18ewr01):\nI don't have any disabilities that I know of except bad eye sight.

I think the only reason people don't think of bad eyesight (but not blind) as not being a disability is because it's so normalized and is easy to fix with the technology we have. \n\nI'm sorry that you're having so much trouble with the temple.

I've even seen the game as a whole be outright called a platform game more than once in the comments, which is not how it's advertised.\n\nI'm glad you had an easy time with the temple.  I wish they offered an alternative when it comes to main storyline content.  One of the solutions talked about in this thread was that Zeki says something about giving you a Zeki coin on your own... so you go try, but if you fail a number of times you can go back and cop to not being able to do it... then he has to look into a new solution and locks you out of the temple for a number of Palian days... after that, he has you do a quest or something to pick up a device for your glider that will make it so that you can just fly across.     And with that suggestion, can I ask, how would it make someone going across on their own matter less?  They still got more than I would using the alternative questline.  \n\n\nAnd yes, I do agree that it all boils down to capitalism.   Unfortunately, since I became disabled, I have very much learned how capitalism is decidedly un-cozy.\n\n## Comment ID kcrp4vw with +2 score by [(browncoatsunited, Reddit, 2023-12-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kcrp4vw/) (in reply to ID 18ewr01):\nMy problem is that the directions are unclear and I accidentally fell off the main island as was transferred to the end island before finishing the main quest so I am now bugged and unable to complete the quest until s6 fixes it.\n\n### Comment ID kcur9q3 with +1 score by [(peppermintblue, Reddit, 2023-12-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kcur9q3/) (in reply to ID kcrp4vw):\nIf you haven't make sure you submit feedback via [support.palia.com](https://support.palia.com) for the bug, if you haven't thought to do that yet.

It was easier for them to just make a whole new client than it was to fix MTGO.

Now that I'm coming back, literally all my decks are worthless due to rotation, and historic decks are too expensive to build even on a budget, unless I want to bring a pauper deck to historic. \n\nMeanwhile, last few days I've been playing the New to MTGO modern Gauntlet, and I've been having a blast.

They have regular updates, and the updates aren't particularly bad, but it's not innovating or re-defining the primary gameplay loop, but building more of the same. If they could only rip out the core character choices, build out some better play areas, better ability interactions (the lag is tangible and prevalent), and not just standard party/raid instances, it might have had a shot. The aesthetic is also unique, but odd.

But that's in the context that MtGO's health, in many ways, was already poor.\n\nAs I said in my above comment (and I largely feel this way after reading all comments here), the smart money is that WotC is just dumping the maintenance and upkeep of the program onto a third party so they can stop shoveling good money after bad into the thing. There's a vanishingly small chance that WotC is doing this to overhaul MtGO, something they couldn't realistically do in-house since that would effectively mean building a new program completely from scratch. But as others in the thread have pointed out, this is not Daybreak's MO. \n\nBased on Daybreak's reputation and history and the rather sparse press release, and absent any new developments or information, I'm guessing this secures MtGO's survival for at least a few years longer than it would have without going to a third party, but just treading water, keeping the status quo.\n\nTime will tell.\n\n#### Comment ID hppo941 with +45 score by [(Isawa_Chuckles, Reddit, 2021-12-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/rmym78/daybreak_games_to_develop_and_publish_mtgo/hppo941/) (in reply to ID hppjqr9):\nIf Daybreak's good for anything, it's dragging out a game's death as long as possible.\n\n#### Comment ID hpqo5pj with +2 score by [(Kerrus, Reddit, 2021-12-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/rmym78/daybreak_games_to_develop_and_publish_mtgo/hpqo5pj/) (in reply to ID hppjqr9):\nI legitimately laughed when the announcement mentioned wotc's mtgo dev team.

Daybreak will definitely keep it going as they have kept DCUO going, but to say the least the team tanked it after SOE got bought out by the venture capital company that formed Daybreak.\n\nMtGO will continue to exist, but it will be with crutches and issues.

With arena existing I don't think WotC would ever give MtGO the love it needs, but there's definitely a chance DBG could. Daybreak has gone through a lot of re-management in the last couple of years, I can't speak for any of their other games, but Planetside 2 has gone from a life support team of 3 people 2 years ago, back to a full dev team pushing out massive amounts of updates.

They probably will eventually mercy kill MODO, but going to Daybreak means they are intending to milk it for another half decade or more.\n\nThe good/bad side of things is that per current timetables, it is very possible that we see them move pioneer and modern to Arena during this duration. I doubt vintage or legacy will make it intact, though I would not be surprised to see neutered versions eventually.\n\nAssuming they backlog two blocks a year a la the remastered sets, by 2027, Arena has all of pioneer, and Modern all the way back to Future Sight or so (and would likely have all of Modern by 2030). I mean, say what you will about Arena's predatory pricing models and all that. But Wizards wants people playing lots of Magic and burning lots of cash to do so. It is in the company's best interest to unify players under one system, and have said system be one without card redemption and no trade economy, so every single player has to buy each card they need (twice, if they play paper too).\n\nIt is not ideal for the player base, but they don't want to throw us or their formats to the wolves. They just want everybody paying (what they see as) their fair share. This isn't going to be apocalyptic, it is just going to be inconvenient.\n\n### Comment ID hpu6qs1 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-12-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/rmym78/daybreak_games_to_develop_and_publish_mtgo/hpu6qs1/) (in reply to ID hpt4meu):\nRight.

Rest assured nothing will change there. Claws of Veeshan launches on December 8 and Reign of Shadows a week later on December 15. We are excited to bring you these new entries in Norrath’s stories.\n\n>As a studio, you may have already noticed we have been doing some hiring recently in support of reinvestment projects. While we aren’t quite ready to discuss the details of those yet, they are in support of the live operations of EverQuest and EverQuest II. \n\n>Specifically, being acquired by EG7 advances our ability to continue our development in EverQuest and EverQuest 2, and further spur on our ongoing dedication to EverQuest as a brand.\n\n>I am particularly excited because of what Darkpaw brings to EG7, with over 21 years of knowledge and innovation in the live service games space we offer a unique perspective for the many other companies in the EG7 family. I look forward to sharing that expertise on a much larger scale that is afforded to us by this acquisition. \n\n>From me, and all of the team at Darkpaw Games, we hope your holiday season is filled with joy and wish you a happy new year. \n\n>Jenn Chan\n\n## Comment ID geb5d53 with +5 score by [(AugustusXII, Reddit, 2020-12-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/k4pzcm/daybreak_game_company_to_be_acquired_by_eg7_for/geb5d53/) (in reply to ID k4pzcm):\nI kinda hope this acquisition brings back Just Survive, but I doubt it lol.\n\n### Comment ID gebz2xu with +2 score by [(Starbound_Selly, Reddit, 2020-12-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/k4pzcm/daybreak_game_company_to_be_acquired_by_eg7_for/gebz2xu/) (in reply to ID geb5d53):\nAgreed, I miss the survival aspect of the game, they stretched themselves thin, then tossed the original game aside when the royale started rolling in.

Sure the graphics and UI is absolutely ancient but as a game—a set of rules and rewards—it’s better today than a lot of other stuff on the market\n\n#### Comment ID geeyosk with +1 score by [(Excuse_my_GRAMMER, Reddit, 2020-12-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/k4pzcm/daybreak_game_company_to_be_acquired_by_eg7_for/geeyosk/) (in reply to ID geexyu5):\nNo doubt I’m not saying it not an awesome game at all but you can’t compare the Everquest IP to Warcraft, Star Wars or final fantasy IP, While many player enjoy eq1 as it is now without a doubt they would have invested into face lifting The UI and graphics it would have been more successful \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a company purchase another company it for the IP right , daybreak didn’t progress the Everquest IP, just milk it and I doubt that this company has any plans to progress it ether no EQ3 anytime soon\n\n### Comment ID gee4919 with +2 score by [(Salemandero, Reddit, 2020-12-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/k4pzcm/daybreak_game_company_to_be_acquired_by_eg7_for/gee4919/) (in reply to ID gec8w7p):\nIf they could figure out how to give any of the EQ games VR support, I'd be playing them exclusively.\n\n#### Comment ID geez6ch with +2 score by [(Excuse_my_GRAMMER, Reddit, 2020-12-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/k4pzcm/daybreak_game_company_to_be_acquired_by_eg7_for/geez6ch/) (in reply to ID gee4919):\nEq1 experience in VR with updates graphic would be a killer mmorpg\n\n## Comment ID gebd0z6 with +1 score by [(luciferisgreat, Reddit, 2020-12-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/k4pzcm/daybreak_game_company_to_be_acquired_by_eg7_for/gebd0z6/) (in reply to ID k4pzcm):\nEG7 is a mega corporation.\nThere will be no changes.\n\n## Comment ID geclvzu with +1 score by [(WabbaWay, Reddit, 2020-12-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/k4pzcm/daybreak_game_company_to_be_acquired_by_eg7_for/geclvzu/) (in reply to ID k4pzcm):\nGuess I hate something called EG7 now.

If it had been done right, with Landmark paving the way for user creations to be put IN a mmorpg... Well, it could have been a whole new path for the genre. A true \"world\" and not one that fell down the low-fruit grab of raiding gear grinds and waiting on developers to bring all the content.  Current MMOs feel like they're trapped in Amber. Forever static with no way to actually affect the world in meaningful ways.\n\nFollowing EQnext news when it was in development gave me a sense of excitement again. Something I had not felt in years, with the stagnant genre and all the WoW clones it produced. It was a spark of hope that was too good to be true, and I still feel the burn of that letdown. We went down the darkest timeline instead.\n\nWatch this trailer to remind yourself for a moment, what could have been:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeEga7fsAHg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeEga7fsAHg)"

          "review": "Initially I adored this game, it's easy to get in to, the story itself is fun, and there are so many adorable things to collect . The community was super friendly, and the core game-play has a little something for everyone (cooking, mining, fishing, npc friendships, ect).\n\nHowever, at some point the people developing the game lost their passion for the project, sold it off, and now it has become nothing but a [i] lifeless money grab. [/i] The regular updates have continued, but every single update for the last year has been \"Look at all these wonderful shiny things you can buy!\" Bugs continue to go unfixed, to the point that entire areas of the map have become no-touch zones unless you want to randomly venture outside the realm of existence. The few free updates that have been released where centered around things that had already been in the game before, such as time-limited events being stripped bare and turned into monthly occurrences.\n\nI gladly spent money on this game once upon a time to support it's development, but as the game continues to stagnate I can't help but wonder where, exactly, that money is going. $25 for a singular outfit is astronomical on it's own, but when you have thousands of players throwing $20-$50 into the game each month, and all you can bother to do is push out more cosmetics/decor, it becomes nothing more than insulting. \n\nIf you're looking for something to occupy you for a weekend or a few days until you can buy a better game, this isn't a bad choice. It's still wonderful and fun to play with your friends. Just don't expect a story-line, as the mainline story is short, empty, and has gone untouched since it's release. Don't expect this to be a game you hang on to and enjoy for months or even years. Most of all, don't throw your money at it in support believing that they'll be able to use it to improve the core game, they abandoned that long ago.",

          "review": "I'm going to complain, not because I hate the game but because I actually really like it. Making 'My Time at Portia' or 'Stardew Valley' into an MMORPG is a great idea and it's mostly well executed. However...\n\nThe game is needlessly grindy. It takes hundreds or even thousands of hours to do everything it has to offer. It's understandable because this is an MMO and they need to retain players, but I sometimes feel like my time as a player is not being respected. If you need a rare fish you might need hundreds or thousands of fishing attempts before you get it. If you want a plushie you'll be hunting for hours or days or weeks. Everything has a time mechanic, whether it be processing wood, ore, cloth, or farming. You want your crops to grow one stage? Better wait an hour. You want to process this ore? That's 10 minutes per bar. It's all gated behind a wait period. There is plenty to do while you wait, but it feels like an needless limitation to keep you hooked.\n\nSpeaking of needless, it seems like the game is needlessly designed in a way to create regret. You can easily spend your renown upgrading your plot instead of your focus. There's mistakes you can make doing quests that result in a \"bad\" outcome and one-time quest rewards that once consumed are gone forever, but actually can be used for decoration. The process of choosing a name is confusing and once chosen you're stuck with it forever. There's even a precious broken sign in front of your plot that once cut down can never come back, and people keep it as some kind of badge of honor. I'm not sure why the game is designed this way, there's not even a way to delete your character and make a new one without creating a new account. New players who don't have a friend to guide them or do a lot of research on the game will make these mistakes and regret them.\n\nThen there's the in-game cash shop. I think it's mostly okay, in that the items are cosmetic and you don't really need to buy anything to play. However the prices are often a little high and when it comes to buying an outfit that looks good, a plot environment, a pet, and some tool skins you're looking at spending between $50-100 USD. It's possible to wait for sales and use the loyalty program to get a few things cheaper but as this is a social game and you want to look good in front of other people so a lot of players just end up shelling out way too much money.\n\nAlso the technical issues are annoying, we have deer floating in the air, randomly falling while climbing, getting locked talking to NPCs, chat not working, unable to leave quest-specific areas, etc... I've heard the game developer has had a lot of layoffs, and that the game is mostly abandoned and only has a skeleton crew, that's really disappointing. I want this game to ripen not die on the vine.\n\nAs a last mention, I wanted to talk about the \"exploits\". While most of these are fine (animation canceling is sort of a cool skill you can learn), the limitations to building your plot just seem completely unnecessary. Why not let people clip items or build outside their plot? It's not hurting anything and creates unique design opportunities and creativity. \n\nOverall Palia is really fun, it's just plagued with a few problems. I hope this review helps to catalyze the issues of other players and encourages the developers to do the work this game deserves.\n\nIf any new players are still interested in the game even after my complaints, use code f2942929-4f13-4147-ba10-613e55e19b62 when signing up for fruit bowl or something. My moral standing is lying down.\n\nNote: I also wanted to point out that Steam Deck owners can play this game! It runs at 60 FPS and all online capabilities are functional right now. I used Proton Experimental but it might also work on the stable Proton.",

          "review": "Palia launched in December 2023 with it's own launcher.\nThe studio behind Palia was acquired by Daybreak in 2024.\nNearly 40% of the staff were laid off. \n\nThe majority of all updates (patches excluded) since they launched now were about getting you to spend your money in their shop, seriously they add new cosmetics for you to buy multiple times a month. The rest of the updates is about new ways to gather decoration and also bug fixes (The game is still extremly buggy it is also poorely optimized.)\n\nThere are OVER 120 premium outfits for you to buy. This does not include the diffrent colored versions that you can buy seperately. Almost every single outfit will cost you more than 15 Euro. The \"fanciest\" will cost over 30.\nThere are premium skins for your tools you can buy. (around 20 skins? some of them are weird because it's only for half of your tools?)\nThere are over 40 pets you can buy.\nThere are 8 landscapes for your house you can buy.\nThere are around 20 skins for your glider that you can buy.\nYou can buy emotes and reaction stickers.\nOne of their last \"big\" updates was a paid premium \"club\" where you need to log in every day in order to receive the highest possible amount of premium currency.\n\nALL of these things were added since they launched in 2023 but there still was no real story or lore update. They added ONE character who does not get to leave her room and does not walk around outside.\nThey are already recycling their ingame events. IF you want to call a timed window to buy or craft seasonal items an event.\nI like the blackmarket they added but it's really just a place for you to grind a minigame if you want giant plushies (your chance for a plushie bag is 1,5%).\n\nConsidering they are now extremly understaffed I highly doubt this game will ever leave it's Beta state.",

However, the thumbs down at this moment is hopefully to help folks get a slightly bigger picture of what I realized in 14 hours of game play.\r\n\r\nThis game dont get me wrong is good. The bones are here, and the storyline is definately got me excited!\r\n\r\nHowever, I have come to learn that I have finished the story line as it has been written within ~5-8 hours. Im at a *wait for the story to continue*. I was like cool, ive caught up, when should I expect the story line to continue. Sadly, a quick Google search tells me that  been a work in progress for almost a year now, with little insight on when it will progress.\r\n\r\nSo this a friendly warning, This game is GOOD. However, dont join it yet. If you are like me and get sucked up into the storylines of games, the unfinished status, and little improvements are sure to drive you insane. I want to know what happens, I want to know why I exist! While I understand improving relationships with the Palian people are a must to a degree... the idea there is nothing to really shoot for at the moment is not a very big enticement. \r\n\r\nI hope they will improve the game soon with more storyline quests, and not turn out to be a game like Star Stable that has had 10+ years to finish a storyline, and still can't/wont.\r\n",

Shitty powerpoint skins from the 2000s for £5-10, that crash the game and their response? \"Dont use them\". The release of \"content\" is so that the rightfully pissed off players have something to pacify them for another month.

          "review": "I've been playing this game for a few days and I've put almost 30 hours into it, so as per usual, it's time for a review.\n\n!! SPOILERS AHEAD !!\n\n**Things I like about Palia**\n- There isn't really a time limit. Because it runs on IRL time for a lot of things, there are no seasons or specific slots of time where you could potentially miss something because you forgot to look at the clock. Stores are always open and NPCs are always available.\n- The npcs have a lot of life to them. They have relationships with other characters outside of what the player experiences. They have pasts, they have presents, and they have aspirations for the future.\n- The storyline is pretty good, if you're paying attention. You do have to put in the effort to read the hidden tablets and the engravings and whatnot to piece things together - you can also get dialogue from characters that elude to things that have happened. This game does NOT spoon feed you the lore - or anything, really.\n- I personally appreciate the variety of romanceable characters. You have a couple that are older, you have a couple that are younger, you have varying ethnicities and you have a non-organic companion ( I hesitate to call him a robot, he is fully sentient and conscious ).\n- The graphics are really pretty! It's stylized in a way that's charming without being cartoonish. \n- Choosing a body type in the character creation screen DOES NOT equate to gendered pronouns. I know this is nitpicky but I'm always frustrated when I have to pick between an accurate depiction of me, and being comfortable with what the npcs are calling me (I tend to create my character in my likeness, instead of creating a new character like some folks do - no shame either way!).\n\n**Things I do NOT like about Palia**\n- It. Takes. So. Long. To. Do. *Anything.* The game runs off of an irl 24 hour clock (as most mmos do). While in-game days are shorter (I think about 20 minutes or so), mechanics like smithing, wood cutting, smelting, etc. can take upwards of half an hour depending on what tools you have and what you're trying to make. You can only give npcs gifts once per IRL DAY. Romantic gifts are only allowed once per irl *WEEK*. Everything takes a LONG time. You really need to have both time on your hands and a lot of patience to get anywhere.\n- The game is still technically in beta, despite being released, so I'm a little more forgiving about this, but there are a lot of grammar and spelling errors. Sometimes npcs repeat dialogue in a single interaction, sometimes they glitch through the floor, sometimes they just up and disappear for a few minutes and pop up on the other side of the map. There are a lot of minor, quality of life glitches like this throughout the game - however I have yet to find any glaring issues with gameplay and mechanics that would keep you from enjoying the game.\n- Most of the cosmetics are locked behind a paywall - not a huge deal to me, because I don't really care for most extravagant outfits and fxs and whatnot, but if you're looking to really personalize your character, be prepared to spend some money. It's not *cheap* either, you could spend 20 bucks on a single outfit.\n- Very few of the mechanics are explained. While most of them are simple (chop tree, cut wood, make chair) others are less intuitive (interact with npcs, get renown, find local shrine, commune with shrine, spend renown to gain xp bonuses \"focus\", eat food to keep focus, use focus to gain more xp to create more things to interact with more npcs, rinse, repeat). None of these are really explained, you have to hover over icons and text boxes to get more information, or stumble upon something and remember it for later. It's fine if you're used to the fetch-quest type games, but if you're new to this it can be frustrating.\n\n**The low-down**\nI, personally, would not recommend this game unless you are *really* into grinding. If you want to get anywhere in the game you're going to have to lose hours of your day just to get through a single lore quest. There isn't a whole lot to keep you occupied in the meantime.\nIf you're into that, go for it! If you'd rather shave your teeth on a chalkboard than spend an hour smelting stone bricks, maybe play Fields of Mistria instead.",

          "review": "Well, the good news is that Palia is a free-to-play game so I didn't have to spend any money on it to discover that it wasn’t for me. This game feels somewhat incomplete and like an uglier and slightly different version of World of Warcraft. I didn’t realize how much I wasn’t into the idea of another MMORPG until I tried this game out. I was slogging through the character conversations and dreading seeing yet another quest marker pop up and gathering materials.\n\nThere are long loading screens in this game even on a high-end PC, and they sometimes have wait lists with other players ahead of you, clearly a server limitation. I don't like having to sit there in silence waiting for things to load to get into another zone.\n\nThe UI is hit and miss. The grid-like placement, rotation, stacking and movement options for housing and furniture are great and intuitive. I wish other games had the same decoration and organization system as Palia.\n\nThe character creator was clunky. It’s missing a zoom-in (scroll in/scroll out) option, and I’d have to flip through tabs to get it to zoom in on my character’s face again. Somehow I pressed a button that undid my clothing choices multiple times and I was on edge with my clicks so that I wouldn’t mess things up again. Similar to Hogwarts Legacy, my character looked way prettier and sounded way better in the character creator. I look at her sometimes running around and I think that she is now ugly and her voice turned out very annoying. I don't know how these character creators are not translating accurately to the game itself.\n\nWhen I came into this game as a new player, there were multiple times where quest markers on the map were unclear and NPCs were not located where they were supposed to be according to the quest notes. This led to a lot of frustration and running around and then giving up. Later, I saw there was some sort of a bug that kept NPCs from being where they should have been that was being patched. Not a great first impression. Sometimes quests are not marked on the map and sometimes they are, and I am not sure why.\n\nThere are no mounts in this game, but I kind of feel like there should be because there are large areas to run around. They would also make things look more interesting.\n\nThe premium cash shop has some pretty cosmetics and some really rough looking ones with ugly colors and ragged edges to the designs.\n\nThings feel kind of empty in the starting zone. It's a bunch of brand new players mixed in with players covered in premium cash shop gear and pets. I don't really feel like it's a particularly beautiful land to be in.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't find any of the NPCs that are romanceable to be appealing. They're all just purple people and one robot.\n\nThe thing that really soured me toward this game is that your dialogue choices impact what personality element is chosen for you later on, and at one point I misclicked a dialogue choice and wasn't able to see what I selected and there was no way to go back or to press undo, or to review what I had answered historically, etc. This mysteriously answered and missed conversation that I had with an NPC would not stop haunting me, and apparently if you ask support for your character to be reset, it causes you to lose all your referral rewards and purchased real world cosmetics on your character! So I was stuck with this feeling of messing up, tainting the game for me.\n\nThe fishing system is really impressive. It's well done and enjoyable, unlike some other games which make it really tedious. Bug catching was also cute and fun, with the idea of smoke bombing a bug to stun it and pick it up.\n\nI enjoyed the soil tilling and plant watering mechanics. Walking around your soil patch with your tool and seeing it visibly make changes is very neat.\n\nI didn't enjoy hunting with a bow and arrow. You chase a small sprinting target animal around trying to hit it multiple times while your arrows are wasted.\n\nAs someone who played World of Warcraft for years and then quit because it started feeling like a second job, I am not finding this MMO to be pleasurable enough to continue it. It's not as high quality and attractive as World of Warcraft, and I quit that game.",

          "review": "Palia is a really enjoyable life sim, cozy building game with some relatively okay social aspects, but since launch has continuously grown to become a money sink for cosmetics, and unfortunately hasn't done much in the way of improving gameplay since launch.\n\nEvery update since open beta launch has undoubtedly contained more updates to premium offerings than there has to the base game offerings. Pets, housing landscapes, skin tools, etc, are all locked behind money purchases, with none available (that I am aware of) in game. Granted I haven't played since middle of last year, but every time I come back to reach a patch, it seems like there's maybe one QOL update, and 5 premium shop additions, with the usual bug fixing. \n\nIt's a free game, they have to make money, but at some point the game gets so stale and repetitive that you just zone out. Hell, there hasn't been any additional big open zones since the closed beta! There's many ways to improve upon the gameplay flow to make things more engaging and more exciting, but Palia has gone the route of premium purchases to keep the services afloat. Until they start balancing out giving some simpler rewards to regular players and letting premium players flare up with their shiny outfit, i'm probably going to leave this game on my backburner. \n\ntl;dr It's a free game and has some okay gameplay for 5 hours or so, then gets reptitive. The premium store is pretty aggressive on offerings and prices, and the development team seems to put more effort into updating the store offerings than the actual game.",

A family member and I who play this game thought that a one time payment to make your own sets of clothes and sell them to other people rather than than the design team. I feel like they should stick to more of an oriental magical feel rather than Victorian. If they do Victorian, Magic Steampunk designs would work better.",

          "review": "Oh boy, where to begin. First of all, I love parts of the game, but the further you get in the story, the more buggy it is. I've had to restart quests I've already done, received duplicate awards for something I did a long time ago, and don't get me started on the controls (I use a controller on PC). \r\n\r\nSo, first thing I'll say is that at some point in the quests, the game becomes just straight grinding for a while. There's not much happening story-wise, and the things you have to gather for quests are sometimes ridiculous for rewards that are meh. My first weeks and days of playing, I WAS HOOKED. This game was my new hyperfixation, I thought about it at school, work and even in my dreams. It was fun, rewarding because there was constantly something new, and it was fun to just build my house and upgrade my things. But after a while, I would log on, and not have anything to do. I'd go chop some wood, mine some rocks or whatever, every single time. I think that if you play with friends, that's okay, you can still have fun with them. I LOVED exploring the new temples, finding every secret and chests. Oh, the chest. Why? Why can't you sell them? You have so many at the end, and they are too ugle to display, especially if you have 15 of the same sort. Sure, you can give them to Tish, but you have so many that it's stupid and you can't keep up with the one day gift rule. \r\n\r\nThe game is fine, the world is charming, and the characters are mostly (looking at you Kenli) loveable. But mannn is it wasted when the game is so unpolished like it is. Bugs that force me to quit and restart the game, 12 year olds fighting over something stupid in chat, and it's clear that the devs are focusing more on the money side of things by releasing new skins and outfits. Sure, it's nice, and as a cosmetic fan usually i'm on board, but the game gets boring because there aren't that many events and story updates. \r\n\r\nAlso, the control mapping IS HELLA STUPID! Why would you ever think that mapping the B button for the jump is alright? And the building system suuuuuuckkkssss. It counts your player collision as you move things in the overhead house menu, you have to place things individually for paths, and it's impossible to put stuff up on shelves or on top of dressers. Also, very sad that the pets are not really used. It's just for cosmetics. Would love to just pet my companion or something.\r\n\r\nIt seems like the game encourages exploration, but sometimes you do a hard parkour (eg the lighthouse) only to be rewarded with nothing. Nothing at all. You get blocked by invisible walls on a ledge that looks climbable and the vines are HELLA bugged and make you fall most of the time. Also, it's very difficult to notice what is gatherable or interactible. The big trees fool me all the time, because they look EXACTLY like the regular ones (eg the large heartwood trees), sometimes the decorative plants are more vibrant than the actual gatherable ones, and the stone and iron ores are not that different visually wise, especially in certain lighting.\r\n\r\nI did not understand the community? What does it actually do? I haven't ever used it in the how many hours I've played this game. I thought Palia had a way for your friends and you to share a village and build it together, but it looks like that's not the case.\r\n\r\nOverall: Did I enjoy this game? Yes. But as a game dev myself, it's clear this game needs A LOT more polishing, and the build mode is VERY rough. But as this game is still in Beta, I have to give them some slack. But as the game is still in this stage almost 2 years later, it is a bit worrying.\r\n\r\n If you are a casual gamer and only want a cute game with stardew valley esque mecanics and characters, go for it! If you are someone who wants to have a great time with friends, this game is for you! But just know that Palia is not perfect and has a bunch of flaws. If you are planning to beat the game, this is not for you.",

Never thought I would be interested in any of these \"cozy\" games, but here I am, having a great time.  I always played mostly shooters, action adventure, or rpgs here and there.  I was exposed to Stardew for the first time a handful of months ago, and was surprised how much I enjoyed the laid back gameplay, while still enjoying a deep story and plenty of stuff to do.  A buddy of mine mentioned Palia and told me he got hooked on it, so I figured I would give it a shot.  I currently have around 25 hours into it after less than 2 weeks.  It's really nice having a game I can jump into after work to garden, gather materials, knock out a few quests, etc.  There's no pressure, no time limit, no health bar, no competition, no getting mad because some 12 year old sniped me from across the map.  It's just relaxing.  I also like that whether I jump on for 20 minutes or play for hours, I'm still progressing and doing something.  It really is a game you can play at your own pace without any pressure.  Currently, I'm in a party with my buddy that told me about it, my 36 year old brother, and my girlfriend.  All of us have been having a blast managing our plots and doing quests.  When more than one of us is online at the same time, it's fun to jump on discord to chat, gather materials, and help each other upgrade our skills.  I never would have thought that I would enjoy a game like this, but it really is a great way to relax after work, and meet with friends without any competition or stress involved.",

          "review": "If you're looking for an action-packed thrill ride, this ain't the game for you. If you're looking for a no-danger cozy building sim, then you'll be right at home here. The game is completely free to play and although it does have cosmetic microtransactions, it never nags you to buy anything. Ever. The only thing even remotely close to that is a short \"quest\" to just look at the premium shop. So, with that stuff out of the way, let's talk about the ups and downs of this game.\n\nFirst, the positives. Well, it's a UE game, so expect the visuals to be top-notch... and they are. This game is absolutely beautiful. The scenery is very lovely, the characters are well-made and well-animated. There are numerous concurrent storylines to invest in, and every character falls into a particular archetype or two. Naturally, there are romance options, and the game doesn't care if it's het or not. Tish and Jel in particular have wonderful romance paths. Tish in particular is involved with what is probably the most expansive skill in the game, which is Furniture Making. There's a dizzying array of stuff to craft to build your home, and the skill itself is little more than \"collect stuff, make-stuff-animation\". There's no complex steps to this skill, unlike Cooking... which I will get to later in this review. So once you have the materials, you can just build it in a few seconds on your workbench, then place it in your home. Object placement is very flexible, though it can be a bit glitchy at times. There are other skills to work on, such as Fishing, Bug-Catching, Hunting, and my personal favorite, Foraging. This involves both collecting plants and chopping trees. It's surprisingly relaxing. Farming is another skill worth investing in, and is probably the easiest to level quickly once you have enough soil plots. It's probably also the best way to make money. Once you're making a lot of star-quality produce, your finances will quickly become a non-issue. Another major positive of this game is the item request system. You can request of others to send you a particular item, and others can opt to fulfill the request. This is part of one quest in particular, and doing this a lot earns you Renown, which should be obvious as to what it is. Use Renown to boost your Focus bar, which increases the amount of experience you earn for each skill. Nom food to keep your Focus bar filled. Very solid mechanics there. Oh, and there's a kitty. Zeki is awesome. I swear he didn't force me to say that... but anyway, the last positive bit I will mention here, and it's a major one, is the sound design. The. Sound. Is. Incredible. This may even be a larger shining star than the visuals. The music is absolutely beautiful and is affected by location and time, with some tracks changing instrument sets in real time depending on where you are, such as in the town in Kilima. There's a base track that plays, and it will vary depending on which building you're in. That's such a great technique that not a lot of games utilize. BOTW did this in Hyrule Castle, and I thought it was perfect. Anyway, sound effects are also super important. The game does foley sounds correctly, and you can hone your hunting and bug-catching skills by remembering the various sounds of the critters you're after and keeping an ear out for them (or two ears, really). At no point does the music become intrusive; it's designed to be background music to enhance the cozy feel of the game. Just absolutely brilliant sound design all-around.\n\nOK so... the negatives. Oh man, where do I even start. This game is plagued with problems. I cannot even get into the issues without acknowledging the Sugarfoot in the room, which is the completely broken coldet. This issue is so legendary that I think they keep it broken on purpose as to not disrupt people's expectations. Climbing cliffs in particular is so broken that I'm wondering how this even passed QA. Sure, blame it on the beta status, but it's been like this since the beginning with no sign of ever being addressed. Sometimes, parts of the scenery don't load properly, or colliders don't load properly, leading to all kinds of hilarious nonsense. I once found that I could walk completely through hills and even go totally underwater with no consequences. Sometimes you get trees that you can completely walk through, and although this hasn't happened since I started playing this version, sometimes chopping down trees with Muujin in them will launch you into the sky. That was the most hilarious nonsense ever. I've taken video of it when playing on the Switch version. These collective coldet issues can be a major problem on certain main story quests, where being able to navigate the environment swiftly and accurately are key to success. But anyway, other issues are minor, but some are more important than others. There's a MASSIVE amount of typos in the game. Misspelled words, incorrect punctuation, doubled words, you name it. It seems no one is on staff to proofread or even test. I found one bit in particular where the response option was the text that the character was supposed to say next, preceded by a scripting control code. What a hilarious screwup. Other issues include things such as the game forgetting your run configuration, so you run when you're not holding down the run button, and numerous little glitches when you're editing your home. I once ran into a glitch where I was trying to move something inside of the tent and the entire tent started moving on its own. Plot editing in general is loaded with little glitches like that. There's been times where I try to edit a room's windows and press Up to scroll the view and the edit option goes away and the Esc key does nothing. Seriously broken stuff. However, most of this pales in comparison to the biggest problem the game has so far, which is the fact that the developers rarely take player feedback, or even bug reports, seriously. Oh, and the cosmetics are WAY too expensive. Their business model is completely stupid. People would be more inclined to purchase cosmetics if they brought the prices down considerably. As it stands, expect to pay $20-$30 for most cosmetic items. That's way past the threshold most people are willing to pay. Bring it down to under $10 a pop and way more money would be going into the game, which would allow for more money to pay staff, which would lead to a better game. My only other gripe with this game, and it's kind of minor compared to the other major issues but is still important to me and many others, is the total lack of aesthetics when it comes to your player character. This follows the current-day trend of character amorphism. If you play as a female character, don't expect to see any kind of feminine beauty. Your character will be washboard-flat and you cannot change this. If you play as a male character, don't expect to be physically masculine at all. You're a feminine stick insect and you cannot change this. All of the base outfits lack any kind of cuteness or appeal, and even most of the premium outfits are similarly sterile. This is, as they call it, an \"appeal to the modern audience\", which everyone knows does not actually exist. The only time I see other players even wearing premium cosmetics are when they're among the very few items that actually add some feminine charm to their character. Cuteness and sex appeal sells, people...\n\nOh... and Cooking is a terrible skill. Worse than Fishing. Overcomplicated minigame that only exists to allow for party-type skilling. The interface is awful and unintuitive and the steps don't usually make any sense.\n\nSo all in all, yeah... it's got massive amounts of issues, but it's also got massive amounts of charm. This game has a ridiculous amount of potential, but is being kneecapped by amateur buffoonery and current-day social apologetics. It's absolutely worth playing though, and is easy to get addicted to.",

          "review": "Palia is a decent game, maybe, if you stay completely free to play. I would not recommend purchasing anything from the cash shop because it was not that long ago when we couldn't equip many of the cash shop items we had already purchased. This was not cause for alarm on their end. It took them several weeks to fix the issue, and there was never any compensation for the delay for those who had already purchased the items that we could no longer equip.\r\n\r\nWith each new update, they manage to make this game less and less functional. The game has been plagued with game breaking glitches, including but not limited to: broken tool swapping, broken zone swapping, broken group functions, not being able to use your purchased cosmetics for weeks at a time, can't move items on your plot, can't find items that were on your plot but have now vanished into the ground, players falling through the ground on a loop and getting stuck under buildings/terrain that have vanished, etc. Instead of focusing on improving game play by fixing these issues, they just keep adding new features. We can't swap tools to collect resources during actual game play, but now we can emote at each other with colorful stickers! (insert angry Hassian sticker here)\r\n\r\nThey never fail, however, to add new items for purchase in the cash shop. Every single update, without fail, includes more digital stuff to buy. Even during the period of time where none of us could use our tool cosmetics because they were causing people to crash, they still managed to release additional cosmetics... including new tool skins!!!\r\n\r\nThe story is pretty good, the paid cosmetics are super cute, and there is an abundance of cute free to play outfits as well. The cozy piece of this \"cozy game\" fails because of the frustration from the glitches and they have completely lost my trust as far as the cash shop goes. It's not unreasonable to expect to be able to use the things you've paid for, unless you are a character in Palia. I would love to see them fix the issues with this game because it really was great while it lasted but as I said, buyer beware on the cash shop.",

A typical farm-management game but it's a free-to-play game, so expect some cash-grab content. Now, don't get me wrong, I love farm-management games. But I got more from Stardew Valley, Sun Haven, and Slime Rancher. There's a few more out there, but I find them much more ful-filling. I can't say that's not fair against Palia. It has potential, truly but it's really not for me. I feel there's too much running around for quests and not really focusing on much else.",

The fact that you can play for free blows my mind!\n\nI love that though you get to the end of one part of your story, you can keep going and going. There is so much to explore and build and being able to play solo or team up with others is fantastic. Majority of players are ready to explain things to help a newbie out \n\nGraphically beautiful and exciting to see new outfits/pets and so forth coming in fairly frequently. I should note that these do generally require some form of payment (especially the pets), but there is a variety of clothing options for free and given the quality of game we are receiving I feel is more than fair for a little individualisation if you want it.",

It has the play style I loved in ACNH, with more complex graphics and functionality (reminds me a little of dreamlight, touch of breath of the wild vibes). Beautiful graphics, great story, lovable characters. \n\nI really only have 2 things that make it less enjoyable for me to play:\n-hit boxes need work. Some quests, but definitely gardening, can be very tedious. For example, finding the hit box on the flow gates was so hard I thought the quest glitched. \n-weapon switch for hunting. Love the idea of chopping a tree and finding animals, but the mechanics of switching from ax to bow is rough. Maybe its better on switch, but for PC it could use a key assignment.",

This one is a calm sea. The players are so helpful.  The quests are easy to challenging.  I'm getting better, restful sleep at night after logging off the game.   The story lines are whimsical to melancholy.  It draws out some creativity you didn't know you had as you build up your home plots.  Have fun.  Cheers!",

          "review": "The harvest game I've been craving, that doesn't have punishing MMO elements, instead sharing loot of those participating in things like hunting as well as buffs for anyone participating in the same activity near each other like fishing. NPC likes or \"weekly wants' change weekly (IRL time every monday) so you have ample time to acquire items to increase your friendships or to progress your budding romances. \n\nMy main qualms are the myriad of lil bugs & glitches: \n\n- Lighting tends to freak out when going from an indoors to outdoors (or vis vers), \n- Some terrain forgets its not supposed to be visible to a small hill becomes the only terrain in your personal plots back area, Going a certain depth into water tells the game to unstuck you with a blackout but if you jump or move out of that depth it freaks out and flashes you,\n- Certain areas either do not have the climbing rule applied to it trapping you in between terrain or in water,\n- Certain areas you should be able to jump but are incapable of traversing for no apparent reason.\n- There is also issues with the fishing indicator as you cast, the way it blinks makes it hard to track how far it has gotten and the speed in which the cast moves doesn't help that.\n- If you upgrade your home by adding a room, if the existing room's wall has items on it they will disappear. You have to leave the game then log in and check your storage.\n- Some loot when dropped by the creature/tree/whatever will become invisible and you have to use your HUD's compass whilst frantically mashing F to find it.\n\n\nYet in spite of all that I find myself hopelessly addicted in my special interest hyper focus way. I can get enough enjoyment in daily minutia & ongoing stories to keep me playing.\n\n\nPlayers from before my time tell me that this used to be a passion project worth following, but that now it just sits there rotting just finding new ways to convince you to spend money. A lot of the issues I have with the game are issues that have persisted for quite a while unfixed, as long as they can continue to make money then it hasn't been worth the newer owners' time. For this reason my wallet will never be open to this game.\n\n\nIts a good game, could be a great one if it put in the work, but still worth my time at the very least until I find another that can provide the quality changes & future goals worth investing in.",

It's like if Fantasy Life and Stardew Valley had a baby that was an MMO. You have the freedom to choose which skills of many you'd like to advance in the most, a super fleshed-out social system with relationships that feel like they build across both multiple in-game and real-life days, a story that is pieced together slowly across fun puzzles over dozens of hours of play, and a world full of friendly people that feels full but is big enough to not feel crowded. 11/10 can't wait for the Elderwoods update!",

          "review": "Been playing about a week now. First time this genre of game. It's pretty decent. There are quite a few bugs that can get annoying. Seems devs may be focused a bit more on cosmetics than fixing bugs in updates, from what I've seen and heard. \n\nIt's in beta. It will get fixed. Loads of play value here. In-game community has been fantastic. No toxic kids like most games. Everyone just talking maturely and helping one another out, very nice to see in-game.\n\nThe story progresses nicely in the beginning, but within about 3 (irl) days once you get to the Watcher quest, things slow down DRAMATICALLY. My guess is lack of content after the whole Watcher questline, but it's literally like hitting a brick wall. I feel initial gameplay needs to be slowed down quite a bit for the moment as it doesn't take much atm to progress. The longest thing so far is finding a Shepp which involves a lvl 4 friendship which is my last remaining Main Quest (all sides so far completed).\n\n7/10\nFix the bugs continue with content updates and it'll be a 10/10 in no time. Highly addicting and just chill relaxing game.\n",

I like the music, the world is peaceful to be in as a run around mining, gathering and cooking. The story so far seems interesting. The npcs are fun. My only real complaint and its kind of a big one, is I cant fish. I mean i know how you are supposed to fish but it just isn't working. for whatever reason my mouse doesn't move the line to keep it into the circle area. Honestly even if it did, its overlly complicated for a game built like this. Everything about this game is pretty simple except fishing. Why? idk. I want to catch fish I don't want to struggle to keep something in some tiny circle or fail. Even the cooking is extremely easy with the puzzles etc. Idk if its a pc thing but my mouse wont allow me to fish. I have tried at least 30 times and it just doesn't work.",

It is a fantastic game to play with friends, and the number of times I have had or seen beautiful interactions with complete strangers in the game warms my heart. Genuinely, the game makes me feel that the world could be a nicer place if we are just nicer people ourselves. \n\n10/10, would recommend, only free-to-play game I have ever chosen to spend money on.

          "review": "Okay, so this is a bit complicated. Please bear with me.\n\nI was there for the announcement of Palia. And for the beta. I shared my link, told all my friends, cuz the game idea was amazing to me. I legit could NOT wait to play it. When the beta opened, I worked *really hard* to get my laptop's graphics intel updated, downloaded all the packs, etc. It was a headache, but I was *so sure* it would be more than worth it. After all, the game description had been everything I had wanted in a game.\nWhen we tried the beta, we were disappointed. We understood that this was just beta and were trying to give grace for early game development, but the controls were confusing, it was so laggy (taking FOREVER to load anywhere and kept kicking us), and we didnt feel like we were getting anywhere after hours of play. When we tried the shop for strength to press on? No way. Prices were WAY too high.\nWe ended up putting the game down, and I told myself it would be better when it released on Switch, where the controls would at least be more familiar for me. So I waited again. Eventually, it released, and I was excited to see the improvements.\nBut it wasnt much different. I found it incredibly difficult to feel engaged. I was still disappointed in the character design options, which, while better than a lot of games, was not offering what I wanted for my character look. And the shop was just so bad. To pay for a single outfit in the shop, you have to pay at least $15. That seemed bizarre to me, as I have had experience in Toram Online (another F2P game) and Rune Factory, Story of Seasons, Animal Crossing, and FFXI (non F2P games). Palia doesnt have SO many mechanics that the others do, yet the only way to get cool outfits here is to pay, with ridiculously high prices. Even with the MagiMarket event, we just couldnt find the zeal to play.\nI put the game down again and ended up removing it from storage on Switch (the sheer storage space it took up was utterly unsustainable for me). Something like a year has gone by, idk. I decided to try Steam and see what had changed. I endured the re-updating my laptop graphics (~2 hours), and, boy-- How is it STILL this glitchy and laggy? At least it didnt keep kicking me, but it was still noticeably bad. And the shop hasnt gotten better-- if anything, it's worse. No new free cosmetics (or character customization), no access to free pets, the prices are terrible and even apply to stickers now, the layout was still unintuitive, and I also couldnt find any way to change usernames. At every turn, the game has features locked behind a paywall, and to those arguing that the payable items aren't \"functional\"-- that depends on what you're calling function. There're no combat/pvp aspects in Palia, marketing itself as a chill sim-type game. That means having nice outfits, cute companions, cool land terrains, and stickers/emotes are ALL parts of the core *functions* of the game (literally all related to the very appeal and substance of the game). But I digress. I tried to see the rest of the game by itself, treating the shop like DLC. Yet despite spending 4-5 hours of dedicated play this time, I barely got my house built, not a single relationship moved beyond level 1, I kept having to run all around (which takes FOREVER) for quests just to get one baby step forward, and spent an unreasonable amount of time just waiting on things like wood planks to process. I'll say, some features seem to have improved, and I think a couple of mechanics were added, changed, or streamlined (all good), but a lot less than I would have expected for the time elapsed. There were certainly countless of added shop items. Surely a few more mechanics, maps, or free stuff could have been expected? And Twitch drops kind of feel similar to a paywall. Like, \"Sure, we'll give you a few cute things occasionally, but only if you come promote our socials and add money to us by engaging in our content\". Not that they're the only ones who do this, but it becomes more apparent with the rest of the frustrations. \nBefore anyone mistakes me as a hater: The concept is great. They have several clever ideas, and I enjoy the aesthetic vibes. As much as the sim-ish look and over-the-top expressions bother me, the devs did seem to have put a lot of effort into personality, story, and design for each NPC. I sincerely applaud that. I get what people mean when they say, \"It's F2P, so just buy a couple of outfits from the shop and consider it the payment for the game to support the devs\". But the prices are so high, and the rest of the gameplay so weak and so slow. If I attempted to purchase enough outfits to make me content with a purely aesthetic game and counted it as the adjustable cost for the game, I would feel as though I had purchased a half-finished game. This isn't beta anymore. It shouldnt be this bugged or laggy, and it shouldnt be so slow and grindy. I like that it has room to grow, but there are some lessons Palia can learn from similar games like Sky CotL. Like it or not, the cosmetics are a large portion of appeal to an rpg-- that's why so much attention is put on them. Sky is a similarly story-driven sim-type F2P game, and it doesnt have all the npc interactions or farming-sim (though they did recently add customizable housing). The beauty, story, music, character design, and co-op gameplay make Sky highly appealing to so many people. Recently, their biggest issue has been varying currencies that have lessened the chill aspect and made it feel too grindy, losing a lot of people (even I barely play now) while also raising prices and feeding off FOMO to drain their audience. Toram is amazing for F2P, and it's brought me to literal tears over their gacha odds, losing me in the process. But they have so much more going on than Palia. And there are SO many free cosmetics, not just gacha, dyeable and adjustable. And Niki's Dressup similarly does a gacha thing, though the scarcity of resource and grind of gameplay was what lost me there too. If you're seeing a trend, it's because there is one.\nPlease dont misunderstand me-- I 100%-ed EoW and have ungodly numbers of hours on BotW and TotK. I'm also combing through post-game Hogwarts Legacy for every Merlin Trial, Vault, Quest, etc. I do not mind grind, effort, or time, but the journey should be nearly as enjoyable as the destination, or else the rewards are empty/effort unsustainable. This applies to co-op functions, character customization, payable content-- All of it should be giving the player a sense of enjoyment in the actual play. The grind may be taxing but it's still fun. You may have to cough up some money for some payable content, but it feels worthwhile and not overbearing. You should be able to tell a story with your character design-- that's the whole appeal to custom characters at all. We want it to feel like us or whatever we're trying to be. Whatever we're trying to voice. A game should not feel like work or it ceases to be a game. Games are meant to be fun, uniting, and fulfilling. I wish the gaming industry would not forget this. I know games are still products that must be marketed, but dont forget the value of the product in the effort to make value out of it....\n\nI genuinely WANT to love this game. I still think it has so much untapped potential. My hope is that perhaps the devs will research to find what works that love-of-the-game more so into Palia. I hope that one day I can return again to this game and find the journey to be genuinely fulfilling. I could say that maybe this game just wasn't designed for me, but not only are there numerous functional errors but also so many other voices repeating the same things. I sincerely wish the best for this game.\n\nWishing all the best and much love,\n\n~LilKetsi~\n\nEdit: I am seeing more potential and am powering through. I still wish I could answer neutral, but for now we shall see....",

Only problem I've been having is that weird crash \"pure virtual function called while application is running (GIsRunning == 1). So that's been very frustrating. \r\n\r\nThe game was running fine, and I decided to change my settings down a bit after a few hours of playing. I looked at a recommendation for best running on low spec pc and it said to switch to DirectX 11. After I did that, this crash has been happening almost non stop. I either can't get IN the game past the initial loading screen, or it crashes mid game after a little under an hour. \r\n\r\nSo, I'd say, if you have a low spec pc, be careful with messing with the settings because my game was fine until I did that :( I've done the force run dx11 by going into properties on steam and typing in -dx11 and it helped me get back into the game, but then it just crashed again after 30 minutes :') \r\n\r\nVery fun and enjoyable game otherwise!!!",

          "review": " The game can be kind of super buggy sometimes but that's mostly just with visuals like the UI, models not showing up (rejoin the game to fix that bug), player and npc models going through the floor, and sometimes I'm unable to click on specific UI. I've never experienced serious lag or have had any issues with data not being saved- I've seen negative reviews on that but I personally have never dealt with that. The game is insanely addicting and there's so much you can do and it's all for free. All you have to pay for is cosmetics- which, in my honest opinion, is pretty seriously overpriced. I'm aware that cosmetics are the only way the devs can make money off this game but an outfit being $25 USD is insane, I don't care lol. I want to support the devs and I have spent money in the game, but it is genuinely ridiculous to me. But the base game is free and there isn't any p2w or paywall for more content behavior going on, so I don't really mind that. You can do every single thing the game offers all for free and it's a pretty big game. I'm sure some of the quests may be boring or frustrating for people (me included) but I believe the game offers enough, even if I paid for the game I think I would still find massive enjoyability in it so the fact that it's free is very generous just in my opinion, at least. The villagers are so sweet I love getting to know them, even the ones I don't like right off the bat, I learn more about them over time and it gives me such a good understanding of their character type and the village's general vibe and it's honestly so nice. I highly recommend this game, I've never played something this fun and addictive before. My only real complaint is that the premium shop is overpriced (completely). Again, I know that's how they make their money but damn. Borderline every item (like an outfit) is $20 minimum...I don't think the price points are defendable lol.\r\n\r\nAlso the game mechanics are actually really nice! The fishing minigame is smooth and doesn't require you to hurt your hand clicking which is very nice and pleasant because every other game's fishing minigame requires stuff like that which is obnoxious. Also there's Einar. Best robot.",

          "review": "Such a cozy game with a pleasant community. Even in early release I've really enjoyed my time playing. Decorating your own plot feels very similar to Animal Crossing, and you even get to tour other plots to check out what others have done. I happily gave money to this little free to play game, to ensure that the devs can keep improving it!\r\nAll that said there are some rough parts. The controller support is very early stages and I'll have moments where the game does not respond to my controller, though it's largely just been a minor inconvenience. The most obnoxious time is when I'm cooking and I'll chop one or two ingredients then the next one will not recognize my controller and I'll have to switch to mouse. But I've never had an issue with the controller that's hindered me while fishing, hunting or bug-hunting! And speaking of early access, there are bugs in the game play like one of the games not working right during the festival week, which can only be remedied by exiting and re-entering the area, at which point you've already missed half the game.  And sometimes you'll try to enter a new area and the loading screen will spin for a bit then pop you right back where you were, so you have to try again. Mostly annoying if you're trying to get somewhere at a specific time, but never takes more than a single attempt before it response correctly.\r\nBut that said all my complaints can easily be tied to it being early access, and I'm confident that they're working on fixing these bugs!\r\n\r\nWhat others have said about it being grindy are true, and that's not for everyone, but I quite enjoy it. Because in this game there's a reward for the grind, and it never takes to long to get what you're looking for.\r\nUnless you're looking for silk. That's always a slog. \r\n\r\nLooking forward to seeing more of what this game has to offer as it continues improving!",

          "review": "The game was very fun to play at first. \r\nHowever, after spending quite a bit of time playing. I feel as though the progression can relate to building a base on Clash of Clans. It can almost feel annoying needing to grind so much to craft furniture and decorate your plot. Some higher tier resources can be very difficult to find. I have played over 100 hours and progress has felt so slow. I go on expeditions to gather resources and will spend an hour in real life gathering them- only to be able to find enough things to craft one piece of furniture. Which I might not even be able to craft since smelting some of the ore can take a couple hours in real life depending on what it is. The cash shop is extremely expensive- an outfit can cost $30-$50 USD and is only cosmetic. It would be cool if pets had unique quirks or abilities but they are also only cosmetic. You play and grind and its a lot of fun but you get to a point where finding resources is so difficult and time consuming that you lose motivation to play. There are also quite of few random bugs which I have never really dealt with before. Buildings going invisible, stairs not necessarily becoming invisible but my character will disappear and then reappear at the bottom. Their is practically no story which is also kind of a bummer. Whatever quest there are feel somewhat repetitive and anti climatic. Building relationships with villagers takes a long time so much so I don't remember the last time i did a quest. The quest will have you running around the whole map which can get pretty annoying as well. After playing for some time if this game had costed anything I dont think I would have bought it knowing what i do now. It was fun- but now things can take multiple hours in real life to complete- similar to clash of clans which has caused me to completely lose motivation.... again fun at first but only if you have A LOT of time to spare to play and grind for resources. I have put 109 hours into this game and am STILL barely making any money from farming apple trees and other resources as well. Not sure if I will keep playing anymore which is a bummer because the concept was there but I am assuming new management? has completely shifted the focus to in game purchases.",

All I have to say is more quests, more plushies, more pods, more Makeshift, more abundance of shrooms and other gatherables, more events, easier time obtaining Maji Market tickets, more hairstyles and character customization options, more endurance and speed for climbing, more control when fishing, more types of bugs and fish, etc. I'm sure I have more more`s, but that's good for now. :) I'd like cheaper clothing in the premium shop. I do find them too overpriced.",

It's fun and challenging and I hope to be in Palia for a long time to come. Can't wait to see it evolve and the potential for new areas and discoveries fulfil itself.\n",

Because this big arse crosshair also blocking the screen view when you enable the always on for reduce motion sickness...it should be just a single dot crosshair when not doing hunting or bug catching seriously!\n- Copper ore only drop 2 ore per mining and the amount is the same when mining the smallest rock and biggest rock...you need 5 ore to make a single ingot...it is difficult to find the ores already! This need to be changed to give more ores!\n- There's some bugs make world invisible that you can fall through the ground.\n- Wish there is player trading.",

          "review": "Really enjoying Palia so far. A lot of reviews mention bugs, and there definitely are some, but it's not nearly as bad as some people make it sound. It's entirely playable right now, but maybe it wasn't before I started.\n\nIt's very cozy, each villager has their own personality, there are a lot of quests, and it has a pretty decent overarching story. You can do whatever you want and take your time with just about everything. You get benefits from playing with friends, but you don't miss out on anything by playing solo.\n\nThe only thing I'd really like added is more progression. Even just something like 1 more tier of tools and the things to make them would be awesome. The next big update might just do that since there is supposed to be an entirely new area.",

The main story is intriguing and some of the mini-games are unique and enjoyable--cooking is great. And when you get to the underground, Hot Pot is addictive and well-worth spending and in-game night on.   It's an MMO, which you rarely see in this genre, but while you are encouraged to team up, you can definitely play solo, if that's your style. \r\n\r\nOnly potential downsides are it does get a bit grindy trying to keep up with all you need to build, but that's to be expected with something you can really put your mark on.  And it does seem to lack any sense of danger, but that's minor at best.  \r\n\r\nOverall, great game.  It has micro-transactions for cosmetic purposes, but it's definitely no pay-to-win.  If this is your type of game, it's a fine addition to your game list.",

However, the late game experience suffers from a lack of engaging content and repetitive tasks.\n\nPoints for improvement:\n\nEndgame Content: Introduce new challenges, goals, or systems to keep players engaged after maxing out tools and levels. \n\n1. Challenging dungeons or raids: Offering unique rewards and requiring strategic group play.\n2. Competitive modes: Introducing PvP or ranked leaderboards for various activities.\n3. Crafting Revamp: Adding more complex and rewarding crafting recipes with rare materials.\n4. Endgame Storylines: Developing new quests and storylines that delve deeper into the game's lore and offer meaningful choices.\n5. Resource Gathering: Reevaluate the tedious nature of resource gathering.  \n6. Increased drop rates: Make rare resources like palium ore more readily available.\n7. Alternative acquisition methods: Introduce quests, trading, or alternative activities to obtain resources.\n8. Streamlining gathering mechanics: Reduce the number of steps involved in gathering certain resources, like silk.\n\nNarrative Development: Enhance the story with\n\n1. More compelling characters: Develop characters with deeper backstories, motivations, and relationships.\n2. Meaningful choices: Introduce choices that impact the story and world in noticeable ways.\n3. Environmental storytelling: Utilize the game world to tell stories through hidden details and lore.\n\nBy addressing these points, the game can provide a more fulfilling and engaging experience for players in the long term.",

But I had so many questions, if he hadn't been there I probably would've uninstalled it again. It's  little buggy/laggy for me but still a super cozy gaming experience with a decent amount of things to do. \n\nI will say it bugs the absolute crap out of me that I had to start playing on a different steam profile in order to start a new save/character. I didn't want to start playing again on a save that I had initially started a year ago. Total pain in the ass. Forever waiting for them to either fix that or introduce a multiple save option. \n\nAll in all 7/10 because it's free to play so it's worth the try. \n\nFree to play probably also explains why the cosmetics are SO expensive.

Finally, the wholesome atmosphere is really good at helping me ignore the dumpster fire of American politics right now.\r\n\r\nI haven't purchased any in-game content, but I going to very soon. I like the business model of this game and I hope it works for the developers. It seems more than fair and it's great that those with means can support a nice game while allowing those with less to enjoy it just as much.",

I absolutely adore the individual NPCs and the options to romance a significant amount of them. I also truly admire how the husband/wife couples and the father/daughter couple both bring so much life to the game!. So many romanceable games I feel like don't highlight the family aspect of life anymore. I truly get so much wholesome vibes from how Badruu, Dalilah, N'ao and Auni react, truly a wholesome little family. I also love the different events the team has been popping out as of recently. Absolutely beautiful game! highly suggest it! I've converted 4 of my friends to join me in my Palia adventures and they were all obsessed from day 1.",

          "review": "Fun 3D copycat of Stardew. Plenty of bugs, which is why it's still beta. I would pay for cosmetics but they're overpriced even at 50% discount and they don't look that great on other players I see. Most of the time the tricked out shinies just show as ghost generic avatars. I'd pay for farming square increases without starting a whole new plot, or being able to sell furniture instead of trashing it, or better house options. \r\n\r\nAs is, the game would be solid if it didn't require server connection that cuts out a lot. I've clocked server loss intervals as fast as every 15 secs some days. Also, some of the server hosts post odd messages sometimes. But overall a good game.",

The quests that require other people to complete can be easily done, because practically everyone helps out, no strings attached, when someone asks!! And they're actually fun to do (in my opinion. I love team cooking lol). \r\n\r\nThe community is really great. I haven't seen any spam bots or trolls after 83hrs of gameplay; and at daily events everyone is so polite and eager to share the spoils.\r\n\r\nAlso it'S free to play and NOT pay to win! There are microtransactions, but for cosmetics only.\r\n\r\nOnly con I have so far is the lack of diversity for character creation. I'd love to see different body types (skinny, muscled, fat, tall, small, etc.) and noses other than the button/d*sney style. Idk if the devs have mentioned this in their updates, but I think it would be a good thing to add in the future.",

I just know that I didn't realise that it was online multiplayer with strangers and that is not for me.\nNo blame attached to the game or its developers, of course, I could easily have found out before installing. \nUnfortunately I trusted a recommendation for a cozy-style game that did not mention that it was always-online and features the general public visible and active in your game experience. \nSince that's what turned me off Diablo IV and Fallout 76, I have no desire whatsoever to play a game with randoms wandering around in it.",

It's a lot like Stardew Valley, but in a 3D MMO environment. The community is nice and for the most part works together for resources. I like that it doesn't rush you to get things done in a certain order. You can fish all day and you're not missing out on special events for example. Your farm is there when you get to it, nothing will die. Now that I'm back to work the passive income from seeding potatoes and jarring tomatoes and apples is huge, I came home to a 9k gold output. I will admit it may be too grindy for some people but I personally like grindy games.",

You can do it all in this game, from hunting and fishing, to growing crops and catching bugs. It is an amazing, cozy adventure and there is no time crunches or having to worry about dying and losing your inventory. I highly recommend playing Palia! AND, its great for all ages and families.",

It's just like playing The Sims, but you have quests, play online, and with other people. The game is \"FREE\" to play. The only money you will spend will be for the costumes, pets, gliders, and different overlays for your tools. They have no real use, they are just aesthetics. Which are hard not to buy. I did buy a few. \n\nThe only issue I have with the game, is with some of the players. Some players like to \"shame\" others for not sharing a resource. They also tend to gang up and \"shame\" players. Obviously, these are the same individuals who think that everyone should get a trophy for participation, even though their team lost! The same people who hide behind their keyboards and bully people. I allowed my little cousin to play with my character and she came crying to me that someone online said mean things to her (she is only 6). Don't say anything to them! STAY CALM! You don't have to share resources, but it is polite to share (only if you want to), it is not a \"RULE.\" Just block them, and if you want to, you can report them for harassment. Only if!\n\nOver all I give the game 8 out of 10 stars.",

The game gives you so much creative freedom not just with the way you can decorate but what you can build too! Don't want a cottage? Build a treehouse or even a castle! The community is super friendly and welcoming to new players; never seen a more united community in any MMO before. The only downside thus far is the lack of maps but I'm sure that will change in due time. If you're looking for a super cozy game to ease down your anxiety or relax after a long and stressful day, this is the one.",

Expect a lot of that if you make the mistake of trying to be real and have fun in this game. :)\n\nOverall, the game is unplayable in many ways. I focus on the fact that it is a technical mess and overall unappealing.\n\n(The ideological term speak with stuff like \"body type\" and \"type A' and \"type B\" instead of 'man' and 'woman' makes this game unappealing in both fiction and non-fiction universes. Definitely do not let your impressionable kids play games like this one without supervision. Show the right things, not Palia that is some ideologically infested dogma project. )\n\nRuns like a dead donkey in a tar funeral... on ice. 8 GB recommended my donkey - I have that on Win10 and it crashed during the intro cutscene following the character creation first time around. After that it was just a laggy mess.\n\nA fun fact: you cannot disable anti-aliasing in this game - your screen will turn into a black box. Oh joy. It is super unoptimized even though it looks worse than most 20-yo games.\n\nThe loading times are horrendous with a non-SSD game and it wastes much more RAM than it claims to require.\n\nThe user interface feels floaty. There is no polish to it. I could not select axe that I had for some non-explained reason.",

Farming for cooking ingredients, mining for gold, silver, copper, and iron, hunting, fishing, and chatting up the villagers keeps you on the move. But, if you prefer to spend time creating your home and improving your plot, that option is also available and really fun. People are generally nice and will readily answer questions if you need some guidance. You can also gather a party together to do all the tasks if you like social stuff. For loners, or on days you just want to chill and spend some quiet downtime, no one will bother you. It's a great game for everybody and for all levels of players.",

          "review": "Very fun to sink time into if you like  laid-back games with strong multiplayer focus. Most of the game is made of fetching things for villagers and building a nice home. Some people might see this as a fetch quest oriented game. I personally enjoy the quest oriented system, the dialouge is so much fun and there's strong worldbuilding to discover alone or with friends. The friendship system requires real work, tied to actual real world time. (one gift an irl day) this is a good incentive to keep coming back. \r\n\r\nKeeping in mind that this is a Beta, I think the following additions would make the game a ton more enjoyable:\r\n\r\n1) The farming system needs some love. Currently, the extent of farming progression is to unlock better tools and about 3 new crops. The system of crops effecting the growth around them is very unique and fun and i just wish there was more to it and hope that  future updates will provide some sort of rare seeds or cross breeding plants ect ect, really  just anything that means i can grow things not found in easily acessible stores.\r\n\r\n2) I dislike the fact that the fashion system is entirely payment focused on microtransactions. if there wasnt a whole character dedicated  to clothing i wouldn't mind, but it makes me sad that there's nothing for me to craft and learn from with Jel like so many other characters. There are so many quests where you help Jel make an article of clothing but you never get to see or equip anything he makes as far as I know. Buying fancy cosmetics is fine, but community clothing would really up the game, if this isn't possible it would still be great to be able to make clothes with your loom, even if they were simple. if this also isn't possible I think everyone would be happy to buy some in-game currency priced outfits from jel's shop.",

The NPC's are fun and have nice individual personalities. I wish there was more to do with the hunting and mining. I feel like they could really dive deeper into the farming side of the game fore sure. I think the prices for the premium cosmetics is actually insane and the only thing I've bought so far is Zeki's daily login bonus. I was interested in getting the premium cosmetics but it's way too expensive for me. I hope to see them add more and more options to the game. Maybe more areas to explore, more characters to meet. Things like that. If you want something cozy and easy to play though then this is a good game for you.",

I'd rather pay for a game that actually has full, fun customization options, than download a free game and spend a sh*t ton of money on outfits. Characters didn't peak my interest anyway. Tbf I only played 3 hours so maybe it's a good game but every other game like its kind, or games I thought it was like (Sandrock, Stardew, etc. type games) caught me from the get go. This didn't. Also couldn't care less about the online aspect, just annoyed at constantly having to wait in loading screens because \"2 other palians\" are before me or whatever.",

Here are the Pros from what I have seen:\n- Relaxing music & Gameplay\n- Interesting characters and a great art direction\n- Fun fishing mechanics\n- Decent crafting mechanics\n- Good character creation.\n\nIt takes out a lot of the stress of other games of its nature that would make your character crash from exhaustion or give you the ability to soft-lock yourself. While I don't care for the multiplayer, it's cool that you can chat and trade with others. Now for the Cons:\n- Controller Support is clunky\n- Minimap is not great\n- Some tutorial directions are odd with their wording.\n\nBut that's really it? Overall it was something I was able to easily pour a couple of hours into mindlessly. And I had fun.",

S6 truly feels like being part of a family. Everyone works together. The seniors/leads are very kind and patient in explaining technicalities and they make sure you understand the reason for things to work the way they do. \n\nIf you want to learn and grow in your discipline, S6 is the place to do it. Not to mention you'll get to work on some amazing content!\n\nThe best part of it all, in my opinion, is the team dynamics. Being a skilled professional is important, but couple that with a great personality and you have the perfect colleagues. I did not meet a single employee at S6 that did not fit this bill.",

Some folks became ill from overwork.\n\nLeadership had and still has very little diversity, which is painfully noticeable in the type of decisions taken.\n\nTeam structuring creates massive silo-ing and strong \"our team vs. yours\" in terms of output. Very little collaboration is possible, slowing the whole project down. Never worked at a place so inefficient.",

This applies to frontline managers all the way up to top leadership. This is despite parading a feedback culture. ICs who provide feedback have the feedback turned around and weaponized against them in performance reviews or elsewhere. The company is packed full of very talented ICs who are deprived of the support they need to succeed, and then blamed and take punishment when things don't go the way leadership wants them to. \r\n\r\n\r\n- Dishonesty and deceit is rampant in communication to employees. Never have I seen such a level of dishonest behavior from leadership, especially at such a small company. I can understand a need to be careful on what information to be transparent with, but the leadership very frequently, intentionally, and blatantly lies to everyone at the company about the state of the company. The sad part is that these lies are very shallow and most people see through them, but they serve their short-sighted purpose of keeping the illusion of the \"everything is fine\" dog. One example is telling everyone there will only be a few weeks of \"targeted overtime, not crunch\", knowing full well that it would last indefinitely for many.\r\n\r\n - Diversity problems explicitly ignored by leadership because it's not a \"priority,\" despite the large human impact of them. The company made big promises around D&amp;I to employees, and has failed to live up to them. And recently things have gotten much worse. \r\n\r\nThere are many other problems I did not list here. I fear that many more good people at the company will be hurt by the reckless course management is taking the company.",

Not to be afraid of being questioned and lashing out at those who do so.\r\n\r\nI never received any negative feedback in Lattice (our performance review tool) and never got an annual review in the 3 years I was there, never had a mention of being at risk or an underperformer, no PIP, nothing. Then had a personal disagreement with engineering leadership on topics they know are problematic in the company during a 1:1 and, the very next week, they fired me.\r\nThey also originally hid that it was a firing when they shared with the rest of the company until enough people reached out to me and learned otherwise. Then they edited the Slack message announcing my departure.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, I am not saying leadership failed by firing me. Sometimes firings are the best move (though, I do not personally think that is true in my case, you don't know). I am noting that why it happened, how it happened, and what things occurred and did not occur are all serious concerns for the company going forward.

We also spend exorbitant amounts of time making sure everyone is treated well, is happy, and works on tasks that they enjoy.\r\nThe company has gone through explosive growth in the past year while putting a lot of effort into maintaining that culture. \r\nProduction is stellar. No crunch so far, and lots of effort put well ahead of time to ensure it does not hit in the future.\r\nThe project is tons of fun. Everyone plays the game regularly. Players love it. Feedback is open, frank, and widely shared. Leadership listens. \r\nOne of the very few studios out there that is run by creatives, by folks who play and truly love the type of game we're making.

As we scale, know that this will require delegating that responsibility downward, relying on sub-teams to foster their own unique sub-cultures as inspired derivatives of the original Singularity6's culture. \nIn service of diversifying our team, I think we're finally making some steps in the right direction there - ensuring we're actively seeking a diverse candidate pool and now hiring for mid-level roles where previously we were only looking for senior candidates, but we've built quite an uphill battle for ourselves given the team we have now. We can do better here. I truly believe we could be a shining example of how diverse perspectives bring about the most amazing games.",

While S6 has done a remarkable job, particularly during a pandemic, at staying connected, we struggle with projects that require multiple-team coordination. This challenge is also well known and discussed, making it possible to try to improve things rather than just accepting it as it is. While I enjoy the challenge of helping shape how an organization collaborates, if you're looking for well-defined and stable team responsibilities, S6 may not be right for you. \n* While we talk openly about the challenges of creating a diverse workforce in engineering game dev, we are having a difficult time making progress in this direction. While I believe, given our values and culture of respect, people from underrepresented groups would flourish here, we haven't demonstrated the ability to hire diverse candidates yet. Part of this can be attributed to a very senior staff, which skews both our network and our candidate pool, but we need to do better in this space than we are now. \n* While work-life balance is good, it does require self-discipline to balance your time. This project is really exciting and we have a lot of passionate and engaged people. This enthusiasm is contagious and if you're not experienced at holding yourself accountable to other commitments it can absorb a lot of time. The upside is everyone is aware of this and is thoroughly supportive (like I mentioned above) of your away from work. We're in this for the long run.",

This extends from what it's like to build a game as a developer into what it's like to be a player of our game. \n* We think long term, doing what's important over urgent far more often than even large companies with stable budgets do. Our financial investors in the company make this possible too, keeping our focus on the long-term over short term gains. \n* The work-life balance is good, any extra time I dedicate to work comes from my own passion for the project. I'm actively encouraged by my leaders and peers to take time for family and myself. Taking an afternoon off because you've had a hard week is normalized. We have open PTO as well, which our leaders demonstrate taking time away from work is critical to our long-term success. \n* The game we're building is simply delightful, bringing a much needed warmth and coziness to the industry at a quality bar that makes me intensely proud to support building it.\n* We're building a live service game. We're here to build a relationship with our players that could last a lifetime. For a data practitioner, this means my contributions will be critical to our long term success, connecting developers to the players at-large in ways that can't be achieved with box product launches.",

The end result is an organization that is extremely rules-oriented instead of outcomes-oriented, using non-working rules and processes. The flow of work at S6 goes like this: if there's a process, we follow it, if there's not a process, we create one (either someone tries to replicate a process that existed at a company at least 10x the size, or someone copy-pastes \"best practice\" from a blog post, HBR article, or ChatGPT) and then follow that process forever, regardless of whether the process that was created is working or not.

While I enjoy the challenge of helping shape how an organization collaborates, if you're looking for well-defined and stable team responsibilities, S6 may not be right for you. \n* While we talk openly about the challenges of creating a diverse workforce in engineering game dev, we are having a difficult time making progress in this direction. While I believe, given our values and culture of respect, people from underrepresented groups would flourish here, we haven't demonstrated the ability to hire diverse candidates yet. Part of this can be attributed to a very senior staff, which skews both our network and our candidate pool, but we need to do better in this space than we are now. \n* While work-life balance is good, it does require self-discipline to balance your time. This project is really exciting and we have a lot of passionate and engaged people. This enthusiasm is contagious and if you're not experienced at holding yourself accountable to other commitments it can absorb a lot of time.

This extends from what it's like to build a game as a developer into what it's like to be a player of our game. \n* We think long term, doing what's important over urgent far more often than even large companies with stable budgets do. Our financial investors in the company make this possible too, keeping our focus on the long-term over short term gains. \n* The work-life balance is good, any extra time I dedicate to work comes from my own passion for the project. I'm actively encouraged by my leaders and peers to take time for family and myself. Taking an afternoon off because you've had a hard week is normalized. We have open PTO as well, which our leaders demonstrate taking time away from work is critical to our long-term success. \n* The game we're building is simply delightful, bringing a much needed warmth and coziness to the industry at a quality bar that makes me intensely proud to support building it.\n* We're building a live service game. We're here to build a relationship with our players that could last a lifetime.

Then they edited the Slack message announcing my departure.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, I am not saying leadership failed by firing me. Sometimes firings are the best move (though, I do not personally think that is true in my case, you don't know).

The company is packed full of very talented ICs who are deprived of the support they need to succeed, and then blamed and take punishment when things don't go the way leadership wants them to. \r\n\r\n\r\n- Dishonesty and deceit is rampant in communication to employees. Never have I seen such a level of dishonest behavior from leadership, especially at such a small company. I can understand a need to be careful on what information to be transparent with, but the leadership very frequently, intentionally, and blatantly lies to everyone at the company about the state of the company. The sad part is that these lies are very shallow and most people see through them, but they serve their short-sighted purpose of keeping the illusion of the \"everything is fine\" dog. One example is telling everyone there will only be a few weeks of \"targeted overtime, not crunch\", knowing full well that it would last indefinitely for many.\r\n\r\n - Diversity problems explicitly ignored by leadership because it's not a \"priority,\" despite the large human impact of them. The company made big promises around D&amp;I to employees, and has failed to live up to them. And recently things have gotten much worse. \r\n\r\nThere are many other problems I did not list here.

      "# [The Software Architecture of Palia](https://www.singularity6.com/news/software-architecture-of-palia)\nSingularity6’s debut game, Palia, is a free-to-play cozy online multiplayer community simulator. A place where players can play alone or with their friends to experience a beautiful and welcoming world which can be explored and personalized.\n\nSocial interaction and a persistent shared world are key features of the game. But these elements are also some of the most challenging to implement, scale, distribute geographically, and operate at minimal operational cost and negative player impact.\n\nPlayers experience the art and soul that our development team has poured into the game, but the infrastructure that makes it all possible behind the scenes is hidden from view. We are proud of what our team has accomplished with Palia, and we want to spotlight the studio’s hard work, including what players don’t experience directly. We also want to share some important lessons learned during our journey; we hope that sharing the lessons learned while developing Palia can be useful to others facing similar challenges.\n\nNow follow us behind the scenes of our Palia development journey!\n\nGame Engine\n\nBuilding an online multiplayer title from scratch benefits from a robust and proven game engine. We made the choice to build Palia using Unreal Engine. Unreal gives us powerful tools to build with out of the box, such as a strong networking and replication library to build social features, a graphics pipeline to build a beautiful world, a powerful physics engine that can simulate complex environments, and so much more. We use Unreal Engine for our game servers as well as our client, which gives players a real-time interactive environment.\n\nEach instance of the game server currently hosts up to 25 players, and we split up each server by what we call a map. These can be permanent fixtures, including our central hub Kilima Village, or even temporary available experiences, such as our Maji Market, which was only available for one month during our Luna New Year in-game event. When players travel between maps in Palia, the game client disconnects from one server and connects to a new one. We will share more details on how this works in our matchmaking service deep dive section.\n\nThis synergistic model is crucial for our team: we can develop most of the logic for Palia inside the engine and deploy to both clients and servers. This allows anyone on the team to test both the game and the game server in editor mode, which has been critical for our development velocity.\n\nSpotlight: memory leakage\n\nUnreal Engine servers are commonly used in “session-based games,” such as Fortnite: games that start and end within a certain amount of time. Memory leakage is not a big concern for session-based games because a new server is spun up for a new match and destroyed when the match ends. Any leaked memory will be cleaned before the next batch of players begin playing.\n\nPalia is a persistent shared-world game and the lifespan of our game servers is variable depending on how players move through the game world. A single game server may remain online and serve players for an entire patch cycle which could be weeks. Memory leakage which is cleaned up regularly for a session-based game can grow and compound, and small leaks might end up consuming two or even four times the amount of Random Access Memory (RAM) proportionally affecting our operational costs.\n\nTo combat this issue, we invested in solutions to help us identify memory leaks, and we spent useful time designing nudges for players to travel between maps as to increase the likelihood that a server would empty out and be shut down.\n\nUnexpectedly and fortunately, increasing geographical distribution helped with this problem: hosting servers near players not only helps with latency (because it reduces the distance that signals need to travel); but also with rotating empty servers because players tend to play at the same times, making it rare that somebody in that region is playing in the middle of the night and increasing the probability of servers to become empty, shut down, and cleaned.\n\nThis screenshot from one of our monitoring dashboards shows the memory usage of a portion of our game servers over a24h period in Feb 2024. The trend of linear memory increase is clearly visible.\n\nServices\n\nThe game client and servers talk to our services for specific actions, such as logging players into the game, loading characters, saving progress, sending chat messages to other players, making purchased outfits are stored in the player’s closet and many more.\n\nWe loosely follow a “microservice” posture, in which we prefer to host many different services specialized on one player feature.\n\nWe use HTTP as the North/South protocol (in and out of the datacenter) while we use gRPC for East/West communication (for services talking to each other inside the datacenter).\n\nWe use Rust exclusively as the programming language for our services and we try to include both integration and load testing as part of the definition of “done” for key services, including matchmaking, player presence and player state persistence which represent the largest percentage of our request load.\n\nOur unit and integration tests are also written in Rust, but we use Locust to support and execute our load tests. Locust load tests are written in Python which is simpler to program. The ability to quickly write and modify load tests was beneficial to us and sped up adoption.\n\nSpotlight: Rust for Microservices\n\nRust is a beloved programming language by many systems programmers because it provides state-of-the-art protection against common software vulnerabilities (buffer overflows and race conditions, for example) without introducing any performance penalties.\n\nRust is also a modern programming language. It is surrounded by a diverse and vibrant community of contributors and a wide range of libraries and tools. Documentation is excellent (especially onboarding tutorials) and the compiler is surely one of the most helpful and user-friendly.\n\nOf course, no programming language is perfect. Rust's posture is heavily focused on correctness, which is generally beneficial, but comes with a significant upfront cost which is visible in our development velocity. Rust makes it very hard to “cut corners” and punt hardening for later. It is a very good quality when something that was supposed to be just a prototype becomes load bearing in production by sheer pressure of business needs, but it makes it hard to move quickly and with agility around shifting requirements (which is a constant in startups and game development).\n\nThe other issue was hiring and onboarding. Rust’s relative youth as a programming language makes it somewhat difficult to hire people that have production experience with the language. Although the language is very popular, few people have used Rust in a professional team setting. Most people who have Rust experience have only used it for personal projects. With this in mind, onboarding took much longer than we expected. We factored 90 days to get engineers up to speed, but it turned out to take at least 6 months for most of the team to get comfortable and confident with the language.\n\nWe are very happy with the performance, latency, scalability, robustness and security of our Rust services. But there are moments when we wonder how much opportunity cost was spent in forcing up-front solidity of every piece of this layer.\n\nWe consider it an advantage for the studio to have managed to amortize those onboarding costs and the maintenance costs of our services is indeed very low, but those thinking of following our footsteps down the Rust path, should be willing to allocate a significant effort to education and onboarding. These costs will likely reduce over time as Rust becomes more popular in production settings, but it’s unclear what that rate will be.\n\nSeveral of our services are interesting and sophisticated enough to merit more attention: player state management and matchmaking.\n\nPlayer State Management\n\nWe consider player state all the information that a game server needs to recreate the most recent game world experienced by the player. The architecture of our game is server-authoritative which means that game servers decide the state of the world and act as referees when game clients report inconsistent data (for example, because of time delay in transmission). We took this route because Palia is a social game so a player cheating or modifying their state could have a negative impact on the experience of other players. The risk of cheating is reduced when it's our system that ultimately controls player state.\n\nThe simplest way to persist state is to wait until a player exits a game server and have the server send this information to the database. Unfortunately, this makes state changes in that server vulnerable to the server itself crashing and losing that data (which is only kept in volatile memory for performance reasons). Instead, several times a second we check for player state changes, and if there are any, that data is immediately queued and sent to the database to be persisted.\n\nSpotlight: data first vs. schema first\n\nA source of contention around player state is the modeling lifecycle: who and what decides what is valid to be stored into such a state? Traditional data-modeling techniques suggest a “schema first” approach: the structure of the data (the schema) is created ahead of time and then only data that conforms to that structure can be saved into the database.\n\nThis has the advantage that the database validates the shape of the data. The disadvantage is that one has to know ahead of time the structure of the data needed… which can be challenging to coordinate across different teams.\n\nTo increase the ease with which game engineers and technical designers could work, we decided on a different model in which the structure of the data would be decided in C++ structs directly within Unreal and then marshaled and persisted in the database as a binary blob (using the Flexbuffer format). The schema is the struct declaration itself and we use Unreal’s runtime type reflection system to export the schema to our database.\n\nThe advantage of this architectural choice is that it enabled game engineers to develop features that required state persistence without the need for constant coordination. The downside is that the data is opaque to the database, which is more expensive to keep uniform and consolidated. This has required us to invest in additional tooling around the player state management system to validate, backup, modify and correct player state when it diverges from the expected structure.\n\nDespite the additional layer of development investment needed to provide hardening on top of what the database normally provides, we believe this architecture has significantly cut down the time required to deliver new features with data persistence, such as our most recent Luna New Year event.\n\nMatchmaking\n\nIn many competitive-style online games, matchmaking is the process of selecting people for a match. For Palia, matchmaking means matching the player with the game server that we believe will give players the best gameplay experience.\n\nThere are several dimensions that we take into consideration during matching:\n\nLocation - how far away the game server is from where the player is currently playing (because closer server means lower latency and lower latency means a more fluid and immersive experience)\n\nFriends - how many of the player’s friends are currently playing on that server (because the more people they know the more meaningful their interaction will be)\n\nPopulation - how many people are playing on that server (because the more people are playing the more alive the world feels)\n\nThe matchmaking system is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing us to add more signals to the matching algorithm over time if we desire.\n\nAnother crucial feature of the matchmaking system is the ability to distinguish “join” requests and “travel” requests. A join request happens when a player starts the game and wants to join. A travel request is a match required by a player leaving one map of the game and traveling to another.\n\nThe ability to distinguish the two allows us to offer priority to “travel” requests when the system is under load and there is high contention. This is because it’s far less disruptive for players to wait a few minutes to join and then wait only a few seconds to travel between maps, than one in which the delays are spread uniformly across all matching requests.\n\nThis screenshot shows a piece of the dashboard we use to monitor queue sizes and the distribution of times it takes for a matchmaking request (join or travel) to be satisfied.\n\nSpotlight: game-aware internal queueing and autoscaling\n\nEvery empty server running in the cloud without a player on it is a waste of money. On the other hand, there might be players who want to play and all of the game servers have their allocated slots filled so they would benefit from an empty server to land in.\n\nMany online games design “login queues” or similar ways to restrict the inbound flow of players and scale up or down the number of servers to meet the demand. Originally, this was our intent as well, but we realized we would benefit from a more sophisticated matchmaking design that could distinguish between joining and traveling. We also realized that the matchmaker had all the information it needed to control the size of the game server fleet.\n\nThis is how we came up with the Admiral: a component of the matchmaking system that oversees the fleet of game servers. The Admiral understands when the current fleet of game servers is insufficient to satisfy the number of players requesting a match and is able to ask the underlying cloud system (specifically Agones) to request the creation of more game server instances. Agones, on the other hand, is responsible for shutting down game servers that have been empty for some time.\n\nThe integration of autoscaling with matchmaking and the separation of concerns between the Admiral (scaling up) and Agones (scaling down) has served us very well and has managed to provide us with shock absorption to the game when things didn’t go as planned. Several times, the elasticity of these queues between maps have saved the team from having to bring down the game entirely to fix issues during misaligned deployments or unforeseen behaviors during load spikes.\n\nThis screenshot shows the view of the game servers fleet from the Admiral. Each line is really two lines: one for the “desired size” and another for the “actual size”. This information is used to tell the cloud orchestrator to spin up more game servers for a particular map type as they are needed by players being matched to servers that don’t yet exist.\n\nData Management\n\nOur architecture of loosely coupled software components wouldn’t be very useful without data flowing between them and being persisted, validated, or aggregated.\n\nDatabases\n\nOne of the most difficult elements of creating a shared perpetual world is constructing the ability for players to influence it (and one another) in a context that feels immediate and consistent. A key factor to provide a positive player experience is the choice of the database architecture.\n\nWe decided to use ScyllaDB as our main data persistence layer. ScyllaDB is a C++ rewrite of Apache Cassandra (originally created at Facebook and, in turn, heavily influenced by Google BigTable and Amazon DynamoDB), a distributed column store.\n\nThe biggest advantage of ScyllaDB for us has been its elastic scalability and its cloud native “design for failure” posture that aligned very well with ours. One significant advantage of ScyllaDB for us is the ability to attach replication strategy to a table but eventual consistency levels to a query. This gives us a lot of flexibility because in some cases we need consistency more than we need speed and we can tune that directly at the query level. This is not possible with traditional relational databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL.\n\nThis functionality is crucial, for example, when dealing with a persistent player state: we want the data to be replicated on multiple computers before we return a response to the game server. This means that both the game server and multiple database nodes have to die (at the very same time!) for that player state update to get lost. As far as we can tell, this has never happened.\n\nWe also use PostgreSQL (hosted for us by AWS) for the catalog of our outfits available for purchase in the game. We used a relational database here because we felt it was better suited for this particular job.\n\nAsynchronous Messaging\n\nAnother important part of the data management layer is the ability of software components to message one another asynchronously.\n\nWe have two of such busses:\n\nThe first for aggregates and collects telemetry for player behavior (which uses Apache Kafka, more on this later) and feeds our analytics and machine learning pipelines.\n\nAnother coordinates software components (for example, the control plane between the fleet auto-scaler and the game servers). This uses EMQX as the broker and MQTT as the protocol.\n\nWhy two? Mostly because they serve different purposes, have different strengths and weaknesses, and are managed by different teams focusing on separate outcomes. There might be value in consolidating things further in the future, but for now this separation is serving us well.\n\nSpotlight: MQTT and Apache ActiveMQ v5 (aka Artemis)\n\nThe use of MQTT as the message bus protocol for our game servers control planes was decided precisely to isolate us from lock-in of a particular broker implementation. In retrospect, this was a weak choice: MQTT is an IoT protocol and we were attracted by the fact that it was designed for devices with small power and low bandwidth. We wanted a solution that would be easy and cheap for the game servers to interact with and didn’t consume a lot of their resources.\n\nUnfortunately, many MQTT brokers simply implemented that protocol on top of their existing native systems. We picked Apache ActiveMQ v5 (aka Artemis) because it was established and it supported v5 of the MQTT protocol (which offered features we needed) but was written and designed before clouds existed and turned out to be incompatible with our preferred “loosely coupled components expected to fail” architectural posture.\n\nArtemis has been the source of much apprehension and tribulation. We ended up having to patch the software to fit our needs. We operated with a forked version in production just to keep it from falling over regularly (the MQTT layer and cross-regional federation layers did not work well together).\n\nWe have since migrated to EMQX which is a more modern MQTT broker, designed from the ground-up with MQTT in mind and we have not looked back.\n\nThe lesson learned here is that even established and battle-tested software might still end up performing poorly when utilized in a different context and with different operational constraints than was originally intended.\n\nData Pipelines\n\nAnother important principle of our software architecture is that we want to be able to observe and monitor how the system is behaving so that we can act on it effectively when behavior deviates from the norm.\n\nWe treat data differently based on whether the decision making that it supports is latency sensitive or not. In fact, we use completely different systems for low-latency decision support (seconds to minutes) vs. high-latency (days or weeks).\n\nSpotlight: player behavior vs. system behavior\n\nIn the past, we separated data based on whether it was about player behavior or software behavior. But we quickly realized that distinction was not very helpful in practice.\n\nFor example, a purchasing event from a player is technically a player behavior and insights gathered from them influence strategic decision making with high-latency (days or weeks). But such a high-latency reaction would be detrimental to both our players and our revenue if we didn’t get notified immediately if the frequency of purchases dropped outside of the normal range of operation.\n\nIt is generally true that data generated from the behavior of players influences decision making in aggregate and with high latency while events generated by the behavior of software systems influences decisions and actions that require quick reaction times. But our ability to route data based on decision making latency needs and not on the semantics of origin has made it easier to reason about data routing decisions, especially when the two pipelines are handled by different teams with different skills, strengths, and goals.\n\nObservability\n\nWe picked Prometheus as the time-series database powering the low-latency data pipeline and alerting. The key advantage here is the “pull” model in which it is Prometheus to “scrape” data from our software components, which makes it a lot simpler to maintain.\n\nWe also use Grafana as our visual dashboarding system querying the data stored in Prometheus along with Loki and Tempo to deal textual logs and tracing the flow of execution across several of our software components.\n\nLastly, we use Sloth to automate the generation of SLOs.\n\nAnalytics\n\nThe high-latency data pipeline revolves around Apache Kafka (managed for us by Confluent) which captures and routes the data as well as Apache Spark (managed for us by Databricks), which we use to aggregate and analyze the data.\n\nWe use Apache Airflow (managed for us by Astronomer) for monitoring and scheduling long-running workflows for data aggregation and analysis. Lastly, we use Tableau to power the visualization of the insights that result from our data analysis.\n\nCloud Infrastructure\n\nAnother development challenge is the “free-to-play” nature of our distribution strategy. This approach made it difficult to predict the amount of players that would play the game, especially around key events, such as platform launches, major updates, and in-game events.\n\nWe decided to be “cloud native” from the start because “elasticity” in supply of computation and bandwidth is a key advantage that cloud providers have over acquiring and maintaining our own server infrastructure; especially for gaming startups (for which capital is constrained) and when deploying across multiple geographical regions.\n\nCloud native for us didn’t simply mean: “run our programs on somebody else’s computer.” Cloud native for us meant designing a software architecture composed of small pieces that are loosely coupled and always expected to fail.\n\nWe call this “designing for failure.” Of course, we never want our systems to fail. However, we believe that resiliency in software systems comes less from preventing failure, and more from providing mitigations to such risks and the ability to restore service as quickly and automatically as possible. We want to design to reduce failure but we always expect it to happen, so when it does happen, our systems would not be surprised by it.\n\nKey components of this strategy were using Kubernetes as our orchestration system, Linkerd as our service mesh, Traefik as our load balancer and Agones to manage our fleet of game servers. We also rely heavily on the “infrastructure as code” principle, using Kustomize to help us keep our configurations DRY and ArgoCD to power continuous deployments.\n\nKubecost helps us measure costs, and we recently swapped from cluster-autoscaler to Karpenter to optimize cluster elasticity and to help pick the best server instances. This change allowed us to save a non-trivial percentage of our cloud costs by automating the selection of instance types to use to run our workloads.\n\nFor provisioning infrastructure we rely on Terraform and Spacelift. We rely on Vault to store secrets without our cloud environments. We also conduct chaos testing using Litmus.\n\nAnd we rely on a few different services for authentication and authorization systems, including FusionAuth for account management, Zendesk for customer support management, Stripe for payment processing, and Vivox for our in-game chat system.\n\nOur only cloud provider is Amazon Web Services which provides us computers, storage, and bandwidth across multiple regions: United States, Germany, and Japan. We also rely on Cloudflare for geo-aware DNS and load balancing as well as DDoS protection.\n\nSpotlight: Nomad vs. Kubernetes\n\nWe had originally chosen Nomad as our orchestration solution, mostly because it was perceived to be conceptually simpler and it was much more compatible with Windows workloads (which we thought we might need for testing purposes).\n\nUnfortunately, Nomad had one very significant problem: the momentum of the development community around it was significantly smaller than around Kubernetes. This had two significant issues for us: a) we had to develop in-house solutions that the community around Kubernetes had already implemented; and b) it was harder to engage the team with a technology that many considered an evolutionary dead-end.\n\nWe made the difficult call to switch our cloud orchestration system by using the argument that our development velocity would significantly improve and our operational risks would be reduced. This turned out to be very much the case and it’s a decision we would happily make again.\n\nBuild Systems\n\nThere are two primary concepts used in the building of Palia and its supporting services: the build platform and the build system. Historically, game studios lumped these two together around the primary continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) component. We borrowed some plays from large-scale build and release systems beyond gaming: using a heavily distributed approach inspired by some of our team members’ experiences in other industries, such as banking.\n\nTo power the build system we use Jenkins, but take care to draw a distinction between the software, and the underlying infrastructure upon which it runs and integrates. While related, these things are best served by intentional, separate configuration management and Infrastructure as Code practices which can quickly become unwieldy and complex if attempting to do so under a monolithic design. The result is a hybrid cloud approach to the build system. We use both an on-prem data center and Amazon Web Services, and one side of the architecture can be maintained without potentially negatively impacting the other.\n\nWe also took the time to redesign the initial version of the build system (Jenkins pipelines) around Unreal Engine’s native tooling, namely, BuildGraph. Doing so required a lot of work up-front as the old method was cobbled together between Jenkins Pipelines and Python scripts, but the declarative nature of BuildGraph tooling has allowed us to increase correctness, reduce build system maintenance, and increase flexibility such that we can build almost every target platform with minimal specific changes for each. A key component of this success was integrating with AutoSDK and creating a “standard library” of sorts in Jenkins to glue it all together.\n\nIn our latest version of the build platform we are able to mostly dynamically scale the number of executors based on demand. The build system can then simply act as a “glue layer” to distribute requested tasks among the available executors as parallel pipeline runs. Further, we’ve incorporated designing for Self-Service by other teams, such that they can “pick and choose” which artifacts they want built via a single interface. We call this the “Prime Pipeline,” which presents a series of configurable parameters and then schedules the running of “Sub-Pipelines” to do the work, passing those parameters as appropriate. This means that via the same Prime Pipeline interface, one Engineer could choose to build only one Platform Client from the library of Clients available, and one Server, getting only those two artifacts; or they could select everything and end up with every Client and Server we currently offer as targets.\n\nSpotlight: Capacity Management in a Hybrid Cloud World\n\nA trade-off we make for this level of granularity and distribution is the initial difficulty in managing capacity. We use several build executors of different types and had to really break-down our pipelines and how each stage would be distributed to the executors both on-prem and in AWS. Then we had to measure a single run of each pipeline to get more accurate numbers to use for calculating instance sizes, costs, expected load, and timings for stage and whole pipeline execution. This cost us a lot of time up-front, and while we are glad we did it, it is yet another piece of operational overhead which must be monitored, reviewed, and adjusted in order to remain reasonably accurate. Changing something as simple as the Node Label of a particular pipeline Stage can have serious impacts to all of the metrics we measure, most notably, build times. Unfortunately, there aren't a whole lot of “drop-in” or “off-the-shelf” solutions for these types of systems, so we have had to track these things manually, and then automate as we go to attempt to reduce the operational burden.\n\nFurthermore, managing two different sets of infrastructure is not for the faint of heart, or those unfamiliar with Hybrid Cloud management. While the patterns may be very similar, the implementation proved to be a lot more work than we anticipated.\n\nFor example, AWS and other cloud service providers make APIs available to interact on a very granular level with their exposed components. On the other end of the spectrum, even the most mature on-prem infrastructure providers rely on their own custom tooling for managing hardware components. This is why projects such as Ansible are in such heavy use in the IT industry, and S6 is no exception here as we prioritize the use of open source tools where possible to ease cognitive load and keep costs low.\n\nThe challenge that made this most difficult was the disparity in experience using this approach on our team members’ time. Some of us come from more of a Platforming background, others from a Tooling background, and still others from primarily a Jenkins Pipeline writing background. This is great for general cross-functionality within the team, but requires careful planning to execute well even among the highest-performing teams.\n\nVersion Control\n\nWe use two different version control systems to manage the development lifecycle of our code: Perforce for the game code, and git (hosted in Bitbucket) for everything else.\n\nUsing different version control systems is clearly suboptimal and not a decision we took lightly: git is generally preferred by backend engineers and is far better supported by modern development environments.\n\nUnfortunately, Perforce is very well integrated in Unreal Engine because that’s what Epic Games uses (the makers of Unreal Engine). Also, git isn’t really designed to work with very large binary files, and a lot of our in-game assets and original sources are giant binary files. Perforce works well in these situations.\n\nEarly on, we tried using git-lfs (large file storage), which is supposed to help with this problem but we gave up when we realized how much effort it would be to retrofit all of the Epic development tools (UnrealGameSync, for example) to work with git.\n\nWe sincerely wish we had a single consolidated version control system and code review workflow, but it is not a trivial exercise.\n\nSpotlight: Consolidated Repos\n\nOne of the issues we faced with git was that it was too easy and convenient to create new repositories, causing a proliferation of them. The biggest issue we faced was the inability to make changes that cross-cut different services at once. This created a lot of production overhead and reduced our ability to consolidate the behavior of services.\n\nWe considered switching to a full “monorepo” but many of us were unfamiliar with it and feared additional complexity and overhead that we had no additional development capacity to support.\n\nThe compromise we reached was a handful of consolidated repos in which many individual git repositories were merged into a single repository and then archived. All the microservices ended up in this single repository, but they could be developed, built, tested and deployed in isolation. This made it much easier to modify code across services (such as version dependencies) as well as simplifying the creation of libraries. This approach facilitated an incremental externalization of common functionality into modules that could be more easily reused across services, reducing copy/paste code duplication and reducing our maintenance costs.\n\nSaaS-y Open Source\n\nOne common theme you might have noticed in our architecture is that we prefer to depend on software that is open source and that we could host ourselves if we wanted/needed to. We also prefer to rely on a SaaS vendor that provides and manages this software for us instead of running it ourselves.\n\nThis offers us several advantages:\n\nWe are not locked into a particular cloud or vendor provider (as we could run the system ourselves if we needed to).\n\nWe can provision systems more quickly (our people don’t need to learn the intricacies of configuring them).\n\nLeverage vendor expertise to fix issues and/or edge cases when we encounter them.\n\nKeeps the vendor prices under control under our threat of shutting down our vendor contract and hosting the system ourselves.\n\nWe deviated from this posture only rarely and when there was no open source alternative that made sense for our business needs. However, we do believe this paradigm worked well for us and provides a way to fund and support further development of these open source projects. This, in turn, lowers our future risks by helping make the development of these open projects more sustainable (as these hosting vendors often employ contributors to the open source projects and continue to fund their contributions for mutually symbiotic benefit).\n\nConclusions\n\nIt’s rare to get access to the source code that makes up video games, so it’s rare to have the opportunity to learn directly from it. Even rarer is a view into the decisions and tradeoffs, the lessons learned, the paths not taken and those taken but with later regret.\n\nWe hope that this deep-dive on the challenges and successes of creating Palia’s software architecture provides some insight and inspiration for others facing similar challenges.\n\nIf you have any questions about Palia’s software architecture and development, or simply if you want to start a conversation feel free to reach out to us at hello@singularity6.com.\n\nSpecial Thanks\n\nThe list of people that contributed to this architecture is very long (see the Palia credits for the full list) and we wouldn’t do it justice to replicate it here. Here, we thank the people that helped us contributing to our editorial (in chronological order of contribution): Kyle Allan, Anthony Leung, Adam Passey, Brian Tomlinson, Emily Price, Jordan Orelli, Michael Chance, Javi Carlos.",

We collect browsing information automatically when you access our websites.\n\nSocial Media Information: We collect this information automatically when you share information through social media widgets on our Services. We also collect it when you voluntarily provide it to us.\n\nMuch of the data is provided to us by you (through forms, when you communicate with us, or when you use our Services). You are not obliged or required to disclose data to us, unless you choose to continue using our Services.\n\nAs far as it is lawful, we may also collect data from public sources (for example the media, or the internet including social media) or receive data from service providers and other third parties in connection with your use of our Services or your interactions with us on other platforms.\n\n2. For what purposes do we process your data?\n\nWe generally process your data for purposes related to communicating with you, including responding to inquiries or to help you exercise your rights. For this purpose, we may use communication data, master data, and registration data in relation to offers and Services that you use. We keep this data for purposes such as documenting our communication with you, training purposes, quality assurance, providing our Services and any associated support for them including follow-up inquiries.\n\nWe process data for the administration and performance of contractual relationships including providing you with Services like Palia game functionalities. We may also use data to manage alpha, beta, or other forms of playtests and collect feedback.\n\nWe process data for marketing purposes and relationship management, for example to send you personalized advertising for products and services from us, some of which may be offered in partnership with third parties. This may happen in the form of newsletters and other regular contacts, through other channels for which we have contact information from you, but also as part of marketing campaigns and may also include free services.\n\nWe further process your data for data analytics, market research, to improve our services and operations, and for product development to improve the Services we provide.\n\nWe may also process your data for security and access control purposes.\n\nWe process personal data to comply with laws, directives and recommendations from authorities and internal regulations.\n\nWe also process data for the purposes of our risk management and as part of our corporate governance, including business organization and development. We may process your data for further purposes, for example as part of our internal processes and administration or for quality assurance purposes and training.\n\n3. On what basis do we process your data?\n\nThe legal bases on which we process your personal data depend on the Services you use and how you interact with them. We may ask for your consent for certain processing activities. You may withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future by contacting us through the relevant Service . Once we have received notification of withdrawal of consent, we will promptly cease processing your information for the purpose(s) you consented to, unless we have another legal basis to continue doing so. Withdrawal of consent does not, however, affect the lawfulness of the processing based on the consent prior to withdrawal.\n\nWhere we do not seek consent for processing, the processing of your personal data relies on the requirement of the processing for initiating or performing a contract with you or on our legitimate interest in the particular processing. Our legitimate interests also include compliance with legal regulations, insofar as this is not already recognized as a legal basis by applicable data protection law. This also includes the marketing of our products and services, the interest in better understanding our markets and in managing and further developing Palia, our other Services, and Singularity 6, including its operations, safely and efficiently.\n\nWe may process your data on other legal bases, for example, in the event of a dispute, as required in relation to a potential litigation or for the enforcement or defense of legal claims. We will communicate to you separately as necessary where such other legal bases may apply.\n\n4. What applies in case of personalization?\n\nWe may automatically evaluate personal aspects relating to you, where we wish to determine preference data, but also to detect misuse and security risks, to perform statistical analysis or for operational planning. We may also create profiles for these purposes, i.e., we may combine behavioral and preference data, but also master data, contract data and technical data relating to you in order to better understand you as a person and your experiences with our game.\n\nIn this case, we pay attention to the proportionality and reliability of the results and take measures against misuse of these profiles. Where these can produce legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affect you, we ensure human review.\n\n5. How do we share your data?\n\nIn relation to our contracts, websites, products and all other Services, our legal obligations or otherwise with protecting our legitimate interests and the other purposes, we may disclose your personal data to different parties, including:\n\nService providers: We may work with service providers in the US, Europe and other regions who process your data on our behalf. This includes for example hosting services. We disclose personal information to these service providers for a business purpose as legally permissible.\n\nParties you Authorize, Access, or Authenticate: Third parties you access through the services, social media services you use or other users with whom you communicate. For example, we work with businesses such as Stripe, in which case we do not share personal data, but allow the players or visitors to share their personal data directly with these parties. We then receive transactional information from the business e.g., if the payment or age verification was successful.\n\nContractual partners: This refers to contractual partners we may enter into partnerships or other contractual relationships with. For example, they may receive pseudonymized or anonymized registration data in relation to issued and redeemed vouchers or invitations. These recipients may also include contractual partners with whom we cooperate or who carry out advertising for us and to whom we may therefore disclose anonymized or pseudonymized data about you for analysis and marketing purposes.\n\nAuthorities: We may disclose personal data to agencies, courts and other authorities in the US and abroad if we are legally obliged or entitled to make such disclosures or if it appears necessary to protect our interests.\n\nDisclosure in Merger, Sale or Other Asset Transfer: In the event of a reorganization, dissolution, merger, sale or bankruptcy, we may transfer any information we collect to relevant third parties and will obtain your consent to do so where required.\n\nOther persons: This means other cases where interactions with third parties follows from the purposes, for example service recipients, the media and associations in which we participate or if you are included in one of our publications.\n\nIn addition, we enable certain third parties to collect personal data from you on our website and in our Services. Where we have no control over these data collections, these third parties are sole controllers.\n\n6. Is your personal data disclosed abroad?\n\nWhen you use our Services or access our websites, we may collect personal data about you which may be transferred, processed and/or accessed by us in the United States or any other country in which we or our service providers operate. Please be aware that the privacy laws and standards in certain countries, including the rights of government authorities to access your personal information, may differ from those in the country in which you reside. We will only transfer personal information to those countries to which we are permitted by law to transfer personal data.\n\nFor data transfers, Singularity 6 has taken the necessary steps to comply with applicable data protection laws to ensure that international transfers of data are carried out with an adequate level of protection by implementing an agreement incorporating the European Commission's standard contractual clauses.\n\n7. How long do we retain your data?\n\nWe generally store and retain your data for as long as our processing purposes, legal retention periods and our legitimate interests in documentation and keeping evidence may require, or where storage is a technical requirement. When determining applicable retention periods, we consider multiple criteria including the minimum requirements under applicable law, applicable industry standards and whether the data is required to prevent fraud, cheating or other forms of misuse of our Services. If there are no contrary legal or contractual obligations requiring otherwise and there are no further purposes for processing the data, we will delete or anonymize your data once the retention period has expired as part of our usual processes.\n\n8. What are your rights?\n\nApplicable data protection laws grant you the right to object to the processing of your data in some circumstances, in particular for direct marketing purposes, for profiling carried out for direct marketing purposes and for other legitimate interests in processing.\n\nYou may have the following rights depending on the data protection law(s) applicable to you:\n\nThe right to request information from us as to whether and what data we process from you;\n\nThe right to have us correct your personal data if it is inaccurate;\n\nThe right to request deletion of your personal data;\n\nThe right to request that we provide certain personal data in a commonly used electronic format or transfer it to another controller;\n\nThe right to withdraw consent, where our processing is based on your consent;\n\nThe right to receive, upon request, further information that is helpful for the exercise of these rights;\n\nThe right to express your point of view in case of automated individual decisions and to request that the decision be reviewed by a human.\n\nIf you wish to exercise the above-mentioned rights or have any questions relating to those rights, please contact us. For us to be able to prevent misuse, we need to verify your identity.\n\nIf you are located in the EEA, the United Kingdom or in Switzerland, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent data protection supervisory authority in your country, but we would appreciate the opportunity to address any concerns you may have and kindly request that you direct your complaint to us first.\n\n9.

      "# [How Singularity 6’s ‘Palia’ Conquered Cross-Regional Gaming with Amazon EKS and Karpenter on 2024-05-07](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/gametech/how-singularity-6s-palia-conquered-cross-regional-gaming-with-amazon-eks-and-karpenter/)\nIntroduction\n\nDeveloping an online multiplayer game capable of supporting thousands of concurrent players is an incredibly complex endeavor. For Singularity 6 (S6), creators of the hit game “Palia,” which released across platforms in 2023 and 2024—their developers needed to craft an immersive and captivating gaming experience while managing the vast resources and infrastructure required to keep the game’s services running smoothly.\n\nThroughout the development process, unforeseen obstacles and hurdles arose, testing the team’s resilience and problem-solving abilities. Furthermore, launching globally across console and PC platforms introduced an additional layer of intricacy, requiring planning and execution to ensure a seamless experience for players worldwide. To boost their small infrastructure team, S6 leveraged Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) and Karpenter’s flexibility and elasticity while minimizing cost—allowing Palia to reach over 3 million players in six months, in three different Regions, and across four distribution platforms.\n\nThis article describes the process the team at Singularity 6 used to make the Palia launch smooth and successful.\n\nOverview of Palia’s AWS infrastructure\n\nEarly on, Singularity 6 made the decision to host Palia on Amazon Web Services (AWS). As an online multiplayer game, the team understood that Palia needed a “cloud-first” approach. Today, Palia runs using Amazon EKS in three AWS Regions: US West (Oregon) – us-west-2, Asia Pacific (Tokyo) – ap-northeast-1, Europe (Frankfurt) – eu-central-1.\n\nPalia’s backend services run inside an EKS cluster, including the game servers powered by Unreal Engine. For persisting player state across a shared world, Palia relies on ScyllaDB as the database layer. ScyllaDB is highly scalable and designed from the start to be distributed and fast, trading speed for eventual consistency. Palia’s external traffic is routed through a geo-load balanced domain name system (DNS) address to a Network Load Balancer (NLB).\n\nReleasing Palia\n\nDuring Palia’s development, its cloud infrastructure was built entirely in a single datacenter: US West (Oregon). Singularity 6 knew that the studio would eventually need to release Palia in other Regions to reduce latency and improve the player experience. Load testing their system was also necessary to ensure a smooth rollout. Still, there was fear that there were not enough players in alpha tests to accurately simulate launch numbers.\n\nThe team used this opportunity to clone part of their production cloud infrastructure to Frankfurt. As the launch window approached, Palia released in the US first, while leveraging Frankfurt as their load and stress testing cluster, then ran a ScyllaDB copy to evaluate the latency of their queries across Regions on different continents. This “dark multiregional rollout” at the start greatly reduced risks when the game began operating in a multi-regional setting later as the S6 team could gather information on real player behavior.\n\nLoad testing\n\nBefore Palia had any players, Singularity 6 simulated them by writing load tests against their microservices using Locust. Their major focus was stress testing critical backend components, particularly ones that rely on other services to function. To generate sufficient load, S6 wrote a Locust test, ran it from within the Amazon EKS cluster, and then scaled it rapidly and effectively while gathering data that showed how the test systems responded. Using this method, the team identified inefficient code paths, balanced resource requests and limits, and tweaked auto scaling metrics.\n\nChaos testing with Litmus\n\nAfter Singularity 6 saw how their services responded to large volumes of requests, the team decided to inject some chaos into their tests. Their goal was to conduct experiments and observe how the rest of the system responded – especially for critical systems where an outage might cause a cascading failure. Using Litmus, S6 injected latency, created network isolation, and caused outages for specific services. Along the way, S6 constantly asked themselves, “Can we still play Palia?” Chaos testing helped build confidence because the team learned that once players were in-game, many types of chaos had little to no effect on them.\n\nRelease\n\nAhead of launch, Palia’s developers added and tested infrastructure to ensure they could match their player’s demands. Even with all their prep work, S6 encountered rough edges amid successes during their launch.\n\nIssue: Poor VPC planning\n\nWhen Singularity 6 started using Amazon EKS, the team already had a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) module written in Terraform. The module was not perfect, but S6 decided it was good enough to move forward without major changes. However, the team realized that this was the wrong decision within hours of launching Palia when an alert on pending pods revealed that the game had run out of IP addresses in its VPC’s subnets. S6 knew they could add additional subnets to the VPC, but didn’t notice any lines of code that might eventually cause issues in the EKS Terraform module.\n\nThe issue was they were concatenating all their private subnet IDs and public subnet IDs to the EKS cluster’s subnet IDs. When the team added new subnets to the VPC, they were also expanding the EKS cluster control plane onto these subnets. This caused issues when the cluster needed to upgrade or when a managed node group needed to roll its instances.\n\nIn summary, an initial lack of VPC planning led to a proliferation of many unique managed node groups in Singularity 6’s environment. This made it harder to make changes to the EKS cluster as the node groups changed. Below, Singularity 6 discusses how using Karpenter helped reduce their usage of managed node groups, which helped to solve this issue.\n\nSuccess: Templated resource requests and limits\n\nDuring the early ramp up, the team encountered an incident where a component of their Linkerd stack was impacted from running out of memory (OOM). Despite having multiple replicas of this component, they saw other side effects of the OOMKill pod shutdowns, which meant they needed to act quickly. Within a few minutes, the team identified the component being killed and they were able to patch the resource requests to higher limits.\n\nLuckily, S6 had accounted for this issue by adding templating in their Helm and Kustomize to account for setting resource requests and limits. An extra few hours of development work proved instrumental for patching the system while it was scaling and allowing for a smooth experience for their players.\n\nPost release: Adding new Regions\n\nAfter Palia’s release in US West (Oregon), the team finished their infrastructure in Frankfurt and started work to expand further in Tokyo. This was in preparation for Palia’s Nintendo Switch launch, which would bring in substantial new players from Asia. The team knew that providing game servers and services closer to their players would be instrumental to the game’s success, so getting Asia Pacific (Tokyo) online was a natural next step.\n\nIssue: Lack of instance diversity\n\nPalia’s backend, particularly the game servers, requires either a “many nodes with fewer vCPUs” or “fewer nodes with more vCPU” approach. In the Asia Pacific (Tokyo) Region, the team found that their preferred instance types had limited availability than either Oregon or Frankfurt. To solve for this, they decided to explore the use of Karpenter.\n\nSuccess: Using Kustomize for DRY configuration\n\nAdding new Regions revealed an obvious issue in their Gitops-style setup of ArgoCD. Namely, keeping their config (microservice version numbers, chart versions, resource requests and limits) in sync across multiple clusters.\n\nTo solve this, the team turned to Kustomize to further “customize” their DRY configurations and centralize changes such as bumping version numbers. Kustomize allowed S6 to define a single file that contained the version of both the game server and microservices. ArgoCD has excelled at noticing git repo changes and deploying updates to all regions.\n\nUsing Karpenter\n\nAt the end of October 2023, Karpenter moved to a beta readiness. At the time, Singularity 6 was using the cluster-autoscaler and formed several hypotheses that using Karpenter to manage their EKS instances closer to the control plane would provide several benefits, including:\n\nIt removed almost all of the managed node groups by reducing the burden of updating them as the cluster changed.\n\nIt granted the ability to quickly test additional instance configurations such as family, size, and architecture.\n\nIt allowed flexibility to easily adapt to Regions that lack a particular instance type.\n\nIt provided a more nuanced view of the cluster to start instances just-in-time and reduce their idle CPU.\n\nSuccess: Flexibility, experimentation, and idle costs\n\nInitially, Singularity 6 hypothesized that using Karpenter would give them flexibility across instance types, sizes, and even CPU architecture. For example, the team thought it would be straightforward to experiment running Palia on Graviton instances (with ARM processors) without any Terraform changes to managed node groups. Karpenter also streamlined issues with instance constraints in a Region like Tokyo. Finally, by configuring Karpenter to use varied instance sizes and families, S6 was able to run a cluster without any of the overhead of multiple Terraform-defined managed node groups.\n\nUsing Karpenter with its NodePool resource resulted in a reduction of idle game servers in their clusters. By configuring a more diverse set of instances, Singularity 6 was able to decrease idle cost by 75%.\n\nSuccess: Karpenter accelerates Kubernetes upgrades\n\nSwitching to Karpenter removed the need for almost all of their managed node groups. They no longer had an EKS cluster with hundreds of instances across several managed node groups. This simplification, as well as using control_plane_subnet_ids, allowed the team to more easily upgrade their EKS clusters to newer versions of Kubernetes. With fewer instances to launch and less “node group overhead” in their Terraform module, S6 was able to upgrade from K8s v1.26 to v1.28 across six EKS clusters in a few hours.\n\nConclusion\n\nFrom the player’s perspective, Palia’s PC launch went smoothly. The team performed load testing and chaos testing, which ensured the systems scaled properly. The elasticity of AWS offerings proved invaluable for this as they were able to double server capacity from 25 to 50 EC2 instances within hours across multiple Regions. Despite Singularity 6’s best efforts, they still ran into issues due to design choices made very early on.\n\nFollowing Palia’s PC release, Singularity 6’s choice to focus on improving Terraform, Kustomize, and Karpenter, allowed them to rapidly add new Regions to the game and to improve their launch on Nintendo Switch. Again, AWS availability in multiple Regions allowed the team to move from a single Region to a world-wide infrastructure in a matter of months. Moreover, by moving configuration out of Terraform and EKS and into Karpenter, they were able to adapt to resource constraints and more quickly conduct experiments.\n\nIf you are curious about more details about the Palia software architecture, head over to the Singularity 6 blog for a more in-depth overview of this topic.\n\nA special thank you to the Singularity 6 team who contributed to this architecture and blog post: Emily Price, Kyle Allan, Marc Tamsky, Matthew Walter, George Lin, Alec Nunn, Maciej Ciezki, Brian Tomlinson, and Stefano Mazzocchi.",

      "# [Palia’s black market card game is causing player arguments by Cass Marshall on 2024-07-25](https://www.polygon.com/24206154/palia-hot-pot-card-game-arguments)\nLately, there’s been a strangely hostile underbelly in super cozy life sim Palia — and I’m not talking about the hidden cartel gambling pit under the inn. Developer Singularity 6 recently added a cute and simple card game for players to enjoy, called Hot Pot. What should have been another fun diversion in the Stardew Valley-style game has instead revealed a split in the player base.\n\nPalia takes place in the cozy Kilima Village, where players can hang out with the townsfolk, farm, cook, or head out and explore the nearby bustling Bahari Bay. At night, an underground market opens up under the town store. The shopkeep, a cheerful cat-man smuggler, runs the night market from 6 p.m. to 3 a.m.\n\nHere, players can find fancy new toilets, rugs, and paintings for sale, or fish with friends. The main attraction, though, is playing the Hot Pot card game. Playing awards one coin, winning grants two, and after the games wrap up players can queue to spend their coins at a prize wheel. One spin of the wheel costs two coins, and players can win high-end cooking ingredients, adorable plushies, or cool pirate decor.\n\nMany players like to enjoy the underground market as a chill social stop. After hunting in Bahari or talking with all the villagers in Kilima, it can be nice to unwind with a little Hot Pot. The minigame isn’t particularly demanding or competitive; you go around a table of four, trading tiles, until one player has collected three sets of three matching tiles.\n\nA certain faction of players prefers to play “fast” games, though, going around the table as quickly as possible. When one player is about to win, they call out the card they need, and someone else at the table trades it in. This style of play is designed to produce as many coins as possible. If people are sharing tiles, there are no prolonged end-game standoffs, and everyone earns more coins. And when one fast table sets up, and starts filling the chat near the tables with callouts, it can lead to a fight.\n\nOver the past few days, I’ve had multiple sessions of Hot Pot be interrupted by neighboring tables breaking out into arguments. The dialogue usually boils down to “Hey, you’re cheating!” and “No, we’re working together.” Of course, having a public argument is unproductive at the best of times; having one in an online game where everyone is subjected to the back-and-forth due to proximity chat rarely goes well. Everyone in Palia is polite on the surface, during daylight. But at night, fast table debates can break out, and next thing you know the chat is filled with accusations and unsavory insults.\n\nThis argument is part of the tension of Palia; it’s an online sandbox that’s meant to sustain a community, but it’s also a very chill and low-key experience that’s often best enjoyed solo. Most of the time, this works, and the player base is very well behaved. After Hot Pot games, players will line up to spend their coins and spin the wheel, and it’s considered a faux pas to run up and join a game at a table with four players already there. But the fast table debate has broken down the usual etiquette and civility, and I’m curious to see how — or if — Singularity 6 tackles these clashing priorities between players.",
