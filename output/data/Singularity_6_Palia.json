It was 2020, and only two weeks later, the pandemic hit in full swing. We made the call to work remotely, and shared our experience in a previous blog post.\n\nSince then, we’ve announced our first game, successfully ran a number of testing phases, and grew to a company of over 135 people—all while supporting a remote work policy.\n\nBut one big question remained: What was our plan for returning to the office?\n\nWe’re happy to announce that S6 is going Remote Choice!\n\nWhat Remote Choice Means\n\nRemote Choice means we’re championing for our team to decide what’s best for them. They can choose to work remotely, return to our office, or somewhere in-between with a hybrid setup. Save for certain essential roles that require being onsite, this option will be available to our employees indefinitely. At the end of the day, we’re advocating for different needs, preferences, and circumstances of our Sixers, which is why we emphasize the word “choice.”\n\nAlong with the option to work at our LA-based office (and another we’re planning on opening in Orange County, CA), Sixers can choose to work remotely so long as they’re based in the following approved locations:\n\nUnited States\n\nCalifornia, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Michigan, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington\n\nCanada\n\nQuebec\n\nOf course, even with our employees spread across the continent, we’re still making an effort to bring Sixers together.

      "# [Palia Community Demonstrates Player Excitement and Appeal of New IP](https://www.singularity6.com/news/palia-community-excitement)\nWe're pleased to share that Palia is showing significant momentum with strong community engagement numbers, including more than 600,000 signups, that demonstrate the growing appetite for an elevated cozy sim experience among a mainstream audience.\n\nWhen revealed in June 2021, Palia was instantly embraced by both core and casual gaming audiences. Within 3 months of the title reveal, more than 600,000 players filled out a survey to playtest the game, outpacing the number of followers of Steam’s most Wishlisted games. An impressive feat for a product still in development (if we don't say so ourselves!), demonstrating a strong desire from players for the type of meaningful online game experience that we're creating.\n\nWe're intentionally building Palia alongside players, as part of the studio’s approach to game development, so that S6 can respond to the community and make improvements at every stage, and over time. Even in the earliest phases of development, the studio cultivated a highly-engaged community that has grown to more than 100,000 Discord members. Additionally, we welcomed nearly 20,000 players across several Alpha tests in 2022 and 2023. In a single Alpha window, players logged more than 167,000 hours in a month, with top players averaging about 200 hours (!!!) of playtime.\n\nOur team is developing Palia to feel welcoming, playful and friendly, which resonated strongly with early adopters looking for a sense of community, acceptance and belonging. By having strong foundations in place for its community from the outset, Singularity 6 has built trust and respect with these early adopters, who continue to help shape the game and have become evangelists for its growing community.\n\nWe look forward to sharing more information about Palia and our amazing community in the future!",

      "# [The Software Architecture of Palia](https://www.singularity6.com/news/software-architecture-of-palia)\nSingularity6’s debut game, Palia, is a free-to-play cozy online multiplayer community simulator. A place where players can play alone or with their friends to experience a beautiful and welcoming world which can be explored and personalized.\n\nSocial interaction and a persistent shared world are key features of the game. But these elements are also some of the most challenging to implement, scale, distribute geographically, and operate at minimal operational cost and negative player impact.\n\nPlayers experience the art and soul that our development team has poured into the game, but the infrastructure that makes it all possible behind the scenes is hidden from view. We are proud of what our team has accomplished with Palia, and we want to spotlight the studio’s hard work, including what players don’t experience directly. We also want to share some important lessons learned during our journey; we hope that sharing the lessons learned while developing Palia can be useful to others facing similar challenges.\n\nNow follow us behind the scenes of our Palia development journey!\n\nGame Engine\n\nBuilding an online multiplayer title from scratch benefits from a robust and proven game engine. We made the choice to build Palia using Unreal Engine. Unreal gives us powerful tools to build with out of the box, such as a strong networking and replication library to build social features, a graphics pipeline to build a beautiful world, a powerful physics engine that can simulate complex environments, and so much more. We use Unreal Engine for our game servers as well as our client, which gives players a real-time interactive environment.\n\nEach instance of the game server currently hosts up to 25 players, and we split up each server by what we call a map. These can be permanent fixtures, including our central hub Kilima Village, or even temporary available experiences, such as our Maji Market, which was only available for one month during our Luna New Year in-game event. When players travel between maps in Palia, the game client disconnects from one server and connects to a new one. We will share more details on how this works in our matchmaking service deep dive section.\n\nThis synergistic model is crucial for our team: we can develop most of the logic for Palia inside the engine and deploy to both clients and servers. This allows anyone on the team to test both the game and the game server in editor mode, which has been critical for our development velocity.\n\nSpotlight: memory leakage\n\nUnreal Engine servers are commonly used in “session-based games,” such as Fortnite: games that start and end within a certain amount of time. Memory leakage is not a big concern for session-based games because a new server is spun up for a new match and destroyed when the match ends. Any leaked memory will be cleaned before the next batch of players begin playing.\n\nPalia is a persistent shared-world game and the lifespan of our game servers is variable depending on how players move through the game world. A single game server may remain online and serve players for an entire patch cycle which could be weeks. Memory leakage which is cleaned up regularly for a session-based game can grow and compound, and small leaks might end up consuming two or even four times the amount of Random Access Memory (RAM) proportionally affecting our operational costs.\n\nTo combat this issue, we invested in solutions to help us identify memory leaks, and we spent useful time designing nudges for players to travel between maps as to increase the likelihood that a server would empty out and be shut down.\n\nUnexpectedly and fortunately, increasing geographical distribution helped with this problem: hosting servers near players not only helps with latency (because it reduces the distance that signals need to travel); but also with rotating empty servers because players tend to play at the same times, making it rare that somebody in that region is playing in the middle of the night and increasing the probability of servers to become empty, shut down, and cleaned.\n\nThis screenshot from one of our monitoring dashboards shows the memory usage of a portion of our game servers over a24h period in Feb 2024. The trend of linear memory increase is clearly visible.\n\nServices\n\nThe game client and servers talk to our services for specific actions, such as logging players into the game, loading characters, saving progress, sending chat messages to other players, making purchased outfits are stored in the player’s closet and many more.\n\nWe loosely follow a “microservice” posture, in which we prefer to host many different services specialized on one player feature.\n\nWe use HTTP as the North/South protocol (in and out of the datacenter) while we use gRPC for East/West communication (for services talking to each other inside the datacenter).\n\nWe use Rust exclusively as the programming language for our services and we try to include both integration and load testing as part of the definition of “done” for key services, including matchmaking, player presence and player state persistence which represent the largest percentage of our request load.\n\nOur unit and integration tests are also written in Rust, but we use Locust to support and execute our load tests. Locust load tests are written in Python which is simpler to program. The ability to quickly write and modify load tests was beneficial to us and sped up adoption.\n\nSpotlight: Rust for Microservices\n\nRust is a beloved programming language by many systems programmers because it provides state-of-the-art protection against common software vulnerabilities (buffer overflows and race conditions, for example) without introducing any performance penalties.\n\nRust is also a modern programming language. It is surrounded by a diverse and vibrant community of contributors and a wide range of libraries and tools. Documentation is excellent (especially onboarding tutorials) and the compiler is surely one of the most helpful and user-friendly.\n\nOf course, no programming language is perfect. Rust's posture is heavily focused on correctness, which is generally beneficial, but comes with a significant upfront cost which is visible in our development velocity. Rust makes it very hard to “cut corners” and punt hardening for later. It is a very good quality when something that was supposed to be just a prototype becomes load bearing in production by sheer pressure of business needs, but it makes it hard to move quickly and with agility around shifting requirements (which is a constant in startups and game development).\n\nThe other issue was hiring and onboarding. Rust’s relative youth as a programming language makes it somewhat difficult to hire people that have production experience with the language. Although the language is very popular, few people have used Rust in a professional team setting. Most people who have Rust experience have only used it for personal projects. With this in mind, onboarding took much longer than we expected. We factored 90 days to get engineers up to speed, but it turned out to take at least 6 months for most of the team to get comfortable and confident with the language.\n\nWe are very happy with the performance, latency, scalability, robustness and security of our Rust services. But there are moments when we wonder how much opportunity cost was spent in forcing up-front solidity of every piece of this layer.\n\nWe consider it an advantage for the studio to have managed to amortize those onboarding costs and the maintenance costs of our services is indeed very low, but those thinking of following our footsteps down the Rust path, should be willing to allocate a significant effort to education and onboarding. These costs will likely reduce over time as Rust becomes more popular in production settings, but it’s unclear what that rate will be.\n\nSeveral of our services are interesting and sophisticated enough to merit more attention: player state management and matchmaking.\n\nPlayer State Management\n\nWe consider player state all the information that a game server needs to recreate the most recent game world experienced by the player. The architecture of our game is server-authoritative which means that game servers decide the state of the world and act as referees when game clients report inconsistent data (for example, because of time delay in transmission). We took this route because Palia is a social game so a player cheating or modifying their state could have a negative impact on the experience of other players. The risk of cheating is reduced when it's our system that ultimately controls player state.\n\nThe simplest way to persist state is to wait until a player exits a game server and have the server send this information to the database. Unfortunately, this makes state changes in that server vulnerable to the server itself crashing and losing that data (which is only kept in volatile memory for performance reasons). Instead, several times a second we check for player state changes, and if there are any, that data is immediately queued and sent to the database to be persisted.\n\nSpotlight: data first vs. schema first\n\nA source of contention around player state is the modeling lifecycle: who and what decides what is valid to be stored into such a state? Traditional data-modeling techniques suggest a “schema first” approach: the structure of the data (the schema) is created ahead of time and then only data that conforms to that structure can be saved into the database.\n\nThis has the advantage that the database validates the shape of the data. The disadvantage is that one has to know ahead of time the structure of the data needed… which can be challenging to coordinate across different teams.\n\nTo increase the ease with which game engineers and technical designers could work, we decided on a different model in which the structure of the data would be decided in C++ structs directly within Unreal and then marshaled and persisted in the database as a binary blob (using the Flexbuffer format). The schema is the struct declaration itself and we use Unreal’s runtime type reflection system to export the schema to our database.\n\nThe advantage of this architectural choice is that it enabled game engineers to develop features that required state persistence without the need for constant coordination. The downside is that the data is opaque to the database, which is more expensive to keep uniform and consolidated. This has required us to invest in additional tooling around the player state management system to validate, backup, modify and correct player state when it diverges from the expected structure.\n\nDespite the additional layer of development investment needed to provide hardening on top of what the database normally provides, we believe this architecture has significantly cut down the time required to deliver new features with data persistence, such as our most recent Luna New Year event.\n\nMatchmaking\n\nIn many competitive-style online games, matchmaking is the process of selecting people for a match. For Palia, matchmaking means matching the player with the game server that we believe will give players the best gameplay experience.\n\nThere are several dimensions that we take into consideration during matching:\n\nLocation - how far away the game server is from where the player is currently playing (because closer server means lower latency and lower latency means a more fluid and immersive experience)\n\nFriends - how many of the player’s friends are currently playing on that server (because the more people they know the more meaningful their interaction will be)\n\nPopulation - how many people are playing on that server (because the more people are playing the more alive the world feels)\n\nThe matchmaking system is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing us to add more signals to the matching algorithm over time if we desire.\n\nAnother crucial feature of the matchmaking system is the ability to distinguish “join” requests and “travel” requests. A join request happens when a player starts the game and wants to join. A travel request is a match required by a player leaving one map of the game and traveling to another.\n\nThe ability to distinguish the two allows us to offer priority to “travel” requests when the system is under load and there is high contention. This is because it’s far less disruptive for players to wait a few minutes to join and then wait only a few seconds to travel between maps, than one in which the delays are spread uniformly across all matching requests.\n\nThis screenshot shows a piece of the dashboard we use to monitor queue sizes and the distribution of times it takes for a matchmaking request (join or travel) to be satisfied.\n\nSpotlight: game-aware internal queueing and autoscaling\n\nEvery empty server running in the cloud without a player on it is a waste of money. On the other hand, there might be players who want to play and all of the game servers have their allocated slots filled so they would benefit from an empty server to land in.\n\nMany online games design “login queues” or similar ways to restrict the inbound flow of players and scale up or down the number of servers to meet the demand. Originally, this was our intent as well, but we realized we would benefit from a more sophisticated matchmaking design that could distinguish between joining and traveling. We also realized that the matchmaker had all the information it needed to control the size of the game server fleet.\n\nThis is how we came up with the Admiral: a component of the matchmaking system that oversees the fleet of game servers. The Admiral understands when the current fleet of game servers is insufficient to satisfy the number of players requesting a match and is able to ask the underlying cloud system (specifically Agones) to request the creation of more game server instances. Agones, on the other hand, is responsible for shutting down game servers that have been empty for some time.\n\nThe integration of autoscaling with matchmaking and the separation of concerns between the Admiral (scaling up) and Agones (scaling down) has served us very well and has managed to provide us with shock absorption to the game when things didn’t go as planned. Several times, the elasticity of these queues between maps have saved the team from having to bring down the game entirely to fix issues during misaligned deployments or unforeseen behaviors during load spikes.\n\nThis screenshot shows the view of the game servers fleet from the Admiral. Each line is really two lines: one for the “desired size” and another for the “actual size”. This information is used to tell the cloud orchestrator to spin up more game servers for a particular map type as they are needed by players being matched to servers that don’t yet exist.\n\nData Management\n\nOur architecture of loosely coupled software components wouldn’t be very useful without data flowing between them and being persisted, validated, or aggregated.\n\nDatabases\n\nOne of the most difficult elements of creating a shared perpetual world is constructing the ability for players to influence it (and one another) in a context that feels immediate and consistent. A key factor to provide a positive player experience is the choice of the database architecture.\n\nWe decided to use ScyllaDB as our main data persistence layer. ScyllaDB is a C++ rewrite of Apache Cassandra (originally created at Facebook and, in turn, heavily influenced by Google BigTable and Amazon DynamoDB), a distributed column store.\n\nThe biggest advantage of ScyllaDB for us has been its elastic scalability and its cloud native “design for failure” posture that aligned very well with ours. One significant advantage of ScyllaDB for us is the ability to attach replication strategy to a table but eventual consistency levels to a query. This gives us a lot of flexibility because in some cases we need consistency more than we need speed and we can tune that directly at the query level. This is not possible with traditional relational databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL.\n\nThis functionality is crucial, for example, when dealing with a persistent player state: we want the data to be replicated on multiple computers before we return a response to the game server. This means that both the game server and multiple database nodes have to die (at the very same time!) for that player state update to get lost. As far as we can tell, this has never happened.\n\nWe also use PostgreSQL (hosted for us by AWS) for the catalog of our outfits available for purchase in the game. We used a relational database here because we felt it was better suited for this particular job.\n\nAsynchronous Messaging\n\nAnother important part of the data management layer is the ability of software components to message one another asynchronously.\n\nWe have two of such busses:\n\nThe first for aggregates and collects telemetry for player behavior (which uses Apache Kafka, more on this later) and feeds our analytics and machine learning pipelines.\n\nAnother coordinates software components (for example, the control plane between the fleet auto-scaler and the game servers). This uses EMQX as the broker and MQTT as the protocol.\n\nWhy two? Mostly because they serve different purposes, have different strengths and weaknesses, and are managed by different teams focusing on separate outcomes. There might be value in consolidating things further in the future, but for now this separation is serving us well.\n\nSpotlight: MQTT and Apache ActiveMQ v5 (aka Artemis)\n\nThe use of MQTT as the message bus protocol for our game servers control planes was decided precisely to isolate us from lock-in of a particular broker implementation. In retrospect, this was a weak choice: MQTT is an IoT protocol and we were attracted by the fact that it was designed for devices with small power and low bandwidth. We wanted a solution that would be easy and cheap for the game servers to interact with and didn’t consume a lot of their resources.\n\nUnfortunately, many MQTT brokers simply implemented that protocol on top of their existing native systems. We picked Apache ActiveMQ v5 (aka Artemis) because it was established and it supported v5 of the MQTT protocol (which offered features we needed) but was written and designed before clouds existed and turned out to be incompatible with our preferred “loosely coupled components expected to fail” architectural posture.\n\nArtemis has been the source of much apprehension and tribulation. We ended up having to patch the software to fit our needs. We operated with a forked version in production just to keep it from falling over regularly (the MQTT layer and cross-regional federation layers did not work well together).\n\nWe have since migrated to EMQX which is a more modern MQTT broker, designed from the ground-up with MQTT in mind and we have not looked back.\n\nThe lesson learned here is that even established and battle-tested software might still end up performing poorly when utilized in a different context and with different operational constraints than was originally intended.\n\nData Pipelines\n\nAnother important principle of our software architecture is that we want to be able to observe and monitor how the system is behaving so that we can act on it effectively when behavior deviates from the norm.\n\nWe treat data differently based on whether the decision making that it supports is latency sensitive or not. In fact, we use completely different systems for low-latency decision support (seconds to minutes) vs. high-latency (days or weeks).\n\nSpotlight: player behavior vs. system behavior\n\nIn the past, we separated data based on whether it was about player behavior or software behavior. But we quickly realized that distinction was not very helpful in practice.\n\nFor example, a purchasing event from a player is technically a player behavior and insights gathered from them influence strategic decision making with high-latency (days or weeks). But such a high-latency reaction would be detrimental to both our players and our revenue if we didn’t get notified immediately if the frequency of purchases dropped outside of the normal range of operation.\n\nIt is generally true that data generated from the behavior of players influences decision making in aggregate and with high latency while events generated by the behavior of software systems influences decisions and actions that require quick reaction times. But our ability to route data based on decision making latency needs and not on the semantics of origin has made it easier to reason about data routing decisions, especially when the two pipelines are handled by different teams with different skills, strengths, and goals.\n\nObservability\n\nWe picked Prometheus as the time-series database powering the low-latency data pipeline and alerting. The key advantage here is the “pull” model in which it is Prometheus to “scrape” data from our software components, which makes it a lot simpler to maintain.\n\nWe also use Grafana as our visual dashboarding system querying the data stored in Prometheus along with Loki and Tempo to deal textual logs and tracing the flow of execution across several of our software components.\n\nLastly, we use Sloth to automate the generation of SLOs.\n\nAnalytics\n\nThe high-latency data pipeline revolves around Apache Kafka (managed for us by Confluent) which captures and routes the data as well as Apache Spark (managed for us by Databricks), which we use to aggregate and analyze the data.\n\nWe use Apache Airflow (managed for us by Astronomer) for monitoring and scheduling long-running workflows for data aggregation and analysis. Lastly, we use Tableau to power the visualization of the insights that result from our data analysis.\n\nCloud Infrastructure\n\nAnother development challenge is the “free-to-play” nature of our distribution strategy. This approach made it difficult to predict the amount of players that would play the game, especially around key events, such as platform launches, major updates, and in-game events.\n\nWe decided to be “cloud native” from the start because “elasticity” in supply of computation and bandwidth is a key advantage that cloud providers have over acquiring and maintaining our own server infrastructure; especially for gaming startups (for which capital is constrained) and when deploying across multiple geographical regions.\n\nCloud native for us didn’t simply mean: “run our programs on somebody else’s computer.” Cloud native for us meant designing a software architecture composed of small pieces that are loosely coupled and always expected to fail.\n\nWe call this “designing for failure.” Of course, we never want our systems to fail. However, we believe that resiliency in software systems comes less from preventing failure, and more from providing mitigations to such risks and the ability to restore service as quickly and automatically as possible. We want to design to reduce failure but we always expect it to happen, so when it does happen, our systems would not be surprised by it.\n\nKey components of this strategy were using Kubernetes as our orchestration system, Linkerd as our service mesh, Traefik as our load balancer and Agones to manage our fleet of game servers. We also rely heavily on the “infrastructure as code” principle, using Kustomize to help us keep our configurations DRY and ArgoCD to power continuous deployments.\n\nKubecost helps us measure costs, and we recently swapped from cluster-autoscaler to Karpenter to optimize cluster elasticity and to help pick the best server instances. This change allowed us to save a non-trivial percentage of our cloud costs by automating the selection of instance types to use to run our workloads.\n\nFor provisioning infrastructure we rely on Terraform and Spacelift. We rely on Vault to store secrets without our cloud environments. We also conduct chaos testing using Litmus.\n\nAnd we rely on a few different services for authentication and authorization systems, including FusionAuth for account management, Zendesk for customer support management, Stripe for payment processing, and Vivox for our in-game chat system.\n\nOur only cloud provider is Amazon Web Services which provides us computers, storage, and bandwidth across multiple regions: United States, Germany, and Japan. We also rely on Cloudflare for geo-aware DNS and load balancing as well as DDoS protection.\n\nSpotlight: Nomad vs. Kubernetes\n\nWe had originally chosen Nomad as our orchestration solution, mostly because it was perceived to be conceptually simpler and it was much more compatible with Windows workloads (which we thought we might need for testing purposes).\n\nUnfortunately, Nomad had one very significant problem: the momentum of the development community around it was significantly smaller than around Kubernetes. This had two significant issues for us: a) we had to develop in-house solutions that the community around Kubernetes had already implemented; and b) it was harder to engage the team with a technology that many considered an evolutionary dead-end.\n\nWe made the difficult call to switch our cloud orchestration system by using the argument that our development velocity would significantly improve and our operational risks would be reduced. This turned out to be very much the case and it’s a decision we would happily make again.\n\nBuild Systems\n\nThere are two primary concepts used in the building of Palia and its supporting services: the build platform and the build system. Historically, game studios lumped these two together around the primary continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) component. We borrowed some plays from large-scale build and release systems beyond gaming: using a heavily distributed approach inspired by some of our team members’ experiences in other industries, such as banking.\n\nTo power the build system we use Jenkins, but take care to draw a distinction between the software, and the underlying infrastructure upon which it runs and integrates. While related, these things are best served by intentional, separate configuration management and Infrastructure as Code practices which can quickly become unwieldy and complex if attempting to do so under a monolithic design. The result is a hybrid cloud approach to the build system. We use both an on-prem data center and Amazon Web Services, and one side of the architecture can be maintained without potentially negatively impacting the other.\n\nWe also took the time to redesign the initial version of the build system (Jenkins pipelines) around Unreal Engine’s native tooling, namely, BuildGraph. Doing so required a lot of work up-front as the old method was cobbled together between Jenkins Pipelines and Python scripts, but the declarative nature of BuildGraph tooling has allowed us to increase correctness, reduce build system maintenance, and increase flexibility such that we can build almost every target platform with minimal specific changes for each. A key component of this success was integrating with AutoSDK and creating a “standard library” of sorts in Jenkins to glue it all together.\n\nIn our latest version of the build platform we are able to mostly dynamically scale the number of executors based on demand. The build system can then simply act as a “glue layer” to distribute requested tasks among the available executors as parallel pipeline runs. Further, we’ve incorporated designing for Self-Service by other teams, such that they can “pick and choose” which artifacts they want built via a single interface. We call this the “Prime Pipeline,” which presents a series of configurable parameters and then schedules the running of “Sub-Pipelines” to do the work, passing those parameters as appropriate. This means that via the same Prime Pipeline interface, one Engineer could choose to build only one Platform Client from the library of Clients available, and one Server, getting only those two artifacts; or they could select everything and end up with every Client and Server we currently offer as targets.\n\nSpotlight: Capacity Management in a Hybrid Cloud World\n\nA trade-off we make for this level of granularity and distribution is the initial difficulty in managing capacity. We use several build executors of different types and had to really break-down our pipelines and how each stage would be distributed to the executors both on-prem and in AWS. Then we had to measure a single run of each pipeline to get more accurate numbers to use for calculating instance sizes, costs, expected load, and timings for stage and whole pipeline execution. This cost us a lot of time up-front, and while we are glad we did it, it is yet another piece of operational overhead which must be monitored, reviewed, and adjusted in order to remain reasonably accurate. Changing something as simple as the Node Label of a particular pipeline Stage can have serious impacts to all of the metrics we measure, most notably, build times. Unfortunately, there aren't a whole lot of “drop-in” or “off-the-shelf” solutions for these types of systems, so we have had to track these things manually, and then automate as we go to attempt to reduce the operational burden.\n\nFurthermore, managing two different sets of infrastructure is not for the faint of heart, or those unfamiliar with Hybrid Cloud management. While the patterns may be very similar, the implementation proved to be a lot more work than we anticipated.\n\nFor example, AWS and other cloud service providers make APIs available to interact on a very granular level with their exposed components. On the other end of the spectrum, even the most mature on-prem infrastructure providers rely on their own custom tooling for managing hardware components. This is why projects such as Ansible are in such heavy use in the IT industry, and S6 is no exception here as we prioritize the use of open source tools where possible to ease cognitive load and keep costs low.\n\nThe challenge that made this most difficult was the disparity in experience using this approach on our team members’ time. Some of us come from more of a Platforming background, others from a Tooling background, and still others from primarily a Jenkins Pipeline writing background. This is great for general cross-functionality within the team, but requires careful planning to execute well even among the highest-performing teams.\n\nVersion Control\n\nWe use two different version control systems to manage the development lifecycle of our code: Perforce for the game code, and git (hosted in Bitbucket) for everything else.\n\nUsing different version control systems is clearly suboptimal and not a decision we took lightly: git is generally preferred by backend engineers and is far better supported by modern development environments.\n\nUnfortunately, Perforce is very well integrated in Unreal Engine because that’s what Epic Games uses (the makers of Unreal Engine). Also, git isn’t really designed to work with very large binary files, and a lot of our in-game assets and original sources are giant binary files. Perforce works well in these situations.\n\nEarly on, we tried using git-lfs (large file storage), which is supposed to help with this problem but we gave up when we realized how much effort it would be to retrofit all of the Epic development tools (UnrealGameSync, for example) to work with git.\n\nWe sincerely wish we had a single consolidated version control system and code review workflow, but it is not a trivial exercise.\n\nSpotlight: Consolidated Repos\n\nOne of the issues we faced with git was that it was too easy and convenient to create new repositories, causing a proliferation of them. The biggest issue we faced was the inability to make changes that cross-cut different services at once. This created a lot of production overhead and reduced our ability to consolidate the behavior of services.\n\nWe considered switching to a full “monorepo” but many of us were unfamiliar with it and feared additional complexity and overhead that we had no additional development capacity to support.\n\nThe compromise we reached was a handful of consolidated repos in which many individual git repositories were merged into a single repository and then archived. All the microservices ended up in this single repository, but they could be developed, built, tested and deployed in isolation. This made it much easier to modify code across services (such as version dependencies) as well as simplifying the creation of libraries. This approach facilitated an incremental externalization of common functionality into modules that could be more easily reused across services, reducing copy/paste code duplication and reducing our maintenance costs.\n\nSaaS-y Open Source\n\nOne common theme you might have noticed in our architecture is that we prefer to depend on software that is open source and that we could host ourselves if we wanted/needed to. We also prefer to rely on a SaaS vendor that provides and manages this software for us instead of running it ourselves.\n\nThis offers us several advantages:\n\nWe are not locked into a particular cloud or vendor provider (as we could run the system ourselves if we needed to).\n\nWe can provision systems more quickly (our people don’t need to learn the intricacies of configuring them).\n\nLeverage vendor expertise to fix issues and/or edge cases when we encounter them.\n\nKeeps the vendor prices under control under our threat of shutting down our vendor contract and hosting the system ourselves.\n\nWe deviated from this posture only rarely and when there was no open source alternative that made sense for our business needs. However, we do believe this paradigm worked well for us and provides a way to fund and support further development of these open source projects. This, in turn, lowers our future risks by helping make the development of these open projects more sustainable (as these hosting vendors often employ contributors to the open source projects and continue to fund their contributions for mutually symbiotic benefit).\n\nConclusions\n\nIt’s rare to get access to the source code that makes up video games, so it’s rare to have the opportunity to learn directly from it. Even rarer is a view into the decisions and tradeoffs, the lessons learned, the paths not taken and those taken but with later regret.\n\nWe hope that this deep-dive on the challenges and successes of creating Palia’s software architecture provides some insight and inspiration for others facing similar challenges.\n\nIf you have any questions about Palia’s software architecture and development, or simply if you want to start a conversation feel free to reach out to us at hello@singularity6.com.\n\nSpecial Thanks\n\nThe list of people that contributed to this architecture is very long (see the Palia credits for the full list) and we wouldn’t do it justice to replicate it here.

So they want the company to put more effort into the cash shop than the game. Welcome to the realities of the F2P model.\n\nThese same criticisms were made of Fortnite when it launched.  It's gone on to do just fine, and had continued to have a cash shop of cosmetics that don't affect gameplay.  As long as it's strictly cosmetic, I really don't see a problem.  100% of the game (incomplete as it might be) can be experienced with paying a dime.\n\n### Comment ID jwg9fhv with +14 score by [(Pling7, Reddit, 2023-08-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwg9fhv/) (in reply to ID jwg4lqm):\nFortnite was basically fully actualized as a product though. The problem with Palia lies with priorities. Many systems are unrealized and unpolished compared to other games like it (from much smaller studios) yet the cash shop is already up an functioning. It also begs the question, what are their motivations for doing things the way they do them? Is making the game online in itself done just to sell more cosmetics? Are they going to forgo a more interactive pet system in lieu of one where they can sell cosmetic only pets?  \n\n \\- In a game with such few systems cosmetics play a much larger role in motivating a player. The fact that it's open beta only makes the emphasis on MTX items that much more glaring of a problem (because there's basically nothing to work for at some point).\n\n#### Comment ID jwgi277 with +5 score by [(hyrle, Reddit, 2023-08-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwgi277/) (in reply to ID jwg9fhv):\nWhen Fortnite was in beta, it wasn't a finalized product, though.  It had far fewer features than it has now.  It didn't have several of the systems it has now.  It had far fewer game modes.  In fact, it spent years in beta.\n\nI get the concerns over lack of content in Palia.  I even get concerns about cosmetics costing more than people want to pay (let's face it... any price over $0 is going to be more than some people want to pay.)  But it must be remembered this is a recently-opened live service game that's in beta and shouldn't be critiqued as if it's a complete game.  Even the fully-launched Fortnite continues to evolve, and I'm certain Palia will as long as it is profitable enough to keep it going.    And if it's not profitable, then like hundreds of live service games before it, then it'll close shop as so many F2P games have done before.\n\nIt's understandable that some might not like the direction of that evolution - and it's fair to critique that - but I'm just saying the expectations for a beta should be far lower.\n\n### Comment ID jwgxycg with +2 score by [(MeVe90, Reddit, 2023-08-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwgxycg/) (in reply to ID jwg4lqm):\nI'm surprised they didn't launch a battle pass yet\n\n## Comment ID jwik56a with +5 score by [(Eggsysmistress, Reddit, 2023-08-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwik56a/) (in reply to ID 15ss9gg):\ni thought they were an indie studio at first and was like “aww what a cute game. i’m sure they’ll work hard to make it better”. \n\npfft.\n\n## Comment ID jwjkx17 with +3 score by [(magvadis, Reddit, 2023-08-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwjkx17/) (in reply to ID 15ss9gg):\nIndie has to due with being owned by a major game company. \n\nOne 50 million dollar game does not make you major...at all.\n\n### Comment ID jwjlwc7 with +2 score by [(PsyTripper, Reddit, 2023-08-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwjlwc7/) (in reply to ID jwjkx17):\nThanks for clearing that up.

They did it with free realms when it was still around, they can also make it where anything beyond bare bones minimum requires a subscription to have or even use.\n\nI don’t have an issue with monetizing a game i have an issue with making a game a cash cow by prioritizing monetizing over quality and development\n\n### Comment ID lc00mlg with +2 score by [(ChemicalMonkey3, Reddit, 2024-07-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lc00mlg/) (in reply to ID lb823yk):\nP2W doesn't mean you pay to actually win like it did in the past. It basically means pay to not be hindered at every step, otherwise you fall behind everyone else. Monetizing bag slots, adding inventory weight and monetizing that, nerfing xp gains and implementing boosts, storage space, stricter decoration limits etc, etc, etc, you get the picture. Something similar to Black Desert Online would be the route they take. While BDO isn't exactly P2W in the old sense, you definitely have to pay to not get completely and utterly shafted in everything you do.\n\n### Comment ID lbc2pfl with +1 score by [(nemamene, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lbc2pfl/) (in reply to ID lb823yk):\nan example would be tools that are even better than exquisite. mine big pal in 2 hits, etc.\n\n#### Comment ID lbjnovc with +1 score by [(god_plz_no, Reddit, 2024-07-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lbjnovc/) (in reply to ID lbc2pfl):\nSell boosts in bulk, like fisherman tonics, dowsing rods, compasses etc. for faster farming or even blatant XP boosters like Ubisoft)\n\n## Comment ID lb7q8ec with +131 score by [(FawkTheElf, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb7q8ec/) (in reply to ID 1dt7ujt):\nOh the company that killed h1z1, cooooooooooooool. \n\nHere is hoping things go well.\n\n### Comment ID lb84smp with +45 score by [(ScurvyDanny, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb84smp/) (in reply to ID lb7q8ec):\nLotRO is going strong still, and they have a system where you can earn premium content for free, so I'm not that worried.\n\n#### Comment ID lb8wla8 with +26 score by [(Iroh_the_Dragon, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb8wla8/) (in reply to ID lb84smp):\nI believe that feature has been around since looooong before the game was acquired by Daybreak. Taking away that feature would’ve lost them a ton of players as deeds(the activity that earns the store currency) are a very popular thing for many veteran players to work on once they’ve completed the current end game raids and dungeons. Essentially, the MMO saying “the true end game is fashion” is very much based in reality for LOTRO. The feature has basically been grandfathered in throughout the various acquisitions LOTRO has gone through over the years. (source: I’ve been playing LOTRO off and on for over a decade)\n\nPalia, however, is still very new and, as a result, very malleable. I’m trying to remain optimistic, but I won’t be surprised if this acquisition means big changes for Palia and its monetization. Ultimately, though, if it means the game will make it to 1.0 while retaining its heart and soul, I’ll be ecstatic. The S6 devs have created a really solid foundation and I’d love to see what else they have planned.\n\n#### Comment ID lb87gk4 with +14 score by [(AmberRosalie_, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb87gk4/) (in reply to ID lb84smp):\nThey only publish LoTRO though so I’m not sure how much actual involvement they have.

So I had not to spend anything there.\n\nAnd the fee to purchase the Add-ons was really low compared to the original price in points.\n\nIf i remember it correctly, they had giveaway free, 26 Quest packs from different zones, and offer each expansion pack from Moria to Mordor for each 100 points only, while the mordor pack had cost 2500 points.\n\nSure, without that event it had taken more time to get it free, but could still be possible.

I have seen some games under the Daybreak banner flourish and others fail.\n\nIn the official statement released it does say that S6 and the game development will still stay under the current leadership.  This  lends hope that maybe Palia will have some luck similar to LotRO where Daybreak is more of a \"publisher\" than a developer.  \n\nWill we see more monetization?  Of course.  A game has to have a revenue stream somehow to continue support and development.  This would have been coming regardless of the Daybreak acquisition or not.  And if they didn't, then our favorite world would eventually die out.\n\nAll we can do at this point is just wait and see.  Me personally, I'll continue to play just how I've been playing and watch what changes.  If it starts to change for the better, GREAT!  If it starts to go downhill, then I'll just start looking for a new home.\n\n## Comment ID lb9zaxp with +9 score by [(mistar_z, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb9zaxp/) (in reply to ID 1dt7ujt):\nI'm concerned for the employees. I knew that when they did all those big layoffs earlier this year it meant that they're probably planning for a sale or acquisition, to look better on paper . This sadly isn't great news for the remaining employees as acquisitions normally means more layoffs on the horizon as the leadership restructures the company to their new bottom line.\n\n\nBut on the positive side.

There’s always more layoffs on the horizon. They change the company culture. Just experienced an acquisition myself and so many people are quitting bc after layoffs we’re a skeleton crew and they turned the culture so profit driven.\n\nIf anyone thinks the ethics of Palia are going to stay the same- don’t hold your breath. I wouldn’t be surprised if they stayed pushing ads for in game purchases and went in a different direction with art eventually. \n\nWe can’t forget that S6 is a for-profit company. And this acquisition is going to open peoples eyes to that. It’s no shade on S6.

If they were making plenty off of people buying the clothing and just wanting to support the company, there wouldn’t have been layoffs. It sucks, but there’s a reason MMOs don’t follow this monetization model, and it’s not JUST corporate greed.

Daybreak, formerly known as Sony Online Entertainment, launched EverQuest in 1999 and the game is still going.

I'd love to have more things i CAN buy but not things i NEED to buy in order for the game to be fun.\n\nIn terms of game longevity i think this is a good move, there are many old games from Daybreak that are still going (kinda) strong for many years.\n\nEDIT: Everquest has recently became free to play, after 25 years lmao\n\n### Comment ID lb8wv8b with +3 score by [(namakost, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb8wv8b/) (in reply to ID lb8sw64):\nI would understand if they took it blindly with whatever daybreak attached to it, but the devs are so passionate that I can't imagine that they wouldn't put some ground rules for monetization since a big part of palias marketing revolves around free content and accessibility for everyone.\n\n### Comment ID lb9dmm6 with +3 score by [(enbyshaymin, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb9dmm6/) (in reply to ID lb8sw64):\n*Formerly known as Sony Online Entertainment and Verant Interactive, co-developers of EverQuest since 1999.\n\nDaybreak's history is weird af. First, they were part of SISA with which they started developement of EverQuest. Then SOE was made and SISA was renamed into 989 Studios. THEN they went into making PS games, while a branch spun off and formed RedEye Interactive which was then renamed as Verant Interactive.\n\nThen they released EverQuest. Later they were controlled by Sony Pictures which iirc was like, it's grandparent company (Sony Pictures owned SOE which owned Verant), and later in 2015 SOE was sold off to Columbus Nova and Verant changed it's name into Daybreak.\n\nWhich they claim no, they didn't, they were bought by Inception Acquisitions... which was related to Columbus Nova. Which was involved with the Renova Group. Which was... in trouble, to say the least, during 2016. Oh, those russians!\n\nThen in 2018 a mobile game company \"strategically\" invested in Daybreak to port games to mobile... and three rounds of layoffs occurred. Things went awry, it got separated into three teams and then in 2020 they were bought by Enad Global 7. \n\nThey also took over MTG Online in 2022, and it seems they had few layoffs since, with a recent one being of \"less than 15 employees\" from their three branches.\n\nAll that said, S6 may be lucky and have no issues now that Daybreak's situation has changed.\n\n### Comment ID lb9kexf with +4 score by [(h39000, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb9kexf/) (in reply to ID lb8sw64):\nI never had issues w the WoW sub because the game *worked*.

My old long time gamer husband tells me this isnt a bad thing at all. I trust his judgement on this because all I am seeing is folks getting their underwear twisted over how the company choose to fund the work on the game. Frankly we are lucky to have had a free game which hasnt had anything but skins behind a paywall. So how about a bit of positivity and hope instead? S6 have as far as I can tell in the 4 months of playing, given players practically everything they could do within the game mechanics as it stands.  Wanted plushies? you got them.. wanted trees? got them, wanted flow trees on your plot? you got them! Wanted hotpot back? we got it! Bigger houses? got that too....! S6 have listened and delivered where they can. So enough whining and moaning about their partnership with an established game provider, they can rehire, and hopefully we will see the fruits of this soon! If you dont want to buy into stuff then dont but if you are going to moan about a FREE to play game that is still currently in dev mode then you really need to find something else to do with your life.   \nPersonally I think this is rather exciting for S6, it shows confidence from the industry that Palia is viable for the future.\n\n### Comment ID lbbgeoy with +6 score by [(marchviolet, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lbbgeoy/) (in reply to ID lbasarc):\nMy own longtime gamer husband also had a relatively positive reaction to this news when I shared it with him.

Is it going to end up in maintenance mode soon,or will the money earned from the sale be put into development? Will Devs from other projects come help with Palia, or the other way round? Will it be micromanaged by a boss, will it get new management, will they continue as was?

They are pretty much the exact opposite of what S6 was about when it comes to monetization. The fact S6 was even open to an acquisition in the first place isn't a good sign but if you couple that with them actually going through with it with such a publisher speaks volumes. This one line from the official acquisition statement says it all.\n\n\"It is incredibly exciting to find like-minded partners who share in our commitment to investing in our products and players for the long-term\"\n\nLet's focus on this a little, \"products\" and \"players\". First off, S6 would never refer to the game as a \"product\", so right from the start you know this section wasn't written by them. Secondly, any time a company mentions 2 things under the same context you should always read them separately like this.\n\n\"It is incredibly exciting to find like-minded partners who share in our commitment to investing in our products\"\n\n\"It is incredibly exciting to find like-minded partners who share in our commitment to investing in our players for the long-term\"\n\nRead that last one about players and what does it sound like to you? I'll spell it out for you just in case...we are the product, not the game. They have invested in a new player base that is outside there normal target audience. Whether this is good or bad will remain to be seen but they have an expectation of a return on that investment and with a game like Palia that could be tricky. It costs more to create something new then it does to place artificial limitations on us and people are far more likely to spend money on a better experience then on a prettier one. So like I originally said, hope for the best but prepare for the worst because the odds are not in our favor here by a long shot and it really pains me because I love this game.\n\nEDIT: Somehow the other half of my comment got cut when I posted lol. So here is my optimistic side.\n\nThis DOES have a bright side to it. Investment from a bigger company can be a really good thing. Most of the games under Daydreams publishing are actually good games if you ignore the monetization factor. The world building and lore behind most of them are top notch, but the story writing tends to be a little lack luster. S6 however has great writing and a LOT of lore and world elements to build upon so with Daydreams backing Palia has a lot going for it in a good way.\n\n## Comment ID lb83d6r with +9 score by [(haffasandwitch, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb83d6r/) (in reply to ID 1dt7ujt):\n![gif](giphy|7doqMMIYTH1Zkq9mpY|downsized)\n\n## Comment ID lbbmyo0 with +5 score by [(TwistedReads, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lbbmyo0/) (in reply to ID 1dt7ujt):\nwell. good run everyone see you in the next game!\n\n## Comment ID lbdyjsa with +5 score by [(evaperated, Reddit, 2024-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lbdyjsa/) (in reply to ID 1dt7ujt):\nHonestly I’m a huge fan of the battle pass model, and would welcome something like that in Palia.

They either complain that a one time fee for a game is ‘ridiculously overpriced’ or they complain a completely free to play game DARES to have a cash shop feature.\n\nI’ve bought outfits I like in Palia, and bought the landscapes and a couple pets.

For a life Sim it lacks basic features, the decorating is nice but you can hardly interact with anything. Especially in town. Benches you can't sit in at all, a tavern where you can't sit eat, drink, nothing. \n\nAnd for an mmo it's like 20 people in a town map, and your alone in your home instance. They could have done a neighborhood like xiv so you can at least see some other houses without having to ask to be invited. \n\nThere is a clothing shop but it only sells clothes for premium currency, all \"basic\" clothes are just unlocked from the start. The shop is basically purely cosmetic as well since you just buy it from the store, from anywhere. \n\nThe character creator is pretty barebones as well, for a fully social game with no other real content besides rp. Like two body types, 4 faces, and maybe 20 hairstyles. This should have had City of Heroes level of customization or more.\n\n### Comment ID ky83aom with +25 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-04-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1bwiuin/cozy_mmo_palia_developer_singularity_6_has/ky83aom/) (in reply to ID ky6tkrn):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID ky9fot3 with +17 score by [(LaurenMille, Reddit, 2024-04-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1bwiuin/cozy_mmo_palia_developer_singularity_6_has/ky9fot3/) (in reply to ID ky83aom):\nAre they still instantly banning anyone that offers constructive criticism? \n\nI was part of the exodus of players that happened when they went on their banning spree with anyone that wouldn't parrot exactly what they said.\n\n#### Comment ID kyauig7 with +10 score by [(SyleSpawn, Reddit, 2024-04-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1bwiuin/cozy_mmo_palia_developer_singularity_6_has/kyauig7/) (in reply to ID ky83aom):\nI've *played* the game since Alpha (I think 3 years ago), the core problem is that what was available in Alpha was *exactly* what was delivered in Beta 2 years later.

It was basicaly Sci-Fi Warcraft, but it didn’t feel as “WoW clone” at all. The World Building was on point and it was all funny and jokes most of the time, but very serious when an important story archs happened. Just a perfect way how to tell a story imho.\n\nGameplay-wise it had everything what you wanted from an OG theme park mmorpg, but in a modern coat. Dungeons, raids, pvp bgs and arenas, ranked modes, awesome housing system, the list goes on. The best part? It released with all of that stuff. No “alpha” bullshit. Except for bugs and tuning, it just felt finished on the release day.\n\nMany people will disagree with me, but it was THE mmorpg for me. I played from start to shut-down and I wish I re-lived it again. My only real problems with the game was the simplified gearing system ( just 1 weapon per class ) and the telegraph spell system just wasn’t right in large scale battles ( most of the ground were just green and red circles and you couldn’t see anything in battlegrounds for example.)\n\n#### Comment ID lbb3stf with +25 score by [(Deadpoetic6, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbb3stf/) (in reply to ID lbb1yz9):\nTheme,  world, music, combat, housing, artstyle\n\n#### Comment ID lbck51e with +5 score by [(aplcdr, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbck51e/) (in reply to ID lbb1yz9):\nClasses were a lot of fun, I liked race design and the housing system is probably the best that there has ever been\n\n#### Comment ID lbbmdjc with +19 score by [(Akhevan, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbbmdjc/) (in reply to ID lbb1yz9):\n> What features did it have or what was so universally enjoyed about it?\n\nThe fact that it closed down.  \n\nIt was plagued by shitty design decisions and everybody largely hated it while it was still running.\n\n#### Comment ID lbbicbf with +31 score by [(BeatDownn, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbbicbf/) (in reply to ID lbb1yz9):\nPeople just want what they can't have.

Especially something like EQ, which doesn't necessarily have the highest player count, but something like 80% of all players subscribe, which is an incredible conversion rate for any game.\n\nThey also have stuff like DCUO, LOTRO (at a time when there's a lot of LotR media coming out) and DDO (at a time when D&D is really popular).\n\nPlus, like MassivelyOP pointed out once, all Daybreak games have essentially paid off their initial development costs and are running with super small teams.

Whatever that means to you, to me it means playing as and with a group.\nPalia has virtually zero of that. We can argue there's some in hunting and cooking. But barely. Feels more like something that happened by accident rather than design. The new tree dweller for instance is a lot of fun as a group.\n\nStill on the social aspect... No actual common goals.\nNo specialization and no trading. A spouse that farms whatever all day has no proper way to help their significant other than to actually go farm with them again. Random gift limits \nSocial Friend requests that cant be cancelled and forever perpetuate your list.\nOne of the 3 souls that still plays with me can't connect since the previous patch.\n\nTickets that have zero personalization. Straight out of a script and a request to send logs. Even on trivial things.\n\nPatches. There are many game devs here. We know how it is. HOWEVER... You can't always excuse it. If you already have the framework and are reskining things, the whole setup shouldn't break. Adding quest dialogue when you already have a quest system shouldn't be a server breaking ordeal.\nIf you are struggling with seasonal content like every other game does... You need a better testing group.\nThere has yet to be a single patch that didn't devolve into overtime. Not one. Even quick hotfixes have done it sometimes.\nAlso, if you add a \"let me do this quest later\" option... How about testing to make sure it works? A game breaking issue from the new NPC I saw no mention of since it was identified.\nYet, the new cosmetics keep coming at increased prices.\nI have no issue on this topic, but on the subject of optics, you have game breaking bugs but you project an appearance of cosmetics having priority, which will inevitably turn some players away.\n\nAnd finally, on the subject of PC player retention...\nWhile we understand you're aiming for a Switch release and probably have technical limitations to consider...\nDecades now of observing mmo players should be a STRONG indication that be it the competitive, builder or gatherer player type, \"more\" is the goal.\nHaving limitations has given you an (hopefully) unintended \"game over\".\nGold limitations, renown limitations, storage limitations, building limitations, heck, even farming limitations, are only going to turn the non casual player away. If you want players online most of their free time, this is not a good approach.\n\nIn sum, I have capped my gold, crafted all the furniture, maxed storage, farming, all rep is maxed...\nIt is now a game I sometimes load once a week to do weekly medals and forget about it the rest of the week. And even this amounts to 5 minutes of \"hey, want to catch 10 bugs with me?\". \n\nAnd then we load a game that let's us play together for a common goal.\n\nTldr, please make your social game... Social.\n\n### Comment ID kca3916 with +9 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kca3916/) (in reply to ID kc8noze):\n100% this.

Open beta and early access are now really just terms for games that have been released incomplete and probably not to a good standard. If anyone who wants to can play your game you've released it. \n\nAlpha beta etc used to be testing stages in development that would tell you how close to the finished product they were. Now games release as open beta and stay that way for years taking people's money at the same time. That isn't a testing phase. That is a company trying to get money from an unfinished product. \n\nPersonally I don't think beta games should be allowed to charge. The industry is largely unregulated and it shows that these practices have become accepted and normal. And it's leads to situations like this where people have invested in something in good faith which then performs pretty poorly\n\n### Comment ID kca5c5j with +7 score by [(ImpressiveElection94, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kca5c5j/) (in reply to ID kc8yzcr):\nI agree?

While they probably had some start up money (the founders are well respected names in the Gaming industry) that money won't last forever, where do the funds come from for this long of a beta/alpha/testing? They aren't asking for a monthly fee, it's not pay to win even in whatever phase it's currently in, which I confess, is a mystery to me even now but I do recognize they ask for nothing from us. Purchasing sparkly outfits helps to keep the lights on in Palia and pay their people, you know they are hurting when they lay off 35% of their workforce and if I recall correctly they are down to just 109 workers for Palia, while 109 sounds like a lot it's really not for an Online video game, a small workforce like that can strangle a game. Outfit choices are completely optional and NOT forced on you. No one is making you purchase anything. All those people playing for free need to thank the people who do purchase the trivial things from the clothing shop, they are the ones keeping Palia alive at the end of the day. I buy their outfits and I don't even think twice about it because I enjoy the game and DO want to see it fully released and receiving updates, doesn't bother me one bit it's Beta or whatever it is currently.

But beta can't excuse all the problems  Palia has. Nor 'It iS fReE!11\". It's a product above all, and it simply must have some quality in it, otherwise it's just a bad product, free or not, beta or not.\n\nGame breaking bugs that prevent progress; quests that cannot be completed; horrible climbing. Most if not all those things MUST have been fixed in closed alpha (or at least closed beta), not be present in open beta for everyone to see. It's the job of QA department to find and fix those bugs before the game or patch it released. And those guys either don't exist, do their job poorly or have very little time to do it. Then it's management fault, making devs release new  patch every two weeks. But it can't be justified by 'It's just beta!'. It's bad decisions that lead to bad state of the game and then lead to players leaving.\n\nS6 is not a small indie studio, but right now this game is playing like some Steam early access indie game from a single developer. Or even worse, indie game from Patreon.\n\nI wish all well for Palia, but its current state is bad. If it was in alpha, sure, I would have no problem with that. But in open beta?

From there the bug is handed off to either the dev who owns the feature the bug exists in or more like to the production/project management staff who will decide when fixing it fits into the existing timeline and schedule. QA can in most cases argue for an increase in priority for the bug but usually a bug that is not \"this crashes or prevents players from playing the game every time for all system configuration we test on\" will end up finding it's way into the backlog. \n\nAt most places I have worked QA doesn't have access to commit code, nor are they paid enough to expect them to have that skill set. If they do have those skills they either jump ship to the game engineering side of the house or go the technical test analyst/software development engineer in test route and work on writing code to automate tests or make tools to help the manual tests work faster.\n\n#### Comment ID kc8onq5 with +5 score by [(Kirful, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc8onq5/) (in reply to ID kc8jfym):\nOkay, my bad, sorry.

People bicker resources, especially flow, and being able to invite someone to your party would stop a lot of scolding as soon as it starts.

It's immature and oddly self-centered and WAY too on-the-nose with the branding. What I'm about to say is in good faith because I *want* Palia to reach alpha, I *want* S6 to grow. Most are not gonna like it and will downvote because they don't understand the difference between business practices and branding.\n\nThere are specific things that *need* to be stated clearly in updates that weren't even mentioned. The website itself doesn't even have a server/game status page. Not everyone uses discord and it should not ever be the primary communications center.\n\nIf there's a major outage, planned or not, *especially* when they're the ones to pull it offline, that needs to be loud and clear on every platform they use. Scheduled outages should be sending emails as well. IMO it came across as that they *really* didn't want any new or casual players to know there was an outage at all. They *know* the daily players and community members would be on it. But it's the kind of thing you just have to own up to ASAP. \n\nContext: I have 10+ years in risk management, operations training, planning, comms, and hands-on emergency stuff.\n\nWhat their updates should have read like was:\n\n\"Hey everyone, we have some bad news. The patch release didn't go as planned and the demand on the servers plus bugs and errors clashed. We've taken everything offline and are investigating. While we're disappointed that you cannot enjoy Winterlight and the QOL fixes just yet, we understand this is probably even more disappointing for you. We'll let you know as soon as we have any information. You can find status updates at  \\[URL\\]. Thank you for your patience!\"\n\nOnce they had repairs under way and did not have an ETA:\n\n\"Good news is that we've located the issue and have begun correcting it. Unfortunately we don't yet have an estimated uptime and we'll definitely let you know when that changes. We do know that the issue was internal and your game and personal data is safe.\"\n\nClear, kind, respectful, informative, and not full of mealy-mouthed weirdly self-serving brand-speak that never once acknowledged the users except with really condescending comments like \"for those who are being patient\" and \"those who are sending positive vibes!\"\n\nMost of all, it comes across as *we have this under control.* But instead last night it came across as \"wow look at us doing our jobs! isn't that neat! boy are we tired!\" as if they were doing us a favor. \n\nFree or not, every player is still a consumer and S6 is a for-profit business. **This is their job;** no, I will not pat them on the back for doing it. Especially after getting it back online it's still having the same issues. What I *will* commend is if they manage the actual front-facing part well, which they did not. \n\nI know I'm gonna get downvoted for this but sorry, I'm right. I shared the messages with others in comms training and backgrounds. Some were Palians and some were not. I asked them what their impression was of the situation and they all came back with the same thing: short-sighted and unprofessional.\n\n This was a comms disaster. And it still is IMO. Not even mentioning the fact that the Switch thing was pulled with no information whatsoever and it hasn't been addressed as far as I know.\n\nBeta doesn't just mean the game itself but as a new and growing company it also means branding, crisis management, and retention. They are setting an extremely poor example of what happens when things might go even worse and if they do not sharpen communications they will not see the growth they deserve.\n\n### Comment ID kccmfjj with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kccmfjj/) (in reply to ID kc9sqtb):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID kcdtp10 with +2 score by [(relosa_, Reddit, 2023-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kcdtp10/) (in reply to ID kccmfjj):\nThe exact same thing happened to me in the discord when I mentioned how unprofessional it was. What S6 is fostering isn't community (which would be inclusive of *all* players affected by a clearly-avoidable outage; not just \"the ones sending positive vibes!\") what they are fostering is toxic positivity which *will* lead to turning current and future players off for good. \n\nIf I was an investor in this company, I would be pissed that they don't have a dedicated PR/Comms person.

They're suppose to have like a 50million usd warchest for Palia. \n\n3. Unreal engine 4 is a very popular game engine that's been around for a few years with most of the bugs & kinks worked out of it. Frankly it's one of the best & most painless game engine to work with. \n\nFrankly, I like the game. It's has potential. I just wish the devs would hurry up.

People like to say \"but it's a freeeee game\" but it's not. The game is monetized in the way S6 is planning to make money from it. Their intention is to make money and they pretty much told us they need to generate money.

I feel like there's some valid criticism of course after all it's frustrating to be playing a buggy and unfinished game and there's some bugs that are ok in beta and some that are game breaking. Still I'm completely with you, it's a game from a new small studio, no matter how experienced the developers are they don't have the same tools bigger companies do. And beta is their best tool to test and improve their game . I'm a software engineering masters degree student and so the bugs , the time for updates, the unfinished or not yet added features are very normal for me and don't bother me. About the game itself, since I'm busy with school I end up playing for just a few hours a day but I've identified that the game is a bit \"slow\" if you wanna play everyday all the time cus a lot of tasks take time, still there's a lot to do and I haven't explored everything yet. I love most of the objectives of the game and have a lot of fun. It really helps my mental health being so cosy and playing it so light-heartedly . I'm really excited for the festive updates and yesterday I really wanted to play cus I had just came from a test at college and ofc I was sad when they brought the servers back down. but I actually joined the discord like 2 days ago and seeing the updates...they're working, they're trying. And there's nothing more frustrating than finding bugs after fixing other bugs. So uk they're doing their best and that's all anyone can ask.\n\n### Comment ID kcah49k with +12 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kcah49k/) (in reply to ID kc8ecfw):\nCasual reminder this is not a small studio and the funding they have is pretty huge.\n\n## Comment ID kcb5vwk with +3 score by [(Er1nyes, Reddit, 2023-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kcb5vwk/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nI think Palia would benefit from a test server before releasing to the wider Palia community. Other small studios have done this with great effect. Coffee Stain who produce Valheim is a good example.\n\nAll patches were first run thru thier Public Test Server (PTS) before being released to the \"live\" server. Everyone who participated on the pts, knew thier game could be rolled back & progress lost as devs worked out kinks in each update/patch. If you were not prepared to deal with that you simply waited for the updates to go \"live\" and it is probably one of the most stable games still in early release.\n\nI don't doubt for a minute that the S6 team are working their butts off trying to get the game working but I also think they need to concentrate more on core game play before introducing new cosmetics.\n\n## Comment ID kcbjzm6 with +5 score by [(magvadis, Reddit, 2023-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kcbjzm6/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nY'all there is no test server we are the test server.\n\n## Comment ID kc7tlhg with +14 score by [(BosEriko, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc7tlhg/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nWhen people say the team is small i always remember how stardew was created by a single person.\n\n### Comment ID kc8cd26 with +10 score by [(JoanyC11, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc8cd26/) (in reply to ID kc7tlhg):\nUndertale, Rollercoaster Tycon, Stardew, among others were made by single people in ways that are simply extraordinary. But it's exactly that to make a game alone you need to be quite the programming genius, know a lot of different areas and spend probably YEARS AND YEARS developing. Programming is hard (I'm a software engineer master's degree student) and most of the times to develop an app much simpler than a game you need a few elements of a team like a front end and backend developer, a team to make the design, a team to make the unit tests etc etc. It's amazing what some people do but if we expect every studio to do extraordinary things it's like expecting every human that has experience with science to be Einstein or something. Non the less some developers are faster than others and that's ok.

ConcernedApe dedicated his whole life to Stardew in an almost unhealthy way imo. even now, when he talks about it, you can tell he loves it, but he's sometimes so burnt out or frazzled.

Some teams have grandiose visions for 1.0 and leave on the beta label years after what is essentially 1.0. I think the only meaningful metric for a game being or not being in beta is if it is selling any sort of products - which Palia is doing.\n\nAt the end of the day I don't think it matters all that much if a game is in beta or not if you are a player and not a tester. You are rightfully upset if you have issues but you should manage your expectations against the reality of the dev team size and maturity of the game itself. Palia is a recently out beta MMO managed by a small team when it comes to MMO metrics and getting overly upset that it has issues is an error on your part. Take a break from any game if you find yourself overly upset.\n\n### Comment ID kcezam0 with +2 score by [(ImpressiveElection94, Reddit, 2023-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kcezam0/) (in reply to ID kcem21w):\nI srsly don't know what counts as small, but they seem to be around 160 people.

So rounded up 100 Million? Yes, that's initially, it'll be much more now.\nhttps://londonvp.com/news/singularity-6-closes-30m-series-b-for-highly-anticipated-mmo-palia/\n\nApparently AAA games nowadays get hundreds of millions of development cost. https://www.ign.com/articles/major-publishers-report-aaa-franchises-can-cost-over-a-billion-to-make\nhttps://www.gamedesigning.org/gaming/most-expensive-games/\n So, it might be expensive,  but I don't think AAA. Doesn't mean it rectifies the current situation. I know it's not great, at least for Open Beta. And announced Switch Release. And Steam Release. I think they are jumping the gun with that. They might need more time. But I think it's not a catastrophe either. Just...not good.

At least this was the case before all this early access stuff began. But these days it seems more like alpha, where much of the game is still being developed. With every stage of added content we get more bugs. It is just the nature of the industry.\n\nSo I try to remember that I am playing a game that is only 1/4 or 1/3 done. If it gets too buggy I suspend play until I read it has improved. I only get upset when some bug has an impact on my character or account achievement or development and it cannot be reversed or fixed eventually. Like an achievement that doesn't trigger. (Real talk: I do get upset at other lesser things. But when my clear head rules, I remind myself to adjust my expectations to acknowledge the game is a work in progress.)\n\n## Comment ID kc7kon4 with +10 score by [(Lumpy-Narwhal-1178, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc7kon4/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nhttps://i.imgur.com/6I3LjqF.png\n\n## Comment ID kc8uvp3 with +2 score by [(Terrynia, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc8uvp3/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nWhen the servers finally came up at like 10-11pm (USA central time), i went fishing and got the star quality ancient fish….. it was still a lucky day for me!

Been waiting over 4/5 years for the completion of the game! Rejuvenation I meant \n\nPlease Note: I am sober writing this post but let my past experience gaming flow here! Lol!\n\nPalia is a good game, it has A LOT OF POTENTIAL, but it also has a few things that works against it: \n\nLet's start with the paid feature- the store items are too expensive. With or without the pet as an added bonus. If you spread out the costs a little more then people may be inclined to buy more. I don't have any original ideas but others may. \n\nGame play: between the main plot objectives the game gets a bit boring, but then again maybe I Have been playing it wrong because hunting for bugs or fishing may be optional but I'm too stupid to get that whole system- would rather hunt.\n\nTransport/travel: Now as Palia is a magical world without too much technology to ruin the aesthetics it still is a medium sized map (compared to Fallout 4) tiny compared to Minecraft and the Witcher 1 and small compared to Rejuvenation and Reborn.  That being said I became totally enthralled with the idea of (DON'T LAUGH) Hunting Down a MYTHICAL STAG/Bear to RIDE AROUND! Which adds another opportunity for more shop items! Even being able to customize that stag or bear brings a whole new bag of opportunity and problems.  \n\nPuzzles: I love solving puzzles and just hunting down some items that give more lore to the environment: Like what is it with the white structures scattered throughout Palia? Where has the former tenant of your plot of land gone? Is he truly nuts or was he DaVinci or Einstein or Galileo of the Palia universe?   \n\nFishing: I hate the system but then again I don't like that feature in rejuvenation either. But don't take it out I guess I am just a bit stiff about it. Just need to get used to it \n\nBuildings: I like the system you currently have, things clip easily and although it is limited it has great potential- I would just add some rounded structures and an option for top floors and stairs, heck a floor with a hole and a pole to swing down! Vines to climb up and down!  \n\nFurniture use: I don't know I would like to be able to store clothes in a cupboard, Like say I just bought a pink party dress and a green Elvin hunting set of clothes I want to open the cupboard and see them in there, but again don't stress this too much- none of the games I played got this right either!  Which neatly brings me over to the library: I would love to browse and buy books- recipes and bestiaries, I don't know maybe checklists for maybe the bugs and fish you collect with more information per the species you've encountered area they are available in with a spot on the map, time and the kind of fishing rod and bait required? \n\nQuests: Please forgive me but there are times that the dialogue plays and something happens in real life that makes you skip the dialogue by accident: cat jumps on the keyboard, baby slaps the mouse etc. and lets say that dialogue was important but you cannot go back and revisit that conversation which means you've missed something important to the story line or a hint as to where you are to go but a list of DETAILED explanations on the quest may be good for this, I had to go look at Wiki, Google, Reddit and YouTube way too many times as some of the quest descriptions are too vague or do not give you enough information from the get-go. Or add lines and optional clues in character dialogues. \n\nRarity of resources: Now this one may be interesting- bear with me: \n\nFallout 4 has a few medicines that are EXTREMELY RARE: X-Cell, Day Tripper, AND Daddy-O. Minecraft has diamonds that were extremely rare before the newest update, Craft the World has Heroes, Pokémon Rejuvenation and Reborn have Event and Legendary Pokémon: Now bare in mind I haven't really played long enough to completely say I have a handle on what is Really Rare- except for Pallium but this also has an exploit which takes away from it's rare status. May I suggest you remove the Group bonus feature from mining this RARE ingredient? As far as I understand it is Rare for a reason? \n\nFood crafting- I want to be able to see the food I make on a plate (not sure if it's in game but I haven't really explored food crafting too much either), Can I ask that one could be able to buy them from the library too?   \n\nRelationship status: Okay Now THIS was WHAT MADE ME QUIT!  You are told to find a shepp- THAT'S IT!  \n\nYou are not told that \n\n1) YOU CANNOT ASK ANYONE with a FRIENDSHIP LEVEL BELOW LEVEL 4 to be your shepp as they Will REFUSE YOU \n\n2) You cannot ask an NPC to be your Shepp more than ONCE  and Finally\n\n3) The Shepp option is ALWAYS available in the dialogue options thus if you get tired of their drivel and skip too quickly through their dialogue you have a VERY HIGH CHANCE OF Accidently asking them to be your Shepp  and all your hard work is GONE! \n\nFallout 4 has done this dialogue option EXTREMELY well by limiting WHAT you can say to which character at different relationship levels. I am sorry I am not going through all the ups and downs of building up a relationship level again. The characters that I was interested in becoming my Shepp I made the mistake of asking too early. The others bore me to tears or irritate me enough to try shoot them with the bow and arrows (doesn't work) \n\nNow please note I wrote this with a light-hearted approach and I mean this as constructive criticism. All and all I would love to play Palia again- I like the game, but as to the shepp quest- I asked and cannot ask again so this is a wall for me in the game and I won't be returning until that is resolved. \n\nNeither will I pay to play either.\n\n### Comment ID kca3kdl with +1 score by [(ImpressiveElection94, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kca3kdl/) (in reply to ID kc92o0n):\nFirst I'd like to thank you for the time you took to write all this! 😶 And don't worry, I think of it like constructive criticism.\nNow let's get started:\n\nTo the monetization I can't say much about a better approach besides that it may have been a bit too soon, if you think about the progress of the game. I think many might not consider it \"worthy\" of getting money as of now. Me included. As soon as I get the feeling that the game gets \"completed\", I might buy stuff. But that should take time, with what I've seen up till now. But then again, I see many in fancy costumes,  so it might work out after all? How to switch the numbers for more people to buy stuff is something I can't even imagine. I'm just too poor to buy stuff higher than 20€ without batting an eye.\n\nGame play might be repetitive very fast as there isn't much story quests right now, but I'm pretty sure they'll add more. Like more ressources in each category to farm and stuff. I don't think they'll change the system as I think they want the players to be able to do just what they enjoy. At least to a certain extent. You need to mine to make your axe better and stuff. But I think that's pretty normal in games. I find the game cozy and chill besides the bugs.\n\nTransport and Travel: Ooooh, I'd LOVE that!!!\n\nPuzzles: I love puzzles, too! I think some might come with new ruins, but I'd love small ones in the overworld, too!\n\nBuildings: Yes, PLEASE! Especially stairs, as soon as I built just one additional room I wanted it!\n\nLibrary: Yes, that would be great. I wouldn't be surprised, if they already considered it for the future. \n\nStory: Yes, I feel you! Even if I saw everything,  there are times I'd like to be able to look up what was said again. Hope they add something like that. \n\nRessources: There's a group bonus for mining? I know that fishing has it and foraging Flowtrees requires you to have someone tag along if it is a fully grown tree, but mining? I might have missed something? I'm still not a veteran in this game, so there might be things I just don't know. \n\nFood: You can place star quality food in your farm! On tables, in fridges, basically everywhere with a designated surface for putting stuff on/in it.\n\nNow I get back to the clothes as it's already possible with food, so making that available for clothes would be great! Just dunno how much work that is,  as I'm no programmer...\n\nRelationship: Yes, it's not really stated that you need friendship Level 4, before they'll become your Shepp.\nBUT!: You aren't lost! You can still get the person to be your Shepp even though you asked to early! I panicked with Tish as I asked her and the option to ask just disappeared. But through the community I got to know that when you reach Level 4 with your target person and complete the quest for that, after an in-game day the option reappears and you can get your Shepp! Again, it's not stated in-game. I'd like to be informed about both cases (knowing Shepp condition and that you can ask again after Level 4 Quest) in-game.\n\nI hope that alleviates your anxiety, which I felt, too and was really, REALLY unsettling for me, and you can enjoy the game more knowing you can still get your Shepp!\n\n## Comment ID kc8epn6 with +1 score by [(Strong_Investment312, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc8epn6/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nIf we choose to play a game in Beta, we accept that there will be bugs and glitches….it’s your choice to play or not to play.

Know that we’ll keep our players updated with as much information as possible as we approach what we consider to be our official launch.  \n>  \n>We're aware that there has been feedback regarding our messaging and status on various platforms, but the emphasis is that Palia is free-to-play and available for anyone to try. It is a continuous, ongoing effort, and we are committed to providing patch updates with new content, improvements, and bug fixes well into the future.  \n>  \n>In fact, looking at our version, being on 0.178 means we’ve made over 178 updates to the game! Even from the start, and the days of Pre-Alpha, we made sure to include player feedback and have it shape Palia to be where it is today. And when it’s ready, we also plan to have the versioning update from “0.XXX” to “1.XXX” to better reflect Palia’s new status — but even that is not the end. We’ll keep having more patches after, and developing Palia alongside our players. That was one of the primary reasons why we wanted it to be a free-to-play, live-service game.  \n>  \n>We invite everyone to be part of this journey.\n\nFirst of all, when you need to \"clear the air\" that your game is still in beta you've failed at the most basic communication about your game.\n\nThe bare minimum required to provide \"as much information as possible\" as your game approaches launch is to properly inform players that the game hasn't yet been launched. Steam and Epic versions should be in Early Access. Switch should have some form of \"beta\" mentioned somewhere. The word \"beta\" should exist somewhere on the website other than news updates and the EULA. It's a very easy decision to make, and a very easy change to implement.\n\nThis dev update is void of any definitive action they're going to take. They only say that they are aware of the feedback and are focusing on communicating that the game is free (As if the two messages can't coexist LOL). I hope I'm wrong and this is just a poorly worded update, but I don't expect to see any communication changes regarding the beta status of the game.\n\n## Comment ID kx6h2br with +74 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx6h2br/) (in reply to ID 1bqq6c8):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID kx7hkxm with +15 score by [(OreoYip, Reddit, 2024-03-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx7hkxm/) (in reply to ID kx6h2br):\nI am okay with the conversations but honestly, it is getting a bit old hat.

They’ve long discussed issues like this that players have frequently brought up in the past as “beneath them” vibe and no reason for apologies. They will not change. This “cozy” game is meant to be a gatcha game per their design.

UI text size sliders - for people who are playing on Steam Deck for example! Brightness sliders - maybe you just prefer your games to not be that bright! And then other accessibility options  include making the temples doable without having to do complicated maneuvers and having to react at exactly the right time etc etc - some disabled players won't be able to fulfill the challenges at all as they are now, but even players who can fulfill the challenges might not want to do this kind of challenge. I personally get super annoyed with all of the temples, as the rest of the game (except for hunting and some bug catching stuff) is way lower stakes and I fucking hate when I have to jump precisely in games. So I'd profit from an option to do this challenge in an easier way, too (and my keyboard and desk would love that too cause I get really angry and frustrated 😅)\n\n### Comment ID kx4dyj4 with +24 score by [(TheSilentTragedy, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx4dyj4/) (in reply to ID kx4914c):\nAlso this. Many of my friends (many of which were active members of the accessibility channel there) were banned the other day for asking questions, one was banned simply because they wanted to know why their mute had persisted longer than it was supposed to (they were muted for an extra hour instead of the original mute time). \n\nTheir mods/devs have admitted that they have a hard time remaining unbiased regarding critic of the game - in my most respectful and honest opinion, the biggest problem they have (in regard to their Discord) is a lack of a well-acting, level-headed moderation team.\n\n#### Comment ID kx4efjj with +25 score by [(kyleblane, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx4efjj/) (in reply to ID kx4dyj4):\nEarlier on Discord I was asking about details regarding this dev update.

I base it on the reviews. But I'm reading this post from the devs and think they are back peddling due to backlash. Honestly, imo it's easier to justify bugs for games in early access. It would be to their advantage to put it under the early access banner. Why they didn't, I don't really understand. People would give them a pass for bugs. \n\nMaybe they should mention at least in the text of the steam store for the game that it's in beta. Not hidden in the announcement.

Please forgive any crappy formatting on mobile.\n\nDecember 2023 Switch update:\nNo mention of Beta anywhere on the Nintendo eshop page. For weeks leading up to the release multiple members in the discord tagged CMs asking for clarification. CMs would conveniently disappear from conversation or straight up ignore the question while responding to other members. Game launches and what’s missing from the splash page on the switch? The beta tag. The excuse then became “oh well Nintendo doesn’t do beta/early access so take it up with them”. Sandrock was quite literally hosting an early access at this time. \n\nFebruary 2024:\nThey announce the steam release. Members point out that the MMO tag has been scrubbed and there’s no mention of the game being in beta. Every week members would be tagging the CMs to ask and get clarification, warning the CMs that this would lead to negative reviews. The CM response was gifs and saying they’d pass it along to the rest of the team. Members also noted that the Palia website had also been scrubbed of the beta label at this time.\n\nBefore this they were telling people they banned for questioning the lack of beta tag that they had no control over what steam labeled the game as and now it’s too late because once a game has been published you can no longer mark it as early access and beta. \n\nI know this doesn’t matter to some people and I think that’s perfectly fine BUT for some of us a company being intentionally deceitful repeatedly is a big red flag. Many of us have played for hundreds of hours, sunk money into the game and built a community with people inside and outside of the game so we’re feeling quite passionate and honestly concerned about the way things are going. \n\nI’d also like to add this is a team that brags about being industry vets, these are people that know what they’re doing and are now trying to handwave all this away with “oh we’re still learning”. This isn’t a small indie team and hell even small indie teams know to mark a game in beta/EA. Honestly this dev update is only in response to the negative feedback there’s not even any mention of accountability, this wording it reads to me like “well it’s free so who cares”. I care! They have a cash shop and yes it’s optional BUT there is still a way for people to spend money on game by a company that is intentionally trying to mislead its player base and I’m sorry but I’m not okay with that.\n\n### Comment ID kx4ktvz with +24 score by [(kyleblane, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx4ktvz/) (in reply to ID kx4k5ml):\nBravo for good formatting on mobile.

I haven’t left a review and try not to speak negatively of the game even in the discord now because I can see it’s bringing a lot of people joy BUT I also feel like it’s causing people to have major blinders on.

Thanks OP for sharing and I completely agree with your take! \n\nThe update from the Palia team comes off defensive and doesn’t have any accountability in the failure to communicate the status of their game. It being free doesn’t negate it from criticism or basic expectations of knowing it isn’t fully launched. \n\nThis honestly makes me want to uninstall. There are so many other games out there in this genre that handle criticism better, deserve a bigger spotlight, and communicate with the community in a more transparent, productive way.\n\n## Comment ID kx55wzz with +17 score by [(zeoxious, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx55wzz/) (in reply to ID 1bqq6c8):\nFor the record the people who they banned for discussing this are still banned and the community manager said she was too scared to talk to us..\n\n### Comment ID kx57474 with +18 score by [(kyleblane, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx57474/) (in reply to ID kx55wzz):\nTheir community management started out rough and has somehow gotten worse.\n\n## Comment ID kx72xri with +3 score by [(Strawberry_Sheep, Reddit, 2024-03-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx72xri/) (in reply to ID 1bqq6c8):\nThey wouldn't have even needed to clarify they were in Open Beta if they hadn't removed all the wording about it from their website, the launcher, the discord, the store page, etc...\n\n### Comment ID kx7b6n5 with +3 score by [(kyleblane, Reddit, 2024-03-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx7b6n5/) (in reply to ID kx72xri):\nThis is what the fans are missing.

You should be happy we did (the bare minimum) hard work with sit-tech and now you can sit in chairs so stop pestering us.\" Post. (Not the exact quote but it did feel very passive aggressive)\n\nI remember saying that despite this game being free with optional microtransactions, this was going to be one of those barely updated, barely fixed games with barely anything in it worth playing but the store would be absolutely cluttered with new stuff. What happened when I stated that? \n\nDeath threats(yes. I kid you not lmfao) the typical \"It's free. Stop complaining.\", then there were the \"They're taking their time to get it right. If you don't like it don't play it.\" (I stopped around the time they dropped the news that outfits will always be microtransactions) and then people telling me that I was too poor to play the game and I was just a poor hater. Lmao. \n\nWell, despite all those people jumping my butt, I am glad but also disappointed to see that I was mostly right. It's a shame because I hoped they'd take player feedback seriously and make this a game worth sticking around for...but once again, game companies be game company-ing. Glad I didn't hang on to that hope and get let down like I am sure many others have. \n\nI am sorry to those who looked forward to this game being something amazing. Hopefully the game grind loop is enough to keep you playing long enough until a better game comes out for you. Hopefully before they decide that \"It is with a heavy heart that we shut down servers to Palia.\" When theyve finally made enough off their little money maker disguised as a free game.\n\n### Comment ID kx4rbml with +17 score by [(PlantPotStew, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx4rbml/) (in reply to ID kx4mb9l):\nThis reminds me a lot of Disney Dreamlight.

Ideally every game would have a redemption arc like No Mans Sky and Cyberpunk.\n\nIt's exhausting to see casual gamers defend this type of stuff again and again. Sure, they can make their own decisions*, but I thought ignorance was the issue. But it's not, they literally don't care and don't want to care, and... I see this in politics and so many other more important areas that it's just annoying. Companies/whatever are going to keep getting worse because people will keep buying/voting the same way because they just don't care. Worse, they'll shut you down so they can keep living in ignorance.\n\nI get that this seems a bit dramatic, it's just a game, but... eh. It's a pattern. Dystopian Sci-Fi writers don't see the future, they recognize a pattern.\n\n\n*Saying this, because if I didn't, they'd say that it's their right to think so.

You seem more dismissive, then interested, in learning why this could be important. I'm not the best at this topic, but-\n\n> If you don't like it or don't like the devs or don't like their communication, then don't play it! No one is holding a gun to your head forcing you to play or talk about it lmfao\n\nIs a terrible stance to take about this type of stuff. I know you'll probably say \"It's just a game\" but it's important to talk about how companies conduct themselves. \n\nMicrotransactions and other unsavoury tactics like that flourish when people dismiss them as \"Just cosmetics, game is still free.\" Despite games like this specifically attempting to make you spend your money on cosmetics (20$ for a digital outfit). When other companies notice there's a way to squeeze more money out of you, they'll start engaging in worse tactics, making levels specifically harder so you cave and buy more lives just to play the games. Or specifically making the feedback loop more addictive, or making it easier for children who aren't as aware of these tactics to buy things. \n\nYou could say \"It's the parent's job to prevent that\" But we have laws specifically to make dangerous/addictive things regulated, because we understand that the average person might not be educated enough to avoid them.\n\nI don't know if palia specifically falls into this category. But being open about EA is also important. When Disney Dreamlight came out, people bought the full game for 60$, because they specifically hid the fact that it is EA and the full game will release for free later. You're specifically buying to play earlier. It seems small, but the more stuff like that gets hidden as \"Not a big deal\" The more companies will continue to shift around things that they KNOW people want to know, and hide it because if a person did know, they wouldn't have bought/played it. You have a right to know what you are investing (Time, money, etc.) in.\n\nLying by omission, if not called out, is encouraged. You can get games who have been funded by millions only for all the news to be wiffle waffled on. And this keeps happening, because we don't talk about Early Access and the cons with it enough. Because casual gamers don't normally keep up with the news enough to see a pattern and think it's just a fluke that dumb people fell for. That they're smart and will never fall for similar predatory tactics.\n\nWhile people are supposed to make informed discissions, we also have to acknowledge that in the age of overinformation, it's not possible. If the only way to know if something is EA is by going on Twitter, or any other completely unrelated social network, you messed up! Transparency is the most important thing that can be done. If you can only tell it's a beta by seeing 0.2.4.5 version, it's not transparent, it means that people have to be tech savvy enough to understand what section of a version code means it's beta or finished.\n\nI also found from that experience a lot of casual gamers, who admit that this was their only game, didn't really understand a lot of game mechanics. Why having to spend 6+ hours mining rocks to make a basic decoration wasn't an acceptable grind, because they enjoyed doing mindless activities for 6 hours! Don't like it? Don't play it! We didn't, but before we left we decided it was worth explaining why, from our experience of MMO's gone bad, it's a sign on the wall.\n\nWhy having constant bugs and patches introduce more bugs, from experience in EA gone bad, were signs on the walls. \"All games have bugs, jeez\"\n\nWhy having the first microtransaction, from experience in mobile games, were signs on the wall. \"It's just clothing, don't like it? Don't buy it!\" despite a single chair being 20$ \"You don't need it\" Despite more things getting locked further and further, keeping an intentional cycle on FOMO.\n\nThey mostly subscribed to the same philosophy of \"It's free, and I got a lot of content out of it, so who cares about [microtransactions], [terrible dev communication], [terrible grinding mechanics]\" Which is fine, but they also refused to allow others to put in their two pence. Saying \"You're being toxic\" or \"Bringing down the mood\" or \"Why does everyone always have to complain, don't like it, don't play it!\" As if we can't have a discussion on anything but positive things. \n\nI think they see a lot of people, and forget that those individuals don't see others complaints are a part of their own, so instead of one person sharing one problem, it's hundreds sharing that one problem. Making it seem much more dramatic then it is for those people individually. I will admit some people take things too far, especially if the dev starts shutting down any mild conversations, extreme ones start surfacing.\n\nIf you've played video games for decades, you start seeing the same patterns that ruined other companies and games. You start recognizing the trend that gaming is going down.\n\nWe don't play it, but we also learned that boycotting doesn't work and companies will still cut as many corners while getting as much money as possible. We still feel like we should talk about it, at the very least, even if most people just shrug their shoulders and say \"Who cares? I still had fun.\"\n\nSorry, turned long and probably isn't as coherent as I'd like it to be.\n\n#### Comment ID kx5swdt with +4 score by [(ControlledEuphoria, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx5swdt/) (in reply to ID kx4o2h6):\nJust had to say I thought this was incredibly well thought out and perfectly coherent! I agree so much about transparency especially when it comes to beta/EA. I’m considering supporting Farmfolks even though they had a disaster of a first kickstarter based solely on the fact that the new team has been putting out consistent clear messaging. It’s so important we all do our part to try to keep companies accountable so that the beta/ea tag doesn’t immediately tank a game. Especially in the farming/cozy game community because a lot of these games get picked up by people that can’t or don’t have the time to spend navigating discords/reddits/steam forums to learn that the game they just downloaded is incomplete/has issues. Straightforward clear and consistent communication that is easily accessible to a consumer base is key.\n\n### Comment ID kx4gw5o with +12 score by [(Disig, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx4gw5o/) (in reply to ID kx4ecuc):\nYou've completely missed the point of the post.

They don't know they're buying cosmetics for an unfinished game.\n\nSecond, it speaks poorly of their management. Communicating that the game is in beta would only do good things for them and players have been saying this for a very long time. They've banned members of the Discord for questioning it, even going as far as telling them they're spreading false information. There is no good reason NOT to communicate the game is in beta, only selfish, deceitful reasons.\n\nBonus reason: It's good to be clear and honest. They have gone out of their way to remove/hide that the game is in beta, not labeling it as such in obvious, easy places.\n\n#### Comment ID kx8r0ej with +3 score by [(spidersprinkles, Reddit, 2024-03-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx8r0ej/) (in reply to ID kx79r22):\nTbh I just assume that any game that is 'free' with in game purchases is run by a company that is selfish and deceitful. I automatically think that by default and avoid those games. \n\nThey're literally designed to psychologically trick you in the hope you'll wind up spending more money than you would on a regular game. \n\nIt doesn't surprise me that S6 isn't exactly acting like the friendliest company. They literally designed a game with gacha mechanics which is essentially gambling.

Then everyone will be able to download and play the game.\n\nAlso of note the NDA gets lifted at the start of Closed beta so you can share and talk about Palia.\n\n# \"How long will Beta run for\"\n\nBeta will run until the full release of Palia (Date unknown)\n\n# Just a reminder this beta is PC only the Switch version is still planned release for Holiday 2023\n\n# \"will my pc run Palia/What are the recommended specs\"\n\n[https://support.palia.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403291582868-Palia-System-Requirements#highest-spec-0](https://support.palia.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403291582868-Palia-System-Requirements#highest-spec-0)\n\n## Highest Spec\n\n**Quality preset suggestion: Epic (or lower)**\n\nOperating System: Windows 10 64-bit or higherCPU: Intel i7-8700 / AMD Ryzen 7 3700xRAM: 16GBGPU: Nvidia GTX 1080 / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XTVRAM: 8GB\n\n## Recommended Spec\n\n**Quality preset suggestion: High - Medium (or lower)**\n\nOperating System: Windows 10 64-bit or higherCPU: Intel i5-7300 / AMD Ryzen 3 3300URAM: 8GBGPU: Nvidia GTX 1060 / AMD RX 580VRAM: 4GB\n\n## Minimum Spec\n\nEven on more modest setups, the \"Minimum\" setting allows you to experience Palia on lower-powered hardware.

This is just not your Typical MMO when people think of a MMO but an MMO nonetheless.Right now there is a limit to how many people can be on one shard at a time but you can still run into people in the open that you did not invite or get invited to.BUT this makes it to where this is **NOT** an **OFFLINE** game. So you can't just turn it off if you don't want to see anyone  anymore.This next part ties into a new question but also the MMO talk.Housing is **INSTANCED** by every player has their own plot of land and can have multiple late game each plot has its own permissions that can be set for players. Other players have to be invited to come to your Housing plot. And each player has their own respective housing plot rules you as the Plot owner can assign.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese are just some of the questions I have seen around the Reddit plus some on the discord.

Moving between zones will, naturally, spawn you in and out of shards of that zone. Over time as the game learns your preferences and interactions it will assign you weightings for matching with other people. Part of this weighting will of course be things like friends lists and community membership, but it will also be things like progression and gameplay style.\n\nWhat this means is that in the early days, you may not regularly see the same players initially, as the game begins to adjust to you (and of course big influx of new players meaning theres a lot of variety there to be experienced by mixing everyone together) however once the game DOES begin to adjust to you, and you begin to join communities and add friends, you'll start seeing that regularity occur naturally.\n\n### Comment ID jt5dj00 with +4 score by [(AmityCrow, Reddit, 2023-07-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/156t73t/answering_some_questions_i_have_seen/jt5dj00/) (in reply to ID jt43azi):\nBoth good points, the game is being developed to be cross play with Nintendo Switch. They have a 25 player hard cap on how many people can be connected at one time to one instance or layer. I believe this player limit per layer was set just to make it easier and to allow cross play across switch and pc. \n\nSo yes you could run into the same people you meet on your layer the next time, but there is a chance I don't know how often or when it happens that when you leave said layer and come back that you could be put into a different layer with different people. With the friend system you could always add people and invite one another to each other's layer. But there is no way as far as I know to select a layer on login you are just thrown into one. \n\nThe ability to keep seeing the same people on other MMOs is you all are on the same Server/Realm Cluster  depending on population and how many layers are running at the time you are  more Likely to run into said players and recognize them.   \nSince Palia has no server select system you could very well run into the same people since everyone is in the same pool of people, just depends on how many people are playing and how many layers are running.\n\n## Comment ID jt1asqv with +3 score by [(Hopeful_Jellyfish_12, Reddit, 2023-07-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/156t73t/answering_some_questions_i_have_seen/jt1asqv/) (in reply to ID 156t73t):\nOn the housing thing, can we have two houses on one plot?

So the way the housing works is in building blocks. You have your main house in a certain style then you can manage and add different addons to the main house.  \nAs far as I am aware there is no way to have 2 Separate houses on one plot. Other then the starter tent.  So in a sense your Daughter could have her own 'room' extension on the one house on your plot but not a separate house.  \n\n\nThere has been a lot of people asking for community housing in the game for things like this to where people could be around others but have their own house plot right next to neighbors, but that is not currently a thing and we don't know if it ever will be.\n\n#### Comment ID jt3ye6c with +5 score by [(Maclimes, Reddit, 2023-07-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/156t73t/answering_some_questions_i_have_seen/jt3ye6c/) (in reply to ID jt1nyd6):\nMan, that is such a huge disappointment, and possibly a flat-out deal breaker. The entire reason I was looking forward to this game was to recapture the vibes of other co-op cozy games like Stardew Valley and the more recent Roots of Pacha. Both allow you and friends to have your own homes, all open and visible and neighborly within a shared village.\n\nSee, one of the things that makes this work for my family and I is that we all like different things. I like the organized minutia of farming and breeding, my son likes bashing things, and my wife likes decorating and foraging and fishing. So we all go off and do our own things, gathering the resources that are in our wheelhouse, and then return home together to work on our village, where we are neighbors. We can do community-type projects, like working on barns or clearing fields, or we can just beautify our own homes, knowing that we all still get to see and enjoy the things we've done.\n\nBut this sounds weirdly lonely, which sounds kinda ironic for a game built on being an \"MMO\" and community. The only thing we can really do together is gather resources, which is the one thing we DON'T generally do together.\n\nMaybe it'll still work. One of us chooses to sacrifice having a home in exchange for having a communal space we all work on together? Maybe it can still work. Plus maybe we'll be able to go on adventures together? Perhaps? This is a very nebulous sweet spot, and certainly hard to predict the \"vibe\". I'm not even sure I properly described why it doesn't sound right for us, but I know it doesn't *feel* right. The one thing I can say is that we for sure will try it out, because hey! It's free! If we love it, awesome! If not, well, we didn't lose anything by trying!\n\nPossible solutions:\n\n* Multiple buildings on one lot. I didn't even know that wasn't a thing until this comment, and assumed that was our solution. Oops.\n* \"Guild\" shared space. Allow players to form guilds, and have an instanced neighborhood with a central plot and a handful of satellite plots. Everyone could be neighbors, with private homes AND communal space, and all of it would feel like it was \"together\".\n\n#### Comment ID jt25xb7 with +1 score by [(Grepst3r, Reddit, 2023-07-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/156t73t/answering_some_questions_i_have_seen/jt25xb7/) (in reply to ID jt1nyd6):\nYou are also able to own at least 2 plots and you can share permissions so as AmityCrow mentioned you will be able to share the plot.\n\n### Comment ID jt1bxu1 with +1 score by [(mikeytlive, Reddit, 2023-07-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/156t73t/answering_some_questions_i_have_seen/jt1bxu1/) (in reply to ID jt1asqv):\nI don’t necessarily know.

I love the game, I really do, but it's so frustrating when half the stuff doesn't even work. I can't progress main story quests, I can't cook some of the recipes(including some recipes needed for quests) because certain mechanics don't wanna work. Even the furniture tends to be uncooperative sometimes. Some days I can put small items on the bookshelves with no issues, other days I can't put *anything* on shelves. Whenever I talk to other players about it just to vent, it's always \"submit a report ticket\" which is ridiculous, needing to fill out a ticket seemingly every couple days. Half the time I find myself absent mindedly running around in circles doing nothing productive because I need the time to pass and I can't fill that time using some of the game's features because they're broken. I mean no disrespect to the devs, I know without a doubt that they're working their butts off day in and day out, this post is really just to vent some frustrations I have(some of them are likely my own fault, in all fairness). What they have done with Palia so far is amazing, but I feel like part of me wants to step away for a bit until the game is more polished up. Despite all the bugs and broken features, Palia is still an amazing game with a very charming atmosphere and an incredibly wholesome community surrounding it. \n\nSeeing that this post is mostly negative so far, I wanna point out some positive things. For one, the art style of Palia is so fun and lively, especially the characters who give some nostalgic Pixar vibes(which I absolutely adore! Badruu reminds me of the dad from Inside Out for some reason lol). There is not a single character in the game that I dislike, everyone has really enjoyable designs and personalities, they all feel so unique. While the wildlife as a whole feels like it could use more work(like animal variety), it's still really cool to see herds of sernuk grazing or little chapaas scurrying about their areas. The sceneries and landscapes are gorgeous, so many times have I stopped to take a screenshot or two of my current view, it's fun to explore and see what I can and can't climb on, lol. I also really enjoy the farming aspect of the game. It's not too tedious or overwhelming, like in some other farming games, and in fact feels quite satisfying at times. I will say, part of me feels we should have something like 12 soil patches instead of 9, but that just might be me being greedy if I'm being honest lol. Last thing I'll say before wrapping up this post is how great the community surrounding Palia is. I've yet to encounter any bad eggs personally(except for maybe 1 player who broke a pal node in front of a group instead of waiting first, but it's entirely possible they were new and just didn't know better). Just about every player I've spoken too, both in game and on the discord, have been really nice and helpful. I even had an interesting conversation with another player about joint custody over Einar once, which was really funny.\n\nAll in all, Palia is an amazing, one of a kind game despite it having it's fair share of technical issues. I really look forward to what the future holds for Palia and its awesome community\n\nEdit: Thanks for all comments, it's really nice to hear different perspectives from others! To some of the people saying the game is still in open beta, I had no idea. Had I known, I wouldn't have been as critical as I was. The Nintendo Direct that came out 8 or 9 months ago, which is where I first heard of Palia, made zero mention of this fact. Same with when the Switch release date was finally revealed at The Game Awards. As for being told about it when making my account, I never made a Singularity 6 account when I first got the game. I don't remember what I did exactly, but I opted out of making one because I had never heard of this team beforehand and was skeptical. When I continued thru, I was given a warning basically saying that I'd lose everything if something happened to my game because I didn't have an account or something like that, and then it went right on to making my character. At no point did I see anything about the game being in beta. It's possible it said it in the EULA but be realistic here, who actually reads EULAs? Regardless of everything, I'm gonna keep going with the game with a much more open mind now that I know it's still in beta. I plan on continuing my support to both Palia and the wonderful folks at Singularity 6!\n\n## Comment ID krg57zq with +17 score by [(doctorgurlfrin, Reddit, 2024-02-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1aw5ykc/my_thoughts_on_palia_after_playing_for_3_months/krg57zq/) (in reply to ID 1aw5ykc):\nI have a suggestion for the whole “placing items on shelves” issue.

Not everyone enjoys games who are still in open beta, and that is perfectly okay. No shame in that. You can come back in a few months or wait until the game goes out of beta. You clearly enjoy the non buggy parts, so this might be a good solution for you.\n\nFor a game developer it is necessary though to do closed and later open beta. This way they have a big group of test players who can find as many bugs as possible and report them. I feel like this is not made clear when you get the game on Switch though. I have no idea how the beta state of the game is communicated on pc so can’t comment on that. But as a long time gamer I have done many closed and open beta’s for games. So I may have a better understanding of what to expect from a game so early in it’s development. Back in the day (yes I am old, lol) we got clear communication about what was expected of us as test players. Maybe these days that isn’t so clear anymore.\n\nPlaying the game, poking at it to find all the bugs, doing things the devs never expected anyone to try, finding the exploits and so on; these are all our tasks as test players. Even if some players are not really interested in helping the game development, which is fine, it’s still important to play the game knowing the fase it is in. Which again, could be communicated better imho. At least on Switch.\n\nSo perhaps take a break. Come back later when the game is in a state you can enjoy it more. 😀\n\n### Comment ID krgrnb4 with +19 score by [(kyleblane, Reddit, 2024-02-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1aw5ykc/my_thoughts_on_palia_after_playing_for_3_months/krgrnb4/) (in reply to ID krf5n4f):\n>I feel like this is not made clear when you get the game on Switch though.\n\nJust wanted to confirm that Switch players are never informed the game is in beta, which I think is incredibly deceitful since they also have the premium shop available to them.

You can go to the official palia website to see a full list of bugs that they’re aware of and it lists what is actively being worked on. \n\nIf you’re unable to bare with waiting a couple weeks as I said I would stick to the games that you feel are better at doing so.

The patch cadence has been updated following the market to bi weekly or three weeks max! If that seems maybe too difficult to wait for or keep up with as I said I would put the game to the side for a couple-few months. They are a small development team, so it’s not easy to fix every single petty bug that people are complaining about. Along with all of the cosmetic complaints and expectations. \n\nIt’s totally okay to be frustrated with an open beta game, that’s usually why people do decide to stop playing and wait a while! And it’s totally okay to do so. \n\nYou can visit their official palia website and see a list of known bugs and it also lists what they are actively working on for fixes. They are very very very transparent and the list is not small. They are fully aware of many of the things you’ve complained here about, and will be working on them! But again as I said, if it’s too frustrating it doesn’t seem worth it to keep playing. And they’re okay with that!\n\n*and to be clear I don’t mean stupid “petty” I mean small “petty” most of the issues that people have are not horribly awful in my opinion- and are just minor bugs, but all anyone can do is wait it out- and If waiting it out isn’t for you or anyone else it’s totally okay to put the game down for a while!

The cash shop is probably funding their continued work. \n\nThe event seems to be pretty darn popular so clearly it wasn't the worst decision, and it's pretty much exactly what I would expect from a game in beta stability-wise.\n\nVery few bugs and any game breaking ones aren't particularly widespread.\n\n#### Comment ID krk33gt with +1 score by [(PixelSorceress, Reddit, 2024-02-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1aw5ykc/my_thoughts_on_palia_after_playing_for_3_months/krk33gt/) (in reply to ID krgsnb8):\nI’ve played games I’ve paid $60+ that were total garbage (e.g Fae Farm)\n\n## Comment ID krfxlf4 with +4 score by [(uniqueusername_1290, Reddit, 2024-02-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1aw5ykc/my_thoughts_on_palia_after_playing_for_3_months/krfxlf4/) (in reply to ID 1aw5ykc):\nit is still early access so they will have the bugs sorted out in time.. best you can do is just play around it or take a break. \nthe one bug that really got me upset was at the end of Chapaa Chase when the score card would pop up on screen, im not able to close out of it- at all. i’d have to close down my game and start it up again. \n\nother than that this game seems pretty great for being early access. sometimes climbing is glitchy but i honestly can’t wait to see where this game goes! \n\nlike the tips in the loading screen say: “it’s okay to take a break! we’ll be here when you return!”\n\n## Comment ID krfp7sd with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-02-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1aw5ykc/my_thoughts_on_palia_after_playing_for_3_months/krfp7sd/) (in reply to ID 1aw5ykc):\nI think it may be time for a break, even the game recommends breaks during the loading screens. \n\nI also think we need to remember this game is free and in beta. Most of us are probably used to paid games that were completely finished by release. Bugs are unfortunately just the reality. Hell, Cyberpunk 2077 was a mess at first launch because of the bugs and that wasn’t a beta game. We are essentially play-testing this game and helping them find the bugs. \n\nIt can be frustrating when you can’t finish a quest but I like to keep in mind that this game is still in its early stages and there’s always time in the future for those quests. If anything I don’t mind waiting because that just means I have content to finish in the future."

The seniors/leads are very kind and patient in explaining technicalities and they make sure you understand the reason for things to work the way they do. \n\nIf you want to learn and grow in your discipline, S6 is the place to do it. Not to mention you'll get to work on some amazing content!\n\nThe best part of it all, in my opinion, is the team dynamics. Being a skilled professional is important, but couple that with a great personality and you have the perfect colleagues. I did not meet a single employee at S6 that did not fit this bill.",

Some folks became ill from overwork.\n\nLeadership had and still has very little diversity, which is painfully noticeable in the type of decisions taken.\n\nTeam structuring creates massive silo-ing and strong \"our team vs. yours\" in terms of output. Very little collaboration is possible, slowing the whole project down. Never worked at a place so inefficient.",

Very little capable/experienced management, that breeds crunch, teams that are not aligned, competing engineer resources, wheel-spinning, and new priorities near-daily.\n\nPeople are super nice, but might be too nice and not speak up. But our input doesn’t seem to make a difference in leadership choices so maybe people are just burnt out and it seems like “nice” because they're submissive. Also a lot of core people who really cared are voluntarily leaving the studio.\n\nCompare these GD reviews from before August of ‘23 to after. Pre-beta launch the studio was buying the dream, but now we are seeing the reality is not good.",

This applies to frontline managers all the way up to top leadership. This is despite parading a feedback culture. ICs who provide feedback have the feedback turned around and weaponized against them in performance reviews or elsewhere. The company is packed full of very talented ICs who are deprived of the support they need to succeed, and then blamed and take punishment when things don't go the way leadership wants them to. \r\n\r\n\r\n- Dishonesty and deceit is rampant in communication to employees. Never have I seen such a level of dishonest behavior from leadership, especially at such a small company. I can understand a need to be careful on what information to be transparent with, but the leadership very frequently, intentionally, and blatantly lies to everyone at the company about the state of the company. The sad part is that these lies are very shallow and most people see through them, but they serve their short-sighted purpose of keeping the illusion of the \"everything is fine\" dog. One example is telling everyone there will only be a few weeks of \"targeted overtime, not crunch\", knowing full well that it would last indefinitely for many.\r\n\r\n - Diversity problems explicitly ignored by leadership because it's not a \"priority,\" despite the large human impact of them. The company made big promises around D&amp;I to employees, and has failed to live up to them. And recently things have gotten much worse. \r\n\r\nThere are many other problems I did not list here. I fear that many more good people at the company will be hurt by the reckless course management is taking the company.",

Then had a personal disagreement with engineering leadership on topics they know are problematic in the company during a 1:1 and, the very next week, they fired me.\r\nThey also originally hid that it was a firing when they shared with the rest of the company until enough people reached out to me and learned otherwise. Then they edited the Slack message announcing my departure.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, I am not saying leadership failed by firing me. Sometimes firings are the best move (though, I do not personally think that is true in my case, you don't know). I am noting that why it happened, how it happened, and what things occurred and did not occur are all serious concerns for the company going forward.

We can do better here. I truly believe we could be a shining example of how diverse perspectives bring about the most amazing games.",

While S6 has done a remarkable job, particularly during a pandemic, at staying connected, we struggle with projects that require multiple-team coordination. This challenge is also well known and discussed, making it possible to try to improve things rather than just accepting it as it is. While I enjoy the challenge of helping shape how an organization collaborates, if you're looking for well-defined and stable team responsibilities, S6 may not be right for you. \n* While we talk openly about the challenges of creating a diverse workforce in engineering game dev, we are having a difficult time making progress in this direction. While I believe, given our values and culture of respect, people from underrepresented groups would flourish here, we haven't demonstrated the ability to hire diverse candidates yet. Part of this can be attributed to a very senior staff, which skews both our network and our candidate pool, but we need to do better in this space than we are now. \n* While work-life balance is good, it does require self-discipline to balance your time. This project is really exciting and we have a lot of passionate and engaged people. This enthusiasm is contagious and if you're not experienced at holding yourself accountable to other commitments it can absorb a lot of time. The upside is everyone is aware of this and is thoroughly supportive (like I mentioned above) of your away from work. We're in this for the long run.",

While I enjoy the challenge of helping shape how an organization collaborates, if you're looking for well-defined and stable team responsibilities, S6 may not be right for you. \n* While we talk openly about the challenges of creating a diverse workforce in engineering game dev, we are having a difficult time making progress in this direction. While I believe, given our values and culture of respect, people from underrepresented groups would flourish here, we haven't demonstrated the ability to hire diverse candidates yet. Part of this can be attributed to a very senior staff, which skews both our network and our candidate pool, but we need to do better in this space than we are now. \n* While work-life balance is good, it does require self-discipline to balance your time. This project is really exciting and we have a lot of passionate and engaged people. This enthusiasm is contagious and if you're not experienced at holding yourself accountable to other commitments it can absorb a lot of time.

Never have I seen such a level of dishonest behavior from leadership, especially at such a small company. I can understand a need to be careful on what information to be transparent with, but the leadership very frequently, intentionally, and blatantly lies to everyone at the company about the state of the company. The sad part is that these lies are very shallow and most people see through them, but they serve their short-sighted purpose of keeping the illusion of the \"everything is fine\" dog. One example is telling everyone there will only be a few weeks of \"targeted overtime, not crunch\", knowing full well that it would last indefinitely for many.\r\n\r\n - Diversity problems explicitly ignored by leadership because it's not a \"priority,\" despite the large human impact of them. The company made big promises around D&amp;I to employees, and has failed to live up to them. And recently things have gotten much worse. \r\n\r\nThere are many other problems I did not list here.

      "# [The Software Architecture of Palia](https://www.singularity6.com/news/software-architecture-of-palia)\nSingularity6’s debut game, Palia, is a free-to-play cozy online multiplayer community simulator. A place where players can play alone or with their friends to experience a beautiful and welcoming world which can be explored and personalized.\n\nSocial interaction and a persistent shared world are key features of the game. But these elements are also some of the most challenging to implement, scale, distribute geographically, and operate at minimal operational cost and negative player impact.\n\nPlayers experience the art and soul that our development team has poured into the game, but the infrastructure that makes it all possible behind the scenes is hidden from view. We are proud of what our team has accomplished with Palia, and we want to spotlight the studio’s hard work, including what players don’t experience directly. We also want to share some important lessons learned during our journey; we hope that sharing the lessons learned while developing Palia can be useful to others facing similar challenges.\n\nNow follow us behind the scenes of our Palia development journey!\n\nGame Engine\n\nBuilding an online multiplayer title from scratch benefits from a robust and proven game engine. We made the choice to build Palia using Unreal Engine. Unreal gives us powerful tools to build with out of the box, such as a strong networking and replication library to build social features, a graphics pipeline to build a beautiful world, a powerful physics engine that can simulate complex environments, and so much more. We use Unreal Engine for our game servers as well as our client, which gives players a real-time interactive environment.\n\nEach instance of the game server currently hosts up to 25 players, and we split up each server by what we call a map. These can be permanent fixtures, including our central hub Kilima Village, or even temporary available experiences, such as our Maji Market, which was only available for one month during our Luna New Year in-game event. When players travel between maps in Palia, the game client disconnects from one server and connects to a new one. We will share more details on how this works in our matchmaking service deep dive section.\n\nThis synergistic model is crucial for our team: we can develop most of the logic for Palia inside the engine and deploy to both clients and servers. This allows anyone on the team to test both the game and the game server in editor mode, which has been critical for our development velocity.\n\nSpotlight: memory leakage\n\nUnreal Engine servers are commonly used in “session-based games,” such as Fortnite: games that start and end within a certain amount of time. Memory leakage is not a big concern for session-based games because a new server is spun up for a new match and destroyed when the match ends. Any leaked memory will be cleaned before the next batch of players begin playing.\n\nPalia is a persistent shared-world game and the lifespan of our game servers is variable depending on how players move through the game world. A single game server may remain online and serve players for an entire patch cycle which could be weeks. Memory leakage which is cleaned up regularly for a session-based game can grow and compound, and small leaks might end up consuming two or even four times the amount of Random Access Memory (RAM) proportionally affecting our operational costs.\n\nTo combat this issue, we invested in solutions to help us identify memory leaks, and we spent useful time designing nudges for players to travel between maps as to increase the likelihood that a server would empty out and be shut down.\n\nUnexpectedly and fortunately, increasing geographical distribution helped with this problem: hosting servers near players not only helps with latency (because it reduces the distance that signals need to travel); but also with rotating empty servers because players tend to play at the same times, making it rare that somebody in that region is playing in the middle of the night and increasing the probability of servers to become empty, shut down, and cleaned.\n\nThis screenshot from one of our monitoring dashboards shows the memory usage of a portion of our game servers over a24h period in Feb 2024. The trend of linear memory increase is clearly visible.\n\nServices\n\nThe game client and servers talk to our services for specific actions, such as logging players into the game, loading characters, saving progress, sending chat messages to other players, making purchased outfits are stored in the player’s closet and many more.\n\nWe loosely follow a “microservice” posture, in which we prefer to host many different services specialized on one player feature.\n\nWe use HTTP as the North/South protocol (in and out of the datacenter) while we use gRPC for East/West communication (for services talking to each other inside the datacenter).\n\nWe use Rust exclusively as the programming language for our services and we try to include both integration and load testing as part of the definition of “done” for key services, including matchmaking, player presence and player state persistence which represent the largest percentage of our request load.\n\nOur unit and integration tests are also written in Rust, but we use Locust to support and execute our load tests. Locust load tests are written in Python which is simpler to program. The ability to quickly write and modify load tests was beneficial to us and sped up adoption.\n\nSpotlight: Rust for Microservices\n\nRust is a beloved programming language by many systems programmers because it provides state-of-the-art protection against common software vulnerabilities (buffer overflows and race conditions, for example) without introducing any performance penalties.\n\nRust is also a modern programming language. It is surrounded by a diverse and vibrant community of contributors and a wide range of libraries and tools. Documentation is excellent (especially onboarding tutorials) and the compiler is surely one of the most helpful and user-friendly.\n\nOf course, no programming language is perfect. Rust's posture is heavily focused on correctness, which is generally beneficial, but comes with a significant upfront cost which is visible in our development velocity. Rust makes it very hard to “cut corners” and punt hardening for later. It is a very good quality when something that was supposed to be just a prototype becomes load bearing in production by sheer pressure of business needs, but it makes it hard to move quickly and with agility around shifting requirements (which is a constant in startups and game development).\n\nThe other issue was hiring and onboarding. Rust’s relative youth as a programming language makes it somewhat difficult to hire people that have production experience with the language. Although the language is very popular, few people have used Rust in a professional team setting. Most people who have Rust experience have only used it for personal projects. With this in mind, onboarding took much longer than we expected. We factored 90 days to get engineers up to speed, but it turned out to take at least 6 months for most of the team to get comfortable and confident with the language.\n\nWe are very happy with the performance, latency, scalability, robustness and security of our Rust services. But there are moments when we wonder how much opportunity cost was spent in forcing up-front solidity of every piece of this layer.\n\nWe consider it an advantage for the studio to have managed to amortize those onboarding costs and the maintenance costs of our services is indeed very low, but those thinking of following our footsteps down the Rust path, should be willing to allocate a significant effort to education and onboarding. These costs will likely reduce over time as Rust becomes more popular in production settings, but it’s unclear what that rate will be.\n\nSeveral of our services are interesting and sophisticated enough to merit more attention: player state management and matchmaking.\n\nPlayer State Management\n\nWe consider player state all the information that a game server needs to recreate the most recent game world experienced by the player. The architecture of our game is server-authoritative which means that game servers decide the state of the world and act as referees when game clients report inconsistent data (for example, because of time delay in transmission). We took this route because Palia is a social game so a player cheating or modifying their state could have a negative impact on the experience of other players. The risk of cheating is reduced when it's our system that ultimately controls player state.\n\nThe simplest way to persist state is to wait until a player exits a game server and have the server send this information to the database. Unfortunately, this makes state changes in that server vulnerable to the server itself crashing and losing that data (which is only kept in volatile memory for performance reasons). Instead, several times a second we check for player state changes, and if there are any, that data is immediately queued and sent to the database to be persisted.\n\nSpotlight: data first vs. schema first\n\nA source of contention around player state is the modeling lifecycle: who and what decides what is valid to be stored into such a state? Traditional data-modeling techniques suggest a “schema first” approach: the structure of the data (the schema) is created ahead of time and then only data that conforms to that structure can be saved into the database.\n\nThis has the advantage that the database validates the shape of the data. The disadvantage is that one has to know ahead of time the structure of the data needed… which can be challenging to coordinate across different teams.\n\nTo increase the ease with which game engineers and technical designers could work, we decided on a different model in which the structure of the data would be decided in C++ structs directly within Unreal and then marshaled and persisted in the database as a binary blob (using the Flexbuffer format). The schema is the struct declaration itself and we use Unreal’s runtime type reflection system to export the schema to our database.\n\nThe advantage of this architectural choice is that it enabled game engineers to develop features that required state persistence without the need for constant coordination. The downside is that the data is opaque to the database, which is more expensive to keep uniform and consolidated. This has required us to invest in additional tooling around the player state management system to validate, backup, modify and correct player state when it diverges from the expected structure.\n\nDespite the additional layer of development investment needed to provide hardening on top of what the database normally provides, we believe this architecture has significantly cut down the time required to deliver new features with data persistence, such as our most recent Luna New Year event.\n\nMatchmaking\n\nIn many competitive-style online games, matchmaking is the process of selecting people for a match. For Palia, matchmaking means matching the player with the game server that we believe will give players the best gameplay experience.\n\nThere are several dimensions that we take into consideration during matching:\n\nLocation - how far away the game server is from where the player is currently playing (because closer server means lower latency and lower latency means a more fluid and immersive experience)\n\nFriends - how many of the player’s friends are currently playing on that server (because the more people they know the more meaningful their interaction will be)\n\nPopulation - how many people are playing on that server (because the more people are playing the more alive the world feels)\n\nThe matchmaking system is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing us to add more signals to the matching algorithm over time if we desire.\n\nAnother crucial feature of the matchmaking system is the ability to distinguish “join” requests and “travel” requests. A join request happens when a player starts the game and wants to join. A travel request is a match required by a player leaving one map of the game and traveling to another.\n\nThe ability to distinguish the two allows us to offer priority to “travel” requests when the system is under load and there is high contention. This is because it’s far less disruptive for players to wait a few minutes to join and then wait only a few seconds to travel between maps, than one in which the delays are spread uniformly across all matching requests.\n\nThis screenshot shows a piece of the dashboard we use to monitor queue sizes and the distribution of times it takes for a matchmaking request (join or travel) to be satisfied.\n\nSpotlight: game-aware internal queueing and autoscaling\n\nEvery empty server running in the cloud without a player on it is a waste of money. On the other hand, there might be players who want to play and all of the game servers have their allocated slots filled so they would benefit from an empty server to land in.\n\nMany online games design “login queues” or similar ways to restrict the inbound flow of players and scale up or down the number of servers to meet the demand. Originally, this was our intent as well, but we realized we would benefit from a more sophisticated matchmaking design that could distinguish between joining and traveling. We also realized that the matchmaker had all the information it needed to control the size of the game server fleet.\n\nThis is how we came up with the Admiral: a component of the matchmaking system that oversees the fleet of game servers. The Admiral understands when the current fleet of game servers is insufficient to satisfy the number of players requesting a match and is able to ask the underlying cloud system (specifically Agones) to request the creation of more game server instances. Agones, on the other hand, is responsible for shutting down game servers that have been empty for some time.\n\nThe integration of autoscaling with matchmaking and the separation of concerns between the Admiral (scaling up) and Agones (scaling down) has served us very well and has managed to provide us with shock absorption to the game when things didn’t go as planned. Several times, the elasticity of these queues between maps have saved the team from having to bring down the game entirely to fix issues during misaligned deployments or unforeseen behaviors during load spikes.\n\nThis screenshot shows the view of the game servers fleet from the Admiral. Each line is really two lines: one for the “desired size” and another for the “actual size”. This information is used to tell the cloud orchestrator to spin up more game servers for a particular map type as they are needed by players being matched to servers that don’t yet exist.\n\nData Management\n\nOur architecture of loosely coupled software components wouldn’t be very useful without data flowing between them and being persisted, validated, or aggregated.\n\nDatabases\n\nOne of the most difficult elements of creating a shared perpetual world is constructing the ability for players to influence it (and one another) in a context that feels immediate and consistent. A key factor to provide a positive player experience is the choice of the database architecture.\n\nWe decided to use ScyllaDB as our main data persistence layer. ScyllaDB is a C++ rewrite of Apache Cassandra (originally created at Facebook and, in turn, heavily influenced by Google BigTable and Amazon DynamoDB), a distributed column store.\n\nThe biggest advantage of ScyllaDB for us has been its elastic scalability and its cloud native “design for failure” posture that aligned very well with ours. One significant advantage of ScyllaDB for us is the ability to attach replication strategy to a table but eventual consistency levels to a query. This gives us a lot of flexibility because in some cases we need consistency more than we need speed and we can tune that directly at the query level. This is not possible with traditional relational databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL.\n\nThis functionality is crucial, for example, when dealing with a persistent player state: we want the data to be replicated on multiple computers before we return a response to the game server. This means that both the game server and multiple database nodes have to die (at the very same time!) for that player state update to get lost. As far as we can tell, this has never happened.\n\nWe also use PostgreSQL (hosted for us by AWS) for the catalog of our outfits available for purchase in the game. We used a relational database here because we felt it was better suited for this particular job.\n\nAsynchronous Messaging\n\nAnother important part of the data management layer is the ability of software components to message one another asynchronously.\n\nWe have two of such busses:\n\nThe first for aggregates and collects telemetry for player behavior (which uses Apache Kafka, more on this later) and feeds our analytics and machine learning pipelines.\n\nAnother coordinates software components (for example, the control plane between the fleet auto-scaler and the game servers). This uses EMQX as the broker and MQTT as the protocol.\n\nWhy two? Mostly because they serve different purposes, have different strengths and weaknesses, and are managed by different teams focusing on separate outcomes. There might be value in consolidating things further in the future, but for now this separation is serving us well.\n\nSpotlight: MQTT and Apache ActiveMQ v5 (aka Artemis)\n\nThe use of MQTT as the message bus protocol for our game servers control planes was decided precisely to isolate us from lock-in of a particular broker implementation. In retrospect, this was a weak choice: MQTT is an IoT protocol and we were attracted by the fact that it was designed for devices with small power and low bandwidth. We wanted a solution that would be easy and cheap for the game servers to interact with and didn’t consume a lot of their resources.\n\nUnfortunately, many MQTT brokers simply implemented that protocol on top of their existing native systems. We picked Apache ActiveMQ v5 (aka Artemis) because it was established and it supported v5 of the MQTT protocol (which offered features we needed) but was written and designed before clouds existed and turned out to be incompatible with our preferred “loosely coupled components expected to fail” architectural posture.\n\nArtemis has been the source of much apprehension and tribulation. We ended up having to patch the software to fit our needs. We operated with a forked version in production just to keep it from falling over regularly (the MQTT layer and cross-regional federation layers did not work well together).\n\nWe have since migrated to EMQX which is a more modern MQTT broker, designed from the ground-up with MQTT in mind and we have not looked back.\n\nThe lesson learned here is that even established and battle-tested software might still end up performing poorly when utilized in a different context and with different operational constraints than was originally intended.\n\nData Pipelines\n\nAnother important principle of our software architecture is that we want to be able to observe and monitor how the system is behaving so that we can act on it effectively when behavior deviates from the norm.\n\nWe treat data differently based on whether the decision making that it supports is latency sensitive or not. In fact, we use completely different systems for low-latency decision support (seconds to minutes) vs. high-latency (days or weeks).\n\nSpotlight: player behavior vs. system behavior\n\nIn the past, we separated data based on whether it was about player behavior or software behavior. But we quickly realized that distinction was not very helpful in practice.\n\nFor example, a purchasing event from a player is technically a player behavior and insights gathered from them influence strategic decision making with high-latency (days or weeks). But such a high-latency reaction would be detrimental to both our players and our revenue if we didn’t get notified immediately if the frequency of purchases dropped outside of the normal range of operation.\n\nIt is generally true that data generated from the behavior of players influences decision making in aggregate and with high latency while events generated by the behavior of software systems influences decisions and actions that require quick reaction times. But our ability to route data based on decision making latency needs and not on the semantics of origin has made it easier to reason about data routing decisions, especially when the two pipelines are handled by different teams with different skills, strengths, and goals.\n\nObservability\n\nWe picked Prometheus as the time-series database powering the low-latency data pipeline and alerting. The key advantage here is the “pull” model in which it is Prometheus to “scrape” data from our software components, which makes it a lot simpler to maintain.\n\nWe also use Grafana as our visual dashboarding system querying the data stored in Prometheus along with Loki and Tempo to deal textual logs and tracing the flow of execution across several of our software components.\n\nLastly, we use Sloth to automate the generation of SLOs.\n\nAnalytics\n\nThe high-latency data pipeline revolves around Apache Kafka (managed for us by Confluent) which captures and routes the data as well as Apache Spark (managed for us by Databricks), which we use to aggregate and analyze the data.\n\nWe use Apache Airflow (managed for us by Astronomer) for monitoring and scheduling long-running workflows for data aggregation and analysis. Lastly, we use Tableau to power the visualization of the insights that result from our data analysis.\n\nCloud Infrastructure\n\nAnother development challenge is the “free-to-play” nature of our distribution strategy. This approach made it difficult to predict the amount of players that would play the game, especially around key events, such as platform launches, major updates, and in-game events.\n\nWe decided to be “cloud native” from the start because “elasticity” in supply of computation and bandwidth is a key advantage that cloud providers have over acquiring and maintaining our own server infrastructure; especially for gaming startups (for which capital is constrained) and when deploying across multiple geographical regions.\n\nCloud native for us didn’t simply mean: “run our programs on somebody else’s computer.” Cloud native for us meant designing a software architecture composed of small pieces that are loosely coupled and always expected to fail.\n\nWe call this “designing for failure.” Of course, we never want our systems to fail. However, we believe that resiliency in software systems comes less from preventing failure, and more from providing mitigations to such risks and the ability to restore service as quickly and automatically as possible. We want to design to reduce failure but we always expect it to happen, so when it does happen, our systems would not be surprised by it.\n\nKey components of this strategy were using Kubernetes as our orchestration system, Linkerd as our service mesh, Traefik as our load balancer and Agones to manage our fleet of game servers. We also rely heavily on the “infrastructure as code” principle, using Kustomize to help us keep our configurations DRY and ArgoCD to power continuous deployments.\n\nKubecost helps us measure costs, and we recently swapped from cluster-autoscaler to Karpenter to optimize cluster elasticity and to help pick the best server instances. This change allowed us to save a non-trivial percentage of our cloud costs by automating the selection of instance types to use to run our workloads.\n\nFor provisioning infrastructure we rely on Terraform and Spacelift. We rely on Vault to store secrets without our cloud environments. We also conduct chaos testing using Litmus.\n\nAnd we rely on a few different services for authentication and authorization systems, including FusionAuth for account management, Zendesk for customer support management, Stripe for payment processing, and Vivox for our in-game chat system.\n\nOur only cloud provider is Amazon Web Services which provides us computers, storage, and bandwidth across multiple regions: United States, Germany, and Japan. We also rely on Cloudflare for geo-aware DNS and load balancing as well as DDoS protection.\n\nSpotlight: Nomad vs. Kubernetes\n\nWe had originally chosen Nomad as our orchestration solution, mostly because it was perceived to be conceptually simpler and it was much more compatible with Windows workloads (which we thought we might need for testing purposes).\n\nUnfortunately, Nomad had one very significant problem: the momentum of the development community around it was significantly smaller than around Kubernetes. This had two significant issues for us: a) we had to develop in-house solutions that the community around Kubernetes had already implemented; and b) it was harder to engage the team with a technology that many considered an evolutionary dead-end.\n\nWe made the difficult call to switch our cloud orchestration system by using the argument that our development velocity would significantly improve and our operational risks would be reduced. This turned out to be very much the case and it’s a decision we would happily make again.\n\nBuild Systems\n\nThere are two primary concepts used in the building of Palia and its supporting services: the build platform and the build system. Historically, game studios lumped these two together around the primary continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) component. We borrowed some plays from large-scale build and release systems beyond gaming: using a heavily distributed approach inspired by some of our team members’ experiences in other industries, such as banking.\n\nTo power the build system we use Jenkins, but take care to draw a distinction between the software, and the underlying infrastructure upon which it runs and integrates. While related, these things are best served by intentional, separate configuration management and Infrastructure as Code practices which can quickly become unwieldy and complex if attempting to do so under a monolithic design. The result is a hybrid cloud approach to the build system. We use both an on-prem data center and Amazon Web Services, and one side of the architecture can be maintained without potentially negatively impacting the other.\n\nWe also took the time to redesign the initial version of the build system (Jenkins pipelines) around Unreal Engine’s native tooling, namely, BuildGraph. Doing so required a lot of work up-front as the old method was cobbled together between Jenkins Pipelines and Python scripts, but the declarative nature of BuildGraph tooling has allowed us to increase correctness, reduce build system maintenance, and increase flexibility such that we can build almost every target platform with minimal specific changes for each. A key component of this success was integrating with AutoSDK and creating a “standard library” of sorts in Jenkins to glue it all together.\n\nIn our latest version of the build platform we are able to mostly dynamically scale the number of executors based on demand. The build system can then simply act as a “glue layer” to distribute requested tasks among the available executors as parallel pipeline runs. Further, we’ve incorporated designing for Self-Service by other teams, such that they can “pick and choose” which artifacts they want built via a single interface. We call this the “Prime Pipeline,” which presents a series of configurable parameters and then schedules the running of “Sub-Pipelines” to do the work, passing those parameters as appropriate. This means that via the same Prime Pipeline interface, one Engineer could choose to build only one Platform Client from the library of Clients available, and one Server, getting only those two artifacts; or they could select everything and end up with every Client and Server we currently offer as targets.\n\nSpotlight: Capacity Management in a Hybrid Cloud World\n\nA trade-off we make for this level of granularity and distribution is the initial difficulty in managing capacity. We use several build executors of different types and had to really break-down our pipelines and how each stage would be distributed to the executors both on-prem and in AWS. Then we had to measure a single run of each pipeline to get more accurate numbers to use for calculating instance sizes, costs, expected load, and timings for stage and whole pipeline execution. This cost us a lot of time up-front, and while we are glad we did it, it is yet another piece of operational overhead which must be monitored, reviewed, and adjusted in order to remain reasonably accurate. Changing something as simple as the Node Label of a particular pipeline Stage can have serious impacts to all of the metrics we measure, most notably, build times. Unfortunately, there aren't a whole lot of “drop-in” or “off-the-shelf” solutions for these types of systems, so we have had to track these things manually, and then automate as we go to attempt to reduce the operational burden.\n\nFurthermore, managing two different sets of infrastructure is not for the faint of heart, or those unfamiliar with Hybrid Cloud management. While the patterns may be very similar, the implementation proved to be a lot more work than we anticipated.\n\nFor example, AWS and other cloud service providers make APIs available to interact on a very granular level with their exposed components. On the other end of the spectrum, even the most mature on-prem infrastructure providers rely on their own custom tooling for managing hardware components. This is why projects such as Ansible are in such heavy use in the IT industry, and S6 is no exception here as we prioritize the use of open source tools where possible to ease cognitive load and keep costs low.\n\nThe challenge that made this most difficult was the disparity in experience using this approach on our team members’ time. Some of us come from more of a Platforming background, others from a Tooling background, and still others from primarily a Jenkins Pipeline writing background. This is great for general cross-functionality within the team, but requires careful planning to execute well even among the highest-performing teams.\n\nVersion Control\n\nWe use two different version control systems to manage the development lifecycle of our code: Perforce for the game code, and git (hosted in Bitbucket) for everything else.\n\nUsing different version control systems is clearly suboptimal and not a decision we took lightly: git is generally preferred by backend engineers and is far better supported by modern development environments.\n\nUnfortunately, Perforce is very well integrated in Unreal Engine because that’s what Epic Games uses (the makers of Unreal Engine). Also, git isn’t really designed to work with very large binary files, and a lot of our in-game assets and original sources are giant binary files. Perforce works well in these situations.\n\nEarly on, we tried using git-lfs (large file storage), which is supposed to help with this problem but we gave up when we realized how much effort it would be to retrofit all of the Epic development tools (UnrealGameSync, for example) to work with git.\n\nWe sincerely wish we had a single consolidated version control system and code review workflow, but it is not a trivial exercise.\n\nSpotlight: Consolidated Repos\n\nOne of the issues we faced with git was that it was too easy and convenient to create new repositories, causing a proliferation of them. The biggest issue we faced was the inability to make changes that cross-cut different services at once. This created a lot of production overhead and reduced our ability to consolidate the behavior of services.\n\nWe considered switching to a full “monorepo” but many of us were unfamiliar with it and feared additional complexity and overhead that we had no additional development capacity to support.\n\nThe compromise we reached was a handful of consolidated repos in which many individual git repositories were merged into a single repository and then archived. All the microservices ended up in this single repository, but they could be developed, built, tested and deployed in isolation. This made it much easier to modify code across services (such as version dependencies) as well as simplifying the creation of libraries. This approach facilitated an incremental externalization of common functionality into modules that could be more easily reused across services, reducing copy/paste code duplication and reducing our maintenance costs.\n\nSaaS-y Open Source\n\nOne common theme you might have noticed in our architecture is that we prefer to depend on software that is open source and that we could host ourselves if we wanted/needed to. We also prefer to rely on a SaaS vendor that provides and manages this software for us instead of running it ourselves.\n\nThis offers us several advantages:\n\nWe are not locked into a particular cloud or vendor provider (as we could run the system ourselves if we needed to).\n\nWe can provision systems more quickly (our people don’t need to learn the intricacies of configuring them).\n\nLeverage vendor expertise to fix issues and/or edge cases when we encounter them.\n\nKeeps the vendor prices under control under our threat of shutting down our vendor contract and hosting the system ourselves.\n\nWe deviated from this posture only rarely and when there was no open source alternative that made sense for our business needs. However, we do believe this paradigm worked well for us and provides a way to fund and support further development of these open source projects. This, in turn, lowers our future risks by helping make the development of these open projects more sustainable (as these hosting vendors often employ contributors to the open source projects and continue to fund their contributions for mutually symbiotic benefit).\n\nConclusions\n\nIt’s rare to get access to the source code that makes up video games, so it’s rare to have the opportunity to learn directly from it. Even rarer is a view into the decisions and tradeoffs, the lessons learned, the paths not taken and those taken but with later regret.\n\nWe hope that this deep-dive on the challenges and successes of creating Palia’s software architecture provides some insight and inspiration for others facing similar challenges.\n\nIf you have any questions about Palia’s software architecture and development, or simply if you want to start a conversation feel free to reach out to us at hello@singularity6.com.\n\nSpecial Thanks\n\nThe list of people that contributed to this architecture is very long (see the Palia credits for the full list) and we wouldn’t do it justice to replicate it here.

      "# [How Singularity 6’s ‘Palia’ Conquered Cross-Regional Gaming with Amazon EKS and Karpenter on 2024-05-07](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/gametech/how-singularity-6s-palia-conquered-cross-regional-gaming-with-amazon-eks-and-karpenter/)\nIntroduction\n\nDeveloping an online multiplayer game capable of supporting thousands of concurrent players is an incredibly complex endeavor. For Singularity 6 (S6), creators of the hit game “Palia,” which released across platforms in 2023 and 2024—their developers needed to craft an immersive and captivating gaming experience while managing the vast resources and infrastructure required to keep the game’s services running smoothly.\n\nThroughout the development process, unforeseen obstacles and hurdles arose, testing the team’s resilience and problem-solving abilities. Furthermore, launching globally across console and PC platforms introduced an additional layer of intricacy, requiring planning and execution to ensure a seamless experience for players worldwide. To boost their small infrastructure team, S6 leveraged Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) and Karpenter’s flexibility and elasticity while minimizing cost—allowing Palia to reach over 3 million players in six months, in three different Regions, and across four distribution platforms.\n\nThis article describes the process the team at Singularity 6 used to make the Palia launch smooth and successful.\n\nOverview of Palia’s AWS infrastructure\n\nEarly on, Singularity 6 made the decision to host Palia on Amazon Web Services (AWS). As an online multiplayer game, the team understood that Palia needed a “cloud-first” approach. Today, Palia runs using Amazon EKS in three AWS Regions: US West (Oregon) – us-west-2, Asia Pacific (Tokyo) – ap-northeast-1, Europe (Frankfurt) – eu-central-1.\n\nPalia’s backend services run inside an EKS cluster, including the game servers powered by Unreal Engine. For persisting player state across a shared world, Palia relies on ScyllaDB as the database layer. ScyllaDB is highly scalable and designed from the start to be distributed and fast, trading speed for eventual consistency. Palia’s external traffic is routed through a geo-load balanced domain name system (DNS) address to a Network Load Balancer (NLB).\n\nReleasing Palia\n\nDuring Palia’s development, its cloud infrastructure was built entirely in a single datacenter: US West (Oregon). Singularity 6 knew that the studio would eventually need to release Palia in other Regions to reduce latency and improve the player experience. Load testing their system was also necessary to ensure a smooth rollout. Still, there was fear that there were not enough players in alpha tests to accurately simulate launch numbers.\n\nThe team used this opportunity to clone part of their production cloud infrastructure to Frankfurt. As the launch window approached, Palia released in the US first, while leveraging Frankfurt as their load and stress testing cluster, then ran a ScyllaDB copy to evaluate the latency of their queries across Regions on different continents. This “dark multiregional rollout” at the start greatly reduced risks when the game began operating in a multi-regional setting later as the S6 team could gather information on real player behavior.\n\nLoad testing\n\nBefore Palia had any players, Singularity 6 simulated them by writing load tests against their microservices using Locust. Their major focus was stress testing critical backend components, particularly ones that rely on other services to function. To generate sufficient load, S6 wrote a Locust test, ran it from within the Amazon EKS cluster, and then scaled it rapidly and effectively while gathering data that showed how the test systems responded. Using this method, the team identified inefficient code paths, balanced resource requests and limits, and tweaked auto scaling metrics.\n\nChaos testing with Litmus\n\nAfter Singularity 6 saw how their services responded to large volumes of requests, the team decided to inject some chaos into their tests. Their goal was to conduct experiments and observe how the rest of the system responded – especially for critical systems where an outage might cause a cascading failure. Using Litmus, S6 injected latency, created network isolation, and caused outages for specific services. Along the way, S6 constantly asked themselves, “Can we still play Palia?” Chaos testing helped build confidence because the team learned that once players were in-game, many types of chaos had little to no effect on them.\n\nRelease\n\nAhead of launch, Palia’s developers added and tested infrastructure to ensure they could match their player’s demands. Even with all their prep work, S6 encountered rough edges amid successes during their launch.\n\nIssue: Poor VPC planning\n\nWhen Singularity 6 started using Amazon EKS, the team already had a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) module written in Terraform. The module was not perfect, but S6 decided it was good enough to move forward without major changes. However, the team realized that this was the wrong decision within hours of launching Palia when an alert on pending pods revealed that the game had run out of IP addresses in its VPC’s subnets. S6 knew they could add additional subnets to the VPC, but didn’t notice any lines of code that might eventually cause issues in the EKS Terraform module.\n\nThe issue was they were concatenating all their private subnet IDs and public subnet IDs to the EKS cluster’s subnet IDs. When the team added new subnets to the VPC, they were also expanding the EKS cluster control plane onto these subnets. This caused issues when the cluster needed to upgrade or when a managed node group needed to roll its instances.\n\nIn summary, an initial lack of VPC planning led to a proliferation of many unique managed node groups in Singularity 6’s environment. This made it harder to make changes to the EKS cluster as the node groups changed. Below, Singularity 6 discusses how using Karpenter helped reduce their usage of managed node groups, which helped to solve this issue.\n\nSuccess: Templated resource requests and limits\n\nDuring the early ramp up, the team encountered an incident where a component of their Linkerd stack was impacted from running out of memory (OOM). Despite having multiple replicas of this component, they saw other side effects of the OOMKill pod shutdowns, which meant they needed to act quickly. Within a few minutes, the team identified the component being killed and they were able to patch the resource requests to higher limits.\n\nLuckily, S6 had accounted for this issue by adding templating in their Helm and Kustomize to account for setting resource requests and limits. An extra few hours of development work proved instrumental for patching the system while it was scaling and allowing for a smooth experience for their players.\n\nPost release: Adding new Regions\n\nAfter Palia’s release in US West (Oregon), the team finished their infrastructure in Frankfurt and started work to expand further in Tokyo. This was in preparation for Palia’s Nintendo Switch launch, which would bring in substantial new players from Asia. The team knew that providing game servers and services closer to their players would be instrumental to the game’s success, so getting Asia Pacific (Tokyo) online was a natural next step.\n\nIssue: Lack of instance diversity\n\nPalia’s backend, particularly the game servers, requires either a “many nodes with fewer vCPUs” or “fewer nodes with more vCPU” approach. In the Asia Pacific (Tokyo) Region, the team found that their preferred instance types had limited availability than either Oregon or Frankfurt. To solve for this, they decided to explore the use of Karpenter.\n\nSuccess: Using Kustomize for DRY configuration\n\nAdding new Regions revealed an obvious issue in their Gitops-style setup of ArgoCD. Namely, keeping their config (microservice version numbers, chart versions, resource requests and limits) in sync across multiple clusters.\n\nTo solve this, the team turned to Kustomize to further “customize” their DRY configurations and centralize changes such as bumping version numbers. Kustomize allowed S6 to define a single file that contained the version of both the game server and microservices. ArgoCD has excelled at noticing git repo changes and deploying updates to all regions.\n\nUsing Karpenter\n\nAt the end of October 2023, Karpenter moved to a beta readiness. At the time, Singularity 6 was using the cluster-autoscaler and formed several hypotheses that using Karpenter to manage their EKS instances closer to the control plane would provide several benefits, including:\n\nIt removed almost all of the managed node groups by reducing the burden of updating them as the cluster changed.\n\nIt granted the ability to quickly test additional instance configurations such as family, size, and architecture.\n\nIt allowed flexibility to easily adapt to Regions that lack a particular instance type.\n\nIt provided a more nuanced view of the cluster to start instances just-in-time and reduce their idle CPU.\n\nSuccess: Flexibility, experimentation, and idle costs\n\nInitially, Singularity 6 hypothesized that using Karpenter would give them flexibility across instance types, sizes, and even CPU architecture. For example, the team thought it would be straightforward to experiment running Palia on Graviton instances (with ARM processors) without any Terraform changes to managed node groups. Karpenter also streamlined issues with instance constraints in a Region like Tokyo. Finally, by configuring Karpenter to use varied instance sizes and families, S6 was able to run a cluster without any of the overhead of multiple Terraform-defined managed node groups.\n\nUsing Karpenter with its NodePool resource resulted in a reduction of idle game servers in their clusters. By configuring a more diverse set of instances, Singularity 6 was able to decrease idle cost by 75%.\n\nSuccess: Karpenter accelerates Kubernetes upgrades\n\nSwitching to Karpenter removed the need for almost all of their managed node groups. They no longer had an EKS cluster with hundreds of instances across several managed node groups. This simplification, as well as using control_plane_subnet_ids, allowed the team to more easily upgrade their EKS clusters to newer versions of Kubernetes. With fewer instances to launch and less “node group overhead” in their Terraform module, S6 was able to upgrade from K8s v1.26 to v1.28 across six EKS clusters in a few hours.\n\nConclusion\n\nFrom the player’s perspective, Palia’s PC launch went smoothly. The team performed load testing and chaos testing, which ensured the systems scaled properly. The elasticity of AWS offerings proved invaluable for this as they were able to double server capacity from 25 to 50 EC2 instances within hours across multiple Regions. Despite Singularity 6’s best efforts, they still ran into issues due to design choices made very early on.\n\nFollowing Palia’s PC release, Singularity 6’s choice to focus on improving Terraform, Kustomize, and Karpenter, allowed them to rapidly add new Regions to the game and to improve their launch on Nintendo Switch. Again, AWS availability in multiple Regions allowed the team to move from a single Region to a world-wide infrastructure in a matter of months. Moreover, by moving configuration out of Terraform and EKS and into Karpenter, they were able to adapt to resource constraints and more quickly conduct experiments.\n\nIf you are curious about more details about the Palia software architecture, head over to the Singularity 6 blog for a more in-depth overview of this topic.\n\nA special thank you to the Singularity 6 team who contributed to this architecture and blog post: Emily Price, Kyle Allan, Marc Tamsky, Matthew Walter, George Lin, Alec Nunn, Maciej Ciezki, Brian Tomlinson, and Stefano Mazzocchi.",

      "# [Palia’s black market card game is causing player arguments by Cass Marshall on 2024-07-25](https://www.polygon.com/24206154/palia-hot-pot-card-game-arguments)\nLately, there’s been a strangely hostile underbelly in super cozy life sim Palia — and I’m not talking about the hidden cartel gambling pit under the inn. Developer Singularity 6 recently added a cute and simple card game for players to enjoy, called Hot Pot. What should have been another fun diversion in the Stardew Valley-style game has instead revealed a split in the player base.\n\nPalia takes place in the cozy Kilima Village, where players can hang out with the townsfolk, farm, cook, or head out and explore the nearby bustling Bahari Bay. At night, an underground market opens up under the town store. The shopkeep, a cheerful cat-man smuggler, runs the night market from 6 p.m. to 3 a.m.\n\nHere, players can find fancy new toilets, rugs, and paintings for sale, or fish with friends. The main attraction, though, is playing the Hot Pot card game. Playing awards one coin, winning grants two, and after the games wrap up players can queue to spend their coins at a prize wheel. One spin of the wheel costs two coins, and players can win high-end cooking ingredients, adorable plushies, or cool pirate decor.\n\nMany players like to enjoy the underground market as a chill social stop. After hunting in Bahari or talking with all the villagers in Kilima, it can be nice to unwind with a little Hot Pot. The minigame isn’t particularly demanding or competitive; you go around a table of four, trading tiles, until one player has collected three sets of three matching tiles.\n\nA certain faction of players prefers to play “fast” games, though, going around the table as quickly as possible. When one player is about to win, they call out the card they need, and someone else at the table trades it in. This style of play is designed to produce as many coins as possible. If people are sharing tiles, there are no prolonged end-game standoffs, and everyone earns more coins. And when one fast table sets up, and starts filling the chat near the tables with callouts, it can lead to a fight.\n\nOver the past few days, I’ve had multiple sessions of Hot Pot be interrupted by neighboring tables breaking out into arguments. The dialogue usually boils down to “Hey, you’re cheating!” and “No, we’re working together.” Of course, having a public argument is unproductive at the best of times; having one in an online game where everyone is subjected to the back-and-forth due to proximity chat rarely goes well. Everyone in Palia is polite on the surface, during daylight. But at night, fast table debates can break out, and next thing you know the chat is filled with accusations and unsavory insults.\n\nThis argument is part of the tension of Palia; it’s an online sandbox that’s meant to sustain a community, but it’s also a very chill and low-key experience that’s often best enjoyed solo. Most of the time, this works, and the player base is very well behaved. After Hot Pot games, players will line up to spend their coins and spin the wheel, and it’s considered a faux pas to run up and join a game at a table with four players already there. But the fast table debate has broken down the usual etiquette and civility, and I’m curious to see how — or if — Singularity 6 tackles these clashing priorities between players.",

However, despite a myriad of updated content added in time for the latest platform addition in Palia’s repertoire, the reviews remain firmly seated in the ‘mixed’ category.\n\nPatch 0.178 has bloomed (pun intended), and now Palia players can gather flower seeds by capturing bugs, attempt to conquer the Temple of the Roots, finally get their hands on the remaining Emberborn furniture pieces, and even pretend to get married in Bride and Groom attire.\n\nThough the biggest news to come out of Patch 0.178 and Palia’s Steam debut is the massive — both literally and figuratively — Frogbert. This plush grew to this gargantuan size thanks to a huge number of people adding Palia to their wishlist on Steam prior to release and will now be waiting for anyone who plays, new and veteran players alike.\n\nHowever, there is a dark cloud looming over the Steam release of Palia with the accompanying mixed reviews. The feedback comes from new and old players alike, but the biggest stand-out complaints include:\n\nOverpriced Premium Store items, with one bundle of purely cosmetic items costing more than major new releases and no way to earn cosmetic items in-game\n\nLack of ability to link Palia and Steam accounts if you’ve already opened the game, losing any progress made on other platforms permanently\n\nUpdates launched too quickly, many of which have rendered a previously functioning feature completely broken\n\nSevere lack of end-game content, despite the countless updates that have been received\n\nGame not advertised as beta or early access on Steam, despite this status never officially being dropped by developers\n\nFor an MMO, there is a severe lack of multiplayer content (unless you enjoy cooking)\n\nThese are just a few of the most prominent complaints that are coming up time and again in the review section of the Palia store page on Steam, and having spent over 200 hours in the game myself, I have to admit that I can see where they’re coming from.\n\nThese are the same issues that caused me to stop playing two months into the open beta. And although I rushed to download the game on Steam, hoping to try the numerous updates and hotfixes implemented, the negative reviews coupled with my own less-than-enjoyable experience with the game mean it’s going to sit in my library unplayed for a good while yet.",

      "# [Hodari (Palia)/Reader - Works by Whisper (Ambeaniance), KagsChann (KagameDM), Organization for Transformative Works](https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Hodari%20(Palia)*s*Reader/works)\nA year after her emergence, a certain human found herself to be the only one that really stayed and lived where she appeared. The friends she made along the way were too precious for her to leave behind and she found herself dreaming of the unknown future yet to come. But what happens when the past tries to infiltrate what happiness she has developed? Can Hodari pull her out of it before she loses herself to the darkness?\n\nIf you're looking for full smut for the majority of the fanfic, there are plenty of other wonderful stories on this site that you can read. Unfortunately, this will not be one of them as I don't have half the creative mind many of these other authors have! This will delve into some dark themes though. With MAYBE some smut later.\n\nSee notes for trigger warnings.\n\n\"You take a moment to silently watch him work, a true master at his chosen craft. You take note how his arms tense before bringing them down in a powerful swing, a rhythmic motion he repeats over and over as he carves the ore from its resting spot in the Earth. You find it not too dissimilar from a sculptor chiseling one's vision from the marble slab before them. His eyes were heavy and focused on the mass of stone he was chipping away at and clearly he had been at it for quite awhile by this time if the sweat that’s beaded along his forehead and down his temple is any indication. His hair is stuck to his face and you can follow the trail down to a damp shirt and skin that almost seems to lightly glisten in the lantern provided light.\"\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nYou find yourself in an unfamiliar world with a new life before you. Maybe... you'll help someone find a new life too?\n\nYou find yourself in a brand new world, memories locked away, and somehow worst of all, feeling like your naivety makes you stick out like a sore thumb. Wondering if you can even hack it in your new life, you’re determined to keep your head down and try to get by as best you can, wanting only to lead a simple, quiet life as someone not particularly noteworthy. Fit in.\n\nStrange dreams, one fiery young teenager, and her father prove to be quite the disruption to your plans.\n\n(Sequel to You're So Mine. Read that first, please!) You and Hodari have been so physically wrapped up in one another, but eventually there are things that need to be discussed. Sneaking around will eventually become frustrating, and yet you are not sure if this is one-sided. You don't want to complicate Hodari's life more than it already is.\n\nYou and Hodari treat yourselves to a day at the beach after weeks of hard work in the mines. But the labor has put a strain on the relationship in ways neither of you want to admit, and after a pleasant day on the coast of Bahari, it's time that you admit what you've been holding back this whole time.\n\nAll characters, game dialogues, and referenced lore are property of Singularity6.\n\nYou like to go to Bahari to collect resources just as much as the other humans do, but there are also other reasons to visit. Some just happen to be in the form of the resident miner who mentored you in the first place, and always told you to go prepared when you aren't home. It's a \"scorcher\" outside, and just when you were about to get into the act of mining, your pickaxe cracked. Without reparation materials handy, you could either go home, or ask Hodari for his help. You could have only daydreamed about ending up in his bed, but let's just blame the heat, shall we?\n\n--Please note that the story draws from in-game conversations, story line quests, and both In Game Player and NPC journeys. If you have not completed the friendship quest lines to level 4 with both Hodari and Najuma, or Romance questline to level 4 with Hodari, this story will contain spoilers for the game. If you do not wish to see spoilers, I recommend returning to this story after you've completed your in-game quests.--\n\nThis story also references/quotes from individual NPC characters The Protagonist interacts with throughout the story and their daily dialogue lines available by the time you reach relationship level 4 with the Player Character, including daily dialogues, entering conversation lines, and exiting conversation lines. All characters, game dialogues, and referenced lore are property of Singularity6.\n\nAny one-offs between the player character(named Moira in this case bc I would rather DIE than use y/n again) and Hodari I can think of. Will loosely follow canon conversations so spoiler warning ig. Might be silly, might be stupid but it fits because I get so giddy the second I speak to this man omfg. Anyway, enjoy the ramblings of a lunatic. Some fluff, some spice, all will be tagged accordingly. Mainly writing this bc I've read all the other Hodari fics... so... yeah. Enjoy!\n\n**ALL SMUT CHAPTERS WILL BE MARKED WITH [X]!!!***\n\n“You probably can’t relate to this ‘cause you’ve never, y’know, fallen out of a portal or whatever but it’s been a little hard. I’m this weird grown adult who has to learn how to do all this basic stuff that comes so naturally to everybody, even kids! It’s embarrassing.”\n\nHodari tilted his head side to side as he contemplated your words. Finally, he leaned back on his hands and turned to face you, gaze freezing you in place.\n\n“You think too highly of yourself.”\n\n----\n\nOR: the one where PC finds out that they aren't as alone as they claim to be.\n\nSo, someone in the official Palia discord put up a Sketch-tember prompt list (September 2023). I saw it and decided that since I can't draw to save my life, I'm going to write instead. I'm currently behind on the list because life and ADHD brain not letting me, but I will catch up asap.\n\nSingularity 6 owns Palia and all associated characters. It's currently in Open Beta, but I hope you will try it out and enjoy it! I know I love how cozy and relaxing it is (for the most part)\n\nThese are all unbeta'd and any characters being, well, out of character, is all on me. I hope you enjoy reading them as much as I have writing them!\n\nThese are all relatively short vignettes, so you should go through them pretty fast :)",

The game has received mixed reviews on Steam, with players expressing concerns about overpriced premium items, a lack of end-game content, and issues with account linking across platforms [(Destructoid, 2024-03-27)](https://www.destructoid.com/palia-is-finally-on-steam-but-its-not-all-roses/); [(PC Gamer, 2024-07-02)](https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/palia-developer-singularity-6-is-now-part-of-the-daybreak-game-company/).\n\n### Technical Infrastructure\n\nPalia is built using Unreal Engine, which provides robust tools for developing multiplayer features and creating a visually appealing world. The game employs a microservices architecture, utilizing Rust for backend services and ScyllaDB for data persistence. The infrastructure is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), leveraging Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) for scalability and flexibility [(AWS, 2024-05-07)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/gametech/how-singularity-6s-palia-conquered-cross-regional-gaming-with-amazon-eks-and-karpenter/).\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n1. **Acquisition by Daybreak Games**: On July 1, 2024, Singularity 6 was acquired by Daybreak Games, which aims to enhance Palia's development and community engagement efforts [(Daybreak Games, 2024-07-01)](https://www.daybreakgames.com/news/dbg-s6-acquisition-announcement).\n\n2. **Workforce Reductions**: In April and May 2024, Singularity 6 laid off approximately 35% and 40% of its workforce, respectively, as part of a restructuring effort to focus on long-term stability and support for Palia [(Game Developer, 2024-04-08)](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/palia-developer-singularity-6-laying-off-35-percent-of-workforce); [(GamesIndustry.biz, 2024-05-17)](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/singularity-6-laying-off-36-staff).\n\n3. **Technical Challenges and Solutions**: The development team has faced various technical challenges, including memory leakage in persistent game servers and the need for efficient matchmaking systems.

This highlights the challenges of maintaining a cohesive community in an online multiplayer environment [(Polygon, 2024-07-25)](https://www.polygon.com/24206154/palia-hot-pot-card-game-arguments).\n\n## Executive Insights\n\nAnthony Leung, co-founder and CEO of Singularity 6, expressed enthusiasm about the acquisition by Daybreak Games, stating, \"We ultimately want to get Palia into the hands of every gamer that wants to play it and we believe that we can best do so by partnering up with Daybreak\" [(Daybreak Games, 2024-07-01)](https://www.daybreakgames.com/news/dbg-s6-acquisition-announcement). This sentiment reflects the studio's commitment to expanding its player base and enhancing the gaming experience.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSingularity 6 has made significant strides with Palia, establishing a player base of over 4 million and expanding across multiple platforms. However, the company faces challenges, including workforce reductions and mixed player feedback. The recent acquisition by Daybreak Games may provide the necessary resources and expertise to navigate these challenges and further develop Palia into a leading online community simulator. Prospective candidates and investors should consider both the potential for growth and the inherent risks associated with the gaming industry."
