      "# [Singularity 6 is Going Remote Choice](https://singularity6.com/news/s6-remote-choice)\nSINGULARITY 6 was just a team of twenty individuals when we moved into our new office in West Los Angeles. It was 2020, and only two weeks later, the pandemic hit in full swing. We made the call to work remotely, and shared our experience in a previous blog post.\n\nSince then, we’ve announced our first game, successfully ran a number of testing phases, and grew to a company of over 135 people—all while supporting a remote work policy.\n\nBut one big question remained: What was our plan for returning to the office?\n\nWe’re happy to announce that S6 is going Remote Choice!\n\nWhat Remote Choice Means\n\nRemote Choice means we’re championing for our team to decide what’s best for them. They can choose to work remotely, return to our office, or somewhere in-between with a hybrid setup. Save for certain essential roles that require being onsite, this option will be available to our employees indefinitely. At the end of the day, we’re advocating for different needs, preferences, and circumstances of our Sixers, which is why we emphasize the word “choice.”\n\nAlong with the option to work at our LA-based office (and another we’re planning on opening in Orange County, CA), Sixers can choose to work remotely so long as they’re based in the following approved locations:\n\nUnited States\n\nCalifornia, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Michigan, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington\n\nCanada\n\nQuebec\n\nOf course, even with our employees spread across the continent, we’re still making an effort to bring Sixers together. We still want those casual chats and moments of joy that great ideas can come from, so office onsites, local team meet-ups, and digital events are in the works as we move forward.\n\nAnd Yes, We’re Still Hiring\n\nHere at S6, we believe online games can foster meaningful and memorable experiences. Palia will be our first attempt at realizing that vision, and development for it is heavily underway.\n\nTake a look at our careers page for our current job openings, or keep an eye out for future postings as we prepare for launch.

      "# [Adventures in LA: S6 2022 Studio Summit](https://www.singularity6.com/news/s6-2022-summit)\nNew friends, community, crafting, mini-games, adventure… in Palia? Absolutely. But also in-person with the Singularity 6 team coming together at the 2022 studio summit!\n\nThe last week of September saw Sixers from across North America gather in sunny Los Angeles for a wholesome two-day all-hands conference that included nostalgic button-mashing at the arcade, creativity-fueled team bonding sessions, and studio leadership presentations served with a healthy side of memes (stonks, anyone?).\n\nThe summit was Singularity 6’s first company-wide meeting in 2022, and it couldn’t have come soon enough. The studio has more than doubled in size (!!!) since 2021, and the event was the first opportunity for nearly 150 Sixers to take a break from a virtual environment, meet IRL, cut loose, and bond over some friendly(ish) competitive blue shell-tossing kart racing action.\n\n“As our team continues to grow and scale, it was a big priority for us to bring the studio together in 2022,” said Singularity 6 CEO & Co-Founder Anthony Leung. “I was blown away by the energy that our team brought to the summit. It made me so happy to see new and veteran Sixers collaborating and showcasing the best of our company culture.”\n\nOff-key karaoke and welcoming dinner parties are wonderful. But the real (Chapaa?) meat and potatoes of the summit was the overwhelming sense of unity and camaraderie on display from Sixers participating in activities across the board. Group session outcomes in design, art, production, tech, and more proved that Sixers are truly player obsessed.\n\nSessions included no shortage of marshmallow-wielding Sixers working together to construct the tallest – if not the most structurally sound – spaghetti towers. Brainstorming Sixers ‘illuminated’ one corner of the conference room with a rainbow array of Post-It notes. And the entire studio crowdsourced polygonal works of art that represent our company values. Some pieces were more, uh, “abstract” than others. But all in all, these sessions showcased a shared ambition of creating experiences that enhances players' lives and celebrates the intricacies of the human condition through work, play, and community.\n\nAnd with diversity, equity, and inclusion serving as the backbone of the studio — our talented Sixer speakers were empowered to discuss a range of topics that detailed the holistic vision for Singularity 6 and an inclusive studio experience.\n\nWe want to give a HUGE shoutout to S6’s People Ops & Talent Acquisition team who planned the summit’s awesome activities, and we cannot wait to apply key learnings from the event as Singularity 6 continues to grow and build our world class team. Between Sixers hitting the one-two step for S-tier scores in dance simulators, and studio co-founders Aidan Karabaich and Anthony Leung sharing plans for the studio’s future, a refreshed Singularity 6 is poised to deliver games that forge alternate worlds that deepen players’ lives.",
      "# [Palia Community Demonstrates Player Excitement and Appeal of New IP](https://www.singularity6.com/news/palia-community-excitement)\nWe're pleased to share that Palia is showing significant momentum with strong community engagement numbers, including more than 600,000 signups, that demonstrate the growing appetite for an elevated cozy sim experience among a mainstream audience.\n\nWhen revealed in June 2021, Palia was instantly embraced by both core and casual gaming audiences. Within 3 months of the title reveal, more than 600,000 players filled out a survey to playtest the game, outpacing the number of followers of Steam’s most Wishlisted games. An impressive feat for a product still in development (if we don't say so ourselves!), demonstrating a strong desire from players for the type of meaningful online game experience that we're creating.\n\nWe're intentionally building Palia alongside players, as part of the studio’s approach to game development, so that S6 can respond to the community and make improvements at every stage, and over time. Even in the earliest phases of development, the studio cultivated a highly-engaged community that has grown to more than 100,000 Discord members. Additionally, we welcomed nearly 20,000 players across several Alpha tests in 2022 and 2023. In a single Alpha window, players logged more than 167,000 hours in a month, with top players averaging about 200 hours (!!!) of playtime.\n\nOur team is developing Palia to feel welcoming, playful and friendly, which resonated strongly with early adopters looking for a sense of community, acceptance and belonging. By having strong foundations in place for its community from the outset, Singularity 6 has built trust and respect with these early adopters, who continue to help shape the game and have become evangelists for its growing community.\n\nWe look forward to sharing more information about Palia and our amazing community in the future!",

An epic costume contest! And our talented Sixers did not disappoint. From murderous doppelgangers to flailing car dealership air-dancer tubes, the competition was stiff across all categories, such as Most Hilarious, Most Creative and the coveted Audience Choice Award.\n\nAll in all, the gamut of fiendishly-fun activities and costume entries helped make this year’s annual spooky-season celebration the best yet.",
      "# [The Software Architecture of Palia](https://www.singularity6.com/news/software-architecture-of-palia)\nSingularity6’s debut game, Palia, is a free-to-play cozy online multiplayer community simulator. A place where players can play alone or with their friends to experience a beautiful and welcoming world which can be explored and personalized.\n\nSocial interaction and a persistent shared world are key features of the game. But these elements are also some of the most challenging to implement, scale, distribute geographically, and operate at minimal operational cost and negative player impact.\n\nPlayers experience the art and soul that our development team has poured into the game, but the infrastructure that makes it all possible behind the scenes is hidden from view. We are proud of what our team has accomplished with Palia, and we want to spotlight the studio’s hard work, including what players don’t experience directly. We also want to share some important lessons learned during our journey; we hope that sharing the lessons learned while developing Palia can be useful to others facing similar challenges.\n\nNow follow us behind the scenes of our Palia development journey!\n\nGame Engine\n\nBuilding an online multiplayer title from scratch benefits from a robust and proven game engine. We made the choice to build Palia using Unreal Engine. Unreal gives us powerful tools to build with out of the box, such as a strong networking and replication library to build social features, a graphics pipeline to build a beautiful world, a powerful physics engine that can simulate complex environments, and so much more. We use Unreal Engine for our game servers as well as our client, which gives players a real-time interactive environment.\n\nEach instance of the game server currently hosts up to 25 players, and we split up each server by what we call a map. These can be permanent fixtures, including our central hub Kilima Village, or even temporary available experiences, such as our Maji Market, which was only available for one month during our Luna New Year in-game event. When players travel between maps in Palia, the game client disconnects from one server and connects to a new one. We will share more details on how this works in our matchmaking service deep dive section.\n\nThis synergistic model is crucial for our team: we can develop most of the logic for Palia inside the engine and deploy to both clients and servers. This allows anyone on the team to test both the game and the game server in editor mode, which has been critical for our development velocity.\n\nSpotlight: memory leakage\n\nUnreal Engine servers are commonly used in “session-based games,” such as Fortnite: games that start and end within a certain amount of time. Memory leakage is not a big concern for session-based games because a new server is spun up for a new match and destroyed when the match ends. Any leaked memory will be cleaned before the next batch of players begin playing.\n\nPalia is a persistent shared-world game and the lifespan of our game servers is variable depending on how players move through the game world. A single game server may remain online and serve players for an entire patch cycle which could be weeks. Memory leakage which is cleaned up regularly for a session-based game can grow and compound, and small leaks might end up consuming two or even four times the amount of Random Access Memory (RAM) proportionally affecting our operational costs.\n\nTo combat this issue, we invested in solutions to help us identify memory leaks, and we spent useful time designing nudges for players to travel between maps as to increase the likelihood that a server would empty out and be shut down.\n\nUnexpectedly and fortunately, increasing geographical distribution helped with this problem: hosting servers near players not only helps with latency (because it reduces the distance that signals need to travel); but also with rotating empty servers because players tend to play at the same times, making it rare that somebody in that region is playing in the middle of the night and increasing the probability of servers to become empty, shut down, and cleaned.\n\nThis screenshot from one of our monitoring dashboards shows the memory usage of a portion of our game servers over a24h period in Feb 2024. The trend of linear memory increase is clearly visible.\n\nServices\n\nThe game client and servers talk to our services for specific actions, such as logging players into the game, loading characters, saving progress, sending chat messages to other players, making purchased outfits are stored in the player’s closet and many more.\n\nWe loosely follow a “microservice” posture, in which we prefer to host many different services specialized on one player feature.\n\nWe use HTTP as the North/South protocol (in and out of the datacenter) while we use gRPC for East/West communication (for services talking to each other inside the datacenter).\n\nWe use Rust exclusively as the programming language for our services and we try to include both integration and load testing as part of the definition of “done” for key services, including matchmaking, player presence and player state persistence which represent the largest percentage of our request load.\n\nOur unit and integration tests are also written in Rust, but we use Locust to support and execute our load tests. Locust load tests are written in Python which is simpler to program. The ability to quickly write and modify load tests was beneficial to us and sped up adoption.\n\nSpotlight: Rust for Microservices\n\nRust is a beloved programming language by many systems programmers because it provides state-of-the-art protection against common software vulnerabilities (buffer overflows and race conditions, for example) without introducing any performance penalties.\n\nRust is also a modern programming language. It is surrounded by a diverse and vibrant community of contributors and a wide range of libraries and tools. Documentation is excellent (especially onboarding tutorials) and the compiler is surely one of the most helpful and user-friendly.\n\nOf course, no programming language is perfect. Rust's posture is heavily focused on correctness, which is generally beneficial, but comes with a significant upfront cost which is visible in our development velocity. Rust makes it very hard to “cut corners” and punt hardening for later. It is a very good quality when something that was supposed to be just a prototype becomes load bearing in production by sheer pressure of business needs, but it makes it hard to move quickly and with agility around shifting requirements (which is a constant in startups and game development).\n\nThe other issue was hiring and onboarding. Rust’s relative youth as a programming language makes it somewhat difficult to hire people that have production experience with the language. Although the language is very popular, few people have used Rust in a professional team setting. Most people who have Rust experience have only used it for personal projects. With this in mind, onboarding took much longer than we expected. We factored 90 days to get engineers up to speed, but it turned out to take at least 6 months for most of the team to get comfortable and confident with the language.\n\nWe are very happy with the performance, latency, scalability, robustness and security of our Rust services. But there are moments when we wonder how much opportunity cost was spent in forcing up-front solidity of every piece of this layer.\n\nWe consider it an advantage for the studio to have managed to amortize those onboarding costs and the maintenance costs of our services is indeed very low, but those thinking of following our footsteps down the Rust path, should be willing to allocate a significant effort to education and onboarding. These costs will likely reduce over time as Rust becomes more popular in production settings, but it’s unclear what that rate will be.\n\nSeveral of our services are interesting and sophisticated enough to merit more attention: player state management and matchmaking.\n\nPlayer State Management\n\nWe consider player state all the information that a game server needs to recreate the most recent game world experienced by the player. The architecture of our game is server-authoritative which means that game servers decide the state of the world and act as referees when game clients report inconsistent data (for example, because of time delay in transmission). We took this route because Palia is a social game so a player cheating or modifying their state could have a negative impact on the experience of other players. The risk of cheating is reduced when it's our system that ultimately controls player state.\n\nThe simplest way to persist state is to wait until a player exits a game server and have the server send this information to the database. Unfortunately, this makes state changes in that server vulnerable to the server itself crashing and losing that data (which is only kept in volatile memory for performance reasons). Instead, several times a second we check for player state changes, and if there are any, that data is immediately queued and sent to the database to be persisted.\n\nSpotlight: data first vs. schema first\n\nA source of contention around player state is the modeling lifecycle: who and what decides what is valid to be stored into such a state? Traditional data-modeling techniques suggest a “schema first” approach: the structure of the data (the schema) is created ahead of time and then only data that conforms to that structure can be saved into the database.\n\nThis has the advantage that the database validates the shape of the data. The disadvantage is that one has to know ahead of time the structure of the data needed… which can be challenging to coordinate across different teams.\n\nTo increase the ease with which game engineers and technical designers could work, we decided on a different model in which the structure of the data would be decided in C++ structs directly within Unreal and then marshaled and persisted in the database as a binary blob (using the Flexbuffer format). The schema is the struct declaration itself and we use Unreal’s runtime type reflection system to export the schema to our database.\n\nThe advantage of this architectural choice is that it enabled game engineers to develop features that required state persistence without the need for constant coordination. The downside is that the data is opaque to the database, which is more expensive to keep uniform and consolidated. This has required us to invest in additional tooling around the player state management system to validate, backup, modify and correct player state when it diverges from the expected structure.\n\nDespite the additional layer of development investment needed to provide hardening on top of what the database normally provides, we believe this architecture has significantly cut down the time required to deliver new features with data persistence, such as our most recent Luna New Year event.\n\nMatchmaking\n\nIn many competitive-style online games, matchmaking is the process of selecting people for a match. For Palia, matchmaking means matching the player with the game server that we believe will give players the best gameplay experience.\n\nThere are several dimensions that we take into consideration during matching:\n\nLocation - how far away the game server is from where the player is currently playing (because closer server means lower latency and lower latency means a more fluid and immersive experience)\n\nFriends - how many of the player’s friends are currently playing on that server (because the more people they know the more meaningful their interaction will be)\n\nPopulation - how many people are playing on that server (because the more people are playing the more alive the world feels)\n\nThe matchmaking system is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing us to add more signals to the matching algorithm over time if we desire.\n\nAnother crucial feature of the matchmaking system is the ability to distinguish “join” requests and “travel” requests. A join request happens when a player starts the game and wants to join. A travel request is a match required by a player leaving one map of the game and traveling to another.\n\nThe ability to distinguish the two allows us to offer priority to “travel” requests when the system is under load and there is high contention. This is because it’s far less disruptive for players to wait a few minutes to join and then wait only a few seconds to travel between maps, than one in which the delays are spread uniformly across all matching requests.\n\nThis screenshot shows a piece of the dashboard we use to monitor queue sizes and the distribution of times it takes for a matchmaking request (join or travel) to be satisfied.\n\nSpotlight: game-aware internal queueing and autoscaling\n\nEvery empty server running in the cloud without a player on it is a waste of money. On the other hand, there might be players who want to play and all of the game servers have their allocated slots filled so they would benefit from an empty server to land in.\n\nMany online games design “login queues” or similar ways to restrict the inbound flow of players and scale up or down the number of servers to meet the demand. Originally, this was our intent as well, but we realized we would benefit from a more sophisticated matchmaking design that could distinguish between joining and traveling. We also realized that the matchmaker had all the information it needed to control the size of the game server fleet.\n\nThis is how we came up with the Admiral: a component of the matchmaking system that oversees the fleet of game servers. The Admiral understands when the current fleet of game servers is insufficient to satisfy the number of players requesting a match and is able to ask the underlying cloud system (specifically Agones) to request the creation of more game server instances. Agones, on the other hand, is responsible for shutting down game servers that have been empty for some time.\n\nThe integration of autoscaling with matchmaking and the separation of concerns between the Admiral (scaling up) and Agones (scaling down) has served us very well and has managed to provide us with shock absorption to the game when things didn’t go as planned. Several times, the elasticity of these queues between maps have saved the team from having to bring down the game entirely to fix issues during misaligned deployments or unforeseen behaviors during load spikes.\n\nThis screenshot shows the view of the game servers fleet from the Admiral. Each line is really two lines: one for the “desired size” and another for the “actual size”. This information is used to tell the cloud orchestrator to spin up more game servers for a particular map type as they are needed by players being matched to servers that don’t yet exist.\n\nData Management\n\nOur architecture of loosely coupled software components wouldn’t be very useful without data flowing between them and being persisted, validated, or aggregated.\n\nDatabases\n\nOne of the most difficult elements of creating a shared perpetual world is constructing the ability for players to influence it (and one another) in a context that feels immediate and consistent. A key factor to provide a positive player experience is the choice of the database architecture.\n\nWe decided to use ScyllaDB as our main data persistence layer. ScyllaDB is a C++ rewrite of Apache Cassandra (originally created at Facebook and, in turn, heavily influenced by Google BigTable and Amazon DynamoDB), a distributed column store.\n\nThe biggest advantage of ScyllaDB for us has been its elastic scalability and its cloud native “design for failure” posture that aligned very well with ours. One significant advantage of ScyllaDB for us is the ability to attach replication strategy to a table but eventual consistency levels to a query. This gives us a lot of flexibility because in some cases we need consistency more than we need speed and we can tune that directly at the query level. This is not possible with traditional relational databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL.\n\nThis functionality is crucial, for example, when dealing with a persistent player state: we want the data to be replicated on multiple computers before we return a response to the game server. This means that both the game server and multiple database nodes have to die (at the very same time!) for that player state update to get lost. As far as we can tell, this has never happened.\n\nWe also use PostgreSQL (hosted for us by AWS) for the catalog of our outfits available for purchase in the game. We used a relational database here because we felt it was better suited for this particular job.\n\nAsynchronous Messaging\n\nAnother important part of the data management layer is the ability of software components to message one another asynchronously.\n\nWe have two of such busses:\n\nThe first for aggregates and collects telemetry for player behavior (which uses Apache Kafka, more on this later) and feeds our analytics and machine learning pipelines.\n\nAnother coordinates software components (for example, the control plane between the fleet auto-scaler and the game servers). This uses EMQX as the broker and MQTT as the protocol.\n\nWhy two? Mostly because they serve different purposes, have different strengths and weaknesses, and are managed by different teams focusing on separate outcomes. There might be value in consolidating things further in the future, but for now this separation is serving us well.\n\nSpotlight: MQTT and Apache ActiveMQ v5 (aka Artemis)\n\nThe use of MQTT as the message bus protocol for our game servers control planes was decided precisely to isolate us from lock-in of a particular broker implementation. In retrospect, this was a weak choice: MQTT is an IoT protocol and we were attracted by the fact that it was designed for devices with small power and low bandwidth. We wanted a solution that would be easy and cheap for the game servers to interact with and didn’t consume a lot of their resources.\n\nUnfortunately, many MQTT brokers simply implemented that protocol on top of their existing native systems. We picked Apache ActiveMQ v5 (aka Artemis) because it was established and it supported v5 of the MQTT protocol (which offered features we needed) but was written and designed before clouds existed and turned out to be incompatible with our preferred “loosely coupled components expected to fail” architectural posture.\n\nArtemis has been the source of much apprehension and tribulation. We ended up having to patch the software to fit our needs. We operated with a forked version in production just to keep it from falling over regularly (the MQTT layer and cross-regional federation layers did not work well together).\n\nWe have since migrated to EMQX which is a more modern MQTT broker, designed from the ground-up with MQTT in mind and we have not looked back.\n\nThe lesson learned here is that even established and battle-tested software might still end up performing poorly when utilized in a different context and with different operational constraints than was originally intended.\n\nData Pipelines\n\nAnother important principle of our software architecture is that we want to be able to observe and monitor how the system is behaving so that we can act on it effectively when behavior deviates from the norm.\n\nWe treat data differently based on whether the decision making that it supports is latency sensitive or not. In fact, we use completely different systems for low-latency decision support (seconds to minutes) vs. high-latency (days or weeks).\n\nSpotlight: player behavior vs. system behavior\n\nIn the past, we separated data based on whether it was about player behavior or software behavior. But we quickly realized that distinction was not very helpful in practice.\n\nFor example, a purchasing event from a player is technically a player behavior and insights gathered from them influence strategic decision making with high-latency (days or weeks). But such a high-latency reaction would be detrimental to both our players and our revenue if we didn’t get notified immediately if the frequency of purchases dropped outside of the normal range of operation.\n\nIt is generally true that data generated from the behavior of players influences decision making in aggregate and with high latency while events generated by the behavior of software systems influences decisions and actions that require quick reaction times. But our ability to route data based on decision making latency needs and not on the semantics of origin has made it easier to reason about data routing decisions, especially when the two pipelines are handled by different teams with different skills, strengths, and goals.\n\nObservability\n\nWe picked Prometheus as the time-series database powering the low-latency data pipeline and alerting. The key advantage here is the “pull” model in which it is Prometheus to “scrape” data from our software components, which makes it a lot simpler to maintain.\n\nWe also use Grafana as our visual dashboarding system querying the data stored in Prometheus along with Loki and Tempo to deal textual logs and tracing the flow of execution across several of our software components.\n\nLastly, we use Sloth to automate the generation of SLOs.\n\nAnalytics\n\nThe high-latency data pipeline revolves around Apache Kafka (managed for us by Confluent) which captures and routes the data as well as Apache Spark (managed for us by Databricks), which we use to aggregate and analyze the data.\n\nWe use Apache Airflow (managed for us by Astronomer) for monitoring and scheduling long-running workflows for data aggregation and analysis. Lastly, we use Tableau to power the visualization of the insights that result from our data analysis.\n\nCloud Infrastructure\n\nAnother development challenge is the “free-to-play” nature of our distribution strategy. This approach made it difficult to predict the amount of players that would play the game, especially around key events, such as platform launches, major updates, and in-game events.\n\nWe decided to be “cloud native” from the start because “elasticity” in supply of computation and bandwidth is a key advantage that cloud providers have over acquiring and maintaining our own server infrastructure; especially for gaming startups (for which capital is constrained) and when deploying across multiple geographical regions.\n\nCloud native for us didn’t simply mean: “run our programs on somebody else’s computer.” Cloud native for us meant designing a software architecture composed of small pieces that are loosely coupled and always expected to fail.\n\nWe call this “designing for failure.” Of course, we never want our systems to fail. However, we believe that resiliency in software systems comes less from preventing failure, and more from providing mitigations to such risks and the ability to restore service as quickly and automatically as possible. We want to design to reduce failure but we always expect it to happen, so when it does happen, our systems would not be surprised by it.\n\nKey components of this strategy were using Kubernetes as our orchestration system, Linkerd as our service mesh, Traefik as our load balancer and Agones to manage our fleet of game servers. We also rely heavily on the “infrastructure as code” principle, using Kustomize to help us keep our configurations DRY and ArgoCD to power continuous deployments.\n\nKubecost helps us measure costs, and we recently swapped from cluster-autoscaler to Karpenter to optimize cluster elasticity and to help pick the best server instances. This change allowed us to save a non-trivial percentage of our cloud costs by automating the selection of instance types to use to run our workloads.\n\nFor provisioning infrastructure we rely on Terraform and Spacelift. We rely on Vault to store secrets without our cloud environments. We also conduct chaos testing using Litmus.\n\nAnd we rely on a few different services for authentication and authorization systems, including FusionAuth for account management, Zendesk for customer support management, Stripe for payment processing, and Vivox for our in-game chat system.\n\nOur only cloud provider is Amazon Web Services which provides us computers, storage, and bandwidth across multiple regions: United States, Germany, and Japan. We also rely on Cloudflare for geo-aware DNS and load balancing as well as DDoS protection.\n\nSpotlight: Nomad vs. Kubernetes\n\nWe had originally chosen Nomad as our orchestration solution, mostly because it was perceived to be conceptually simpler and it was much more compatible with Windows workloads (which we thought we might need for testing purposes).\n\nUnfortunately, Nomad had one very significant problem: the momentum of the development community around it was significantly smaller than around Kubernetes. This had two significant issues for us: a) we had to develop in-house solutions that the community around Kubernetes had already implemented; and b) it was harder to engage the team with a technology that many considered an evolutionary dead-end.\n\nWe made the difficult call to switch our cloud orchestration system by using the argument that our development velocity would significantly improve and our operational risks would be reduced. This turned out to be very much the case and it’s a decision we would happily make again.\n\nBuild Systems\n\nThere are two primary concepts used in the building of Palia and its supporting services: the build platform and the build system. Historically, game studios lumped these two together around the primary continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) component. We borrowed some plays from large-scale build and release systems beyond gaming: using a heavily distributed approach inspired by some of our team members’ experiences in other industries, such as banking.\n\nTo power the build system we use Jenkins, but take care to draw a distinction between the software, and the underlying infrastructure upon which it runs and integrates. While related, these things are best served by intentional, separate configuration management and Infrastructure as Code practices which can quickly become unwieldy and complex if attempting to do so under a monolithic design. The result is a hybrid cloud approach to the build system. We use both an on-prem data center and Amazon Web Services, and one side of the architecture can be maintained without potentially negatively impacting the other.\n\nWe also took the time to redesign the initial version of the build system (Jenkins pipelines) around Unreal Engine’s native tooling, namely, BuildGraph. Doing so required a lot of work up-front as the old method was cobbled together between Jenkins Pipelines and Python scripts, but the declarative nature of BuildGraph tooling has allowed us to increase correctness, reduce build system maintenance, and increase flexibility such that we can build almost every target platform with minimal specific changes for each. A key component of this success was integrating with AutoSDK and creating a “standard library” of sorts in Jenkins to glue it all together.\n\nIn our latest version of the build platform we are able to mostly dynamically scale the number of executors based on demand. The build system can then simply act as a “glue layer” to distribute requested tasks among the available executors as parallel pipeline runs. Further, we’ve incorporated designing for Self-Service by other teams, such that they can “pick and choose” which artifacts they want built via a single interface. We call this the “Prime Pipeline,” which presents a series of configurable parameters and then schedules the running of “Sub-Pipelines” to do the work, passing those parameters as appropriate. This means that via the same Prime Pipeline interface, one Engineer could choose to build only one Platform Client from the library of Clients available, and one Server, getting only those two artifacts; or they could select everything and end up with every Client and Server we currently offer as targets.\n\nSpotlight: Capacity Management in a Hybrid Cloud World\n\nA trade-off we make for this level of granularity and distribution is the initial difficulty in managing capacity. We use several build executors of different types and had to really break-down our pipelines and how each stage would be distributed to the executors both on-prem and in AWS. Then we had to measure a single run of each pipeline to get more accurate numbers to use for calculating instance sizes, costs, expected load, and timings for stage and whole pipeline execution. This cost us a lot of time up-front, and while we are glad we did it, it is yet another piece of operational overhead which must be monitored, reviewed, and adjusted in order to remain reasonably accurate. Changing something as simple as the Node Label of a particular pipeline Stage can have serious impacts to all of the metrics we measure, most notably, build times. Unfortunately, there aren't a whole lot of “drop-in” or “off-the-shelf” solutions for these types of systems, so we have had to track these things manually, and then automate as we go to attempt to reduce the operational burden.\n\nFurthermore, managing two different sets of infrastructure is not for the faint of heart, or those unfamiliar with Hybrid Cloud management. While the patterns may be very similar, the implementation proved to be a lot more work than we anticipated.\n\nFor example, AWS and other cloud service providers make APIs available to interact on a very granular level with their exposed components. On the other end of the spectrum, even the most mature on-prem infrastructure providers rely on their own custom tooling for managing hardware components. This is why projects such as Ansible are in such heavy use in the IT industry, and S6 is no exception here as we prioritize the use of open source tools where possible to ease cognitive load and keep costs low.\n\nThe challenge that made this most difficult was the disparity in experience using this approach on our team members’ time. Some of us come from more of a Platforming background, others from a Tooling background, and still others from primarily a Jenkins Pipeline writing background. This is great for general cross-functionality within the team, but requires careful planning to execute well even among the highest-performing teams.\n\nVersion Control\n\nWe use two different version control systems to manage the development lifecycle of our code: Perforce for the game code, and git (hosted in Bitbucket) for everything else.\n\nUsing different version control systems is clearly suboptimal and not a decision we took lightly: git is generally preferred by backend engineers and is far better supported by modern development environments.\n\nUnfortunately, Perforce is very well integrated in Unreal Engine because that’s what Epic Games uses (the makers of Unreal Engine). Also, git isn’t really designed to work with very large binary files, and a lot of our in-game assets and original sources are giant binary files. Perforce works well in these situations.\n\nEarly on, we tried using git-lfs (large file storage), which is supposed to help with this problem but we gave up when we realized how much effort it would be to retrofit all of the Epic development tools (UnrealGameSync, for example) to work with git.\n\nWe sincerely wish we had a single consolidated version control system and code review workflow, but it is not a trivial exercise.\n\nSpotlight: Consolidated Repos\n\nOne of the issues we faced with git was that it was too easy and convenient to create new repositories, causing a proliferation of them. The biggest issue we faced was the inability to make changes that cross-cut different services at once. This created a lot of production overhead and reduced our ability to consolidate the behavior of services.\n\nWe considered switching to a full “monorepo” but many of us were unfamiliar with it and feared additional complexity and overhead that we had no additional development capacity to support.\n\nThe compromise we reached was a handful of consolidated repos in which many individual git repositories were merged into a single repository and then archived. All the microservices ended up in this single repository, but they could be developed, built, tested and deployed in isolation. This made it much easier to modify code across services (such as version dependencies) as well as simplifying the creation of libraries. This approach facilitated an incremental externalization of common functionality into modules that could be more easily reused across services, reducing copy/paste code duplication and reducing our maintenance costs.\n\nSaaS-y Open Source\n\nOne common theme you might have noticed in our architecture is that we prefer to depend on software that is open source and that we could host ourselves if we wanted/needed to. We also prefer to rely on a SaaS vendor that provides and manages this software for us instead of running it ourselves.\n\nThis offers us several advantages:\n\nWe are not locked into a particular cloud or vendor provider (as we could run the system ourselves if we needed to).\n\nWe can provision systems more quickly (our people don’t need to learn the intricacies of configuring them).\n\nLeverage vendor expertise to fix issues and/or edge cases when we encounter them.\n\nKeeps the vendor prices under control under our threat of shutting down our vendor contract and hosting the system ourselves.\n\nWe deviated from this posture only rarely and when there was no open source alternative that made sense for our business needs. However, we do believe this paradigm worked well for us and provides a way to fund and support further development of these open source projects. This, in turn, lowers our future risks by helping make the development of these open projects more sustainable (as these hosting vendors often employ contributors to the open source projects and continue to fund their contributions for mutually symbiotic benefit).\n\nConclusions\n\nIt’s rare to get access to the source code that makes up video games, so it’s rare to have the opportunity to learn directly from it. Even rarer is a view into the decisions and tradeoffs, the lessons learned, the paths not taken and those taken but with later regret.\n\nWe hope that this deep-dive on the challenges and successes of creating Palia’s software architecture provides some insight and inspiration for others facing similar challenges.\n\nIf you have any questions about Palia’s software architecture and development, or simply if you want to start a conversation feel free to reach out to us at hello@singularity6.com.\n\nSpecial Thanks\n\nThe list of people that contributed to this architecture is very long (see the Palia credits for the full list) and we wouldn’t do it justice to replicate it here.

      "# [Sixer Game Night 2024: A Night of Neon, Nostalgia, And Non](https://www.singularity6.com/news/sixer-game-night-2024)\nLast week, the Palian moons aligned for Sixers who participated in Sixer Game Night, an epic soirée where Singularity 6 stormed arcades in LA, Seattle, Chicago, and Las Vegas. The vibe was electric as the team gathered to celebrate our love for games, both digital and analog.\n\nThe festivities kicked off with a culinary homage to our childhood favorites. The menu was a mouthwatering spread of comfort food classics: pigs-in-a-blankey, chicken tendies, yummy sliders, mountains of crispy truffle fries, and fruit to stave off scurvy (Arrr!). And what's a Game Night without a few libations to toast our collective camaraderie of creativity?\n\nIt wouldn’t be a Sixer celebration without a lil’ Karaoke; that age-old tradition of belting out tunes with the confidence of Vanilla Ice (regardless of actual singing ability, of course). Several Sixers grabbed (and dropped!) the mic, belting out ballads known and niche. Several smart watches warned against heightened decibel levels. But “In The End,” “I Want It That Way.”\n\nOf course, Singularity 6 is a video game studio, and it’s the arcade where Sixers truly shined. The simulated dance battles were fierce, with team members stepping, hopping, and jumping in a mesmerizing dance of rhythm and coordination-ish. And the kart races were a sight to behold, with friendly rivalries emerging as racers chucked red, green, and blue (!!!) shells across the track for several photo-finish victories (to most folks’ chagrin). A surprise fishing game left us ‘reeling’ after reeling-in some outrageously-sized Tuna. And let's not forget the claw machine – a test of patience and precision as Sixers collected an army of ducks that now embellish several studio workspaces.\n\nBut beyond the games, the laughter, and the sheer joy of human connection; Sixer Game Night was a reflection of what makes Singularity 6 so special. It's the people – our team – who bring their passion, creativity, and enthusiasm to everything we do, whether it's crafting Palia’s next big feature, or quacking about their latest toy waterfowl.\n\nAs the night wound down and we said our goodbyes, it was clear that Game Night wasn't just about playing games. It was about building memories, strengthening bonds, and celebrating the incredible community that is Singularity 6. Here's to many more nights of neon, nostalgia, and nonstop fun.",
      "# [Meet Our Environment Artist, Maya](https://www.singularity6.com/news/meet-our-environment-artist-maya)\nAs Sixers, we like to showcase our small, yet mighty team and highlight their amazing abilities. This month, we’re introducing a few of our employees who are hard at work making our dream for a virtual society happen.\n\nMaya Mahalingam\n\nMaya joined S6 last year as our Environment Artist. She has a strong passion for art and was encouraged early on to explore these skills. Check out her work on ArtStation!\n\nGet to know Maya by reading our conversation with Maya below!\n\nHow did you get started in this profession and what drew you to a career as an artist (no pun intended)?\n\nI have been super passionate about art ever since as a kid, and I loved to draw and paint. I was always very sure that I wanted to pursue a creative career and do something different, so I did a Visual communication bachelors to figure out where my interest was. During my childhood, I remember playing a lot of GTA and NES games after school which fueled my curiosity even more. And so, I ended up working as an artist at a mobile game company and I really enjoyed the experience. I kept up to date on trends and looking into tools that are constantly changing in the 3D space and became super interested in VR. So, I came to the US to further my career and expand my knowledge by doing a Game Dev program at Carnegie Mellon. Since then, I've had the opportunity to work with multiple teams across games, VR and AR space for the past few years.\n\nWhen you were younger, how did you discover a passion for art?\n\nWhen I was growing up, I played tennis professionally for a while and art was like my side interest due to lack of time. But I still enjoyed going to art classes a lot. My parents really encouraged me to explore my creativity and I started painting and doodling whenever I could.\n\nWhat excites you most about being an Environment Artist?\n\nWhat I really like about environment art is that I get to translate my real world observations and bring them to life directly. And, the other nice thing about being an environment artist specifically is that I get to touch a lot of topics in the pipeline, be it technical or purely art itself because of the nature of the role. That I think widens my knowledge and interest of continuing to learn and grow. Also, I've found a recent love to write and share the process about my work and here's my last one: https://80.lv/articles/001agt-005cg-crafting-a-mossy-oakwood-forest-in-ue4-at-cgma/. I wish to continue to do more of that through personal work and our game here at S6.\n\nWhat brought you to LA / S6?\n\nIt was a combination of my interest in environment art, and looking to relocate to LA for personal reasons. So S6 was a great opportunity to be able to do both. I wanted to try something new and different after having worked in VR/AR projects, I wanted to work on a project where I could create a vibrant virtual environment that the players could spend hours exploring and having fun.\n\nWhat have you learned about yourself since becoming an artist?\n\nI think over the years I've learnt how much I can push myself to face challenges and try out new things. I've become more comfortable with accepting what I don't know and what I can do to fix that. And, definitely to be a good person, because at the end of day I think that's what counts.\n\nWhat things in life are still a mystery to you?\n\nHaha the question itself is a big mystery to me. Honestly, I see myself as a mystery because I'm still constantly trying to figure out my traits, my interests and where I'm heading towards in life. So, having to learn about myself and finding solutions for the questions in my head has been really interesting so far.\n\nOf the many things you do, which one makes your heart beat the fastest?\n\nArt! I think if you make something that you enjoy and if it’s something that people find fascinating then that's something to work on with pride.\n\nWhat are you currently working on, without giving anything away?\n\nCurrently I'm working on getting the different aspects of environment art as close to the art bible as possible. And, I’m working on getting Houdini engine setup for some procedural modeling integrated into our pipeline for customizable options in game.\n\nWhat is the one thing in life that makes you happiest?\n\nFirst thing that comes to mind is good food, especially dessert! I can literally eat a Tiramisu or a cake any time. If I am not eating a cake then I am probably baking or thinking about one :D\n\nFor aspiring kids who want to be an artist/designer one day, what advice would you give them?\n\nI would say following your passion is what brings the best out of you. Other than that if it has to be specific to becoming an artist, I would say keep yourself updated constantly. Train yourself to be in a position to be super adaptable to whichever tools become the standard. The industry changes constantly, so having a lot of self discipline and motivation I think is very important. And to make some time to work on personal projects cause I think that really helps to shine a light on your interest.",

You can learn more about the game here.\n\n“Palia creates a lot of opportunities to bring players together and that’s one of the things I’m looking forward to the most,” says Community Lead Edaleen Cruz. “I can’t wait to hear all those stories about friendships that began in Palia.”\n\nGames can help us live life twice as good and if that resonates with you, we invite you to join us on this adventure.",

So they want the company to put more effort into the cash shop than the game. Welcome to the realities of the F2P model.\n\nThese same criticisms were made of Fortnite when it launched.  It's gone on to do just fine, and had continued to have a cash shop of cosmetics that don't affect gameplay.  As long as it's strictly cosmetic, I really don't see a problem.  100% of the game (incomplete as it might be) can be experienced with paying a dime.\n\n### Comment ID jwg9fhv with +12 score by [(Pling7, Reddit, 2023-08-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwg9fhv/) (in reply to ID jwg4lqm):\nFortnite was basically fully actualized as a product though. The problem with Palia lies with priorities. Many systems are unrealized and unpolished compared to other games like it (from much smaller studios) yet the cash shop is already up an functioning. It also begs the question, what are their motivations for doing things the way they do them? Is making the game online in itself done just to sell more cosmetics? Are they going to forgo a more interactive pet system in lieu of one where they can sell cosmetic only pets?  \n\n \\- In a game with such few systems cosmetics play a much larger role in motivating a player. The fact that it's open beta only makes the emphasis on MTX items that much more glaring of a problem (because there's basically nothing to work for at some point).\n\n#### Comment ID jwgi277 with +5 score by [(hyrle, Reddit, 2023-08-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwgi277/) (in reply to ID jwg9fhv):\nWhen Fortnite was in beta, it wasn't a finalized product, though.  It had far fewer features than it has now.  It didn't have several of the systems it has now.  It had far fewer game modes.  In fact, it spent years in beta.\n\nI get the concerns over lack of content in Palia.  I even get concerns about cosmetics costing more than people want to pay (let's face it... any price over $0 is going to be more than some people want to pay.)  But it must be remembered this is a recently-opened live service game that's in beta and shouldn't be critiqued as if it's a complete game.  Even the fully-launched Fortnite continues to evolve, and I'm certain Palia will as long as it is profitable enough to keep it going.    And if it's not profitable, then like hundreds of live service games before it, then it'll close shop as so many F2P games have done before.\n\nIt's understandable that some might not like the direction of that evolution - and it's fair to critique that - but I'm just saying the expectations for a beta should be far lower.\n\n### Comment ID jwgxycg with +2 score by [(MeVe90, Reddit, 2023-08-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwgxycg/) (in reply to ID jwg4lqm):\nI'm surprised they didn't launch a battle pass yet\n\n## Comment ID jwik56a with +6 score by [(Eggsysmistress, Reddit, 2023-08-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwik56a/) (in reply to ID 15ss9gg):\ni thought they were an indie studio at first and was like “aww what a cute game. i’m sure they’ll work hard to make it better”. \n\npfft.\n\n## Comment ID jwjkx17 with +4 score by [(magvadis, Reddit, 2023-08-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwjkx17/) (in reply to ID 15ss9gg):\nIndie has to due with being owned by a major game company. \n\nOne 50 million dollar game does not make you major...at all.\n\n### Comment ID jwjlwc7 with +2 score by [(PsyTripper, Reddit, 2023-08-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwjlwc7/) (in reply to ID jwjkx17):\nThanks for clearing that up.

Is that the budget for the game itself or does it include the budget for establishing the studio legally as a business, leasing office spaces, buying equipment, hiring employees, and other start up costs? I haven't been able to find a solid answer to this so if anyone has a source I'm genuinely curious. I keep seeing people compare them to other studios, but it's always studios that are already established and (I would assume) don't need as much overhead.

Taking away that feature would’ve lost them a ton of players as deeds(the activity that earns the store currency) are a very popular thing for many veteran players to work on once they’ve completed the current end game raids and dungeons. Essentially, the MMO saying “the true end game is fashion” is very much based in reality for LOTRO. The feature has basically been grandfathered in throughout the various acquisitions LOTRO has gone through over the years. (source: I’ve been playing LOTRO off and on for over a decade)\n\nPalia, however, is still very new and, as a result, very malleable. I’m trying to remain optimistic, but I won’t be surprised if this acquisition means big changes for Palia and its monetization. Ultimately, though, if it means the game will make it to 1.0 while retaining its heart and soul, I’ll be ecstatic.

I have seen some games under the Daybreak banner flourish and others fail.\n\nIn the official statement released it does say that S6 and the game development will still stay under the current leadership.  This  lends hope that maybe Palia will have some luck similar to LotRO where Daybreak is more of a \"publisher\" than a developer.  \n\nWill we see more monetization?  Of course.  A game has to have a revenue stream somehow to continue support and development.  This would have been coming regardless of the Daybreak acquisition or not.  And if they didn't, then our favorite world would eventually die out.\n\nAll we can do at this point is just wait and see.  Me personally, I'll continue to play just how I've been playing and watch what changes.  If it starts to change for the better, GREAT!  If it starts to go downhill, then I'll just start looking for a new home.\n\n## Comment ID lb9zaxp with +8 score by [(mistar_z, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb9zaxp/) (in reply to ID 1dt7ujt):\nI'm concerned for the employees. I knew that when they did all those big layoffs earlier this year it meant that they're probably planning for a sale or acquisition, to look better on paper . This sadly isn't great news for the remaining employees as acquisitions normally means more layoffs on the horizon as the leadership restructures the company to their new bottom line.\n\n\nBut on the positive side.

There’s always more layoffs on the horizon. They change the company culture. Just experienced an acquisition myself and so many people are quitting bc after layoffs we’re a skeleton crew and they turned the culture so profit driven.\n\nIf anyone thinks the ethics of Palia are going to stay the same- don’t hold your breath. I wouldn’t be surprised if they stayed pushing ads for in game purchases and went in a different direction with art eventually. \n\nWe can’t forget that S6 is a for-profit company.

I love Palia, and I love what the studio has tried to do with their monetization model, but let’s be honest: it’s not working. If they were making plenty off of people buying the clothing and just wanting to support the company, there wouldn’t have been layoffs. It sucks, but there’s a reason MMOs don’t follow this monetization model, and it’s not JUST corporate greed. I’d honestly prefer to see this than the alternative, where the game just shuts down entirely and everyone who worked on it is out of a job.\n\n### Comment ID lbbfzp5 with +7 score by [(marchviolet, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lbbfzp5/) (in reply to ID lbb2of8):\nI agree.

Daybreak, formerly known as Sony Online Entertainment, launched EverQuest in 1999 and the game is still going. BUT, it has a ton of paid expansion as well as a monthly subscription you NEED to buy in order to be able to play the game, sort of like World of Warcraft.\n\nI kinda see them going for the same model for Palia but i desperately hope they won't. I'd love to have more things i CAN buy but not things i NEED to buy in order for the game to be fun.\n\nIn terms of game longevity i think this is a good move, there are many old games from Daybreak that are still going (kinda) strong for many years.\n\nEDIT: Everquest has recently became free to play, after 25 years lmao\n\n### Comment ID lb8wv8b with +4 score by [(namakost, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb8wv8b/) (in reply to ID lb8sw64):\nI would understand if they took it blindly with whatever daybreak attached to it, but the devs are so passionate that I can't imagine that they wouldn't put some ground rules for monetization since a big part of palias marketing revolves around free content and accessibility for everyone.\n\n### Comment ID lb9dmm6 with +3 score by [(enbyshaymin, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb9dmm6/) (in reply to ID lb8sw64):\n*Formerly known as Sony Online Entertainment and Verant Interactive, co-developers of EverQuest since 1999.\n\nDaybreak's history is weird af. First, they were part of SISA with which they started developement of EverQuest. Then SOE was made and SISA was renamed into 989 Studios. THEN they went into making PS games, while a branch spun off and formed RedEye Interactive which was then renamed as Verant Interactive.\n\nThen they released EverQuest. Later they were controlled by Sony Pictures which iirc was like, it's grandparent company (Sony Pictures owned SOE which owned Verant), and later in 2015 SOE was sold off to Columbus Nova and Verant changed it's name into Daybreak.\n\nWhich they claim no, they didn't, they were bought by Inception Acquisitions... which was related to Columbus Nova. Which was involved with the Renova Group. Which was... in trouble, to say the least, during 2016. Oh, those russians!\n\nThen in 2018 a mobile game company \"strategically\" invested in Daybreak to port games to mobile... and three rounds of layoffs occurred. Things went awry, it got separated into three teams and then in 2020 they were bought by Enad Global 7. \n\nThey also took over MTG Online in 2022, and it seems they had few layoffs since, with a recent one being of \"less than 15 employees\" from their three branches.\n\nAll that said, S6 may be lucky and have no issues now that Daybreak's situation has changed.\n\n### Comment ID lb9kexf with +4 score by [(h39000, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb9kexf/) (in reply to ID lb8sw64):\nI never had issues w the WoW sub because the game *worked*.

My old long time gamer husband tells me this isnt a bad thing at all. I trust his judgement on this because all I am seeing is folks getting their underwear twisted over how the company choose to fund the work on the game. Frankly we are lucky to have had a free game which hasnt had anything but skins behind a paywall. So how about a bit of positivity and hope instead? S6 have as far as I can tell in the 4 months of playing, given players practically everything they could do within the game mechanics as it stands.  Wanted plushies? you got them.. wanted trees? got them, wanted flow trees on your plot? you got them! Wanted hotpot back? we got it! Bigger houses? got that too....! S6 have listened and delivered where they can. So enough whining and moaning about their partnership with an established game provider, they can rehire, and hopefully we will see the fruits of this soon! If you dont want to buy into stuff then dont but if you are going to moan about a FREE to play game that is still currently in dev mode then you really need to find something else to do with your life.   \nPersonally I think this is rather exciting for S6, it shows confidence from the industry that Palia is viable for the future.\n\n### Comment ID lbbgeoy with +6 score by [(marchviolet, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lbbgeoy/) (in reply to ID lbasarc):\nMy own longtime gamer husband also had a relatively positive reaction to this news when I shared it with him.

They are pretty much the exact opposite of what S6 was about when it comes to monetization. The fact S6 was even open to an acquisition in the first place isn't a good sign but if you couple that with them actually going through with it with such a publisher speaks volumes. This one line from the official acquisition statement says it all.\n\n\"It is incredibly exciting to find like-minded partners who share in our commitment to investing in our products and players for the long-term\"\n\nLet's focus on this a little, \"products\" and \"players\". First off, S6 would never refer to the game as a \"product\", so right from the start you know this section wasn't written by them. Secondly, any time a company mentions 2 things under the same context you should always read them separately like this.\n\n\"It is incredibly exciting to find like-minded partners who share in our commitment to investing in our products\"\n\n\"It is incredibly exciting to find like-minded partners who share in our commitment to investing in our players for the long-term\"\n\nRead that last one about players and what does it sound like to you? I'll spell it out for you just in case...we are the product, not the game. They have invested in a new player base that is outside there normal target audience. Whether this is good or bad will remain to be seen but they have an expectation of a return on that investment and with a game like Palia that could be tricky. It costs more to create something new then it does to place artificial limitations on us and people are far more likely to spend money on a better experience then on a prettier one. So like I originally said, hope for the best but prepare for the worst because the odds are not in our favor here by a long shot and it really pains me because I love this game.\n\nEDIT: Somehow the other half of my comment got cut when I posted lol. So here is my optimistic side.\n\nThis DOES have a bright side to it. Investment from a bigger company can be a really good thing. Most of the games under Daydreams publishing are actually good games if you ignore the monetization factor. The world building and lore behind most of them are top notch, but the story writing tends to be a little lack luster. S6 however has great writing and a LOT of lore and world elements to build upon so with Daydreams backing Palia has a lot going for it in a good way.\n\n## Comment ID lb83d6r with +9 score by [(haffasandwitch, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb83d6r/) (in reply to ID 1dt7ujt):\n![gif](giphy|7doqMMIYTH1Zkq9mpY|downsized)\n\n## Comment ID lbbmyo0 with +5 score by [(TwistedReads, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lbbmyo0/) (in reply to ID 1dt7ujt):\nwell. good run everyone see you in the next game!\n\n## Comment ID lbdyjsa with +4 score by [(evaperated, Reddit, 2024-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lbdyjsa/) (in reply to ID 1dt7ujt):\nHonestly I’m a huge fan of the battle pass model, and would welcome something like that in Palia.

Yes/why not?\n\n**Customization:**\n\n* Any plans to expand outfit customizability (separating items into smaller pieces, like boots and trousers, shirts and gloves/dyes or more color swatches)?\n* Will the new body types be full presets or will there be sliders?\n* How are the current cosmetics going to work with new body types/body customization?\n* Any plans to expand face customization (except for facial hair)?\n\n**Multiplayer:**\n\n* How are you planning to deal with resource shortage and competitiveness it's causing?\n* Will there be incentives for partying up/joining a community?\n* What kind of group content can we look forward to?\n* Will trading be a thing in the future?\n* Will there be emotes for 2+ players (high fives, hugs, etc)?\n\n### Comment ID jye7uj7 with +18 score by [(itsa_me_despression, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jye7uj7/) (in reply to ID jybc3rh):\nLmao they just totally skipped this because of course they did 🙄\n\n### Comment ID jybzr39 with +16 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybzr39/) (in reply to ID jybc3rh):\nI'd like to see these questions answered too\n\n### Comment ID jyeq3jn with +11 score by [(Poupetleguerrier, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jyeq3jn/) (in reply to ID jybc3rh):\nHow surprising to see they dodged that comment.\n\n### Comment ID jyf9406 with +6 score by [(Noneypoo, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jyf9406/) (in reply to ID jybc3rh):\nThese are such great questions!

This is important because, while I may not be able to see colors as others can, I still have opinions on them. I was gutted when I moved on to other color choices and those tooltips were gone. Literally the next choice (eye color I think?), nothing.\n\nCan you please add your color tooltips to ALL color choices?

In single player community sim games, it’s a common player progression arc that by the end of the game you’ve completely trivialized the core currency. As a live game, we believe we need to maintain the value of our core currencies over time, so we have set up our gold generation ecosystem to have limits.\n\nThat being said, we think there are some issues with the current execution of gardening.\n\n* Players have limited expression freedom with their gardens when they have to place them in 3x3 blocks and want to benefit from the adjacency crop buffs\n* Ability to really chase the fantasy of being a large scale farmer\n\nWe also know a lot of players are talking about how gardens only progress a single level while offline. This is a major economic consideration that would require major shifts to address, but we are looking into how we could best address this feedback.\n\nFrom what we are seeing, addressing these issues would require a significant amount of work we could do, but it would not be anything we would be able to address soon. - Forseti\n\n#### Comment ID jycbtcg with +46 score by [(zheph, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jycbtcg/) (in reply to ID jybya7i):\n> As a live game, we believe we need to maintain the value of our core currencies over time, so we have set up our gold generation ecosystem to have limits.\n\nThis is irrelevant to the game you've created.\n\nIn a game where there is a multiplayer economy, where people are buying and selling from each other, then people having access to effectively limitless gold becomes a problem because it creates inflation that makes things unaffordable for new players. \n\nThis is not a game with a multiplayer economy, and I don't see that ever changing because at that point \"cozy\" goes out the window. All buying and selling is done with NPCs. Another player, or even *every* other player having obscene amounts of gold has absolutely no impact on my gameplay.

Sure, we farm to our heart's content until we trivialize the in game currency, but guess what? We still sink hundreds and hundreds of hours into those games even after doing so.   \n\n\nA lot of us don't even farm for the money, but purely because we enjoy the *farming* itself.   \n\n\nYou already have a 300k perma-cap on gold with singular purchases that can range up to 33% of that cap (iron storage chests), excessively limited storage space even at full expansion, ***and*** a limit on crafting machines that make seeds and fertilizer. How badly could we really trivialize the core currency with these caps in place?

You can hit gold cap within one evening doing said cake parties. There was some guy on discord talking how he has earned, mostly from cake parties, 2million gold. \n\nAll the while there are other players struggling to even buy the 5k backpack. Because they don't do said cake parties or meta farming. \n\nIf I wasn't active on the discord. I wouldn't have learnt about meta farming. But even then, I have put in some serious time into the game to earn gold. To watch it get nerfed. All the while cake parties are fine. \n\nI'm honestly just confused about how that works. Makes me think you want people to group up. Which is fine, it's an MMO. But at the same time, it forces people to focus on cooking, if they want to really make gold. \n\nWhy aren't other activities buffed in the same way? Just the ability to be able to sell things we can make would be awesome. Atm I have an whole plot just filled with random furniture. Can't sell it. Can only give it to Tish.

Other MMOs care about this because there is a player economy and people with lots of currency contributes to inflation **but this is not the case with this game.** There is no inflation! One person having one million gold does not interact with my ability to have gold. This makes zero sense. One could argue making it more difficult to obtain gold keeps players in the game longer, but you know what else will make them quit?

We need more money to feel like we are making progress.\n\nIn a game with no trading system, does it really matter if one player has more income than another player?\n\nIf farm plots are unbounded, but each subsequent plot gets more expensive than the last, it will let us feel like we are investing our wealth.\n\n#### Comment ID jyk95rn with +2 score by [(Syralei, Reddit, 2023-08-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jyk95rn/) (in reply to ID jybya7i):\nSo we can't have larger farming plots and the tomato seed money making functionality has been nerfed, but cake parties are ok? When someone can easily make 40k/hour baking cakes? Make it make sense. That isn't a limit on gold production. That is limiting HOW people obtain gold. I want to be able to make money from farming as I enjoy that aspect of the game, and I can do other things in the game while waiting on my crops to grow and seeds to process. At a cake party, I'm standing at a station mixing stuff the whole time. Let me make gold however I want to if people are allowed to make 40-60k/hour baking cakes.

Our goal with balance changes to date have primarily been to address large outliers - this unfortunately comes with players feeling like their way of play is no longer viable. At the same time, we see some players feel like they have to participate in a certain activity, even if they don’t like doing that activity. This is the (literal) balancing act we’re playing with these changes. \n\nOne option might be to only buff everything that isn’t keeping up - the downside of that approach is a never ending inflation for all activities in the game.

So cake parties indeed ruined the fun for casual players... People always said there is no economy to destroy, so those parties making an insane amount of gold are not game-breaking. But now you tell us you're basing the prizes around those players?

Balance of gold should be around the majority of the casual player base to encourage play.  The current pricing of goods is out of reach for players who have little time to play, and is a big turn off in wanting to commit time to playing.\n\n#### Comment ID jyf9gty with +10 score by [(daemoness1215, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jyf9gty/) (in reply to ID jybt5lk):\nThank you for taking the time to respond and giving a thoughtful reply.

You only support players engaging in the content you want them to engage in .  This takes away player agency and forces a treadmill of activities that myself and many of my community do not enjoy and makes me sad.    \nI enjoy gardening but due to disability (TBI and Aphasia) other activities range from difficult to inaccessible for me.  I used to be a competitive gamer before and for a time lost the ability to even play games at all.  I know I'm not alone in this and hope the S6 team can come up with a better solution in the future.    \nI want to reiterate that I do love this game and wish it the best of success.

Make it make sense. You're literally contradicting all of the things being said about how you don't want people making too much gold. It's ok if it's cake parties but nothing else? This game has been in beta for one month. Newer players are already struggling to just get a $5k backpack expansion and can't afford any of the decor items at the market that aren't given out from the Chapaa chase, which is almost unplayable for many people. \n\nThis could have been a fun, inclusive event like a thank you to all of your beta players by letting them EARN one of each of the high cost fair decor items per quest, or lowering the costs to make them accessible to newer players and those who don't have access to groups to do cake parties with or unlimited time to grind out the over $150k all of the prizes would cost.\n\nI had two friends sign up recently because I told them there was going to be a market fair event.

This way we could make oatmilk. Oatmeal as well which could have variants like strawberry oatmeal, apple cinnamon, blue berry, peach, plain etc. Or you could make it Fruit Oatmeal with any fruit in the recipe.\n\nSo we'd need more fruits like Peaches, Strawberries, Lemons, Cinnamon, bananas, oranges, grapes, cherries, black berries, raspberries etc.\n\nI also think fruits should be separate from regular farmer or at least we should have cosmetic variants. That way we can have fruit trees and berry bushes as decorations. I was thinking maybe they could be functional props where you can gather from them once every few days but just decor would be good.\n\nVeggies like corn would be great for cornmeal, corn bread, corn dogs, creamy corn soup, grits (ground up corn), cheesy grits. Maybe finding some crops that would have many uses would be best. Rather than crops that'd only be good for one or two things. So, something like celery might not be a good priority. Oats, corn, most fruits, they have a lot of applications. Grapes could be used to make jam of course, but also juice or wine.\n\nA cooking method the game could have would be dehydration using a drying rack or whatever. To make jerky from meat and fish and fruit leather. It's take a long time like preserve jars, but maybe you get multiple pieces or it could provide more focus than just cooking it over the campfire. Like you get more use from it in exchange for it taking a long time compared to cooking it. It could also be used to dry out wood which could then result in sap, resin, and/or syrup or something would could be used for crafting furniture or cooking.\n\n#### Comment ID jyfd5nz with +1 score by [(Professional-Truth39, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jyfd5nz/) (in reply to ID jybov7y):\nI'm hoping since I saw what looked like a brewstand..and seeing honey I'm hoping for beer , wine, mead, sake, brandy, vodka, and various alcohol.

I think it would be so much more comfortable if you could go back to the workbench after crafting something.  \n\n\n\\- **Will you let us craft more ammo at a time than 20?**  \nGiven the fact, that after every thing we craft at the workbench, we have to go back, scroll down till we find what we crafted and then press craft *again*. Several times. I think it is *very* time consuming and it would be so much better, if you could let us craft more at a time, obviously consuming more materials.  \n\n\n\\- **Will there be added more ways to make your Palian more unique?**  \nSince Palia is only in the Beta, I don't think there is much to say yet but if so, will there be features for the body/face? Will players be able to change the nose shape or bodyweight? I think adding features like this will make the Palians look different from each other and add more diversity. Example: adding sliders or more color options for clothing and body.  \n\n\n\\- **Are more ways to make ingredients for food going to be possible?**  \nHarvesting is good! But will players be able to buy animals (Cows, Sheep etc.) for ingredients which can only be bought in Zeki's store? Could we maybe be able to hold chicken for egg, cows for milk and sheep/other animals at our plot for ingredients?  \n\n\n\\- **Will you be able to start a relationship with other Players in the future?**  \nThe romance system is really good but I think given the fact that not every NPC is romanceable I think adding the opportunity to date players would be a funny add on.

For example, the mini game rounding up the chapaas is fun, but it inherently puts the players in opposition to each other (ie, the more tickets others get, the less I get)\n\nAn alternative would be something like releasing 100 chapaas at once and the players have to round them up within a time limit. If the group gets all 100 within the time limit, everyone gets 50 tickets, if the group gets 90 of them everyone gets 45 tickets, etc. Maybe some kind of bonus to the top players.

And I had nearly all NPCs at 3+ relationship by the end of the first week. \n\nThe only reason I didnt cap out sooner is because I didnt understand the gifting situation soon enough and I got behind on relationship and couldnt finish the shepp quest. But by the end of the week I had little left to do, quest wise. \n\nI guess I just expected there to be more than like 15-20 hours of playtime content when the door opened.\n\n#### Comment ID jybgi7m with +25 score by [(Palia_Community, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybgi7m/) (in reply to ID jybfp01):\n**= Gold Cap =**\n\nQ: **Why is there a Gold cap? And why is it 300k?** If someone wants to have 1mil Gold, why shouldn't they be able to?\n\nThis is one of the challenges of blending the community sim genre and bringing multiplayer, always online components to the game. In most other community sim games that are offline, players' ability to acquire money grows exponentially, resulting in effectively unlimited currency, and removes any decision making around that friction point at some point in the game. At that point - I imagine most players stop playing and maybe restart (I know I do).   \n\n\nFor a live service game that we want to last for years on end - we felt it was important to maintain the value of our currencies over time. The gold cap is one method of keeping the overall economy in range. When we set the current gold cap amount - we based it on earlier Alpha test engagement and earning rates. What we’ve seen since Beta launch is how much both the median player and higher earning players are actually gaining - players are playing both longer and earning more gold than we anticipated with the 300k limit. This will be something that we continue to evaluate and make changes to.  \nWe’ll be going a lot more in depth on our economic thoughts in future dev update!  - Forseti  \n**= Cosmetics Questions =**\n\nQ: Additional clothing options are pay-walled at the moment - **will players at least be able to craft our own clothes in the near future?** On the topic of clothing, **will there be more FREE clothing options in the near future?** (either through crafting or simply added to the wardrobe in a patch)\n\nA: The free outfit options we currently have are what will be available for now. If we add more free clothing in the future, we expect that all players will be able to get them, and there won’t be craftable outfits. Keeping cosmetics paid is how we plan on supporting Palia financially, and until we learn a lot more about how that’s working we can’t commit to more free outfits. However, we do plan to release more character customizations for free, such as new hairstyles, new skin tones, and facial hair. - WizardCrab\n\nQ: **Will there be more body types added to the character customization?**\n\nA: Increasing the available options in character customization is a huge priority for us. Some additional options like facial hair have a pretty clear path to deliver an end product players will be happy with, while others like body types are a lot more complex - both on the technical side and for art execution. We’re working toward a number of expansions to the character customization system and body types are extremely high on that list, but will take us some time to get right. - Eggo\n\n**=Housing Questions=**\n\nQ: **Will players ever be able to sell and/or salvage furniture items?**\n\nA: We know this is a top player request and we’re still discussing what the right solution is here for Palia, so we don’t have a concrete answer at this time. It’s not a super fun answer, but it’s the truth, so look forward to future updates on this topic. - Aidan\n\nQ: **Will the map be updated with a grid system for more efficient node call outs?** *(i.e \"Proudhorn seen at C12\")*\n\nA: Yes! A system like this is something that we’re looking into and hope to have that in the near future. - Eris\n\n**=Lore=**\n\nQ: **Are there plans to make NPCs more dynamic and \"alive\"?** (ie. giving them idle animations, have them interact with each other, etc.)\n\nA: This is a topic that comes up a lot, and we hope to have an update on that soon. Our animators are working on a lot of priorities – from future cutscenes to bespoke dialogue animations – but additional idle behaviors are on the list. We are also actively investigating NPCs interacting with the environment, which could eventually lead to them interacting with each other. - EmbrasAshes\n\nQ: **ETA: Will Romance-able NPCs serve more of purpose in the future?** (ie. Marriage, relationship perks/bonuses, etc.\n\nA: We will likely not offer gameplay perks and bonuses for romance, because we feel like players should engage in romance because they like a character not because they are trying to get a bonus. That being said, we are planning on adding additional romance levels that would include new content and features. A “marriage” or “move in” state is being discussed as part of those plans. - EmbrasAshes\n\n#### Comment ID jyca2vm with +3 score by [(Basjaa, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jyca2vm/) (in reply to ID jybfp01):\nWe only have 1 out of 4 collection slots available on the main quest door.

Free players should be able to have unique and cool outfits too, that are unlockable through quests or earned through skills. Even craftable--Maybe Jel could have a Tailor's guild just like how the rest of the skills do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am someone who appreciates the fact that they made the game free, and I HAVE spent $30 to purchase unique outfits, but the option to not look bland and boring shouldn't be locked behind a paywall.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe free cosmetics look like a lot, until you realize it's really not, and there are very limited ways to customize your character. Not enough color choices, no ability to change accent colors, etc. The outfits aren't BAD, but you can tell that they're not great either with the purpose of making you want to spend money to not look boring.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the very least, maybe it should be possible to earn Palia coins somehow by accomplishing certain feats in-game.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I have seen the other questions regarding this that have been asked, and unfortunately it looks like there won't be any more free cosmetics any time soon, for monetization purposes. It's a shame. I understand that it being a free game means they need to make money somehow, but I just don't like the way that they're going about it.\n\n#### Comment ID jybjz7n with +15 score by [(mightbedylan, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybjz7n/) (in reply to ID jybjhvg):\nI REALLY hope we get Tailoring as a skill.

We do think there *are* instances where some of those customizations can be flashy cosmetic bonuses and it’s totally okay for both of those spaces to coexist.

I hope you are all doing well!\n\nI have a question to WizardCrab. (nice name btw)\n\nOn February 16, a blogpost was release about the monetisation of the game. It stated that you dont want to monetize through tricks. It was a very noble statement when we know how AAA studio psychologically manipulate players to spend more money.\n\nMy question is: Why a Premium Coin system? Why not directly purchasable item?\n\nMy feeling as a player is that Palia's cashshop is not better than your competition. I really understand that it can help you funding the development of the game, but it really left a bad impression after the ealier monetisation statement.\n\nIf the current system is to be kept, will be there a way in the future to be able to spend every coin that the player have purchase?\n\nThanks for your answer on the matters!\n\nI wish Palia's team the best!

If outfits were purchased for real money instead of Palia Coins, we would be limited in how many outfits we could offer, we would have minimal options in how we could provide discounts, you might not be able to use your outfits across all platforms, and a ton of other limitations.\n\nI know it’s weird to talk about the realities of business, but this is why we essentially have to use premium currency in Palia.\n\nAs for spending all of your Coins, the changes we made to the store today (plus the Palia Coins we gave out) hopefully make this a lot better, where Palia Coin packages generally match our outfit prices. It’s not perfect but it’s as close as possible. - WizardCrab\n\n#### Comment ID jybl126 with +48 score by [(RelikaNox, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybl126/) (in reply to ID jybjsnk):\nIs there a reason that other MMOs that are cross-platform, such as Final Fantasy XIV, still manage to allow us to buy microtransactions with normal currency and not middleman coins, as well as provide regular discounts as is?

And why you've decided to not have any free alternatives?\n\nA: I can, but I know it won’t be a very satisfying explanation to many of you. We actually had the plan to give a prototype of pets (ie Palcats) to early purchasers for a very long time - since even before a single player ever logged into Palia (and well before the project was even called Palia FWIW). A version of it was actually originally slated for our first Alpha test but we cut it to work on some critical systems that had fallen behind and needed priority. The long and short of it is that it is a thank you to people willing to purchase early, but I want to be upfront that it’s also an important purchase incentive. We think that for a new game it’s really important that the first purchases people make are overloaded with value, and pets were our best option. - WizardCrab\n\nQ: Currently the game is sparse with things that actually reward cooperation. Things like Palium ore and flow trees often lead to strife and competiveness. Can you expand on upcoming co-op features for Palia? Things like just >sitting< in the inn with your friends and playing a card game would add so much to Palia.\n\nA: Areas in which gathering experiences are leading to strife we’d generally consider to not be meeting our goals for a collaborative multiplayer experience. So expect us to continue to iterate and try new things in these spaces.\n\nIn terms of additional co-op features, some of the things we’re able to speak to at this time include being able to more closely share a plot with a friend, activities you can complete with your community, and we're assessing additions to many of our skills that will reward or require co-op to participate.\n\nWe’ve recently announced that we’re working on a variety of decor interactivity options, including sitting in chairs, which will unlock the first part of your cozy inn fantasy. Family board game nights are also super cozy to so many people around the world. So we’re fans of your line of thinking here. - Aidan\n\n## Comment ID jybed37 with +17 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybed37/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID jyfwid1 with +2 score by [(CthulhuLovesMemes, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jyfwid1/) (in reply to ID jybed37):\nI want weather so bad!

More specifically, could you shed some light on how they work? Are there only a set amount of flow trees that can spawn in a server at a time? Or does every tree just have a percentage rate of being a flow tree on respawn? Like, theoretically, could we chop every tree until it's just a forest of flow trees?    \n\n\nSecond, we've all seen the adorable ormuus at the family farm. Are there any plans to introduce Ranching for animal products? I'm sure we would all love barns and ormuus and chickens of our own, plus an alternative way to get milk and eggs. I could also see that opening up the possibility of a processor to turn those milks and eggs into cheese, butter, maybe even mayo for new recipes.    \n\n\nAnd lastly, are there any plans to add marriage into our NPC relationships?

When we see one activity start to be notably better than others, it creates a pressure on a lot of players to start doing that activity or they will feel like they're being left behind.On the tomato seed front, we started to see those pop up as a high income generating item and that led us to investigate why, and in that investigation we realized that the timer was set incorrectly in the game. The rate that players started to sell tomato seeds over other seeds was a signal for us to investigate. That investigation exposed an error that simply made tomatoes the only crop you should be planting if you're trying to make money.\n\nCake parties on the other hand are awesome and an activity we very much want to preserve, but they are generating too much income right now. We intentionally designed cooking around being a multiplayer activity, and wanted to encourage players to play in ways like this. Given the high cost to organize a cake party, we think it’s ok for this to be one of the best, if not the best value generating activity in the game. We’re discussing options to bring the income earned down while preserving the overall benefit of this activity and will share when we have a path forward. Long term, the better solution is adding more dishes of this complexity to ensure players aren’t just making celebration cakes at these parties, but other dishes and multiplayer activities as well. - Forseti\n\n#### Comment ID jybp827 with +18 score by [(theadverbnoun, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybp827/) (in reply to ID jybicst):\nThank you for this answer, Forseti. I do want to say though that the only real block I've found in progressing through the story is actually gold. I never have enough to buy all the \"Fine\" tool recipes and such, much less to expand my house the way I want. And without those better tools, I have trouble with certain quests--take, for example, the difficulty of catching a Void Ray with the Standard Rod, which I need to pass the first Night Sky bundle.\n\nAdmittedly, I was one of the people who made mad money off of tomatoes--I thought the pricing/timer was intentional, though. There aren't nearly enough ways to make gold in the game given how reliant the story is on gold, and so it bothers me that tomatoes were nerfed without providing another option. Especially since this update included a fresh gold sink in the form of wildly expensive Maji Market items.\n\n#### Comment ID jybkol1 with +35 score by [(Risvixyn, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybkol1/) (in reply to ID jybicst):\nWhy not buff other ways to make money rather than continuously nerfing ways the community finds to earn it? Everything costs SO much (60k for a maji plushi?!) it doesn't feel like there are any ways to earn the income without spending 24/7 on the game UNLESS you do cake parties.

Not everyone has the time or honestly the mental capacity that those take. I like logging on and watering my tomatoes and being chill and cozy, having to go to a huge party where there’s a list of rules to follow, roles assigned, pressure to cook the right things, and on top of that needing to either organize it or find one that has an open slot with items that you are able to provide. It’s great for those who want to do it, but now the pressure that you were referring too is increased ten fold to do the only alternative you’ve left. \n\n3) If the issue you found was the timer was wrong, then why would the solution be to DECREASE the timer and cost an additional tomato rather than just increase the timer. It seems there was never an error in the first place if that was the solution and the timer was an excuse to nerf the seed profits with cause, making it seem like it was always supposed to be that way.\n\n4) The money was honestly such a non issue, so I don’t get why it needs nerfing in the first place. There are so many things to do and buy, especially if events are going to have limited time items, that being able to afford the things is motivating to keep playing and saving for the things you want to buy or the vision you have for your house. Having earnings nerfed for anything and taking longer and longer to buy the things that get more and more expensive is very demotivating to continue gameplay. \n\nHope this input helps as I’d love to continue the gameplay I was enjoying!\n\n#### Comment ID jybofp7 with +40 score by [(LeftFeature404, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybofp7/) (in reply to ID jybicst):\nI dont think yall realize not everyone is a social butterfly who is comfortable playing in big groups to cook.

Thats bad gameplay design. If you're going to have that, you really need to look into making the other gameplay loops just as profitable (or at least close to similar) and encourage people to group up for those. Why group up to hunt when you can make say 10k-20k when you could just default to the cake party and make 100k.\n\n  \n\nNerfing tomatoes for that reason, but allowing only one profession to make high end money like that just makes no sense. Hope this gets addressed sooner than later. I know a lot of my friends are already talking about quitting the game based on the responses they've seen here today as well as past issues that have arose, such as terrible communication with game breaking bugs that prevented a ton of people from progressing in certain things, yet rushing to fix a cosmetic bug that allowed players to \"equip a pet\" temporarily.  \n\n  \n\nI know there is a decent amount of ex-blizz employees working here, but it sure seems like they are bringing the bad aspects of Blizz to this game, and it shows every time you look around.\n\n#### Comment ID jyc2kzc with +4 score by [(rosedragoness, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jyc2kzc/) (in reply to ID jybicst):\nHello devs! My IGN is rosedragon and I held cooking parties since close beta. I have my own spreadsheets and held parties through my friend's discord, and while I get to realizes cake is where the money at, I was intimidated at first with how many players it need. Eventually, people get used to cooking together and dare to do cake parties with me (and eventually others after LFG revamp) but I do also aware that some of my community members shrunk from these too-big group. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think S6 should consider lifting up activities that people are less interested instead nerfing things that work. Tomato seeds profit ain't that big, either the sernuk hunting. I get the idea you want people to work together, but there are a lot of people that play MMO solo and only interested in small gathering with their close friends. Sadly, I have no good idea on how to make other activities than cooking more attractive to do together, but I think I have idea for cooking. Money wise: to my calculation.. you can get 70-100k per hour with cake party (15 people), 40k per hour with apple pie party (6 people), but barely anything for recipes that only have 3-4 people. How about.. keep the cake, up pies to 60k/hour, and have at least one 3-4 people recipe gives 40k/hour? Diversity wise: How about adjusting it so there is food best for cooking for focus and reduce the focus gained from foods that best for coins? I tried making focus food before, but on end game it seems pickles solve all my focus problems. How about adding more buffs? Food that reduce tools damage, food that increase movement speed, increase bug catching %, and so on just like how Palia did for fishing? \n\nThanks!\n\n#### Comment ID jycuk2s with +3 score by [(HenryLoenwind, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jycuk2s/) (in reply to ID jybicst):\nDon't attribute one féffect to a random cause when there are other differences that could cause it. My decision to plant tomatoes was based solely on the fact that they need the least amount of re-planting (a very annoying step), not on doing any kind of math regarding the yield.\n\nAside from a very visible but also very small group that goes into great detail in investigating and calculating through every detail of the game, next to nobody would have been aware that tomatoes had a higher gold yield than other produce, but everyone who has ever planted them knows that they can be harvested multiple times per planting.\n\nWhen reading Discord, one thing that pops up regularly when people post their optimised farm layouts is \"I gave up on puzzling out farming layouts and just put down tomatoes because it's so much simpler\". A clear sign that people chose tomatoes for their simplicity and lower time investment, not their higher yield.\n\nAs such, I feel the proper fix would have been to adjust the tomato seed sell price to reflect that they only take 2 tomatoes to produce, not to reduce the amount of tomatoes any plant yields (by increasing the amount of tomatoes that go into replanting).\n\n#### Comment ID jyhaokv with +3 score by [(RandoGamerGuy, Reddit, 2023-08-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jyhaokv/) (in reply to ID jybicst):\nYou have already started to foster a community of toxicity and exclusivity. I have observed and experienced this numerous times myself when spending time in Bahari looking for Palium nodes and Flow trees. Only a small percentage of players seem to care about helping out other strangers in your envisioned \"work together\" gameplay style. There is more often a single player, or established group that often plays together, that goes around and harvests these materials for themselves. In one instance, a player with a palium pickaxe was **racing** me to palium nodes and destroying them before I could reach them. All it required was for them to give me a few seconds of their time to make one single hit in the collaborative spirit I thought Palia was aiming to be.  \nYour opinion on cake parties and \"wanted to encourage players to play in ways like this\" is just adding to the same problem. These groups of people are people that play together regularly and bring that \"pack\" mentality to the rest of the game.  \nInitially I was thrilled to anticipate a game where random strangers can contribute towards a common goal, but it has very quickly become apparent that Palia will never be that way.  \nIt will be selfish solo\\\\pack players that get some sense of gratification from taking away from the \"new\\\\weak\" players because it gives them a sense of superiority.  \nI am not trying to generalize and include EVERYONE that partakes in cake parties, but it is very clear that people that play together frequently, will usually consider their own pack above anyone\\\\everyone else.  \nYour community consists of pockets of players that are COMPETING, not collaborating and they are destroying the experience for those of us that were dreaming of a cozy, relaxing, collaborative experience.  \nThe idea is a grand and great one, it was just implemented poorly.  \nI will probably stick around a bit longer, but boy am I glad I didn't spend the money I was burning to spend when I initially started playing the game.

Can crafting station be reworked so that we don’t need to craft multiple crafters and instead, crafting licenses will allow you to add a new slot. Example: Seed Maker have a default of one slot. Crafting License will increase to 2 slots and so on.\n\n4. Why don’t the game have cutscene for many of the friendship/romance event.

There's also a gold cap in place, a limit on 9 soil plots, and the inability to really kind of interact with your space besides plunking things down on it. So I'm curious what the devs envision as ideal player interaction with their environment and the community when said milestones have been reached -- what keeps the players logging in after bumping into the various soft limits? \n\n2) Are there any plans to introduce more long-term focused achievements or milestones?\n\nFor example, FFXIV has achievements such as mining 100, 300, 1000, 5k, 10k high quality items, which exist as aspirational content, alongside more attainable achievements such as 1k - 3k normal quality items from within a specific zone or something (similar to what you've got atm). The super long term ones help make it feel like you're not wasting progression, while also not compelling participation, since they don't reward anything fancy beyond a title.\n\n3) Why nerf tomatos but not cake parties?

Will you ever do tihngs in more European friendly hours? It's 3am and we would get to miss out asking questions because of this.\n2.

I have two questions which are somewhat related.\n\n1) I would like clarification from a statement in the February 16 blog post:\n\n> There’s a corollary of this that we want to be upfront about: **if you can’t buy the things you earn, it also means you won’t be able to earn the things you can buy.** Ultimately, we believe that by separating these systems, we can ensure that we’re always designing what’s best for gameplay while selling products that are worth purchasing for what they are. We believe this is the right balance to make the best game experience we can. \n\nI do believe it is fair that furniture we can currently craft is not something sold in the shop. And costumes currently in the shop, and the cats, are not available to earn in the game as they are currently.\n\nThe clarification I would like is if this means that all costumes will **always** be a monetary purchase, all pets will **always** be a monetary purchase, and all furniture will **always** be earned in game. That you will never present a mix. Such as furniture sets sold in the shop, and clothes/pets earned in the game.\n\n2) Also you offer a coin package of 425 coins. Will there ever be anything that can be purchased for 425 without purchasing a more expensive item first (such as the first item in a bundle for 850 coins?)\n\nThank you\n\n## Comment ID jybd6mm with +6 score by [(theadverbnoun, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybd6mm/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nHi team!!

I love a lot of the PARTS of some of these costumes, but seeing as they're bogged down to hat/shirt/pants, I don't really feel the need to even consider buying any of them. If I'm going to put money into cosmetics for a game, I need more mix-matching than 3 categories. If I could change out gloves and shoes, just as two decently easy examples, that's already made the outfit system 10 times more flexible. There's also some back items, such as the backpacks on the farmer bundle, the lute on the bard, the jetpack on the steampunk bundle... that could easily be clipped into their own models for even more customization. It would take a bit of effort, but the payoff would be phenomenal, and it'd definitely be easier to do now, while there's still not a ton of cosmetics in the game, and it would further expand possibilities in the future.\n\n## Comment ID jybiq84 with +5 score by [(Torkoro, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybiq84/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nThank you for amazing game, but I have questions regarding current game status and roadmap\n\nCurrent game status:\n1.

This game is absolutely everything I need in my life. It gives me a very much needed break from the monumental amount of stress work places on me. I can literally just submerse myself in the world of Palia and learning about the lore and characters has been an amazing feature within this game.

You guys/gals/theys have a beautiful product in the works and I am more than eager/excited to see where this game takes us. There’s still so much we don’t know about the world.

If anyone wants to pull off a particular question and reuse it as a dedicated question feel free.\n\n***The Questions that are really harsh***\n\n* Why do we have ABSOLUTELY NO accessibility options. Like absolutely 0? This seems incredibly sad that the team has no cares for people  with disabilities. Trying to figure out uncommon fish - can’t because color blind settings don’t exist. Have a hard time with H/E coordination - too bad you won’t be cooking. Have issues with holding click - too bad you won’t be fishing. The list goes on….\n\n* The new event is not co-op, or player friendly, and is leading to a ton of griefing - thoughts?\n\n* Will we be getting more farming space anytime soon? \n\n* Why was no compensation given for the whole uhh situation lately(crazy extended downtime, lack of communication, the whole plot stealing, etc)\n\n* What is the thought process to adding pets (a huge component to ‘cozy’ games) and locking it behind a pay wall?\n\n* The new event stamp card is essentially a battle pass, with FOMO all over it - wasn’t this completely against what you guys said was no fomo?\n\n* Why are Palia coins even a thing, if not to be deceitful, allow direct purchases of cosmetics.\n\n* Will you be hiring any additional support staff to answer tickets - I have multiple going on two weeks old\n\n* What payment or PII are you storing when we make a purchase through stripe - your support team has directly accessed users payment methods and that should not be possible.\n\n***MMO Questions***\n\n* Can you clarify when we will be getting more mmo like features?\n\n* Community features of any kind? shared plots, etc\n\n* Raising the server size to something substantial?\n\n* Ability to select server number directly rather then randomly \n\n* Any outlook on allowing us to spin up private maps so our community only can be in Bahari?\n\n***Game Balance questions***\n\n* What is the thought process to nerfing what players are finding fun(hunting previously, now with cakes)? \n\n* Currently using the best method of gold farming it will take over 1,000 hours to get the 100,000,000 gold achievement - that’s a little over the top : don’t you think? \n\n* Why has the design philosophy been nerfs to ‘overpowered things’ and not buffing others? Such as mining for ore being substantially worse then hunting.\n\n* Will we get a buff to spawn rate of deer in the town map? \n\n* When will we get a balance patch to make upgrading all the tools actually worth it?\n\n* When will we get a solo friendly way of obtaining flow tree wood\n\nCommunity Engagement Questions:\n\n* When will we see the mods on the Discord server being held to the same standard for everyone - the amount of bans handed out for weird infractions does not make sense.\n\n* Why did the entire community team disappear and go radio silent after the last patch - is that the type of engagement we will have after ‘bad’ patches? \n\n* When will the community team start using Reddit, Facebook or/and Twitter ; rather then ONLY Discord to push important communication.\n\n@EmbrasAshes - thank you for what you did within your role ; it’s the one part of the game that has no issues and you should feel super proud!\n\n@Fabcypants could you care to explain what happened that made the 2 hour maitenance a 8 hour maintenance and what you’ll be doing to ensure this doesn’t happen moving toward \n\n@Wizardcrab not giving out a free cat and charging for skins is a super bad decision and I hope whoever decided that gets absolutely reprimanded.

As it stands I *can* read it, it just takes me a little longer. \n\nWhat’s been your favorite thing about the community for this game that you didn’t expect?\n\n## Comment ID jybij72 with +6 score by [(Toulow, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybij72/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nAs someone who only really plays games for their end game content, What are your plans for that? \n\nPersonaly, I enjoy the grind and farming to get my skills leveled up and get gold, but, there has to be something else right? I have 7 plots and only 2 of them are used 1 for my main house and the second is a big kitchen. I have 0 content. Im enjoying the event, but after that, im back to just cutting tree's and fishing. Im aware I play the game a LOT more than the average player, but I'd just like to see something to reach for.  \n\n\nWill we ever see full plots of farm land? or are you going to keep the cap at 9? Are we going to get a plot of apple trees? meaning I can just place them down like all the other trees in Palia, collect the apples from them and then cut them down when I dont want them?  \n\n\nAnd a big question. Replayable quests. Fairly similar to my first question. I would LOVE to see some replayable quests like in WoW. Even if its 1 weekly and 1 daily from each of the factions. Have Badruu give us X amount of gold for \"picking up the slack\" for him and bringing him some crops.   \n\n\n\\- Truely love the game and cant wait to see where it goes!\n\n## Comment ID jybj7wp with +6 score by [(mizyin, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybj7wp/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nHey folks! I'm here with two questions that I have seen a lot of rustling about but not brought up in here (unless I missed em!)\n\n1) we need duplicate cooking stations to have a fully functional kitchen, and I don't mind that, I understand the rationale behind it! But none of the cooking stations mesh very well with each other or with the rest of the furniture. Is there any possibility of being able to customize these so that they match better with other sets, or at least match better with each other? It's very hard to make a nice looking kitchen at the moment!\n\n2) there have been a lot of complaints about finding the rare fish, whether they are needed for the bundles or not. I know people have completed it without issue, but I have seen people talking about spending thousands of worms to get a specific fish, with absolutely zero way to influence your luck one way or the other. I have fished in a lot of video games, it's one of my favorite pastimes to do in a video game, and used to be one of my favorite pastimes in real life too! this is one of the only games that puts this much emphasis on fishing that I've seen that doesn't also give you some way to influence whe\nther or not you're actually going to get the fish you want?\n\nEven in ones with very relaxed fishing, like animal crossing, you can use things like fish bait to draw fish to a specific area and then try to spy the size to see if it's the fish you want, being able to cast specifically for the size of this you want. With this game it's just cast and wait, and even if you cheese it a little bit by not reeling it in when it's not the fish you want, it can be hours or even days or weeks before you get the thing you want. What's the rationale behind this, is it truly just a way to have a natural time gate? Is this something that has been discussed in terms of changing in the future, and if not, are people catching these rare fish like the unicorn and void ray at the speed you are expecting? Is the 1000 or more worms thing out of the norm or what you would expect?\n\n## Comment ID jyblfz1 with +6 score by [(ZWiloh, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jyblfz1/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\n1. Are there any plans to add ways to get non-produce cooking ingredients ourselves? Like milk and eggs would require keeping animals, or cooking oil could be produced by the player. \n\n2. Would it be possible to add a little freedom to the pets where instead of following us they could wander free on our home plot? \n\n3. I'm very interested in hairstyles as a way of self expression, are customization options besides addition of beards in the works? Would you be willing to consider a design contest at some point for players to submit hair (or even clothing) suggestions? \n\n4.

The problem with Palium is that it's scarce. The problem with flow trees is that there isn't an easy way to direct players to them. Players in this game bend toward co-operative play more often than competitive, so our community seems to have the reasonable expectation that the game is a co-op experience even if some mechanics are currently hostile due to lacking QoL or design flaws.\n\nChapaa Chase is designed to be hostile though, which is so antithetical to the game's design that I cannot imagine what conversation went on in a board meeting to possibly justify its existence to the lead designer...\n\n## Comment ID jybr92s with +5 score by [(Gl4dios, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybr92s/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nwhy are we not getting any more renown for talking to NPC as soon as we hit max friendship? i have literally no incentive to talk to any of them anymore after im hitting Level 4 friendship/relationship\n\n## Comment ID jycbp57 with +5 score by [(9Ld659r, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jycbp57/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nThank you guys for doing the AMA.

I literally saw someone saying they were going to report another player for not sharing.\n\nThe fact is, is that there will always be more resources, and you should have gotten there first if it bugs you that badly.\n\nNow if a player is close by to you, it's rude if you don't wait for them, and the same goes for if players are doing call-outs and you just run up and break the resource without waiting. I do agree that that is rude.\n\nBut simply not sharing doesn't make someone a horrible person--not everyone has the time to spend waiting for 5-6 players on the other side of the map picking up every resource on the way there.\n\n## Comment ID jybafd5 with +8 score by [(ezramannon, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybafd5/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nI would love to hear more about your (all y’all) original vision for the game and whether the game is still on that path.

So I'll start with some simple ones:\n\n1.Are you aware of the increasing frustration and anger towards the game?Ever since the \"pets\" were introduced, and now with the aggressive PVP minigame from the maji market, people have been getting angrier and angrier, and leaving the game. Why were people's questions and feedback never answered? Are we going to have ANY free pets that aren't just a pointless cosmetic that does nothing and stays out of your camera 90% of the time? Is the chaapa chase game going to be fixed to be fair to players or are we going to continue stealing and fighting each others? Because that's already caused a ton of toxicity and hate.\n\n2. Why is something like a plushie worth MORE than my bloody home? that makes no sense! A house expansion is cheaper than some of the fair food!And no, thats not to say \"make expansions pricier\" good god no, thats just going to make people hate the game even more. its to say lower the pricessssss. its bad enough its a timed event that already doesn't have as many days as promised!The economy of the game is extremely unbalanced, too expensive overall, and frustrating.It promotes stressfull non stop grinding, the OPPOSITE of a cozy mmo.Also constantly nerfing the ways people find to even make a scratch of money is raising the anger higher. Whats the point anymore?\n\n3. resources are too few, too competitive. People will literally mine or chop wood resources in front of people who are waiting for others to share it with and run off with them. this has caused name calling, lots of blocking, stealing, camping, and struggling with finding resources. What are you doing to fix this?\n\n4. why do we have so much plot of land, when we get only 9 plots to farm with? why? just...why?! for a farming game, there sure is a very limited amaunt of farming. it feels more like a side gig I run while I have to do everything else to even ATTEMPT to make some money.\n\n5. what are you doing about the furniture career? its at a huge disavantage compared to the other skills just because we can't sell our hard work. it clutters our inventory, we can't used them.  There is no sorting system for furniture at all, which is a pain. half of it can't be placed right, about 50% don't match their icons on the list, none of it is functional and even painting some of them makes no difference at all. so what are the plans to change this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n6. can we have an actual gardening career rather than just farming?

Why do you keep nerfing ways people are earning gold?**\n\nSpecifically, I'm talking about the things which caused me (and a couple of my friends) to stop playing:  Fishing's nerf (we all noticed that it became harder/more stressful to catch fish), the decrease oysters/shell spawns, and if possible the spawn rate nerf which led to people competing for sernuk?\n\nSome people seem to be having no issues earning gold, but I always felt like it took forever for me to earn enough to get the unlocked recipes for leveling up (and many of them are still waiting on being bought because I couldn't afford them).  Why not just let people play at their own pace and let them earn gold how they want without constantly nerfing it?\n\n**2)  Do you think you'll ever be able to solve/fix the issue with the housing plots?**\n\nI noticed that, even after the hotfix, people are still reporting that at least their crops are being stolen.  ~~Since crops are one of the biggest money makers~~, the security of the homestead is a big concern of mine.\n\nThank you for your time!\n\nEdit:  Added a second part to my first question after reading that tomato seeds got nerfed today.\n\n## Comment ID jybabwy with +3 score by [(TheMetalAlmanach, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybabwy/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nHi guys , thanks for a great game.

To me it seems that balancing resources in an open world is a difficult task while trying to maintain “cozy” feel. I was slightly disappointed to find the lack of system depth in the economy, and maybe thinking that you’ve sacrificed system depth to avoid intense economy balancing. \n\nSo My question — what is your current thought process regarding maintaining a resource-based economy (and core gameplay loop) in a multiplayer environment?\n\nFollow up question — does it have anything to do with Palia being client authoritative? Also, why is Palia client authoritative?\n\n## Comment ID jybpxtt with +3 score by [(ThatVanguard, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybpxtt/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nIs there any chance for adding instruments?

A decent statement on its face. However we’re only seeing things you can BUY and nothing you can EARN. No outfits, no cosmetics. When will the “you can’t buy things you can earn” part of your statement become a reality?\n\nTo the community team: When can we expect the moderation team to enforce rules the same for everyone instead of just muting/kicking/banning people they dislike and only taking action against certain users if they are reported on via ModMail? Even though they’re apparently ‘watching’? At what point can we expect them to be proactive about their jobs?\n\nWhat is the OFFICIAL stance on bigotry? We never received one, just “the story so far.” And why have you taken a harder stance on AI art than you have bigotry? Isn’t this an “inclusive” company making an “inclusive” game?\n\nFinally, what about Palia in its current state is worth a player’s time and money?

My questions reflect a few others that have been asked;\n\nWhat is your target audience/market for this game? It seems to be geared towards younger adults instead of \"everybody\", as evident by the lack of romance options for those of us above thirty.\n\nHow will the Switch release effect the PC players? Decor limits? Building limits? With a previous game I played that had similar housing features, the building aspect was severely limited due to consoles having less computing power than a computer, which dampened the pc players overall enjoyment.\n\nOne last question regarding the lack of language editing in your game...do you have an employee specifically tasked to review and proofread your content before release? From what I see users in the Discord server are encouraged to post pictures of editing mistakes, essentially doing this job for the company, which seems odd.\n\nEdit: Okay, and one more question...do you plan on having Palia merch for sale? The proceeds may help to financially support the game as well, along with real life plushies, and such things. (I'd love a t-shirt.)\n\n## Comment ID jybllh8 with +2 score by [(sensual_turtleneck, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybllh8/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nWhat are your goals for accessibility for disabled players?\n\n## Comment ID jybluul with +2 score by [(Ana-Moli, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybluul/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nI expect some of what I’ll ask may have an answer I haven’t found yet. My preemptive apologies for those. Here goes:\n\nWill you be adding the ability to craft/sell/purchase multiples? \n\nCan we please ant bushes and trees on our plot and not take up valuable crop real estate?\n\nPlease stop nerfing how we make money. You mention the top 10% of players earning coin at an exponential rate. Hurrah for them, truly. I am a mom of two and have a career that takes up the vast majority of my time, but I still want to buy nice things and have nice gear for my nice, big house. Hunting Sernuk was something I could do while I waited for crops to grow. I understand that you want some element of complexity, I even respect that, but for the truly casual player this was a hit. \n\nGlow worms: For the love of my sanity, please, please can you make the output just a smidge higher. Again, people like me do not have time to grind for everything the way some others do, but I’d really like to knock out my bundles and find cool fishies. \n\nCould we have an option to turn on an audible alert for whispers, party, and community chat?\n\nWhy do I need to have multiples of each crafting station? Why can’t I just upgrade it to work faster and produce more and better materials? I don’t want to clutter my beautiful home area with a bunch of stations.\n\nPlot: Commenting solely for support of other’s recommendations, could we please have more options to decorate?\n\nLastly, mounts… a bike, a skateboard, hovercraft? Please… omg please. Wait, one more… why do we have to pay to fast travel!??! \n\nWith all of that said, I’ve been a long for the ride since alpha and I have to say I am so very pleased with the progress I’ve seen. I know this is a monumental undertaking, and I see it is a labor of love. Thank you for everything you’re doing. Palia is cozy, warm, and fun.

Some sets have a lot of furniture types that cover a lot of bases while others are severely lacking.  Mixing and matching sets doesn't work to well at the moment since a lot of furniture clashes even with the limited dyeing from the modification sets.\n\nI'm aware that some furniture sets have pieces on the Black Market, but there still missing parts from them all.  For example, the Ravenwood set has a Wardrobe and no dresser.  I do not feel the two items cover the same thing when it comes to designing a room since more bedrooms have a closet and a dresser.  \n\nSimply put, some sets are lacking and I wonder if there are plans to add more to existing furniture sets?\n\nAdditionally, are there plans for more outdoor foliage like bushes, large flower beds, and stone or wood paths?\n\n## Comment ID jybn1th with +2 score by [(gdihq, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybn1th/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nFinding out that flow usage isn't technically illegal for humans was kind of an \"Ah ha!\" moment.

I don't have a question but I would like to make a statement. I'm the exact target demographic for this MMO, and so are my friends. In fact I referred 5 of them. \n\nI think this game shouldn't be an MMO. Players compete for resources, griefers use cheat engine of all things to *steal furniture* (is your DB admin/admin?), and nobody really seems interested in talking or interacting at all. In fact I haven't really seen any benefit to this being an MMO. Cozy, lite, or otherwise.\n\nAnd as much as I'd like to support your game, I'm not paying $20 or more for *one color* of *one* outfit. I'm also not going to buy a pet. The optics of the first new feature being added to the game, being a strictly paid cosmetic, isn't great. \n\nI've paid $100 for Disney Dreamlight Valley and I've paid $145 for Animal Crossing: NH (2x game copies, and 1 DLC). I've also bought Stardew Valley twice. The difference is that these games are single-player, playable offline, and don't charge egregious amounts for very limited cosmetics. They've also implemented some pretty significant gameplay features before asking for more money. **T****he total that I'm going to spend on Palia in its current form is $0.** \n\nI'd love to change that if down the line some priorities and decisions are reevaluated and a more feature-complete version of the game is packaged and sold as a standalone, offline, but optional co-op experience. As it is I can't in good faith support this game, both because of the priorities and choices so far, and IMO the very real risk that it does not have a fair, firm monetization model that will be able to support its continued operation.\n\n## Comment ID jyba4wm with +4 score by [(Econecroz, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jyba4wm/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nHello, i have a few questions, silly ones:\n\nWhen are you going to add a feature to login screen when we can use TAB to switch between mail and password?\n\nWill be parties be useful in the future?

My question is in regards to lore and information. I know this is meant to be a long term story tell however while we got to know some customs and a little about the town but we have accepted a shepp and know so little about the races that inhabit our new home. Are there plans to teach us in a way about what happened to old humans, how did Kilma come to be what planet are we are, what is the history of all its people and so on. I think it would help with connection to the town and help it feel more like home.

The community has been fantastic and there is a lot of content for a free to play open beta. Bravo to the entire team from top to bottom. The engagement seen in discord and through dev blogs or responses is incredibly refreshing to see, and the attention to prioritizing quality of life from feedback has been noticed. \n\nIt's hard to weed through the negativity these days but the game is such a welcomed break and you can tell there is a lot of heart put into the characters and stories so far. There are constant hints at more stories to tell regarding the Dutchess, Human origins/events, etc and I'm incredibly excited to see where things go. We have already seen quite a bit of content added to the game since the start of closed beta, and even today with the first event.\n\nI am curious how much of the base game we have seen in this beta and how much is expected to be held back for the full release of the game? Are there more zones the size of Kilima/Bahari planned? I'd love a forest with redwood trees or even the current zones with seasonal weather.\n\nThanks again for the time and effort put into Palia!\n\nEdit: formatting\n\n## Comment ID jybdzez with +2 score by [(RCMUSH-Senzo, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybdzez/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nHello!\n\nJust one question, which has repeatedly been asked by now: will the prices for outfits ever go down?\n\nHave a cozy day!\n\n## Comment ID jybdavt with +1 score by [(AineTheLonelyFox, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybdavt/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nCan we get fixes for the Soothsayer Outfit? For as unique as it is, it's criminally undercooked as an outfit. The outfit is visibly split into a top and bottom piece, but is a single-item one-piece outfit, and this alone can be deceptive if people look to mix and match it, since we can't preview outfits in the wardrobe, and we're forced to buy each outfit as a bundle (as in, the items are bundled, not bundling the 3 different versions). Similarly, the antlers for the Boreal and Arboreal seem to be using each other's particle effects, with both growing moss and creating ice at the same time.\n\n## Comment ID jybdfbr with +1 score by [(mumudesuyo, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybdfbr/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nHihi, I just want to ask if it'd ever be possible to host competitions wherein players design furniture and/or clothing sets? \n\nThis is something FFXIV does and I think it's such a cool idea to include the creativity of the players.

Darker colors along with white and black would be really nice. Espcially now that the larger Moonstruck pieces are no longer white when dyed Autumn.\n\nAnd lastly, would it be possible to add a height slider to our characters?

It's overpriced and uses the scummy practice of making you buy more coins then you need for what you want. Many times the player base has expressed that we're happy to financially support you but are unhappy with the current system as it makes us feel like cash cows and not valued players. The cash shop has turned many people away and honestly I don't blame them. Why are you charging prices like the cash shops of Final Fantasy 14, World of Warcraft, or even decade old mobile games like Summoner's War? $30 for a single outfit is not only insulting, it's unreasonable and out of budget for many people who would love to be able to toss some money your way over the life of the game. \n\nI can't help but feel the current cash shop is short sighted and would like to know if there are plans to fix it by lowering the overall cost of all items as well as changing to direct purchases instead of the (always) scummy practice of making players buy coins?\n\n## Comment ID jybat7m with +1 score by [(gdihq, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybat7m/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nThe pets are super cute, are there any plans to have them be more active?

What was the mindset behind deciding to release this game as an indie game, versus an AAA game? Most MMOs I've seen are from AAA developers, so I'm curious why you decided to branch off and release Palia as an indie MMO.\n2. Were there any unexpected hitches during development that you had to find workarounds for? If so, how have those workarounds affected the game as we see it currently?\n3. How does team-management work in regards to the development team? Coordination and compromising must be a big part of development, and I'm wondering if you could give any examples of a feature that had to be removed for one reason or another?\n\nOnce again, thank you so much for making this outstanding game, and I wish you the best!\n\n## Comment ID jybcdht with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybcdht/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nHello Palia Team,\n\nI was wondering when you guys will be working on the community function in-game as well as how will it be worked?\n\nThank you,\n\nLadyG\n\n## Comment ID jybd6rz with +1 score by [(mikeytlive, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybd6rz/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nWhen can we expect our first content update? \n\nDo you guys have any plans to make the skills progression system better?\n\n## Comment ID jybegbp with +1 score by [(Routine_Impact_3284, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybegbp/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nHave you ever thought about a big flow tree that will require 10, 15 or even 20 players to chop it down with a respawn of 12h, and a palium ore as well with the same respawn rate? and it could drop like 15 or 20 ores or planks?\n\nThere is any thoughts about farm animals, like cow, cheep, chickens etc etc...\n\n## Comment ID jybehqr with +1 score by [(RinaRin_, Reddit, 2023-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/jybehqr/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nHello. \n\nI was wondering if more free to play clothing and hair customizations are coming in the future?

Why on THIS outfit is it locked together when it follows the same pattern as others?\n\nI was intending to wear the outfit with the cowboy hat (please add more wide brim hats) and some pants (short shorts or work jeans).\n\nCan there be a further focus of prioritizing designing outfits so that they include THE WHOLE GENDER SPECTRUM...when possible?\n\nYou could have gotten a sale out of me with the Traveling Trader set, but made it fem-presenting only and left out the other part of your market.\n\nI had to request my money back for misleading me into thinking it was like other oufits without communication.\n\nI really liked the backpack and top, sadly, I had to request a refund.\n\n(would love to see a masc version of this set with cloth shorts and sunhat btw)\n\nUnrelated but still about Cosmetics...\n\nAre there plans to separate out shoes and backpacks for more customization?\n\nWould love to mix and match more styles, but given how constrained the system is (such as I want short shorts but you only let me wear them with flip flops)...\n\nHaving a variable system, especially when it's just model-to-skin like shoes for shorts...the ability to swap them when possible. Same for backpacks if an outfit accounts for one and you can swap the models and it work...let us swap it.\n\nThen communicate with a highlight system what in your menu can be swapped out in that section.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\----\n\nTLDR\n\n1. Please communicate when an item is only a one-piece vs a top/bottom split BEFORE purchase in a clear way (such as a small human icon highlighting in different colors the sections to denote if it is 1-2-or-3 separate pieces). This will reduce the amount of bottlenecking in your refund process that will occur due to lack of information.\n2. Please when designing outfits, include as many people on the gender spectrum as possible in a design OR release them in couples. It sucks to be left out of a really cool set (the backpack and top are my favorite things added so far but I HATE the pants and hat)...but I can't buy it and regret having to go through the refund process because it wasn't properly inclusive.\n3.

The majority of people playing are casual. We have a thing called work and a life. Things are too expensive.

I've been playing for quite a while and have never gone over 30k. I couldn't even get the large overpriced dragon prize during the event. Game devs really need to stop basing all their economic thoughts on hardcore players. Plus, this is a single-player game where you interact with other players.

You want people to chill and relax playing? Then stop turning it into a grindfest... I am starting to lose interest because it's so difficult to earn gold in the little time I have to play. Time is limited. If you alienate the majority, casual gamers, they will take their time elsewhere.\n\n## Comment ID kk5u8dt with +1 score by [(tornado1950, Reddit, 2024-01-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1650bkg/we_are_singularity_6_developers_and_publishers_of/kk5u8dt/) (in reply to ID 1650bkg):\nAfter u make the planks and brinks for your foundation then what?

It was basicaly Sci-Fi Warcraft, but it didn’t feel as “WoW clone” at all. The World Building was on point and it was all funny and jokes most of the time, but very serious when an important story archs happened. Just a perfect way how to tell a story imho.\n\nGameplay-wise it had everything what you wanted from an OG theme park mmorpg, but in a modern coat. Dungeons, raids, pvp bgs and arenas, ranked modes, awesome housing system, the list goes on. The best part? It released with all of that stuff. No “alpha” bullshit. Except for bugs and tuning, it just felt finished on the release day.\n\nMany people will disagree with me, but it was THE mmorpg for me. I played from start to shut-down and I wish I re-lived it again. My only real problems with the game was the simplified gearing system ( just 1 weapon per class ) and the telegraph spell system just wasn’t right in large scale battles ( most of the ground were just green and red circles and you couldn’t see anything in battlegrounds for example.)\n\n#### Comment ID lbb3stf with +29 score by [(Deadpoetic6, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbb3stf/) (in reply to ID lbb1yz9):\nTheme,  world, music, combat, housing, artstyle\n\n#### Comment ID lbck51e with +5 score by [(aplcdr, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbck51e/) (in reply to ID lbb1yz9):\nClasses were a lot of fun, I liked race design and the housing system is probably the best that there has ever been\n\n#### Comment ID lbbmdjc with +19 score by [(Akhevan, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbbmdjc/) (in reply to ID lbb1yz9):\n> What features did it have or what was so universally enjoyed about it?\n\nThe fact that it closed down.  \n\nIt was plagued by shitty design decisions and everybody largely hated it while it was still running.\n\n#### Comment ID lbbicbf with +31 score by [(BeatDownn, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbbicbf/) (in reply to ID lbb1yz9):\nPeople just want what they can't have.

There's no $2B Saudi deal to fall through like with Embracer (not that EG7 is playing anywhere near that level).\n\n### Comment ID lbbxvwr with +1 score by [(SirKronik, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbbxvwr/) (in reply to ID lbb2wlo):\nEverquest TLP server launches yearly w/ Krono sales going wild at the start of every server\n\n#### Comment ID lbbyfk2 with +2 score by [(Greaterdivinity, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbbyfk2/) (in reply to ID lbbxvwr):\nRevenue from Origins is likely both a fraction of what folks seem to think it is and also very unlikely related to this acquisition at all given that it was likely being negotiated well before they launched.

In short, they only planned to monetize cosmetics, but they'd be up front about changes.  \n\nAnyone that's played a Daybreak game can tell you that's not how they operate. Pay for convenience, pay to win, etc., whatever you want to call it, it's coming. When I messed with Palia briefly, it seemed like the most obvious cashgrab would be to sell wait time reduction on crafting or building objects.

They stay mostly hands-off, allow S6 team to develop within healthy timeframes and put out content.\n\n2. They grab unto the game with such force and forcefeed it more in store items (P2w items, convience items, premium pass,etc.)\n\n  \nFor now? I can't say for sure, but I am biased in my examination of the situation as Daybreak has been horrible about alot of cashgrab things, not caring for titles, etc. Overall, I hope the S6 team does well enough to support their families and relatives.

For a life Sim it lacks basic features, the decorating is nice but you can hardly interact with anything. Especially in town. Benches you can't sit in at all, a tavern where you can't sit eat, drink, nothing. \n\nAnd for an mmo it's like 20 people in a town map, and your alone in your home instance. They could have done a neighborhood like xiv so you can at least see some other houses without having to ask to be invited. \n\nThere is a clothing shop but it only sells clothes for premium currency, all \"basic\" clothes are just unlocked from the start. The shop is basically purely cosmetic as well since you just buy it from the store, from anywhere. \n\nThe character creator is pretty barebones as well, for a fully social game with no other real content besides rp. Like two body types, 4 faces, and maybe 20 hairstyles. This should have had City of Heroes level of customization or more.\n\n### Comment ID ky83aom with +23 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-04-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1bwiuin/cozy_mmo_palia_developer_singularity_6_has/ky83aom/) (in reply to ID ky6tkrn):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID ky9fot3 with +15 score by [(LaurenMille, Reddit, 2024-04-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1bwiuin/cozy_mmo_palia_developer_singularity_6_has/ky9fot3/) (in reply to ID ky83aom):\nAre they still instantly banning anyone that offers constructive criticism? \n\nI was part of the exodus of players that happened when they went on their banning spree with anyone that wouldn't parrot exactly what they said.\n\n#### Comment ID kyauig7 with +10 score by [(SyleSpawn, Reddit, 2024-04-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1bwiuin/cozy_mmo_palia_developer_singularity_6_has/kyauig7/) (in reply to ID ky83aom):\nI've *played* the game since Alpha (I think 3 years ago), the core problem is that what was available in Alpha was *exactly* what was delivered in Beta 2 years later.

Whatever that means to you, to me it means playing as and with a group.\nPalia has virtually zero of that. We can argue there's some in hunting and cooking. But barely. Feels more like something that happened by accident rather than design. The new tree dweller for instance is a lot of fun as a group.\n\nStill on the social aspect... No actual common goals.\nNo specialization and no trading. A spouse that farms whatever all day has no proper way to help their significant other than to actually go farm with them again. Random gift limits \nSocial Friend requests that cant be cancelled and forever perpetuate your list.\nOne of the 3 souls that still plays with me can't connect since the previous patch.\n\nTickets that have zero personalization. Straight out of a script and a request to send logs. Even on trivial things.\n\nPatches. There are many game devs here. We know how it is. HOWEVER... You can't always excuse it. If you already have the framework and are reskining things, the whole setup shouldn't break. Adding quest dialogue when you already have a quest system shouldn't be a server breaking ordeal.\nIf you are struggling with seasonal content like every other game does... You need a better testing group.\nThere has yet to be a single patch that didn't devolve into overtime. Not one. Even quick hotfixes have done it sometimes.\nAlso, if you add a \"let me do this quest later\" option... How about testing to make sure it works? A game breaking issue from the new NPC I saw no mention of since it was identified.\nYet, the new cosmetics keep coming at increased prices.\nI have no issue on this topic, but on the subject of optics, you have game breaking bugs but you project an appearance of cosmetics having priority, which will inevitably turn some players away.\n\nAnd finally, on the subject of PC player retention...\nWhile we understand you're aiming for a Switch release and probably have technical limitations to consider...\nDecades now of observing mmo players should be a STRONG indication that be it the competitive, builder or gatherer player type, \"more\" is the goal.\nHaving limitations has given you an (hopefully) unintended \"game over\".\nGold limitations, renown limitations, storage limitations, building limitations, heck, even farming limitations, are only going to turn the non casual player away. If you want players online most of their free time, this is not a good approach.\n\nIn sum, I have capped my gold, crafted all the furniture, maxed storage, farming, all rep is maxed...\nIt is now a game I sometimes load once a week to do weekly medals and forget about it the rest of the week. And even this amounts to 5 minutes of \"hey, want to catch 10 bugs with me?\". \n\nAnd then we load a game that let's us play together for a common goal.\n\nTldr, please make your social game... Social.\n\n### Comment ID kca3916 with +10 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kca3916/) (in reply to ID kc8noze):\n100% this.

Open beta and early access are now really just terms for games that have been released incomplete and probably not to a good standard. If anyone who wants to can play your game you've released it. \n\nAlpha beta etc used to be testing stages in development that would tell you how close to the finished product they were. Now games release as open beta and stay that way for years taking people's money at the same time. That isn't a testing phase. That is a company trying to get money from an unfinished product. \n\nPersonally I don't think beta games should be allowed to charge. The industry is largely unregulated and it shows that these practices have become accepted and normal. And it's leads to situations like this where people have invested in something in good faith which then performs pretty poorly\n\n### Comment ID kca5c5j with +7 score by [(ImpressiveElection94, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kca5c5j/) (in reply to ID kc8yzcr):\nI agree?

While they probably had some start up money (the founders are well respected names in the Gaming industry) that money won't last forever, where do the funds come from for this long of a beta/alpha/testing? They aren't asking for a monthly fee, it's not pay to win even in whatever phase it's currently in, which I confess, is a mystery to me even now but I do recognize they ask for nothing from us. Purchasing sparkly outfits helps to keep the lights on in Palia and pay their people, you know they are hurting when they lay off 35% of their workforce and if I recall correctly they are down to just 109 workers for Palia, while 109 sounds like a lot it's really not for an Online video game, a small workforce like that can strangle a game. Outfit choices are completely optional and NOT forced on you. No one is making you purchase anything. All those people playing for free need to thank the people who do purchase the trivial things from the clothing shop, they are the ones keeping Palia alive at the end of the day. I buy their outfits and I don't even think twice about it because I enjoy the game and DO want to see it fully released and receiving updates, doesn't bother me one bit it's Beta or whatever it is currently. I like the game and so I support the Game Studio to ensure I keep having fun.\n\n#### Comment ID kz771ut with +1 score by [(helen4952, Reddit, 2024-04-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kz771ut/) (in reply to ID kz6ptyo):\nEntirely missed the point but thanks for the comment\n\n## Comment ID kc9fiko with +18 score by [(Twiststitch, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc9fiko/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nSure S6 tells us the game is in Beta, but did anyone who started around the open beta believe this is where the game would be now? With both an announced \"Holiday 2023\" Switch release (which we know isn't going to happen) and the monetization with the opening and regular stocking of the premium store, we have/had every right to believe this game was in a trajectory to full release if not at a minimun more regular and bug free (or at least bug reduced) content updates.\n\nThis game is getting more unplayable patch by patch. And I just wonder how much of a coincidence it is the Switch release page was taken down before this disasterous patch. S6 couldn't pretend anymore that this game was coming to Switch any time soon?\n\n### Comment ID kc9tkj6 with +4 score by [(ImpressiveElection94, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc9tkj6/) (in reply to ID kc9fiko):\nYes, with those numbers I got now, I get why many anticipated more and aren't satisfied right now. The Switch situation is really making me anxious even though I can understand why. The game is nowhere near release for Switch. As far as I know, games on the Switch are usually so ready, that they aren't Beta anymore. This game needs much more time for that. Well, I hope they get it done with the bug fixing. I really like that game and the potential for the future, so I cheer for their success.\n\n#### Comment ID kcidcfp with +2 score by [(Stealthwarfox, Reddit, 2023-12-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kcidcfp/) (in reply to ID kc9tkj6):\nThey just announced last night at the game awards it will be released on switch December 14.\n\n## Comment ID kcad7kc with +14 score by [(kwonhoshi, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kcad7kc/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nI'm sorry but it's just embarrassing to release an update that renders the game unplayable.

But beta can't excuse all the problems  Palia has. Nor 'It iS fReE!11\". It's a product above all, and it simply must have some quality in it, otherwise it's just a bad product, free or not, beta or not.\n\nGame breaking bugs that prevent progress; quests that cannot be completed; horrible climbing. Most if not all those things MUST have been fixed in closed alpha (or at least closed beta), not be present in open beta for everyone to see. It's the job of QA department to find and fix those bugs before the game or patch it released. And those guys either don't exist, do their job poorly or have very little time to do it. Then it's management fault, making devs release new  patch every two weeks. But it can't be justified by 'It's just beta!'. It's bad decisions that lead to bad state of the game and then lead to players leaving.\n\nS6 is not a small indie studio, but right now this game is playing like some Steam early access indie game from a single developer. Or even worse, indie game from Patreon.\n\nI wish all well for Palia, but its current state is bad. If it was in alpha, sure, I would have no problem with that. But in open beta? Just nope.\n\n### Comment ID kc8jfym with +6 score by [(Shoddy-Temperature16, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc8jfym/) (in reply to ID kc7tb0d):\nQA doesn't fix bugs, QA finds and documents them. From there the bug is handed off to either the dev who owns the feature the bug exists in or more like to the production/project management staff who will decide when fixing it fits into the existing timeline and schedule. QA can in most cases argue for an increase in priority for the bug but usually a bug that is not \"this crashes or prevents players from playing the game every time for all system configuration we test on\" will end up finding it's way into the backlog. \n\nAt most places I have worked QA doesn't have access to commit code, nor are they paid enough to expect them to have that skill set. If they do have those skills they either jump ship to the game engineering side of the house or go the technical test analyst/software development engineer in test route and work on writing code to automate tests or make tools to help the manual tests work faster.\n\n#### Comment ID kc8onq5 with +4 score by [(Kirful, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc8onq5/) (in reply to ID kc8jfym):\nOkay, my bad, sorry.

If we want more quests, areas, progression, recipes, NPCs, events, game growth, etc. we need to understand that this happens, happens often, and we need to take a breath and understand that they’re doing everything they can to get things going again (if only so they can get home to their families).\n\nThe other thing I tell myself is that this is a free game. I have had subscription games that were down a lot in the first year. World of Warcraft was one of them. I participated from closed Beta on in that game (until Mists where I got bored) and the first year was rough with downtime.

Where I work (not game industry) the devs roll out several upgrades for several components daily. Generally you want deployment (and rollback) to be so easy and smooth that it's not stressful to deploy just whenever.\n\n> He’s had to long hours on a time crunch and then Bam! QA missed something and things have gone sideways and now his team has to stay over and figure it out. \n\nThis is, generally, an industry anti-pattern and a sign of poor workplace routines.

My objection is rolling out a sizable (in this game's history) patch with existing bugs not being addressed. Party invites being broken for the past two weeks  is very tangible. People bicker resources, especially flow, and being able to invite someone to your party would stop a lot of scolding as soon as it starts. Last I knew, the game was crashing when you clicked on a person's name to add them as a friend. These are fundamentals of the MMO model, and honestly essential to a game that markets itself as \"cozy.\" I'd honestly rather wait a week for the holiday update if we could get party invites and friend requests back. :)\n\n## Comment ID kc9sqtb with +14 score by [(relosa_, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc9sqtb/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nI am not really all that bothered by the bugs. Because it's beta. Stuff is just gonna go wrong, that's fine. I don't even care about the downtime. Am I pleased that it crashed/froze/required hard restart 5 times in one hour this morning and I couldn't fish? No. Am I terribly surprised it's *that* borked? Also no. Did I witness myself some of the QOL improvements and appreciate them? Very much yes. \n\nWhat I *do* care about is the unprofessionalism in communicating about it. It's immature and oddly self-centered and WAY too on-the-nose with the branding. What I'm about to say is in good faith because I *want* Palia to reach alpha, I *want* S6 to grow. Most are not gonna like it and will downvote because they don't understand the difference between business practices and branding.\n\nThere are specific things that *need* to be stated clearly in updates that weren't even mentioned. The website itself doesn't even have a server/game status page. Not everyone uses discord and it should not ever be the primary communications center.\n\nIf there's a major outage, planned or not, *especially* when they're the ones to pull it offline, that needs to be loud and clear on every platform they use. Scheduled outages should be sending emails as well. IMO it came across as that they *really* didn't want any new or casual players to know there was an outage at all. They *know* the daily players and community members would be on it. But it's the kind of thing you just have to own up to ASAP. \n\nContext: I have 10+ years in risk management, operations training, planning, comms, and hands-on emergency stuff.\n\nWhat their updates should have read like was:\n\n\"Hey everyone, we have some bad news. The patch release didn't go as planned and the demand on the servers plus bugs and errors clashed. We've taken everything offline and are investigating. While we're disappointed that you cannot enjoy Winterlight and the QOL fixes just yet, we understand this is probably even more disappointing for you. We'll let you know as soon as we have any information. You can find status updates at  \\[URL\\]. Thank you for your patience!\"\n\nOnce they had repairs under way and did not have an ETA:\n\n\"Good news is that we've located the issue and have begun correcting it. Unfortunately we don't yet have an estimated uptime and we'll definitely let you know when that changes. We do know that the issue was internal and your game and personal data is safe.\"\n\nClear, kind, respectful, informative, and not full of mealy-mouthed weirdly self-serving brand-speak that never once acknowledged the users except with really condescending comments like \"for those who are being patient\" and \"those who are sending positive vibes!\"\n\nMost of all, it comes across as *we have this under control.* But instead last night it came across as \"wow look at us doing our jobs! isn't that neat! boy are we tired!\" as if they were doing us a favor. \n\nFree or not, every player is still a consumer and S6 is a for-profit business. **This is their job;** no, I will not pat them on the back for doing it. Especially after getting it back online it's still having the same issues. What I *will* commend is if they manage the actual front-facing part well, which they did not. \n\nI know I'm gonna get downvoted for this but sorry, I'm right. I shared the messages with others in comms training and backgrounds. Some were Palians and some were not. I asked them what their impression was of the situation and they all came back with the same thing: short-sighted and unprofessional.\n\n This was a comms disaster. And it still is IMO. Not even mentioning the fact that the Switch thing was pulled with no information whatsoever and it hasn't been addressed as far as I know.\n\nBeta doesn't just mean the game itself but as a new and growing company it also means branding, crisis management, and retention. They are setting an extremely poor example of what happens when things might go even worse and if they do not sharpen communications they will not see the growth they deserve.\n\n### Comment ID kccmfjj with +3 score by [(BeneficialFault2269, Reddit, 2023-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kccmfjj/) (in reply to ID kc9sqtb):\nAgreed 100%. Due to how they communicate, which is poorly, they are not managing expectations correctly. \n\nThe silence around Switch not being released this year is very telling.\nThis in turn leads to frustration and bickering, especially in the Discord as this is where they announce anything instead of their own website with a status page. It's the same thing every single patch, it turns into \"remember it's only in beta guys\", \"send your love to the Devs they are working hard for us, \"if you're so upset about it/if you don't like it, then don't play/just leave\". \n\nYesterday someone upset over the Switch situation vented their frustrations in the Discord and proceeded to be bullied and talked down to with the phrases above and worse, with personal attacks just based off of their disappointment. \n\nS6 has fostered the community in this way with how passive aggressive they've been in coms previously and continues to do so with the examples you gave (for those who are being patient\" and \"those who are sending positive vibes!\"). \nIt's a very immoral practice when they're trying to act like we're besties (surprise, they want your money) and make people feel sorry for them which is weird and unprofessional.\n\nI've enjoyed the game and want it to succeed but with each patch it's getting further away from what they explained the game would be and while it has aspects of cozy, it's not hitting home in its current state.\n\n#### Comment ID kcdtp10 with +2 score by [(relosa_, Reddit, 2023-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kcdtp10/) (in reply to ID kccmfjj):\nThe exact same thing happened to me in the discord when I mentioned how unprofessional it was. What S6 is fostering isn't community (which would be inclusive of *all* players affected by a clearly-avoidable outage; not just \"the ones sending positive vibes!\") what they are fostering is toxic positivity which *will* lead to turning current and future players off for good. \n\nIf I was an investor in this company, I would be pissed that they don't have a dedicated PR/Comms person.

It's not. \n\n1. A few members of singularity6 are ex Riot games, you know like league of legends & valorant. Where network stability is an absolute priority.\n\n2. They're suppose to have like a 50million usd warchest for Palia. \n\n3. Unreal engine 4 is a very popular game engine that's been around for a few years with most of the bugs & kinks worked out of it. Frankly it's one of the best & most painless game engine to work with. \n\nFrankly, I like the game. It's has potential. I just wish the devs would hurry up.

I feel like there's some valid criticism of course after all it's frustrating to be playing a buggy and unfinished game and there's some bugs that are ok in beta and some that are game breaking. Still I'm completely with you, it's a game from a new small studio, no matter how experienced the developers are they don't have the same tools bigger companies do. And beta is their best tool to test and improve their game . I'm a software engineering masters degree student and so the bugs , the time for updates, the unfinished or not yet added features are very normal for me and don't bother me. About the game itself, since I'm busy with school I end up playing for just a few hours a day but I've identified that the game is a bit \"slow\" if you wanna play everyday all the time cus a lot of tasks take time, still there's a lot to do and I haven't explored everything yet. I love most of the objectives of the game and have a lot of fun. It really helps my mental health being so cosy and playing it so light-heartedly . I'm really excited for the festive updates and yesterday I really wanted to play cus I had just came from a test at college and ofc I was sad when they brought the servers back down. but I actually joined the discord like 2 days ago and seeing the updates...they're working, they're trying. And there's nothing more frustrating than finding bugs after fixing other bugs.

Other small studios have done this with great effect. Coffee Stain who produce Valheim is a good example.\n\nAll patches were first run thru thier Public Test Server (PTS) before being released to the \"live\" server. Everyone who participated on the pts, knew thier game could be rolled back & progress lost as devs worked out kinks in each update/patch. If you were not prepared to deal with that you simply waited for the updates to go \"live\" and it is probably one of the most stable games still in early release.\n\nI don't doubt for a minute that the S6 team are working their butts off trying to get the game working but I also think they need to concentrate more on core game play before introducing new cosmetics.\n\n## Comment ID kcbjzm6 with +5 score by [(magvadis, Reddit, 2023-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kcbjzm6/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nY'all there is no test server we are the test server.\n\n## Comment ID kc7tlhg with +14 score by [(BosEriko, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc7tlhg/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nWhen people say the team is small i always remember how stardew was created by a single person.\n\n### Comment ID kc8cd26 with +9 score by [(JoanyC11, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc8cd26/) (in reply to ID kc7tlhg):\nUndertale, Rollercoaster Tycon, Stardew, among others were made by single people in ways that are simply extraordinary. But it's exactly that to make a game alone you need to be quite the programming genius, know a lot of different areas and spend probably YEARS AND YEARS developing. Programming is hard (I'm a software engineer master's degree student) and most of the times to develop an app much simpler than a game you need a few elements of a team like a front end and backend developer, a team to make the design, a team to make the unit tests etc etc. It's amazing what some people do but if we expect every studio to do extraordinary things it's like expecting every human that has experience with science to be Einstein or something. Non the less some developers are faster than others and that's ok.

ConcernedApe dedicated his whole life to Stardew in an almost unhealthy way imo. even now, when he talks about it, you can tell he loves it, but he's sometimes so burnt out or frazzled.

Some teams have grandiose visions for 1.0 and leave on the beta label years after what is essentially 1.0. I think the only meaningful metric for a game being or not being in beta is if it is selling any sort of products - which Palia is doing.\n\nAt the end of the day I don't think it matters all that much if a game is in beta or not if you are a player and not a tester. You are rightfully upset if you have issues but you should manage your expectations against the reality of the dev team size and maturity of the game itself. Palia is a recently out beta MMO managed by a small team when it comes to MMO metrics and getting overly upset that it has issues is an error on your part. Take a break from any game if you find yourself overly upset.\n\n### Comment ID kcezam0 with +2 score by [(ImpressiveElection94, Reddit, 2023-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kcezam0/) (in reply to ID kcem21w):\nI srsly don't know what counts as small, but they seem to be around 160 people.

Yes, they are recently out in Open Beta. August was the start, right? I'd like to know, if there was something before that. Like a closed Beta or stuff. Even tho I don't believe it. \nAnyways, the game is still a baby. Some want to show their baby as soon as possible to others.

Maybe I'd change my opinion, if I were involved in the development? But yes, I agree.\n\n## Comment ID kc8x47c with +3 score by [(GurglingWaffle, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc8x47c/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nI think many of us have grown so accustomed to early access that we forget that it is not complete.\n\nI will say that beta is supposed to be done and only final testing is done to squish out bugs. At least this was the case before all this early access stuff began. But these days it seems more like alpha, where much of the game is still being developed. With every stage of added content we get more bugs. It is just the nature of the industry.\n\nSo I try to remember that I am playing a game that is only 1/4 or 1/3 done. If it gets too buggy I suspend play until I read it has improved. I only get upset when some bug has an impact on my character or account achievement or development and it cannot be reversed or fixed eventually. Like an achievement that doesn't trigger. (Real talk: I do get upset at other lesser things. But when my clear head rules, I remind myself to adjust my expectations to acknowledge the game is a work in progress.)\n\n## Comment ID kc7kon4 with +8 score by [(Lumpy-Narwhal-1178, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc7kon4/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nhttps://i.imgur.com/6I3LjqF.png\n\n## Comment ID kc8uvp3 with +2 score by [(Terrynia, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc8uvp3/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nWhen the servers finally came up at like 10-11pm (USA central time), i went fishing and got the star quality ancient fish….. it was still a lucky day for me!

Been waiting over 4/5 years for the completion of the game! Rejuvenation I meant \n\nPlease Note: I am sober writing this post but let my past experience gaming flow here! Lol!\n\nPalia is a good game, it has A LOT OF POTENTIAL, but it also has a few things that works against it: \n\nLet's start with the paid feature- the store items are too expensive. With or without the pet as an added bonus. If you spread out the costs a little more then people may be inclined to buy more. I don't have any original ideas but others may. \n\nGame play: between the main plot objectives the game gets a bit boring, but then again maybe I Have been playing it wrong because hunting for bugs or fishing may be optional but I'm too stupid to get that whole system- would rather hunt.\n\nTransport/travel: Now as Palia is a magical world without too much technology to ruin the aesthetics it still is a medium sized map (compared to Fallout 4) tiny compared to Minecraft and the Witcher 1 and small compared to Rejuvenation and Reborn.  That being said I became totally enthralled with the idea of (DON'T LAUGH) Hunting Down a MYTHICAL STAG/Bear to RIDE AROUND! Which adds another opportunity for more shop items! Even being able to customize that stag or bear brings a whole new bag of opportunity and problems.  \n\nPuzzles: I love solving puzzles and just hunting down some items that give more lore to the environment: Like what is it with the white structures scattered throughout Palia? Where has the former tenant of your plot of land gone? Is he truly nuts or was he DaVinci or Einstein or Galileo of the Palia universe?   \n\nFishing: I hate the system but then again I don't like that feature in rejuvenation either. But don't take it out I guess I am just a bit stiff about it. Just need to get used to it \n\nBuildings: I like the system you currently have, things clip easily and although it is limited it has great potential- I would just add some rounded structures and an option for top floors and stairs, heck a floor with a hole and a pole to swing down! Vines to climb up and down!  \n\nFurniture use: I don't know I would like to be able to store clothes in a cupboard, Like say I just bought a pink party dress and a green Elvin hunting set of clothes I want to open the cupboard and see them in there, but again don't stress this too much- none of the games I played got this right either!  Which neatly brings me over to the library: I would love to browse and buy books- recipes and bestiaries, I don't know maybe checklists for maybe the bugs and fish you collect with more information per the species you've encountered area they are available in with a spot on the map, time and the kind of fishing rod and bait required? \n\nQuests: Please forgive me but there are times that the dialogue plays and something happens in real life that makes you skip the dialogue by accident: cat jumps on the keyboard, baby slaps the mouse etc. and lets say that dialogue was important but you cannot go back and revisit that conversation which means you've missed something important to the story line or a hint as to where you are to go but a list of DETAILED explanations on the quest may be good for this, I had to go look at Wiki, Google, Reddit and YouTube way too many times as some of the quest descriptions are too vague or do not give you enough information from the get-go. Or add lines and optional clues in character dialogues. \n\nRarity of resources: Now this one may be interesting- bear with me: \n\nFallout 4 has a few medicines that are EXTREMELY RARE: X-Cell, Day Tripper, AND Daddy-O. Minecraft has diamonds that were extremely rare before the newest update, Craft the World has Heroes, Pokémon Rejuvenation and Reborn have Event and Legendary Pokémon: Now bare in mind I haven't really played long enough to completely say I have a handle on what is Really Rare- except for Pallium but this also has an exploit which takes away from it's rare status. May I suggest you remove the Group bonus feature from mining this RARE ingredient? As far as I understand it is Rare for a reason? \n\nFood crafting- I want to be able to see the food I make on a plate (not sure if it's in game but I haven't really explored food crafting too much either), Can I ask that one could be able to buy them from the library too?   \n\nRelationship status: Okay Now THIS was WHAT MADE ME QUIT!  You are told to find a shepp- THAT'S IT!  \n\nYou are not told that \n\n1) YOU CANNOT ASK ANYONE with a FRIENDSHIP LEVEL BELOW LEVEL 4 to be your shepp as they Will REFUSE YOU \n\n2) You cannot ask an NPC to be your Shepp more than ONCE  and Finally\n\n3) The Shepp option is ALWAYS available in the dialogue options thus if you get tired of their drivel and skip too quickly through their dialogue you have a VERY HIGH CHANCE OF Accidently asking them to be your Shepp  and all your hard work is GONE! \n\nFallout 4 has done this dialogue option EXTREMELY well by limiting WHAT you can say to which character at different relationship levels. I am sorry I am not going through all the ups and downs of building up a relationship level again. The characters that I was interested in becoming my Shepp I made the mistake of asking too early. The others bore me to tears or irritate me enough to try shoot them with the bow and arrows (doesn't work) \n\nNow please note I wrote this with a light-hearted approach and I mean this as constructive criticism. All and all I would love to play Palia again- I like the game, but as to the shepp quest- I asked and cannot ask again so this is a wall for me in the game and I won't be returning until that is resolved. \n\nNeither will I pay to play either.\n\n### Comment ID kca3kdl with +1 score by [(ImpressiveElection94, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kca3kdl/) (in reply to ID kc92o0n):\nFirst I'd like to thank you for the time you took to write all this! 😶 And don't worry, I think of it like constructive criticism.\nNow let's get started:\n\nTo the monetization I can't say much about a better approach besides that it may have been a bit too soon, if you think about the progress of the game. I think many might not consider it \"worthy\" of getting money as of now. Me included. As soon as I get the feeling that the game gets \"completed\", I might buy stuff. But that should take time, with what I've seen up till now. But then again, I see many in fancy costumes,  so it might work out after all? How to switch the numbers for more people to buy stuff is something I can't even imagine. I'm just too poor to buy stuff higher than 20€ without batting an eye.\n\nGame play might be repetitive very fast as there isn't much story quests right now, but I'm pretty sure they'll add more. Like more ressources in each category to farm and stuff. I don't think they'll change the system as I think they want the players to be able to do just what they enjoy. At least to a certain extent. You need to mine to make your axe better and stuff. But I think that's pretty normal in games. I find the game cozy and chill besides the bugs.\n\nTransport and Travel: Ooooh, I'd LOVE that!!!\n\nPuzzles: I love puzzles, too! I think some might come with new ruins, but I'd love small ones in the overworld, too!\n\nBuildings: Yes, PLEASE! Especially stairs, as soon as I built just one additional room I wanted it!\n\nLibrary: Yes, that would be great. I wouldn't be surprised, if they already considered it for the future. \n\nStory: Yes, I feel you! Even if I saw everything,  there are times I'd like to be able to look up what was said again. Hope they add something like that. \n\nRessources: There's a group bonus for mining? I know that fishing has it and foraging Flowtrees requires you to have someone tag along if it is a fully grown tree, but mining? I might have missed something? I'm still not a veteran in this game, so there might be things I just don't know. \n\nFood: You can place star quality food in your farm! On tables, in fridges, basically everywhere with a designated surface for putting stuff on/in it.\n\nNow I get back to the clothes as it's already possible with food, so making that available for clothes would be great! Just dunno how much work that is,  as I'm no programmer...\n\nRelationship: Yes, it's not really stated that you need friendship Level 4, before they'll become your Shepp.\nBUT!: You aren't lost! You can still get the person to be your Shepp even though you asked to early! I panicked with Tish as I asked her and the option to ask just disappeared. But through the community I got to know that when you reach Level 4 with your target person and complete the quest for that, after an in-game day the option reappears and you can get your Shepp! Again, it's not stated in-game. I'd like to be informed about both cases (knowing Shepp condition and that you can ask again after Level 4 Quest) in-game.\n\nI hope that alleviates your anxiety, which I felt, too and was really, REALLY unsettling for me, and you can enjoy the game more knowing you can still get your Shepp!\n\n## Comment ID kc8epn6 with +1 score by [(Strong_Investment312, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc8epn6/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nIf we choose to play a game in Beta, we accept that there will be bugs and glitches….it’s your choice to play or not to play.

      "# Post ID 1bqq6c8: Palia Dev Update: “we’ll keep our players updated with as much information as possible as we approach what we consider to be our official launch.” with +313 score by [(kyleblane, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/)\n[https://palia.com/news/dev-update-7](https://palia.com/news/dev-update-7)\n\nFull Text (of beta section)\n\n>**Palia is Currently in Open Beta**  \n>  \n>We want to clear the air: since our Open Beta launch back in August 2023, the **game remains as a title still in Open Beta**. Know that we’ll keep our players updated with as much information as possible as we approach what we consider to be our official launch.  \n>  \n>We're aware that there has been feedback regarding our messaging and status on various platforms, but the emphasis is that Palia is free-to-play and available for anyone to try. It is a continuous, ongoing effort, and we are committed to providing patch updates with new content, improvements, and bug fixes well into the future.  \n>  \n>In fact, looking at our version, being on 0.178 means we’ve made over 178 updates to the game! Even from the start, and the days of Pre-Alpha, we made sure to include player feedback and have it shape Palia to be where it is today. And when it’s ready, we also plan to have the versioning update from “0.XXX” to “1.XXX” to better reflect Palia’s new status — but even that is not the end. We’ll keep having more patches after, and developing Palia alongside our players. That was one of the primary reasons why we wanted it to be a free-to-play, live-service game.  \n>  \n>We invite everyone to be part of this journey.\n\nFirst of all, when you need to \"clear the air\" that your game is still in beta you've failed at the most basic communication about your game.\n\nThe bare minimum required to provide \"as much information as possible\" as your game approaches launch is to properly inform players that the game hasn't yet been launched. Steam and Epic versions should be in Early Access. Switch should have some form of \"beta\" mentioned somewhere. The word \"beta\" should exist somewhere on the website other than news updates and the EULA. It's a very easy decision to make, and a very easy change to implement.\n\nThis dev update is void of any definitive action they're going to take. They only say that they are aware of the feedback and are focusing on communicating that the game is free (As if the two messages can't coexist LOL). I hope I'm wrong and this is just a poorly worded update, but I don't expect to see any communication changes regarding the beta status of the game.\n\n## Comment ID kx6h2br with +72 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx6h2br/) (in reply to ID 1bqq6c8):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID kx7hkxm with +17 score by [(OreoYip, Reddit, 2024-03-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx7hkxm/) (in reply to ID kx6h2br):\nI am okay with the conversations but honestly, it is getting a bit old hat.

UI text size sliders - for people who are playing on Steam Deck for example! Brightness sliders - maybe you just prefer your games to not be that bright! And then other accessibility options  include making the temples doable without having to do complicated maneuvers and having to react at exactly the right time etc etc - some disabled players won't be able to fulfill the challenges at all as they are now, but even players who can fulfill the challenges might not want to do this kind of challenge. I personally get super annoyed with all of the temples, as the rest of the game (except for hunting and some bug catching stuff) is way lower stakes and I fucking hate when I have to jump precisely in games. So I'd profit from an option to do this challenge in an easier way, too (and my keyboard and desk would love that too cause I get really angry and frustrated 😅)\n\n### Comment ID kx4dyj4 with +24 score by [(TheSilentTragedy, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx4dyj4/) (in reply to ID kx4914c):\nAlso this. Many of my friends (many of which were active members of the accessibility channel there) were banned the other day for asking questions, one was banned simply because they wanted to know why their mute had persisted longer than it was supposed to (they were muted for an extra hour instead of the original mute time). \n\nTheir mods/devs have admitted that they have a hard time remaining unbiased regarding critic of the game - in my most respectful and honest opinion, the biggest problem they have (in regard to their Discord) is a lack of a well-acting, level-headed moderation team.\n\n#### Comment ID kx4efjj with +25 score by [(kyleblane, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx4efjj/) (in reply to ID kx4dyj4):\nEarlier on Discord I was asking about details regarding this dev update.

I base it on the reviews. But I'm reading this post from the devs and think they are back peddling due to backlash. Honestly, imo it's easier to justify bugs for games in early access. It would be to their advantage to put it under the early access banner. Why they didn't, I don't really understand. People would give them a pass for bugs. \n\nMaybe they should mention at least in the text of the steam store for the game that it's in beta. Not hidden in the announcement.

Please forgive any crappy formatting on mobile.\n\nDecember 2023 Switch update:\nNo mention of Beta anywhere on the Nintendo eshop page. For weeks leading up to the release multiple members in the discord tagged CMs asking for clarification. CMs would conveniently disappear from conversation or straight up ignore the question while responding to other members. Game launches and what’s missing from the splash page on the switch? The beta tag. The excuse then became “oh well Nintendo doesn’t do beta/early access so take it up with them”. Sandrock was quite literally hosting an early access at this time. \n\nFebruary 2024:\nThey announce the steam release. Members point out that the MMO tag has been scrubbed and there’s no mention of the game being in beta. Every week members would be tagging the CMs to ask and get clarification, warning the CMs that this would lead to negative reviews. The CM response was gifs and saying they’d pass it along to the rest of the team. Members also noted that the Palia website had also been scrubbed of the beta label at this time.\n\nBefore this they were telling people they banned for questioning the lack of beta tag that they had no control over what steam labeled the game as and now it’s too late because once a game has been published you can no longer mark it as early access and beta. \n\nI know this doesn’t matter to some people and I think that’s perfectly fine BUT for some of us a company being intentionally deceitful repeatedly is a big red flag. Many of us have played for hundreds of hours, sunk money into the game and built a community with people inside and outside of the game so we’re feeling quite passionate and honestly concerned about the way things are going. \n\nI’d also like to add this is a team that brags about being industry vets, these are people that know what they’re doing and are now trying to handwave all this away with “oh we’re still learning”. This isn’t a small indie team and hell even small indie teams know to mark a game in beta/EA. Honestly this dev update is only in response to the negative feedback there’s not even any mention of accountability, this wording it reads to me like “well it’s free so who cares”. I care! They have a cash shop and yes it’s optional BUT there is still a way for people to spend money on game by a company that is intentionally trying to mislead its player base and I’m sorry but I’m not okay with that.\n\n### Comment ID kx4ktvz with +25 score by [(kyleblane, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx4ktvz/) (in reply to ID kx4k5ml):\nBravo for good formatting on mobile.

I don’t want to yuck other peoples yum lol! I haven’t left a review and try not to speak negatively of the game even in the discord now because I can see it’s bringing a lot of people joy BUT I also feel like it’s causing people to have major blinders on.

Thanks OP for sharing and I completely agree with your take! \n\nThe update from the Palia team comes off defensive and doesn’t have any accountability in the failure to communicate the status of their game. It being free doesn’t negate it from criticism or basic expectations of knowing it isn’t fully launched. \n\nThis honestly makes me want to uninstall.

You should be happy we did (the bare minimum) hard work with sit-tech and now you can sit in chairs so stop pestering us.\" Post. (Not the exact quote but it did feel very passive aggressive)\n\nI remember saying that despite this game being free with optional microtransactions, this was going to be one of those barely updated, barely fixed games with barely anything in it worth playing but the store would be absolutely cluttered with new stuff. What happened when I stated that? \n\nDeath threats(yes. I kid you not lmfao) the typical \"It's free. Stop complaining.\", then there were the \"They're taking their time to get it right. If you don't like it don't play it.\" (I stopped around the time they dropped the news that outfits will always be microtransactions) and then people telling me that I was too poor to play the game and I was just a poor hater. Lmao. \n\nWell, despite all those people jumping my butt, I am glad but also disappointed to see that I was mostly right. It's a shame because I hoped they'd take player feedback seriously and make this a game worth sticking around for...but once again, game companies be game company-ing. Glad I didn't hang on to that hope and get let down like I am sure many others have. \n\nI am sorry to those who looked forward to this game being something amazing. Hopefully the game grind loop is enough to keep you playing long enough until a better game comes out for you. Hopefully before they decide that \"It is with a heavy heart that we shut down servers to Palia.\" When theyve finally made enough off their little money maker disguised as a free game.\n\n### Comment ID kx4rbml with +18 score by [(PlantPotStew, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx4rbml/) (in reply to ID kx4mb9l):\nThis reminds me a lot of Disney Dreamlight.

I got hundreds of hours\" Can have their fun. Ideally every game would have a redemption arc like No Mans Sky and Cyberpunk.\n\nIt's exhausting to see casual gamers defend this type of stuff again and again. Sure, they can make their own decisions*, but I thought ignorance was the issue. But it's not, they literally don't care and don't want to care, and... I see this in politics and so many other more important areas that it's just annoying. Companies/whatever are going to keep getting worse because people will keep buying/voting the same way because they just don't care. Worse, they'll shut you down so they can keep living in ignorance.\n\nI get that this seems a bit dramatic, it's just a game, but... eh. It's a pattern. Dystopian Sci-Fi writers don't see the future, they recognize a pattern.\n\n\n*Saying this, because if I didn't, they'd say that it's their right to think so.

Its a free game, I downloaded the day it released on Switch, the 0.XXX always made sense as beta for me, and I've already sunk 160 hours into Palia, more than any other game on my Switch, including ones that were $60. \n\nIs it perfect? No. Is it done? No. There are bugs and glitches but for me that was expected and as someone who is not active on the discord or subreddits it feels like people are overly pissed off about the game and being kinda dickheads to the devs. \n\nIf you don't like it or don't like the devs or don't like their communication, then don't play it! No one is holding a gun to your head forcing you to play or talk about it lmfao. I just personally don't understand sinking a bunch of time into talking about something you don't like. If the game had a cost and people had paid for it and been upset about it being in beta I would get that but like worst case scenario you downloaded a free thing and it were dissapointed because it wasn't what you expected.

You seem more dismissive, then interested, in learning why this could be important. I'm not the best at this topic, but-\n\n> If you don't like it or don't like the devs or don't like their communication, then don't play it! No one is holding a gun to your head forcing you to play or talk about it lmfao\n\nIs a terrible stance to take about this type of stuff. I know you'll probably say \"It's just a game\" but it's important to talk about how companies conduct themselves. \n\nMicrotransactions and other unsavoury tactics like that flourish when people dismiss them as \"Just cosmetics, game is still free.\" Despite games like this specifically attempting to make you spend your money on cosmetics (20$ for a digital outfit). When other companies notice there's a way to squeeze more money out of you, they'll start engaging in worse tactics, making levels specifically harder so you cave and buy more lives just to play the games. Or specifically making the feedback loop more addictive, or making it easier for children who aren't as aware of these tactics to buy things. \n\nYou could say \"It's the parent's job to prevent that\" But we have laws specifically to make dangerous/addictive things regulated, because we understand that the average person might not be educated enough to avoid them.\n\nI don't know if palia specifically falls into this category. But being open about EA is also important. When Disney Dreamlight came out, people bought the full game for 60$, because they specifically hid the fact that it is EA and the full game will release for free later. You're specifically buying to play earlier. It seems small, but the more stuff like that gets hidden as \"Not a big deal\" The more companies will continue to shift around things that they KNOW people want to know, and hide it because if a person did know, they wouldn't have bought/played it. You have a right to know what you are investing (Time, money, etc.) in.\n\nLying by omission, if not called out, is encouraged. You can get games who have been funded by millions only for all the news to be wiffle waffled on. And this keeps happening, because we don't talk about Early Access and the cons with it enough. Because casual gamers don't normally keep up with the news enough to see a pattern and think it's just a fluke that dumb people fell for. That they're smart and will never fall for similar predatory tactics.\n\nWhile people are supposed to make informed discissions, we also have to acknowledge that in the age of overinformation, it's not possible. If the only way to know if something is EA is by going on Twitter, or any other completely unrelated social network, you messed up! Transparency is the most important thing that can be done. If you can only tell it's a beta by seeing 0.2.4.5 version, it's not transparent, it means that people have to be tech savvy enough to understand what section of a version code means it's beta or finished.\n\nI also found from that experience a lot of casual gamers, who admit that this was their only game, didn't really understand a lot of game mechanics. Why having to spend 6+ hours mining rocks to make a basic decoration wasn't an acceptable grind, because they enjoyed doing mindless activities for 6 hours! Don't like it? Don't play it! We didn't, but before we left we decided it was worth explaining why, from our experience of MMO's gone bad, it's a sign on the wall.\n\nWhy having constant bugs and patches introduce more bugs, from experience in EA gone bad, were signs on the walls. \"All games have bugs, jeez\"\n\nWhy having the first microtransaction, from experience in mobile games, were signs on the wall. \"It's just clothing, don't like it? Don't buy it!\" despite a single chair being 20$ \"You don't need it\" Despite more things getting locked further and further, keeping an intentional cycle on FOMO.\n\nThey mostly subscribed to the same philosophy of \"It's free, and I got a lot of content out of it, so who cares about [microtransactions], [terrible dev communication], [terrible grinding mechanics]\" Which is fine, but they also refused to allow others to put in their two pence. Saying \"You're being toxic\" or \"Bringing down the mood\" or \"Why does everyone always have to complain, don't like it, don't play it!\" As if we can't have a discussion on anything but positive things. \n\nI think they see a lot of people, and forget that those individuals don't see others complaints are a part of their own, so instead of one person sharing one problem, it's hundreds sharing that one problem. Making it seem much more dramatic then it is for those people individually. I will admit some people take things too far, especially if the dev starts shutting down any mild conversations, extreme ones start surfacing.\n\nIf you've played video games for decades, you start seeing the same patterns that ruined other companies and games. You start recognizing the trend that gaming is going down.\n\nWe don't play it, but we also learned that boycotting doesn't work and companies will still cut as many corners while getting as much money as possible. We still feel like we should talk about it, at the very least, even if most people just shrug their shoulders and say \"Who cares? I still had fun.\"\n\nSorry, turned long and probably isn't as coherent as I'd like it to be.\n\n#### Comment ID kx5swdt with +4 score by [(ControlledEuphoria, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx5swdt/) (in reply to ID kx4o2h6):\nJust had to say I thought this was incredibly well thought out and perfectly coherent! I agree so much about transparency especially when it comes to beta/EA. I’m considering supporting Farmfolks even though they had a disaster of a first kickstarter based solely on the fact that the new team has been putting out consistent clear messaging. It’s so important we all do our part to try to keep companies accountable so that the beta/ea tag doesn’t immediately tank a game. Especially in the farming/cozy game community because a lot of these games get picked up by people that can’t or don’t have the time to spend navigating discords/reddits/steam forums to learn that the game they just downloaded is incomplete/has issues. Straightforward clear and consistent communication that is easily accessible to a consumer base is key.\n\n### Comment ID kx4gw5o with +12 score by [(Disig, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx4gw5o/) (in reply to ID kx4ecuc):\nYou've completely missed the point of the post.

They don't know they're buying cosmetics for an unfinished game.\n\nSecond, it speaks poorly of their management. Communicating that the game is in beta would only do good things for them and players have been saying this for a very long time. They've banned members of the Discord for questioning it, even going as far as telling them they're spreading false information. There is no good reason NOT to communicate the game is in beta, only selfish, deceitful reasons.\n\nBonus reason: It's good to be clear and honest.

You build your avatar, name it and then you are interacting with real people on the servers, not NPCs.\n\nI suspect the devs' intentions for static names is for players to be less likely to misbehave and more likely to commit to playing with integrity. To be building a social community around our avatar's identity.\n\nThats just a guess-- this is my first MMO, and I know that it's not a typical MMO. But its a cozy MMO, which is new.\n\nI have made friends here, and if they were to change the name of their avatar I wouldn't know who they were anymore.\n\n### Comment ID kquubx4 with +13 score by [(Mod-chick, Reddit, 2024-02-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1at3chd/baffled_that_you_cannot_deleterename_your/kquubx4/) (in reply to ID kquigcy):\nYes.

Or when you bring your character into the game world and notice your name doesn't really match well with the way other people are naming their characters, etc.\n\n### Comment ID kqwdwty with +3 score by [(fragmented_mask, Reddit, 2024-02-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1at3chd/baffled_that_you_cannot_deleterename_your/kqwdwty/) (in reply to ID kquigcy):\nThat said, other MMOs allow you to delete a character and create a new one if you need to which I think Palia should do!\n\n## Comment ID kquzrel with +4 score by [(teenbangst, Reddit, 2024-02-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1at3chd/baffled_that_you_cannot_deleterename_your/kquzrel/) (in reply to ID 1at3chd):\nYou can submit a ticket and they will change it quite quickly, but you can only change your name once every 6 months.\n\n## Comment ID le43a6r with +3 score by [(misscloud, Reddit, 2024-07-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1at3chd/baffled_that_you_cannot_deleterename_your/le43a6r/) (in reply to ID 1at3chd):\nThe entire account and character creation system for Palia is busted.\n\nYou can't delink your account from Steam. I have 1,300 games on my Steam account (early adopter, lots of Humble Bundles, etc.). I'm not creating a new Steam account to play Palia without my full name being displayed.\n\nI was told to contact support. The support page says they're no longer allowing character renaming, but you can email support anyway. My first ticket disappeared. My second ticket is just hanging there.\n\nAt this point I'm just going to uninstall.\n\nThey had tens of millions of dollars to create this game and honestly I'm completely blown away by how poorly they've managed to create and implement basic functionality. I have played games made my small teams of hobbyists that have fully functioning account and character features.\n\n### Comment ID le4g8us with +1 score by [(dEEkAy2k9, Reddit, 2024-07-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1at3chd/baffled_that_you_cannot_deleterename_your/le4g8us/) (in reply to ID le43a6r):\nI actually got the character name changed through a support ticket.\n\nYour point still stands though.\n\n## Comment ID kqvkiv0 with +10 score by [(cennaya, Reddit, 2024-02-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1at3chd/baffled_that_you_cannot_deleterename_your/kqvkiv0/) (in reply to ID 1at3chd):\nValid criticism, sure, but jeez dude, the drama of this comment.

U do know that to have an account some field needs to be a key, that key must be unique and since it's used as an identifier it's hard to change. \nWhen an account has more than one character it's one thing, now if this is ur username this is just as standard practice as using an internal id. Just be more careful next time. Everyone makes mistakes and u seem to have submitted a support ticket and they'll prob help you.

The entire team was fantastic, the content we made was fun to work on, and there was a lot of room for personal growth. \n\nThe technical challenges were always fruitful and we learned as we resolved them. S6 truly feels like being part of a family. Everyone works together. The seniors/leads are very kind and patient in explaining technicalities and they make sure you understand the reason for things to work the way they do. \n\nIf you want to learn and grow in your discipline, S6 is the place to do it. Not to mention you'll get to work on some amazing content!\n\nThe best part of it all, in my opinion, is the team dynamics. Being a skilled professional is important, but couple that with a great personality and you have the perfect colleagues. I did not meet a single employee at S6 that did not fit this bill.",

It breaks my heart that a project where ~200 folks poured themselves into got ruined by poor decision making made by a handful of people. They hired massively talented people, truly the best in the industry, just to ignore their wisdom and experience. \n\nInitially the studio prided themselves in taking care of one another, but the last couple years it has been asking people who are running on empty to keep pushing further, Exhaustive and repetitive. Some folks became ill from overwork.\n\nLeadership had and still has very little diversity, which is painfully noticeable in the type of decisions taken.\n\nTeam structuring creates massive silo-ing and strong \"our team vs. yours\" in terms of output. Very little collaboration is possible, slowing the whole project down. Never worked at a place so inefficient.",

This applies to frontline managers all the way up to top leadership. This is despite parading a feedback culture. ICs who provide feedback have the feedback turned around and weaponized against them in performance reviews or elsewhere. The company is packed full of very talented ICs who are deprived of the support they need to succeed, and then blamed and take punishment when things don't go the way leadership wants them to. \r\n\r\n\r\n- Dishonesty and deceit is rampant in communication to employees. Never have I seen such a level of dishonest behavior from leadership, especially at such a small company. I can understand a need to be careful on what information to be transparent with, but the leadership very frequently, intentionally, and blatantly lies to everyone at the company about the state of the company. The sad part is that these lies are very shallow and most people see through them, but they serve their short-sighted purpose of keeping the illusion of the \"everything is fine\" dog. One example is telling everyone there will only be a few weeks of \"targeted overtime, not crunch\", knowing full well that it would last indefinitely for many.\r\n\r\n - Diversity problems explicitly ignored by leadership because it's not a \"priority,\" despite the large human impact of them. The company made big promises around D&amp;I to employees, and has failed to live up to them. And recently things have gotten much worse. \r\n\r\nThere are many other problems I did not list here. I fear that many more good people at the company will be hurt by the reckless course management is taking the company.",

The company is packed full of very talented ICs who are deprived of the support they need to succeed, and then blamed and take punishment when things don't go the way leadership wants them to. \r\n\r\n\r\n- Dishonesty and deceit is rampant in communication to employees. Never have I seen such a level of dishonest behavior from leadership, especially at such a small company. I can understand a need to be careful on what information to be transparent with, but the leadership very frequently, intentionally, and blatantly lies to everyone at the company about the state of the company. The sad part is that these lies are very shallow and most people see through them, but they serve their short-sighted purpose of keeping the illusion of the \"everything is fine\" dog. One example is telling everyone there will only be a few weeks of \"targeted overtime, not crunch\", knowing full well that it would last indefinitely for many.\r\n\r\n - Diversity problems explicitly ignored by leadership because it's not a \"priority,\" despite the large human impact of them. The company made big promises around D&amp;I to employees, and has failed to live up to them. And recently things have gotten much worse. \r\n\r\nThere are many other problems I did not list here.

Stop changing the priorities all of the sudden.\n\nGame Dev – Improve the core experience and fix the frustrating bugs and broken player accounts, and add time to testing content. It’s embarrassing how many typos and errors are shown to our players because we’re rushing and not leaving time for testing.",
        "cons": "Beta launch in August of ‘23 made it hard to ignore the problems with leadership…Rigid thinking, no long-term roadmap for business or game, and basically a lack of self-awareness. Very little capable/experienced management, that breeds crunch, teams that are not aligned, competing engineer resources, wheel-spinning, and new priorities near-daily.\n\nPeople are super nice, but might be too nice and not speak up. But our input doesn’t seem to make a difference in leadership choices so maybe people are just burnt out and it seems like “nice” because they're submissive. Also a lot of core people who really cared are voluntarily leaving the studio.\n\nCompare these GD reviews from before August of ‘23 to after. Pre-beta launch the studio was buying the dream, but now we are seeing the reality is not good.",

Not to mention you'll get to work on some amazing content!\n\nThe best part of it all, in my opinion, is the team dynamics.

Some folks became ill from overwork.\n\nLeadership had and still has very little diversity, which is painfully noticeable in the type of decisions taken.\n\nTeam structuring creates massive silo-ing and strong \"our team vs. yours\" in terms of output.

      "# [The Software Architecture of Palia](https://www.singularity6.com/news/software-architecture-of-palia)\nSingularity6’s debut game, Palia, is a free-to-play cozy online multiplayer community simulator. A place where players can play alone or with their friends to experience a beautiful and welcoming world which can be explored and personalized.\n\nSocial interaction and a persistent shared world are key features of the game. But these elements are also some of the most challenging to implement, scale, distribute geographically, and operate at minimal operational cost and negative player impact.\n\nPlayers experience the art and soul that our development team has poured into the game, but the infrastructure that makes it all possible behind the scenes is hidden from view. We are proud of what our team has accomplished with Palia, and we want to spotlight the studio’s hard work, including what players don’t experience directly. We also want to share some important lessons learned during our journey; we hope that sharing the lessons learned while developing Palia can be useful to others facing similar challenges.\n\nNow follow us behind the scenes of our Palia development journey!\n\nGame Engine\n\nBuilding an online multiplayer title from scratch benefits from a robust and proven game engine. We made the choice to build Palia using Unreal Engine. Unreal gives us powerful tools to build with out of the box, such as a strong networking and replication library to build social features, a graphics pipeline to build a beautiful world, a powerful physics engine that can simulate complex environments, and so much more. We use Unreal Engine for our game servers as well as our client, which gives players a real-time interactive environment.\n\nEach instance of the game server currently hosts up to 25 players, and we split up each server by what we call a map. These can be permanent fixtures, including our central hub Kilima Village, or even temporary available experiences, such as our Maji Market, which was only available for one month during our Luna New Year in-game event. When players travel between maps in Palia, the game client disconnects from one server and connects to a new one. We will share more details on how this works in our matchmaking service deep dive section.\n\nThis synergistic model is crucial for our team: we can develop most of the logic for Palia inside the engine and deploy to both clients and servers. This allows anyone on the team to test both the game and the game server in editor mode, which has been critical for our development velocity.\n\nSpotlight: memory leakage\n\nUnreal Engine servers are commonly used in “session-based games,” such as Fortnite: games that start and end within a certain amount of time. Memory leakage is not a big concern for session-based games because a new server is spun up for a new match and destroyed when the match ends. Any leaked memory will be cleaned before the next batch of players begin playing.\n\nPalia is a persistent shared-world game and the lifespan of our game servers is variable depending on how players move through the game world. A single game server may remain online and serve players for an entire patch cycle which could be weeks. Memory leakage which is cleaned up regularly for a session-based game can grow and compound, and small leaks might end up consuming two or even four times the amount of Random Access Memory (RAM) proportionally affecting our operational costs.\n\nTo combat this issue, we invested in solutions to help us identify memory leaks, and we spent useful time designing nudges for players to travel between maps as to increase the likelihood that a server would empty out and be shut down.\n\nUnexpectedly and fortunately, increasing geographical distribution helped with this problem: hosting servers near players not only helps with latency (because it reduces the distance that signals need to travel); but also with rotating empty servers because players tend to play at the same times, making it rare that somebody in that region is playing in the middle of the night and increasing the probability of servers to become empty, shut down, and cleaned.\n\nThis screenshot from one of our monitoring dashboards shows the memory usage of a portion of our game servers over a24h period in Feb 2024. The trend of linear memory increase is clearly visible.\n\nServices\n\nThe game client and servers talk to our services for specific actions, such as logging players into the game, loading characters, saving progress, sending chat messages to other players, making purchased outfits are stored in the player’s closet and many more.\n\nWe loosely follow a “microservice” posture, in which we prefer to host many different services specialized on one player feature.\n\nWe use HTTP as the North/South protocol (in and out of the datacenter) while we use gRPC for East/West communication (for services talking to each other inside the datacenter).\n\nWe use Rust exclusively as the programming language for our services and we try to include both integration and load testing as part of the definition of “done” for key services, including matchmaking, player presence and player state persistence which represent the largest percentage of our request load.\n\nOur unit and integration tests are also written in Rust, but we use Locust to support and execute our load tests. Locust load tests are written in Python which is simpler to program. The ability to quickly write and modify load tests was beneficial to us and sped up adoption.\n\nSpotlight: Rust for Microservices\n\nRust is a beloved programming language by many systems programmers because it provides state-of-the-art protection against common software vulnerabilities (buffer overflows and race conditions, for example) without introducing any performance penalties.\n\nRust is also a modern programming language. It is surrounded by a diverse and vibrant community of contributors and a wide range of libraries and tools. Documentation is excellent (especially onboarding tutorials) and the compiler is surely one of the most helpful and user-friendly.\n\nOf course, no programming language is perfect. Rust's posture is heavily focused on correctness, which is generally beneficial, but comes with a significant upfront cost which is visible in our development velocity. Rust makes it very hard to “cut corners” and punt hardening for later. It is a very good quality when something that was supposed to be just a prototype becomes load bearing in production by sheer pressure of business needs, but it makes it hard to move quickly and with agility around shifting requirements (which is a constant in startups and game development).\n\nThe other issue was hiring and onboarding. Rust’s relative youth as a programming language makes it somewhat difficult to hire people that have production experience with the language. Although the language is very popular, few people have used Rust in a professional team setting. Most people who have Rust experience have only used it for personal projects. With this in mind, onboarding took much longer than we expected. We factored 90 days to get engineers up to speed, but it turned out to take at least 6 months for most of the team to get comfortable and confident with the language.\n\nWe are very happy with the performance, latency, scalability, robustness and security of our Rust services. But there are moments when we wonder how much opportunity cost was spent in forcing up-front solidity of every piece of this layer.\n\nWe consider it an advantage for the studio to have managed to amortize those onboarding costs and the maintenance costs of our services is indeed very low, but those thinking of following our footsteps down the Rust path, should be willing to allocate a significant effort to education and onboarding. These costs will likely reduce over time as Rust becomes more popular in production settings, but it’s unclear what that rate will be.\n\nSeveral of our services are interesting and sophisticated enough to merit more attention: player state management and matchmaking.\n\nPlayer State Management\n\nWe consider player state all the information that a game server needs to recreate the most recent game world experienced by the player. The architecture of our game is server-authoritative which means that game servers decide the state of the world and act as referees when game clients report inconsistent data (for example, because of time delay in transmission). We took this route because Palia is a social game so a player cheating or modifying their state could have a negative impact on the experience of other players. The risk of cheating is reduced when it's our system that ultimately controls player state.\n\nThe simplest way to persist state is to wait until a player exits a game server and have the server send this information to the database. Unfortunately, this makes state changes in that server vulnerable to the server itself crashing and losing that data (which is only kept in volatile memory for performance reasons). Instead, several times a second we check for player state changes, and if there are any, that data is immediately queued and sent to the database to be persisted.\n\nSpotlight: data first vs. schema first\n\nA source of contention around player state is the modeling lifecycle: who and what decides what is valid to be stored into such a state? Traditional data-modeling techniques suggest a “schema first” approach: the structure of the data (the schema) is created ahead of time and then only data that conforms to that structure can be saved into the database.\n\nThis has the advantage that the database validates the shape of the data. The disadvantage is that one has to know ahead of time the structure of the data needed… which can be challenging to coordinate across different teams.\n\nTo increase the ease with which game engineers and technical designers could work, we decided on a different model in which the structure of the data would be decided in C++ structs directly within Unreal and then marshaled and persisted in the database as a binary blob (using the Flexbuffer format). The schema is the struct declaration itself and we use Unreal’s runtime type reflection system to export the schema to our database.\n\nThe advantage of this architectural choice is that it enabled game engineers to develop features that required state persistence without the need for constant coordination. The downside is that the data is opaque to the database, which is more expensive to keep uniform and consolidated. This has required us to invest in additional tooling around the player state management system to validate, backup, modify and correct player state when it diverges from the expected structure.\n\nDespite the additional layer of development investment needed to provide hardening on top of what the database normally provides, we believe this architecture has significantly cut down the time required to deliver new features with data persistence, such as our most recent Luna New Year event.\n\nMatchmaking\n\nIn many competitive-style online games, matchmaking is the process of selecting people for a match. For Palia, matchmaking means matching the player with the game server that we believe will give players the best gameplay experience.\n\nThere are several dimensions that we take into consideration during matching:\n\nLocation - how far away the game server is from where the player is currently playing (because closer server means lower latency and lower latency means a more fluid and immersive experience)\n\nFriends - how many of the player’s friends are currently playing on that server (because the more people they know the more meaningful their interaction will be)\n\nPopulation - how many people are playing on that server (because the more people are playing the more alive the world feels)\n\nThe matchmaking system is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing us to add more signals to the matching algorithm over time if we desire.\n\nAnother crucial feature of the matchmaking system is the ability to distinguish “join” requests and “travel” requests. A join request happens when a player starts the game and wants to join. A travel request is a match required by a player leaving one map of the game and traveling to another.\n\nThe ability to distinguish the two allows us to offer priority to “travel” requests when the system is under load and there is high contention. This is because it’s far less disruptive for players to wait a few minutes to join and then wait only a few seconds to travel between maps, than one in which the delays are spread uniformly across all matching requests.\n\nThis screenshot shows a piece of the dashboard we use to monitor queue sizes and the distribution of times it takes for a matchmaking request (join or travel) to be satisfied.\n\nSpotlight: game-aware internal queueing and autoscaling\n\nEvery empty server running in the cloud without a player on it is a waste of money. On the other hand, there might be players who want to play and all of the game servers have their allocated slots filled so they would benefit from an empty server to land in.\n\nMany online games design “login queues” or similar ways to restrict the inbound flow of players and scale up or down the number of servers to meet the demand. Originally, this was our intent as well, but we realized we would benefit from a more sophisticated matchmaking design that could distinguish between joining and traveling. We also realized that the matchmaker had all the information it needed to control the size of the game server fleet.\n\nThis is how we came up with the Admiral: a component of the matchmaking system that oversees the fleet of game servers. The Admiral understands when the current fleet of game servers is insufficient to satisfy the number of players requesting a match and is able to ask the underlying cloud system (specifically Agones) to request the creation of more game server instances. Agones, on the other hand, is responsible for shutting down game servers that have been empty for some time.\n\nThe integration of autoscaling with matchmaking and the separation of concerns between the Admiral (scaling up) and Agones (scaling down) has served us very well and has managed to provide us with shock absorption to the game when things didn’t go as planned. Several times, the elasticity of these queues between maps have saved the team from having to bring down the game entirely to fix issues during misaligned deployments or unforeseen behaviors during load spikes.\n\nThis screenshot shows the view of the game servers fleet from the Admiral. Each line is really two lines: one for the “desired size” and another for the “actual size”. This information is used to tell the cloud orchestrator to spin up more game servers for a particular map type as they are needed by players being matched to servers that don’t yet exist.\n\nData Management\n\nOur architecture of loosely coupled software components wouldn’t be very useful without data flowing between them and being persisted, validated, or aggregated.\n\nDatabases\n\nOne of the most difficult elements of creating a shared perpetual world is constructing the ability for players to influence it (and one another) in a context that feels immediate and consistent. A key factor to provide a positive player experience is the choice of the database architecture.\n\nWe decided to use ScyllaDB as our main data persistence layer. ScyllaDB is a C++ rewrite of Apache Cassandra (originally created at Facebook and, in turn, heavily influenced by Google BigTable and Amazon DynamoDB), a distributed column store.\n\nThe biggest advantage of ScyllaDB for us has been its elastic scalability and its cloud native “design for failure” posture that aligned very well with ours. One significant advantage of ScyllaDB for us is the ability to attach replication strategy to a table but eventual consistency levels to a query. This gives us a lot of flexibility because in some cases we need consistency more than we need speed and we can tune that directly at the query level. This is not possible with traditional relational databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL.\n\nThis functionality is crucial, for example, when dealing with a persistent player state: we want the data to be replicated on multiple computers before we return a response to the game server. This means that both the game server and multiple database nodes have to die (at the very same time!) for that player state update to get lost. As far as we can tell, this has never happened.\n\nWe also use PostgreSQL (hosted for us by AWS) for the catalog of our outfits available for purchase in the game. We used a relational database here because we felt it was better suited for this particular job.\n\nAsynchronous Messaging\n\nAnother important part of the data management layer is the ability of software components to message one another asynchronously.\n\nWe have two of such busses:\n\nThe first for aggregates and collects telemetry for player behavior (which uses Apache Kafka, more on this later) and feeds our analytics and machine learning pipelines.\n\nAnother coordinates software components (for example, the control plane between the fleet auto-scaler and the game servers). This uses EMQX as the broker and MQTT as the protocol.\n\nWhy two? Mostly because they serve different purposes, have different strengths and weaknesses, and are managed by different teams focusing on separate outcomes. There might be value in consolidating things further in the future, but for now this separation is serving us well.\n\nSpotlight: MQTT and Apache ActiveMQ v5 (aka Artemis)\n\nThe use of MQTT as the message bus protocol for our game servers control planes was decided precisely to isolate us from lock-in of a particular broker implementation. In retrospect, this was a weak choice: MQTT is an IoT protocol and we were attracted by the fact that it was designed for devices with small power and low bandwidth. We wanted a solution that would be easy and cheap for the game servers to interact with and didn’t consume a lot of their resources.\n\nUnfortunately, many MQTT brokers simply implemented that protocol on top of their existing native systems. We picked Apache ActiveMQ v5 (aka Artemis) because it was established and it supported v5 of the MQTT protocol (which offered features we needed) but was written and designed before clouds existed and turned out to be incompatible with our preferred “loosely coupled components expected to fail” architectural posture.\n\nArtemis has been the source of much apprehension and tribulation. We ended up having to patch the software to fit our needs. We operated with a forked version in production just to keep it from falling over regularly (the MQTT layer and cross-regional federation layers did not work well together).\n\nWe have since migrated to EMQX which is a more modern MQTT broker, designed from the ground-up with MQTT in mind and we have not looked back.\n\nThe lesson learned here is that even established and battle-tested software might still end up performing poorly when utilized in a different context and with different operational constraints than was originally intended.\n\nData Pipelines\n\nAnother important principle of our software architecture is that we want to be able to observe and monitor how the system is behaving so that we can act on it effectively when behavior deviates from the norm.\n\nWe treat data differently based on whether the decision making that it supports is latency sensitive or not. In fact, we use completely different systems for low-latency decision support (seconds to minutes) vs. high-latency (days or weeks).\n\nSpotlight: player behavior vs. system behavior\n\nIn the past, we separated data based on whether it was about player behavior or software behavior. But we quickly realized that distinction was not very helpful in practice.\n\nFor example, a purchasing event from a player is technically a player behavior and insights gathered from them influence strategic decision making with high-latency (days or weeks). But such a high-latency reaction would be detrimental to both our players and our revenue if we didn’t get notified immediately if the frequency of purchases dropped outside of the normal range of operation.\n\nIt is generally true that data generated from the behavior of players influences decision making in aggregate and with high latency while events generated by the behavior of software systems influences decisions and actions that require quick reaction times. But our ability to route data based on decision making latency needs and not on the semantics of origin has made it easier to reason about data routing decisions, especially when the two pipelines are handled by different teams with different skills, strengths, and goals.\n\nObservability\n\nWe picked Prometheus as the time-series database powering the low-latency data pipeline and alerting. The key advantage here is the “pull” model in which it is Prometheus to “scrape” data from our software components, which makes it a lot simpler to maintain.\n\nWe also use Grafana as our visual dashboarding system querying the data stored in Prometheus along with Loki and Tempo to deal textual logs and tracing the flow of execution across several of our software components.\n\nLastly, we use Sloth to automate the generation of SLOs.\n\nAnalytics\n\nThe high-latency data pipeline revolves around Apache Kafka (managed for us by Confluent) which captures and routes the data as well as Apache Spark (managed for us by Databricks), which we use to aggregate and analyze the data.\n\nWe use Apache Airflow (managed for us by Astronomer) for monitoring and scheduling long-running workflows for data aggregation and analysis. Lastly, we use Tableau to power the visualization of the insights that result from our data analysis.\n\nCloud Infrastructure\n\nAnother development challenge is the “free-to-play” nature of our distribution strategy. This approach made it difficult to predict the amount of players that would play the game, especially around key events, such as platform launches, major updates, and in-game events.\n\nWe decided to be “cloud native” from the start because “elasticity” in supply of computation and bandwidth is a key advantage that cloud providers have over acquiring and maintaining our own server infrastructure; especially for gaming startups (for which capital is constrained) and when deploying across multiple geographical regions.\n\nCloud native for us didn’t simply mean: “run our programs on somebody else’s computer.” Cloud native for us meant designing a software architecture composed of small pieces that are loosely coupled and always expected to fail.\n\nWe call this “designing for failure.” Of course, we never want our systems to fail. However, we believe that resiliency in software systems comes less from preventing failure, and more from providing mitigations to such risks and the ability to restore service as quickly and automatically as possible. We want to design to reduce failure but we always expect it to happen, so when it does happen, our systems would not be surprised by it.\n\nKey components of this strategy were using Kubernetes as our orchestration system, Linkerd as our service mesh, Traefik as our load balancer and Agones to manage our fleet of game servers. We also rely heavily on the “infrastructure as code” principle, using Kustomize to help us keep our configurations DRY and ArgoCD to power continuous deployments.\n\nKubecost helps us measure costs, and we recently swapped from cluster-autoscaler to Karpenter to optimize cluster elasticity and to help pick the best server instances. This change allowed us to save a non-trivial percentage of our cloud costs by automating the selection of instance types to use to run our workloads.\n\nFor provisioning infrastructure we rely on Terraform and Spacelift. We rely on Vault to store secrets without our cloud environments. We also conduct chaos testing using Litmus.\n\nAnd we rely on a few different services for authentication and authorization systems, including FusionAuth for account management, Zendesk for customer support management, Stripe for payment processing, and Vivox for our in-game chat system.\n\nOur only cloud provider is Amazon Web Services which provides us computers, storage, and bandwidth across multiple regions: United States, Germany, and Japan. We also rely on Cloudflare for geo-aware DNS and load balancing as well as DDoS protection.\n\nSpotlight: Nomad vs. Kubernetes\n\nWe had originally chosen Nomad as our orchestration solution, mostly because it was perceived to be conceptually simpler and it was much more compatible with Windows workloads (which we thought we might need for testing purposes).\n\nUnfortunately, Nomad had one very significant problem: the momentum of the development community around it was significantly smaller than around Kubernetes. This had two significant issues for us: a) we had to develop in-house solutions that the community around Kubernetes had already implemented; and b) it was harder to engage the team with a technology that many considered an evolutionary dead-end.\n\nWe made the difficult call to switch our cloud orchestration system by using the argument that our development velocity would significantly improve and our operational risks would be reduced. This turned out to be very much the case and it’s a decision we would happily make again.\n\nBuild Systems\n\nThere are two primary concepts used in the building of Palia and its supporting services: the build platform and the build system. Historically, game studios lumped these two together around the primary continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) component. We borrowed some plays from large-scale build and release systems beyond gaming: using a heavily distributed approach inspired by some of our team members’ experiences in other industries, such as banking.\n\nTo power the build system we use Jenkins, but take care to draw a distinction between the software, and the underlying infrastructure upon which it runs and integrates. While related, these things are best served by intentional, separate configuration management and Infrastructure as Code practices which can quickly become unwieldy and complex if attempting to do so under a monolithic design. The result is a hybrid cloud approach to the build system. We use both an on-prem data center and Amazon Web Services, and one side of the architecture can be maintained without potentially negatively impacting the other.\n\nWe also took the time to redesign the initial version of the build system (Jenkins pipelines) around Unreal Engine’s native tooling, namely, BuildGraph. Doing so required a lot of work up-front as the old method was cobbled together between Jenkins Pipelines and Python scripts, but the declarative nature of BuildGraph tooling has allowed us to increase correctness, reduce build system maintenance, and increase flexibility such that we can build almost every target platform with minimal specific changes for each. A key component of this success was integrating with AutoSDK and creating a “standard library” of sorts in Jenkins to glue it all together.\n\nIn our latest version of the build platform we are able to mostly dynamically scale the number of executors based on demand. The build system can then simply act as a “glue layer” to distribute requested tasks among the available executors as parallel pipeline runs. Further, we’ve incorporated designing for Self-Service by other teams, such that they can “pick and choose” which artifacts they want built via a single interface. We call this the “Prime Pipeline,” which presents a series of configurable parameters and then schedules the running of “Sub-Pipelines” to do the work, passing those parameters as appropriate. This means that via the same Prime Pipeline interface, one Engineer could choose to build only one Platform Client from the library of Clients available, and one Server, getting only those two artifacts; or they could select everything and end up with every Client and Server we currently offer as targets.\n\nSpotlight: Capacity Management in a Hybrid Cloud World\n\nA trade-off we make for this level of granularity and distribution is the initial difficulty in managing capacity. We use several build executors of different types and had to really break-down our pipelines and how each stage would be distributed to the executors both on-prem and in AWS. Then we had to measure a single run of each pipeline to get more accurate numbers to use for calculating instance sizes, costs, expected load, and timings for stage and whole pipeline execution. This cost us a lot of time up-front, and while we are glad we did it, it is yet another piece of operational overhead which must be monitored, reviewed, and adjusted in order to remain reasonably accurate. Changing something as simple as the Node Label of a particular pipeline Stage can have serious impacts to all of the metrics we measure, most notably, build times. Unfortunately, there aren't a whole lot of “drop-in” or “off-the-shelf” solutions for these types of systems, so we have had to track these things manually, and then automate as we go to attempt to reduce the operational burden.\n\nFurthermore, managing two different sets of infrastructure is not for the faint of heart, or those unfamiliar with Hybrid Cloud management. While the patterns may be very similar, the implementation proved to be a lot more work than we anticipated.\n\nFor example, AWS and other cloud service providers make APIs available to interact on a very granular level with their exposed components. On the other end of the spectrum, even the most mature on-prem infrastructure providers rely on their own custom tooling for managing hardware components. This is why projects such as Ansible are in such heavy use in the IT industry, and S6 is no exception here as we prioritize the use of open source tools where possible to ease cognitive load and keep costs low.\n\nThe challenge that made this most difficult was the disparity in experience using this approach on our team members’ time. Some of us come from more of a Platforming background, others from a Tooling background, and still others from primarily a Jenkins Pipeline writing background. This is great for general cross-functionality within the team, but requires careful planning to execute well even among the highest-performing teams.\n\nVersion Control\n\nWe use two different version control systems to manage the development lifecycle of our code: Perforce for the game code, and git (hosted in Bitbucket) for everything else.\n\nUsing different version control systems is clearly suboptimal and not a decision we took lightly: git is generally preferred by backend engineers and is far better supported by modern development environments.\n\nUnfortunately, Perforce is very well integrated in Unreal Engine because that’s what Epic Games uses (the makers of Unreal Engine). Also, git isn’t really designed to work with very large binary files, and a lot of our in-game assets and original sources are giant binary files. Perforce works well in these situations.\n\nEarly on, we tried using git-lfs (large file storage), which is supposed to help with this problem but we gave up when we realized how much effort it would be to retrofit all of the Epic development tools (UnrealGameSync, for example) to work with git.\n\nWe sincerely wish we had a single consolidated version control system and code review workflow, but it is not a trivial exercise.\n\nSpotlight: Consolidated Repos\n\nOne of the issues we faced with git was that it was too easy and convenient to create new repositories, causing a proliferation of them. The biggest issue we faced was the inability to make changes that cross-cut different services at once. This created a lot of production overhead and reduced our ability to consolidate the behavior of services.\n\nWe considered switching to a full “monorepo” but many of us were unfamiliar with it and feared additional complexity and overhead that we had no additional development capacity to support.\n\nThe compromise we reached was a handful of consolidated repos in which many individual git repositories were merged into a single repository and then archived. All the microservices ended up in this single repository, but they could be developed, built, tested and deployed in isolation. This made it much easier to modify code across services (such as version dependencies) as well as simplifying the creation of libraries. This approach facilitated an incremental externalization of common functionality into modules that could be more easily reused across services, reducing copy/paste code duplication and reducing our maintenance costs.\n\nSaaS-y Open Source\n\nOne common theme you might have noticed in our architecture is that we prefer to depend on software that is open source and that we could host ourselves if we wanted/needed to. We also prefer to rely on a SaaS vendor that provides and manages this software for us instead of running it ourselves.\n\nThis offers us several advantages:\n\nWe are not locked into a particular cloud or vendor provider (as we could run the system ourselves if we needed to).\n\nWe can provision systems more quickly (our people don’t need to learn the intricacies of configuring them).\n\nLeverage vendor expertise to fix issues and/or edge cases when we encounter them.\n\nKeeps the vendor prices under control under our threat of shutting down our vendor contract and hosting the system ourselves.\n\nWe deviated from this posture only rarely and when there was no open source alternative that made sense for our business needs. However, we do believe this paradigm worked well for us and provides a way to fund and support further development of these open source projects. This, in turn, lowers our future risks by helping make the development of these open projects more sustainable (as these hosting vendors often employ contributors to the open source projects and continue to fund their contributions for mutually symbiotic benefit).\n\nConclusions\n\nIt’s rare to get access to the source code that makes up video games, so it’s rare to have the opportunity to learn directly from it. Even rarer is a view into the decisions and tradeoffs, the lessons learned, the paths not taken and those taken but with later regret.\n\nWe hope that this deep-dive on the challenges and successes of creating Palia’s software architecture provides some insight and inspiration for others facing similar challenges.\n\nIf you have any questions about Palia’s software architecture and development, or simply if you want to start a conversation feel free to reach out to us at hello@singularity6.com.\n\nSpecial Thanks\n\nThe list of people that contributed to this architecture is very long (see the Palia credits for the full list) and we wouldn’t do it justice to replicate it here.

Before using our Services, please ensure that you have read and understood the terms of this Privacy Notice. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, please discontinue the use of our Services immediately.\n\n1. What data do we collect and process?\n\nThe type of data we collect and process depends on how you interact with us and use our Services. Depending on your use of our Services, the personal information, as defined by applicable data protection laws, we may have collected and disclosed in the prior 12 months include:\n\nTechnical data: When you use our Services, we collect technical data in order to ensure the functionality and security of these offerings. This includes IPs, logs and other device data. To ensure the functionality of these offerings, we may also assign an individual code to you or your terminal device. When signing up, downloading, installing, and/or playing a game as part of the Services we provide, we process information from you and your device.\n\nRegistration data: Certain Services can only be used with a user account or registration, which can happen directly with us or through our third-party login service providers. In this regard you must provide us with certain data, and we may collect data about the use of such Services. We generate or collect this information when you voluntarily create an account to use our Services.\n\nCommunication data: When you contact us by any means of communication, we may collect the data exchanged between you and us, including your contact details and the metadata of the communication. Communications made using a product or Service should not be considered private. We may monitor and/or record your communications (including, without limitation, chat text) when you are using a product or Service to analyze for toxicity, prevent cheating and fraud, or enforce our End User License Agreement and/or terms of licensing. You can choose to not use these communication features. You acknowledge that you should not have an expectation of privacy concerning the transmission of any user generated content or communications, that we will monitor and record such content and/or communications as described in this Privacy Notice, and that you should avoid disclosing any personally identifiable information when using these communication features.\n\nMaster data: With master data we mean the basic data that we need, in addition to contract data (see below), for the performance of our contractual and other business relationships or for marketing and promotional purposes. We collect information when you interact with our customer service department. In certain cases, we may ask you to provide a copy of a document or government-issued ID to verify your identity, location, and/or account ownership. When photo identification is provided to us, we ask that you remove or hide any sensitive information and it is normally deleted as soon as the identification verification is complete or within other legally permissible limits.\n\nContract and Player data: This means data that is collected in relation to entering into or the performance of a contract, for example information about the contracts and the Services provided or to be provided, as well as data from the period leading up to the conclusion of a contract, information required or used for performing a contract, and information about feedback. We collect contact information when you create an account or use our Services to contact us. Data is also collected from in-game interactions such as player status information (e.g. online status, in-game location etc.). We generally collect this data from you, from contractual partners and from third parties involved in the performance of the contract, but may also collect from third-party sources and/or public sources as permissible.\n\nPreference data: Depending on our relationship with you, we may try to get to know you better and to tailor our products, services and offers to you. For this purpose, we may collect and process data about your preferences. Based on this data, we may, for example, determine if you are interested in certain services. The data processed for this purpose is already known to us (for example where and when you use our Services), or we may collect it by recording your behavior (for example how you navigate our websites). We collect browsing information automatically when you access our websites.\n\nSocial Media Information: We collect this information automatically when you share information through social media widgets on our Services. We also collect it when you voluntarily provide it to us.\n\nMuch of the data is provided to us by you (through forms, when you communicate with us, or when you use our Services). You are not obliged or required to disclose data to us, unless you choose to continue using our Services.\n\nAs far as it is lawful, we may also collect data from public sources (for example the media, or the internet including social media) or receive data from service providers and other third parties in connection with your use of our Services or your interactions with us on other platforms.\n\n2. For what purposes do we process your data?\n\nWe generally process your data for purposes related to communicating with you, including responding to inquiries or to help you exercise your rights. For this purpose, we may use communication data, master data, and registration data in relation to offers and Services that you use. We keep this data for purposes such as documenting our communication with you, training purposes, quality assurance, providing our Services and any associated support for them including follow-up inquiries.\n\nWe process data for the administration and performance of contractual relationships including providing you with Services like Palia game functionalities. We may also use data to manage alpha, beta, or other forms of playtests and collect feedback.\n\nWe process data for marketing purposes and relationship management, for example to send you personalized advertising for products and services from us, some of which may be offered in partnership with third parties. This may happen in the form of newsletters and other regular contacts, through other channels for which we have contact information from you, but also as part of marketing campaigns and may also include free services.\n\nWe further process your data for data analytics, market research, to improve our services and operations, and for product development to improve the Services we provide.\n\nWe may also process your data for security and access control purposes.\n\nWe process personal data to comply with laws, directives and recommendations from authorities and internal regulations.\n\nWe also process data for the purposes of our risk management and as part of our corporate governance, including business organization and development. We may process your data for further purposes, for example as part of our internal processes and administration or for quality assurance purposes and training.\n\n3. On what basis do we process your data?\n\nThe legal bases on which we process your personal data depend on the Services you use and how you interact with them. We may ask for your consent for certain processing activities. You may withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future by contacting us through the relevant Service . Once we have received notification of withdrawal of consent, we will promptly cease processing your information for the purpose(s) you consented to, unless we have another legal basis to continue doing so. Withdrawal of consent does not, however, affect the lawfulness of the processing based on the consent prior to withdrawal.\n\nWhere we do not seek consent for processing, the processing of your personal data relies on the requirement of the processing for initiating or performing a contract with you or on our legitimate interest in the particular processing. Our legitimate interests also include compliance with legal regulations, insofar as this is not already recognized as a legal basis by applicable data protection law. This also includes the marketing of our products and services, the interest in better understanding our markets and in managing and further developing Palia, our other Services, and Singularity 6, including its operations, safely and efficiently.\n\nWe may process your data on other legal bases, for example, in the event of a dispute, as required in relation to a potential litigation or for the enforcement or defense of legal claims. We will communicate to you separately as necessary where such other legal bases may apply.\n\n4. What applies in case of personalization?\n\nWe may automatically evaluate personal aspects relating to you, where we wish to determine preference data, but also to detect misuse and security risks, to perform statistical analysis or for operational planning. We may also create profiles for these purposes, i.e., we may combine behavioral and preference data, but also master data, contract data and technical data relating to you in order to better understand you as a person and your experiences with our game.\n\nIn this case, we pay attention to the proportionality and reliability of the results and take measures against misuse of these profiles. Where these can produce legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affect you, we ensure human review.\n\n5. How do we share your data?\n\nIn relation to our contracts, websites, products and all other Services, our legal obligations or otherwise with protecting our legitimate interests and the other purposes, we may disclose your personal data to different parties, including:\n\nService providers: We may work with service providers in the US, Europe and other regions who process your data on our behalf. This includes for example hosting services. We disclose personal information to these service providers for a business purpose as legally permissible.\n\nParties you Authorize, Access, or Authenticate: Third parties you access through the services, social media services you use or other users with whom you communicate. For example, we work with businesses such as Stripe, in which case we do not share personal data, but allow the players or visitors to share their personal data directly with these parties. We then receive transactional information from the business e.g., if the payment or age verification was successful.\n\nContractual partners: This refers to contractual partners we may enter into partnerships or other contractual relationships with. For example, they may receive pseudonymized or anonymized registration data in relation to issued and redeemed vouchers or invitations. These recipients may also include contractual partners with whom we cooperate or who carry out advertising for us and to whom we may therefore disclose anonymized or pseudonymized data about you for analysis and marketing purposes.\n\nAuthorities: We may disclose personal data to agencies, courts and other authorities in the US and abroad if we are legally obliged or entitled to make such disclosures or if it appears necessary to protect our interests.\n\nDisclosure in Merger, Sale or Other Asset Transfer: In the event of a reorganization, dissolution, merger, sale or bankruptcy, we may transfer any information we collect to relevant third parties and will obtain your consent to do so where required.\n\nOther persons: This means other cases where interactions with third parties follows from the purposes, for example service recipients, the media and associations in which we participate or if you are included in one of our publications.\n\nIn addition, we enable certain third parties to collect personal data from you on our website and in our Services. Where we have no control over these data collections, these third parties are sole controllers.\n\n6. Is your personal data disclosed abroad?\n\nWhen you use our Services or access our websites, we may collect personal data about you which may be transferred, processed and/or accessed by us in the United States or any other country in which we or our service providers operate.

How long do we retain your data?\n\nWe generally store and retain your data for as long as our processing purposes, legal retention periods and our legitimate interests in documentation and keeping evidence may require, or where storage is a technical requirement. When determining applicable retention periods, we consider multiple criteria including the minimum requirements under applicable law, applicable industry standards and whether the data is required to prevent fraud, cheating or other forms of misuse of our Services. If there are no contrary legal or contractual obligations requiring otherwise and there are no further purposes for processing the data, we will delete or anonymize your data once the retention period has expired as part of our usual processes.\n\n8. What are your rights?\n\nApplicable data protection laws grant you the right to object to the processing of your data in some circumstances, in particular for direct marketing purposes, for profiling carried out for direct marketing purposes and for other legitimate interests in processing.\n\nYou may have the following rights depending on the data protection law(s) applicable to you:\n\nThe right to request information from us as to whether and what data we process from you;\n\nThe right to have us correct your personal data if it is inaccurate;\n\nThe right to request deletion of your personal data;\n\nThe right to request that we provide certain personal data in a commonly used electronic format or transfer it to another controller;\n\nThe right to withdraw consent, where our processing is based on your consent;\n\nThe right to receive, upon request, further information that is helpful for the exercise of these rights;\n\nThe right to express your point of view in case of automated individual decisions and to request that the decision be reviewed by a human.\n\nIf you wish to exercise the above-mentioned rights or have any questions relating to those rights, please contact us. For us to be able to prevent misuse, we need to verify your identity.\n\nIf you are located in the EEA, the United Kingdom or in Switzerland, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent data protection supervisory authority in your country, but we would appreciate the opportunity to address any concerns you may have and kindly request that you direct your complaint to us first.\n\n9.

You can opt out of having your personal information shared for targeted advertising purposes and opt out of having your sensitive personal information shared.\n\nRight to Withdraw Consent.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent to our consent based data processing at any time.\n\nRight to Non-Discrimination.\n\nYou have the right not to be discriminated against by us for exercising the rights listed in this section.

      "# [How Singularity 6’s ‘Palia’ Conquered Cross-Regional Gaming with Amazon EKS and Karpenter on 2024-05-07](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/gametech/how-singularity-6s-palia-conquered-cross-regional-gaming-with-amazon-eks-and-karpenter/)\nIntroduction\n\nDeveloping an online multiplayer game capable of supporting thousands of concurrent players is an incredibly complex endeavor. For Singularity 6 (S6), creators of the hit game “Palia,” which released across platforms in 2023 and 2024—their developers needed to craft an immersive and captivating gaming experience while managing the vast resources and infrastructure required to keep the game’s services running smoothly.\n\nThroughout the development process, unforeseen obstacles and hurdles arose, testing the team’s resilience and problem-solving abilities. Furthermore, launching globally across console and PC platforms introduced an additional layer of intricacy, requiring planning and execution to ensure a seamless experience for players worldwide. To boost their small infrastructure team, S6 leveraged Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) and Karpenter’s flexibility and elasticity while minimizing cost—allowing Palia to reach over 3 million players in six months, in three different Regions, and across four distribution platforms.\n\nThis article describes the process the team at Singularity 6 used to make the Palia launch smooth and successful.\n\nOverview of Palia’s AWS infrastructure\n\nEarly on, Singularity 6 made the decision to host Palia on Amazon Web Services (AWS). As an online multiplayer game, the team understood that Palia needed a “cloud-first” approach. Today, Palia runs using Amazon EKS in three AWS Regions: US West (Oregon) – us-west-2, Asia Pacific (Tokyo) – ap-northeast-1, Europe (Frankfurt) – eu-central-1.\n\nPalia’s backend services run inside an EKS cluster, including the game servers powered by Unreal Engine. For persisting player state across a shared world, Palia relies on ScyllaDB as the database layer. ScyllaDB is highly scalable and designed from the start to be distributed and fast, trading speed for eventual consistency. Palia’s external traffic is routed through a geo-load balanced domain name system (DNS) address to a Network Load Balancer (NLB).\n\nReleasing Palia\n\nDuring Palia’s development, its cloud infrastructure was built entirely in a single datacenter: US West (Oregon). Singularity 6 knew that the studio would eventually need to release Palia in other Regions to reduce latency and improve the player experience. Load testing their system was also necessary to ensure a smooth rollout. Still, there was fear that there were not enough players in alpha tests to accurately simulate launch numbers.\n\nThe team used this opportunity to clone part of their production cloud infrastructure to Frankfurt. As the launch window approached, Palia released in the US first, while leveraging Frankfurt as their load and stress testing cluster, then ran a ScyllaDB copy to evaluate the latency of their queries across Regions on different continents. This “dark multiregional rollout” at the start greatly reduced risks when the game began operating in a multi-regional setting later as the S6 team could gather information on real player behavior.\n\nLoad testing\n\nBefore Palia had any players, Singularity 6 simulated them by writing load tests against their microservices using Locust. Their major focus was stress testing critical backend components, particularly ones that rely on other services to function. To generate sufficient load, S6 wrote a Locust test, ran it from within the Amazon EKS cluster, and then scaled it rapidly and effectively while gathering data that showed how the test systems responded. Using this method, the team identified inefficient code paths, balanced resource requests and limits, and tweaked auto scaling metrics.\n\nChaos testing with Litmus\n\nAfter Singularity 6 saw how their services responded to large volumes of requests, the team decided to inject some chaos into their tests. Their goal was to conduct experiments and observe how the rest of the system responded – especially for critical systems where an outage might cause a cascading failure. Using Litmus, S6 injected latency, created network isolation, and caused outages for specific services. Along the way, S6 constantly asked themselves, “Can we still play Palia?” Chaos testing helped build confidence because the team learned that once players were in-game, many types of chaos had little to no effect on them.\n\nRelease\n\nAhead of launch, Palia’s developers added and tested infrastructure to ensure they could match their player’s demands. Even with all their prep work, S6 encountered rough edges amid successes during their launch.\n\nIssue: Poor VPC planning\n\nWhen Singularity 6 started using Amazon EKS, the team already had a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) module written in Terraform. The module was not perfect, but S6 decided it was good enough to move forward without major changes. However, the team realized that this was the wrong decision within hours of launching Palia when an alert on pending pods revealed that the game had run out of IP addresses in its VPC’s subnets. S6 knew they could add additional subnets to the VPC, but didn’t notice any lines of code that might eventually cause issues in the EKS Terraform module.\n\nThe issue was they were concatenating all their private subnet IDs and public subnet IDs to the EKS cluster’s subnet IDs. When the team added new subnets to the VPC, they were also expanding the EKS cluster control plane onto these subnets. This caused issues when the cluster needed to upgrade or when a managed node group needed to roll its instances.\n\nIn summary, an initial lack of VPC planning led to a proliferation of many unique managed node groups in Singularity 6’s environment. This made it harder to make changes to the EKS cluster as the node groups changed. Below, Singularity 6 discusses how using Karpenter helped reduce their usage of managed node groups, which helped to solve this issue.\n\nSuccess: Templated resource requests and limits\n\nDuring the early ramp up, the team encountered an incident where a component of their Linkerd stack was impacted from running out of memory (OOM). Despite having multiple replicas of this component, they saw other side effects of the OOMKill pod shutdowns, which meant they needed to act quickly. Within a few minutes, the team identified the component being killed and they were able to patch the resource requests to higher limits.\n\nLuckily, S6 had accounted for this issue by adding templating in their Helm and Kustomize to account for setting resource requests and limits. An extra few hours of development work proved instrumental for patching the system while it was scaling and allowing for a smooth experience for their players.\n\nPost release: Adding new Regions\n\nAfter Palia’s release in US West (Oregon), the team finished their infrastructure in Frankfurt and started work to expand further in Tokyo. This was in preparation for Palia’s Nintendo Switch launch, which would bring in substantial new players from Asia. The team knew that providing game servers and services closer to their players would be instrumental to the game’s success, so getting Asia Pacific (Tokyo) online was a natural next step.\n\nIssue: Lack of instance diversity\n\nPalia’s backend, particularly the game servers, requires either a “many nodes with fewer vCPUs” or “fewer nodes with more vCPU” approach. In the Asia Pacific (Tokyo) Region, the team found that their preferred instance types had limited availability than either Oregon or Frankfurt. To solve for this, they decided to explore the use of Karpenter.\n\nSuccess: Using Kustomize for DRY configuration\n\nAdding new Regions revealed an obvious issue in their Gitops-style setup of ArgoCD. Namely, keeping their config (microservice version numbers, chart versions, resource requests and limits) in sync across multiple clusters.\n\nTo solve this, the team turned to Kustomize to further “customize” their DRY configurations and centralize changes such as bumping version numbers. Kustomize allowed S6 to define a single file that contained the version of both the game server and microservices. ArgoCD has excelled at noticing git repo changes and deploying updates to all regions.\n\nUsing Karpenter\n\nAt the end of October 2023, Karpenter moved to a beta readiness. At the time, Singularity 6 was using the cluster-autoscaler and formed several hypotheses that using Karpenter to manage their EKS instances closer to the control plane would provide several benefits, including:\n\nIt removed almost all of the managed node groups by reducing the burden of updating them as the cluster changed.\n\nIt granted the ability to quickly test additional instance configurations such as family, size, and architecture.\n\nIt allowed flexibility to easily adapt to Regions that lack a particular instance type.\n\nIt provided a more nuanced view of the cluster to start instances just-in-time and reduce their idle CPU.\n\nSuccess: Flexibility, experimentation, and idle costs\n\nInitially, Singularity 6 hypothesized that using Karpenter would give them flexibility across instance types, sizes, and even CPU architecture. For example, the team thought it would be straightforward to experiment running Palia on Graviton instances (with ARM processors) without any Terraform changes to managed node groups. Karpenter also streamlined issues with instance constraints in a Region like Tokyo. Finally, by configuring Karpenter to use varied instance sizes and families, S6 was able to run a cluster without any of the overhead of multiple Terraform-defined managed node groups.\n\nUsing Karpenter with its NodePool resource resulted in a reduction of idle game servers in their clusters. By configuring a more diverse set of instances, Singularity 6 was able to decrease idle cost by 75%.\n\nSuccess: Karpenter accelerates Kubernetes upgrades\n\nSwitching to Karpenter removed the need for almost all of their managed node groups. They no longer had an EKS cluster with hundreds of instances across several managed node groups. This simplification, as well as using control_plane_subnet_ids, allowed the team to more easily upgrade their EKS clusters to newer versions of Kubernetes. With fewer instances to launch and less “node group overhead” in their Terraform module, S6 was able to upgrade from K8s v1.26 to v1.28 across six EKS clusters in a few hours.\n\nConclusion\n\nFrom the player’s perspective, Palia’s PC launch went smoothly. The team performed load testing and chaos testing, which ensured the systems scaled properly. The elasticity of AWS offerings proved invaluable for this as they were able to double server capacity from 25 to 50 EC2 instances within hours across multiple Regions. Despite Singularity 6’s best efforts, they still ran into issues due to design choices made very early on.\n\nFollowing Palia’s PC release, Singularity 6’s choice to focus on improving Terraform, Kustomize, and Karpenter, allowed them to rapidly add new Regions to the game and to improve their launch on Nintendo Switch. Again, AWS availability in multiple Regions allowed the team to move from a single Region to a world-wide infrastructure in a matter of months. Moreover, by moving configuration out of Terraform and EKS and into Karpenter, they were able to adapt to resource constraints and more quickly conduct experiments.\n\nIf you are curious about more details about the Palia software architecture, head over to the Singularity 6 blog for a more in-depth overview of this topic.\n\nA special thank you to the Singularity 6 team who contributed to this architecture and blog post: Emily Price, Kyle Allan, Marc Tamsky, Matthew Walter, George Lin, Alec Nunn, Maciej Ciezki, Brian Tomlinson, and Stefano Mazzocchi.",

      "# [Palia’s black market card game is causing player arguments by Cass Marshall on 2024-07-25](https://www.polygon.com/24206154/palia-hot-pot-card-game-arguments)\nLately, there’s been a strangely hostile underbelly in super cozy life sim Palia — and I’m not talking about the hidden cartel gambling pit under the inn. Developer Singularity 6 recently added a cute and simple card game for players to enjoy, called Hot Pot. What should have been another fun diversion in the Stardew Valley-style game has instead revealed a split in the player base.\n\nPalia takes place in the cozy Kilima Village, where players can hang out with the townsfolk, farm, cook, or head out and explore the nearby bustling Bahari Bay. At night, an underground market opens up under the town store. The shopkeep, a cheerful cat-man smuggler, runs the night market from 6 p.m. to 3 a.m.\n\nHere, players can find fancy new toilets, rugs, and paintings for sale, or fish with friends. The main attraction, though, is playing the Hot Pot card game. Playing awards one coin, winning grants two, and after the games wrap up players can queue to spend their coins at a prize wheel. One spin of the wheel costs two coins, and players can win high-end cooking ingredients, adorable plushies, or cool pirate decor.\n\nMany players like to enjoy the underground market as a chill social stop. After hunting in Bahari or talking with all the villagers in Kilima, it can be nice to unwind with a little Hot Pot. The minigame isn’t particularly demanding or competitive; you go around a table of four, trading tiles, until one player has collected three sets of three matching tiles.\n\nA certain faction of players prefers to play “fast” games, though, going around the table as quickly as possible. When one player is about to win, they call out the card they need, and someone else at the table trades it in. This style of play is designed to produce as many coins as possible. If people are sharing tiles, there are no prolonged end-game standoffs, and everyone earns more coins. And when one fast table sets up, and starts filling the chat near the tables with callouts, it can lead to a fight.\n\nOver the past few days, I’ve had multiple sessions of Hot Pot be interrupted by neighboring tables breaking out into arguments. The dialogue usually boils down to “Hey, you’re cheating!” and “No, we’re working together.” Of course, having a public argument is unproductive at the best of times; having one in an online game where everyone is subjected to the back-and-forth due to proximity chat rarely goes well. Everyone in Palia is polite on the surface, during daylight. But at night, fast table debates can break out, and next thing you know the chat is filled with accusations and unsavory insults.\n\nThis argument is part of the tension of Palia; it’s an online sandbox that’s meant to sustain a community, but it’s also a very chill and low-key experience that’s often best enjoyed solo. Most of the time, this works, and the player base is very well behaved. After Hot Pot games, players will line up to spend their coins and spin the wheel, and it’s considered a faux pas to run up and join a game at a table with four players already there. But the fast table debate has broken down the usual etiquette and civility, and I’m curious to see how — or if — Singularity 6 tackles these clashing priorities between players.",

However, despite a myriad of updated content added in time for the latest platform addition in Palia’s repertoire, the reviews remain firmly seated in the ‘mixed’ category.\n\nPatch 0.178 has bloomed (pun intended), and now Palia players can gather flower seeds by capturing bugs, attempt to conquer the Temple of the Roots, finally get their hands on the remaining Emberborn furniture pieces, and even pretend to get married in Bride and Groom attire.\n\nThough the biggest news to come out of Patch 0.178 and Palia’s Steam debut is the massive — both literally and figuratively — Frogbert. This plush grew to this gargantuan size thanks to a huge number of people adding Palia to their wishlist on Steam prior to release and will now be waiting for anyone who plays, new and veteran players alike.\n\nHowever, there is a dark cloud looming over the Steam release of Palia with the accompanying mixed reviews. The feedback comes from new and old players alike, but the biggest stand-out complaints include:\n\nOverpriced Premium Store items, with one bundle of purely cosmetic items costing more than major new releases and no way to earn cosmetic items in-game\n\nLack of ability to link Palia and Steam accounts if you’ve already opened the game, losing any progress made on other platforms permanently\n\nUpdates launched too quickly, many of which have rendered a previously functioning feature completely broken\n\nSevere lack of end-game content, despite the countless updates that have been received\n\nGame not advertised as beta or early access on Steam, despite this status never officially being dropped by developers\n\nFor an MMO, there is a severe lack of multiplayer content (unless you enjoy cooking)\n\nThese are just a few of the most prominent complaints that are coming up time and again in the review section of the Palia store page on Steam, and having spent over 200 hours in the game myself, I have to admit that I can see where they’re coming from.\n\nThese are the same issues that caused me to stop playing two months into the open beta. And although I rushed to download the game on Steam, hoping to try the numerous updates and hotfixes implemented, the negative reviews coupled with my own less-than-enjoyable experience with the game mean it’s going to sit in my library unplayed for a good while yet.",

Enjoy!\n\n**ALL SMUT CHAPTERS WILL BE MARKED WITH [X]!!!***\n\n“You probably can’t relate to this ‘cause you’ve never, y’know, fallen out of a portal or whatever but it’s been a little hard. I’m this weird grown adult who has to learn how to do all this basic stuff that comes so naturally to everybody, even kids! It’s embarrassing.”\n\nHodari tilted his head side to side as he contemplated your words. Finally, he leaned back on his hands and turned to face you, gaze freezing you in place.\n\n“You think too highly of yourself.”\n\n----\n\nOR: the one where PC finds out that they aren't as alone as they claim to be.\n\nSo, someone in the official Palia discord put up a Sketch-tember prompt list (September 2023). I saw it and decided that since I can't draw to save my life, I'm going to write instead. I'm currently behind on the list because life and ADHD brain not letting me, but I will catch up asap.\n\nSingularity 6 owns Palia and all associated characters. It's currently in Open Beta, but I hope you will try it out and enjoy it! I know I love how cozy and relaxing it is (for the most part)\n\nThese are all unbeta'd and any characters being, well, out of character, is all on me. I hope you enjoy reading them as much as I have writing them!\n\nThese are all relatively short vignettes, so you should go through them pretty fast :)",
