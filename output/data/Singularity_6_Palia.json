      "# [Palia Community Demonstrates Player Excitement and Appeal of New IP](https://www.singularity6.com/news/palia-community-excitement)\nWe're pleased to share that Palia is showing significant momentum with strong community engagement numbers, including more than 600,000 signups, that demonstrate the growing appetite for an elevated cozy sim experience among a mainstream audience.\n\nWhen revealed in June 2021, Palia was instantly embraced by both core and casual gaming audiences. Within 3 months of the title reveal, more than 600,000 players filled out a survey to playtest the game, outpacing the number of followers of Steam’s most Wishlisted games. An impressive feat for a product still in development (if we don't say so ourselves!), demonstrating a strong desire from players for the type of meaningful online game experience that we're creating.\n\nWe're intentionally building Palia alongside players, as part of the studio’s approach to game development, so that S6 can respond to the community and make improvements at every stage, and over time. Even in the earliest phases of development, the studio cultivated a highly-engaged community that has grown to more than 100,000 Discord members. Additionally, we welcomed nearly 20,000 players across several Alpha tests in 2022 and 2023. In a single Alpha window, players logged more than 167,000 hours in a month, with top players averaging about 200 hours (!!!) of playtime.\n\nOur team is developing Palia to feel welcoming, playful and friendly, which resonated strongly with early adopters looking for a sense of community, acceptance and belonging. By having strong foundations in place for its community from the outset, Singularity 6 has built trust and respect with these early adopters, who continue to help shape the game and have become evangelists for its growing community.\n\nWe look forward to sharing more information about Palia and our amazing community in the future!",

      "# [The Software Architecture of Palia](https://www.singularity6.com/news/software-architecture-of-palia)\nSingularity6’s debut game, Palia, is a free-to-play cozy online multiplayer community simulator. A place where players can play alone or with their friends to experience a beautiful and welcoming world which can be explored and personalized.\n\nSocial interaction and a persistent shared world are key features of the game. But these elements are also some of the most challenging to implement, scale, distribute geographically, and operate at minimal operational cost and negative player impact.\n\nPlayers experience the art and soul that our development team has poured into the game, but the infrastructure that makes it all possible behind the scenes is hidden from view. We are proud of what our team has accomplished with Palia, and we want to spotlight the studio’s hard work, including what players don’t experience directly. We also want to share some important lessons learned during our journey; we hope that sharing the lessons learned while developing Palia can be useful to others facing similar challenges.\n\nNow follow us behind the scenes of our Palia development journey!\n\nGame Engine\n\nBuilding an online multiplayer title from scratch benefits from a robust and proven game engine. We made the choice to build Palia using Unreal Engine. Unreal gives us powerful tools to build with out of the box, such as a strong networking and replication library to build social features, a graphics pipeline to build a beautiful world, a powerful physics engine that can simulate complex environments, and so much more. We use Unreal Engine for our game servers as well as our client, which gives players a real-time interactive environment.\n\nEach instance of the game server currently hosts up to 25 players, and we split up each server by what we call a map. These can be permanent fixtures, including our central hub Kilima Village, or even temporary available experiences, such as our Maji Market, which was only available for one month during our Luna New Year in-game event. When players travel between maps in Palia, the game client disconnects from one server and connects to a new one. We will share more details on how this works in our matchmaking service deep dive section.\n\nThis synergistic model is crucial for our team: we can develop most of the logic for Palia inside the engine and deploy to both clients and servers. This allows anyone on the team to test both the game and the game server in editor mode, which has been critical for our development velocity.\n\nSpotlight: memory leakage\n\nUnreal Engine servers are commonly used in “session-based games,” such as Fortnite: games that start and end within a certain amount of time. Memory leakage is not a big concern for session-based games because a new server is spun up for a new match and destroyed when the match ends. Any leaked memory will be cleaned before the next batch of players begin playing.\n\nPalia is a persistent shared-world game and the lifespan of our game servers is variable depending on how players move through the game world. A single game server may remain online and serve players for an entire patch cycle which could be weeks. Memory leakage which is cleaned up regularly for a session-based game can grow and compound, and small leaks might end up consuming two or even four times the amount of Random Access Memory (RAM) proportionally affecting our operational costs.\n\nTo combat this issue, we invested in solutions to help us identify memory leaks, and we spent useful time designing nudges for players to travel between maps as to increase the likelihood that a server would empty out and be shut down.\n\nUnexpectedly and fortunately, increasing geographical distribution helped with this problem: hosting servers near players not only helps with latency (because it reduces the distance that signals need to travel); but also with rotating empty servers because players tend to play at the same times, making it rare that somebody in that region is playing in the middle of the night and increasing the probability of servers to become empty, shut down, and cleaned.\n\nThis screenshot from one of our monitoring dashboards shows the memory usage of a portion of our game servers over a24h period in Feb 2024. The trend of linear memory increase is clearly visible.\n\nServices\n\nThe game client and servers talk to our services for specific actions, such as logging players into the game, loading characters, saving progress, sending chat messages to other players, making purchased outfits are stored in the player’s closet and many more.\n\nWe loosely follow a “microservice” posture, in which we prefer to host many different services specialized on one player feature.\n\nWe use HTTP as the North/South protocol (in and out of the datacenter) while we use gRPC for East/West communication (for services talking to each other inside the datacenter).\n\nWe use Rust exclusively as the programming language for our services and we try to include both integration and load testing as part of the definition of “done” for key services, including matchmaking, player presence and player state persistence which represent the largest percentage of our request load.\n\nOur unit and integration tests are also written in Rust, but we use Locust to support and execute our load tests. Locust load tests are written in Python which is simpler to program. The ability to quickly write and modify load tests was beneficial to us and sped up adoption.\n\nSpotlight: Rust for Microservices\n\nRust is a beloved programming language by many systems programmers because it provides state-of-the-art protection against common software vulnerabilities (buffer overflows and race conditions, for example) without introducing any performance penalties.\n\nRust is also a modern programming language. It is surrounded by a diverse and vibrant community of contributors and a wide range of libraries and tools. Documentation is excellent (especially onboarding tutorials) and the compiler is surely one of the most helpful and user-friendly.\n\nOf course, no programming language is perfect. Rust's posture is heavily focused on correctness, which is generally beneficial, but comes with a significant upfront cost which is visible in our development velocity. Rust makes it very hard to “cut corners” and punt hardening for later. It is a very good quality when something that was supposed to be just a prototype becomes load bearing in production by sheer pressure of business needs, but it makes it hard to move quickly and with agility around shifting requirements (which is a constant in startups and game development).\n\nThe other issue was hiring and onboarding. Rust’s relative youth as a programming language makes it somewhat difficult to hire people that have production experience with the language. Although the language is very popular, few people have used Rust in a professional team setting. Most people who have Rust experience have only used it for personal projects. With this in mind, onboarding took much longer than we expected. We factored 90 days to get engineers up to speed, but it turned out to take at least 6 months for most of the team to get comfortable and confident with the language.\n\nWe are very happy with the performance, latency, scalability, robustness and security of our Rust services. But there are moments when we wonder how much opportunity cost was spent in forcing up-front solidity of every piece of this layer.\n\nWe consider it an advantage for the studio to have managed to amortize those onboarding costs and the maintenance costs of our services is indeed very low, but those thinking of following our footsteps down the Rust path, should be willing to allocate a significant effort to education and onboarding. These costs will likely reduce over time as Rust becomes more popular in production settings, but it’s unclear what that rate will be.\n\nSeveral of our services are interesting and sophisticated enough to merit more attention: player state management and matchmaking.\n\nPlayer State Management\n\nWe consider player state all the information that a game server needs to recreate the most recent game world experienced by the player. The architecture of our game is server-authoritative which means that game servers decide the state of the world and act as referees when game clients report inconsistent data (for example, because of time delay in transmission). We took this route because Palia is a social game so a player cheating or modifying their state could have a negative impact on the experience of other players. The risk of cheating is reduced when it's our system that ultimately controls player state.\n\nThe simplest way to persist state is to wait until a player exits a game server and have the server send this information to the database. Unfortunately, this makes state changes in that server vulnerable to the server itself crashing and losing that data (which is only kept in volatile memory for performance reasons). Instead, several times a second we check for player state changes, and if there are any, that data is immediately queued and sent to the database to be persisted.\n\nSpotlight: data first vs. schema first\n\nA source of contention around player state is the modeling lifecycle: who and what decides what is valid to be stored into such a state? Traditional data-modeling techniques suggest a “schema first” approach: the structure of the data (the schema) is created ahead of time and then only data that conforms to that structure can be saved into the database.\n\nThis has the advantage that the database validates the shape of the data. The disadvantage is that one has to know ahead of time the structure of the data needed… which can be challenging to coordinate across different teams.\n\nTo increase the ease with which game engineers and technical designers could work, we decided on a different model in which the structure of the data would be decided in C++ structs directly within Unreal and then marshaled and persisted in the database as a binary blob (using the Flexbuffer format). The schema is the struct declaration itself and we use Unreal’s runtime type reflection system to export the schema to our database.\n\nThe advantage of this architectural choice is that it enabled game engineers to develop features that required state persistence without the need for constant coordination. The downside is that the data is opaque to the database, which is more expensive to keep uniform and consolidated. This has required us to invest in additional tooling around the player state management system to validate, backup, modify and correct player state when it diverges from the expected structure.\n\nDespite the additional layer of development investment needed to provide hardening on top of what the database normally provides, we believe this architecture has significantly cut down the time required to deliver new features with data persistence, such as our most recent Luna New Year event.\n\nMatchmaking\n\nIn many competitive-style online games, matchmaking is the process of selecting people for a match. For Palia, matchmaking means matching the player with the game server that we believe will give players the best gameplay experience.\n\nThere are several dimensions that we take into consideration during matching:\n\nLocation - how far away the game server is from where the player is currently playing (because closer server means lower latency and lower latency means a more fluid and immersive experience)\n\nFriends - how many of the player’s friends are currently playing on that server (because the more people they know the more meaningful their interaction will be)\n\nPopulation - how many people are playing on that server (because the more people are playing the more alive the world feels)\n\nThe matchmaking system is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing us to add more signals to the matching algorithm over time if we desire.\n\nAnother crucial feature of the matchmaking system is the ability to distinguish “join” requests and “travel” requests. A join request happens when a player starts the game and wants to join. A travel request is a match required by a player leaving one map of the game and traveling to another.\n\nThe ability to distinguish the two allows us to offer priority to “travel” requests when the system is under load and there is high contention. This is because it’s far less disruptive for players to wait a few minutes to join and then wait only a few seconds to travel between maps, than one in which the delays are spread uniformly across all matching requests.\n\nThis screenshot shows a piece of the dashboard we use to monitor queue sizes and the distribution of times it takes for a matchmaking request (join or travel) to be satisfied.\n\nSpotlight: game-aware internal queueing and autoscaling\n\nEvery empty server running in the cloud without a player on it is a waste of money. On the other hand, there might be players who want to play and all of the game servers have their allocated slots filled so they would benefit from an empty server to land in.\n\nMany online games design “login queues” or similar ways to restrict the inbound flow of players and scale up or down the number of servers to meet the demand. Originally, this was our intent as well, but we realized we would benefit from a more sophisticated matchmaking design that could distinguish between joining and traveling. We also realized that the matchmaker had all the information it needed to control the size of the game server fleet.\n\nThis is how we came up with the Admiral: a component of the matchmaking system that oversees the fleet of game servers. The Admiral understands when the current fleet of game servers is insufficient to satisfy the number of players requesting a match and is able to ask the underlying cloud system (specifically Agones) to request the creation of more game server instances. Agones, on the other hand, is responsible for shutting down game servers that have been empty for some time.\n\nThe integration of autoscaling with matchmaking and the separation of concerns between the Admiral (scaling up) and Agones (scaling down) has served us very well and has managed to provide us with shock absorption to the game when things didn’t go as planned. Several times, the elasticity of these queues between maps have saved the team from having to bring down the game entirely to fix issues during misaligned deployments or unforeseen behaviors during load spikes.\n\nThis screenshot shows the view of the game servers fleet from the Admiral. Each line is really two lines: one for the “desired size” and another for the “actual size”. This information is used to tell the cloud orchestrator to spin up more game servers for a particular map type as they are needed by players being matched to servers that don’t yet exist.\n\nData Management\n\nOur architecture of loosely coupled software components wouldn’t be very useful without data flowing between them and being persisted, validated, or aggregated.\n\nDatabases\n\nOne of the most difficult elements of creating a shared perpetual world is constructing the ability for players to influence it (and one another) in a context that feels immediate and consistent. A key factor to provide a positive player experience is the choice of the database architecture.\n\nWe decided to use ScyllaDB as our main data persistence layer. ScyllaDB is a C++ rewrite of Apache Cassandra (originally created at Facebook and, in turn, heavily influenced by Google BigTable and Amazon DynamoDB), a distributed column store.\n\nThe biggest advantage of ScyllaDB for us has been its elastic scalability and its cloud native “design for failure” posture that aligned very well with ours. One significant advantage of ScyllaDB for us is the ability to attach replication strategy to a table but eventual consistency levels to a query. This gives us a lot of flexibility because in some cases we need consistency more than we need speed and we can tune that directly at the query level. This is not possible with traditional relational databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL.\n\nThis functionality is crucial, for example, when dealing with a persistent player state: we want the data to be replicated on multiple computers before we return a response to the game server. This means that both the game server and multiple database nodes have to die (at the very same time!) for that player state update to get lost. As far as we can tell, this has never happened.\n\nWe also use PostgreSQL (hosted for us by AWS) for the catalog of our outfits available for purchase in the game. We used a relational database here because we felt it was better suited for this particular job.\n\nAsynchronous Messaging\n\nAnother important part of the data management layer is the ability of software components to message one another asynchronously.\n\nWe have two of such busses:\n\nThe first for aggregates and collects telemetry for player behavior (which uses Apache Kafka, more on this later) and feeds our analytics and machine learning pipelines.\n\nAnother coordinates software components (for example, the control plane between the fleet auto-scaler and the game servers). This uses EMQX as the broker and MQTT as the protocol.\n\nWhy two? Mostly because they serve different purposes, have different strengths and weaknesses, and are managed by different teams focusing on separate outcomes. There might be value in consolidating things further in the future, but for now this separation is serving us well.\n\nSpotlight: MQTT and Apache ActiveMQ v5 (aka Artemis)\n\nThe use of MQTT as the message bus protocol for our game servers control planes was decided precisely to isolate us from lock-in of a particular broker implementation. In retrospect, this was a weak choice: MQTT is an IoT protocol and we were attracted by the fact that it was designed for devices with small power and low bandwidth. We wanted a solution that would be easy and cheap for the game servers to interact with and didn’t consume a lot of their resources.\n\nUnfortunately, many MQTT brokers simply implemented that protocol on top of their existing native systems. We picked Apache ActiveMQ v5 (aka Artemis) because it was established and it supported v5 of the MQTT protocol (which offered features we needed) but was written and designed before clouds existed and turned out to be incompatible with our preferred “loosely coupled components expected to fail” architectural posture.\n\nArtemis has been the source of much apprehension and tribulation. We ended up having to patch the software to fit our needs. We operated with a forked version in production just to keep it from falling over regularly (the MQTT layer and cross-regional federation layers did not work well together).\n\nWe have since migrated to EMQX which is a more modern MQTT broker, designed from the ground-up with MQTT in mind and we have not looked back.\n\nThe lesson learned here is that even established and battle-tested software might still end up performing poorly when utilized in a different context and with different operational constraints than was originally intended.\n\nData Pipelines\n\nAnother important principle of our software architecture is that we want to be able to observe and monitor how the system is behaving so that we can act on it effectively when behavior deviates from the norm.\n\nWe treat data differently based on whether the decision making that it supports is latency sensitive or not. In fact, we use completely different systems for low-latency decision support (seconds to minutes) vs. high-latency (days or weeks).\n\nSpotlight: player behavior vs. system behavior\n\nIn the past, we separated data based on whether it was about player behavior or software behavior. But we quickly realized that distinction was not very helpful in practice.\n\nFor example, a purchasing event from a player is technically a player behavior and insights gathered from them influence strategic decision making with high-latency (days or weeks). But such a high-latency reaction would be detrimental to both our players and our revenue if we didn’t get notified immediately if the frequency of purchases dropped outside of the normal range of operation.\n\nIt is generally true that data generated from the behavior of players influences decision making in aggregate and with high latency while events generated by the behavior of software systems influences decisions and actions that require quick reaction times. But our ability to route data based on decision making latency needs and not on the semantics of origin has made it easier to reason about data routing decisions, especially when the two pipelines are handled by different teams with different skills, strengths, and goals.\n\nObservability\n\nWe picked Prometheus as the time-series database powering the low-latency data pipeline and alerting. The key advantage here is the “pull” model in which it is Prometheus to “scrape” data from our software components, which makes it a lot simpler to maintain.\n\nWe also use Grafana as our visual dashboarding system querying the data stored in Prometheus along with Loki and Tempo to deal textual logs and tracing the flow of execution across several of our software components.\n\nLastly, we use Sloth to automate the generation of SLOs.\n\nAnalytics\n\nThe high-latency data pipeline revolves around Apache Kafka (managed for us by Confluent) which captures and routes the data as well as Apache Spark (managed for us by Databricks), which we use to aggregate and analyze the data.\n\nWe use Apache Airflow (managed for us by Astronomer) for monitoring and scheduling long-running workflows for data aggregation and analysis. Lastly, we use Tableau to power the visualization of the insights that result from our data analysis.\n\nCloud Infrastructure\n\nAnother development challenge is the “free-to-play” nature of our distribution strategy. This approach made it difficult to predict the amount of players that would play the game, especially around key events, such as platform launches, major updates, and in-game events.\n\nWe decided to be “cloud native” from the start because “elasticity” in supply of computation and bandwidth is a key advantage that cloud providers have over acquiring and maintaining our own server infrastructure; especially for gaming startups (for which capital is constrained) and when deploying across multiple geographical regions.\n\nCloud native for us didn’t simply mean: “run our programs on somebody else’s computer.” Cloud native for us meant designing a software architecture composed of small pieces that are loosely coupled and always expected to fail.\n\nWe call this “designing for failure.” Of course, we never want our systems to fail. However, we believe that resiliency in software systems comes less from preventing failure, and more from providing mitigations to such risks and the ability to restore service as quickly and automatically as possible. We want to design to reduce failure but we always expect it to happen, so when it does happen, our systems would not be surprised by it.\n\nKey components of this strategy were using Kubernetes as our orchestration system, Linkerd as our service mesh, Traefik as our load balancer and Agones to manage our fleet of game servers. We also rely heavily on the “infrastructure as code” principle, using Kustomize to help us keep our configurations DRY and ArgoCD to power continuous deployments.\n\nKubecost helps us measure costs, and we recently swapped from cluster-autoscaler to Karpenter to optimize cluster elasticity and to help pick the best server instances. This change allowed us to save a non-trivial percentage of our cloud costs by automating the selection of instance types to use to run our workloads.\n\nFor provisioning infrastructure we rely on Terraform and Spacelift. We rely on Vault to store secrets without our cloud environments. We also conduct chaos testing using Litmus.\n\nAnd we rely on a few different services for authentication and authorization systems, including FusionAuth for account management, Zendesk for customer support management, Stripe for payment processing, and Vivox for our in-game chat system.\n\nOur only cloud provider is Amazon Web Services which provides us computers, storage, and bandwidth across multiple regions: United States, Germany, and Japan. We also rely on Cloudflare for geo-aware DNS and load balancing as well as DDoS protection.\n\nSpotlight: Nomad vs. Kubernetes\n\nWe had originally chosen Nomad as our orchestration solution, mostly because it was perceived to be conceptually simpler and it was much more compatible with Windows workloads (which we thought we might need for testing purposes).\n\nUnfortunately, Nomad had one very significant problem: the momentum of the development community around it was significantly smaller than around Kubernetes. This had two significant issues for us: a) we had to develop in-house solutions that the community around Kubernetes had already implemented; and b) it was harder to engage the team with a technology that many considered an evolutionary dead-end.\n\nWe made the difficult call to switch our cloud orchestration system by using the argument that our development velocity would significantly improve and our operational risks would be reduced. This turned out to be very much the case and it’s a decision we would happily make again.\n\nBuild Systems\n\nThere are two primary concepts used in the building of Palia and its supporting services: the build platform and the build system. Historically, game studios lumped these two together around the primary continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) component. We borrowed some plays from large-scale build and release systems beyond gaming: using a heavily distributed approach inspired by some of our team members’ experiences in other industries, such as banking.\n\nTo power the build system we use Jenkins, but take care to draw a distinction between the software, and the underlying infrastructure upon which it runs and integrates. While related, these things are best served by intentional, separate configuration management and Infrastructure as Code practices which can quickly become unwieldy and complex if attempting to do so under a monolithic design. The result is a hybrid cloud approach to the build system. We use both an on-prem data center and Amazon Web Services, and one side of the architecture can be maintained without potentially negatively impacting the other.\n\nWe also took the time to redesign the initial version of the build system (Jenkins pipelines) around Unreal Engine’s native tooling, namely, BuildGraph. Doing so required a lot of work up-front as the old method was cobbled together between Jenkins Pipelines and Python scripts, but the declarative nature of BuildGraph tooling has allowed us to increase correctness, reduce build system maintenance, and increase flexibility such that we can build almost every target platform with minimal specific changes for each. A key component of this success was integrating with AutoSDK and creating a “standard library” of sorts in Jenkins to glue it all together.\n\nIn our latest version of the build platform we are able to mostly dynamically scale the number of executors based on demand. The build system can then simply act as a “glue layer” to distribute requested tasks among the available executors as parallel pipeline runs. Further, we’ve incorporated designing for Self-Service by other teams, such that they can “pick and choose” which artifacts they want built via a single interface. We call this the “Prime Pipeline,” which presents a series of configurable parameters and then schedules the running of “Sub-Pipelines” to do the work, passing those parameters as appropriate. This means that via the same Prime Pipeline interface, one Engineer could choose to build only one Platform Client from the library of Clients available, and one Server, getting only those two artifacts; or they could select everything and end up with every Client and Server we currently offer as targets.\n\nSpotlight: Capacity Management in a Hybrid Cloud World\n\nA trade-off we make for this level of granularity and distribution is the initial difficulty in managing capacity. We use several build executors of different types and had to really break-down our pipelines and how each stage would be distributed to the executors both on-prem and in AWS. Then we had to measure a single run of each pipeline to get more accurate numbers to use for calculating instance sizes, costs, expected load, and timings for stage and whole pipeline execution. This cost us a lot of time up-front, and while we are glad we did it, it is yet another piece of operational overhead which must be monitored, reviewed, and adjusted in order to remain reasonably accurate. Changing something as simple as the Node Label of a particular pipeline Stage can have serious impacts to all of the metrics we measure, most notably, build times. Unfortunately, there aren't a whole lot of “drop-in” or “off-the-shelf” solutions for these types of systems, so we have had to track these things manually, and then automate as we go to attempt to reduce the operational burden.\n\nFurthermore, managing two different sets of infrastructure is not for the faint of heart, or those unfamiliar with Hybrid Cloud management. While the patterns may be very similar, the implementation proved to be a lot more work than we anticipated.\n\nFor example, AWS and other cloud service providers make APIs available to interact on a very granular level with their exposed components. On the other end of the spectrum, even the most mature on-prem infrastructure providers rely on their own custom tooling for managing hardware components. This is why projects such as Ansible are in such heavy use in the IT industry, and S6 is no exception here as we prioritize the use of open source tools where possible to ease cognitive load and keep costs low.\n\nThe challenge that made this most difficult was the disparity in experience using this approach on our team members’ time. Some of us come from more of a Platforming background, others from a Tooling background, and still others from primarily a Jenkins Pipeline writing background. This is great for general cross-functionality within the team, but requires careful planning to execute well even among the highest-performing teams.\n\nVersion Control\n\nWe use two different version control systems to manage the development lifecycle of our code: Perforce for the game code, and git (hosted in Bitbucket) for everything else.\n\nUsing different version control systems is clearly suboptimal and not a decision we took lightly: git is generally preferred by backend engineers and is far better supported by modern development environments.\n\nUnfortunately, Perforce is very well integrated in Unreal Engine because that’s what Epic Games uses (the makers of Unreal Engine). Also, git isn’t really designed to work with very large binary files, and a lot of our in-game assets and original sources are giant binary files. Perforce works well in these situations.\n\nEarly on, we tried using git-lfs (large file storage), which is supposed to help with this problem but we gave up when we realized how much effort it would be to retrofit all of the Epic development tools (UnrealGameSync, for example) to work with git.\n\nWe sincerely wish we had a single consolidated version control system and code review workflow, but it is not a trivial exercise.\n\nSpotlight: Consolidated Repos\n\nOne of the issues we faced with git was that it was too easy and convenient to create new repositories, causing a proliferation of them. The biggest issue we faced was the inability to make changes that cross-cut different services at once. This created a lot of production overhead and reduced our ability to consolidate the behavior of services.\n\nWe considered switching to a full “monorepo” but many of us were unfamiliar with it and feared additional complexity and overhead that we had no additional development capacity to support.\n\nThe compromise we reached was a handful of consolidated repos in which many individual git repositories were merged into a single repository and then archived. All the microservices ended up in this single repository, but they could be developed, built, tested and deployed in isolation. This made it much easier to modify code across services (such as version dependencies) as well as simplifying the creation of libraries. This approach facilitated an incremental externalization of common functionality into modules that could be more easily reused across services, reducing copy/paste code duplication and reducing our maintenance costs.\n\nSaaS-y Open Source\n\nOne common theme you might have noticed in our architecture is that we prefer to depend on software that is open source and that we could host ourselves if we wanted/needed to. We also prefer to rely on a SaaS vendor that provides and manages this software for us instead of running it ourselves.\n\nThis offers us several advantages:\n\nWe are not locked into a particular cloud or vendor provider (as we could run the system ourselves if we needed to).\n\nWe can provision systems more quickly (our people don’t need to learn the intricacies of configuring them).\n\nLeverage vendor expertise to fix issues and/or edge cases when we encounter them.\n\nKeeps the vendor prices under control under our threat of shutting down our vendor contract and hosting the system ourselves.\n\nWe deviated from this posture only rarely and when there was no open source alternative that made sense for our business needs. However, we do believe this paradigm worked well for us and provides a way to fund and support further development of these open source projects. This, in turn, lowers our future risks by helping make the development of these open projects more sustainable (as these hosting vendors often employ contributors to the open source projects and continue to fund their contributions for mutually symbiotic benefit).\n\nConclusions\n\nIt’s rare to get access to the source code that makes up video games, so it’s rare to have the opportunity to learn directly from it. Even rarer is a view into the decisions and tradeoffs, the lessons learned, the paths not taken and those taken but with later regret.\n\nWe hope that this deep-dive on the challenges and successes of creating Palia’s software architecture provides some insight and inspiration for others facing similar challenges.\n\nIf you have any questions about Palia’s software architecture and development, or simply if you want to start a conversation feel free to reach out to us at hello@singularity6.com.\n\nSpecial Thanks\n\nThe list of people that contributed to this architecture is very long (see the Palia credits for the full list) and we wouldn’t do it justice to replicate it here. Here, we thank the people that helped us contributing to our editorial (in chronological order of contribution): Kyle Allan, Anthony Leung, Adam Passey, Brian Tomlinson, Emily Price, Jordan Orelli, Michael Chance, Javi Carlos.",

      "# [Sixer Game Night 2024: A Night of Neon, Nostalgia, And Non](https://www.singularity6.com/news/sixer-game-night-2024)\nLast week, the Palian moons aligned for Sixers who participated in Sixer Game Night, an epic soirée where Singularity 6 stormed arcades in LA, Seattle, Chicago, and Las Vegas. The vibe was electric as the team gathered to celebrate our love for games, both digital and analog.\n\nThe festivities kicked off with a culinary homage to our childhood favorites. The menu was a mouthwatering spread of comfort food classics: pigs-in-a-blankey, chicken tendies, yummy sliders, mountains of crispy truffle fries, and fruit to stave off scurvy (Arrr!). And what's a Game Night without a few libations to toast our collective camaraderie of creativity?\n\nIt wouldn’t be a Sixer celebration without a lil’ Karaoke; that age-old tradition of belting out tunes with the confidence of Vanilla Ice (regardless of actual singing ability, of course). Several Sixers grabbed (and dropped!) the mic, belting out ballads known and niche. Several smart watches warned against heightened decibel levels. But “In The End,” “I Want It That Way.”\n\nOf course, Singularity 6 is a video game studio, and it’s the arcade where Sixers truly shined. The simulated dance battles were fierce, with team members stepping, hopping, and jumping in a mesmerizing dance of rhythm and coordination-ish. And the kart races were a sight to behold, with friendly rivalries emerging as racers chucked red, green, and blue (!!!) shells across the track for several photo-finish victories (to most folks’ chagrin). A surprise fishing game left us ‘reeling’ after reeling-in some outrageously-sized Tuna. And let's not forget the claw machine – a test of patience and precision as Sixers collected an army of ducks that now embellish several studio workspaces.\n\nBut beyond the games, the laughter, and the sheer joy of human connection; Sixer Game Night was a reflection of what makes Singularity 6 so special. It's the people – our team – who bring their passion, creativity, and enthusiasm to everything we do, whether it's crafting Palia’s next big feature, or quacking about their latest toy waterfowl.\n\nAs the night wound down and we said our goodbyes, it was clear that Game Night wasn't just about playing games. It was about building memories, strengthening bonds, and celebrating the incredible community that is Singularity 6. Here's to many more nights of neon, nostalgia, and nonstop fun.",

So they want the company to put more effort into the cash shop than the game. Welcome to the realities of the F2P model.\n\nThese same criticisms were made of Fortnite when it launched.  It's gone on to do just fine, and had continued to have a cash shop of cosmetics that don't affect gameplay.  As long as it's strictly cosmetic, I really don't see a problem.  100% of the game (incomplete as it might be) can be experienced with paying a dime.\n\n### Comment ID jwg9fhv with +12 score by [(Pling7, Reddit, 2023-08-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwg9fhv/) (in reply to ID jwg4lqm):\nFortnite was basically fully actualized as a product though. The problem with Palia lies with priorities. Many systems are unrealized and unpolished compared to other games like it (from much smaller studios) yet the cash shop is already up an functioning. It also begs the question, what are their motivations for doing things the way they do them? Is making the game online in itself done just to sell more cosmetics? Are they going to forgo a more interactive pet system in lieu of one where they can sell cosmetic only pets?  \n\n \\- In a game with such few systems cosmetics play a much larger role in motivating a player. The fact that it's open beta only makes the emphasis on MTX items that much more glaring of a problem (because there's basically nothing to work for at some point).\n\n#### Comment ID jwgi277 with +7 score by [(hyrle, Reddit, 2023-08-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwgi277/) (in reply to ID jwg9fhv):\nWhen Fortnite was in beta, it wasn't a finalized product, though.  It had far fewer features than it has now.  It didn't have several of the systems it has now.  It had far fewer game modes.  In fact, it spent years in beta.\n\nI get the concerns over lack of content in Palia.  I even get concerns about cosmetics costing more than people want to pay (let's face it... any price over $0 is going to be more than some people want to pay.)  But it must be remembered this is a recently-opened live service game that's in beta and shouldn't be critiqued as if it's a complete game.  Even the fully-launched Fortnite continues to evolve, and I'm certain Palia will as long as it is profitable enough to keep it going.    And if it's not profitable, then like hundreds of live service games before it, then it'll close shop as so many F2P games have done before.\n\nIt's understandable that some might not like the direction of that evolution - and it's fair to critique that - but I'm just saying the expectations for a beta should be far lower.\n\n### Comment ID jwgxycg with +2 score by [(MeVe90, Reddit, 2023-08-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwgxycg/) (in reply to ID jwg4lqm):\nI'm surprised they didn't launch a battle pass yet\n\n## Comment ID jwik56a with +5 score by [(Eggsysmistress, Reddit, 2023-08-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwik56a/) (in reply to ID 15ss9gg):\ni thought they were an indie studio at first and was like “aww what a cute game. i’m sure they’ll work hard to make it better”. \n\npfft.\n\n## Comment ID jwjkx17 with +4 score by [(magvadis, Reddit, 2023-08-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwjkx17/) (in reply to ID 15ss9gg):\nIndie has to due with being owned by a major game company. \n\nOne 50 million dollar game does not make you major...at all.\n\n### Comment ID jwjlwc7 with +2 score by [(PsyTripper, Reddit, 2023-08-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwjlwc7/) (in reply to ID jwjkx17):\nThanks for clearing that up.

It basically means pay to not be hindered at every step, otherwise you fall behind everyone else. Monetizing bag slots, adding inventory weight and monetizing that, nerfing xp gains and implementing boosts, storage space, stricter decoration limits etc, etc, etc, you get the picture. Something similar to Black Desert Online would be the route they take. While BDO isn't exactly P2W in the old sense, you definitely have to pay to not get completely and utterly shafted in everything you do.\n\n### Comment ID lbc2pfl with +1 score by [(nemamene, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lbc2pfl/) (in reply to ID lb823yk):\nan example would be tools that are even better than exquisite. mine big pal in 2 hits, etc.\n\n#### Comment ID lbjnovc with +1 score by [(god_plz_no, Reddit, 2024-07-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lbjnovc/) (in reply to ID lbc2pfl):\nSell boosts in bulk, like fisherman tonics, dowsing rods, compasses etc. for faster farming or even blatant XP boosters like Ubisoft)\n\n## Comment ID lb7q8ec with +132 score by [(FawkTheElf, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb7q8ec/) (in reply to ID 1dt7ujt):\nOh the company that killed h1z1, cooooooooooooool. \n\nHere is hoping things go well.\n\n### Comment ID lb84smp with +44 score by [(ScurvyDanny, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb84smp/) (in reply to ID lb7q8ec):\nLotRO is going strong still, and they have a system where you can earn premium content for free, so I'm not that worried.\n\n#### Comment ID lb8wla8 with +27 score by [(Iroh_the_Dragon, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb8wla8/) (in reply to ID lb84smp):\nI believe that feature has been around since looooong before the game was acquired by Daybreak. Taking away that feature would’ve lost them a ton of players as deeds(the activity that earns the store currency) are a very popular thing for many veteran players to work on once they’ve completed the current end game raids and dungeons. Essentially, the MMO saying “the true end game is fashion” is very much based in reality for LOTRO. The feature has basically been grandfathered in throughout the various acquisitions LOTRO has gone through over the years. (source: I’ve been playing LOTRO off and on for over a decade)\n\nPalia, however, is still very new and, as a result, very malleable. I’m trying to remain optimistic, but I won’t be surprised if this acquisition means big changes for Palia and its monetization. Ultimately, though, if it means the game will make it to 1.0 while retaining its heart and soul, I’ll be ecstatic. The S6 devs have created a really solid foundation and I’d love to see what else they have planned.\n\n#### Comment ID lb87gk4 with +14 score by [(AmberRosalie_, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb87gk4/) (in reply to ID lb84smp):\nThey only publish LoTRO though so I’m not sure how much actual involvement they have.

So I had not to spend anything there.\n\nAnd the fee to purchase the Add-ons was really low compared to the original price in points.\n\nIf i remember it correctly, they had giveaway free, 26 Quest packs from different zones, and offer each expansion pack from Moria to Mordor for each 100 points only, while the mordor pack had cost 2500 points.\n\nSure, without that event it had taken more time to get it free, but could still be possible.

I have seen some games under the Daybreak banner flourish and others fail.\n\nIn the official statement released it does say that S6 and the game development will still stay under the current leadership.  This  lends hope that maybe Palia will have some luck similar to LotRO where Daybreak is more of a \"publisher\" than a developer.  \n\nWill we see more monetization?  Of course.  A game has to have a revenue stream somehow to continue support and development.  This would have been coming regardless of the Daybreak acquisition or not.  And if they didn't, then our favorite world would eventually die out.\n\nAll we can do at this point is just wait and see.  Me personally, I'll continue to play just how I've been playing and watch what changes.  If it starts to change for the better, GREAT!  If it starts to go downhill, then I'll just start looking for a new home.\n\n## Comment ID lb9zaxp with +9 score by [(mistar_z, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb9zaxp/) (in reply to ID 1dt7ujt):\nI'm concerned for the employees. I knew that when they did all those big layoffs earlier this year it meant that they're probably planning for a sale or acquisition, to look better on paper . This sadly isn't great news for the remaining employees as acquisitions normally means more layoffs on the horizon as the leadership restructures the company to their new bottom line.\n\n\nBut on the positive side.

There’s always more layoffs on the horizon. They change the company culture.

I wouldn’t be surprised if they stayed pushing ads for in game purchases and went in a different direction with art eventually. \n\nWe can’t forget that S6 is a for-profit company.

If they were making plenty off of people buying the clothing and just wanting to support the company, there wouldn’t have been layoffs. It sucks, but there’s a reason MMOs don’t follow this monetization model, and it’s not JUST corporate greed.

Daybreak, formerly known as Sony Online Entertainment, launched EverQuest in 1999 and the game is still going. BUT, it has a ton of paid expansion as well as a monthly subscription you NEED to buy in order to be able to play the game, sort of like World of Warcraft.\n\nI kinda see them going for the same model for Palia but i desperately hope they won't. I'd love to have more things i CAN buy but not things i NEED to buy in order for the game to be fun.\n\nIn terms of game longevity i think this is a good move, there are many old games from Daybreak that are still going (kinda) strong for many years.\n\nEDIT: Everquest has recently became free to play, after 25 years lmao\n\n### Comment ID lb8wv8b with +4 score by [(namakost, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb8wv8b/) (in reply to ID lb8sw64):\nI would understand if they took it blindly with whatever daybreak attached to it, but the devs are so passionate that I can't imagine that they wouldn't put some ground rules for monetization since a big part of palias marketing revolves around free content and accessibility for everyone.\n\n### Comment ID lb9dmm6 with +3 score by [(enbyshaymin, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb9dmm6/) (in reply to ID lb8sw64):\n*Formerly known as Sony Online Entertainment and Verant Interactive, co-developers of EverQuest since 1999.\n\nDaybreak's history is weird af. First, they were part of SISA with which they started developement of EverQuest. Then SOE was made and SISA was renamed into 989 Studios. THEN they went into making PS games, while a branch spun off and formed RedEye Interactive which was then renamed as Verant Interactive.\n\nThen they released EverQuest. Later they were controlled by Sony Pictures which iirc was like, it's grandparent company (Sony Pictures owned SOE which owned Verant), and later in 2015 SOE was sold off to Columbus Nova and Verant changed it's name into Daybreak.\n\nWhich they claim no, they didn't, they were bought by Inception Acquisitions... which was related to Columbus Nova. Which was involved with the Renova Group. Which was... in trouble, to say the least, during 2016. Oh, those russians!\n\nThen in 2018 a mobile game company \"strategically\" invested in Daybreak to port games to mobile... and three rounds of layoffs occurred. Things went awry, it got separated into three teams and then in 2020 they were bought by Enad Global 7. \n\nThey also took over MTG Online in 2022, and it seems they had few layoffs since, with a recent one being of \"less than 15 employees\" from their three branches.\n\nAll that said, S6 may be lucky and have no issues now that Daybreak's situation has changed.\n\n### Comment ID lb9kexf with +4 score by [(h39000, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb9kexf/) (in reply to ID lb8sw64):\nI never had issues w the WoW sub because the game *worked*.

My old long time gamer husband tells me this isnt a bad thing at all. I trust his judgement on this because all I am seeing is folks getting their underwear twisted over how the company choose to fund the work on the game. Frankly we are lucky to have had a free game which hasnt had anything but skins behind a paywall. So how about a bit of positivity and hope instead? S6 have as far as I can tell in the 4 months of playing, given players practically everything they could do within the game mechanics as it stands.  Wanted plushies? you got them.. wanted trees? got them, wanted flow trees on your plot? you got them! Wanted hotpot back? we got it! Bigger houses? got that too....! S6 have listened and delivered where they can. So enough whining and moaning about their partnership with an established game provider, they can rehire, and hopefully we will see the fruits of this soon! If you dont want to buy into stuff then dont but if you are going to moan about a FREE to play game that is still currently in dev mode then you really need to find something else to do with your life.   \nPersonally I think this is rather exciting for S6, it shows confidence from the industry that Palia is viable for the future.\n\n### Comment ID lbbgeoy with +5 score by [(marchviolet, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lbbgeoy/) (in reply to ID lbasarc):\nMy own longtime gamer husband also had a relatively positive reaction to this news when I shared it with him.

Is it going to end up in maintenance mode soon,or will the money earned from the sale be put into development? Will Devs from other projects come help with Palia, or the other way round? Will it be micromanaged by a boss, will it get new management, will they continue as was?

They are pretty much the exact opposite of what S6 was about when it comes to monetization. The fact S6 was even open to an acquisition in the first place isn't a good sign but if you couple that with them actually going through with it with such a publisher speaks volumes. This one line from the official acquisition statement says it all.\n\n\"It is incredibly exciting to find like-minded partners who share in our commitment to investing in our products and players for the long-term\"\n\nLet's focus on this a little, \"products\" and \"players\". First off, S6 would never refer to the game as a \"product\", so right from the start you know this section wasn't written by them. Secondly, any time a company mentions 2 things under the same context you should always read them separately like this.\n\n\"It is incredibly exciting to find like-minded partners who share in our commitment to investing in our products\"\n\n\"It is incredibly exciting to find like-minded partners who share in our commitment to investing in our players for the long-term\"\n\nRead that last one about players and what does it sound like to you? I'll spell it out for you just in case...we are the product, not the game. They have invested in a new player base that is outside there normal target audience. Whether this is good or bad will remain to be seen but they have an expectation of a return on that investment and with a game like Palia that could be tricky. It costs more to create something new then it does to place artificial limitations on us and people are far more likely to spend money on a better experience then on a prettier one. So like I originally said, hope for the best but prepare for the worst because the odds are not in our favor here by a long shot and it really pains me because I love this game.\n\nEDIT: Somehow the other half of my comment got cut when I posted lol. So here is my optimistic side.\n\nThis DOES have a bright side to it. Investment from a bigger company can be a really good thing. Most of the games under Daydreams publishing are actually good games if you ignore the monetization factor. The world building and lore behind most of them are top notch, but the story writing tends to be a little lack luster. S6 however has great writing and a LOT of lore and world elements to build upon so with Daydreams backing Palia has a lot going for it in a good way.\n\n## Comment ID lb83d6r with +9 score by [(haffasandwitch, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb83d6r/) (in reply to ID 1dt7ujt):\n![gif](giphy|7doqMMIYTH1Zkq9mpY|downsized)\n\n## Comment ID lbbmyo0 with +4 score by [(TwistedReads, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lbbmyo0/) (in reply to ID 1dt7ujt):\nwell. good run everyone see you in the next game!\n\n## Comment ID lbdyjsa with +6 score by [(evaperated, Reddit, 2024-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lbdyjsa/) (in reply to ID 1dt7ujt):\nHonestly I’m a huge fan of the battle pass model, and would welcome something like that in Palia.

They either complain that a one time fee for a game is ‘ridiculously overpriced’ or they complain a completely free to play game DARES to have a cash shop feature.\n\nI’ve bought outfits I like in Palia, and bought the landscapes and a couple pets.

For a life Sim it lacks basic features, the decorating is nice but you can hardly interact with anything. Especially in town. Benches you can't sit in at all, a tavern where you can't sit eat, drink, nothing. \n\nAnd for an mmo it's like 20 people in a town map, and your alone in your home instance. They could have done a neighborhood like xiv so you can at least see some other houses without having to ask to be invited. \n\nThere is a clothing shop but it only sells clothes for premium currency, all \"basic\" clothes are just unlocked from the start. The shop is basically purely cosmetic as well since you just buy it from the store, from anywhere. \n\nThe character creator is pretty barebones as well, for a fully social game with no other real content besides rp. Like two body types, 4 faces, and maybe 20 hairstyles. This should have had City of Heroes level of customization or more.\n\n### Comment ID ky83aom with +23 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-04-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1bwiuin/cozy_mmo_palia_developer_singularity_6_has/ky83aom/) (in reply to ID ky6tkrn):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID ky9fot3 with +17 score by [(LaurenMille, Reddit, 2024-04-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1bwiuin/cozy_mmo_palia_developer_singularity_6_has/ky9fot3/) (in reply to ID ky83aom):\nAre they still instantly banning anyone that offers constructive criticism? \n\nI was part of the exodus of players that happened when they went on their banning spree with anyone that wouldn't parrot exactly what they said.\n\n#### Comment ID kyauig7 with +10 score by [(SyleSpawn, Reddit, 2024-04-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1bwiuin/cozy_mmo_palia_developer_singularity_6_has/kyauig7/) (in reply to ID ky83aom):\nI've *played* the game since Alpha (I think 3 years ago), the core problem is that what was available in Alpha was *exactly* what was delivered in Beta 2 years later.

It was basicaly Sci-Fi Warcraft, but it didn’t feel as “WoW clone” at all. The World Building was on point and it was all funny and jokes most of the time, but very serious when an important story archs happened. Just a perfect way how to tell a story imho.\n\nGameplay-wise it had everything what you wanted from an OG theme park mmorpg, but in a modern coat. Dungeons, raids, pvp bgs and arenas, ranked modes, awesome housing system, the list goes on. The best part? It released with all of that stuff. No “alpha” bullshit. Except for bugs and tuning, it just felt finished on the release day.\n\nMany people will disagree with me, but it was THE mmorpg for me. I played from start to shut-down and I wish I re-lived it again. My only real problems with the game was the simplified gearing system ( just 1 weapon per class ) and the telegraph spell system just wasn’t right in large scale battles ( most of the ground were just green and red circles and you couldn’t see anything in battlegrounds for example.)\n\n#### Comment ID lbb3stf with +28 score by [(Deadpoetic6, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbb3stf/) (in reply to ID lbb1yz9):\nTheme,  world, music, combat, housing, artstyle\n\n#### Comment ID lbck51e with +5 score by [(aplcdr, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbck51e/) (in reply to ID lbb1yz9):\nClasses were a lot of fun, I liked race design and the housing system is probably the best that there has ever been\n\n#### Comment ID lbbmdjc with +22 score by [(Akhevan, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbbmdjc/) (in reply to ID lbb1yz9):\n> What features did it have or what was so universally enjoyed about it?\n\nThe fact that it closed down.  \n\nIt was plagued by shitty design decisions and everybody largely hated it while it was still running.\n\n#### Comment ID lbbicbf with +29 score by [(BeatDownn, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbbicbf/) (in reply to ID lbb1yz9):\nPeople just want what they can't have.

Especially something like EQ, which doesn't necessarily have the highest player count, but something like 80% of all players subscribe, which is an incredible conversion rate for any game.\n\nThey also have stuff like DCUO, LOTRO (at a time when there's a lot of LotR media coming out) and DDO (at a time when D&D is really popular).\n\nPlus, like MassivelyOP pointed out once, all Daybreak games have essentially paid off their initial development costs and are running with super small teams. A dev for LOTRO has said that he's doing stuff solo that used to require six devs in the Turbine days, thanks to more efficient tools and content pipelines.\n\nSo I think Daybreak in particular has just really turned all their companies into lean operations with solid profit margins.\n\n#### Comment ID lbf6cju with +1 score by [(Vanrax, Reddit, 2024-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbf6cju/) (in reply to ID lbem1yc):\nPretty much.

      "# Post ID 1bqq6c8: Palia Dev Update: “we’ll keep our players updated with as much information as possible as we approach what we consider to be our official launch.” with +310 score by [(kyleblane, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/)\n[https://palia.com/news/dev-update-7](https://palia.com/news/dev-update-7)\n\nFull Text (of beta section)\n\n>**Palia is Currently in Open Beta**  \n>  \n>We want to clear the air: since our Open Beta launch back in August 2023, the **game remains as a title still in Open Beta**. Know that we’ll keep our players updated with as much information as possible as we approach what we consider to be our official launch.  \n>  \n>We're aware that there has been feedback regarding our messaging and status on various platforms, but the emphasis is that Palia is free-to-play and available for anyone to try. It is a continuous, ongoing effort, and we are committed to providing patch updates with new content, improvements, and bug fixes well into the future.  \n>  \n>In fact, looking at our version, being on 0.178 means we’ve made over 178 updates to the game! Even from the start, and the days of Pre-Alpha, we made sure to include player feedback and have it shape Palia to be where it is today. And when it’s ready, we also plan to have the versioning update from “0.XXX” to “1.XXX” to better reflect Palia’s new status — but even that is not the end. We’ll keep having more patches after, and developing Palia alongside our players. That was one of the primary reasons why we wanted it to be a free-to-play, live-service game.  \n>  \n>We invite everyone to be part of this journey.\n\nFirst of all, when you need to \"clear the air\" that your game is still in beta you've failed at the most basic communication about your game.\n\nThe bare minimum required to provide \"as much information as possible\" as your game approaches launch is to properly inform players that the game hasn't yet been launched. Steam and Epic versions should be in Early Access. Switch should have some form of \"beta\" mentioned somewhere. The word \"beta\" should exist somewhere on the website other than news updates and the EULA. It's a very easy decision to make, and a very easy change to implement.\n\nThis dev update is void of any definitive action they're going to take. They only say that they are aware of the feedback and are focusing on communicating that the game is free (As if the two messages can't coexist LOL). I hope I'm wrong and this is just a poorly worded update, but I don't expect to see any communication changes regarding the beta status of the game.\n\n## Comment ID kx6h2br with +71 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx6h2br/) (in reply to ID 1bqq6c8):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID kx7hkxm with +16 score by [(OreoYip, Reddit, 2024-03-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx7hkxm/) (in reply to ID kx6h2br):\nI am okay with the conversations but honestly, it is getting a bit old hat.

UI text size sliders - for people who are playing on Steam Deck for example! Brightness sliders - maybe you just prefer your games to not be that bright! And then other accessibility options  include making the temples doable without having to do complicated maneuvers and having to react at exactly the right time etc etc - some disabled players won't be able to fulfill the challenges at all as they are now, but even players who can fulfill the challenges might not want to do this kind of challenge. I personally get super annoyed with all of the temples, as the rest of the game (except for hunting and some bug catching stuff) is way lower stakes and I fucking hate when I have to jump precisely in games. So I'd profit from an option to do this challenge in an easier way, too (and my keyboard and desk would love that too cause I get really angry and frustrated 😅)\n\n### Comment ID kx4dyj4 with +24 score by [(TheSilentTragedy, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx4dyj4/) (in reply to ID kx4914c):\nAlso this. Many of my friends (many of which were active members of the accessibility channel there) were banned the other day for asking questions, one was banned simply because they wanted to know why their mute had persisted longer than it was supposed to (they were muted for an extra hour instead of the original mute time). \n\nTheir mods/devs have admitted that they have a hard time remaining unbiased regarding critic of the game - in my most respectful and honest opinion, the biggest problem they have (in regard to their Discord) is a lack of a well-acting, level-headed moderation team.\n\n#### Comment ID kx4efjj with +26 score by [(kyleblane, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx4efjj/) (in reply to ID kx4dyj4):\nEarlier on Discord I was asking about details regarding this dev update.

And they said in this weird dev log, that when they go out of beta, their version number will start with a 1 instead of a 0 (current version number is 0.178)\n\n## Comment ID kx4cwmu with +50 score by [(TheSilentTragedy, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx4cwmu/) (in reply to ID 1bqq6c8):\nThere have been major issues with the response to feedback (mods being overzealous with banning people with critic of the game while others freely harass them in general chats) in their official Discord, so this response wasn't surprising at all.\n\nThe funny thing is they were told this was an issue during their Switch release and they blamed it on Nintendo for why they couldn't add the word beta, so they KNEW that marking the game as being in beta on the storefront was something they needed to do and they just didn't care.\n\n### Comment ID kx4f32b with +17 score by [(kyleblane, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx4f32b/) (in reply to ID kx4cwmu):\nDo you have a source for them blaming Nintendo?

I base it on the reviews. But I'm reading this post from the devs and think they are back peddling due to backlash. Honestly, imo it's easier to justify bugs for games in early access. It would be to their advantage to put it under the early access banner. Why they didn't, I don't really understand. People would give them a pass for bugs. \n\nMaybe they should mention at least in the text of the steam store for the game that it's in beta. Not hidden in the announcement. Normal people don't even read that.\n\n## Comment ID kx48goa with +31 score by [(Etheria_system, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx48goa/) (in reply to ID 1bqq6c8):\nThis comes across so defensively - they had the chance to say “we didn’t get this right and here’s what we’re going to change in our messaging” but instead they’re doubling down.

Please forgive any crappy formatting on mobile.\n\nDecember 2023 Switch update:\nNo mention of Beta anywhere on the Nintendo eshop page. For weeks leading up to the release multiple members in the discord tagged CMs asking for clarification. CMs would conveniently disappear from conversation or straight up ignore the question while responding to other members. Game launches and what’s missing from the splash page on the switch? The beta tag. The excuse then became “oh well Nintendo doesn’t do beta/early access so take it up with them”. Sandrock was quite literally hosting an early access at this time. \n\nFebruary 2024:\nThey announce the steam release. Members point out that the MMO tag has been scrubbed and there’s no mention of the game being in beta. Every week members would be tagging the CMs to ask and get clarification, warning the CMs that this would lead to negative reviews. The CM response was gifs and saying they’d pass it along to the rest of the team. Members also noted that the Palia website had also been scrubbed of the beta label at this time.\n\nBefore this they were telling people they banned for questioning the lack of beta tag that they had no control over what steam labeled the game as and now it’s too late because once a game has been published you can no longer mark it as early access and beta. \n\nI know this doesn’t matter to some people and I think that’s perfectly fine BUT for some of us a company being intentionally deceitful repeatedly is a big red flag. Many of us have played for hundreds of hours, sunk money into the game and built a community with people inside and outside of the game so we’re feeling quite passionate and honestly concerned about the way things are going. \n\nI’d also like to add this is a team that brags about being industry vets, these are people that know what they’re doing and are now trying to handwave all this away with “oh we’re still learning”. This isn’t a small indie team and hell even small indie teams know to mark a game in beta/EA. Honestly this dev update is only in response to the negative feedback there’s not even any mention of accountability, this wording it reads to me like “well it’s free so who cares”. I care! They have a cash shop and yes it’s optional BUT there is still a way for people to spend money on game by a company that is intentionally trying to mislead its player base and I’m sorry but I’m not okay with that.\n\n### Comment ID kx4ktvz with +23 score by [(kyleblane, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx4ktvz/) (in reply to ID kx4k5ml):\nBravo for good formatting on mobile.

I don’t want to yuck other peoples yum lol! I haven’t left a review and try not to speak negatively of the game even in the discord now because I can see it’s bringing a lot of people joy BUT I also feel like it’s causing people to have major blinders on. Singularity 6 talked about wanting to be different and player focused so I wanted to hold them to the standard they set for themselves and see them make a really good game.

I haven’t gotten deep enough to see some of the overt flaws yet (aside from thinking the shop is extremely overpriced) but I wouldn’t have known this was in beta if not for this post. Thanks OP for sharing and I completely agree with your take! \n\nThe update from the Palia team comes off defensive and doesn’t have any accountability in the failure to communicate the status of their game. It being free doesn’t negate it from criticism or basic expectations of knowing it isn’t fully launched. \n\nThis honestly makes me want to uninstall. There are so many other games out there in this genre that handle criticism better, deserve a bigger spotlight, and communicate with the community in a more transparent, productive way.\n\n## Comment ID kx55wzz with +18 score by [(zeoxious, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx55wzz/) (in reply to ID 1bqq6c8):\nFor the record the people who they banned for discussing this are still banned and the community manager said she was too scared to talk to us..\n\n### Comment ID kx57474 with +17 score by [(kyleblane, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx57474/) (in reply to ID kx55wzz):\nTheir community management started out rough and has somehow gotten worse.\n\n## Comment ID kx72xri with +3 score by [(Strawberry_Sheep, Reddit, 2024-03-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx72xri/) (in reply to ID 1bqq6c8):\nThey wouldn't have even needed to clarify they were in Open Beta if they hadn't removed all the wording about it from their website, the launcher, the discord, the store page, etc...\n\n### Comment ID kx7b6n5 with +4 score by [(kyleblane, Reddit, 2024-03-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx7b6n5/) (in reply to ID kx72xri):\nThis is what the fans are missing.

I've been saying they've been shady since their post about sitting in chairs coming off as more of a \"there. Aren't you guys glad we did this for you? You should be happy we did (the bare minimum) hard work with sit-tech and now you can sit in chairs so stop pestering us.\" Post. (Not the exact quote but it did feel very passive aggressive)\n\nI remember saying that despite this game being free with optional microtransactions, this was going to be one of those barely updated, barely fixed games with barely anything in it worth playing but the store would be absolutely cluttered with new stuff. What happened when I stated that? \n\nDeath threats(yes. I kid you not lmfao) the typical \"It's free. Stop complaining.\", then there were the \"They're taking their time to get it right. If you don't like it don't play it.\" (I stopped around the time they dropped the news that outfits will always be microtransactions) and then people telling me that I was too poor to play the game and I was just a poor hater. Lmao. \n\nWell, despite all those people jumping my butt, I am glad but also disappointed to see that I was mostly right. It's a shame because I hoped they'd take player feedback seriously and make this a game worth sticking around for...but once again, game companies be game company-ing. Glad I didn't hang on to that hope and get let down like I am sure many others have. \n\nI am sorry to those who looked forward to this game being something amazing. Hopefully the game grind loop is enough to keep you playing long enough until a better game comes out for you. Hopefully before they decide that \"It is with a heavy heart that we shut down servers to Palia.\" When theyve finally made enough off their little money maker disguised as a free game.\n\n### Comment ID kx4rbml with +16 score by [(PlantPotStew, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx4rbml/) (in reply to ID kx4mb9l):\nThis reminds me a lot of Disney Dreamlight. Although, I quit that, so who knows if it got any better or if it is going down the direction I thought it would.\n\nI mean, I hope it got better, so those people who shrugged their shoulders saying \"It's free! I got hundreds of hours\" Can have their fun. Ideally every game would have a redemption arc like No Mans Sky and Cyberpunk.\n\nIt's exhausting to see casual gamers defend this type of stuff again and again. Sure, they can make their own decisions*, but I thought ignorance was the issue. But it's not, they literally don't care and don't want to care, and... I see this in politics and so many other more important areas that it's just annoying. Companies/whatever are going to keep getting worse because people will keep buying/voting the same way because they just don't care. Worse, they'll shut you down so they can keep living in ignorance.\n\nI get that this seems a bit dramatic, it's just a game, but... eh. It's a pattern. Dystopian Sci-Fi writers don't see the future, they recognize a pattern.\n\n\n*Saying this, because if I didn't, they'd say that it's their right to think so.

Setting proper expectations. It's poor management on their part to NOT make it clear. It speaks poorly to their management more than anything else.\n\nPlayers are absolutely purchasing premium cash shop items under false pretenses though. On Switch specifically.

You're worried about functional changes to the game and I'm worried about a developer intentionally misleading customers.\n\nI have yet to hear a good reason to not mention beta in all of the storefronts, and use Steam and Epic's Early Access label.

Its a free game, I downloaded the day it released on Switch, the 0.XXX always made sense as beta for me, and I've already sunk 160 hours into Palia, more than any other game on my Switch, including ones that were $60. \n\nIs it perfect? No. Is it done? No. There are bugs and glitches but for me that was expected and as someone who is not active on the discord or subreddits it feels like people are overly pissed off about the game and being kinda dickheads to the devs. \n\nIf you don't like it or don't like the devs or don't like their communication, then don't play it! No one is holding a gun to your head forcing you to play or talk about it lmfao. I just personally don't understand sinking a bunch of time into talking about something you don't like. If the game had a cost and people had paid for it and been upset about it being in beta I would get that but like worst case scenario you downloaded a free thing and it were dissapointed because it wasn't what you expected. Okay, bummer, but like, not a huge deal?

You seem more dismissive, then interested, in learning why this could be important. I'm not the best at this topic, but-\n\n> If you don't like it or don't like the devs or don't like their communication, then don't play it! No one is holding a gun to your head forcing you to play or talk about it lmfao\n\nIs a terrible stance to take about this type of stuff. I know you'll probably say \"It's just a game\" but it's important to talk about how companies conduct themselves. \n\nMicrotransactions and other unsavoury tactics like that flourish when people dismiss them as \"Just cosmetics, game is still free.\" Despite games like this specifically attempting to make you spend your money on cosmetics (20$ for a digital outfit). When other companies notice there's a way to squeeze more money out of you, they'll start engaging in worse tactics, making levels specifically harder so you cave and buy more lives just to play the games. Or specifically making the feedback loop more addictive, or making it easier for children who aren't as aware of these tactics to buy things. \n\nYou could say \"It's the parent's job to prevent that\" But we have laws specifically to make dangerous/addictive things regulated, because we understand that the average person might not be educated enough to avoid them.\n\nI don't know if palia specifically falls into this category. But being open about EA is also important. When Disney Dreamlight came out, people bought the full game for 60$, because they specifically hid the fact that it is EA and the full game will release for free later. You're specifically buying to play earlier. It seems small, but the more stuff like that gets hidden as \"Not a big deal\" The more companies will continue to shift around things that they KNOW people want to know, and hide it because if a person did know, they wouldn't have bought/played it. You have a right to know what you are investing (Time, money, etc.) in.\n\nLying by omission, if not called out, is encouraged. You can get games who have been funded by millions only for all the news to be wiffle waffled on. And this keeps happening, because we don't talk about Early Access and the cons with it enough. Because casual gamers don't normally keep up with the news enough to see a pattern and think it's just a fluke that dumb people fell for. That they're smart and will never fall for similar predatory tactics.\n\nWhile people are supposed to make informed discissions, we also have to acknowledge that in the age of overinformation, it's not possible. If the only way to know if something is EA is by going on Twitter, or any other completely unrelated social network, you messed up! Transparency is the most important thing that can be done. If you can only tell it's a beta by seeing 0.2.4.5 version, it's not transparent, it means that people have to be tech savvy enough to understand what section of a version code means it's beta or finished.\n\nI also found from that experience a lot of casual gamers, who admit that this was their only game, didn't really understand a lot of game mechanics. Why having to spend 6+ hours mining rocks to make a basic decoration wasn't an acceptable grind, because they enjoyed doing mindless activities for 6 hours! Don't like it? Don't play it! We didn't, but before we left we decided it was worth explaining why, from our experience of MMO's gone bad, it's a sign on the wall.\n\nWhy having constant bugs and patches introduce more bugs, from experience in EA gone bad, were signs on the walls. \"All games have bugs, jeez\"\n\nWhy having the first microtransaction, from experience in mobile games, were signs on the wall. \"It's just clothing, don't like it? Don't buy it!\" despite a single chair being 20$ \"You don't need it\" Despite more things getting locked further and further, keeping an intentional cycle on FOMO.\n\nThey mostly subscribed to the same philosophy of \"It's free, and I got a lot of content out of it, so who cares about [microtransactions], [terrible dev communication], [terrible grinding mechanics]\" Which is fine, but they also refused to allow others to put in their two pence. Saying \"You're being toxic\" or \"Bringing down the mood\" or \"Why does everyone always have to complain, don't like it, don't play it!\" As if we can't have a discussion on anything but positive things. \n\nI think they see a lot of people, and forget that those individuals don't see others complaints are a part of their own, so instead of one person sharing one problem, it's hundreds sharing that one problem. Making it seem much more dramatic then it is for those people individually. I will admit some people take things too far, especially if the dev starts shutting down any mild conversations, extreme ones start surfacing.\n\nIf you've played video games for decades, you start seeing the same patterns that ruined other companies and games. You start recognizing the trend that gaming is going down.\n\nWe don't play it, but we also learned that boycotting doesn't work and companies will still cut as many corners while getting as much money as possible. We still feel like we should talk about it, at the very least, even if most people just shrug their shoulders and say \"Who cares? I still had fun.\"\n\nSorry, turned long and probably isn't as coherent as I'd like it to be.\n\n#### Comment ID kx5swdt with +6 score by [(ControlledEuphoria, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx5swdt/) (in reply to ID kx4o2h6):\nJust had to say I thought this was incredibly well thought out and perfectly coherent! I agree so much about transparency especially when it comes to beta/EA. I’m considering supporting Farmfolks even though they had a disaster of a first kickstarter based solely on the fact that the new team has been putting out consistent clear messaging. It’s so important we all do our part to try to keep companies accountable so that the beta/ea tag doesn’t immediately tank a game. Especially in the farming/cozy game community because a lot of these games get picked up by people that can’t or don’t have the time to spend navigating discords/reddits/steam forums to learn that the game they just downloaded is incomplete/has issues. Straightforward clear and consistent communication that is easily accessible to a consumer base is key.\n\n### Comment ID kx4gw5o with +12 score by [(Disig, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx4gw5o/) (in reply to ID kx4ecuc):\nYou've completely missed the point of the post.

Sitting here engaging in dozens and dozens of posts talking negatively about a game is so incredibly pointless and puts so much negativity into the space for what? Nothing.

They don't know they're buying cosmetics for an unfinished game.\n\nSecond, it speaks poorly of their management. Communicating that the game is in beta would only do good things for them and players have been saying this for a very long time. They've banned members of the Discord for questioning it, even going as far as telling them they're spreading false information. There is no good reason NOT to communicate the game is in beta, only selfish, deceitful reasons.\n\nBonus reason: It's good to be clear and honest.

Whatever that means to you, to me it means playing as and with a group.\nPalia has virtually zero of that. We can argue there's some in hunting and cooking. But barely. Feels more like something that happened by accident rather than design. The new tree dweller for instance is a lot of fun as a group.\n\nStill on the social aspect... No actual common goals.\nNo specialization and no trading. A spouse that farms whatever all day has no proper way to help their significant other than to actually go farm with them again. Random gift limits \nSocial Friend requests that cant be cancelled and forever perpetuate your list.\nOne of the 3 souls that still plays with me can't connect since the previous patch.\n\nTickets that have zero personalization. Straight out of a script and a request to send logs. Even on trivial things.\n\nPatches. There are many game devs here. We know how it is. HOWEVER... You can't always excuse it. If you already have the framework and are reskining things, the whole setup shouldn't break. Adding quest dialogue when you already have a quest system shouldn't be a server breaking ordeal.\nIf you are struggling with seasonal content like every other game does... You need a better testing group.\nThere has yet to be a single patch that didn't devolve into overtime. Not one. Even quick hotfixes have done it sometimes.\nAlso, if you add a \"let me do this quest later\" option... How about testing to make sure it works? A game breaking issue from the new NPC I saw no mention of since it was identified.\nYet, the new cosmetics keep coming at increased prices.\nI have no issue on this topic, but on the subject of optics, you have game breaking bugs but you project an appearance of cosmetics having priority, which will inevitably turn some players away.\n\nAnd finally, on the subject of PC player retention...\nWhile we understand you're aiming for a Switch release and probably have technical limitations to consider...\nDecades now of observing mmo players should be a STRONG indication that be it the competitive, builder or gatherer player type, \"more\" is the goal.\nHaving limitations has given you an (hopefully) unintended \"game over\".\nGold limitations, renown limitations, storage limitations, building limitations, heck, even farming limitations, are only going to turn the non casual player away. If you want players online most of their free time, this is not a good approach.\n\nIn sum, I have capped my gold, crafted all the furniture, maxed storage, farming, all rep is maxed...\nIt is now a game I sometimes load once a week to do weekly medals and forget about it the rest of the week. And even this amounts to 5 minutes of \"hey, want to catch 10 bugs with me?\". \n\nAnd then we load a game that let's us play together for a common goal.\n\nTldr, please make your social game... Social.\n\n### Comment ID kca3916 with +8 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kca3916/) (in reply to ID kc8noze):\n100% this.

Open beta and early access are now really just terms for games that have been released incomplete and probably not to a good standard. If anyone who wants to can play your game you've released it. \n\nAlpha beta etc used to be testing stages in development that would tell you how close to the finished product they were. Now games release as open beta and stay that way for years taking people's money at the same time. That isn't a testing phase. That is a company trying to get money from an unfinished product. \n\nPersonally I don't think beta games should be allowed to charge. The industry is largely unregulated and it shows that these practices have become accepted and normal. And it's leads to situations like this where people have invested in something in good faith which then performs pretty poorly\n\n### Comment ID kca5c5j with +6 score by [(ImpressiveElection94, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kca5c5j/) (in reply to ID kc8yzcr):\nI agree?

While they probably had some start up money (the founders are well respected names in the Gaming industry) that money won't last forever, where do the funds come from for this long of a beta/alpha/testing? They aren't asking for a monthly fee, it's not pay to win even in whatever phase it's currently in, which I confess, is a mystery to me even now but I do recognize they ask for nothing from us. Purchasing sparkly outfits helps to keep the lights on in Palia and pay their people, you know they are hurting when they lay off 35% of their workforce and if I recall correctly they are down to just 109 workers for Palia, while 109 sounds like a lot it's really not for an Online video game, a small workforce like that can strangle a game. Outfit choices are completely optional and NOT forced on you. No one is making you purchase anything. All those people playing for free need to thank the people who do purchase the trivial things from the clothing shop, they are the ones keeping Palia alive at the end of the day. I buy their outfits and I don't even think twice about it because I enjoy the game and DO want to see it fully released and receiving updates, doesn't bother me one bit it's Beta or whatever it is currently.

As far as I know, games on the Switch are usually so ready, that they aren't Beta anymore. This game needs much more time for that. Well, I hope they get it done with the bug fixing. I really like that game and the potential for the future, so I cheer for their success.\n\n#### Comment ID kcidcfp with +2 score by [(Stealthwarfox, Reddit, 2023-12-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kcidcfp/) (in reply to ID kc9tkj6):\nThey just announced last night at the game awards it will be released on switch December 14.\n\n## Comment ID kcad7kc with +13 score by [(kwonhoshi, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kcad7kc/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nI'm sorry but it's just embarrassing to release an update that renders the game unplayable.

But beta can't excuse all the problems  Palia has. Nor 'It iS fReE!11\". It's a product above all, and it simply must have some quality in it, otherwise it's just a bad product, free or not, beta or not.\n\nGame breaking bugs that prevent progress; quests that cannot be completed; horrible climbing. Most if not all those things MUST have been fixed in closed alpha (or at least closed beta), not be present in open beta for everyone to see. It's the job of QA department to find and fix those bugs before the game or patch it released. And those guys either don't exist, do their job poorly or have very little time to do it. Then it's management fault, making devs release new  patch every two weeks. But it can't be justified by 'It's just beta!'. It's bad decisions that lead to bad state of the game and then lead to players leaving.\n\nS6 is not a small indie studio, but right now this game is playing like some Steam early access indie game from a single developer. Or even worse, indie game from Patreon.\n\nI wish all well for Palia, but its current state is bad. If it was in alpha, sure, I would have no problem with that. But in open beta? Just nope.\n\n### Comment ID kc8jfym with +7 score by [(Shoddy-Temperature16, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc8jfym/) (in reply to ID kc7tb0d):\nQA doesn't fix bugs, QA finds and documents them. From there the bug is handed off to either the dev who owns the feature the bug exists in or more like to the production/project management staff who will decide when fixing it fits into the existing timeline and schedule. QA can in most cases argue for an increase in priority for the bug but usually a bug that is not \"this crashes or prevents players from playing the game every time for all system configuration we test on\" will end up finding it's way into the backlog. \n\nAt most places I have worked QA doesn't have access to commit code, nor are they paid enough to expect them to have that skill set. If they do have those skills they either jump ship to the game engineering side of the house or go the technical test analyst/software development engineer in test route and work on writing code to automate tests or make tools to help the manual tests work faster.\n\n#### Comment ID kc8onq5 with +6 score by [(Kirful, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc8onq5/) (in reply to ID kc8jfym):\nOkay, my bad, sorry.

If we want more quests, areas, progression, recipes, NPCs, events, game growth, etc. we need to understand that this happens, happens often, and we need to take a breath and understand that they’re doing everything they can to get things going again (if only so they can get home to their families).\n\nThe other thing I tell myself is that this is a free game. I have had subscription games that were down a lot in the first year. World of Warcraft was one of them. I participated from closed Beta on in that game (until Mists where I got bored) and the first year was rough with downtime.

Where I work (not game industry) the devs roll out several upgrades for several components daily. Generally you want deployment (and rollback) to be so easy and smooth that it's not stressful to deploy just whenever.\n\n> He’s had to long hours on a time crunch and then Bam!

My objection is rolling out a sizable (in this game's history) patch with existing bugs not being addressed. Party invites being broken for the past two weeks  is very tangible. People bicker resources, especially flow, and being able to invite someone to your party would stop a lot of scolding as soon as it starts. Last I knew, the game was crashing when you clicked on a person's name to add them as a friend. These are fundamentals of the MMO model, and honestly essential to a game that markets itself as \"cozy.\" I'd honestly rather wait a week for the holiday update if we could get party invites and friend requests back. :)\n\n## Comment ID kc9sqtb with +13 score by [(relosa_, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc9sqtb/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nI am not really all that bothered by the bugs. Because it's beta. Stuff is just gonna go wrong, that's fine. I don't even care about the downtime. Am I pleased that it crashed/froze/required hard restart 5 times in one hour this morning and I couldn't fish? No. Am I terribly surprised it's *that* borked? Also no. Did I witness myself some of the QOL improvements and appreciate them? Very much yes. \n\nWhat I *do* care about is the unprofessionalism in communicating about it. It's immature and oddly self-centered and WAY too on-the-nose with the branding. What I'm about to say is in good faith because I *want* Palia to reach alpha, I *want* S6 to grow. Most are not gonna like it and will downvote because they don't understand the difference between business practices and branding.\n\nThere are specific things that *need* to be stated clearly in updates that weren't even mentioned. The website itself doesn't even have a server/game status page. Not everyone uses discord and it should not ever be the primary communications center.\n\nIf there's a major outage, planned or not, *especially* when they're the ones to pull it offline, that needs to be loud and clear on every platform they use. Scheduled outages should be sending emails as well. IMO it came across as that they *really* didn't want any new or casual players to know there was an outage at all. They *know* the daily players and community members would be on it. But it's the kind of thing you just have to own up to ASAP. \n\nContext: I have 10+ years in risk management, operations training, planning, comms, and hands-on emergency stuff.\n\nWhat their updates should have read like was:\n\n\"Hey everyone, we have some bad news. The patch release didn't go as planned and the demand on the servers plus bugs and errors clashed. We've taken everything offline and are investigating. While we're disappointed that you cannot enjoy Winterlight and the QOL fixes just yet, we understand this is probably even more disappointing for you. We'll let you know as soon as we have any information. You can find status updates at  \\[URL\\]. Thank you for your patience!\"\n\nOnce they had repairs under way and did not have an ETA:\n\n\"Good news is that we've located the issue and have begun correcting it. Unfortunately we don't yet have an estimated uptime and we'll definitely let you know when that changes. We do know that the issue was internal and your game and personal data is safe.\"\n\nClear, kind, respectful, informative, and not full of mealy-mouthed weirdly self-serving brand-speak that never once acknowledged the users except with really condescending comments like \"for those who are being patient\" and \"those who are sending positive vibes!\"\n\nMost of all, it comes across as *we have this under control.* But instead last night it came across as \"wow look at us doing our jobs! isn't that neat! boy are we tired!\" as if they were doing us a favor. \n\nFree or not, every player is still a consumer and S6 is a for-profit business. **This is their job;** no, I will not pat them on the back for doing it. Especially after getting it back online it's still having the same issues. What I *will* commend is if they manage the actual front-facing part well, which they did not. \n\nI know I'm gonna get downvoted for this but sorry, I'm right. I shared the messages with others in comms training and backgrounds. Some were Palians and some were not. I asked them what their impression was of the situation and they all came back with the same thing: short-sighted and unprofessional.\n\n This was a comms disaster. And it still is IMO. Not even mentioning the fact that the Switch thing was pulled with no information whatsoever and it hasn't been addressed as far as I know.\n\nBeta doesn't just mean the game itself but as a new and growing company it also means branding, crisis management, and retention. They are setting an extremely poor example of what happens when things might go even worse and if they do not sharpen communications they will not see the growth they deserve.\n\n### Comment ID kccmfjj with +3 score by [(BeneficialFault2269, Reddit, 2023-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kccmfjj/) (in reply to ID kc9sqtb):\nAgreed 100%. Due to how they communicate, which is poorly, they are not managing expectations correctly. \n\nThe silence around Switch not being released this year is very telling.\nThis in turn leads to frustration and bickering, especially in the Discord as this is where they announce anything instead of their own website with a status page. It's the same thing every single patch, it turns into \"remember it's only in beta guys\", \"send your love to the Devs they are working hard for us, \"if you're so upset about it/if you don't like it, then don't play/just leave\". \n\nYesterday someone upset over the Switch situation vented their frustrations in the Discord and proceeded to be bullied and talked down to with the phrases above and worse, with personal attacks just based off of their disappointment. \n\nS6 has fostered the community in this way with how passive aggressive they've been in coms previously and continues to do so with the examples you gave (for those who are being patient\" and \"those who are sending positive vibes!\"). \nIt's a very immoral practice when they're trying to act like we're besties (surprise, they want your money) and make people feel sorry for them which is weird and unprofessional.\n\nI've enjoyed the game and want it to succeed but with each patch it's getting further away from what they explained the game would be and while it has aspects of cozy, it's not hitting home in its current state.\n\n#### Comment ID kcdtp10 with +2 score by [(relosa_, Reddit, 2023-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kcdtp10/) (in reply to ID kccmfjj):\nThe exact same thing happened to me in the discord when I mentioned how unprofessional it was.

They released the game incomplete in order to generate revenue, and to justify the bugs they are calling it a beta. \n\nI will still support the game because it's fun, and I think it could really grow into something great... but it is definitely frustrating and ruins the flow of the game when I suddenly can't turn my screen properly every 10 minutes, and then fall through the floor, and then can't loot the bug I just stunned.\n\n### Comment ID kc9guf6 with +10 score by [(Twiststitch, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc9guf6/) (in reply to ID kc94gbr):\nThis. People like to say \"but it's a freeeee game\" but it's not. The game is monetized in the way S6 is planning to make money from it. Their intention is to make money and they pretty much told us they need to generate money. For all we know they need the cash to repay backers or maybe it's a condition of the Switch release (Nintendo isn't putting up the game for free) - all this \"but the devs have to eat....\" stuff is childish.\n\n#### Comment ID kc9xanw with +4 score by [(relosa_, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc9xanw/) (in reply to ID kc9guf6):\nYes, thank you!

I feel like there's some valid criticism of course after all it's frustrating to be playing a buggy and unfinished game and there's some bugs that are ok in beta and some that are game breaking. Still I'm completely with you, it's a game from a new small studio, no matter how experienced the developers are they don't have the same tools bigger companies do. And beta is their best tool to test and improve their game . I'm a software engineering masters degree student and so the bugs , the time for updates, the unfinished or not yet added features are very normal for me and don't bother me. About the game itself, since I'm busy with school I end up playing for just a few hours a day but I've identified that the game is a bit \"slow\" if you wanna play everyday all the time cus a lot of tasks take time, still there's a lot to do and I haven't explored everything yet. I love most of the objectives of the game and have a lot of fun. It really helps my mental health being so cosy and playing it so light-heartedly . I'm really excited for the festive updates and yesterday I really wanted to play cus I had just came from a test at college and ofc I was sad when they brought the servers back down. but I actually joined the discord like 2 days ago and seeing the updates...they're working, they're trying. And there's nothing more frustrating than finding bugs after fixing other bugs. So uk they're doing their best and that's all anyone can ask.\n\n### Comment ID kcah49k with +11 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kcah49k/) (in reply to ID kc8ecfw):\nCasual reminder this is not a small studio and the funding they have is pretty huge.\n\n## Comment ID kcb5vwk with +4 score by [(Er1nyes, Reddit, 2023-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kcb5vwk/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nI think Palia would benefit from a test server before releasing to the wider Palia community. Other small studios have done this with great effect. Coffee Stain who produce Valheim is a good example.\n\nAll patches were first run thru thier Public Test Server (PTS) before being released to the \"live\" server. Everyone who participated on the pts, knew thier game could be rolled back & progress lost as devs worked out kinks in each update/patch. If you were not prepared to deal with that you simply waited for the updates to go \"live\" and it is probably one of the most stable games still in early release.\n\nI don't doubt for a minute that the S6 team are working their butts off trying to get the game working but I also think they need to concentrate more on core game play before introducing new cosmetics.\n\n## Comment ID kcbjzm6 with +4 score by [(magvadis, Reddit, 2023-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kcbjzm6/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nY'all there is no test server we are the test server.\n\n## Comment ID kc7tlhg with +14 score by [(BosEriko, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc7tlhg/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nWhen people say the team is small i always remember how stardew was created by a single person.\n\n### Comment ID kc8cd26 with +9 score by [(JoanyC11, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc8cd26/) (in reply to ID kc7tlhg):\nUndertale, Rollercoaster Tycon, Stardew, among others were made by single people in ways that are simply extraordinary. But it's exactly that to make a game alone you need to be quite the programming genius, know a lot of different areas and spend probably YEARS AND YEARS developing. Programming is hard (I'm a software engineer master's degree student) and most of the times to develop an app much simpler than a game you need a few elements of a team like a front end and backend developer, a team to make the design, a team to make the unit tests etc etc. It's amazing what some people do but if we expect every studio to do extraordinary things it's like expecting every human that has experience with science to be Einstein or something. Non the less some developers are faster than others and that's ok. And sometimes we'll be frustrated cus it seems like a lot of times and it's human we just don't know how hard their working and the problems they ran into etc.\n\n### Comment ID kc7w9kz with +16 score by [(xlaauurraaa, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc7w9kz/) (in reply to ID kc7tlhg):\nI think when we talk about this, no one talks about *how* he made the game. like how he worked over 15+ hours on days, dedicated time for friends to working on the game, stayed up unhealthy hours. and he did have help, just not in the traditional sense of help, and much later into the games years. ConcernedApe dedicated his whole life to Stardew in an almost unhealthy way imo. even now, when he talks about it, you can tell he loves it, but he's sometimes so burnt out or frazzled.

Some teams have grandiose visions for 1.0 and leave on the beta label years after what is essentially 1.0. I think the only meaningful metric for a game being or not being in beta is if it is selling any sort of products - which Palia is doing.\n\nAt the end of the day I don't think it matters all that much if a game is in beta or not if you are a player and not a tester. You are rightfully upset if you have issues but you should manage your expectations against the reality of the dev team size and maturity of the game itself. Palia is a recently out beta MMO managed by a small team when it comes to MMO metrics and getting overly upset that it has issues is an error on your part. Take a break from any game if you find yourself overly upset.\n\n### Comment ID kcezam0 with +2 score by [(ImpressiveElection94, Reddit, 2023-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kcezam0/) (in reply to ID kcem21w):\nI srsly don't know what counts as small, but they seem to be around 160 people.

Yes, they are recently out in Open Beta. August was the start, right? I'd like to know, if there was something before that. Like a closed Beta or stuff. Even tho I don't believe it. \nAnyways, the game is still a baby. Some want to show their baby as soon as possible to others.

With every stage of added content we get more bugs. It is just the nature of the industry.\n\nSo I try to remember that I am playing a game that is only 1/4 or 1/3 done. If it gets too buggy I suspend play until I read it has improved. I only get upset when some bug has an impact on my character or account achievement or development and it cannot be reversed or fixed eventually. Like an achievement that doesn't trigger.

Been waiting over 4/5 years for the completion of the game! Rejuvenation I meant \n\nPlease Note: I am sober writing this post but let my past experience gaming flow here! Lol!\n\nPalia is a good game, it has A LOT OF POTENTIAL, but it also has a few things that works against it: \n\nLet's start with the paid feature- the store items are too expensive. With or without the pet as an added bonus. If you spread out the costs a little more then people may be inclined to buy more. I don't have any original ideas but others may. \n\nGame play: between the main plot objectives the game gets a bit boring, but then again maybe I Have been playing it wrong because hunting for bugs or fishing may be optional but I'm too stupid to get that whole system- would rather hunt.\n\nTransport/travel: Now as Palia is a magical world without too much technology to ruin the aesthetics it still is a medium sized map (compared to Fallout 4) tiny compared to Minecraft and the Witcher 1 and small compared to Rejuvenation and Reborn.  That being said I became totally enthralled with the idea of (DON'T LAUGH) Hunting Down a MYTHICAL STAG/Bear to RIDE AROUND! Which adds another opportunity for more shop items! Even being able to customize that stag or bear brings a whole new bag of opportunity and problems.  \n\nPuzzles: I love solving puzzles and just hunting down some items that give more lore to the environment: Like what is it with the white structures scattered throughout Palia? Where has the former tenant of your plot of land gone? Is he truly nuts or was he DaVinci or Einstein or Galileo of the Palia universe?   \n\nFishing: I hate the system but then again I don't like that feature in rejuvenation either. But don't take it out I guess I am just a bit stiff about it. Just need to get used to it \n\nBuildings: I like the system you currently have, things clip easily and although it is limited it has great potential- I would just add some rounded structures and an option for top floors and stairs, heck a floor with a hole and a pole to swing down! Vines to climb up and down!  \n\nFurniture use: I don't know I would like to be able to store clothes in a cupboard, Like say I just bought a pink party dress and a green Elvin hunting set of clothes I want to open the cupboard and see them in there, but again don't stress this too much- none of the games I played got this right either!  Which neatly brings me over to the library: I would love to browse and buy books- recipes and bestiaries, I don't know maybe checklists for maybe the bugs and fish you collect with more information per the species you've encountered area they are available in with a spot on the map, time and the kind of fishing rod and bait required? \n\nQuests: Please forgive me but there are times that the dialogue plays and something happens in real life that makes you skip the dialogue by accident: cat jumps on the keyboard, baby slaps the mouse etc. and lets say that dialogue was important but you cannot go back and revisit that conversation which means you've missed something important to the story line or a hint as to where you are to go but a list of DETAILED explanations on the quest may be good for this, I had to go look at Wiki, Google, Reddit and YouTube way too many times as some of the quest descriptions are too vague or do not give you enough information from the get-go. Or add lines and optional clues in character dialogues. \n\nRarity of resources: Now this one may be interesting- bear with me: \n\nFallout 4 has a few medicines that are EXTREMELY RARE: X-Cell, Day Tripper, AND Daddy-O. Minecraft has diamonds that were extremely rare before the newest update, Craft the World has Heroes, Pokémon Rejuvenation and Reborn have Event and Legendary Pokémon: Now bare in mind I haven't really played long enough to completely say I have a handle on what is Really Rare- except for Pallium but this also has an exploit which takes away from it's rare status. May I suggest you remove the Group bonus feature from mining this RARE ingredient? As far as I understand it is Rare for a reason? \n\nFood crafting- I want to be able to see the food I make on a plate (not sure if it's in game but I haven't really explored food crafting too much either), Can I ask that one could be able to buy them from the library too?   \n\nRelationship status: Okay Now THIS was WHAT MADE ME QUIT!  You are told to find a shepp- THAT'S IT!  \n\nYou are not told that \n\n1) YOU CANNOT ASK ANYONE with a FRIENDSHIP LEVEL BELOW LEVEL 4 to be your shepp as they Will REFUSE YOU \n\n2) You cannot ask an NPC to be your Shepp more than ONCE  and Finally\n\n3) The Shepp option is ALWAYS available in the dialogue options thus if you get tired of their drivel and skip too quickly through their dialogue you have a VERY HIGH CHANCE OF Accidently asking them to be your Shepp  and all your hard work is GONE! \n\nFallout 4 has done this dialogue option EXTREMELY well by limiting WHAT you can say to which character at different relationship levels. I am sorry I am not going through all the ups and downs of building up a relationship level again. The characters that I was interested in becoming my Shepp I made the mistake of asking too early. The others bore me to tears or irritate me enough to try shoot them with the bow and arrows (doesn't work) \n\nNow please note I wrote this with a light-hearted approach and I mean this as constructive criticism. All and all I would love to play Palia again- I like the game, but as to the shepp quest- I asked and cannot ask again so this is a wall for me in the game and I won't be returning until that is resolved. \n\nNeither will I pay to play either.\n\n### Comment ID kca3kdl with +1 score by [(ImpressiveElection94, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kca3kdl/) (in reply to ID kc92o0n):\nFirst I'd like to thank you for the time you took to write all this! 😶 And don't worry, I think of it like constructive criticism.\nNow let's get started:\n\nTo the monetization I can't say much about a better approach besides that it may have been a bit too soon, if you think about the progress of the game. I think many might not consider it \"worthy\" of getting money as of now. Me included. As soon as I get the feeling that the game gets \"completed\", I might buy stuff. But that should take time, with what I've seen up till now. But then again, I see many in fancy costumes,  so it might work out after all? How to switch the numbers for more people to buy stuff is something I can't even imagine. I'm just too poor to buy stuff higher than 20€ without batting an eye.\n\nGame play might be repetitive very fast as there isn't much story quests right now, but I'm pretty sure they'll add more. Like more ressources in each category to farm and stuff. I don't think they'll change the system as I think they want the players to be able to do just what they enjoy. At least to a certain extent. You need to mine to make your axe better and stuff. But I think that's pretty normal in games. I find the game cozy and chill besides the bugs.\n\nTransport and Travel: Ooooh, I'd LOVE that!!!\n\nPuzzles: I love puzzles, too! I think some might come with new ruins, but I'd love small ones in the overworld, too!\n\nBuildings: Yes, PLEASE! Especially stairs, as soon as I built just one additional room I wanted it!\n\nLibrary: Yes, that would be great. I wouldn't be surprised, if they already considered it for the future. \n\nStory: Yes, I feel you! Even if I saw everything,  there are times I'd like to be able to look up what was said again. Hope they add something like that. \n\nRessources: There's a group bonus for mining? I know that fishing has it and foraging Flowtrees requires you to have someone tag along if it is a fully grown tree, but mining? I might have missed something? I'm still not a veteran in this game, so there might be things I just don't know. \n\nFood: You can place star quality food in your farm! On tables, in fridges, basically everywhere with a designated surface for putting stuff on/in it.\n\nNow I get back to the clothes as it's already possible with food, so making that available for clothes would be great! Just dunno how much work that is,  as I'm no programmer...\n\nRelationship: Yes, it's not really stated that you need friendship Level 4, before they'll become your Shepp.\nBUT!: You aren't lost! You can still get the person to be your Shepp even though you asked to early! I panicked with Tish as I asked her and the option to ask just disappeared. But through the community I got to know that when you reach Level 4 with your target person and complete the quest for that, after an in-game day the option reappears and you can get your Shepp! Again, it's not stated in-game. I'd like to be informed about both cases (knowing Shepp condition and that you can ask again after Level 4 Quest) in-game.\n\nI hope that alleviates your anxiety, which I felt, too and was really, REALLY unsettling for me, and you can enjoy the game more knowing you can still get your Shepp!\n\n\n\n## Comment ID kc8wzw1 with +1 score by [(Terrynia, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc8wzw1/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nIm ok with the performance issues… now whwre is my Christmas store 🤣😂🤣😂\n\n## Comment ID kcaaztu with +1 score by [(YoshiandAims, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kcaaztu/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nBeta is a grind.

      "# Post ID 15qc2j1: The moderation and community on Discord are TERRIBLE. with +101 score by [(BrettGrell, Reddit, 2023-08-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15qc2j1/the_moderation_and_community_on_discord_are/)\nAs if the lackluster state of the beta was not enough, Palia's discord is among the worst communities I have ever been a part of. The culture of \"inclusivity and coziness\" they are trying to cultivate has failed, and it has failed miserably. A big part of this the fault of the way their discord is moderated. I want to be very clear that I'm not trying to bash the moderators as people, but as moderators, they are terrible at what they do. \n\nThere was a discussion in the discord today about non-English speaking members of their community and how they are unable to advertise or speak in their native language. This is something I am very passionate about. I completely understand that it is an arduous task moderating multiple languages, and it is okay to not have the resources for that *at this time.* However, not having an outlet to direct non-English speaking members is completely unacceptable. The posts in the channel where people advertise their communities and the discords associated with them are *not able to be editted.* Why can a moderator not run the post through google translate once it is up to make sure it says nothing nefarious, and then people that come in speaking that language can be directed to that post? The shoddy translation for other languages in this game looks as if it has been run through google translate, so why are you unable to do it for community posts just once? It blows my mind.\n\nMultiple members of the Singularity 6 defense force then decided to tell me that \"moderators are volunteers.\" This has been declared multiple times by community managers that this is not the case. They are paid professional moderators. Even after showing the quote directly from said community manager, members were jumping through hoops to defend this development studio that can supposedly do no wrong. \"Just because they are not professionals does not mean they are paid,\" one stated, when it has been said explicitly, multiple times that being a moderator is a professional, **paid** role. In the middle of this disagreement, a moderator was coming in and reminding everyone \"to please keep it friendly!\" You know what would have instantly settled the conversation? **By telling them that moderation is a paid role.** Rather than just saying that and settling this disagreement like a sensible person, they let the conversation persist, and warn/ban other people saying that moderation was a paid role. Is this a secret?? Are we not supposed to know that? The way Singularity 6 tries to control every narrative and every conversation about their game is truly concerning. I would not be surprised if they find reason to lock this thread.\n\nIt has been shown multiple times in the discord that innocuous arguments and comments are treated more harshly than bigotry and dogwhistles. We have watched transphobic people have their messages removed, but not be banned or muted. How is that cozy? \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15onv0k/about\\_the\\_discordpost\\_was\\_removed\\_revising\\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15onv0k/about_the_discordpost_was_removed_revising_and/)\n\nI have been a member of the community for years, and been very passionate about wanting this game to go in the right direction. The staff at Singularity6 and the moderators in the discord have proven that this game and its community is not what it has been advertised as. It is heartbreaking watching Palia fall even further from grace. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Comment ID jw2cve5 with +100 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-08-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15qc2j1/the_moderation_and_community_on_discord_are/jw2cve5/) (in reply to ID 15qc2j1):\nBecause feedback ✨doesn’t matter✨ and it doesn’t help the ✨game✨ /s\n\n### Comment ID jw2l8gc with +45 score by [(Temporary_Lawyer_938, Reddit, 2023-08-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15qc2j1/the_moderation_and_community_on_discord_are/jw2l8gc/) (in reply to ID jw2cve5):\nThey removed the recently highly upvoted topic about the issues with discord under the \"rule 6-respect the devs\" rule.

There seems to be no criticism allowed. People are still in a honeymoon state with the game it seems and I think alot of people soon will realize, that the game in its current state is still very empty. I try to love the game. I really do. When I first heard of Palia, I was thinking, that this is the game I ll play for years, as it pretty much includes everything I want in a game and then its even an MMO. Or atleast thats how they advertised the game. What concerns me the most, is that the game hasnt really made any progress in the last 2 years according to some alpha and pre alpha players I met on my journey so far. So I wonder how much progress to the game we will see in the future. They already made their money with the kickstarter campaign and I doubt that a purely cosmetic shop will bring in enough revenue for them to not abandon the game in the near future. Whats also sending redflags to me, is how often I read on the discord, that S6 consists of ex Riot, Blizzard and other big player employees. The code of the game is pretty much spaghetti. There is no server side validation on alot of things. In public cheating communities they already found ways to get premium outfits, duplicate items, get unlimited money/renown etc. which clearly should not be possible, if you have a team full of veteran developers from the biggest mmo's in history.\n\n### Comment ID jw49hfv with +9 score by [(RexZShadow, Reddit, 2023-08-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15qc2j1/the_moderation_and_community_on_discord_are/jw49hfv/) (in reply to ID jw3u3tf):\n>They already made their money with the kickstarter campaign\n\nAs fyi they did not do a kickstarter. They are entire funded by investors which probably explain why they are releasing the game unfinished because its bee 5 years and $49 million of the investors money so they probably asking questions. And most likely this was the promised launch date when they did the pitch to the investors.\n\nWell being from Riot and Blizzard means nothing really beside marketing pitch. Its like what were their job at Riot and Blizzard? If they were all junior devs there incharge of small tasks then it means jack shit. How many of them were in lead role making big decision or solving difficult tech issues? There not many of those on a team and those are the people that would matter when you say from Riot or Blizzard.\n\nOne pitfall of huge development teams is everyone get too specialized and that experience is hard to translate to new projects. I know Riot is well know for this where they have so many people and everyone is so specialized on what they do.\n\n## Comment ID jw2kx5g with +43 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-08-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15qc2j1/the_moderation_and_community_on_discord_are/jw2kx5g/) (in reply to ID 15qc2j1):\nMeh let the mods be shills and let S6 ignore the feedback that actually needs reading.\n\nWatch it bite them in the ass down the road.\n\n### Comment ID jw3k379 with +14 score by [(ExNihiloNihiFit, Reddit, 2023-08-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15qc2j1/the_moderation_and_community_on_discord_are/jw3k379/) (in reply to ID jw2kx5g):\nExactly!

E.g. There is no unique plushie locked behind completing this activity. Completing the course is more about earning a sense of accomplishment and being able to show that off than any other reward.\"*\n\nHowever, now in December 2023, they have released the Temple of Gales which is.... the tower in different packaging with both main storyline and unique rewards locked behind it (and like the tower, there are no save points).  \\[edit: you have to complete the temple to unlock the vault bundles which are what actually gives you the unique rewards.\\]\n\nWith the understanding that Singularity6 is not looking at Reddit for feedback, what are your thoughts on this?\n\nPersonally, one of my medical conditions effects my occipital nerve and one of the symptoms is... vertigo.  While it's manageable in Kilima and Bahari, it's not manageable in The Tower or in the Temple of Gales.  I highly suspect it's because those places are in a void where you cannot see the ground/water to help you judge any kind of distance. Just use the persistent center triangle you say? Doesn't work even a tiny bit.  Well what about the adjusting the field of view?  Also does not work, and I have to reinstall my game after any adjustment to it because any change to the field of few results in weirdly unproportionate squished things.Aside from myself, I have seen people taking about being unable to do the Temple of Gales due to  hand problems (Arthritis & Fibromyalgia) as well as due to the in-game instructions not being clear enough for people with cognitive issues (Multiple Sclerosis, Fibromyalgia, and medication side-effects).\n\nI know there were a lot of people, including myself, who submitted feedback to the devs via [support.palia.com](https://support.palia.com) \\> requests > Palia feedback and choosing the accessibility dropdown regarding this when The Tower was released so they could better understand the nature of disabilities that would lock people out of areas such as these... and I won't speak for everyone of course, but from what I am seeing being said, there's a good contingent of the disabled Palia community that is feeling lied to right now.\n\nOf course, rarely will a company ever be perfect in their inclusivity!  However, Palia is doing exactly what they said they would NOT do:  putting unique rewards & storyline behind an area that \\[edit: ~~not everyone can participate in.~~   is like The Tower.  However, my having a disability that is directly challenged by this tower-like new temple is clouding my thoughts on the issue, which is why I'm looking for thoughts on the matter. /edit  -- edit of the edit: Yep, I know that makes the title of the post a little click-baity, but I can't edit it now... sorry not sorry.\\]\n\n## Comment ID kcrxvoa with +20 score by [(Unit-Fickle, Reddit, 2023-12-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kcrxvoa/) (in reply to ID 18ewr01):\nI haven’t played for a few days.

When we spend a lot of time at home, we do our best to  make the time we spend there as enjoyable as we can.  I love Palia and have bought 3 outfits and a glider skin so far, and I wanted to buy more... but right now my progress in the main storyline is halted because of a lack of an accessibility option...  so why would I buy more?*\n\n *I sincerely beg of you to improve the accessibility options in Palia. Open a better dialogue with disabled players. There are very simple solutions that will make this game an even more beloved experience.*  \n\n*Thank you.* \n\nWe should be flooding their feedback forums. Make more noise.  We shouldn't have to do this, but if we want to be included in this game we may need to do this.

But then, at the same time, I can't in good conscience even do that because it's immediately advertised as not being looked at in the least by the devs.\n\nWorth a good discussion with others that you likely won't get here or on most other channels on the discord, but yeah, it's rough. There's a lot of people who don't realize that accessibility is part of being inclusive. And I can already see that with a quick scroll down in the replies here.\n\nIt might help, at least, to talk to people in the same situation on that channel on the discord, despite the whole issue where they're not...really looking.

The upvote ratio on the main post isn't great... but I did put the word disability in the title, which is enough for many people to downvote on alone.

The new temple was... Really frustrating. I'm the type of person that, once I hyperfixiate on something I HAVE to finish it, but the game itself makes it such a frustrating experience 😭\n\nThere's no mini map. This is already a problem in the open world, but in the temple it was even worse! Yes you get used to it after hours of being stuck there, but I still have problems with getting around, cuz my brain has the memory of a fly. A mini map would REALLY help. We can't even open up a map here under M!\n\nSome stuff isn't explained well or thought out well.\nGetting the evidence for Caleri and Elouisa was really frustrating! While it does check off that you found them, if you're stuck with, let's say two missing for each and being lost in this huge place, you will lose track of whivh you already have unlocked... Maybe after a while there should be hints on where to find the last ones. Or maybe there should be indicators for which you have already found!\nI found myself running to the same ones because I kept forgetting which was for who... I ended up having to use help from the discord (there was this lovely person taking screenshots of the locations, thank you!).\n\nSome of the objects for Zeki's treasure hunt are at awful places (like the gold chapaa figure). It's especially frustrating when the climbing, which is already pretty bugged on the normal map, doesn't work well in the temple at all. Personally I didn't have those huge climbing bugs like others did, thankfully, but the experience itself is not great :( climbing was not really smooth. Sometimes you fall down, slide down, get stuck or invisible walls... Etc etc.\n\nWhile I did have fun the first hour I was playing (in itself I think the temple would be a fun experience), all those frustrating bits keep piling up and make it... Not fun. It wouldn't register the last Elouisa evidence for me so I had to relog, which helped but it kicked me out of the temple and straight to Bahari central stables.. I had to run all the way back 😭\n\nI can't even imagine how this experience must be for someone with a disability. I really hope they can work on this!\n\n#### Comment ID keq0vq0 with +4 score by [(StunningEducation982, Reddit, 2023-12-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/keq0vq0/) (in reply to ID kcrcf44):\nI'm the same way. I also have adhd and hyperfixate and the lack of mini maps is an absolute hell I can't express. \nAnd I'm not sure if this is just a part of the adhd, but sometimes I feel like I have mild dyslexia so I prefer when devs do immersive tutorializing and *showing* the player where to go rather than text tutorials (like in the fire temple where it's mostly visual cues), because I tend to mix up the words anyway.\n\nI tend to like to try finding everything on my own but it was wholly impossible for me. And after watching a YouTube walk-through, I know for sure I would have never found all of the eggs or treasures just based on some of the locations being a sort of \"stand here and turn the camera this way\" optical illusion. Yeah. I have not the patience nor the attention span for that. And my adhd symptoms are compiled with Toddler Mom brain at that 😂 \n\nI think this temple was clever, but maybe not very intuitive\n\n### Comment ID kcr2qgu with +6 score by [(peppermintblue, Reddit, 2023-12-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kcr2qgu/) (in reply to ID kcqznlg):\nYea, buy the time I got through the dialogue for the instructions...

I went off them earlier this year after taking them for over 20 years....  yea.... things are rough right now.... lol), but I absolutely feel what you are saying here.   Only difference for me is that the vertigo is the more immediate problem as I can't look for those eggs when I can't even get off the 1st island.    \n\n\nThere absolutely needs to be be a way to revisit the instructions.  A map would be nice because I could maybe be able to look at my navigation bar at the marker for where I'm going to and how many feet.

It did not explain really what we are supposed to be doing, and then I get to the end and I suddenly had quests I didn't really know I was doing in the background of the main egg quest. And now I'm procrastinating going back to find the other things because there is nothing in game telling us where we might be able to find all of these hidden and hard to see items. I will have to scour every inch of those islands to find everything and it feels like a chore.\n\nOther quests do this, too. The language in a lot of dialogues that give you a quest are not very clear. I've had to sort of guess at some things. I did not even know until I went back to them that the statues gave you things for renown. The game does not give us much in the way of telling us what is even going on. Maybe they could make the journal entries for quests way more specific to avoid the immersive dialog.\n\n### Comment ID kcuosl6 with +5 score by [(peppermintblue, Reddit, 2023-12-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kcuosl6/) (in reply to ID kcsribs):\nThe wiki, playthroughs, and asking chat quickly became my friends when it came to doing most of the quests.

My boyfriend, lucky for him, never faced any difficulty climbing, but, I was being stubborn and continued to try, but after a few moments, it was \\*not\\* going to end well. So, I had to call it a day. After they fixed that, I was still having trouble, due to trying to find the books, the treasures, the eggs. There's so much, scattered around \\*so many far flung spaces\\*. No minimap, or even a regular map. Even using guides, you have to watch the guide through, because if something is skipped, you have no idea \\*where\\* a spot is, if they're in a different spot than you are. The area is so darned large, and a lot of spots look so similar. It's also entirely \\*too easy\\* to fall and be sent back to square one... Over, and over, and over.\n\nMy boyfriend got in done in a couple hours, at most. I've been at it for... Six hours, now, I think? Probably more. From yesterday, and today. And I still have one book to find, three treasures, and the final island to explore. I'm taking a break from it because my frustration was getting the best of me, and my body just can't take that.\n\nI am a FFXIV player, who does use accessibility options and I do have friends help me (such as turning off spell effects, having call outs , etc), so I'm used to knocking my head against a wall.

I'm an able-bodied player, and I'm so stuck on this temple. Found my 10 eggs and was so proud! Then I found that I'm at 3/4 for both Elouisa and Caleri. And only 2 of Zeki's treasures. I've been here at least a couple hours, and it stopped being fun. For me, the biggest pain point is the lack of a map to keep track of where I've not been yet, and a lack of tracking where I did find things, so I can quit looking there. Or ask for help and know which ones I don't need. For now, I'm breaking for some food, and then I guess I'll find someone's walkthrough.

I have to give my account a friend to catch fish or have her by me to catch bugs because I cannot switch tools that fast. our time playing together is fun but i just feel so bad when i finally found a legendary fish and its even with hok and other boosters to fast for me. I know they cant make the game only easy because the broad mass is people without any problems but i for my part decided not to give them any money till its the cozy game for everyone they promised. Right now i feel lied too on so many points. Make it at least coop-able in such situations would be a way or make quests that give rare bugs or fish so that over time everyone can finish those collections. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe is asking a friend to do it is a possibility for you\n\n### Comment ID kdhb0xu with +1 score by [(SaltInstitute, Reddit, 2023-12-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kdhb0xu/) (in reply to ID kctcwjx):\nSo glad to see I'm not the only one who's struggling with fishing. Well, not glad you also struggle, but glad it's not *just* me. It got slightly better for me after one of the recent patches (now I miss about 1 catch in 3 or 4 instead of every other catch), but it's still a struggle to catch many fish... even with the best rod and health boosters on top. Especially the ones with super sudden, unpredictable patterns of movement. Fish that I've seen often and have slower movements I can anticipate a little, but for the other fish... I do *not* have the processing speed or motor coordination to, all at the same time, parse that *and* move the mouse around *and* long-click/release accordingly, for the length of time it takes to reel the fish in. Already submitted feedback to the devs about this exact thing a while back. It's really turned me off of fishing -- My partner loves to go fish for fun, I fish whenever I see a bubble spot on my other errands and ignore it the rest of the time.

There are so many quests in this game that I feel are really limiting. Like I don't think I'll ever meet the new npc. I can't cook to save my life so cooking the 3 recipes needed to meet her is impossible for me and doing them in a party is not comfortable either for me due to my schizoaffective disorder.

I'm somewhat lucky in the fact that I used to LOVE really hard platforming games (Super Meat Boy, Celeste, etc), so I kind of have that going for me with stuff like this. I still enjoy those sorts of games, but they're harder to do now with the carpal tunnel syndrome. I've still only gotten to just before the end of the third level of The Tower because of it. I'm hoping it's easier to maneuver on the Switch. I opted to just stop trying in the meantime, because it was really stressing me out.\n\nI found that I didn't struggle with the platforming or getting around the temple once they fixed the climbing issue, but I absolutely did have to look up guides to find some of the evidence I was missing for Caleri and a couple of the treasures. I really enjoyed the temple and thought it was beautiful to look at, but it was really easy to get turned around. I hadn't really thought about it until this thread, but I use the wiki CONSTANTLY, because some of that information isn't easily accessible in the game. \n\nFor example, once you catch a bug/fish, it would be helpful to have an in-game almanac that tells you where/when to find it and what bait to use. It would also be nice if the NPC profiles showed you their general likes as well. I like that the weekly favorite items aren't known until you are close enough with them to ask them about it, because that feels realistic to me, and those DO show up in the NPC profiles once you find out what they are. Having stuff to refer back to later, and having more thoroughly explained quest steps would be really helpful, I think. I never really thought about just how often I use the wiki, and that I probably shouldn't have to. That said, I used the wiki with Stardew a fair bit too, particularly for remembering gifts the NPCs liked. I guess I'm just used to using a wiki or guides for most games. I hadn't really considered that it was an accessibility issue, but it's definitely related to my ADHD.\n\nWith regards to general difficulty, I actually really like how Stardew handles fishing. It kind of sucks initially, but as you catch more basic fish and level the skill, not only do you get better equipment, but the actual fishing mechanic gets NOTICEABLY easier. By the time you hit level 10, it's so much more manageable. I don't know that S6 is planning to have any kind of level cap on skills, but given that you get trophies at 25 and 50, I think those milestones would be a good time to implement some kind of buff that slows the fish down and makes them easier to catch, kind of like how sticky smoke bombs slow down bugs. \n\nLike, it makes sense for there to still be at least a little challenge for rarer fish, but some kind of level-based ability to make it easier would be really helpful, especially for people who struggle with the mechanic. I know there are items you can equip with effects that can help with that, but you can only equip one at a time, and sometimes it's more than one issue making the fishing difficult. Like, if you could get a permanent buff that increases both rod health and safe zone size, it would make a big difference, I think.\n\nSpeaking of fishing, is anyone else having the glitch where the reticle is just... Gone? It's not showing up for me, so I've just been trying to match the fish's movements as much as possible, and I keep losing really easy fish, when I can normally catch rare/epic ones without too much stress. It's getting really frustrating. 🙃 I'll have to see if it's on the known issues list and submit a ticket if it's not.\n\n### Comment ID kcz5r8w with +3 score by [(fembecca, Reddit, 2023-12-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kcz5r8w/) (in reply to ID kcuz11q):\nI have that bug, but not all the time.

I have rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, panic disorder, general anxiety, and depression. I also get vertigo really badly from temple situations. Mind you, there's more going on with me. But these are the things that most affect game play for me. I've been using an Xbox One controller to play because keyboard and mouse is simply too difficult to control. I think this makes it a bit easier to manage. But not by much. My hands don't work properly because of the RA and psoriasis. I flat out can't finish this temple. The movements required are too much for me. My anxiety flares up badly too. I had to take my emergency meds on top of my daily meds just to not have a panic attack. Then I feel like a failure because it's something my brain tells me I should be able to do. Which is where the depression comes into play. I'm a mess over this temple. The ables just don't get it.  \n\n\nI get that most solutions that would work for us would suck for the ables. They're the majority so devs always cater to them. Since this is a community minded game, I feel there is an easy solution that wouldn't completely exclude us. If there was a way to \"hire\" an adventurer to run the temple for you. Similar to asking the community for gifts. They get a reward for assisting, we get the temple rewards. Yes I know, this isn't exactly the win we deserve. But it would be a way to get the rewards without having to deal with the headache. I'm at the point in my life where I'm willing to take the small wins where I can get them. Even if it isn't the prize I really want.\n\n### Comment ID kczj8po with +3 score by [(peppermintblue, Reddit, 2023-12-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kczj8po/) (in reply to ID kcy6t0l):\nI have been diagnosed with occipital neuralgia (permanent), trigeminal neuralgia (transient), fibromyalgia  (permanent), and mixed migraines  (permanent)... I'll be working on getting diagnoses in the new year for possible ADD/ADHD (self-test positive), ASD (self-test positive), and CPTSD... so I may not have those exact disorders, or could have false-positive self-tests.  I wanted to share that with you because of your openness about your diagnoses.  <3\n\nI feel absolutely everything you said in your reply.  The feeling like a failure part really resonates with me... I'm just lucky that I'm really good at telling myself that it's a game and this game should not make me feel like a failure because it's supposed to be accessible -- they said it was inclusive. And then having that spin me into a hyper-obsessive advocacy campaign.   At least I am legitimately enjoying the discussion that my post is generating. \n\nThings that make the game accessible for us don't have to suck for the able-bodied.  There can be a small prize for doing it the hard way, because I totally accept that for me to complete certain things in the game is by doing it the \"easy\" way.   If you do it the hard way, reward that with a relatively inconsequential item. I suggest Zeki coins.  They are bought at a high gold cost, but sell for an extremely low amount.  As well, they can get you either a reward that's high value (furniture/plushie), but they can also give you something absolutely useless (non-flare fireworks). \n\nI love your idea of including some kind of system that rewards assisting!  It would really help build the Palia community's multiplayer aspect.  Perhaps some kind of merit points rewarded when you share a resource with other people, and those points could be redeemed for something like... Zeki Coins.     \n\n\nI'm getting bored of small wins and for now I have the drive (it's a miracle) to aim for a slight bigger one.  Even if it's just more transparency.\n\n### Comment ID kcz6chi with +2 score by [(fembecca, Reddit, 2023-12-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kcz6chi/) (in reply to ID kcy6t0l):\nThere's a comment thread somewhere in the early posts that some of us sort of collaborated on regarding a way to make this accessible for many more people.

There are very simple solutions that will make this game an even more beloved experience.*  \n\n*Thank you.* \n\nWe should be flooding their feedback forums. Make more noise.  We shouldn't have to do this, but if we want to be included in this game we may need to do this.   Feel free to copy my feedback if you're not up to writing you own, but you should include your personal experience on one of the specific accessibility issues feedback choices in any capacity you feel you can.\n\n#### Comment ID kcuiz58 with +5 score by [(Kitannia-Moonshadow, Reddit, 2023-12-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kcuiz58/) (in reply to ID kcuhju3):\nAgree completely.

I didn't even know that I was suppose to turn on the teleport for the other characters until I had completed half the temple, meaning I had to go back to it and do stuff. Not a huge thing but it was frustrating. I luckily haven't really experienced a lot of bugs with climbing, but I do know that for some people it's unplayable because of them. \n\nI do want to ask, as I haven't finished it quite yet as I still have things to find, what unique rewards are there? All I've found are >!treasure chests and the items to give to zeki!<none of which are unique? (perhaps I'm misunderstanding what you mean by unique?) I do get the story aspect though. It's not a deep-dive into lore or anything, but it's still interesting story I wish was accessible without looking it up.\n\n### Comment ID kcrg5st with +8 score by [(peppermintblue, Reddit, 2023-12-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kcrg5st/) (in reply to ID kcra420):\nYou can't complete the vault without completing the temple first.

I've even seen the game as a whole be outright called a platform game more than once in the comments, which is not how it's advertised.\n\nI'm glad you had an easy time with the temple.  I wish they offered an alternative when it comes to main storyline content.  One of the solutions talked about in this thread was that Zeki says something about giving you a Zeki coin on your own... so you go try, but if you fail a number of times you can go back and cop to not being able to do it... then he has to look into a new solution and locks you out of the temple for a number of Palian days... after that, he has you do a quest or something to pick up a device for your glider that will make it so that you can just fly across.     And with that suggestion, can I ask, how would it make someone going across on their own matter less?  They still got more than I would using the alternative questline.  \n\n\nAnd yes, I do agree that it all boils down to capitalism.

Moving between zones will, naturally, spawn you in and out of shards of that zone. Over time as the game learns your preferences and interactions it will assign you weightings for matching with other people. Part of this weighting will of course be things like friends lists and community membership, but it will also be things like progression and gameplay style.\n\nWhat this means is that in the early days, you may not regularly see the same players initially, as the game begins to adjust to you (and of course big influx of new players meaning theres a lot of variety there to be experienced by mixing everyone together) however once the game DOES begin to adjust to you, and you begin to join communities and add friends, you'll start seeing that regularity occur naturally.\n\n### Comment ID jt5dj00 with +4 score by [(AmityCrow, Reddit, 2023-07-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/156t73t/answering_some_questions_i_have_seen/jt5dj00/) (in reply to ID jt43azi):\nBoth good points, the game is being developed to be cross play with Nintendo Switch. They have a 25 player hard cap on how many people can be connected at one time to one instance or layer. I believe this player limit per layer was set just to make it easier and to allow cross play across switch and pc. \n\nSo yes you could run into the same people you meet on your layer the next time, but there is a chance I don't know how often or when it happens that when you leave said layer and come back that you could be put into a different layer with different people. With the friend system you could always add people and invite one another to each other's layer. But there is no way as far as I know to select a layer on login you are just thrown into one. \n\nThe ability to keep seeing the same people on other MMOs is you all are on the same Server/Realm Cluster  depending on population and how many layers are running at the time you are  more Likely to run into said players and recognize them.   \nSince Palia has no server select system you could very well run into the same people since everyone is in the same pool of people, just depends on how many people are playing and how many layers are running.\n\n## Comment ID jt1asqv with +3 score by [(Hopeful_Jellyfish_12, Reddit, 2023-07-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/156t73t/answering_some_questions_i_have_seen/jt1asqv/) (in reply to ID 156t73t):\nOn the housing thing, can we have two houses on one plot?

You have your main house in a certain style then you can manage and add different addons to the main house.  \nAs far as I am aware there is no way to have 2 Separate houses on one plot. Other then the starter tent.  So in a sense your Daughter could have her own 'room' extension on the one house on your plot but not a separate house.  \n\n\nThere has been a lot of people asking for community housing in the game for things like this to where people could be around others but have their own house plot right next to neighbors, but that is not currently a thing and we don't know if it ever will be.\n\n#### Comment ID jt3ye6c with +3 score by [(Maclimes, Reddit, 2023-07-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/156t73t/answering_some_questions_i_have_seen/jt3ye6c/) (in reply to ID jt1nyd6):\nMan, that is such a huge disappointment, and possibly a flat-out deal breaker. The entire reason I was looking forward to this game was to recapture the vibes of other co-op cozy games like Stardew Valley and the more recent Roots of Pacha. Both allow you and friends to have your own homes, all open and visible and neighborly within a shared village.\n\nSee, one of the things that makes this work for my family and I is that we all like different things. I like the organized minutia of farming and breeding, my son likes bashing things, and my wife likes decorating and foraging and fishing. So we all go off and do our own things, gathering the resources that are in our wheelhouse, and then return home together to work on our village, where we are neighbors. We can do community-type projects, like working on barns or clearing fields, or we can just beautify our own homes, knowing that we all still get to see and enjoy the things we've done.\n\nBut this sounds weirdly lonely, which sounds kinda ironic for a game built on being an \"MMO\" and community. The only thing we can really do together is gather resources, which is the one thing we DON'T generally do together.\n\nMaybe it'll still work. One of us chooses to sacrifice having a home in exchange for having a communal space we all work on together? Maybe it can still work. Plus maybe we'll be able to go on adventures together? Perhaps? This is a very nebulous sweet spot, and certainly hard to predict the \"vibe\". I'm not even sure I properly described why it doesn't sound right for us, but I know it doesn't *feel* right. The one thing I can say is that we for sure will try it out, because hey! It's free! If we love it, awesome! If not, well, we didn't lose anything by trying!\n\nPossible solutions:\n\n* Multiple buildings on one lot. I didn't even know that wasn't a thing until this comment, and assumed that was our solution. Oops.\n* \"Guild\" shared space. Allow players to form guilds, and have an instanced neighborhood with a central plot and a handful of satellite plots. Everyone could be neighbors, with private homes AND communal space, and all of it would feel like it was \"together\".\n\n#### Comment ID jt25xb7 with +1 score by [(Grepst3r, Reddit, 2023-07-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/156t73t/answering_some_questions_i_have_seen/jt25xb7/) (in reply to ID jt1nyd6):\nYou are also able to own at least 2 plots and you can share permissions so as AmityCrow mentioned you will be able to share the plot.\n\n### Comment ID jt1bxu1 with +1 score by [(mikeytlive, Reddit, 2023-07-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/156t73t/answering_some_questions_i_have_seen/jt1bxu1/) (in reply to ID jt1asqv):\nI don’t necessarily know.  But I don’t think so in the regard you want.\n\nYou could build 2 small homes on 1 plot. \n\nSo you can have multiple plots though. So 1 plot for yourself, and 1 plot for you and your daughter type deal. \n\nHopefully this helps!\n\n## Comment ID jt45r5d with +3 score by [(miramiiira, Reddit, 2023-07-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/156t73t/answering_some_questions_i_have_seen/jt45r5d/) (in reply to ID 156t73t):\nI wonder if Palia will be Steamdeck verified?

The game has a huge focus on social interaction. I use VC pretty often in games like Valorant or Overwatch, and I've met some cool people, even though most of the community for those games is toxic weirdos.

Palia is meant to be discovered and played at your own pace. Palia is not a competitive game and was built around NO FOMO(fear of missing out).

Some folks became ill from overwork.\n\nLeadership had and still has very little diversity, which is painfully noticeable in the type of decisions taken.\n\nTeam structuring creates massive silo-ing and strong \"our team vs. yours\" in terms of output.

This applies to frontline managers all the way up to top leadership. This is despite parading a feedback culture. ICs who provide feedback have the feedback turned around and weaponized against them in performance reviews or elsewhere. The company is packed full of very talented ICs who are deprived of the support they need to succeed, and then blamed and take punishment when things don't go the way leadership wants them to. \r\n\r\n\r\n- Dishonesty and deceit is rampant in communication to employees. Never have I seen such a level of dishonest behavior from leadership, especially at such a small company. I can understand a need to be careful on what information to be transparent with, but the leadership very frequently, intentionally, and blatantly lies to everyone at the company about the state of the company. The sad part is that these lies are very shallow and most people see through them, but they serve their short-sighted purpose of keeping the illusion of the \"everything is fine\" dog. One example is telling everyone there will only be a few weeks of \"targeted overtime, not crunch\", knowing full well that it would last indefinitely for many.\r\n\r\n - Diversity problems explicitly ignored by leadership because it's not a \"priority,\" despite the large human impact of them. The company made big promises around D&amp;I to employees, and has failed to live up to them. And recently things have gotten much worse. \r\n\r\nThere are many other problems I did not list here. I fear that many more good people at the company will be hurt by the reckless course management is taking the company.",

To maturely call out failures in the org and lay out a plan to improve them. To question and test assumptions. And to inspire others to follow direction instead of expecting obedience. Not to be afraid of being questioned and lashing out at those who do so.\r\n\r\nI never received any negative feedback in Lattice (our performance review tool) and never got an annual review in the 3 years I was there, never had a mention of being at risk or an underperformer, no PIP, nothing. Then had a personal disagreement with engineering leadership on topics they know are problematic in the company during a 1:1 and, the very next week, they fired me.\r\nThey also originally hid that it was a firing when they shared with the rest of the company until enough people reached out to me and learned otherwise. Then they edited the Slack message announcing my departure.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, I am not saying leadership failed by firing me. Sometimes firings are the best move (though, I do not personally think that is true in my case, you don't know). I am noting that why it happened, how it happened, and what things occurred and did not occur are all serious concerns for the company going forward. Hopefully something they can address in a timely fashion.",

We also spend exorbitant amounts of time making sure everyone is treated well, is happy, and works on tasks that they enjoy.\r\nThe company has gone through explosive growth in the past year while putting a lot of effort into maintaining that culture. \r\nProduction is stellar. No crunch so far, and lots of effort put well ahead of time to ensure it does not hit in the future.\r\nThe project is tons of fun. Everyone plays the game regularly. Players love it. Feedback is open, frank, and widely shared. Leadership listens. \r\nOne of the very few studios out there that is run by creatives, by folks who play and truly love the type of game we're making. It shows.",

As we scale, know that this will require delegating that responsibility downward, relying on sub-teams to foster their own unique sub-cultures as inspired derivatives of the original Singularity6's culture. \nIn service of diversifying our team, I think we're finally making some steps in the right direction there - ensuring we're actively seeking a diverse candidate pool and now hiring for mid-level roles where previously we were only looking for senior candidates, but we've built quite an uphill battle for ourselves given the team we have now. We can do better here. I truly believe we could be a shining example of how diverse perspectives bring about the most amazing games.",

          "cons": "* As with most startups, we're figuring out how best to organize and collaborate across teams as we scale. While S6 has done a remarkable job, particularly during a pandemic, at staying connected, we struggle with projects that require multiple-team coordination. This challenge is also well known and discussed, making it possible to try to improve things rather than just accepting it as it is. While I enjoy the challenge of helping shape how an organization collaborates, if you're looking for well-defined and stable team responsibilities, S6 may not be right for you. \n* While we talk openly about the challenges of creating a diverse workforce in engineering game dev, we are having a difficult time making progress in this direction. While I believe, given our values and culture of respect, people from underrepresented groups would flourish here, we haven't demonstrated the ability to hire diverse candidates yet. Part of this can be attributed to a very senior staff, which skews both our network and our candidate pool, but we need to do better in this space than we are now. \n* While work-life balance is good, it does require self-discipline to balance your time. This project is really exciting and we have a lot of passionate and engaged people. This enthusiasm is contagious and if you're not experienced at holding yourself accountable to other commitments it can absorb a lot of time. The upside is everyone is aware of this and is thoroughly supportive (like I mentioned above) of your away from work. We're in this for the long run.",

The culture, the work processes, and the game all keep in mind how amazing and difficult it is to be a human. This extends from what it's like to build a game as a developer into what it's like to be a player of our game. \n* We think long term, doing what's important over urgent far more often than even large companies with stable budgets do. Our financial investors in the company make this possible too, keeping our focus on the long-term over short term gains. \n* The work-life balance is good, any extra time I dedicate to work comes from my own passion for the project. I'm actively encouraged by my leaders and peers to take time for family and myself. Taking an afternoon off because you've had a hard week is normalized. We have open PTO as well, which our leaders demonstrate taking time away from work is critical to our long-term success. \n* The game we're building is simply delightful, bringing a much needed warmth and coziness to the industry at a quality bar that makes me intensely proud to support building it.\n* We're building a live service game. We're here to build a relationship with our players that could last a lifetime. For a data practitioner, this means my contributions will be critical to our long term success, connecting developers to the players at-large in ways that can't be achieved with box product launches.",

While I believe, given our values and culture of respect, people from underrepresented groups would flourish here, we haven't demonstrated the ability to hire diverse candidates yet.

This extends from what it's like to build a game as a developer into what it's like to be a player of our game. \n* We think long term, doing what's important over urgent far more often than even large companies with stable budgets do. Our financial investors in the company make this possible too, keeping our focus on the long-term over short term gains. \n* The work-life balance is good, any extra time I dedicate to work comes from my own passion for the project. I'm actively encouraged by my leaders and peers to take time for family and myself. Taking an afternoon off because you've had a hard week is normalized. We have open PTO as well, which our leaders demonstrate taking time away from work is critical to our long-term success. \n* The game we're building is simply delightful, bringing a much needed warmth and coziness to the industry at a quality bar that makes me intensely proud to support building it.\n* We're building a live service game.

The sad part is that these lies are very shallow and most people see through them, but they serve their short-sighted purpose of keeping the illusion of the \"everything is fine\" dog. One example is telling everyone there will only be a few weeks of \"targeted overtime, not crunch\", knowing full well that it would last indefinitely for many.\r\n\r\n - Diversity problems explicitly ignored by leadership because it's not a \"priority,\" despite the large human impact of them.

      "# [The Software Architecture of Palia](https://www.singularity6.com/news/software-architecture-of-palia)\nSingularity6’s debut game, Palia, is a free-to-play cozy online multiplayer community simulator. A place where players can play alone or with their friends to experience a beautiful and welcoming world which can be explored and personalized.\n\nSocial interaction and a persistent shared world are key features of the game. But these elements are also some of the most challenging to implement, scale, distribute geographically, and operate at minimal operational cost and negative player impact.\n\nPlayers experience the art and soul that our development team has poured into the game, but the infrastructure that makes it all possible behind the scenes is hidden from view. We are proud of what our team has accomplished with Palia, and we want to spotlight the studio’s hard work, including what players don’t experience directly. We also want to share some important lessons learned during our journey; we hope that sharing the lessons learned while developing Palia can be useful to others facing similar challenges.\n\nNow follow us behind the scenes of our Palia development journey!\n\nGame Engine\n\nBuilding an online multiplayer title from scratch benefits from a robust and proven game engine. We made the choice to build Palia using Unreal Engine. Unreal gives us powerful tools to build with out of the box, such as a strong networking and replication library to build social features, a graphics pipeline to build a beautiful world, a powerful physics engine that can simulate complex environments, and so much more. We use Unreal Engine for our game servers as well as our client, which gives players a real-time interactive environment.\n\nEach instance of the game server currently hosts up to 25 players, and we split up each server by what we call a map. These can be permanent fixtures, including our central hub Kilima Village, or even temporary available experiences, such as our Maji Market, which was only available for one month during our Luna New Year in-game event. When players travel between maps in Palia, the game client disconnects from one server and connects to a new one. We will share more details on how this works in our matchmaking service deep dive section.\n\nThis synergistic model is crucial for our team: we can develop most of the logic for Palia inside the engine and deploy to both clients and servers. This allows anyone on the team to test both the game and the game server in editor mode, which has been critical for our development velocity.\n\nSpotlight: memory leakage\n\nUnreal Engine servers are commonly used in “session-based games,” such as Fortnite: games that start and end within a certain amount of time. Memory leakage is not a big concern for session-based games because a new server is spun up for a new match and destroyed when the match ends. Any leaked memory will be cleaned before the next batch of players begin playing.\n\nPalia is a persistent shared-world game and the lifespan of our game servers is variable depending on how players move through the game world. A single game server may remain online and serve players for an entire patch cycle which could be weeks. Memory leakage which is cleaned up regularly for a session-based game can grow and compound, and small leaks might end up consuming two or even four times the amount of Random Access Memory (RAM) proportionally affecting our operational costs.\n\nTo combat this issue, we invested in solutions to help us identify memory leaks, and we spent useful time designing nudges for players to travel between maps as to increase the likelihood that a server would empty out and be shut down.\n\nUnexpectedly and fortunately, increasing geographical distribution helped with this problem: hosting servers near players not only helps with latency (because it reduces the distance that signals need to travel); but also with rotating empty servers because players tend to play at the same times, making it rare that somebody in that region is playing in the middle of the night and increasing the probability of servers to become empty, shut down, and cleaned.\n\nThis screenshot from one of our monitoring dashboards shows the memory usage of a portion of our game servers over a24h period in Feb 2024. The trend of linear memory increase is clearly visible.\n\nServices\n\nThe game client and servers talk to our services for specific actions, such as logging players into the game, loading characters, saving progress, sending chat messages to other players, making purchased outfits are stored in the player’s closet and many more.\n\nWe loosely follow a “microservice” posture, in which we prefer to host many different services specialized on one player feature.\n\nWe use HTTP as the North/South protocol (in and out of the datacenter) while we use gRPC for East/West communication (for services talking to each other inside the datacenter).\n\nWe use Rust exclusively as the programming language for our services and we try to include both integration and load testing as part of the definition of “done” for key services, including matchmaking, player presence and player state persistence which represent the largest percentage of our request load.\n\nOur unit and integration tests are also written in Rust, but we use Locust to support and execute our load tests. Locust load tests are written in Python which is simpler to program. The ability to quickly write and modify load tests was beneficial to us and sped up adoption.\n\nSpotlight: Rust for Microservices\n\nRust is a beloved programming language by many systems programmers because it provides state-of-the-art protection against common software vulnerabilities (buffer overflows and race conditions, for example) without introducing any performance penalties.\n\nRust is also a modern programming language. It is surrounded by a diverse and vibrant community of contributors and a wide range of libraries and tools. Documentation is excellent (especially onboarding tutorials) and the compiler is surely one of the most helpful and user-friendly.\n\nOf course, no programming language is perfect. Rust's posture is heavily focused on correctness, which is generally beneficial, but comes with a significant upfront cost which is visible in our development velocity. Rust makes it very hard to “cut corners” and punt hardening for later. It is a very good quality when something that was supposed to be just a prototype becomes load bearing in production by sheer pressure of business needs, but it makes it hard to move quickly and with agility around shifting requirements (which is a constant in startups and game development).\n\nThe other issue was hiring and onboarding. Rust’s relative youth as a programming language makes it somewhat difficult to hire people that have production experience with the language. Although the language is very popular, few people have used Rust in a professional team setting. Most people who have Rust experience have only used it for personal projects. With this in mind, onboarding took much longer than we expected. We factored 90 days to get engineers up to speed, but it turned out to take at least 6 months for most of the team to get comfortable and confident with the language.\n\nWe are very happy with the performance, latency, scalability, robustness and security of our Rust services. But there are moments when we wonder how much opportunity cost was spent in forcing up-front solidity of every piece of this layer.\n\nWe consider it an advantage for the studio to have managed to amortize those onboarding costs and the maintenance costs of our services is indeed very low, but those thinking of following our footsteps down the Rust path, should be willing to allocate a significant effort to education and onboarding. These costs will likely reduce over time as Rust becomes more popular in production settings, but it’s unclear what that rate will be.\n\nSeveral of our services are interesting and sophisticated enough to merit more attention: player state management and matchmaking.\n\nPlayer State Management\n\nWe consider player state all the information that a game server needs to recreate the most recent game world experienced by the player. The architecture of our game is server-authoritative which means that game servers decide the state of the world and act as referees when game clients report inconsistent data (for example, because of time delay in transmission). We took this route because Palia is a social game so a player cheating or modifying their state could have a negative impact on the experience of other players. The risk of cheating is reduced when it's our system that ultimately controls player state.\n\nThe simplest way to persist state is to wait until a player exits a game server and have the server send this information to the database. Unfortunately, this makes state changes in that server vulnerable to the server itself crashing and losing that data (which is only kept in volatile memory for performance reasons). Instead, several times a second we check for player state changes, and if there are any, that data is immediately queued and sent to the database to be persisted.\n\nSpotlight: data first vs. schema first\n\nA source of contention around player state is the modeling lifecycle: who and what decides what is valid to be stored into such a state? Traditional data-modeling techniques suggest a “schema first” approach: the structure of the data (the schema) is created ahead of time and then only data that conforms to that structure can be saved into the database.\n\nThis has the advantage that the database validates the shape of the data. The disadvantage is that one has to know ahead of time the structure of the data needed… which can be challenging to coordinate across different teams.\n\nTo increase the ease with which game engineers and technical designers could work, we decided on a different model in which the structure of the data would be decided in C++ structs directly within Unreal and then marshaled and persisted in the database as a binary blob (using the Flexbuffer format). The schema is the struct declaration itself and we use Unreal’s runtime type reflection system to export the schema to our database.\n\nThe advantage of this architectural choice is that it enabled game engineers to develop features that required state persistence without the need for constant coordination. The downside is that the data is opaque to the database, which is more expensive to keep uniform and consolidated. This has required us to invest in additional tooling around the player state management system to validate, backup, modify and correct player state when it diverges from the expected structure.\n\nDespite the additional layer of development investment needed to provide hardening on top of what the database normally provides, we believe this architecture has significantly cut down the time required to deliver new features with data persistence, such as our most recent Luna New Year event.\n\nMatchmaking\n\nIn many competitive-style online games, matchmaking is the process of selecting people for a match. For Palia, matchmaking means matching the player with the game server that we believe will give players the best gameplay experience.\n\nThere are several dimensions that we take into consideration during matching:\n\nLocation - how far away the game server is from where the player is currently playing (because closer server means lower latency and lower latency means a more fluid and immersive experience)\n\nFriends - how many of the player’s friends are currently playing on that server (because the more people they know the more meaningful their interaction will be)\n\nPopulation - how many people are playing on that server (because the more people are playing the more alive the world feels)\n\nThe matchmaking system is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing us to add more signals to the matching algorithm over time if we desire.\n\nAnother crucial feature of the matchmaking system is the ability to distinguish “join” requests and “travel” requests. A join request happens when a player starts the game and wants to join. A travel request is a match required by a player leaving one map of the game and traveling to another.\n\nThe ability to distinguish the two allows us to offer priority to “travel” requests when the system is under load and there is high contention. This is because it’s far less disruptive for players to wait a few minutes to join and then wait only a few seconds to travel between maps, than one in which the delays are spread uniformly across all matching requests.\n\nThis screenshot shows a piece of the dashboard we use to monitor queue sizes and the distribution of times it takes for a matchmaking request (join or travel) to be satisfied.\n\nSpotlight: game-aware internal queueing and autoscaling\n\nEvery empty server running in the cloud without a player on it is a waste of money. On the other hand, there might be players who want to play and all of the game servers have their allocated slots filled so they would benefit from an empty server to land in.\n\nMany online games design “login queues” or similar ways to restrict the inbound flow of players and scale up or down the number of servers to meet the demand. Originally, this was our intent as well, but we realized we would benefit from a more sophisticated matchmaking design that could distinguish between joining and traveling. We also realized that the matchmaker had all the information it needed to control the size of the game server fleet.\n\nThis is how we came up with the Admiral: a component of the matchmaking system that oversees the fleet of game servers. The Admiral understands when the current fleet of game servers is insufficient to satisfy the number of players requesting a match and is able to ask the underlying cloud system (specifically Agones) to request the creation of more game server instances. Agones, on the other hand, is responsible for shutting down game servers that have been empty for some time.\n\nThe integration of autoscaling with matchmaking and the separation of concerns between the Admiral (scaling up) and Agones (scaling down) has served us very well and has managed to provide us with shock absorption to the game when things didn’t go as planned. Several times, the elasticity of these queues between maps have saved the team from having to bring down the game entirely to fix issues during misaligned deployments or unforeseen behaviors during load spikes.\n\nThis screenshot shows the view of the game servers fleet from the Admiral. Each line is really two lines: one for the “desired size” and another for the “actual size”. This information is used to tell the cloud orchestrator to spin up more game servers for a particular map type as they are needed by players being matched to servers that don’t yet exist.\n\nData Management\n\nOur architecture of loosely coupled software components wouldn’t be very useful without data flowing between them and being persisted, validated, or aggregated.\n\nDatabases\n\nOne of the most difficult elements of creating a shared perpetual world is constructing the ability for players to influence it (and one another) in a context that feels immediate and consistent. A key factor to provide a positive player experience is the choice of the database architecture.\n\nWe decided to use ScyllaDB as our main data persistence layer. ScyllaDB is a C++ rewrite of Apache Cassandra (originally created at Facebook and, in turn, heavily influenced by Google BigTable and Amazon DynamoDB), a distributed column store.\n\nThe biggest advantage of ScyllaDB for us has been its elastic scalability and its cloud native “design for failure” posture that aligned very well with ours. One significant advantage of ScyllaDB for us is the ability to attach replication strategy to a table but eventual consistency levels to a query. This gives us a lot of flexibility because in some cases we need consistency more than we need speed and we can tune that directly at the query level. This is not possible with traditional relational databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL.\n\nThis functionality is crucial, for example, when dealing with a persistent player state: we want the data to be replicated on multiple computers before we return a response to the game server. This means that both the game server and multiple database nodes have to die (at the very same time!) for that player state update to get lost. As far as we can tell, this has never happened.\n\nWe also use PostgreSQL (hosted for us by AWS) for the catalog of our outfits available for purchase in the game. We used a relational database here because we felt it was better suited for this particular job.\n\nAsynchronous Messaging\n\nAnother important part of the data management layer is the ability of software components to message one another asynchronously.\n\nWe have two of such busses:\n\nThe first for aggregates and collects telemetry for player behavior (which uses Apache Kafka, more on this later) and feeds our analytics and machine learning pipelines.\n\nAnother coordinates software components (for example, the control plane between the fleet auto-scaler and the game servers). This uses EMQX as the broker and MQTT as the protocol.\n\nWhy two? Mostly because they serve different purposes, have different strengths and weaknesses, and are managed by different teams focusing on separate outcomes. There might be value in consolidating things further in the future, but for now this separation is serving us well.\n\nSpotlight: MQTT and Apache ActiveMQ v5 (aka Artemis)\n\nThe use of MQTT as the message bus protocol for our game servers control planes was decided precisely to isolate us from lock-in of a particular broker implementation. In retrospect, this was a weak choice: MQTT is an IoT protocol and we were attracted by the fact that it was designed for devices with small power and low bandwidth. We wanted a solution that would be easy and cheap for the game servers to interact with and didn’t consume a lot of their resources.\n\nUnfortunately, many MQTT brokers simply implemented that protocol on top of their existing native systems. We picked Apache ActiveMQ v5 (aka Artemis) because it was established and it supported v5 of the MQTT protocol (which offered features we needed) but was written and designed before clouds existed and turned out to be incompatible with our preferred “loosely coupled components expected to fail” architectural posture.\n\nArtemis has been the source of much apprehension and tribulation. We ended up having to patch the software to fit our needs. We operated with a forked version in production just to keep it from falling over regularly (the MQTT layer and cross-regional federation layers did not work well together).\n\nWe have since migrated to EMQX which is a more modern MQTT broker, designed from the ground-up with MQTT in mind and we have not looked back.\n\nThe lesson learned here is that even established and battle-tested software might still end up performing poorly when utilized in a different context and with different operational constraints than was originally intended.\n\nData Pipelines\n\nAnother important principle of our software architecture is that we want to be able to observe and monitor how the system is behaving so that we can act on it effectively when behavior deviates from the norm.\n\nWe treat data differently based on whether the decision making that it supports is latency sensitive or not. In fact, we use completely different systems for low-latency decision support (seconds to minutes) vs. high-latency (days or weeks).\n\nSpotlight: player behavior vs. system behavior\n\nIn the past, we separated data based on whether it was about player behavior or software behavior. But we quickly realized that distinction was not very helpful in practice.\n\nFor example, a purchasing event from a player is technically a player behavior and insights gathered from them influence strategic decision making with high-latency (days or weeks). But such a high-latency reaction would be detrimental to both our players and our revenue if we didn’t get notified immediately if the frequency of purchases dropped outside of the normal range of operation.\n\nIt is generally true that data generated from the behavior of players influences decision making in aggregate and with high latency while events generated by the behavior of software systems influences decisions and actions that require quick reaction times. But our ability to route data based on decision making latency needs and not on the semantics of origin has made it easier to reason about data routing decisions, especially when the two pipelines are handled by different teams with different skills, strengths, and goals.\n\nObservability\n\nWe picked Prometheus as the time-series database powering the low-latency data pipeline and alerting. The key advantage here is the “pull” model in which it is Prometheus to “scrape” data from our software components, which makes it a lot simpler to maintain.\n\nWe also use Grafana as our visual dashboarding system querying the data stored in Prometheus along with Loki and Tempo to deal textual logs and tracing the flow of execution across several of our software components.\n\nLastly, we use Sloth to automate the generation of SLOs.\n\nAnalytics\n\nThe high-latency data pipeline revolves around Apache Kafka (managed for us by Confluent) which captures and routes the data as well as Apache Spark (managed for us by Databricks), which we use to aggregate and analyze the data.\n\nWe use Apache Airflow (managed for us by Astronomer) for monitoring and scheduling long-running workflows for data aggregation and analysis. Lastly, we use Tableau to power the visualization of the insights that result from our data analysis.\n\nCloud Infrastructure\n\nAnother development challenge is the “free-to-play” nature of our distribution strategy. This approach made it difficult to predict the amount of players that would play the game, especially around key events, such as platform launches, major updates, and in-game events.\n\nWe decided to be “cloud native” from the start because “elasticity” in supply of computation and bandwidth is a key advantage that cloud providers have over acquiring and maintaining our own server infrastructure; especially for gaming startups (for which capital is constrained) and when deploying across multiple geographical regions.\n\nCloud native for us didn’t simply mean: “run our programs on somebody else’s computer.” Cloud native for us meant designing a software architecture composed of small pieces that are loosely coupled and always expected to fail.\n\nWe call this “designing for failure.” Of course, we never want our systems to fail. However, we believe that resiliency in software systems comes less from preventing failure, and more from providing mitigations to such risks and the ability to restore service as quickly and automatically as possible. We want to design to reduce failure but we always expect it to happen, so when it does happen, our systems would not be surprised by it.\n\nKey components of this strategy were using Kubernetes as our orchestration system, Linkerd as our service mesh, Traefik as our load balancer and Agones to manage our fleet of game servers. We also rely heavily on the “infrastructure as code” principle, using Kustomize to help us keep our configurations DRY and ArgoCD to power continuous deployments.\n\nKubecost helps us measure costs, and we recently swapped from cluster-autoscaler to Karpenter to optimize cluster elasticity and to help pick the best server instances. This change allowed us to save a non-trivial percentage of our cloud costs by automating the selection of instance types to use to run our workloads.\n\nFor provisioning infrastructure we rely on Terraform and Spacelift. We rely on Vault to store secrets without our cloud environments. We also conduct chaos testing using Litmus.\n\nAnd we rely on a few different services for authentication and authorization systems, including FusionAuth for account management, Zendesk for customer support management, Stripe for payment processing, and Vivox for our in-game chat system.\n\nOur only cloud provider is Amazon Web Services which provides us computers, storage, and bandwidth across multiple regions: United States, Germany, and Japan. We also rely on Cloudflare for geo-aware DNS and load balancing as well as DDoS protection.\n\nSpotlight: Nomad vs. Kubernetes\n\nWe had originally chosen Nomad as our orchestration solution, mostly because it was perceived to be conceptually simpler and it was much more compatible with Windows workloads (which we thought we might need for testing purposes).\n\nUnfortunately, Nomad had one very significant problem: the momentum of the development community around it was significantly smaller than around Kubernetes. This had two significant issues for us: a) we had to develop in-house solutions that the community around Kubernetes had already implemented; and b) it was harder to engage the team with a technology that many considered an evolutionary dead-end.\n\nWe made the difficult call to switch our cloud orchestration system by using the argument that our development velocity would significantly improve and our operational risks would be reduced. This turned out to be very much the case and it’s a decision we would happily make again.\n\nBuild Systems\n\nThere are two primary concepts used in the building of Palia and its supporting services: the build platform and the build system. Historically, game studios lumped these two together around the primary continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) component. We borrowed some plays from large-scale build and release systems beyond gaming: using a heavily distributed approach inspired by some of our team members’ experiences in other industries, such as banking.\n\nTo power the build system we use Jenkins, but take care to draw a distinction between the software, and the underlying infrastructure upon which it runs and integrates. While related, these things are best served by intentional, separate configuration management and Infrastructure as Code practices which can quickly become unwieldy and complex if attempting to do so under a monolithic design. The result is a hybrid cloud approach to the build system. We use both an on-prem data center and Amazon Web Services, and one side of the architecture can be maintained without potentially negatively impacting the other.\n\nWe also took the time to redesign the initial version of the build system (Jenkins pipelines) around Unreal Engine’s native tooling, namely, BuildGraph. Doing so required a lot of work up-front as the old method was cobbled together between Jenkins Pipelines and Python scripts, but the declarative nature of BuildGraph tooling has allowed us to increase correctness, reduce build system maintenance, and increase flexibility such that we can build almost every target platform with minimal specific changes for each. A key component of this success was integrating with AutoSDK and creating a “standard library” of sorts in Jenkins to glue it all together.\n\nIn our latest version of the build platform we are able to mostly dynamically scale the number of executors based on demand. The build system can then simply act as a “glue layer” to distribute requested tasks among the available executors as parallel pipeline runs. Further, we’ve incorporated designing for Self-Service by other teams, such that they can “pick and choose” which artifacts they want built via a single interface. We call this the “Prime Pipeline,” which presents a series of configurable parameters and then schedules the running of “Sub-Pipelines” to do the work, passing those parameters as appropriate. This means that via the same Prime Pipeline interface, one Engineer could choose to build only one Platform Client from the library of Clients available, and one Server, getting only those two artifacts; or they could select everything and end up with every Client and Server we currently offer as targets.\n\nSpotlight: Capacity Management in a Hybrid Cloud World\n\nA trade-off we make for this level of granularity and distribution is the initial difficulty in managing capacity. We use several build executors of different types and had to really break-down our pipelines and how each stage would be distributed to the executors both on-prem and in AWS. Then we had to measure a single run of each pipeline to get more accurate numbers to use for calculating instance sizes, costs, expected load, and timings for stage and whole pipeline execution. This cost us a lot of time up-front, and while we are glad we did it, it is yet another piece of operational overhead which must be monitored, reviewed, and adjusted in order to remain reasonably accurate. Changing something as simple as the Node Label of a particular pipeline Stage can have serious impacts to all of the metrics we measure, most notably, build times. Unfortunately, there aren't a whole lot of “drop-in” or “off-the-shelf” solutions for these types of systems, so we have had to track these things manually, and then automate as we go to attempt to reduce the operational burden.\n\nFurthermore, managing two different sets of infrastructure is not for the faint of heart, or those unfamiliar with Hybrid Cloud management. While the patterns may be very similar, the implementation proved to be a lot more work than we anticipated.\n\nFor example, AWS and other cloud service providers make APIs available to interact on a very granular level with their exposed components. On the other end of the spectrum, even the most mature on-prem infrastructure providers rely on their own custom tooling for managing hardware components. This is why projects such as Ansible are in such heavy use in the IT industry, and S6 is no exception here as we prioritize the use of open source tools where possible to ease cognitive load and keep costs low.\n\nThe challenge that made this most difficult was the disparity in experience using this approach on our team members’ time. Some of us come from more of a Platforming background, others from a Tooling background, and still others from primarily a Jenkins Pipeline writing background. This is great for general cross-functionality within the team, but requires careful planning to execute well even among the highest-performing teams.\n\nVersion Control\n\nWe use two different version control systems to manage the development lifecycle of our code: Perforce for the game code, and git (hosted in Bitbucket) for everything else.\n\nUsing different version control systems is clearly suboptimal and not a decision we took lightly: git is generally preferred by backend engineers and is far better supported by modern development environments.\n\nUnfortunately, Perforce is very well integrated in Unreal Engine because that’s what Epic Games uses (the makers of Unreal Engine). Also, git isn’t really designed to work with very large binary files, and a lot of our in-game assets and original sources are giant binary files. Perforce works well in these situations.\n\nEarly on, we tried using git-lfs (large file storage), which is supposed to help with this problem but we gave up when we realized how much effort it would be to retrofit all of the Epic development tools (UnrealGameSync, for example) to work with git.\n\nWe sincerely wish we had a single consolidated version control system and code review workflow, but it is not a trivial exercise.\n\nSpotlight: Consolidated Repos\n\nOne of the issues we faced with git was that it was too easy and convenient to create new repositories, causing a proliferation of them. The biggest issue we faced was the inability to make changes that cross-cut different services at once. This created a lot of production overhead and reduced our ability to consolidate the behavior of services.\n\nWe considered switching to a full “monorepo” but many of us were unfamiliar with it and feared additional complexity and overhead that we had no additional development capacity to support.\n\nThe compromise we reached was a handful of consolidated repos in which many individual git repositories were merged into a single repository and then archived. All the microservices ended up in this single repository, but they could be developed, built, tested and deployed in isolation. This made it much easier to modify code across services (such as version dependencies) as well as simplifying the creation of libraries. This approach facilitated an incremental externalization of common functionality into modules that could be more easily reused across services, reducing copy/paste code duplication and reducing our maintenance costs.\n\nSaaS-y Open Source\n\nOne common theme you might have noticed in our architecture is that we prefer to depend on software that is open source and that we could host ourselves if we wanted/needed to. We also prefer to rely on a SaaS vendor that provides and manages this software for us instead of running it ourselves.\n\nThis offers us several advantages:\n\nWe are not locked into a particular cloud or vendor provider (as we could run the system ourselves if we needed to).\n\nWe can provision systems more quickly (our people don’t need to learn the intricacies of configuring them).\n\nLeverage vendor expertise to fix issues and/or edge cases when we encounter them.\n\nKeeps the vendor prices under control under our threat of shutting down our vendor contract and hosting the system ourselves.\n\nWe deviated from this posture only rarely and when there was no open source alternative that made sense for our business needs. However, we do believe this paradigm worked well for us and provides a way to fund and support further development of these open source projects. This, in turn, lowers our future risks by helping make the development of these open projects more sustainable (as these hosting vendors often employ contributors to the open source projects and continue to fund their contributions for mutually symbiotic benefit).\n\nConclusions\n\nIt’s rare to get access to the source code that makes up video games, so it’s rare to have the opportunity to learn directly from it. Even rarer is a view into the decisions and tradeoffs, the lessons learned, the paths not taken and those taken but with later regret.\n\nWe hope that this deep-dive on the challenges and successes of creating Palia’s software architecture provides some insight and inspiration for others facing similar challenges.\n\nIf you have any questions about Palia’s software architecture and development, or simply if you want to start a conversation feel free to reach out to us at hello@singularity6.com.\n\nSpecial Thanks\n\nThe list of people that contributed to this architecture is very long (see the Palia credits for the full list) and we wouldn’t do it justice to replicate it here.

      "# [Palia studio Singularity 6 is the latest studio to suffer layoffs by Mollie Taylor on 2024-04-05](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/mmo/palia-studio-singularity-6-is-the-latest-studio-to-suffer-layoffs/)\nSingularity 6, the studio behind the cosy MMO Palia, is the latest developer to suffer layoffs. Just under 50 developers, around one third of the company, have been let go according to Polygon reporter Nicole Carpenter.\n\nEnvironmental artist Daphne Fiato tweeted \"Whelp, I've been laid off,\" following up with \"49 people Thanos snapped\". Other Singularity 6 folk joined to reveal they'd also been laid off, including Brian Ernst who tweeted they'd been with the developer for five years. One developer revealed via LinkedIn that they'd been given the news while on vacation, according to MMORPG.com.\n\nSingularity 6 is yet to publicly address the layoffs, with its last Twitter post happening on April 3, one day before they occurred. It's the same situation for the official Palia account.\n\nPalia only just arrived on Steam on March 25, following a stint as an Epic exclusive. The free-to-play MMO has generated some praise for its cosy vibes and its stress-free cycle of farming and building, but it's also been criticised for its slow progression, reliance on timers and limited multiplayer elements. Its development status has also led to some confusion—it's not in early access, and the store page implies a feature-complete game, when in reality it is still in beta. On Steam, it's currently sitting at just over 3,700 user reviews with a \"Mixed\" rating.\n\nThe studio joins a painfully long line of developers to have nixed a portion of its staff this year. Despite only being four months into the year, the number of layoffs are close to reaching last year's count. It was estimated that around 10,500 developers lost their jobs last year, according to the Game Industry Layoffs tracker. The number is already up to around 8000 estimated job losses right now, with more undoubtedly on their way given the volatility of the industry.",

      "# [How Singularity 6’s ‘Palia’ Conquered Cross-Regional Gaming with Amazon EKS and Karpenter on 2024-05-07](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/gametech/how-singularity-6s-palia-conquered-cross-regional-gaming-with-amazon-eks-and-karpenter/)\nIntroduction\n\nDeveloping an online multiplayer game capable of supporting thousands of concurrent players is an incredibly complex endeavor. For Singularity 6 (S6), creators of the hit game “Palia,” which released across platforms in 2023 and 2024—their developers needed to craft an immersive and captivating gaming experience while managing the vast resources and infrastructure required to keep the game’s services running smoothly.\n\nThroughout the development process, unforeseen obstacles and hurdles arose, testing the team’s resilience and problem-solving abilities. Furthermore, launching globally across console and PC platforms introduced an additional layer of intricacy, requiring planning and execution to ensure a seamless experience for players worldwide. To boost their small infrastructure team, S6 leveraged Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) and Karpenter’s flexibility and elasticity while minimizing cost—allowing Palia to reach over 3 million players in six months, in three different Regions, and across four distribution platforms.\n\nThis article describes the process the team at Singularity 6 used to make the Palia launch smooth and successful.\n\nOverview of Palia’s AWS infrastructure\n\nEarly on, Singularity 6 made the decision to host Palia on Amazon Web Services (AWS). As an online multiplayer game, the team understood that Palia needed a “cloud-first” approach. Today, Palia runs using Amazon EKS in three AWS Regions: US West (Oregon) – us-west-2, Asia Pacific (Tokyo) – ap-northeast-1, Europe (Frankfurt) – eu-central-1.\n\nPalia’s backend services run inside an EKS cluster, including the game servers powered by Unreal Engine. For persisting player state across a shared world, Palia relies on ScyllaDB as the database layer. ScyllaDB is highly scalable and designed from the start to be distributed and fast, trading speed for eventual consistency. Palia’s external traffic is routed through a geo-load balanced domain name system (DNS) address to a Network Load Balancer (NLB).\n\nReleasing Palia\n\nDuring Palia’s development, its cloud infrastructure was built entirely in a single datacenter: US West (Oregon). Singularity 6 knew that the studio would eventually need to release Palia in other Regions to reduce latency and improve the player experience. Load testing their system was also necessary to ensure a smooth rollout. Still, there was fear that there were not enough players in alpha tests to accurately simulate launch numbers.\n\nThe team used this opportunity to clone part of their production cloud infrastructure to Frankfurt. As the launch window approached, Palia released in the US first, while leveraging Frankfurt as their load and stress testing cluster, then ran a ScyllaDB copy to evaluate the latency of their queries across Regions on different continents. This “dark multiregional rollout” at the start greatly reduced risks when the game began operating in a multi-regional setting later as the S6 team could gather information on real player behavior.\n\nLoad testing\n\nBefore Palia had any players, Singularity 6 simulated them by writing load tests against their microservices using Locust. Their major focus was stress testing critical backend components, particularly ones that rely on other services to function. To generate sufficient load, S6 wrote a Locust test, ran it from within the Amazon EKS cluster, and then scaled it rapidly and effectively while gathering data that showed how the test systems responded. Using this method, the team identified inefficient code paths, balanced resource requests and limits, and tweaked auto scaling metrics.\n\nChaos testing with Litmus\n\nAfter Singularity 6 saw how their services responded to large volumes of requests, the team decided to inject some chaos into their tests. Their goal was to conduct experiments and observe how the rest of the system responded – especially for critical systems where an outage might cause a cascading failure. Using Litmus, S6 injected latency, created network isolation, and caused outages for specific services. Along the way, S6 constantly asked themselves, “Can we still play Palia?” Chaos testing helped build confidence because the team learned that once players were in-game, many types of chaos had little to no effect on them.\n\nRelease\n\nAhead of launch, Palia’s developers added and tested infrastructure to ensure they could match their player’s demands. Even with all their prep work, S6 encountered rough edges amid successes during their launch.\n\nIssue: Poor VPC planning\n\nWhen Singularity 6 started using Amazon EKS, the team already had a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) module written in Terraform. The module was not perfect, but S6 decided it was good enough to move forward without major changes. However, the team realized that this was the wrong decision within hours of launching Palia when an alert on pending pods revealed that the game had run out of IP addresses in its VPC’s subnets. S6 knew they could add additional subnets to the VPC, but didn’t notice any lines of code that might eventually cause issues in the EKS Terraform module.\n\nThe issue was they were concatenating all their private subnet IDs and public subnet IDs to the EKS cluster’s subnet IDs. When the team added new subnets to the VPC, they were also expanding the EKS cluster control plane onto these subnets. This caused issues when the cluster needed to upgrade or when a managed node group needed to roll its instances.\n\nIn summary, an initial lack of VPC planning led to a proliferation of many unique managed node groups in Singularity 6’s environment. This made it harder to make changes to the EKS cluster as the node groups changed. Below, Singularity 6 discusses how using Karpenter helped reduce their usage of managed node groups, which helped to solve this issue.\n\nSuccess: Templated resource requests and limits\n\nDuring the early ramp up, the team encountered an incident where a component of their Linkerd stack was impacted from running out of memory (OOM). Despite having multiple replicas of this component, they saw other side effects of the OOMKill pod shutdowns, which meant they needed to act quickly. Within a few minutes, the team identified the component being killed and they were able to patch the resource requests to higher limits.\n\nLuckily, S6 had accounted for this issue by adding templating in their Helm and Kustomize to account for setting resource requests and limits. An extra few hours of development work proved instrumental for patching the system while it was scaling and allowing for a smooth experience for their players.\n\nPost release: Adding new Regions\n\nAfter Palia’s release in US West (Oregon), the team finished their infrastructure in Frankfurt and started work to expand further in Tokyo. This was in preparation for Palia’s Nintendo Switch launch, which would bring in substantial new players from Asia. The team knew that providing game servers and services closer to their players would be instrumental to the game’s success, so getting Asia Pacific (Tokyo) online was a natural next step.\n\nIssue: Lack of instance diversity\n\nPalia’s backend, particularly the game servers, requires either a “many nodes with fewer vCPUs” or “fewer nodes with more vCPU” approach. In the Asia Pacific (Tokyo) Region, the team found that their preferred instance types had limited availability than either Oregon or Frankfurt. To solve for this, they decided to explore the use of Karpenter.\n\nSuccess: Using Kustomize for DRY configuration\n\nAdding new Regions revealed an obvious issue in their Gitops-style setup of ArgoCD. Namely, keeping their config (microservice version numbers, chart versions, resource requests and limits) in sync across multiple clusters.\n\nTo solve this, the team turned to Kustomize to further “customize” their DRY configurations and centralize changes such as bumping version numbers. Kustomize allowed S6 to define a single file that contained the version of both the game server and microservices. ArgoCD has excelled at noticing git repo changes and deploying updates to all regions.\n\nUsing Karpenter\n\nAt the end of October 2023, Karpenter moved to a beta readiness. At the time, Singularity 6 was using the cluster-autoscaler and formed several hypotheses that using Karpenter to manage their EKS instances closer to the control plane would provide several benefits, including:\n\nIt removed almost all of the managed node groups by reducing the burden of updating them as the cluster changed.\n\nIt granted the ability to quickly test additional instance configurations such as family, size, and architecture.\n\nIt allowed flexibility to easily adapt to Regions that lack a particular instance type.\n\nIt provided a more nuanced view of the cluster to start instances just-in-time and reduce their idle CPU.\n\nSuccess: Flexibility, experimentation, and idle costs\n\nInitially, Singularity 6 hypothesized that using Karpenter would give them flexibility across instance types, sizes, and even CPU architecture. For example, the team thought it would be straightforward to experiment running Palia on Graviton instances (with ARM processors) without any Terraform changes to managed node groups. Karpenter also streamlined issues with instance constraints in a Region like Tokyo. Finally, by configuring Karpenter to use varied instance sizes and families, S6 was able to run a cluster without any of the overhead of multiple Terraform-defined managed node groups.\n\nUsing Karpenter with its NodePool resource resulted in a reduction of idle game servers in their clusters. By configuring a more diverse set of instances, Singularity 6 was able to decrease idle cost by 75%.\n\nSuccess: Karpenter accelerates Kubernetes upgrades\n\nSwitching to Karpenter removed the need for almost all of their managed node groups. They no longer had an EKS cluster with hundreds of instances across several managed node groups. This simplification, as well as using control_plane_subnet_ids, allowed the team to more easily upgrade their EKS clusters to newer versions of Kubernetes. With fewer instances to launch and less “node group overhead” in their Terraform module, S6 was able to upgrade from K8s v1.26 to v1.28 across six EKS clusters in a few hours.\n\nConclusion\n\nFrom the player’s perspective, Palia’s PC launch went smoothly. The team performed load testing and chaos testing, which ensured the systems scaled properly. The elasticity of AWS offerings proved invaluable for this as they were able to double server capacity from 25 to 50 EC2 instances within hours across multiple Regions. Despite Singularity 6’s best efforts, they still ran into issues due to design choices made very early on.\n\nFollowing Palia’s PC release, Singularity 6’s choice to focus on improving Terraform, Kustomize, and Karpenter, allowed them to rapidly add new Regions to the game and to improve their launch on Nintendo Switch. Again, AWS availability in multiple Regions allowed the team to move from a single Region to a world-wide infrastructure in a matter of months. Moreover, by moving configuration out of Terraform and EKS and into Karpenter, they were able to adapt to resource constraints and more quickly conduct experiments.\n\nIf you are curious about more details about the Palia software architecture, head over to the Singularity 6 blog for a more in-depth overview of this topic.\n\nA special thank you to the Singularity 6 team who contributed to this architecture and blog post: Emily Price, Kyle Allan, Marc Tamsky, Matthew Walter, George Lin, Alec Nunn, Maciej Ciezki, Brian Tomlinson, and Stefano Mazzocchi.",

      "# [Palia’s black market card game is causing player arguments by Cass Marshall on 2024-07-25](https://www.polygon.com/24206154/palia-hot-pot-card-game-arguments)\nLately, there’s been a strangely hostile underbelly in super cozy life sim Palia — and I’m not talking about the hidden cartel gambling pit under the inn. Developer Singularity 6 recently added a cute and simple card game for players to enjoy, called Hot Pot. What should have been another fun diversion in the Stardew Valley-style game has instead revealed a split in the player base.\n\nPalia takes place in the cozy Kilima Village, where players can hang out with the townsfolk, farm, cook, or head out and explore the nearby bustling Bahari Bay. At night, an underground market opens up under the town store. The shopkeep, a cheerful cat-man smuggler, runs the night market from 6 p.m. to 3 a.m.\n\nHere, players can find fancy new toilets, rugs, and paintings for sale, or fish with friends. The main attraction, though, is playing the Hot Pot card game. Playing awards one coin, winning grants two, and after the games wrap up players can queue to spend their coins at a prize wheel. One spin of the wheel costs two coins, and players can win high-end cooking ingredients, adorable plushies, or cool pirate decor.\n\nMany players like to enjoy the underground market as a chill social stop. After hunting in Bahari or talking with all the villagers in Kilima, it can be nice to unwind with a little Hot Pot. The minigame isn’t particularly demanding or competitive; you go around a table of four, trading tiles, until one player has collected three sets of three matching tiles.\n\nA certain faction of players prefers to play “fast” games, though, going around the table as quickly as possible. When one player is about to win, they call out the card they need, and someone else at the table trades it in. This style of play is designed to produce as many coins as possible. If people are sharing tiles, there are no prolonged end-game standoffs, and everyone earns more coins. And when one fast table sets up, and starts filling the chat near the tables with callouts, it can lead to a fight.\n\nOver the past few days, I’ve had multiple sessions of Hot Pot be interrupted by neighboring tables breaking out into arguments. The dialogue usually boils down to “Hey, you’re cheating!” and “No, we’re working together.” Of course, having a public argument is unproductive at the best of times; having one in an online game where everyone is subjected to the back-and-forth due to proximity chat rarely goes well. Everyone in Palia is polite on the surface, during daylight. But at night, fast table debates can break out, and next thing you know the chat is filled with accusations and unsavory insults.\n\nThis argument is part of the tension of Palia; it’s an online sandbox that’s meant to sustain a community, but it’s also a very chill and low-key experience that’s often best enjoyed solo. Most of the time, this works, and the player base is very well behaved. After Hot Pot games, players will line up to spend their coins and spin the wheel, and it’s considered a faux pas to run up and join a game at a table with four players already there. But the fast table debate has broken down the usual etiquette and civility, and I’m curious to see how — or if — Singularity 6 tackles these clashing priorities between players.",
      "# [Palia is finally on Steam, but it’s not all roses by Paula Vaynshteyn on 2024-03-27](https://www.destructoid.com/palia-is-finally-on-steam-but-its-not-all-roses/)\nPalia, the cosy MMO from Singularity6, is now officially available on Steam. However, despite a myriad of updated content added in time for the latest platform addition in Palia’s repertoire, the reviews remain firmly seated in the ‘mixed’ category.\n\nPatch 0.178 has bloomed (pun intended), and now Palia players can gather flower seeds by capturing bugs, attempt to conquer the Temple of the Roots, finally get their hands on the remaining Emberborn furniture pieces, and even pretend to get married in Bride and Groom attire.\n\nThough the biggest news to come out of Patch 0.178 and Palia’s Steam debut is the massive — both literally and figuratively — Frogbert. This plush grew to this gargantuan size thanks to a huge number of people adding Palia to their wishlist on Steam prior to release and will now be waiting for anyone who plays, new and veteran players alike.\n\nHowever, there is a dark cloud looming over the Steam release of Palia with the accompanying mixed reviews. The feedback comes from new and old players alike, but the biggest stand-out complaints include:\n\nOverpriced Premium Store items, with one bundle of purely cosmetic items costing more than major new releases and no way to earn cosmetic items in-game\n\nLack of ability to link Palia and Steam accounts if you’ve already opened the game, losing any progress made on other platforms permanently\n\nUpdates launched too quickly, many of which have rendered a previously functioning feature completely broken\n\nSevere lack of end-game content, despite the countless updates that have been received\n\nGame not advertised as beta or early access on Steam, despite this status never officially being dropped by developers\n\nFor an MMO, there is a severe lack of multiplayer content (unless you enjoy cooking)\n\nThese are just a few of the most prominent complaints that are coming up time and again in the review section of the Palia store page on Steam, and having spent over 200 hours in the game myself, I have to admit that I can see where they’re coming from.\n\nThese are the same issues that caused me to stop playing two months into the open beta. And although I rushed to download the game on Steam, hoping to try the numerous updates and hotfixes implemented, the negative reviews coupled with my own less-than-enjoyable experience with the game mean it’s going to sit in my library unplayed for a good while yet.",

You take note how his arms tense before bringing them down in a powerful swing, a rhythmic motion he repeats over and over as he carves the ore from its resting spot in the Earth. You find it not too dissimilar from a sculptor chiseling one's vision from the marble slab before them. His eyes were heavy and focused on the mass of stone he was chipping away at and clearly he had been at it for quite awhile by this time if the sweat that’s beaded along his forehead and down his temple is any indication. His hair is stuck to his face and you can follow the trail down to a damp shirt and skin that almost seems to lightly glisten in the lantern provided light.\"\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nYou find yourself in an unfamiliar world with a new life before you. Maybe... you'll help someone find a new life too?\n\nYou find yourself in a brand new world, memories locked away, and somehow worst of all, feeling like your naivety makes you stick out like a sore thumb. Wondering if you can even hack it in your new life, you’re determined to keep your head down and try to get by as best you can, wanting only to lead a simple, quiet life as someone not particularly noteworthy. Fit in.\n\nStrange dreams, one fiery young teenager, and her father prove to be quite the disruption to your plans.\n\n(Sequel to You're So Mine. Read that first, please!) You and Hodari have been so physically wrapped up in one another, but eventually there are things that need to be discussed. Sneaking around will eventually become frustrating, and yet you are not sure if this is one-sided. You don't want to complicate Hodari's life more than it already is.\n\nYou and Hodari treat yourselves to a day at the beach after weeks of hard work in the mines. But the labor has put a strain on the relationship in ways neither of you want to admit, and after a pleasant day on the coast of Bahari, it's time that you admit what you've been holding back this whole time.\n\nAll characters, game dialogues, and referenced lore are property of Singularity6.\n\nYou like to go to Bahari to collect resources just as much as the other humans do, but there are also other reasons to visit. Some just happen to be in the form of the resident miner who mentored you in the first place, and always told you to go prepared when you aren't home. It's a \"scorcher\" outside, and just when you were about to get into the act of mining, your pickaxe cracked. Without reparation materials handy, you could either go home, or ask Hodari for his help. You could have only daydreamed about ending up in his bed, but let's just blame the heat, shall we?\n\n--Please note that the story draws from in-game conversations, story line quests, and both In Game Player and NPC journeys. If you have not completed the friendship quest lines to level 4 with both Hodari and Najuma, or Romance questline to level 4 with Hodari, this story will contain spoilers for the game.

    "# Comprehensive Analyst Report on Singularity 6 and Palia\n\n## Company Overview: Singularity 6\n\nSingularity 6 (S6) is a game development studio based in Los Angeles, California, founded in 2018 by former senior talent from Riot Games. The studio focuses on creating large-scale multiplayer online games that foster community and social interaction. As of December 2022, Singularity 6 had approximately 163 employees [(Tracxn, 2021)](https://tracxn.com/d/companies/singularity-6/__3FLJUekCrZ_mhjxgq226hzU8ICQbj1Qe59f2jDYdVW0). The company has raised a total of $49 million in funding across three rounds, with its latest Series B round in July 2021 securing $30 million [(Tracxn, 2021)](https://tracxn.com/d/companies/singularity-6/__3FLJUekCrZ_mhjxgq226hzU8ICQbj1Qe59f2jDYdVW0).\n\nOn July 1, 2024, Singularity 6 was acquired by Daybreak Game Company, which aims to leverage S6's expertise in community-driven gaming to enhance its portfolio. Ji Ham, CEO of Daybreak, expressed excitement about the acquisition, stating, “S6 is an excellent addition to our development studios, renowned for their success in creating large-scale online games and content” [(Daybreak Games, 2024)](https://www.daybreakgames.com/news/dbg-s6-acquisition-announcement). Anthony Leung, co-founder and CEO of Singularity 6, emphasized the studio's mission to deepen players' lives through gaming and expressed gratitude for the initial player reception of Palia [(Daybreak Games, 2024)](https://www.daybreakgames.com/news/dbg-s6-acquisition-announcement).\n\n## Product Overview: Palia\n\nPalia is a free-to-play cozy online multiplayer community simulator developed by Singularity 6. The game allows players to engage in various activities such as farming, crafting, homebuilding, fishing, and questing, all within a vibrant and welcoming world. Palia was released in open beta on August 2, 2023, and has since expanded to multiple platforms, including the Epic Games Store, Nintendo Switch, and Steam [(Palia Wiki, 2024)](https://palia.wiki.gg/wiki/Palia_(Video_Game).\n\nAs of June 2024, Palia has attracted over 4 million players, with more than 100,000 active daily users. The game has received mixed reviews, particularly on Steam, where players have expressed concerns about its monetization strategies, lack of end-game content, and the perception that it is still in beta despite being marketed as a complete product [(PC Gamer, 2024)](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/mmo/palia-studio-singularity-6-is-the-latest-studio-to-suffer-layoffs/); [(Destructoid, 2024)](https://www.destructoid.com/palia-is-finally-on-steam-but-its-not-all-roses/).\n\n### Key Features and Gameplay\n\nPalia emphasizes social interaction and community building, allowing players to explore the world solo or with friends. The game features a persistent shared world, which presents unique challenges in terms of infrastructure and operational costs. Singularity 6 has utilized Unreal Engine for Palia's development, enabling robust networking and graphical capabilities [(The Software Architecture of Palia, 2024)](https://www.singularity6.com/news/software-architecture-of-palia).\n\n### Recent Developments and Updates\n\nSingularity 6 has been actively releasing seasonal updates for Palia, introducing new features and content to engage players. However, the studio has faced challenges, including layoffs affecting approximately one-third of its workforce in April 2024 and another round of layoffs in May 2024, which saw 36 employees let go [(PC Gamer, 2024)](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/mmo/palia-studio-singularity-6-is-the-latest-studio-to-suffer-layoffs/); [(GamesIndustry.biz, 2024)](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/singularity-6-laying-off-36-staff). Despite these challenges, the company remains committed to supporting Palia and its community.\n\n## Technical Infrastructure\n\nPalia's backend infrastructure is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), utilizing Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) for scalability and flexibility. The game employs ScyllaDB for data persistence, allowing for high scalability and efficient data management. Singularity 6 has implemented a cloud-native architecture designed for failure, ensuring resilience and quick recovery from potential outages [(AWS, 2024)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/gametech/how-singularity-6s-palia-conquered-cross-regional-gaming-with-amazon-eks-and-karpenter/).\n\n## Financial Performance and Market Position\n\nSingularity 6's financial health is bolstered by its funding history, with revenue estimates ranging from $10 million to $50 million. The acquisition by Daybreak Games is expected to provide additional resources and expertise to further develop Palia and expand its player base [(Leadiq, 2024)](https://leadiq.com/c/singularity-6/5c5264831f0000001d596fec).\n\n## Community Reception and Challenges\n\nWhile Palia has garnered a large player base, it has also faced criticism for its monetization practices, particularly regarding premium store items and the lack of in-game earning opportunities for cosmetics. Players have expressed frustration over the game's perceived slow progression and limited multiplayer elements, which have contributed to a mixed reception on platforms like Steam [(Destructoid, 2024)](https://www.destructoid.com/palia-is-finally-on-steam-but-its-not-all-roses/); [(Polygon, 2024)](https://www.polygon.com/24206154/palia-hot-pot-card-game-arguments).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSingularity 6 is positioned as a promising player in the online gaming industry, particularly with its flagship product, Palia. The studio's focus on community-driven gameplay and its recent acquisition by Daybreak Games may provide the necessary support to address current challenges and enhance the game's offerings. However, the company must navigate ongoing operational challenges and player expectations to maintain and grow its user base effectively.\n\nFor prospective candidates and investors, Singularity 6 presents an opportunity to engage with a dynamic and evolving company in the gaming sector, particularly as it seeks to expand Palia's reach and improve its community engagement strategies."
