It was 2020, and only two weeks later, the pandemic hit in full swing. We made the call to work remotely, and shared our experience in a previous blog post.\n\nSince then, we’ve announced our first game, successfully ran a number of testing phases, and grew to a company of over 135 people—all while supporting a remote work policy.\n\nBut one big question remained: What was our plan for returning to the office?\n\nWe’re happy to announce that S6 is going Remote Choice!\n\nWhat Remote Choice Means\n\nRemote Choice means we’re championing for our team to decide what’s best for them. They can choose to work remotely, return to our office, or somewhere in-between with a hybrid setup. Save for certain essential roles that require being onsite, this option will be available to our employees indefinitely. At the end of the day, we’re advocating for different needs, preferences, and circumstances of our Sixers, which is why we emphasize the word “choice.”\n\nAlong with the option to work at our LA-based office (and another we’re planning on opening in Orange County, CA), Sixers can choose to work remotely so long as they’re based in the following approved locations:\n\nUnited States\n\nCalifornia, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Michigan, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington\n\nCanada\n\nQuebec\n\nOf course, even with our employees spread across the continent, we’re still making an effort to bring Sixers together. We still want those casual chats and moments of joy that great ideas can come from, so office onsites, local team meet-ups, and digital events are in the works as we move forward.\n\nAnd Yes, We’re Still Hiring\n\nHere at S6, we believe online games can foster meaningful and memorable experiences. Palia will be our first attempt at realizing that vision, and development for it is heavily underway.\n\nTake a look at our careers page for our current job openings, or keep an eye out for future postings as we prepare for launch. We have over 30 positions available across a number of disciplines such as Art, Design, Engineering, and Talent Acquisition.",
      "# [Palia Community Demonstrates Player Excitement and Appeal of New IP](https://www.singularity6.com/news/palia-community-excitement)\nWe're pleased to share that Palia is showing significant momentum with strong community engagement numbers, including more than 600,000 signups, that demonstrate the growing appetite for an elevated cozy sim experience among a mainstream audience.\n\nWhen revealed in June 2021, Palia was instantly embraced by both core and casual gaming audiences. Within 3 months of the title reveal, more than 600,000 players filled out a survey to playtest the game, outpacing the number of followers of Steam’s most Wishlisted games. An impressive feat for a product still in development (if we don't say so ourselves!), demonstrating a strong desire from players for the type of meaningful online game experience that we're creating.\n\nWe're intentionally building Palia alongside players, as part of the studio’s approach to game development, so that S6 can respond to the community and make improvements at every stage, and over time. Even in the earliest phases of development, the studio cultivated a highly-engaged community that has grown to more than 100,000 Discord members. Additionally, we welcomed nearly 20,000 players across several Alpha tests in 2022 and 2023. In a single Alpha window, players logged more than 167,000 hours in a month, with top players averaging about 200 hours (!!!) of playtime.\n\nOur team is developing Palia to feel welcoming, playful and friendly, which resonated strongly with early adopters looking for a sense of community, acceptance and belonging. By having strong foundations in place for its community from the outset, Singularity 6 has built trust and respect with these early adopters, who continue to help shape the game and have become evangelists for its growing community.\n\nWe look forward to sharing more information about Palia and our amazing community in the future!",

      "# [The Software Architecture of Palia](https://www.singularity6.com/news/software-architecture-of-palia)\nSingularity6’s debut game, Palia, is a free-to-play cozy online multiplayer community simulator. A place where players can play alone or with their friends to experience a beautiful and welcoming world which can be explored and personalized.\n\nSocial interaction and a persistent shared world are key features of the game. But these elements are also some of the most challenging to implement, scale, distribute geographically, and operate at minimal operational cost and negative player impact.\n\nPlayers experience the art and soul that our development team has poured into the game, but the infrastructure that makes it all possible behind the scenes is hidden from view. We are proud of what our team has accomplished with Palia, and we want to spotlight the studio’s hard work, including what players don’t experience directly. We also want to share some important lessons learned during our journey; we hope that sharing the lessons learned while developing Palia can be useful to others facing similar challenges.\n\nNow follow us behind the scenes of our Palia development journey!\n\nGame Engine\n\nBuilding an online multiplayer title from scratch benefits from a robust and proven game engine. We made the choice to build Palia using Unreal Engine. Unreal gives us powerful tools to build with out of the box, such as a strong networking and replication library to build social features, a graphics pipeline to build a beautiful world, a powerful physics engine that can simulate complex environments, and so much more. We use Unreal Engine for our game servers as well as our client, which gives players a real-time interactive environment.\n\nEach instance of the game server currently hosts up to 25 players, and we split up each server by what we call a map. These can be permanent fixtures, including our central hub Kilima Village, or even temporary available experiences, such as our Maji Market, which was only available for one month during our Luna New Year in-game event. When players travel between maps in Palia, the game client disconnects from one server and connects to a new one. We will share more details on how this works in our matchmaking service deep dive section.\n\nThis synergistic model is crucial for our team: we can develop most of the logic for Palia inside the engine and deploy to both clients and servers. This allows anyone on the team to test both the game and the game server in editor mode, which has been critical for our development velocity.\n\nSpotlight: memory leakage\n\nUnreal Engine servers are commonly used in “session-based games,” such as Fortnite: games that start and end within a certain amount of time. Memory leakage is not a big concern for session-based games because a new server is spun up for a new match and destroyed when the match ends. Any leaked memory will be cleaned before the next batch of players begin playing.\n\nPalia is a persistent shared-world game and the lifespan of our game servers is variable depending on how players move through the game world. A single game server may remain online and serve players for an entire patch cycle which could be weeks. Memory leakage which is cleaned up regularly for a session-based game can grow and compound, and small leaks might end up consuming two or even four times the amount of Random Access Memory (RAM) proportionally affecting our operational costs.\n\nTo combat this issue, we invested in solutions to help us identify memory leaks, and we spent useful time designing nudges for players to travel between maps as to increase the likelihood that a server would empty out and be shut down.\n\nUnexpectedly and fortunately, increasing geographical distribution helped with this problem: hosting servers near players not only helps with latency (because it reduces the distance that signals need to travel); but also with rotating empty servers because players tend to play at the same times, making it rare that somebody in that region is playing in the middle of the night and increasing the probability of servers to become empty, shut down, and cleaned.\n\nThis screenshot from one of our monitoring dashboards shows the memory usage of a portion of our game servers over a24h period in Feb 2024. The trend of linear memory increase is clearly visible.\n\nServices\n\nThe game client and servers talk to our services for specific actions, such as logging players into the game, loading characters, saving progress, sending chat messages to other players, making purchased outfits are stored in the player’s closet and many more.\n\nWe loosely follow a “microservice” posture, in which we prefer to host many different services specialized on one player feature.\n\nWe use HTTP as the North/South protocol (in and out of the datacenter) while we use gRPC for East/West communication (for services talking to each other inside the datacenter).\n\nWe use Rust exclusively as the programming language for our services and we try to include both integration and load testing as part of the definition of “done” for key services, including matchmaking, player presence and player state persistence which represent the largest percentage of our request load.\n\nOur unit and integration tests are also written in Rust, but we use Locust to support and execute our load tests. Locust load tests are written in Python which is simpler to program. The ability to quickly write and modify load tests was beneficial to us and sped up adoption.\n\nSpotlight: Rust for Microservices\n\nRust is a beloved programming language by many systems programmers because it provides state-of-the-art protection against common software vulnerabilities (buffer overflows and race conditions, for example) without introducing any performance penalties.\n\nRust is also a modern programming language. It is surrounded by a diverse and vibrant community of contributors and a wide range of libraries and tools. Documentation is excellent (especially onboarding tutorials) and the compiler is surely one of the most helpful and user-friendly.\n\nOf course, no programming language is perfect. Rust's posture is heavily focused on correctness, which is generally beneficial, but comes with a significant upfront cost which is visible in our development velocity. Rust makes it very hard to “cut corners” and punt hardening for later. It is a very good quality when something that was supposed to be just a prototype becomes load bearing in production by sheer pressure of business needs, but it makes it hard to move quickly and with agility around shifting requirements (which is a constant in startups and game development).\n\nThe other issue was hiring and onboarding. Rust’s relative youth as a programming language makes it somewhat difficult to hire people that have production experience with the language. Although the language is very popular, few people have used Rust in a professional team setting. Most people who have Rust experience have only used it for personal projects. With this in mind, onboarding took much longer than we expected. We factored 90 days to get engineers up to speed, but it turned out to take at least 6 months for most of the team to get comfortable and confident with the language.\n\nWe are very happy with the performance, latency, scalability, robustness and security of our Rust services. But there are moments when we wonder how much opportunity cost was spent in forcing up-front solidity of every piece of this layer.\n\nWe consider it an advantage for the studio to have managed to amortize those onboarding costs and the maintenance costs of our services is indeed very low, but those thinking of following our footsteps down the Rust path, should be willing to allocate a significant effort to education and onboarding. These costs will likely reduce over time as Rust becomes more popular in production settings, but it’s unclear what that rate will be.\n\nSeveral of our services are interesting and sophisticated enough to merit more attention: player state management and matchmaking.\n\nPlayer State Management\n\nWe consider player state all the information that a game server needs to recreate the most recent game world experienced by the player. The architecture of our game is server-authoritative which means that game servers decide the state of the world and act as referees when game clients report inconsistent data (for example, because of time delay in transmission). We took this route because Palia is a social game so a player cheating or modifying their state could have a negative impact on the experience of other players. The risk of cheating is reduced when it's our system that ultimately controls player state.\n\nThe simplest way to persist state is to wait until a player exits a game server and have the server send this information to the database. Unfortunately, this makes state changes in that server vulnerable to the server itself crashing and losing that data (which is only kept in volatile memory for performance reasons). Instead, several times a second we check for player state changes, and if there are any, that data is immediately queued and sent to the database to be persisted.\n\nSpotlight: data first vs. schema first\n\nA source of contention around player state is the modeling lifecycle: who and what decides what is valid to be stored into such a state? Traditional data-modeling techniques suggest a “schema first” approach: the structure of the data (the schema) is created ahead of time and then only data that conforms to that structure can be saved into the database.\n\nThis has the advantage that the database validates the shape of the data. The disadvantage is that one has to know ahead of time the structure of the data needed… which can be challenging to coordinate across different teams.\n\nTo increase the ease with which game engineers and technical designers could work, we decided on a different model in which the structure of the data would be decided in C++ structs directly within Unreal and then marshaled and persisted in the database as a binary blob (using the Flexbuffer format). The schema is the struct declaration itself and we use Unreal’s runtime type reflection system to export the schema to our database.\n\nThe advantage of this architectural choice is that it enabled game engineers to develop features that required state persistence without the need for constant coordination. The downside is that the data is opaque to the database, which is more expensive to keep uniform and consolidated. This has required us to invest in additional tooling around the player state management system to validate, backup, modify and correct player state when it diverges from the expected structure.\n\nDespite the additional layer of development investment needed to provide hardening on top of what the database normally provides, we believe this architecture has significantly cut down the time required to deliver new features with data persistence, such as our most recent Luna New Year event.\n\nMatchmaking\n\nIn many competitive-style online games, matchmaking is the process of selecting people for a match. For Palia, matchmaking means matching the player with the game server that we believe will give players the best gameplay experience.\n\nThere are several dimensions that we take into consideration during matching:\n\nLocation - how far away the game server is from where the player is currently playing (because closer server means lower latency and lower latency means a more fluid and immersive experience)\n\nFriends - how many of the player’s friends are currently playing on that server (because the more people they know the more meaningful their interaction will be)\n\nPopulation - how many people are playing on that server (because the more people are playing the more alive the world feels)\n\nThe matchmaking system is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing us to add more signals to the matching algorithm over time if we desire.\n\nAnother crucial feature of the matchmaking system is the ability to distinguish “join” requests and “travel” requests. A join request happens when a player starts the game and wants to join. A travel request is a match required by a player leaving one map of the game and traveling to another.\n\nThe ability to distinguish the two allows us to offer priority to “travel” requests when the system is under load and there is high contention. This is because it’s far less disruptive for players to wait a few minutes to join and then wait only a few seconds to travel between maps, than one in which the delays are spread uniformly across all matching requests.\n\nThis screenshot shows a piece of the dashboard we use to monitor queue sizes and the distribution of times it takes for a matchmaking request (join or travel) to be satisfied.\n\nSpotlight: game-aware internal queueing and autoscaling\n\nEvery empty server running in the cloud without a player on it is a waste of money. On the other hand, there might be players who want to play and all of the game servers have their allocated slots filled so they would benefit from an empty server to land in.\n\nMany online games design “login queues” or similar ways to restrict the inbound flow of players and scale up or down the number of servers to meet the demand. Originally, this was our intent as well, but we realized we would benefit from a more sophisticated matchmaking design that could distinguish between joining and traveling. We also realized that the matchmaker had all the information it needed to control the size of the game server fleet.\n\nThis is how we came up with the Admiral: a component of the matchmaking system that oversees the fleet of game servers. The Admiral understands when the current fleet of game servers is insufficient to satisfy the number of players requesting a match and is able to ask the underlying cloud system (specifically Agones) to request the creation of more game server instances. Agones, on the other hand, is responsible for shutting down game servers that have been empty for some time.\n\nThe integration of autoscaling with matchmaking and the separation of concerns between the Admiral (scaling up) and Agones (scaling down) has served us very well and has managed to provide us with shock absorption to the game when things didn’t go as planned. Several times, the elasticity of these queues between maps have saved the team from having to bring down the game entirely to fix issues during misaligned deployments or unforeseen behaviors during load spikes.\n\nThis screenshot shows the view of the game servers fleet from the Admiral. Each line is really two lines: one for the “desired size” and another for the “actual size”. This information is used to tell the cloud orchestrator to spin up more game servers for a particular map type as they are needed by players being matched to servers that don’t yet exist.\n\nData Management\n\nOur architecture of loosely coupled software components wouldn’t be very useful without data flowing between them and being persisted, validated, or aggregated.\n\nDatabases\n\nOne of the most difficult elements of creating a shared perpetual world is constructing the ability for players to influence it (and one another) in a context that feels immediate and consistent. A key factor to provide a positive player experience is the choice of the database architecture.\n\nWe decided to use ScyllaDB as our main data persistence layer. ScyllaDB is a C++ rewrite of Apache Cassandra (originally created at Facebook and, in turn, heavily influenced by Google BigTable and Amazon DynamoDB), a distributed column store.\n\nThe biggest advantage of ScyllaDB for us has been its elastic scalability and its cloud native “design for failure” posture that aligned very well with ours. One significant advantage of ScyllaDB for us is the ability to attach replication strategy to a table but eventual consistency levels to a query. This gives us a lot of flexibility because in some cases we need consistency more than we need speed and we can tune that directly at the query level. This is not possible with traditional relational databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL.\n\nThis functionality is crucial, for example, when dealing with a persistent player state: we want the data to be replicated on multiple computers before we return a response to the game server. This means that both the game server and multiple database nodes have to die (at the very same time!) for that player state update to get lost. As far as we can tell, this has never happened.\n\nWe also use PostgreSQL (hosted for us by AWS) for the catalog of our outfits available for purchase in the game. We used a relational database here because we felt it was better suited for this particular job.\n\nAsynchronous Messaging\n\nAnother important part of the data management layer is the ability of software components to message one another asynchronously.\n\nWe have two of such busses:\n\nThe first for aggregates and collects telemetry for player behavior (which uses Apache Kafka, more on this later) and feeds our analytics and machine learning pipelines.\n\nAnother coordinates software components (for example, the control plane between the fleet auto-scaler and the game servers). This uses EMQX as the broker and MQTT as the protocol.\n\nWhy two? Mostly because they serve different purposes, have different strengths and weaknesses, and are managed by different teams focusing on separate outcomes. There might be value in consolidating things further in the future, but for now this separation is serving us well.\n\nSpotlight: MQTT and Apache ActiveMQ v5 (aka Artemis)\n\nThe use of MQTT as the message bus protocol for our game servers control planes was decided precisely to isolate us from lock-in of a particular broker implementation. In retrospect, this was a weak choice: MQTT is an IoT protocol and we were attracted by the fact that it was designed for devices with small power and low bandwidth. We wanted a solution that would be easy and cheap for the game servers to interact with and didn’t consume a lot of their resources.\n\nUnfortunately, many MQTT brokers simply implemented that protocol on top of their existing native systems. We picked Apache ActiveMQ v5 (aka Artemis) because it was established and it supported v5 of the MQTT protocol (which offered features we needed) but was written and designed before clouds existed and turned out to be incompatible with our preferred “loosely coupled components expected to fail” architectural posture.\n\nArtemis has been the source of much apprehension and tribulation. We ended up having to patch the software to fit our needs. We operated with a forked version in production just to keep it from falling over regularly (the MQTT layer and cross-regional federation layers did not work well together).\n\nWe have since migrated to EMQX which is a more modern MQTT broker, designed from the ground-up with MQTT in mind and we have not looked back.\n\nThe lesson learned here is that even established and battle-tested software might still end up performing poorly when utilized in a different context and with different operational constraints than was originally intended.\n\nData Pipelines\n\nAnother important principle of our software architecture is that we want to be able to observe and monitor how the system is behaving so that we can act on it effectively when behavior deviates from the norm.\n\nWe treat data differently based on whether the decision making that it supports is latency sensitive or not. In fact, we use completely different systems for low-latency decision support (seconds to minutes) vs. high-latency (days or weeks).\n\nSpotlight: player behavior vs. system behavior\n\nIn the past, we separated data based on whether it was about player behavior or software behavior. But we quickly realized that distinction was not very helpful in practice.\n\nFor example, a purchasing event from a player is technically a player behavior and insights gathered from them influence strategic decision making with high-latency (days or weeks). But such a high-latency reaction would be detrimental to both our players and our revenue if we didn’t get notified immediately if the frequency of purchases dropped outside of the normal range of operation.\n\nIt is generally true that data generated from the behavior of players influences decision making in aggregate and with high latency while events generated by the behavior of software systems influences decisions and actions that require quick reaction times. But our ability to route data based on decision making latency needs and not on the semantics of origin has made it easier to reason about data routing decisions, especially when the two pipelines are handled by different teams with different skills, strengths, and goals.\n\nObservability\n\nWe picked Prometheus as the time-series database powering the low-latency data pipeline and alerting. The key advantage here is the “pull” model in which it is Prometheus to “scrape” data from our software components, which makes it a lot simpler to maintain.\n\nWe also use Grafana as our visual dashboarding system querying the data stored in Prometheus along with Loki and Tempo to deal textual logs and tracing the flow of execution across several of our software components.\n\nLastly, we use Sloth to automate the generation of SLOs.\n\nAnalytics\n\nThe high-latency data pipeline revolves around Apache Kafka (managed for us by Confluent) which captures and routes the data as well as Apache Spark (managed for us by Databricks), which we use to aggregate and analyze the data.\n\nWe use Apache Airflow (managed for us by Astronomer) for monitoring and scheduling long-running workflows for data aggregation and analysis. Lastly, we use Tableau to power the visualization of the insights that result from our data analysis.\n\nCloud Infrastructure\n\nAnother development challenge is the “free-to-play” nature of our distribution strategy. This approach made it difficult to predict the amount of players that would play the game, especially around key events, such as platform launches, major updates, and in-game events.\n\nWe decided to be “cloud native” from the start because “elasticity” in supply of computation and bandwidth is a key advantage that cloud providers have over acquiring and maintaining our own server infrastructure; especially for gaming startups (for which capital is constrained) and when deploying across multiple geographical regions.\n\nCloud native for us didn’t simply mean: “run our programs on somebody else’s computer.” Cloud native for us meant designing a software architecture composed of small pieces that are loosely coupled and always expected to fail.\n\nWe call this “designing for failure.” Of course, we never want our systems to fail. However, we believe that resiliency in software systems comes less from preventing failure, and more from providing mitigations to such risks and the ability to restore service as quickly and automatically as possible. We want to design to reduce failure but we always expect it to happen, so when it does happen, our systems would not be surprised by it.\n\nKey components of this strategy were using Kubernetes as our orchestration system, Linkerd as our service mesh, Traefik as our load balancer and Agones to manage our fleet of game servers. We also rely heavily on the “infrastructure as code” principle, using Kustomize to help us keep our configurations DRY and ArgoCD to power continuous deployments.\n\nKubecost helps us measure costs, and we recently swapped from cluster-autoscaler to Karpenter to optimize cluster elasticity and to help pick the best server instances. This change allowed us to save a non-trivial percentage of our cloud costs by automating the selection of instance types to use to run our workloads.\n\nFor provisioning infrastructure we rely on Terraform and Spacelift. We rely on Vault to store secrets without our cloud environments. We also conduct chaos testing using Litmus.\n\nAnd we rely on a few different services for authentication and authorization systems, including FusionAuth for account management, Zendesk for customer support management, Stripe for payment processing, and Vivox for our in-game chat system.\n\nOur only cloud provider is Amazon Web Services which provides us computers, storage, and bandwidth across multiple regions: United States, Germany, and Japan. We also rely on Cloudflare for geo-aware DNS and load balancing as well as DDoS protection.\n\nSpotlight: Nomad vs. Kubernetes\n\nWe had originally chosen Nomad as our orchestration solution, mostly because it was perceived to be conceptually simpler and it was much more compatible with Windows workloads (which we thought we might need for testing purposes).\n\nUnfortunately, Nomad had one very significant problem: the momentum of the development community around it was significantly smaller than around Kubernetes. This had two significant issues for us: a) we had to develop in-house solutions that the community around Kubernetes had already implemented; and b) it was harder to engage the team with a technology that many considered an evolutionary dead-end.\n\nWe made the difficult call to switch our cloud orchestration system by using the argument that our development velocity would significantly improve and our operational risks would be reduced. This turned out to be very much the case and it’s a decision we would happily make again.\n\nBuild Systems\n\nThere are two primary concepts used in the building of Palia and its supporting services: the build platform and the build system. Historically, game studios lumped these two together around the primary continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) component. We borrowed some plays from large-scale build and release systems beyond gaming: using a heavily distributed approach inspired by some of our team members’ experiences in other industries, such as banking.\n\nTo power the build system we use Jenkins, but take care to draw a distinction between the software, and the underlying infrastructure upon which it runs and integrates. While related, these things are best served by intentional, separate configuration management and Infrastructure as Code practices which can quickly become unwieldy and complex if attempting to do so under a monolithic design. The result is a hybrid cloud approach to the build system. We use both an on-prem data center and Amazon Web Services, and one side of the architecture can be maintained without potentially negatively impacting the other.\n\nWe also took the time to redesign the initial version of the build system (Jenkins pipelines) around Unreal Engine’s native tooling, namely, BuildGraph. Doing so required a lot of work up-front as the old method was cobbled together between Jenkins Pipelines and Python scripts, but the declarative nature of BuildGraph tooling has allowed us to increase correctness, reduce build system maintenance, and increase flexibility such that we can build almost every target platform with minimal specific changes for each. A key component of this success was integrating with AutoSDK and creating a “standard library” of sorts in Jenkins to glue it all together.\n\nIn our latest version of the build platform we are able to mostly dynamically scale the number of executors based on demand. The build system can then simply act as a “glue layer” to distribute requested tasks among the available executors as parallel pipeline runs. Further, we’ve incorporated designing for Self-Service by other teams, such that they can “pick and choose” which artifacts they want built via a single interface. We call this the “Prime Pipeline,” which presents a series of configurable parameters and then schedules the running of “Sub-Pipelines” to do the work, passing those parameters as appropriate. This means that via the same Prime Pipeline interface, one Engineer could choose to build only one Platform Client from the library of Clients available, and one Server, getting only those two artifacts; or they could select everything and end up with every Client and Server we currently offer as targets.\n\nSpotlight: Capacity Management in a Hybrid Cloud World\n\nA trade-off we make for this level of granularity and distribution is the initial difficulty in managing capacity. We use several build executors of different types and had to really break-down our pipelines and how each stage would be distributed to the executors both on-prem and in AWS. Then we had to measure a single run of each pipeline to get more accurate numbers to use for calculating instance sizes, costs, expected load, and timings for stage and whole pipeline execution. This cost us a lot of time up-front, and while we are glad we did it, it is yet another piece of operational overhead which must be monitored, reviewed, and adjusted in order to remain reasonably accurate. Changing something as simple as the Node Label of a particular pipeline Stage can have serious impacts to all of the metrics we measure, most notably, build times. Unfortunately, there aren't a whole lot of “drop-in” or “off-the-shelf” solutions for these types of systems, so we have had to track these things manually, and then automate as we go to attempt to reduce the operational burden.\n\nFurthermore, managing two different sets of infrastructure is not for the faint of heart, or those unfamiliar with Hybrid Cloud management. While the patterns may be very similar, the implementation proved to be a lot more work than we anticipated.\n\nFor example, AWS and other cloud service providers make APIs available to interact on a very granular level with their exposed components. On the other end of the spectrum, even the most mature on-prem infrastructure providers rely on their own custom tooling for managing hardware components. This is why projects such as Ansible are in such heavy use in the IT industry, and S6 is no exception here as we prioritize the use of open source tools where possible to ease cognitive load and keep costs low.\n\nThe challenge that made this most difficult was the disparity in experience using this approach on our team members’ time. Some of us come from more of a Platforming background, others from a Tooling background, and still others from primarily a Jenkins Pipeline writing background. This is great for general cross-functionality within the team, but requires careful planning to execute well even among the highest-performing teams.\n\nVersion Control\n\nWe use two different version control systems to manage the development lifecycle of our code: Perforce for the game code, and git (hosted in Bitbucket) for everything else.\n\nUsing different version control systems is clearly suboptimal and not a decision we took lightly: git is generally preferred by backend engineers and is far better supported by modern development environments.\n\nUnfortunately, Perforce is very well integrated in Unreal Engine because that’s what Epic Games uses (the makers of Unreal Engine). Also, git isn’t really designed to work with very large binary files, and a lot of our in-game assets and original sources are giant binary files. Perforce works well in these situations.\n\nEarly on, we tried using git-lfs (large file storage), which is supposed to help with this problem but we gave up when we realized how much effort it would be to retrofit all of the Epic development tools (UnrealGameSync, for example) to work with git.\n\nWe sincerely wish we had a single consolidated version control system and code review workflow, but it is not a trivial exercise.\n\nSpotlight: Consolidated Repos\n\nOne of the issues we faced with git was that it was too easy and convenient to create new repositories, causing a proliferation of them. The biggest issue we faced was the inability to make changes that cross-cut different services at once. This created a lot of production overhead and reduced our ability to consolidate the behavior of services.\n\nWe considered switching to a full “monorepo” but many of us were unfamiliar with it and feared additional complexity and overhead that we had no additional development capacity to support.\n\nThe compromise we reached was a handful of consolidated repos in which many individual git repositories were merged into a single repository and then archived. All the microservices ended up in this single repository, but they could be developed, built, tested and deployed in isolation. This made it much easier to modify code across services (such as version dependencies) as well as simplifying the creation of libraries. This approach facilitated an incremental externalization of common functionality into modules that could be more easily reused across services, reducing copy/paste code duplication and reducing our maintenance costs.\n\nSaaS-y Open Source\n\nOne common theme you might have noticed in our architecture is that we prefer to depend on software that is open source and that we could host ourselves if we wanted/needed to. We also prefer to rely on a SaaS vendor that provides and manages this software for us instead of running it ourselves.\n\nThis offers us several advantages:\n\nWe are not locked into a particular cloud or vendor provider (as we could run the system ourselves if we needed to).\n\nWe can provision systems more quickly (our people don’t need to learn the intricacies of configuring them).\n\nLeverage vendor expertise to fix issues and/or edge cases when we encounter them.\n\nKeeps the vendor prices under control under our threat of shutting down our vendor contract and hosting the system ourselves.\n\nWe deviated from this posture only rarely and when there was no open source alternative that made sense for our business needs. However, we do believe this paradigm worked well for us and provides a way to fund and support further development of these open source projects. This, in turn, lowers our future risks by helping make the development of these open projects more sustainable (as these hosting vendors often employ contributors to the open source projects and continue to fund their contributions for mutually symbiotic benefit).\n\nConclusions\n\nIt’s rare to get access to the source code that makes up video games, so it’s rare to have the opportunity to learn directly from it. Even rarer is a view into the decisions and tradeoffs, the lessons learned, the paths not taken and those taken but with later regret.\n\nWe hope that this deep-dive on the challenges and successes of creating Palia’s software architecture provides some insight and inspiration for others facing similar challenges.\n\nIf you have any questions about Palia’s software architecture and development, or simply if you want to start a conversation feel free to reach out to us at hello@singularity6.com.\n\nSpecial Thanks\n\nThe list of people that contributed to this architecture is very long (see the Palia credits for the full list) and we wouldn’t do it justice to replicate it here.

      "# [Sixer Game Night 2024: A Night of Neon, Nostalgia, And Non](https://www.singularity6.com/news/sixer-game-night-2024)\nLast week, the Palian moons aligned for Sixers who participated in Sixer Game Night, an epic soirée where Singularity 6 stormed arcades in LA, Seattle, Chicago, and Las Vegas. The vibe was electric as the team gathered to celebrate our love for games, both digital and analog.\n\nThe festivities kicked off with a culinary homage to our childhood favorites. The menu was a mouthwatering spread of comfort food classics: pigs-in-a-blankey, chicken tendies, yummy sliders, mountains of crispy truffle fries, and fruit to stave off scurvy (Arrr!). And what's a Game Night without a few libations to toast our collective camaraderie of creativity?\n\nIt wouldn’t be a Sixer celebration without a lil’ Karaoke; that age-old tradition of belting out tunes with the confidence of Vanilla Ice (regardless of actual singing ability, of course). Several Sixers grabbed (and dropped!) the mic, belting out ballads known and niche. Several smart watches warned against heightened decibel levels. But “In The End,” “I Want It That Way.”\n\nOf course, Singularity 6 is a video game studio, and it’s the arcade where Sixers truly shined. The simulated dance battles were fierce, with team members stepping, hopping, and jumping in a mesmerizing dance of rhythm and coordination-ish. And the kart races were a sight to behold, with friendly rivalries emerging as racers chucked red, green, and blue (!!!) shells across the track for several photo-finish victories (to most folks’ chagrin). A surprise fishing game left us ‘reeling’ after reeling-in some outrageously-sized Tuna. And let's not forget the claw machine – a test of patience and precision as Sixers collected an army of ducks that now embellish several studio workspaces.\n\nBut beyond the games, the laughter, and the sheer joy of human connection; Sixer Game Night was a reflection of what makes Singularity 6 so special. It's the people – our team – who bring their passion, creativity, and enthusiasm to everything we do, whether it's crafting Palia’s next big feature, or quacking about their latest toy waterfowl.\n\nAs the night wound down and we said our goodbyes, it was clear that Game Night wasn't just about playing games. It was about building memories, strengthening bonds, and celebrating the incredible community that is Singularity 6. Here's to many more nights of neon, nostalgia, and nonstop fun.",
      "# [Meet Our Environment Artist, Maya](https://www.singularity6.com/news/meet-our-environment-artist-maya)\nAs Sixers, we like to showcase our small, yet mighty team and highlight their amazing abilities. This month, we’re introducing a few of our employees who are hard at work making our dream for a virtual society happen.\n\nMaya Mahalingam\n\nMaya joined S6 last year as our Environment Artist. She has a strong passion for art and was encouraged early on to explore these skills. Check out her work on ArtStation!\n\nGet to know Maya by reading our conversation with Maya below!\n\nHow did you get started in this profession and what drew you to a career as an artist (no pun intended)?\n\nI have been super passionate about art ever since as a kid, and I loved to draw and paint. I was always very sure that I wanted to pursue a creative career and do something different, so I did a Visual communication bachelors to figure out where my interest was. During my childhood, I remember playing a lot of GTA and NES games after school which fueled my curiosity even more. And so, I ended up working as an artist at a mobile game company and I really enjoyed the experience. I kept up to date on trends and looking into tools that are constantly changing in the 3D space and became super interested in VR. So, I came to the US to further my career and expand my knowledge by doing a Game Dev program at Carnegie Mellon. Since then, I've had the opportunity to work with multiple teams across games, VR and AR space for the past few years.\n\nWhen you were younger, how did you discover a passion for art?\n\nWhen I was growing up, I played tennis professionally for a while and art was like my side interest due to lack of time. But I still enjoyed going to art classes a lot. My parents really encouraged me to explore my creativity and I started painting and doodling whenever I could.\n\nWhat excites you most about being an Environment Artist?\n\nWhat I really like about environment art is that I get to translate my real world observations and bring them to life directly. And, the other nice thing about being an environment artist specifically is that I get to touch a lot of topics in the pipeline, be it technical or purely art itself because of the nature of the role. That I think widens my knowledge and interest of continuing to learn and grow. Also, I've found a recent love to write and share the process about my work and here's my last one: https://80.lv/articles/001agt-005cg-crafting-a-mossy-oakwood-forest-in-ue4-at-cgma/. I wish to continue to do more of that through personal work and our game here at S6.\n\nWhat brought you to LA / S6?\n\nIt was a combination of my interest in environment art, and looking to relocate to LA for personal reasons. So S6 was a great opportunity to be able to do both. I wanted to try something new and different after having worked in VR/AR projects, I wanted to work on a project where I could create a vibrant virtual environment that the players could spend hours exploring and having fun.\n\nWhat have you learned about yourself since becoming an artist?\n\nI think over the years I've learnt how much I can push myself to face challenges and try out new things. I've become more comfortable with accepting what I don't know and what I can do to fix that. And, definitely to be a good person, because at the end of day I think that's what counts.\n\nWhat things in life are still a mystery to you?\n\nHaha the question itself is a big mystery to me. Honestly, I see myself as a mystery because I'm still constantly trying to figure out my traits, my interests and where I'm heading towards in life. So, having to learn about myself and finding solutions for the questions in my head has been really interesting so far.\n\nOf the many things you do, which one makes your heart beat the fastest?\n\nArt! I think if you make something that you enjoy and if it’s something that people find fascinating then that's something to work on with pride.\n\nWhat are you currently working on, without giving anything away?\n\nCurrently I'm working on getting the different aspects of environment art as close to the art bible as possible. And, I’m working on getting Houdini engine setup for some procedural modeling integrated into our pipeline for customizable options in game.\n\nWhat is the one thing in life that makes you happiest?\n\nFirst thing that comes to mind is good food, especially dessert! I can literally eat a Tiramisu or a cake any time. If I am not eating a cake then I am probably baking or thinking about one :D\n\nFor aspiring kids who want to be an artist/designer one day, what advice would you give them?\n\nI would say following your passion is what brings the best out of you. Other than that if it has to be specific to becoming an artist, I would say keep yourself updated constantly. Train yourself to be in a position to be super adaptable to whichever tools become the standard. The industry changes constantly, so having a lot of self discipline and motivation I think is very important. And to make some time to work on personal projects cause I think that really helps to shine a light on your interest.",

I'm really sad to say but I cant recommend this game anymore since the priority is on the cash shop more then anything else. The game has been buggy and performing poorly for most of it's life and It hard to ignore when they find the time to come up with more and more things to shove into the cash shop.\n\nThis game has charm and is very fun if you are a fan of cozy games similar to animal crossing but want more then just bug catching and fishing. Characters are fun enough and the game is pretty good in the beginning so if you want something new to play its worth considering. The real issue is the lack of things to do, bugs and the lack of quests.\n\nI played this game for hours and almost everyday when I first started but after a point the content just stops and you have to wait for them to drop 1 or 2 new quests for the characters stories and it gets old. Try it if you want but dont expect it to keep its charm for more then 100ish hours.",

During that time, they have made many changes to the game's features to improve gameplay.\n\nYou don't have to pay anything to play, and anything that costs money is purely cosmetic. However, almost every update is about adding more to the premium store, rather than fixing bugs in the game that has been there for months, soon to be years.\n\nI'm giving Palia a positive review because it's a fun game to play, especially with friends. The community is also very helpful so that you can play the game alone and still get help doing tasks where you have to be several people to complete. Just be aware that there are many bugs in the game, and they probably won't be fixed anytime soon.",

I clocked 50 hours fairly quickly when I started playing, it really pulled me in. HOWEVER, the more time you spend in the world the more you see the gaping void that was papered over with a lovely cover. \n\nThere is no depth to the game whatsoever. The relationship system is incomplete so it looks like you can really go places but in reality they never finished it. They also created arbitrary obstructions such as a currency cap, absurdly few crop tiles for farming, and inventory/storage limits. The moment I started seeing how much work has been left unfinished and how these ridiculously limiting factors impacted my game-play, I lost interest. \n\nI stopped playing in December of 2024 and as of this post I returned to the game page to see if any updates have been made. I was not surprised when the only updates that had been made were additions to the games cash shop. At this point, their focus is on making items that people will buy because that gives them profit. \n\nHonestly, the player base is feeding the beast that has destroyed many a promising game. You see, people are buying the overpriced trash that is being added to the cash shop. Each purchase reinforces and further incentivizes the developer to continue prioritizing the cash shop over the actual game. Until players stop rewarding developers in this way, nothing will change and why should it? It is easy money for them to create a few items and rake in the money.",
      "https://steam/76561198009288134": "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-02-10)](https://steam/76561198009288134)\nTL:DR: Stardew Valley, Coral Island, My Time At Portia, My Time At Sandrock, the entire Harvest Moon series, Animal Crossing are only a few of the games that not only does what Palia tries to do, but they all do it better and with far more value for your time.  Is it still fun and pretty? Yes, but if you haven't played these other games first I highly recommend playing those games before investing any time / money in this one until it is more developed.\n\nCons:\nThis game is absolutely not in any shape to be selling 30$-50$+ items to its playerbase.  It is very much STILL in early access despite all of the developers, time, and money invested into this game.\n\nIs it pretty? Yes, play Coral Island instead.\nIs it expansive? Not that I've seen so far.  I've only seen 2 playable zones so far. There's another one on the way.  It feels really small to be spending 100s of hours in. Play My Time At Sandrock instead.\nDoes it have enough systems to keep me busy? Absolutely not, play any of the games I've mentioned.\n\nMajor key features it's missing are; \n1. Any sort of individual identity: Coral Island has recycling machines, earths spirits, an entire mermaid storyline and farming system - this game has nothing but knock off night elves from WoW\n2. Ranching: zero animal raising or item collection / processing but still plenty of recipes that require these items which HAVE to be purchased from vendors\n3. Pure Solo Play: players are required for endgame materials.  Yes it's a MMO but it is also a casual game, and a light populated one at that\n4. Extra / Alt characters: you can only make 1 character per account.  You can change your character's appearance for free, however you can never change your character's name\n\nPolitics: This game is riddled with it.  No genders only body type, constant references to the main themes of radical politics as well as cringey slogans being used all over the game, and I could go on.  For me this is a negative, however I'm just presenting this information for people to know before investing their time in the game.\n\nPros:\n1. Graphics are pretty if you enjoyed circa 2007 World of Warcraft Burning Crusade Silvermoon / Blood Elf area.   I appreciated that time period so I did enjoy the graphics.\n2. Ease of Play: Despite low budget looking animations, the controls feel very fluid and fun.  Hunting is my favorite part so far and it is very rewarding and easy to do.\n3. Ease of building / customizing: The building system in this game isn't anything new or special, but it is fun to use.\n\nOverall, it's still too early for me to recommend this game to anyone, despite me putting hours into the game.  It's just not ready yet.  It really needs to implement a travel system (horses / animal transformation for transportation / vehicles / something), some sort of specific identity to explore (mermaid / underwater forms, wings / skyform or farming, something to set it apart), and it desperately needs a thorough ranching system.  Otherwise, I suggest for people to wait until they're ready for a launch.",

No real content being pushed out hardly ever most updates showcase cosmetics that cost a lot of real money. Rinse and repeated events that barely changed from last season and don't work. After reaching endgame there isn't much of a point in playing. The housing item cap is still 3000 the storage hasn't been increased. Just overall a huge letdown and disappointment especially after enjoying the game for many many hours. Just sad and disappointing I had real hopes for this game",

Maybe this is on me, but the trailer and description made it seem like it was a coop adventure/village builder, but it reminds me more of Toontown than anything. There are plenty of good aspects, but they are small compared to the much larger inadequacies of the game.\n\nGameplay: 1/5 - I can see the potential, but there is just no substance. In the early stages you have to wait for hours to build a house because the crafting time in some of your machines are so slow. Farming/gardening is...boring - there is nothing to do. Hunting seems pointless because you can buy everything from a store (thankfully!). The housing plot is ultimately limited in space. The missions have you run around the two large maps JUST to talk to villagers or buy one recipe. Oh, and to return to your housing plot? You either can run all the way back or wait for the 10 minute timer to automatically teleport back. If you teleport, there is a queue so your wait time may be longer.\n\nGraphics: 4/5 - The game is very pretty and cozy. Im sure if you can suffer through the grind of actually building a big decorated house, the game would be astonishingly peaceful. Though, outside the housing plot and the main village(s) there really isnt anything worth looking at. \n\nSoundtrack: 5/5 - I really enjoyed the soundtrack. Its adventurous and inspiring. \n\nOverall: 2/5 - There is something underneath all the grinding you need to do. Im sure eventually the game is all it seems to be - a peaceful home decorating/designing game where you can unleash your creativity and see how your friends build. But to get there...well, it isnt fun. If there was more survival, adventuring, an actual open world, and simply more in depth systems, this game could transform into something great where you can survive and build with friends! But if those arent in the roadmap, thats okay, I'll take my time elsewhere!",
      "https://steam/76561198170400501": "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-01-28)](https://steam/76561198170400501)\nFor a game with the multiplayer tag, it doesn't actually do anything with it. You very rarely interact with other players to complete content and it feels more like a solo game with co-op elements once in a blue moon. I didn't really feel invested to keep playing after a couple hours. The world itself felt small and empty, with each map having a hard lock of only 25 players in a zone. This game has yet to be fully released, despite no longer being marked as Early access, so maybe that's the reason why it feels like it's missing something to keep up engagement.\n\nThe characters seemed fine, I liked some more than others but unless I invest some serious grind time into the game I can't say for sure if I have any favourites beyond what they look like. Unfortunately, the game play loop doesn't really feel engaging enough to sink hours into it, and I was left wondering what all my progress was for aside from building furniture and decorating my space. While what's there already is much more in depth than the majority of games you'll see with similar mechanics, it's hard to build a game around that being the only selling point. \n\nNot to mention given that the game is free to play, the developers have stated that the cash shop is their only means of funding the game. While I'm not condemning the presence of the cash shop (as it's a necessary mechanic for ftp games to exist) it does mean that updating the premium cash options take priority over content updates and the items within are very expensive for what they are. There's also no way for free players to gain new outfits or farm the cash shop currency through the game which creates a class system of free players vs cash shop whales and divides the player base (however unintentionally). This also makes Jel, one of the few npc's I was curious about, just a mouthpiece to try and bring you into the premium cash shop. His store is completely devoid of items for players to buy, his comments about having new stock and new designs feel like the devs advertising to players rather than Jel himself, and his store register only opens the cash shop menu, rather than an in game merchant menu like the others. While the cash shop isn't intrusive by any means, knowing that there's no way to customise my character and make them unique outside of spending real life money left a sour taste in my mouth.",

Gameplay feel is very primitive like you are playing a PS2/Xbox/Wii game. They haven't bothered updating the main story in a year while being in early access for 2 years. Also the premium store is like 10 pages long with basic outfits costing 40 dollars, please make it make sense. Community is still riddled with toxic positivity and will jump on you if you have any critiques of their comfort game.

I enjoyed the game for a few months and even spent quite a bit of cash on it to support the devs, but then things began to get worse over time. Here are my main issues with the game:\n\nThe romance options are great and they have even opened up some new candidates over time per the players requests, but you never actually get to go on an of the dates with any of the characters. They always find some excuse and then you end up running around doing a minor quest to help them out and make them like you more. This happens with every single candidate, and you never really get to do anything out of the usual. It's a little disheartening considering part of the cozy aspect of the game is to date/romance characters. I found it to be extremely disappointing.\n\nThe glitches were something that were always present, but as time went on and promises of fixing them, they only seemed to get worse. More and more bugs cropped up, lots of them being the exact same issue from a previous patch that they swore they fixed. This leads to the game being unplayable, as certain quests and weekly gifts are cooked meals and when an ingredient is glitching or something isn't working, you can't complete it and essentially have to wait for the developers to fix it. Usually, I am very patient about this, but the issue is that the bugs aren't being fixed at all. They claim they are, but never seem to fix anything that is a real problem. This leads me to my biggest gripe about Palia and it is the way that the developers are deciding to handle the criticism of their inconsistencies. When told about triggering seizures due to the glitching, their response was that they were going to fix it asap due to concern for their player base. When they essentially told these players they fixed the issue, and very obviously didn't, they were politely confronted only to get upset and tell players to \"give them the benefit of the doubt\" in spite of their previous promises to actually fix the issue. I find that to be irresponsible, and frankly untrustworthy when they could just be upfront about their struggles to fix visual settings or toggle to turn off the visuals that will cause these seizures.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't say it's a terrible game, but I personally cannot support devs who do not care about their player base and continue to act unprofessional in the face of problems they themselves have created. If I could go back and never put any money into the game, I would in a heartbeat as things are far too expensive for a game that doesn't actively fix bugs and in-game issues that make it unplayable from week to week. I may reconsider in the future if they ever address their poor communication with people in the disabled community and their lack of bug fixes, but otherwise, I have to be upfront about my experience and it wasn't good.",

The gameplay loop, while not groundbreaking, offers a relaxing and cozy experience with a focus on decorating and building your dream .. farm home, I guess. While the repetitive nature can set in after a while, the game provides a variety of activities to keep you engaged, from fishing and bug catching to gardening and interior design.\n\nOne divisive aspect is the cooperative harvesting of higher-tier materials. This encourages social interaction and teamwork, adding a refreshing layer to the gameplay. However, solo players might find this mechanic a bit limiting at times.\n\nOverall, Palia is a fun and charming game that delivers on its promise of a cozy and relaxing experience. Despite some minor drawbacks, I recommend giving it a try, especially if you like a good cozy vibe game and decorating a home.",
      "https://steam/76561199084746202": "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-02-09)](https://steam/76561199084746202)\nThis game isn’t really for solo players looking to just kick back and play on their own — it’s much more rewarding when you have support from friends. There are plenty of items and tasks that require two or more people, so if you’re going it alone, it'll be impossible to progress the main quest after the first few. However, if you’re someone who loves being part of communities, joining Discord servers, and making new friends, this is the game for you! You don't need your current friend group to play it with, there's sooo many discord servers and people wanting to make friends. If you don't necessarily want to make friends, you can still message in server chat your coordinates on the map and someone will come by and help you farm items you can't do alone, or you can request 4 items per day that you need and people will fulfil your request.\n\nIt’s hands down the cosiest, no-combat game I’ve ever played. The quests aren’t overly challenging but still enjoyable, and there’s always something to do, from cute events to decorating and designing your housing plot. Even though I’m usually not a fan of farming games, this one is super fun and easy to get into. You don't have to worry about fall damage, villagers sleeping (even though they sleep you can still go to their door and speak to them!). There's not much you can't do, it's still a grind, not an easy run, but an enjoyable one!\n\nThat being said, there are still a fair number of bugs, like items in buildings sometimes becoming invisible or villagers appearing underground at your plot, which can be a bit annoying. You’ll likely need to restart the game to fix these issues. But it’s still a fairly new game, so I’m sure these bugs will be ironed out over time and don't really take away from the experience as they're quite minor. \n\nOne thing I’d love to see in the future is a shop for different hairstyles to make character customisation a bit more detailed. I’m a big fan of character creation, so more options to customise your avatar would be a great addition!\n\nWhat really stands out, though, is the community. I’ve joined 'cooking parties' in game from Discord, which help level up your cooking skill and earn money in the game super fast. The people are incredibly kind, helpful, and generous. It’s honestly one of the best gaming communities I’ve been a part of. If you’re into making friends and love a chill, cosy vibe, this game will become your new favourite! \n\n*TL;DR*: Great game for those who enjoy teamwork and community! Solo players may struggle past the early quests, but there are plenty of Discord servers to make friends and get help. It’s a cosy, no-combat game with fun quests and relaxing housing design. Some bugs like invisible items and villagers underground exist, but they’re minor and likely to be fixed. A character customisation shop for hairstyles would be a great addition. The community is friendly and helpful, making it perfect for those who love a chill, social vibe!",

You can choose to travel alone, but it is more worth while with friends. So far the community is supportive and kind.\n2) Story. I have yet to finish the main story, but it has been entertaining.\n3) Characters. Diverse and interesting with their own personalities. Work to befriend them with gifts, daily chats, and quests. Romance available.\n4)Skill growth. The skill growth spans several areas: farming, hunting, mining, crafting, fishing. It keeps you moving and sets reasonable goals.\n5) Farming. The farming sim is reliable and easy, yet with challenges that get easier as you level up your equipment and skill. Plenty of plants to offer, and the upgrades are worth it.\n6) Fishing and bug catching. Easy with it's own challenges. A wide array of fish and bugs that vary depending on location, time, and equipment. You can display star quality ones in your home.\n7) Foraging, hunting, and mining. Similar to other games with a rarity level and the equipment to match. Tools become available to help ease the process, and friends make it easier.\n8) Cooking and crafting. Unlock an array of recipes as well as equipment to keep your focus up (your energy so to speak that impacts the exp earned). Cooking with a group proves more rewarding.\n9) Build your house and share with others. You buy writs and crafter rights at the town hall to expand your home. Set your home in a tour for others to see and view and rate other homes. Doing all of this gains you rewards. The building mechanism is good, but could use improvements. You can buy house expansions from the town hall, and additional buildings. Easily moved. You can purchase recipes for building blocks to build, and these lock together for easy movement. You can grow trees and flowers to place, and, as noted earlier, you can place tanks with bugs and fish! See cons for minor irritants.\n10) Customize your character with clothing, hairstyles, hats, and pets. The character customization is easy and seamless. \n\nPalia is free, though there are in-game purchases you can make to support them.\n\nCons (my personal take):\n1) Probably one of my largest annoyances is the inability to group move many items on your plot. You can work around this by stacking on movable items, but if you want to plant a ton of flowers in grass? You had better want them where they are!\n2) Glitches. Some of the glitches can be annoying and frustrating, but overall they are few and the devs are active in corrections.\n3) Night doesn't get dark enough in my opinion. I know it's silly, but I like the challenge of creating light.\n4) Although I appreciate the no time limit, not resting for energy seems...odd. Almost like cheating.\n5) Interaction with pets. I mean, they are cute, but that's it. Nothing but following you around. I would like to see at the minimum petting interaction! Skills and leveling would be great!\n6) No mounts. But there is a cart system. Yet there is a lot of running around.\n7) No weather changes. I always appreciate this in farming Sims, but also can add additional challenges.\n\nI highly recommend this game, and if you enjoy it ass well as I do, then remember to support the dev team. <3",

Please figure out a way to fix this.... I see in the statistics for these quests that only 2% of players have completed them. It's out of balance.\n\nI think this game could be amazing if the Main Quest issue is fixed. No one wants a game that it too hard to play.",

If you want a casual, slightly grindy (if you're competitive) and no-pressure game of farming and rich NPC interactions, go for a try or two. \nThere are events throughout the year so maybe play during those timings for different experiences.

There are a lot of complaints on the reviews section & in some player forums which made me think that it might be sub standard. I think it is a great game, for those who like animal crossing or medieval dynasty. It has had so much effort and time put in, & the amount of options for decorating are incredible. To the complaints I would only say this- the game is free! I would pay $40- $50 for it (I am used to PlayStation & Nintendo prices). In fact I spent money on skins because I felt so guilty not paying anything for the experience. \r\nWhat I love:\r\nThe number of options for furniture/decorations.\r\nThe number of different plant-ables (flowers).\r\nThe monthly markets.\r\nThe NPC storylines are great (the Subira ones worried me a bit, but they turned out well).\r\nI like that they add new plots & new areas, some of the other games I have played kind of end & having fresh content means I can play for longer.\r\n\r\nWhat I would alter:\r\nI would love to see what is in Tamala's store & have potions.\r\nI like having symmetry in my veggie patch, please add another soil slot, or have say 8 veggie/berry slots & then when you hit higher levels allow 2-4 \"tree only\"soil plots.\r\nI find it weird that the apple tree \"dies\", it would be better that it is planted once on a \"tree only slot\"and then just gives apples every 5-8 days rather than having to keep replanting it.\r\n\r\nWhat I would add:\r\nI would love an extra colour option in the furniture makeovers (something like black/white/wooden look). \r\nI would like some long skirts, there are a lot of short skirts and jeans etc.\r\n\r\nThink it is great, full credit to the devs for this :).",

I love that humans are considered almost mythical and here your character pops up out of nowhere and the entire community of non humans is so curious about your character. The only thing that's meh about this game is the grind for materials. The crafting is amazing, gathering the materials, especially the more rare ones is tedious, especially when it's a 5:1 or better ratio. Also the interaction/friendship aspect goes a little slowly. It's almost like you can grind the friendships to get them to where you need them for certain quests, or you can grind materials...there doesn't feel like there's a good balance there yet. Overall though, a nice game, good for when you want to get into a game and lose track of time but easily enough to stop where you're at and come back to reality.",

I love these types of games and why I played Disney Dreamland but waiting to meet different villagers and unlock different things gives me a little sour taste. One thing I really enjoy about the game is the character creation however. I will give it a 5/10 just because every outfit is 20+ dollars. An MMORPG like FF, BDO, WoW or anything like I can see since the playerbase is so massive. But for a mainly singleplayer game its a bit much. I get its a new game and the devs are trying to build the community and such which takes a huge amount of money; but to have the most boring clothing and all the nice clothing purchasable is killer to me. Why not make some pieces of clothing craftable or obtainable through certain missions?",

Character creation is really good, the in game relationship system is a favorite, I love the resource gathering aspect of it, inventory/map/quest log etc are all easy to navigate which is great. I love the different areas you can explore and all the little achievements you can get playing.\r\nFor the things I dislike starting off with 1. Storage. Stacked items take up way more space then I was expecting. Rather then a stack of 20 wood taking 1 spot in your storage chest it is actually taking up 20 of your spots even when stacked/condensed which gets really annoying when you're trying to build up your resources. \r\n2. Crafting items feels super unbalanced in the way that each item requires a ton of resources which is a lot of time gathering, time refining, storage space all for one item. Some crafted items also just feel pointless. For example, you can craft repair kits for your tools when you upgrade them to keep them at max power. Each crafted kit gives you 20 kits which I assumed 1 kit = full tool life. WRONG. If your tool is nearing the end of its upgraded life its going to cost all if not more then your 20 kits to fix which feels insanely unbalanced. Makes \"upgrading\" your tools feel more like a \"downgrade\" and an expensive chore to keep up on.",

The game is still being developed with updates being implemented.\n\nThis game is not designed to rush from the start to end, someone can min/max, stress to hit every event and rush all the time to try and squeeze in every aspect of the game each time it comes around but that was not what it was designed for.  This is a cozy game which is focused on a relaxing game-play. An in-game date is matched to a real world hour.  So if you miss something you can just get it again an hour later.  The day cycles are not designed to be a FOMO, just to allow a variety of events to take place throughout the in-game day such as rotating fish or bugs during select hours as well as NPC's go about their lives and work, socialize and sleep too.  The designer of Palia included that you can still interact with the NPC's even if they are sleeping at time so your never really missing out. \n\nSome peoples comments that they feel that gold becomes the bottleneck to slow down play and that is somewhat true.  It is more difficult in the beginning to earn gold as you are learning the game, improving your tools, expanding your housing plot(s) and more. If you mainly want to just unlock things you can focus on the main quest line. If your not in a rush however there are side quests, discoverables, story lines that expand the games lore and flushes out the NPCs. Just about any game has progression to keep the game moving and interesting.  This is a free game with the option to purchase cosmetics if you opt to do so but it is by no means required. In general the community has been positive, helpful and considerate to events working as groups.  The game rewards playing together but does not takeaway from playing solo if you have a preference game play style.",

I have yet to get all 4 flow seeds and i have been trying for 2 months now. \r\n\r\n2. The decoration limit of 3k.

Super simple. \r\nHowever, with the overly added popups of \"information\" it literally tells you nothing of what to do. How do I get I fabric or leather? How do I get back to my quest marker that's no longer there because I reached the place but had to go back for something? Why can I not fast travel to places I've already been? Why the eff do I need to arc my arrow to shoot something literally 5 feet in front of me? \r\nI really did not enjoy this game. It annoyed and frustrated me more than anything. As someone who greatly enjoys fishing, farming and the such, this game was honestly a waste of my time.",

Palia is in a category of its own. You can design your own house and decorate how you want in whatever style you choose. You can make food, farm, hunt, fish, and even friend and date npcs. I was never interested in stardew valley or animal crossing. I don't really play cozy games but I must say Palia is a vibe. \r\n\r\nThat being said while I do like the game and its lore a lot I do not like the co-op aspect in that you are required to work with others for certain resources. Its hard for me to talk to others one on one and/or ask for help when most people don't even talk in chat, just because someone is helpful doesn't mean they want to be friends. Don't get me wrong some talk and seem friendly and if you ask a question you're likely to receive an answer but I also feel like I'm on someone else's time when in a group unless I know the people well. I don't want to rush because someone is waiting and I don't want to make others feel rushed because I'm waiting. And some days its just hard to ask for help. It's not that I'm anti social you'll see me talk in chat its more that I'm awkward social and don't want to feel forced to make friends.\r\n\r\nThere's unique crafting in the game as well but I wish used items you no longer want had a better use than to just be tossed, maybe like a revert system, even if you lose some materials, or a lower sell price, auctioning even. \r\n\r\nAlso, it would be neat if you could design or even craft cosmetics or outfits though I'm not sure that's a thing. (Still learning things) You can change your look and beginner outfit for free and as often as you want but there's nothing else unless you buy it which I get, they gotta make money to run the game somehow, but I wouldn't mind a few pieces of craftable clothing and cosmetics here and there. I feel like I don't have a personality because there's nothing on my person that's unique lol\r\n\r\nAll in all very good game would recommend 8/10.

I can't believe I've played this simple game more hours than I've played Baldur's Gate III. Some days you want something to play where you know you can relax and nothing's going to try to kill you. It's fun doing the friendship/dating quests. I like that there are secrets to unravel, plenty of things to craft and collect. Decorating your home is fun. The game's genuinely free, they don't bug you to buy stuff all the time but I ended up buying a few cosmetic things just because I love the game so much and wanted to support them.

The world is visually stunning, and the character customization options are extensive. I've enjoyed exploring the different areas, completing quests, and interacting with the friendly villagers.\r\n\r\nOne of the highlights is the in-depth decorating system. Players have a lot of freedom to customize their homes with a wide variety of furniture, decorations, and even landscaping options. This allows for a high level of creativity and personalization.\r\n\r\nHowever, some aspects of the game can be frustrating.

Its a quaint little cozy game, perfect to play alone or with friends! The community online are always so helpful and the mini game's are fun and easy to pass time with in between long waits. The romance options are fun, wish they were a little more in depth personally but I'm 100% a critic on that front, so disregard that bias. Without a doubt worth looking into and downloading. I can only explain this game like the following; if Animal Crossing met Stardew Valley, then had a child and that child met Legend of Zelda and had a child. This is that second child. I've spent 145 hours in this game as of when im writing this review. I expect to have more.",

I LOVE how different it is from anything else I’ve played. It’s open-ended, relaxing, and somehow still packed with so much to do! The quality is insanely good, the art style is beautiful, and the gameplay is just perfect. It’s one of those games that pulls you in, and before you know it, hours have passed.\r\n\r\nThere are so many quests, and I love how every skill, whether it’s hunting, fishing, cooking, or foraging—feels meaningful. Upgrading your tools and progressing takes time, but that just makes everything feel so rewarding. And the decorating?? Don’t even get me started! There are SO many options, and I could literally spend hours just making my home look cute.\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite parts is the party system because you actually grow and level up together. Playing with friends makes everything even more fun, and it feels like you're always working toward something. It’s just such a cozy, immersive world that I never get tired of.\r\n\r\nAlso, I HAVE to mention the cosmetics, yes, they’re expensive, but honestly?? They are SO pretty and beautifully designed that I don’t even mind spending my money on them. Every outfit and accessory looks amazing, and I already know I’m going to be buying way too many! \r\n\r\nThe Palia community! Calling them nice and welcoming is AN UNDERSTATEMENT!!! They are sooo nice, always helpful, and just make the game even better.\r\n\r\nIf you love games that let you explore, chill, and customize every little thing, Palia is 100% for you. Even in beta, it’s already amazing, and I can’t wait to see how it evolves. Easily one of my favorite games right now! ❤️\r\n\r\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 10/10",

It's your typical farming simulation RPG. I partially don't like it though because there is no PVE combat(I personally hate PVP). If there were some PVE combat, similar to what Stardew Valley has, then I would give this game 10/5 and 1000/100! At least an optional \"dungeon\" or cave instance that you don't NEED to complete but you *can* complete for some extra stuff would suffice. That way players can choose to do it. So for those who just want the farming sim, they can still have that without combat. Then for those who like to play it all, farming AND combat(PVE not PVP), an instance or cave with some monsters you can kill with a bow or sword would be an excellent(and welcome) addition to the game. Probably would sell more copies too! Especially since there is some talk about forging weapons by NPCs, why not have some PVE action in there too?\r\n\r\n I got this game thinking there was some sort of combat. Like a 3D Stardew Valley and I was so excited. Then I saw a comment about how there is no PVE combat and I immediately lost interest. At least make it an optional feature. Id like to refund the game otherwise, please.",

But I had to reupgrade it and it downgraded. People have mentioned that having to grind out resources is a problem.. It is. Having to find and grind out the individual ores is a CHORE, and maybe it's better with the community, but I shouldn't have to struggle because I like playing and doing things on my own. \n\nAfter 27 hours and my axe broke I was so annoyed that I had to gather all of my things, re-smelt them (which isn't instant.. it takes time like a mobile game would) and then i could go toward that next upgrade I was working on. It's annoying that there's no automated resource gathering for things you've already gotten and it's frustrating and punishing.

If not for that one issue, it would probably be one of if not my favourite game ever.\nFirst things first, the game overall is perfect. The graphics are great, the gameplay feels smooth and enjoyable, the soundtrack and atmosphere are top notch, the story is super immersive and the characters all have deep personalities and their own stories to explore. Everything in this game is done perfectly, it's just an amazing and very emotional experience, that you can enjoy along with a great, kind and very active community.\nYet, after not even 60 hours of slow gameplay, i finished the main questline, all the active side questlines and all the character questlines that interested me. I didn't have a single active quest. I started grinding fishing and bug catching for the night sky temple, which was much tougher than other quests but still really fun, and did some tiny quests that appeared along the way. Yet, after a while i just realised that i'm chasing something that's not there. The game was super enjoyable, fun and immersive but after finishing the main questline which turned out to be much shorter than i expected and i REALLY took my time completing it, the game turned to me searching for something to do cause i was too attached to the experience.\nTechnically in game it says that this is still a beta, but the steam store page showing it as a full experience is just misleading. Even though the only microstransactions are purely cosmetic, i still imagine that someone who payed for some cosmetics after seeing how great the game feels would be disappointed after realising that the game feels more like a demo than a finished, long term mmo experience.\nIt would be an amazing game that i would spend my money on, if it had at least 20x more content.\nAt this state, it's still worth playing because it's free, but prepare to be disappointed.\nI love this game and it pains me to say it, but it's not worth getting into cause all you're gonna end up with is a bitter aftertaste and a thirst for something that was never there.",

But not only that disappointed me. I was really looking forward to winter time in Palia because i just love winter seasons in games and i thought i will see pretty view of snow and decorations everywhere. But that didn't happen.

Yesterday alone, I had to have restarted a solid 4-5 times. This is worse on the Switch (do yourselves a favor and wait till a stable release if you want to get it for switch). \r\n\r\nWhen designing me character, I could not find a decent haircut for males. They all look so feminine and extremely...... yeah, (IYKYK) I mean, they use body type A and B so this isn't really a surprise. \r\n\r\nThe whole friendship thing into romance thing is just slow. You climb friendship slowly, and is timegated. It looks liked they took a page from Blizzard. \r\n\r\nBiggest thing I think it's missing is a collections page. Seeing what fish you've caught, what bugs you caught, crops harvested, and so on. \r\n\r\nThe rubberbanding makes me think I'm plating LoL for the first time when it released. \r\n\r\nBut, I will give credit where credits due. If they remove the Type A - B body types, and added some additional hairstyles that suit the male body frame, thats a bonus (and something that gamers want). \r\nThe biggest thing that needs to be looked into is the game breaking tool bugs the most though. Easily replicated, and if they wanted to hit me up with the steps to replicate it, happy to supply (I legit could not find a bug report form). \r\nThe graphics as a whole are cute, but a lot do look ripped right from Fortnite (environments and housing), not going to complain about that, I do personally like that design. \r\n\r\nAs soon as they fix the game breaking bugs, Ill swap to a hell yes recommendation.",

The game's blend of crafting, cooking, and farming is a joy to experience, and the ability to share these activities with friends adds a layer of warmth and community that's hard to find in many games. The developers have clearly put a lot of love into creating a world that feels alive and inviting, with each character and location having its own unique charm.\n\nWhile the game is still in its early stages, the potential is immense. The developers have shown a willingness to listen to the community and make meaningful changes, which is a breath of fresh air in the gaming industry. The graphics are stunning, and the attention to detail in the world design is impressive. The game's focus on exploration and discovery is a highlight, with each new area offering something new to see and do.\n\nHowever, there are areas where Palia could improve. The game's progression system can feel a bit grindy at times, and the lack of a robust multiplayer experience can be a letdown for those looking for a more social gameplay experience. The premium store, while not intrusive, could be better balanced to ensure that players feel rewarded for their time and effort, rather than just their wallet.\n\nDespite these minor drawbacks, Palia is a game that I find myself returning to time and time again. It's a perfect blend of relaxation and challenge, and the sense of community is something that's truly special. I'm excited to see where the game goes from here, and I have no doubt that with continued support and development, Palia will become a staple in the cozy gaming genre.",

I love this game, there's few things I would change except adding more decorations, rugs and plants but that's just me being picky at that point. Please please please buy more server space, it just makes you not want to play.",

Sometimes when small companies make a game and it hits big, they tend not to hear the voice of their fans. They now have money and why should they? But so far this company and game has still kept in touch with its fan base. That hits HUGE with me. It makes such a difference for investing in the game. If you dont matter to the game then its easy to move on, though sad game companies chose that path. \r\n\r\nI am someone who likes tasks and achievments and things to do. I also value and need a good community. If the chat is toxic Im out and un-installing fast. Life is to crazy atm to spend time in a game that brings you anything but joy. So for this game you can go achievments and hunting and plushies. Or you can spend time building your home and playing hot pot games, or even better you can do all that. Their are no time limits as we palians say its easier to be kind then not. Their are also tons of videos you can watch before choosing this game to make sure its right for you. I am mostly a solo player but their are tons of palians who will group up with you quickly. We received this growable furniture that was from shared party xp. I groaned, \"oh no i have to find a group\"...but it went wonderful actually. We all grouped up and made sure people had parties so they could get their furniture too. It was a nice way of doing things here and there. so watch some videos and then decide. But for me, I recommend it and it is nice and casual and relaxing.",

The world is compelling and intriguing. The quests for discovery of who you are as a human in this world of Palians play like a solo dungeon crawl full of clues and puzzles to unfold a bigger sense of the world. If you enjoy the grind of farming and gathering, you can spend an entire game play session doing just that and never get bored! Or if you'd rather interact in a more meaningful way, you can build relationships with all the Palians who each have their own unique story and personality. They also unlock quests and challenges as you continue to get to know them, which feeds into your greater knowledge of the world outside the boundaries of Kilima!

And those patches come around sooner than we realise (every 1 month theres usually something new). \n\nGraphics are nice and a lot of the times I use the camera mode to take ingame photos. Hunting is a lot of fun, there can be a few bugs at times regarding shots or glitchy animals, but usually its pretty smooth. Mining and bug catching are my favourite, (anyone that see's my ingame plot will know that) as its simple but also makes good Palian moneys. The players, especially the regulars, are amazing and friendly and because of that I've made many new friends because of Palia. \n\nPalia still has so much potential to grow, and with the new Elderwoods update soon to come, we all are hoping they will nail it.

But!..\r\n\r\nYou have good graphics (for an M(?)MObasebuilder indie project), you have good NPC's, with not too deep, but well-written stories. \r\n\r\nBut mainly - the gameplay and mechanics. \r\n\r\nImagine, you play, let's say, Hogwarts Legacy. And you have gameplay about making potions. Well, \"have\" is a too big of a word. You bring ingredients to cauldron, press a button, then running around like a fool for a minute. Not ten minutes, that will allow you to do something while its bubblin'. Not instantly. A minute. Of nothing to do.\r\n\r\nAnd here you have Palia, where to cook something - you need a few different stations, in multiple quantities, and you need to PLAY at each of these. I won't say that it is helluva minigame, but it is interactive, and its fun. And its better than Hogwarts Legacy, a AAA game in Wizardring(may be misspelled) world universe.\r\n\r\nAnd you can sense that in all of game contents. Its made with passion and devs think about their players, IMO.\r\n\r\nOh, and the community. Well done, Singularity 6.\r\n\r\nA con for that would be that it is HARD to create male character that is not looking like total gay. Don't get me wrong here, I don't mind that, and I can understand from where this is going, but I want to have a choice. Yes, female char is a choice, I know.",

With that said, I cannot recommend the game, every update feels like it's another push to being a cashgrab, with them now even introducing a monthly sub style - kind of similar to how gacha games have this monthly sub where, when you log in daily, get some currency. Might be worth if you feel like wanting to buy all the cosmetics but honestly, it's so pointless. Instead of making the game more stable - everytime I play I have to restart the game atleast once because something get's bugged - they just push the premium shop more. After you've finished what is similar to bundles in stardew valley, there is not much to do besides grinding for materials to craft furniture to decorate. I do like how decorating works in this game, you can clutter up everything which is quite fun, but that's about it. Multiplayer is kind of a joke aswell, wish that you could own a plot of land with a friend for example and work on it together. So no, while I will probably continue playing on and off, wouldn't recommend to new players.",

There are alot of what seems like pointless and purposeful inconvenience features, you'd find in many mmo's like wow for example, but without a way to buy your way into convenience which i wouldn't want either but it just seems like they are pointless, for example the most obvious one, is the 30min time limit before you can go to your map and click on the return home button, most of the game i've simply just closed it or simply waited instead of doing anything because i wanted to do a specific thing, like go into ruins which require a glider to get to, so i grind for the glider but there are several progression locks and other things preventing me from doing so, i achieve this after a while and am completely underwhelmed and was when i reached the ruins just now not interested because the fun of discovering the game was killed by the meaningless time i spent doing meaningless things. i wouldn't usually be so annoyed but i did want to enjoy this and i do like the aesthetic. however i just can't reccomend this when the time sucking features within this game ruin even wanting to entertain learning about any sort of lore or story happening, when i started the game i actually enjoyed the characters now i couldn't care less because their dialouge boxes is just another thing taking time away from doing other things. /: and i really really like my home, but im not sure if i have the motivation to return. although i most likely will.. because i still haven't finished decorating it.",

I've only had this game for a couple weeks and it's almost never failed to bore me. The artwork is beautiful, the mechanics are decent to work with, the story is really interesting. My favorite part is the social choices you can make. If you want to trade plushies in the Underground and talk to other players and make friends that way, awesome! If you want to just ignore everyone for the story, go for it. It doesn't look like there's a \"wrong\" way to play, it seems very open and I love that.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do with there was more world to discover and move around in. There's a lot already, but it just feels like there could be a little more. I mean this is the case in a few games I've played, but here especially as it's an MMO. I've tried looking just today for other MMO games to scratch that itch but Palia seems to be the only one I can find. Regardless, definitely a top tier game in my book.",

So if you like games like that, then i'd recommend it but please keep in mind the massive issues that hide behind the tags of being \"Cozy\". Side note, this game IS IN OPEN BETA. It is NOT full release yet like they like to lead you to believe, and have BANNED people from the Official Discord for pointing it out. Now lets get into it.\n\nPros:\n- Cozy\n- Cute environment\n- Great for mindless gaming and hanging out with friends\n- Cute Concept\n\nCons:\n- Terrible execution\n- Money hungry leads (they had 50 million to do this project and lost most of it from over-hiring and poor monetization)\n- As said above; Poor monetization\n- Premium shop gets more releases every monthly patch than ACTUAL CONTENT. 15-20USD to buy a PET and around 30-70 for the outfits, some of them having special VFX that do nothing in-game other than idle animations\n- Ported over to Nintendo Switch BEFORE it was even stable on PC\n- Leadership has said they're very much uninterested in listening to any sort of positive / constructive feedback from the community.\n- VFX issues that FLASH and HAS given people seizures. \n\nThere's more but i have a limit here. so ill leave it off with a couple of Con posts from past Singularity 6 Devs:\n\n\"The Leadership does not actually listen to people. They smile and nod while people talk, but then don't act on the things people say; they just explain why the thing they decided is what we're doing. Tragically, they probably think that they are listening, but they're not. They're hearing, but they're not listening. When people say things that they don't want to hear, they ignore it. This is both internally and externally. There is almost no insight into why new players try Palia and stop playing. They instead focus on what the most die-hard players like.\"\n\n\"The leadership of S6 truly drove Palia into the ground. It breaks my heart that a project where 200 folks poured themselves into it, got ruined by poor decision making made by a handful of people. They hired massively talented people, truly the best in the industry. Just to ignore their wisdom and experience.\"\n\nThanks for reading if you did. \n\nEdit: i have 188 hours on Steam, and probably another 500 on the standalone launcher before steam release and have spent most of that time in the Discord.",

Quests are mostly fun to do and there is all sorts of things here. Gardening, mining, tree chopping, exploring, fishing.  You can talk to NPC´s and befriend them, which opens new quests.

If you loved Stardew Valley then you are in for a treat.  I passed this game up when I saw a review saying there were too many in game purchases you have to make, but that is simply inaccurate.  The only purchases you make are simply cosmetic for new clothes, virtual pets, and landscapes to build your home on.  You can play this game for free no problem if you don't mind running around in basic wally world clothes.  I also read a review that said they felt the MMO aspect of the game was tacked on, and I disagree.  This game is way more fun to play with other people and you can find plenty of Palia groups on discord that will help you do that.  The community of players is super chill and helpful, and I can't say enough good things about them.  It's really the community that makes me want to continue to keep playing.  I feel like the writing is pretty solid and some of the characters have some real depth to them.  The game is still in beta, and while there are some bugs, I haven't experienced anything that has made me have to stop playing the game; all you have to do is take a moment to hit a loading screen and switch servers and the bug will go away.  I'm excited that the makers are adding new content and a whole new map is set to be released in early 2025.  I would say you can expect to get 250 hours out of this game before you've unlocked all the major upgrades, and some people continue to play the game even after a full year.  If you want this game to have longevity, you'll really have to enjoy the decorating / home building aspect as well as collecting the in game plushies.  Good games make me want to start playing as soon as I wake up in the morning, but this game exceeded that and made me want to stay up all night.",

This game is the epitome of adorable with its vibrant landscapes and charming characters that make you want to befriend every single one of them.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment you start you are welcomed into a world where you can craft your own little slice of paradise. Whether you're planting flowers catching bugs or just chilling by the riverside with your new pals everything in Palia is done with such a gentle soothing vibe.\r\n\r\nThe character customization is a bit lacky because of the paywall of outfits but if you can you should support and buy one outfit. I mean who wouldnt want to dress up their avatar in the cutest outfit while theyre out gathering resources or cooking up a storm? And speaking of cooking its not just about making food but also its about sharing moments with your in-game buddies just like a real-life potluck but with magical ingredients!\r\n\r\nOne of the best and sweetest parts of Palia is its community. The game encourages teamwork without any pressure making it the perfect place for those who love cooperative play but arent into the competitive scene. You can work together to build explore or unravel the mysteries that hide beneath the surface of this enchanting world.\r\n\r\nThe visuals are just heart-meltingly beautiful. With its soft pastel palette and whimsical designs every corner of Palia looks like its been painted with love. The music adds to this cozy ambiance making every little activity feel like a warm hug.\r\n\r\nAnd lets talk about that storyline - full of mysteries and lore that gently unfolds as you play. Its like being part of a bedtime story that you never want to end!\r\n\r\nIn essence Palia isnt just a game but its a getaway to a place where every day is a new opportunity to find joy in the simplest of activities. If you are looking for a game to unwind with to make friends and to indulge in some delightful escapism Palia is your new cozy home. Totally recommend diving into Palia for a heartwarming adventure, chill and cozy gameplay and sweetest community!",

Im sorry its a bit ridiculous. Id love to play this game more because you can decorate your home and expand and can romance villagers, but the running around for 30 minutes trying to navigate this huge map is too much of a chore without any spawns/waystones, So I really tried but i wont be playing until theres waystones implemented of some kind, and that timer on your home teleport is AT LEAST lessened because 20 min is way too much. \nalso it says its multiplayer, but theres literally nothing to do with other players, they just run around the map, idk if the team will add some kind of multiplay or co-farm but if they removed multiplayer thered be absolutely NO difference or change, kinda dissapointing since i wanted to play with my friend.\n\nOther than all of that, this game has a lot of potential and i def recommend for a free game, but i warn you you will be running around more than half the time.",

The glitches are tolerable, if annoying, but it's the intense focus on overpriced, paid content that I can't get behind. The main story line is also lacking, and there's not enough content in general for me to really appreciate the game. I'll continue to push my grievances to the side until the next update, but I'm not holding out hope tbh.",

I have sunk quite a few hours into it now and I am still uncovering new quests and mechanics I didn't know about. Here are my favourite things about Palia.\n\n- The amount of decoration options you have for your home plot is amazing. It's also incredibly easy. You grow trees and flowers for the plot and create beautiful pieces of furniture.\n- The grind for items is real. You will spend ages fishing, chopping trees and mining rocks but for me it didn't feel that bad. Maybe it is different for others but I had fun!\n- The store is surprisingly cheap, not more than the average big Fortnite skin, and for a free game it makes sense too. The outfits and gliders are cute.\n- The story and NPC's are amazing! It's so interesting to be the human in this new world after the age of humans. I can't wait to see where the story goes from here. The villagers as well are adorable and all have their own personalities. I am partial to Jina and Hodari.\n- The map is gorgeous! The art style and designs of locations and buildings are amazing. I can't count the number of times I just stood in a flared grove watching the pink dust fly into the sky.\n- Mechanics are so amazing here. The flared trees and fishing is so fun. I love fishing for once. I own enjoy fishing in this game and Far Cry 5!\n- Progression is wonderful. You unlock dialogue with certain NPC's and join associated clubs when you reach level 10, gaining new tools, recipes and other fun items to help you along.\n- With the tools given to us, the community is so wonderful! Everyone is so nice and the gifting system makes it good fun to help others.\n\nFew cons\n- Customisation options are lacking a little bit but I'm not too fussed.\n- The RNG from fishing and bugs is a bit too hard for me. After fishing for 4 real life days I still don't have the fish I want.\n\nBar that it's perfect! The game is wonderful and I can't wait for it continue. The devs are doing a great job and I urge you to play it and if you enjoy it drop a few coins on the cute outfits and pets you can buy through the premium shop!",

      "https://steam/76561198275121876": "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-01-22)](https://steam/76561198275121876)\nBefore I get into my review, I want to note that while my Steam profile shows just over 60 hours in Palia, I’ve played the game far more through the client. I participated in its alpha phase and spent additional time playing directly through the client before it became available on Steam.\n\nI was initially drawn to Palia because it was pitched as the ultimate cozy farming/life sim game... combining all the elements I love in an MMO setting. It felt like a dream game in theory. However, that initial promise has shifted dramatically.... the game no longer even markets itself as an MMO (It did in development phase. There's 25 ppl per instance). \n\nWhile updates have been announced periodically, they often feel like a letdown for me. It seems the focus is mostly on paid premium content like outfits, pets, and tool skins. While those cosmetic options are nice, what the game really needs is GOOD engaging content.\n\nThe housing and decorating system is the highlight of Palia for me. Compared to other cozy games, it stands out for its creativity and flexibility, allowing for freeform building if you have imaginative ideas. Unfortunately, the rest of the content feels too repetitive and boring. Hunting, for example, involves just two animals. Earning money can be frustratingly slow, especially for players who don’t have a lot of time to invest into the game.\n\nHere are some suggestions for improvement:\n\n-Introduce ranching and the ability to gather ingredients like eggs, milk, and butter yourself instead of relying solely on the shop\n-More open world animals (even if not solely for hunting)\n-Add events and cute cutscenes with romance partners to make relationships more interesting\n-Create more open world activities and events that would encourage players to gather for fun, meaningful rewards\n\nThere’s more that could be done, but this is already getting too long. If you enjoy the game as it is, that’s great! However, for me, Palia feels like it has a lot of untapped potential. While I’ll hop on occasionally, it doesn’t hook me the way other farming and life sim games do.\n\nI don't recommend for the long term, but you can try it out for yourself.",

However, the experience is locked behind real time paywalls from grinding for resources and spending hours running around the world to waiting hours and days of actual time for things to happen in game. They claim to promote a social environment, and then have the servers be multilingual. You cannot socialize effectively with players who do not speak the same language. The NPC's are not interesting to talk to. I don't think this is a bad game per se, and since most of the issues are game design related all of them could be fixed easily, but as it stands I cannot recommend sinking time and energy into this.",

You only have limited time to get the rewards. In chappa chase you have to get 25 in one event. I have yet to see anyone get it. There are only a total of about 100 to get in the time limit with 10-20 people chasing them. There is a card game where you compete against 3 other people, yet you need to get 10 wins. The event runs for 1 week and there are only 12 times a day the event is active. Then you will have to wait for ANOTHER YEAR to try to get them again.

      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-01-22)](https://steam/76561198080011584)\nI have played this game for many more hours then my steam profile says as I spent a lot of my time playing on switch. I'm really sad to say but I cant recommend this game anymore since the priority is on the cash shop more then anything else. The game has been buggy and performing poorly for most of it's life and It hard to ignore when they find the time to come up with more and more things to shove into the cash shop.\n\nThis game has charm and is very fun if you are a fan of cozy games similar to animal crossing but want more then just bug catching and fishing. Characters are fun enough and the game is pretty good in the beginning so if you want something new to play its worth considering. The real issue is the lack of things to do, bugs and the lack of quests.\n\nI played this game for hours and almost everyday when I first started but after a point the content just stops and you have to wait for them to drop 1 or 2 new quests for the characters stories and it gets old. Try it if you want but dont expect it to keep its charm for more then 100ish hours.",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-02-02)](https://steam/76561198242302292)\nI have been following this game since the summer of 2021, and have been playing it since it was first released on August 10th, 2023. During that time, they have made many changes to the game's features to improve gameplay.\n\nYou don't have to pay anything to play, and anything that costs money is purely cosmetic. However, almost every update is about adding more to the premium store, rather than fixing bugs in the game that has been there for months, soon to be years.\n\nI'm giving Palia a positive review because it's a fun game to play, especially with friends. The community is also very helpful so that you can play the game alone and still get help doing tasks where you have to be several people to complete. Just be aware that there are many bugs in the game, and they probably won't be fixed anytime soon.",
      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-02-03)](https://steam/76561198021455793)\nThis game had loads of potential, HAD. I clocked 50 hours fairly quickly when I started playing, it really pulled me in. HOWEVER, the more time you spend in the world the more you see the gaping void that was papered over with a lovely cover. \n\nThere is no depth to the game whatsoever. The relationship system is incomplete so it looks like you can really go places but in reality they never finished it. They also created arbitrary obstructions such as a currency cap, absurdly few crop tiles for farming, and inventory/storage limits. The moment I started seeing how much work has been left unfinished and how these ridiculously limiting factors impacted my game-play, I lost interest. \n\nI stopped playing in December of 2024 and as of this post I returned to the game page to see if any updates have been made. I was not surprised when the only updates that had been made were additions to the games cash shop. At this point, their focus is on making items that people will buy because that gives them profit. \n\nHonestly, the player base is feeding the beast that has destroyed many a promising game. You see, people are buying the overpriced trash that is being added to the cash shop. Each purchase reinforces and further incentivizes the developer to continue prioritizing the cash shop over the actual game. Until players stop rewarding developers in this way, nothing will change and why should it? It is easy money for them to create a few items and rake in the money.",
      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-02-10)](https://steam/76561198009288134)\nTL:DR: Stardew Valley, Coral Island, My Time At Portia, My Time At Sandrock, the entire Harvest Moon series, Animal Crossing are only a few of the games that not only does what Palia tries to do, but they all do it better and with far more value for your time.  Is it still fun and pretty? Yes, but if you haven't played these other games first I highly recommend playing those games before investing any time / money in this one until it is more developed.\n\nCons:\nThis game is absolutely not in any shape to be selling 30$-50$+ items to its playerbase.  It is very much STILL in early access despite all of the developers, time, and money invested into this game.\n\nIs it pretty? Yes, play Coral Island instead.\nIs it expansive? Not that I've seen so far.  I've only seen 2 playable zones so far. There's another one on the way.  It feels really small to be spending 100s of hours in. Play My Time At Sandrock instead.\nDoes it have enough systems to keep me busy? Absolutely not, play any of the games I've mentioned.\n\nMajor key features it's missing are; \n1. Any sort of individual identity: Coral Island has recycling machines, earths spirits, an entire mermaid storyline and farming system - this game has nothing but knock off night elves from WoW\n2. Ranching: zero animal raising or item collection / processing but still plenty of recipes that require these items which HAVE to be purchased from vendors\n3. Pure Solo Play: players are required for endgame materials.  Yes it's a MMO but it is also a casual game, and a light populated one at that\n4. Extra / Alt characters: you can only make 1 character per account.  You can change your character's appearance for free, however you can never change your character's name\n\nPolitics: This game is riddled with it.  No genders only body type, constant references to the main themes of radical politics as well as cringey slogans being used all over the game, and I could go on.  For me this is a negative, however I'm just presenting this information for people to know before investing their time in the game.\n\nPros:\n1. Graphics are pretty if you enjoyed circa 2007 World of Warcraft Burning Crusade Silvermoon / Blood Elf area.   I appreciated that time period so I did enjoy the graphics.\n2. Ease of Play: Despite low budget looking animations, the controls feel very fluid and fun.  Hunting is my favorite part so far and it is very rewarding and easy to do.\n3. Ease of building / customizing: The building system in this game isn't anything new or special, but it is fun to use.\n\nOverall, it's still too early for me to recommend this game to anyone, despite me putting hours into the game.  It's just not ready yet.  It really needs to implement a travel system (horses / animal transformation for transportation / vehicles / something), some sort of specific identity to explore (mermaid / underwater forms, wings / skyform or farming, something to set it apart), and it desperately needs a thorough ranching system.  Otherwise, I suggest for people to wait until they're ready for a launch.",
      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-01-25)](https://steam/76561198093918767)\ndo not recommend this game /now/, in its current state, but i really hope i get to come here in the future and edit this to say i've changed my mind\n\n-\npalia has a lot of potential, but the company seems intent in driving it all into the ground.\n\ni'll start by saying that as of right now, jan/2025, this game is still in beta despite it not being made clear here nor on the switch. you'll have to pay very close attention when you boot up the game to find the tiny little 'beta' in the game's login screen. and as beta game, it has very, /very/ limited content. patches are monthly, but the only things they bring are premium cosmetics - /all/ cosmetics and pets cost real $$$, and they're not cheap, either, but they also don't bring anything new to the game or your character aside from ✨looking cute✨; even the pets only just follow you around and you can't even interact with them, pet them, nothing. content updates are very few and sparse, and even the seasonal events are simply a copy of the previous year. \n\nthe environment is gorgeous and i'm personally very invested in the lore; there's still so much to discover, but after burning through all of the main story quests in like two weeks, i've been forcing myself to find other things to do, because a beautiful world only goes so far. i'd cut it some slack for being in beta - if they at least were honest about it. the community, on the other hand, is a blessing. for the majority of the time you'll find kind and helpful people, especially on the discord, but ingame too. people will share resources and answer questions, and everyone tends to be very nice. it's a breath of fresh air from other multiplayer games.\n\nspeaking of community - the thing that hurts the most is the blatant disregard from S6 for our feedback. certain issues can take months, if not a whole year to be addressed - i'm looking at you, snowball flashbang. palia is marketed as a cozy, comfy game, yet it has issues with VFX and flashbanging which put player's lives at literal risk; mini-games and plataforming mechanics which render certain main story areas unplayable for disabled people; a history of miscommunication with the player base, and so many other instances that show us they just don't care as long as you're buying their cosmetics. last year a broken interaction prompt held back friendship questlines with 3 NPCs whose friendships are connected for /three months/ while they kept silent about it.\n\nalso and hey, if you're starting this game from steam, they won't tell you, but you /have/ to create a palia.com account when given the chance. trust me. the first time you boot this game you'll want to add your email when the popup shows and you're gonna wanna go to palia.com and try to 'recover your password' to actually create a password, because you /are/ going to have bugs you'll want to report and you /will/ need a palia.com account to do it. but they won't tell you. so i will ✨\n\n-\nanyways 3/10 because i actually think this game is pretty and relaxing, and it /can/ go places!.. but not until S6 decides to do it.",

No real content being pushed out hardly ever most updates showcase cosmetics that cost a lot of real money. Rinse and repeated events that barely changed from last season and don't work. After reaching endgame there isn't much of a point in playing. The housing item cap is still 3000 the storage hasn't been increased. Just overall a huge letdown and disappointment especially after enjoying the game for many many hours. Just sad and disappointing I had real hopes for this game",

Your efforts and time isn't respected.\r\n\r\nFarming crops will not grow unless you're repeatedly logging in.\r\nEquipment that you've spend time and resources upgrading, reverts back to its previous form because durability reaches zero (quickly).\r\nRepair system gated behind a profession unrelated to other professions that require repairing system.

      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-02-07)](https://steam/76561198143935600)\nSo. Maybe this is on me, but the trailer and description made it seem like it was a coop adventure/village builder, but it reminds me more of Toontown than anything. There are plenty of good aspects, but they are small compared to the much larger inadequacies of the game.\n\nGameplay: 1/5 - I can see the potential, but there is just no substance. In the early stages you have to wait for hours to build a house because the crafting time in some of your machines are so slow. Farming/gardening is...boring - there is nothing to do. Hunting seems pointless because you can buy everything from a store (thankfully!). The housing plot is ultimately limited in space. The missions have you run around the two large maps JUST to talk to villagers or buy one recipe. Oh, and to return to your housing plot? You either can run all the way back or wait for the 10 minute timer to automatically teleport back. If you teleport, there is a queue so your wait time may be longer.\n\nGraphics: 4/5 - The game is very pretty and cozy. Im sure if you can suffer through the grind of actually building a big decorated house, the game would be astonishingly peaceful. Though, outside the housing plot and the main village(s) there really isnt anything worth looking at. \n\nSoundtrack: 5/5 - I really enjoyed the soundtrack. Its adventurous and inspiring. \n\nOverall: 2/5 - There is something underneath all the grinding you need to do. Im sure eventually the game is all it seems to be - a peaceful home decorating/designing game where you can unleash your creativity and see how your friends build. But to get there...well, it isnt fun. If there was more survival, adventuring, an actual open world, and simply more in depth systems, this game could transform into something great where you can survive and build with friends! But if those arent in the roadmap, thats okay, I'll take my time elsewhere!",
      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-01-28)](https://steam/76561198170400501)\nFor a game with the multiplayer tag, it doesn't actually do anything with it. You very rarely interact with other players to complete content and it feels more like a solo game with co-op elements once in a blue moon. I didn't really feel invested to keep playing after a couple hours. The world itself felt small and empty, with each map having a hard lock of only 25 players in a zone. This game has yet to be fully released, despite no longer being marked as Early access, so maybe that's the reason why it feels like it's missing something to keep up engagement.\n\nThe characters seemed fine, I liked some more than others but unless I invest some serious grind time into the game I can't say for sure if I have any favourites beyond what they look like. Unfortunately, the game play loop doesn't really feel engaging enough to sink hours into it, and I was left wondering what all my progress was for aside from building furniture and decorating my space. While what's there already is much more in depth than the majority of games you'll see with similar mechanics, it's hard to build a game around that being the only selling point. \n\nNot to mention given that the game is free to play, the developers have stated that the cash shop is their only means of funding the game. While I'm not condemning the presence of the cash shop (as it's a necessary mechanic for ftp games to exist) it does mean that updating the premium cash options take priority over content updates and the items within are very expensive for what they are. There's also no way for free players to gain new outfits or farm the cash shop currency through the game which creates a class system of free players vs cash shop whales and divides the player base (however unintentionally). This also makes Jel, one of the few npc's I was curious about, just a mouthpiece to try and bring you into the premium cash shop. His store is completely devoid of items for players to buy, his comments about having new stock and new designs feel like the devs advertising to players rather than Jel himself, and his store register only opens the cash shop menu, rather than an in game merchant menu like the others. While the cash shop isn't intrusive by any means, knowing that there's no way to customise my character and make them unique outside of spending real life money left a sour taste in my mouth.",

Gameplay feel is very primitive like you are playing a PS2/Xbox/Wii game. They haven't bothered updating the main story in a year while being in early access for 2 years. Also the premium store is like 10 pages long with basic outfits costing 40 dollars, please make it make sense. Community is still riddled with toxic positivity and will jump on you if you have any critiques of their comfort game. They added a mechanic to let you grow rare resources at your in-game home but people will still curse you out for chopping the tree that they and their friends were claiming.",

      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-01-29)](https://steam/76561199389993401)\nI used to really love Palia, especially because it's free to play and seemed extremely player rich. I enjoyed the game for a few months and even spent quite a bit of cash on it to support the devs, but then things began to get worse over time. Here are my main issues with the game:\n\nThe romance options are great and they have even opened up some new candidates over time per the players requests, but you never actually get to go on an of the dates with any of the characters. They always find some excuse and then you end up running around doing a minor quest to help them out and make them like you more. This happens with every single candidate, and you never really get to do anything out of the usual. It's a little disheartening considering part of the cozy aspect of the game is to date/romance characters. I found it to be extremely disappointing.\n\nThe glitches were something that were always present, but as time went on and promises of fixing them, they only seemed to get worse. More and more bugs cropped up, lots of them being the exact same issue from a previous patch that they swore they fixed. This leads to the game being unplayable, as certain quests and weekly gifts are cooked meals and when an ingredient is glitching or something isn't working, you can't complete it and essentially have to wait for the developers to fix it. Usually, I am very patient about this, but the issue is that the bugs aren't being fixed at all. They claim they are, but never seem to fix anything that is a real problem. This leads me to my biggest gripe about Palia and it is the way that the developers are deciding to handle the criticism of their inconsistencies. When told about triggering seizures due to the glitching, their response was that they were going to fix it asap due to concern for their player base. When they essentially told these players they fixed the issue, and very obviously didn't, they were politely confronted only to get upset and tell players to \"give them the benefit of the doubt\" in spite of their previous promises to actually fix the issue. I find that to be irresponsible, and frankly untrustworthy when they could just be upfront about their struggles to fix visual settings or toggle to turn off the visuals that will cause these seizures.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't say it's a terrible game, but I personally cannot support devs who do not care about their player base and continue to act unprofessional in the face of problems they themselves have created. If I could go back and never put any money into the game, I would in a heartbeat as things are far too expensive for a game that doesn't actively fix bugs and in-game issues that make it unplayable from week to week. I may reconsider in the future if they ever address their poor communication with people in the disabled community and their lack of bug fixes, but otherwise, I have to be upfront about my experience and it wasn't good.",

As much as I wanted to play DDLV, but Disney didn't keep their promise, and didn't make it free to play after release, so I was looking for something free / cheaper to play. This game fulfills that scratch you need. Look, I don't even mind grinding part, I love grinding in most games if it is done right.

While the repetitive nature can set in after a while, the game provides a variety of activities to keep you engaged, from fishing and bug catching to gardening and interior design.\n\nOne divisive aspect is the cooperative harvesting of higher-tier materials. This encourages social interaction and teamwork, adding a refreshing layer to the gameplay. However, solo players might find this mechanic a bit limiting at times.\n\nOverall, Palia is a fun and charming game that delivers on its promise of a cozy and relaxing experience.

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-02-09)](https://steam/76561199084746202)\nThis game isn’t really for solo players looking to just kick back and play on their own — it’s much more rewarding when you have support from friends. There are plenty of items and tasks that require two or more people, so if you’re going it alone, it'll be impossible to progress the main quest after the first few. However, if you’re someone who loves being part of communities, joining Discord servers, and making new friends, this is the game for you! You don't need your current friend group to play it with, there's sooo many discord servers and people wanting to make friends. If you don't necessarily want to make friends, you can still message in server chat your coordinates on the map and someone will come by and help you farm items you can't do alone, or you can request 4 items per day that you need and people will fulfil your request.\n\nIt’s hands down the cosiest, no-combat game I’ve ever played. The quests aren’t overly challenging but still enjoyable, and there’s always something to do, from cute events to decorating and designing your housing plot. Even though I’m usually not a fan of farming games, this one is super fun and easy to get into. You don't have to worry about fall damage, villagers sleeping (even though they sleep you can still go to their door and speak to them!). There's not much you can't do, it's still a grind, not an easy run, but an enjoyable one!\n\nThat being said, there are still a fair number of bugs, like items in buildings sometimes becoming invisible or villagers appearing underground at your plot, which can be a bit annoying. You’ll likely need to restart the game to fix these issues. But it’s still a fairly new game, so I’m sure these bugs will be ironed out over time and don't really take away from the experience as they're quite minor. \n\nOne thing I’d love to see in the future is a shop for different hairstyles to make character customisation a bit more detailed. I’m a big fan of character creation, so more options to customise your avatar would be a great addition!\n\nWhat really stands out, though, is the community. I’ve joined 'cooking parties' in game from Discord, which help level up your cooking skill and earn money in the game super fast. The people are incredibly kind, helpful, and generous. It’s honestly one of the best gaming communities I’ve been a part of. If you’re into making friends and love a chill, cosy vibe, this game will become your new favourite! \n\n*TL;DR*: Great game for those who enjoy teamwork and community! Solo players may struggle past the early quests, but there are plenty of Discord servers to make friends and get help. It’s a cosy, no-combat game with fun quests and relaxing housing design. Some bugs like invisible items and villagers underground exist, but they’re minor and likely to be fixed. A character customisation shop for hairstyles would be a great addition. The community is friendly and helpful, making it perfect for those who love a chill, social vibe!",

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-02-02)](https://steam/76561198294522434)\nA joyous online farming/crafting sim that is relaxing, entertaining, and beautiful. \nKey features:\n1) Co-op. You can choose to travel alone, but it is more worth while with friends. So far the community is supportive and kind.\n2) Story. I have yet to finish the main story, but it has been entertaining.\n3) Characters. Diverse and interesting with their own personalities. Work to befriend them with gifts, daily chats, and quests. Romance available.\n4)Skill growth. The skill growth spans several areas: farming, hunting, mining, crafting, fishing. It keeps you moving and sets reasonable goals.\n5) Farming. The farming sim is reliable and easy, yet with challenges that get easier as you level up your equipment and skill. Plenty of plants to offer, and the upgrades are worth it.\n6) Fishing and bug catching. Easy with it's own challenges. A wide array of fish and bugs that vary depending on location, time, and equipment. You can display star quality ones in your home.\n7) Foraging, hunting, and mining. Similar to other games with a rarity level and the equipment to match. Tools become available to help ease the process, and friends make it easier.\n8) Cooking and crafting. Unlock an array of recipes as well as equipment to keep your focus up (your energy so to speak that impacts the exp earned). Cooking with a group proves more rewarding.\n9) Build your house and share with others. You buy writs and crafter rights at the town hall to expand your home. Set your home in a tour for others to see and view and rate other homes. Doing all of this gains you rewards. The building mechanism is good, but could use improvements. You can buy house expansions from the town hall, and additional buildings. Easily moved. You can purchase recipes for building blocks to build, and these lock together for easy movement. You can grow trees and flowers to place, and, as noted earlier, you can place tanks with bugs and fish! See cons for minor irritants.\n10) Customize your character with clothing, hairstyles, hats, and pets. The character customization is easy and seamless. \n\nPalia is free, though there are in-game purchases you can make to support them.\n\nCons (my personal take):\n1) Probably one of my largest annoyances is the inability to group move many items on your plot. You can work around this by stacking on movable items, but if you want to plant a ton of flowers in grass? You had better want them where they are!\n2) Glitches. Some of the glitches can be annoying and frustrating, but overall they are few and the devs are active in corrections.\n3) Night doesn't get dark enough in my opinion. I know it's silly, but I like the challenge of creating light.\n4) Although I appreciate the no time limit, not resting for energy seems...odd. Almost like cheating.\n5) Interaction with pets. I mean, they are cute, but that's it. Nothing but following you around. I would like to see at the minimum petting interaction! Skills and leveling would be great!\n6) No mounts. But there is a cart system. Yet there is a lot of running around.\n7) No weather changes. I always appreciate this in farming Sims, but also can add additional challenges.\n\nI highly recommend this game, and if you enjoy it ass well as I do, then remember to support the dev team. <3",

It super fun to run around and meet all the interesting characters while following along a fun and intriguing plot. In the meantime while you complete the story you get to build a home base and learn to cook, garden/farm, fish, etc.. So many fun things! You also get to play with people all over the world and everyone is so nice and helpful when you are out getting resources. The creators are very generous and are always working to update the game as well as sending out little free gifts to players. The only time you spend real life money is if you want any special outfits/skins/pets but even those are very reasonable seeing how the game is free and that is how they keep the lights on. If you don’t want to spend money they do give you a free pet and most f the clothing is actually really cute! There are tons of great videos on YouTube as well on how to get started in Palia like the lingo and “unspoken rules” of the game so when I started, I was feeling pretty comfortable but greeted and helped by all the players and even still to this day am.

There are a lot of complaints on the reviews section & in some player forums which made me think that it might be sub standard. I think it is a great game, for those who like animal crossing or medieval dynasty. It has had so much effort and time put in, & the amount of options for decorating are incredible. To the complaints I would only say this- the game is free! I would pay $40- $50 for it (I am used to PlayStation & Nintendo prices). In fact I spent money on skins because I felt so guilty not paying anything for the experience. \r\nWhat I love:\r\nThe number of options for furniture/decorations.\r\nThe number of different plant-ables (flowers).\r\nThe monthly markets.\r\nThe NPC storylines are great (the Subira ones worried me a bit, but they turned out well).\r\nI like that they add new plots & new areas, some of the other games I have played kind of end & having fresh content means I can play for longer.\r\n\r\nWhat I would alter:\r\nI would love to see what is in Tamala's store & have potions.\r\nI like having symmetry in my veggie patch, please add another soil slot, or have say 8 veggie/berry slots & then when you hit higher levels allow 2-4 \"tree only\"soil plots.\r\nI find it weird that the apple tree \"dies\", it would be better that it is planted once on a \"tree only slot\"and then just gives apples every 5-8 days rather than having to keep replanting it.\r\n\r\nWhat I would add:\r\nI would love an extra colour option in the furniture makeovers (something like black/white/wooden look). \r\nI would like some long skirts, there are a lot of short skirts and jeans etc.\r\n\r\nThink it is great, full credit to the devs for this :).",

Every character has a unique and charming personality.\n\n2. No time restraint. I love this feature! I used to stress getting everything done in Stardew Valley but this removes that stress. Don't get me wrong, I love the grind in Stardew but Palia is definitely a lot more laid back.\n\n[h3]PARTY UP![/h3] \n3. Just send a server-wide message and someone will take you up on it. It is so much faster to farm because being in a party allows you access to each other's loot as long as you stay in close proximity of each other. This includes ores, foraging, hunting, etc. You gain money faster which will help you buy the bigger backpack and ammo storage.\n\n4. I love the community and how all players support each other. There is a donation system where each player can ask everyone in the server up to 4 items per day. \n\nThank you devs!!",

The ones you have to grind for and then get the resources to build. Has alot of the systems from those games just with better graphics. Don't expect dungeons or fighting at least right now. \nWith that said it's a good game for people who just want a world to live in where they can do daily mundane tasks. I can see that this game takes inspiration from game mechanics like fable and zelda. Like romance options, climbing rock faces and mysterious lore that can be discovered.",

New content only contains weak additions with the entire focus being on getting more money out of its players.

My dad plays too and he is 85; my daughter of 24 also plays, so it's a game which obviously has something for every age group. \nThe downside is that when there is a new patch, problems arise with things that weren't issues before. Having spent the majority of my working life in software design and production, I would hazard a guess that the software is not written in modules which are untouched once proven to work.

      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-01-24)](https://steam/76561198857633443)\nDespite almost 400 hours in the game, unless you're only here for decorating your plot, the game isn't worth too much of your time. I love the building system, the style of the objects, the grid system, etc. The characters are well written, but dialogue becomes cycled fairly quickly with very little updates to their story-lines/personal development. \r\n\r\nI play on PC, but the graphics for Switch are ATROCIOUS not to mention the bugs!! In my opinion, it's not ready for early access even after almost a year of being playable on steam. Every update breaks the game to the point where it's unplayable.\r\n\r\n There's still quests that are so bugged, you can't get through them without contacting support and yet they keep adding expensive cosmetics to the game. How many $20 dollar outfits does this game need before it fixes core issues? I have no problem with cosmetics, but it's bordering on EA levels of over-monetization for a game that isn't worth the money. The free clothing options are ugly as hell, ad the cosmetics are overpriced. The dwindling player count speaks for itself honestly. I love this game and the little world of Palia but mismanagement and greed ruin it for me. I'll still log in to decorate here and there but I'm not invested like I was when I first started playing and that's unlikely to change.",

I love that humans are considered almost mythical and here your character pops up out of nowhere and the entire community of non humans is so curious about your character. The only thing that's meh about this game is the grind for materials. The crafting is amazing, gathering the materials, especially the more rare ones is tedious, especially when it's a 5:1 or better ratio. Also the interaction/friendship aspect goes a little slowly. It's almost like you can grind the friendships to get them to where you need them for certain quests, or you can grind materials...there doesn't feel like there's a good balance there yet. Overall though, a nice game, good for when you want to get into a game and lose track of time but easily enough to stop where you're at and come back to reality.",

I love these types of games and why I played Disney Dreamland but waiting to meet different villagers and unlock different things gives me a little sour taste. One thing I really enjoy about the game is the character creation however. I will give it a 5/10 just because every outfit is 20+ dollars. An MMORPG like FF, BDO, WoW or anything like I can see since the playerbase is so massive. But for a mainly singleplayer game its a bit much. I get its a new game and the devs are trying to build the community and such which takes a huge amount of money; but to have the most boring clothing and all the nice clothing purchasable is killer to me. Why not make some pieces of clothing craftable or obtainable through certain missions?",

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-01-23)](https://steam/76561199582930680)\nI love this game!!! Id highly recommend this game to others, in fact I have. Character creation is really good, the in game relationship system is a favorite, I love the resource gathering aspect of it, inventory/map/quest log etc are all easy to navigate which is great. I love the different areas you can explore and all the little achievements you can get playing.\r\nFor the things I dislike starting off with 1. Storage. Stacked items take up way more space then I was expecting. Rather then a stack of 20 wood taking 1 spot in your storage chest it is actually taking up 20 of your spots even when stacked/condensed which gets really annoying when you're trying to build up your resources. \r\n2. Crafting items feels super unbalanced in the way that each item requires a ton of resources which is a lot of time gathering, time refining, storage space all for one item. Some crafted items also just feel pointless. For example, you can craft repair kits for your tools when you upgrade them to keep them at max power. Each crafted kit gives you 20 kits which I assumed 1 kit = full tool life. WRONG. If your tool is nearing the end of its upgraded life its going to cost all if not more then your 20 kits to fix which feels insanely unbalanced. Makes \"upgrading\" your tools feel more like a \"downgrade\" and an expensive chore to keep up on.",

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-01-23)](https://steam/76561198045007430)\nStill relatively new to the game with only around 230 hours at the time of this review. The game is still being developed with updates being implemented.\n\nThis game is not designed to rush from the start to end, someone can min/max, stress to hit every event and rush all the time to try and squeeze in every aspect of the game each time it comes around but that was not what it was designed for.  This is a cozy game which is focused on a relaxing game-play. An in-game date is matched to a real world hour.  So if you miss something you can just get it again an hour later.  The day cycles are not designed to be a FOMO, just to allow a variety of events to take place throughout the in-game day such as rotating fish or bugs during select hours as well as NPC's go about their lives and work, socialize and sleep too.  The designer of Palia included that you can still interact with the NPC's even if they are sleeping at time so your never really missing out. \n\nSome peoples comments that they feel that gold becomes the bottleneck to slow down play and that is somewhat true.  It is more difficult in the beginning to earn gold as you are learning the game, improving your tools, expanding your housing plot(s) and more. If you mainly want to just unlock things you can focus on the main quest line. If your not in a rush however there are side quests, discoverables, story lines that expand the games lore and flushes out the NPCs. Just about any game has progression to keep the game moving and interesting.  This is a free game with the option to purchase cosmetics if you opt to do so but it is by no means required. In general the community has been positive, helpful and considerate to events working as groups.  The game rewards playing together but does not takeaway from playing solo if you have a preference game play style.",

I'm nowhere near done with the main story, and apparently only the Prologue has been completed thus far?? All the money I spent on Disney Dreamlight Valley should have gone to this one. I actually feel enthusiastic about supporting this game, financially, as I really want the development to continue. As an unmotivated ADHDer, Palia makes me passionate about video games again.",

The game offers a welcoming, positive community where players are genuinely helpful and supportive. I believe the developers' main goal is to create a space where creativity can thrive and players can collaborate freely.\r\n\r\nI absolutely love the game's depth. From building your own house to farming, cooking, and crafting, every activity contributes to your skill progression. There's so much to explore and enjoy that it's hard to know where to begin!\r\n\r\nThat being said, the game isn’t perfect. My only criticism is the chat function, which tends to bug me out of the game from time to time. Additionally, the Mujins look a bit off when you're cutting down trees, but these small issues don't detract from the overall enjoyment of the game.\r\n\r\nPalia is a charming and immersive experience that stands out in a crowded genre.

Super simple. \r\nHowever, with the overly added popups of \"information\" it literally tells you nothing of what to do. How do I get I fabric or leather? How do I get back to my quest marker that's no longer there because I reached the place but had to go back for something? Why can I not fast travel to places I've already been? Why the eff do I need to arc my arrow to shoot something literally 5 feet in front of me? \r\nI really did not enjoy this game. It annoyed and frustrated me more than anything. As someone who greatly enjoys fishing, farming and the such, this game was honestly a waste of my time.",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-01-17)](https://steam/76561198869530888)\nIts a free to play cozy game that still has adventure, while you don't go killing monsters (not that I would mind killing monsters) there are still challenges, quests, and adventures. Palia is in a category of its own. You can design your own house and decorate how you want in whatever style you choose. You can make food, farm, hunt, fish, and even friend and date npcs. I was never interested in stardew valley or animal crossing. I don't really play cozy games but I must say Palia is a vibe. \r\n\r\nThat being said while I do like the game and its lore a lot I do not like the co-op aspect in that you are required to work with others for certain resources. Its hard for me to talk to others one on one and/or ask for help when most people don't even talk in chat, just because someone is helpful doesn't mean they want to be friends. Don't get me wrong some talk and seem friendly and if you ask a question you're likely to receive an answer but I also feel like I'm on someone else's time when in a group unless I know the people well. I don't want to rush because someone is waiting and I don't want to make others feel rushed because I'm waiting. And some days its just hard to ask for help. It's not that I'm anti social you'll see me talk in chat its more that I'm awkward social and don't want to feel forced to make friends.\r\n\r\nThere's unique crafting in the game as well but I wish used items you no longer want had a better use than to just be tossed, maybe like a revert system, even if you lose some materials, or a lower sell price, auctioning even. \r\n\r\nAlso, it would be neat if you could design or even craft cosmetics or outfits though I'm not sure that's a thing. (Still learning things) You can change your look and beginner outfit for free and as often as you want but there's nothing else unless you buy it which I get, they gotta make money to run the game somehow, but I wouldn't mind a few pieces of craftable clothing and cosmetics here and there. I feel like I don't have a personality because there's nothing on my person that's unique lol\r\n\r\nAll in all very good game would recommend 8/10. (Yes I got it for free but it is free at least for now.)",

Some days you want something to play where you know you can relax and nothing's going to try to kill you. It's fun doing the friendship/dating quests. I like that there are secrets to unravel, plenty of things to craft and collect. Decorating your home is fun. The game's genuinely free, they don't bug you to buy stuff all the time but I ended up buying a few cosmetic things just because I love the game so much and wanted to support them. I see plenty of ways the game could improve but it gets a lot right and I look forward to what they do in the future.",

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-01-16)](https://steam/76561199151409615)\nPalia is a charming life sim with a lot of potential. The world is visually stunning, and the character customization options are extensive. I've enjoyed exploring the different areas, completing quests, and interacting with the friendly villagers.\r\n\r\nOne of the highlights is the in-depth decorating system. Players have a lot of freedom to customize their homes with a wide variety of furniture, decorations, and even landscaping options. This allows for a high level of creativity and personalization.\r\n\r\nHowever, some aspects of the game can be frustrating. Collecting certain plushies, particularly the rare fish and hunting ones, can be quite challenging and time-consuming. The drop rates for these items seem low, which can be discouraging.\r\n\r\nOverall, Palia is a promising game with a lot to offer. The charming world, engaging characters, and extensive customization options make it a relaxing and enjoyable experience. However, some aspects, like the difficulty of obtaining certain collectibles, could be improved.\r\n\r\nKey Strengths:\r\n\r\nBeautiful visuals and a charming world.\r\nExtensive character customization options.\r\nEngaging decorating system with a wide range of furniture and decor.\r\nFriendly and engaging NPCs.\r\nAreas for Improvement:\r\n\r\nDifficulty of obtaining certain plushies, particularly fish and hunting ones.\r\nSome aspects of the game can feel repetitive.\r\nOverall:\r\n\r\nPalia is a fun and relaxing life sim with a lot of potential.

The community online are always so helpful and the mini game's are fun and easy to pass time with in between long waits. The romance options are fun, wish they were a little more in depth personally but I'm 100% a critic on that front, so disregard that bias. Without a doubt worth looking into and downloading. I can only explain this game like the following; if Animal Crossing met Stardew Valley, then had a child and that child met Legend of Zelda and had a child. This is that second child. I've spent 145 hours in this game as of when im writing this review. I expect to have more.",

I LOVE how different it is from anything else I’ve played. It’s open-ended, relaxing, and somehow still packed with so much to do! The quality is insanely good, the art style is beautiful, and the gameplay is just perfect. It’s one of those games that pulls you in, and before you know it, hours have passed.\r\n\r\nThere are so many quests, and I love how every skill, whether it’s hunting, fishing, cooking, or foraging—feels meaningful. Upgrading your tools and progressing takes time, but that just makes everything feel so rewarding. And the decorating?? Don’t even get me started! There are SO many options, and I could literally spend hours just making my home look cute.\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite parts is the party system because you actually grow and level up together. Playing with friends makes everything even more fun, and it feels like you're always working toward something. It’s just such a cozy, immersive world that I never get tired of.\r\n\r\nAlso, I HAVE to mention the cosmetics, yes, they’re expensive, but honestly?? They are SO pretty and beautifully designed that I don’t even mind spending my money on them. Every outfit and accessory looks amazing, and I already know I’m going to be buying way too many! \r\n\r\nThe Palia community! Calling them nice and welcoming is AN UNDERSTATEMENT!!! They are sooo nice, always helpful, and just make the game even better.\r\n\r\nIf you love games that let you explore, chill, and customize every little thing, Palia is 100% for you. Even in beta, it’s already amazing, and I can’t wait to see how it evolves. Easily one of my favorite games right now! ❤️\r\n\r\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 10/10",

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-01-15)](https://steam/76561198802528444)\nI recommend the game in the sense there is content, things to do and it seems fleshed out. It's your typical farming simulation RPG. I partially don't like it though because there is no PVE combat(I personally hate PVP). If there were some PVE combat, similar to what Stardew Valley has, then I would give this game 10/5 and 1000/100! At least an optional \"dungeon\" or cave instance that you don't NEED to complete but you *can* complete for some extra stuff would suffice. That way players can choose to do it. So for those who just want the farming sim, they can still have that without combat. Then for those who like to play it all, farming AND combat(PVE not PVP), an instance or cave with some monsters you can kill with a bow or sword would be an excellent(and welcome) addition to the game. Probably would sell more copies too! Especially since there is some talk about forging weapons by NPCs, why not have some PVE action in there too?\r\n\r\n I got this game thinking there was some sort of combat. Like a 3D Stardew Valley and I was so excited. Then I saw a comment about how there is no PVE combat and I immediately lost interest. At least make it an optional feature. Id like to refund the game otherwise, please.",

I liked the characters, the quests were fun and the town and world is really immersive and interesting. I thought that it was a really charming game, and that it would rot my brain for the next 100 hours but then my axe broke. \n\nI expected that it would simply not work, since I had gone through the necessary steps to upgrade it.. But I had to reupgrade it and it downgraded. People have mentioned that having to grind out resources is a problem.. It is. Having to find and grind out the individual ores is a CHORE, and maybe it's better with the community, but I shouldn't have to struggle because I like playing and doing things on my own. \n\nAfter 27 hours and my axe broke I was so annoyed that I had to gather all of my things, re-smelt them (which isn't instant.. it takes time like a mobile game would) and then i could go toward that next upgrade I was working on. It's annoying that there's no automated resource gathering for things you've already gotten and it's frustrating and punishing.

The graphics are great, the gameplay feels smooth and enjoyable, the soundtrack and atmosphere are top notch, the story is super immersive and the characters all have deep personalities and their own stories to explore. Everything in this game is done perfectly, it's just an amazing and very emotional experience, that you can enjoy along with a great, kind and very active community.\nYet, after not even 60 hours of slow gameplay, i finished the main questline, all the active side questlines and all the character questlines that interested me.

I started grinding fishing and bug catching for the night sky temple, which was much tougher than other quests but still really fun, and did some tiny quests that appeared along the way. Yet, after a while i just realised that i'm chasing something that's not there. The game was super enjoyable, fun and immersive but after finishing the main questline which turned out to be much shorter than i expected and i REALLY took my time completing it, the game turned to me searching for something to do cause i was too attached to the experience.\nTechnically in game it says that this is still a beta, but the steam store page showing it as a full experience is just misleading. Even though the only microstransactions are purely cosmetic, i still imagine that someone who payed for some cosmetics after seeing how great the game feels would be disappointed after realising that the game feels more like a demo than a finished, long term mmo experience.\nIt would be an amazing game that i would spend my money on, if it had at least 20x more content.\nAt this state, it's still worth playing because it's free, but prepare to be disappointed.\nI love this game and it pains me to say it, but it's not worth getting into cause all you're gonna end up with is a bitter aftertaste and a thirst for something that was never there.",

You have only two ways of earning money basically and all you do is grinding same things all the time. For some things you even have to count on other players if they help you out or not. But not only that disappointed me. I was really looking forward to winter time in Palia because i just love winter seasons in games and i thought i will see pretty view of snow and decorations everywhere. But that didn't happen.

Gathering is rather on meh side , animations are just terrible . For certain amount of time you can play by your self and then you need other players to gather end game materials ( which is extremely stupid design ) . Story is fun for about 1st 5-6 quests and it becomes bland . More efforts went to cash shop the to the game as there is so many minor bugs which could have been fixed anytime but no , devs keep adding more packs of cosmetic junk to cash grabbing shop then actually doing anything for the game . After a while game becomes very repetitive , boring , as there is not much to do , all there is to tend to your crops and keep gathering materials and thats that for entire game . oh and as you get higher tier tools , it feels like their made out of paper as you need to fix them every 2 min .",

Yesterday alone, I had to have restarted a solid 4-5 times. This is worse on the Switch (do yourselves a favor and wait till a stable release if you want to get it for switch). \r\n\r\nWhen designing me character, I could not find a decent haircut for males. They all look so feminine and extremely...... yeah, (IYKYK) I mean, they use body type A and B so this isn't really a surprise. \r\n\r\nThe whole friendship thing into romance thing is just slow. You climb friendship slowly, and is timegated. It looks liked they took a page from Blizzard. \r\n\r\nBiggest thing I think it's missing is a collections page. Seeing what fish you've caught, what bugs you caught, crops harvested, and so on. \r\n\r\nThe rubberbanding makes me think I'm plating LoL for the first time when it released. \r\n\r\nBut, I will give credit where credits due. If they remove the Type A - B body types, and added some additional hairstyles that suit the male body frame, thats a bonus (and something that gamers want). \r\nThe biggest thing that needs to be looked into is the game breaking tool bugs the most though. Easily replicated, and if they wanted to hit me up with the steps to replicate it, happy to supply (I legit could not find a bug report form). \r\nThe graphics as a whole are cute, but a lot do look ripped right from Fortnite (environments and housing), not going to complain about that, I do personally like that design. \r\n\r\nAs soon as they fix the game breaking bugs, Ill swap to a hell yes recommendation.",

The game's blend of crafting, cooking, and farming is a joy to experience, and the ability to share these activities with friends adds a layer of warmth and community that's hard to find in many games. The developers have clearly put a lot of love into creating a world that feels alive and inviting, with each character and location having its own unique charm.\n\nWhile the game is still in its early stages, the potential is immense. The developers have shown a willingness to listen to the community and make meaningful changes, which is a breath of fresh air in the gaming industry. The graphics are stunning, and the attention to detail in the world design is impressive. The game's focus on exploration and discovery is a highlight, with each new area offering something new to see and do.\n\nHowever, there are areas where Palia could improve. The game's progression system can feel a bit grindy at times, and the lack of a robust multiplayer experience can be a letdown for those looking for a more social gameplay experience. The premium store, while not intrusive, could be better balanced to ensure that players feel rewarded for their time and effort, rather than just their wallet.\n\nDespite these minor drawbacks, Palia is a game that I find myself returning to time and time again. It's a perfect blend of relaxation and challenge, and the sense of community is something that's truly special. I'm excited to see where the game goes from here, and I have no doubt that with continued support and development, Palia will become a staple in the cozy gaming genre.",

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-02-02)](https://steam/76561199672618112)\nThis game is a fun game, there is lots to do that keep you busy so you don't get bored. Quests eventually run out. I can't wait for more. However, you can work on leveling up your skills and decorating your home. Helping others complete their quests, join communities, have hunting, cooking, bug catching parties. \r\n\r\nCons: The game does crash quite often. Lags more than I care for. You get stuck in conversation with the characters and have to restart your game. You will have glitches with joining parties with friends where you have to restart the game to be able to see each other's green dot on the map or that you are in a party together. Your equipment will fail to work sometimes and you will have to jump and pull out your glider to get it to work again. If that doesn't work, you will have to restart the game.\r\n\r\nGood Luck!",

If they would only charge for it they could at least afford servers to run the amount of players at any point. The game is so fun but the second you get into it it will lag/freeze/disconnect you, its BEYOND frustrating. I love this game, there's few things I would change except adding more decorations, rugs and plants but that's just me being picky at that point. Please please please buy more server space, it just makes you not want to play.",

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-01-29)](https://steam/76561198053387739)\nI do recommend this game. Sometimes when small companies make a game and it hits big, they tend not to hear the voice of their fans. They now have money and why should they? But so far this company and game has still kept in touch with its fan base. That hits HUGE with me. It makes such a difference for investing in the game. If you dont matter to the game then its easy to move on, though sad game companies chose that path. \r\n\r\nI am someone who likes tasks and achievments and things to do. I also value and need a good community. If the chat is toxic Im out and un-installing fast. Life is to crazy atm to spend time in a game that brings you anything but joy. So for this game you can go achievments and hunting and plushies. Or you can spend time building your home and playing hot pot games, or even better you can do all that. Their are no time limits as we palians say its easier to be kind then not. Their are also tons of videos you can watch before choosing this game to make sure its right for you. I am mostly a solo player but their are tons of palians who will group up with you quickly. We received this growable furniture that was from shared party xp. I groaned, \"oh no i have to find a group\"...but it went wonderful actually. We all grouped up and made sure people had parties so they could get their furniture too. It was a nice way of doing things here and there. so watch some videos and then decide. But for me, I recommend it and it is nice and casual and relaxing.",

I love being able to hunt, mine, chop, forage, cook, and garden to my hearts content, and enlist the help of my friends along the way. Building friendships with the NPC's, the quests, the gifts, they are a tried and true system. I love the freedom this game gives me. Not even to mention how absolutely beautiful the game is.

The quests for discovery of who you are as a human in this world of Palians play like a solo dungeon crawl full of clues and puzzles to unfold a bigger sense of the world. If you enjoy the grind of farming and gathering, you can spend an entire game play session doing just that and never get bored! Or if you'd rather interact in a more meaningful way, you can build relationships with all the Palians who each have their own unique story and personality. They also unlock quests and challenges as you continue to get to know them, which feeds into your greater knowledge of the world outside the boundaries of Kilima!

And those patches come around sooner than we realise (every 1 month theres usually something new). \n\nGraphics are nice and a lot of the times I use the camera mode to take ingame photos. Hunting is a lot of fun, there can be a few bugs at times regarding shots or glitchy animals, but usually its pretty smooth. Mining and bug catching are my favourite, (anyone that see's my ingame plot will know that) as its simple but also makes good Palian moneys. The players, especially the regulars, are amazing and friendly and because of that I've made many new friends because of Palia. \n\nPalia still has so much potential to grow, and with the new Elderwoods update soon to come, we all are hoping they will nail it.

But!..\r\n\r\nYou have good graphics (for an M(?)MObasebuilder indie project), you have good NPC's, with not too deep, but well-written stories. \r\n\r\nBut mainly - the gameplay and mechanics. \r\n\r\nImagine, you play, let's say, Hogwarts Legacy. And you have gameplay about making potions. Well, \"have\" is a too big of a word. You bring ingredients to cauldron, press a button, then running around like a fool for a minute. Not ten minutes, that will allow you to do something while its bubblin'. Not instantly. A minute. Of nothing to do.\r\n\r\nAnd here you have Palia, where to cook something - you need a few different stations, in multiple quantities, and you need to PLAY at each of these. I won't say that it is helluva minigame, but it is interactive, and its fun. And its better than Hogwarts Legacy, a AAA game in Wizardring(may be misspelled) world universe.\r\n\r\nAnd you can sense that in all of game contents. Its made with passion and devs think about their players, IMO.\r\n\r\nOh, and the community. Well done, Singularity 6.\r\n\r\nA con for that would be that it is HARD to create male character that is not looking like total gay. Don't get me wrong here, I don't mind that, and I can understand from where this is going, but I want to have a choice. Yes, female char is a choice, I know.",

With that said, I cannot recommend the game, every update feels like it's another push to being a cashgrab, with them now even introducing a monthly sub style - kind of similar to how gacha games have this monthly sub where, when you log in daily, get some currency. Might be worth if you feel like wanting to buy all the cosmetics but honestly, it's so pointless. Instead of making the game more stable - everytime I play I have to restart the game atleast once because something get's bugged - they just push the premium shop more. After you've finished what is similar to bundles in stardew valley, there is not much to do besides grinding for materials to craft furniture to decorate. I do like how decorating works in this game, you can clutter up everything which is quite fun, but that's about it. Multiplayer is kind of a joke aswell, wish that you could own a plot of land with a friend for example and work on it together. So no, while I will probably continue playing on and off, wouldn't recommend to new players.",

There are alot of what seems like pointless and purposeful inconvenience features, you'd find in many mmo's like wow for example, but without a way to buy your way into convenience which i wouldn't want either but it just seems like they are pointless, for example the most obvious one, is the 30min time limit before you can go to your map and click on the return home button, most of the game i've simply just closed it or simply waited instead of doing anything because i wanted to do a specific thing, like go into ruins which require a glider to get to, so i grind for the glider but there are several progression locks and other things preventing me from doing so, i achieve this after a while and am completely underwhelmed and was when i reached the ruins just now not interested because the fun of discovering the game was killed by the meaningless time i spent doing meaningless things. i wouldn't usually be so annoyed but i did want to enjoy this and i do like the aesthetic. however i just can't reccomend this when the time sucking features within this game ruin even wanting to entertain learning about any sort of lore or story happening, when i started the game i actually enjoyed the characters now i couldn't care less because their dialouge boxes is just another thing taking time away from doing other things. /: and i really really like my home, but im not sure if i have the motivation to return. although i most likely will.. because i still haven't finished decorating it.",

      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-01-25)](https://steam/76561198111767169)\nPalia is cute, and actually cozy like it states. So if you like games like that, then i'd recommend it but please keep in mind the massive issues that hide behind the tags of being \"Cozy\". Side note, this game IS IN OPEN BETA. It is NOT full release yet like they like to lead you to believe, and have BANNED people from the Official Discord for pointing it out. Now lets get into it.\n\nPros:\n- Cozy\n- Cute environment\n- Great for mindless gaming and hanging out with friends\n- Cute Concept\n\nCons:\n- Terrible execution\n- Money hungry leads (they had 50 million to do this project and lost most of it from over-hiring and poor monetization)\n- As said above; Poor monetization\n- Premium shop gets more releases every monthly patch than ACTUAL CONTENT. 15-20USD to buy a PET and around 30-70 for the outfits, some of them having special VFX that do nothing in-game other than idle animations\n- Ported over to Nintendo Switch BEFORE it was even stable on PC\n- Leadership has said they're very much uninterested in listening to any sort of positive / constructive feedback from the community.\n- VFX issues that FLASH and HAS given people seizures. \n\nThere's more but i have a limit here. so ill leave it off with a couple of Con posts from past Singularity 6 Devs:\n\n\"The Leadership does not actually listen to people. They smile and nod while people talk, but then don't act on the things people say; they just explain why the thing they decided is what we're doing. Tragically, they probably think that they are listening, but they're not. They're hearing, but they're not listening. When people say things that they don't want to hear, they ignore it. This is both internally and externally. There is almost no insight into why new players try Palia and stop playing. They instead focus on what the most die-hard players like.\"\n\n\"The leadership of S6 truly drove Palia into the ground. It breaks my heart that a project where 200 folks poured themselves into it, got ruined by poor decision making made by a handful of people. They hired massively talented people, truly the best in the industry. Just to ignore their wisdom and experience.\"\n\nThanks for reading if you did. \n\nEdit: i have 188 hours on Steam, and probably another 500 on the standalone launcher before steam release and have spent most of that time in the Discord.",

Quests are mostly fun to do and there is all sorts of things here. Gardening, mining, tree chopping, exploring, fishing.  You can talk to NPC´s and befriend them, which opens new quests. Downside of the game: Grinding and only able to give q present per week to NPC´s so leveling up friends bar is taking a long time.\r\nOverall i would give it 8/10.",

I love playing this because I like the many different fish you can catch, the many meals you can prepare, and the furniture you can make.  Most of the star items you are able to display on your plot too. You get to create your own home on your plot of land too! \r\nThe people playing the game are very helpful and kind (this is unusual for games like this in my experience).\r\nThe graphics are great and you have the ability to change your character's appearance any time you want to. The story line is neat too.\r\nOne of the things I would like to see changed is the ability to gift star items to players requesting the item as well as the base item.\r\nI highly recommend this game.",

      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-01-25)](https://steam/76561198955053940)\nI'm just here for the gamer girls, for real.  If you loved Stardew Valley then you are in for a treat.  I passed this game up when I saw a review saying there were too many in game purchases you have to make, but that is simply inaccurate.  The only purchases you make are simply cosmetic for new clothes, virtual pets, and landscapes to build your home on.  You can play this game for free no problem if you don't mind running around in basic wally world clothes.  I also read a review that said they felt the MMO aspect of the game was tacked on, and I disagree.  This game is way more fun to play with other people and you can find plenty of Palia groups on discord that will help you do that.  The community of players is super chill and helpful, and I can't say enough good things about them.  It's really the community that makes me want to continue to keep playing.  I feel like the writing is pretty solid and some of the characters have some real depth to them.  The game is still in beta, and while there are some bugs, I haven't experienced anything that has made me have to stop playing the game; all you have to do is take a moment to hit a loading screen and switch servers and the bug will go away.  I'm excited that the makers are adding new content and a whole new map is set to be released in early 2025.  I would say you can expect to get 250 hours out of this game before you've unlocked all the major upgrades, and some people continue to play the game even after a full year.  If you want this game to have longevity, you'll really have to enjoy the decorating / home building aspect as well as collecting the in game plushies.  Good games make me want to start playing as soon as I wake up in the morning, but this game exceeded that and made me want to stay up all night.",
      "# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-01-19)](https://steam/76561198441064505)\nOh my goodness, stepping into Palia feels like slipping into your coziest pair of pajamas after a long day! This game is the epitome of adorable with its vibrant landscapes and charming characters that make you want to befriend every single one of them.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment you start you are welcomed into a world where you can craft your own little slice of paradise. Whether you're planting flowers catching bugs or just chilling by the riverside with your new pals everything in Palia is done with such a gentle soothing vibe.\r\n\r\nThe character customization is a bit lacky because of the paywall of outfits but if you can you should support and buy one outfit. I mean who wouldnt want to dress up their avatar in the cutest outfit while theyre out gathering resources or cooking up a storm? And speaking of cooking its not just about making food but also its about sharing moments with your in-game buddies just like a real-life potluck but with magical ingredients!\r\n\r\nOne of the best and sweetest parts of Palia is its community. The game encourages teamwork without any pressure making it the perfect place for those who love cooperative play but arent into the competitive scene. You can work together to build explore or unravel the mysteries that hide beneath the surface of this enchanting world.\r\n\r\nThe visuals are just heart-meltingly beautiful. With its soft pastel palette and whimsical designs every corner of Palia looks like its been painted with love. The music adds to this cozy ambiance making every little activity feel like a warm hug.\r\n\r\nAnd lets talk about that storyline - full of mysteries and lore that gently unfolds as you play. Its like being part of a bedtime story that you never want to end!\r\n\r\nIn essence Palia isnt just a game but its a getaway to a place where every day is a new opportunity to find joy in the simplest of activities. If you are looking for a game to unwind with to make friends and to indulge in some delightful escapism Palia is your new cozy home. Totally recommend diving into Palia for a heartwarming adventure, chill and cozy gameplay and sweetest community!",

There are a few Palia trackers avail to help you keep track of daily, weekly, and quest tasks. You can play together with upto 3 of your friends and everyone in the party gets drops while working together to hunt, farm etc... even cooking.  Flow trees need more than one person to chop down, so working together as a community to clear groves becomes a fun part of the game.  You can also hunt magical Sernuk,  Muujin, and Choppa together and everyone get the loot.  You will spend hours on this game, so grab a drink and snack.

Im sorry its a bit ridiculous. Id love to play this game more because you can decorate your home and expand and can romance villagers, but the running around for 30 minutes trying to navigate this huge map is too much of a chore without any spawns/waystones, So I really tried but i wont be playing until theres waystones implemented of some kind, and that timer on your home teleport is AT LEAST lessened because 20 min is way too much. \nalso it says its multiplayer, but theres literally nothing to do with other players, they just run around the map, idk if the team will add some kind of multiplay or co-farm but if they removed multiplayer thered be absolutely NO difference or change, kinda dissapointing since i wanted to play with my friend.\n\nOther than all of that, this game has a lot of potential and i def recommend for a free game, but i warn you you will be running around more than half the time.",

I have sunk quite a few hours into it now and I am still uncovering new quests and mechanics I didn't know about. Here are my favourite things about Palia.\n\n- The amount of decoration options you have for your home plot is amazing. It's also incredibly easy. You grow trees and flowers for the plot and create beautiful pieces of furniture.\n- The grind for items is real. You will spend ages fishing, chopping trees and mining rocks but for me it didn't feel that bad. Maybe it is different for others but I had fun!\n- The store is surprisingly cheap, not more than the average big Fortnite skin, and for a free game it makes sense too. The outfits and gliders are cute.\n- The story and NPC's are amazing! It's so interesting to be the human in this new world after the age of humans. I can't wait to see where the story goes from here. The villagers as well are adorable and all have their own personalities. I am partial to Jina and Hodari.\n- The map is gorgeous! The art style and designs of locations and buildings are amazing. I can't count the number of times I just stood in a flared grove watching the pink dust fly into the sky.\n- Mechanics are so amazing here. The flared trees and fishing is so fun. I love fishing for once. I own enjoy fishing in this game and Far Cry 5!\n- Progression is wonderful. You unlock dialogue with certain NPC's and join associated clubs when you reach level 10, gaining new tools, recipes and other fun items to help you along.\n- With the tools given to us, the community is so wonderful! Everyone is so nice and the gifting system makes it good fun to help others.\n\nFew cons\n- Customisation options are lacking a little bit but I'm not too fussed.\n- The RNG from fishing and bugs is a bit too hard for me. After fishing for 4 real life days I still don't have the fish I want.\n\nBar that it's perfect! The game is wonderful and I can't wait for it continue. The devs are doing a great job and I urge you to play it and if you enjoy it drop a few coins on the cute outfits and pets you can buy through the premium shop!",

I participated in its alpha phase and spent additional time playing directly through the client before it became available on Steam.\n\nI was initially drawn to Palia because it was pitched as the ultimate cozy farming/life sim game... combining all the elements I love in an MMO setting. It felt like a dream game in theory. However, that initial promise has shifted dramatically.... the game no longer even markets itself as an MMO (It did in development phase. There's 25 ppl per instance). \n\nWhile updates have been announced periodically, they often feel like a letdown for me. It seems the focus is mostly on paid premium content like outfits, pets, and tool skins. While those cosmetic options are nice, what the game really needs is GOOD engaging content.\n\nThe housing and decorating system is the highlight of Palia for me. Compared to other cozy games, it stands out for its creativity and flexibility, allowing for freeform building if you have imaginative ideas. Unfortunately, the rest of the content feels too repetitive and boring. Hunting, for example, involves just two animals. Earning money can be frustratingly slow, especially for players who don’t have a lot of time to invest into the game.\n\nHere are some suggestions for improvement:\n\n-Introduce ranching and the ability to gather ingredients like eggs, milk, and butter yourself instead of relying solely on the shop\n-More open world animals (even if not solely for hunting)\n-Add events and cute cutscenes with romance partners to make relationships more interesting\n-Create more open world activities and events that would encourage players to gather for fun, meaningful rewards\n\nThere’s more that could be done, but this is already getting too long. If you enjoy the game as it is, that’s great! However, for me, Palia feels like it has a lot of untapped potential. While I’ll hop on occasionally, it doesn’t hook me the way other farming and life sim games do.\n\nI don't recommend for the long term, but you can try it out for yourself.",
      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-01-17)](https://steam/76561198307580816)\nThe general atmosphere of Palia is quite inoffensive, with clean visuals and gameplay. However, the experience is locked behind real time paywalls from grinding for resources and spending hours running around the world to waiting hours and days of actual time for things to happen in game. They claim to promote a social environment, and then have the servers be multilingual. You cannot socialize effectively with players who do not speak the same language. The NPC's are not interesting to talk to. I don't think this is a bad game per se, and since most of the issues are game design related all of them could be fixed easily, but as it stands I cannot recommend sinking time and energy into this.",

Unfortunately they prioritise cash shop items. There are many many bugs. From simple texture issues and Non functioning game mechanics to complete game crashes and log in failures.\n\nWhile the updates come with minor bugs fixes they don't address a large number and introduce way more than they fix.\n\nThis game is in Beta but it's late into Beta and has become completely unplayable for many. If it makes it to full release I may try again and adjust my review. However based on the companies priorities I doubt it will get a full release.",

      "# Thumbs Down [(Anonymous, Steam, 2025-01-27)](https://steam/76561197995186207)\nDecent game, ok graphics. They want to 'protect' the playerbase so much there is no way to do a direct tell. And you can only group with someone if they are right in front of you.\r\n\r\nThe events are 100% CRAP. You only have limited time to get the rewards. In chappa chase you have to get 25 in one event. I have yet to see anyone get it. There are only a total of about 100 to get in the time limit with 10-20 people chasing them. There is a card game where you compete against 3 other people, yet you need to get 10 wins. The event runs for 1 week and there are only 12 times a day the event is active. Then you will have to wait for ANOTHER YEAR to try to get them again. Except for the limited time ones, which you will never be able to get\r\n\r\nYou have to group for things like chopping flow trees, yet you have to compete i AGAINST people to get the few no $$$$ real money items. Pure 100% crap",

Despite repeated feedback from the community, it seems like no serious effort has been made to address these issues or improve the gameplay experience.\n\nInstead, the focus appears to have shifted almost entirely to releasing new cosmetic outfits for real-money purchases. While I understand the need for monetization, it feels frustrating to see so much attention placed on paid content while long-standing problems remain unaddressed.\n\nIt’s disheartening to see a game with so much potential stall in its development.

The problem with Palia lies with priorities. Many systems are unrealized and unpolished compared to other games like it (from much smaller studios) yet the cash shop is already up an functioning. It also begs the question, what are their motivations for doing things the way they do them? Is making the game online in itself done just to sell more cosmetics? Are they going to forgo a more interactive pet system in lieu of one where they can sell cosmetic only pets?  \n\n \\- In a game with such few systems cosmetics play a much larger role in motivating a player.

It had far fewer features than it has now.  It didn't have several of the systems it has now.  It had far fewer game modes.  In fact, it spent years in beta.\n\nI get the concerns over lack of content in Palia.  I even get concerns about cosmetics costing more than people want to pay (let's face it... any price over $0 is going to be more than some people want to pay.)  But it must be remembered this is a recently-opened live service game that's in beta and shouldn't be critiqued as if it's a complete game.  Even the fully-launched Fortnite continues to evolve, and I'm certain Palia will as long as it is profitable enough to keep it going.    And if it's not profitable, then like hundreds of live service games before it, then it'll close shop as so many F2P games have done before.\n\nIt's understandable that some might not like the direction of that evolution - and it's fair to critique that - but I'm just saying the expectations for a beta should be far lower.\n\n### Comment ID jwgxycg with +2 score by [(MeVe90, Reddit, 2023-08-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwgxycg/) (in reply to ID jwg4lqm):\nI'm surprised they didn't launch a battle pass yet\n\n## Comment ID jwik56a with +5 score by [(Eggsysmistress, Reddit, 2023-08-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwik56a/) (in reply to ID 15ss9gg):\ni thought they were an indie studio at first and was like “aww what a cute game. i’m sure they’ll work hard to make it better”. \n\npfft.\n\n## Comment ID jwjkx17 with +4 score by [(magvadis, Reddit, 2023-08-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwjkx17/) (in reply to ID 15ss9gg):\nIndie has to due with being owned by a major game company. \n\nOne 50 million dollar game does not make you major...at all.\n\n### Comment ID jwjlwc7 with +2 score by [(PsyTripper, Reddit, 2023-08-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/jwjlwc7/) (in reply to ID jwjkx17):\nThanks for clearing that up.

Taking away that feature would’ve lost them a ton of players as deeds(the activity that earns the store currency) are a very popular thing for many veteran players to work on once they’ve completed the current end game raids and dungeons. Essentially, the MMO saying “the true end game is fashion” is very much based in reality for LOTRO. The feature has basically been grandfathered in throughout the various acquisitions LOTRO has gone through over the years. (source: I’ve been playing LOTRO off and on for over a decade)\n\nPalia, however, is still very new and, as a result, very malleable. I’m trying to remain optimistic, but I won’t be surprised if this acquisition means big changes for Palia and its monetization. Ultimately, though, if it means the game will make it to 1.0 while retaining its heart and soul, I’ll be ecstatic.

I have seen some games under the Daybreak banner flourish and others fail.\n\nIn the official statement released it does say that S6 and the game development will still stay under the current leadership.  This  lends hope that maybe Palia will have some luck similar to LotRO where Daybreak is more of a \"publisher\" than a developer.  \n\nWill we see more monetization?  Of course.  A game has to have a revenue stream somehow to continue support and development.  This would have been coming regardless of the Daybreak acquisition or not.  And if they didn't, then our favorite world would eventually die out.\n\nAll we can do at this point is just wait and see.  Me personally, I'll continue to play just how I've been playing and watch what changes.  If it starts to change for the better, GREAT!  If it starts to go downhill, then I'll just start looking for a new home.\n\n## Comment ID lb9zaxp with +9 score by [(mistar_z, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb9zaxp/) (in reply to ID 1dt7ujt):\nI'm concerned for the employees. I knew that when they did all those big layoffs earlier this year it meant that they're probably planning for a sale or acquisition, to look better on paper .

There’s always more layoffs on the horizon. They change the company culture.

I wouldn’t be surprised if they stayed pushing ads for in game purchases and went in a different direction with art eventually. \n\nWe can’t forget that S6 is a for-profit company.

I love Palia, and I love what the studio has tried to do with their monetization model, but let’s be honest: it’s not working. If they were making plenty off of people buying the clothing and just wanting to support the company, there wouldn’t have been layoffs. It sucks, but there’s a reason MMOs don’t follow this monetization model, and it’s not JUST corporate greed. I’d honestly prefer to see this than the alternative, where the game just shuts down entirely and everyone who worked on it is out of a job.\n\n### Comment ID lbbfzp5 with +8 score by [(marchviolet, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lbbfzp5/) (in reply to ID lbb2of8):\nI agree.

Daybreak, formerly known as Sony Online Entertainment, launched EverQuest in 1999 and the game is still going. BUT, it has a ton of paid expansion as well as a monthly subscription you NEED to buy in order to be able to play the game, sort of like World of Warcraft.\n\nI kinda see them going for the same model for Palia but i desperately hope they won't. I'd love to have more things i CAN buy but not things i NEED to buy in order for the game to be fun.\n\nIn terms of game longevity i think this is a good move, there are many old games from Daybreak that are still going (kinda) strong for many years.\n\nEDIT: Everquest has recently became free to play, after 25 years lmao\n\n### Comment ID lb8wv8b with +5 score by [(namakost, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb8wv8b/) (in reply to ID lb8sw64):\nI would understand if they took it blindly with whatever daybreak attached to it, but the devs are so passionate that I can't imagine that they wouldn't put some ground rules for monetization since a big part of palias marketing revolves around free content and accessibility for everyone.\n\n### Comment ID lb9dmm6 with +3 score by [(enbyshaymin, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb9dmm6/) (in reply to ID lb8sw64):\n*Formerly known as Sony Online Entertainment and Verant Interactive, co-developers of EverQuest since 1999.\n\nDaybreak's history is weird af. First, they were part of SISA with which they started developement of EverQuest. Then SOE was made and SISA was renamed into 989 Studios. THEN they went into making PS games, while a branch spun off and formed RedEye Interactive which was then renamed as Verant Interactive.\n\nThen they released EverQuest. Later they were controlled by Sony Pictures which iirc was like, it's grandparent company (Sony Pictures owned SOE which owned Verant), and later in 2015 SOE was sold off to Columbus Nova and Verant changed it's name into Daybreak.\n\nWhich they claim no, they didn't, they were bought by Inception Acquisitions... which was related to Columbus Nova. Which was involved with the Renova Group. Which was... in trouble, to say the least, during 2016. Oh, those russians!\n\nThen in 2018 a mobile game company \"strategically\" invested in Daybreak to port games to mobile... and three rounds of layoffs occurred. Things went awry, it got separated into three teams and then in 2020 they were bought by Enad Global 7. \n\nThey also took over MTG Online in 2022, and it seems they had few layoffs since, with a recent one being of \"less than 15 employees\" from their three branches.\n\nAll that said, S6 may be lucky and have no issues now that Daybreak's situation has changed.\n\n### Comment ID lb9kexf with +3 score by [(h39000, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb9kexf/) (in reply to ID lb8sw64):\nI never had issues w the WoW sub because the game *worked*.

My old long time gamer husband tells me this isnt a bad thing at all. I trust his judgement on this because all I am seeing is folks getting their underwear twisted over how the company choose to fund the work on the game. Frankly we are lucky to have had a free game which hasnt had anything but skins behind a paywall. So how about a bit of positivity and hope instead? S6 have as far as I can tell in the 4 months of playing, given players practically everything they could do within the game mechanics as it stands.  Wanted plushies? you got them.. wanted trees? got them, wanted flow trees on your plot? you got them! Wanted hotpot back? we got it! Bigger houses? got that too....! S6 have listened and delivered where they can. So enough whining and moaning about their partnership with an established game provider, they can rehire, and hopefully we will see the fruits of this soon! If you dont want to buy into stuff then dont but if you are going to moan about a FREE to play game that is still currently in dev mode then you really need to find something else to do with your life.   \nPersonally I think this is rather exciting for S6, it shows confidence from the industry that Palia is viable for the future.\n\n### Comment ID lbbgeoy with +5 score by [(marchviolet, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lbbgeoy/) (in reply to ID lbasarc):\nMy own longtime gamer husband also had a relatively positive reaction to this news when I shared it with him.

They are pretty much the exact opposite of what S6 was about when it comes to monetization. The fact S6 was even open to an acquisition in the first place isn't a good sign but if you couple that with them actually going through with it with such a publisher speaks volumes. This one line from the official acquisition statement says it all.\n\n\"It is incredibly exciting to find like-minded partners who share in our commitment to investing in our products and players for the long-term\"\n\nLet's focus on this a little, \"products\" and \"players\". First off, S6 would never refer to the game as a \"product\", so right from the start you know this section wasn't written by them. Secondly, any time a company mentions 2 things under the same context you should always read them separately like this.\n\n\"It is incredibly exciting to find like-minded partners who share in our commitment to investing in our products\"\n\n\"It is incredibly exciting to find like-minded partners who share in our commitment to investing in our players for the long-term\"\n\nRead that last one about players and what does it sound like to you? I'll spell it out for you just in case...we are the product, not the game. They have invested in a new player base that is outside there normal target audience. Whether this is good or bad will remain to be seen but they have an expectation of a return on that investment and with a game like Palia that could be tricky. It costs more to create something new then it does to place artificial limitations on us and people are far more likely to spend money on a better experience then on a prettier one. So like I originally said, hope for the best but prepare for the worst because the odds are not in our favor here by a long shot and it really pains me because I love this game.\n\nEDIT: Somehow the other half of my comment got cut when I posted lol. So here is my optimistic side.\n\nThis DOES have a bright side to it. Investment from a bigger company can be a really good thing. Most of the games under Daydreams publishing are actually good games if you ignore the monetization factor. The world building and lore behind most of them are top notch, but the story writing tends to be a little lack luster. S6 however has great writing and a LOT of lore and world elements to build upon so with Daydreams backing Palia has a lot going for it in a good way.\n\n## Comment ID lb83d6r with +9 score by [(haffasandwitch, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lb83d6r/) (in reply to ID 1dt7ujt):\n![gif](giphy|7doqMMIYTH1Zkq9mpY|downsized)\n\n## Comment ID lbbmyo0 with +4 score by [(TwistedReads, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lbbmyo0/) (in reply to ID 1dt7ujt):\nwell. good run everyone see you in the next game!\n\n## Comment ID lbdyjsa with +6 score by [(evaperated, Reddit, 2024-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1dt7ujt/daybreak_game_company/lbdyjsa/) (in reply to ID 1dt7ujt):\nHonestly I’m a huge fan of the battle pass model, and would welcome something like that in Palia.

It was basicaly Sci-Fi Warcraft, but it didn’t feel as “WoW clone” at all. The World Building was on point and it was all funny and jokes most of the time, but very serious when an important story archs happened. Just a perfect way how to tell a story imho.\n\nGameplay-wise it had everything what you wanted from an OG theme park mmorpg, but in a modern coat. Dungeons, raids, pvp bgs and arenas, ranked modes, awesome housing system, the list goes on. The best part? It released with all of that stuff. No “alpha” bullshit. Except for bugs and tuning, it just felt finished on the release day.\n\nMany people will disagree with me, but it was THE mmorpg for me. I played from start to shut-down and I wish I re-lived it again. My only real problems with the game was the simplified gearing system ( just 1 weapon per class ) and the telegraph spell system just wasn’t right in large scale battles ( most of the ground were just green and red circles and you couldn’t see anything in battlegrounds for example.)\n\n#### Comment ID lbb3stf with +27 score by [(Deadpoetic6, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbb3stf/) (in reply to ID lbb1yz9):\nTheme,  world, music, combat, housing, artstyle\n\n#### Comment ID lbck51e with +5 score by [(aplcdr, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbck51e/) (in reply to ID lbb1yz9):\nClasses were a lot of fun, I liked race design and the housing system is probably the best that there has ever been\n\n#### Comment ID lbbmdjc with +20 score by [(Akhevan, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbbmdjc/) (in reply to ID lbb1yz9):\n> What features did it have or what was so universally enjoyed about it?\n\nThe fact that it closed down.  \n\nIt was plagued by shitty design decisions and everybody largely hated it while it was still running.\n\n#### Comment ID lbbicbf with +29 score by [(BeatDownn, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbbicbf/) (in reply to ID lbb1yz9):\nPeople just want what they can't have.

While it can be ensured they will implement some type of monetization for in-game benefits/rewards, the extent that it will be P2W or significantly P2W is hard to determine as they are all over the spectrum.\n\n## Comment ID lbbellw with +50 score by [(Cavissi, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbbellw/) (in reply to ID 1dtp97n):\nPalia was a big miss for me, and I'm basically the intended audience.

The devs themselves were greedy and lazy and doubled down when called out about it (like adding a well requested thing behind a paywall) or instead of adding actual meaningful content they add costumes which sucked and were overpriced. Not even to get into the “mmo” aspect of the game.

But it was also filled with hackers (from the East, some in america.) \n\n  \nBut they've also closed over 20 games in their time. (From 1997 to 2018 on the [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daybreak_Game_Company), at least.)\n\nI've been into Palia for some time, threw a couple bucks into the game because I enjoyed supporting the Devs for the inital launch. But if Daybreak is as hands on as they usually are, this game is going to go one of two ways.\n\n  \n1. They stay mostly hands-off, allow S6 team to develop within healthy timeframes and put out content.\n\n2. They grab unto the game with such force and forcefeed it more in store items (P2w items, convience items, premium pass,etc.)\n\n  \nFor now? I can't say for sure, but I am biased in my examination of the situation as Daybreak has been horrible about alot of cashgrab things, not caring for titles, etc. Overall, I hope the S6 team does well enough to support their families and relatives. Because while these are game companies, there are people on the team who don't get a say in what happens.\n\n### Comment ID lbbwt2d with +2 score by [(thystro, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbbwt2d/) (in reply to ID lbbjji2):\nH1Z1 Survive was fking great\n\n#### Comment ID lbc4ksh with +1 score by [(Starbound_Selly, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbc4ksh/) (in reply to ID lbbwt2d):\nIt really was, I made a small group of friends on there.

Whatever that means to you, to me it means playing as and with a group.\nPalia has virtually zero of that. We can argue there's some in hunting and cooking. But barely. Feels more like something that happened by accident rather than design. The new tree dweller for instance is a lot of fun as a group.\n\nStill on the social aspect... No actual common goals.\nNo specialization and no trading. A spouse that farms whatever all day has no proper way to help their significant other than to actually go farm with them again. Random gift limits \nSocial Friend requests that cant be cancelled and forever perpetuate your list.\nOne of the 3 souls that still plays with me can't connect since the previous patch.\n\nTickets that have zero personalization. Straight out of a script and a request to send logs. Even on trivial things.\n\nPatches. There are many game devs here. We know how it is. HOWEVER... You can't always excuse it. If you already have the framework and are reskining things, the whole setup shouldn't break. Adding quest dialogue when you already have a quest system shouldn't be a server breaking ordeal.\nIf you are struggling with seasonal content like every other game does... You need a better testing group.\nThere has yet to be a single patch that didn't devolve into overtime. Not one. Even quick hotfixes have done it sometimes.\nAlso, if you add a \"let me do this quest later\" option... How about testing to make sure it works? A game breaking issue from the new NPC I saw no mention of since it was identified.\nYet, the new cosmetics keep coming at increased prices.\nI have no issue on this topic, but on the subject of optics, you have game breaking bugs but you project an appearance of cosmetics having priority, which will inevitably turn some players away.\n\nAnd finally, on the subject of PC player retention...\nWhile we understand you're aiming for a Switch release and probably have technical limitations to consider...\nDecades now of observing mmo players should be a STRONG indication that be it the competitive, builder or gatherer player type, \"more\" is the goal.\nHaving limitations has given you an (hopefully) unintended \"game over\".\nGold limitations, renown limitations, storage limitations, building limitations, heck, even farming limitations, are only going to turn the non casual player away. If you want players online most of their free time, this is not a good approach.\n\nIn sum, I have capped my gold, crafted all the furniture, maxed storage, farming, all rep is maxed...\nIt is now a game I sometimes load once a week to do weekly medals and forget about it the rest of the week. And even this amounts to 5 minutes of \"hey, want to catch 10 bugs with me?\". \n\nAnd then we load a game that let's us play together for a common goal.\n\nTldr, please make your social game... Social.\n\n### Comment ID kca3916 with +10 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kca3916/) (in reply to ID kc8noze):\n100% this.

Open beta and early access are now really just terms for games that have been released incomplete and probably not to a good standard. If anyone who wants to can play your game you've released it. \n\nAlpha beta etc used to be testing stages in development that would tell you how close to the finished product they were. Now games release as open beta and stay that way for years taking people's money at the same time. That isn't a testing phase. That is a company trying to get money from an unfinished product. \n\nPersonally I don't think beta games should be allowed to charge. The industry is largely unregulated and it shows that these practices have become accepted and normal. And it's leads to situations like this where people have invested in something in good faith which then performs pretty poorly\n\n### Comment ID kca5c5j with +7 score by [(ImpressiveElection94, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kca5c5j/) (in reply to ID kc8yzcr):\nI agree?

While they probably had some start up money (the founders are well respected names in the Gaming industry) that money won't last forever, where do the funds come from for this long of a beta/alpha/testing? They aren't asking for a monthly fee, it's not pay to win even in whatever phase it's currently in, which I confess, is a mystery to me even now but I do recognize they ask for nothing from us. Purchasing sparkly outfits helps to keep the lights on in Palia and pay their people, you know they are hurting when they lay off 35% of their workforce and if I recall correctly they are down to just 109 workers for Palia, while 109 sounds like a lot it's really not for an Online video game, a small workforce like that can strangle a game. Outfit choices are completely optional and NOT forced on you. No one is making you purchase anything. All those people playing for free need to thank the people who do purchase the trivial things from the clothing shop, they are the ones keeping Palia alive at the end of the day. I buy their outfits and I don't even think twice about it because I enjoy the game and DO want to see it fully released and receiving updates, doesn't bother me one bit it's Beta or whatever it is currently.

With both an announced \"Holiday 2023\" Switch release (which we know isn't going to happen) and the monetization with the opening and regular stocking of the premium store, we have/had every right to believe this game was in a trajectory to full release if not at a minimun more regular and bug free (or at least bug reduced) content updates.\n\nThis game is getting more unplayable patch by patch. And I just wonder how much of a coincidence it is the Switch release page was taken down before this disasterous patch. S6 couldn't pretend anymore that this game was coming to Switch any time soon?\n\n### Comment ID kc9tkj6 with +4 score by [(ImpressiveElection94, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc9tkj6/) (in reply to ID kc9fiko):\nYes, with those numbers I got now, I get why many anticipated more and aren't satisfied right now. The Switch situation is really making me anxious even though I can understand why. The game is nowhere near release for Switch. As far as I know, games on the Switch are usually so ready, that they aren't Beta anymore. This game needs much more time for that. Well, I hope they get it done with the bug fixing. I really like that game and the potential for the future, so I cheer for their success.\n\n#### Comment ID kcidcfp with +2 score by [(Stealthwarfox, Reddit, 2023-12-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kcidcfp/) (in reply to ID kc9tkj6):\nThey just announced last night at the game awards it will be released on switch December 14.\n\n## Comment ID kcad7kc with +14 score by [(kwonhoshi, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kcad7kc/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nI'm sorry but it's just embarrassing to release an update that renders the game unplayable.

But beta can't excuse all the problems  Palia has. Nor 'It iS fReE!11\". It's a product above all, and it simply must have some quality in it, otherwise it's just a bad product, free or not, beta or not.\n\nGame breaking bugs that prevent progress; quests that cannot be completed; horrible climbing. Most if not all those things MUST have been fixed in closed alpha (or at least closed beta), not be present in open beta for everyone to see. It's the job of QA department to find and fix those bugs before the game or patch it released. And those guys either don't exist, do their job poorly or have very little time to do it. Then it's management fault, making devs release new  patch every two weeks. But it can't be justified by 'It's just beta!'. It's bad decisions that lead to bad state of the game and then lead to players leaving.\n\nS6 is not a small indie studio, but right now this game is playing like some Steam early access indie game from a single developer. Or even worse, indie game from Patreon.\n\nI wish all well for Palia, but its current state is bad. If it was in alpha, sure, I would have no problem with that. But in open beta? Just nope.\n\n### Comment ID kc8jfym with +5 score by [(Shoddy-Temperature16, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc8jfym/) (in reply to ID kc7tb0d):\nQA doesn't fix bugs, QA finds and documents them. From there the bug is handed off to either the dev who owns the feature the bug exists in or more like to the production/project management staff who will decide when fixing it fits into the existing timeline and schedule. QA can in most cases argue for an increase in priority for the bug but usually a bug that is not \"this crashes or prevents players from playing the game every time for all system configuration we test on\" will end up finding it's way into the backlog. \n\nAt most places I have worked QA doesn't have access to commit code, nor are they paid enough to expect them to have that skill set. If they do have those skills they either jump ship to the game engineering side of the house or go the technical test analyst/software development engineer in test route and work on writing code to automate tests or make tools to help the manual tests work faster.\n\n#### Comment ID kc8onq5 with +5 score by [(Kirful, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc8onq5/) (in reply to ID kc8jfym):\nOkay, my bad, sorry.

If we want more quests, areas, progression, recipes, NPCs, events, game growth, etc. we need to understand that this happens, happens often, and we need to take a breath and understand that they’re doing everything they can to get things going again (if only so they can get home to their families).\n\nThe other thing I tell myself is that this is a free game. I have had subscription games that were down a lot in the first year. World of Warcraft was one of them. I participated from closed Beta on in that game (until Mists where I got bored) and the first year was rough with downtime.

Where I work (not game industry) the devs roll out several upgrades for several components daily. Generally you want deployment (and rollback) to be so easy and smooth that it's not stressful to deploy just whenever.\n\n> He’s had to long hours on a time crunch and then Bam! QA missed something and things have gone sideways and now his team has to stay over and figure it out. \n\nThis is, generally, an industry anti-pattern and a sign of poor workplace routines.

My objection is rolling out a sizable (in this game's history) patch with existing bugs not being addressed. Party invites being broken for the past two weeks  is very tangible. People bicker resources, especially flow, and being able to invite someone to your party would stop a lot of scolding as soon as it starts. Last I knew, the game was crashing when you clicked on a person's name to add them as a friend. These are fundamentals of the MMO model, and honestly essential to a game that markets itself as \"cozy.\" I'd honestly rather wait a week for the holiday update if we could get party invites and friend requests back. :)\n\n## Comment ID kc9sqtb with +15 score by [(relosa_, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc9sqtb/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nI am not really all that bothered by the bugs. Because it's beta. Stuff is just gonna go wrong, that's fine. I don't even care about the downtime. Am I pleased that it crashed/froze/required hard restart 5 times in one hour this morning and I couldn't fish? No. Am I terribly surprised it's *that* borked? Also no. Did I witness myself some of the QOL improvements and appreciate them? Very much yes. \n\nWhat I *do* care about is the unprofessionalism in communicating about it. It's immature and oddly self-centered and WAY too on-the-nose with the branding. What I'm about to say is in good faith because I *want* Palia to reach alpha, I *want* S6 to grow. Most are not gonna like it and will downvote because they don't understand the difference between business practices and branding.\n\nThere are specific things that *need* to be stated clearly in updates that weren't even mentioned. The website itself doesn't even have a server/game status page. Not everyone uses discord and it should not ever be the primary communications center.\n\nIf there's a major outage, planned or not, *especially* when they're the ones to pull it offline, that needs to be loud and clear on every platform they use. Scheduled outages should be sending emails as well. IMO it came across as that they *really* didn't want any new or casual players to know there was an outage at all. They *know* the daily players and community members would be on it. But it's the kind of thing you just have to own up to ASAP. \n\nContext: I have 10+ years in risk management, operations training, planning, comms, and hands-on emergency stuff.\n\nWhat their updates should have read like was:\n\n\"Hey everyone, we have some bad news. The patch release didn't go as planned and the demand on the servers plus bugs and errors clashed. We've taken everything offline and are investigating. While we're disappointed that you cannot enjoy Winterlight and the QOL fixes just yet, we understand this is probably even more disappointing for you. We'll let you know as soon as we have any information. You can find status updates at  \\[URL\\]. Thank you for your patience!\"\n\nOnce they had repairs under way and did not have an ETA:\n\n\"Good news is that we've located the issue and have begun correcting it. Unfortunately we don't yet have an estimated uptime and we'll definitely let you know when that changes. We do know that the issue was internal and your game and personal data is safe.\"\n\nClear, kind, respectful, informative, and not full of mealy-mouthed weirdly self-serving brand-speak that never once acknowledged the users except with really condescending comments like \"for those who are being patient\" and \"those who are sending positive vibes!\"\n\nMost of all, it comes across as *we have this under control.* But instead last night it came across as \"wow look at us doing our jobs! isn't that neat! boy are we tired!\" as if they were doing us a favor. \n\nFree or not, every player is still a consumer and S6 is a for-profit business. **This is their job;** no, I will not pat them on the back for doing it. Especially after getting it back online it's still having the same issues. What I *will* commend is if they manage the actual front-facing part well, which they did not. \n\nI know I'm gonna get downvoted for this but sorry, I'm right. I shared the messages with others in comms training and backgrounds. Some were Palians and some were not. I asked them what their impression was of the situation and they all came back with the same thing: short-sighted and unprofessional.\n\n This was a comms disaster. And it still is IMO. Not even mentioning the fact that the Switch thing was pulled with no information whatsoever and it hasn't been addressed as far as I know.\n\nBeta doesn't just mean the game itself but as a new and growing company it also means branding, crisis management, and retention. They are setting an extremely poor example of what happens when things might go even worse and if they do not sharpen communications they will not see the growth they deserve.\n\n### Comment ID kccmfjj with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kccmfjj/) (in reply to ID kc9sqtb):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID kcdtp10 with +2 score by [(relosa_, Reddit, 2023-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kcdtp10/) (in reply to ID kccmfjj):\nThe exact same thing happened to me in the discord when I mentioned how unprofessional it was.

For all we know they need the cash to repay backers or maybe it's a condition of the Switch release (Nintendo isn't putting up the game for free) - all this \"but the devs have to eat....\" stuff is childish.\n\n#### Comment ID kc9xanw with +3 score by [(relosa_, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc9xanw/) (in reply to ID kc9guf6):\nYes, thank you!

I feel like there's some valid criticism of course after all it's frustrating to be playing a buggy and unfinished game and there's some bugs that are ok in beta and some that are game breaking. Still I'm completely with you, it's a game from a new small studio, no matter how experienced the developers are they don't have the same tools bigger companies do. And beta is their best tool to test and improve their game . I'm a software engineering masters degree student and so the bugs , the time for updates, the unfinished or not yet added features are very normal for me and don't bother me. About the game itself, since I'm busy with school I end up playing for just a few hours a day but I've identified that the game is a bit \"slow\" if you wanna play everyday all the time cus a lot of tasks take time, still there's a lot to do and I haven't explored everything yet. I love most of the objectives of the game and have a lot of fun. It really helps my mental health being so cosy and playing it so light-heartedly . I'm really excited for the festive updates and yesterday I really wanted to play cus I had just came from a test at college and ofc I was sad when they brought the servers back down. but I actually joined the discord like 2 days ago and seeing the updates...they're working, they're trying. And there's nothing more frustrating than finding bugs after fixing other bugs. So uk they're doing their best and that's all anyone can ask.\n\n### Comment ID kcah49k with +12 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kcah49k/) (in reply to ID kc8ecfw):\nCasual reminder this is not a small studio and the funding they have is pretty huge.\n\n## Comment ID kcb5vwk with +5 score by [(Er1nyes, Reddit, 2023-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kcb5vwk/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nI think Palia would benefit from a test server before releasing to the wider Palia community. Other small studios have done this with great effect. Coffee Stain who produce Valheim is a good example.\n\nAll patches were first run thru thier Public Test Server (PTS) before being released to the \"live\" server. Everyone who participated on the pts, knew thier game could be rolled back & progress lost as devs worked out kinks in each update/patch. If you were not prepared to deal with that you simply waited for the updates to go \"live\" and it is probably one of the most stable games still in early release.\n\nI don't doubt for a minute that the S6 team are working their butts off trying to get the game working but I also think they need to concentrate more on core game play before introducing new cosmetics.\n\n## Comment ID kcbjzm6 with +4 score by [(magvadis, Reddit, 2023-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kcbjzm6/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nY'all there is no test server we are the test server.\n\n## Comment ID kc7tlhg with +14 score by [(BosEriko, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc7tlhg/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nWhen people say the team is small i always remember how stardew was created by a single person.\n\n### Comment ID kc8cd26 with +11 score by [(JoanyC11, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc8cd26/) (in reply to ID kc7tlhg):\nUndertale, Rollercoaster Tycon, Stardew, among others were made by single people in ways that are simply extraordinary. But it's exactly that to make a game alone you need to be quite the programming genius, know a lot of different areas and spend probably YEARS AND YEARS developing. Programming is hard (I'm a software engineer master's degree student) and most of the times to develop an app much simpler than a game you need a few elements of a team like a front end and backend developer, a team to make the design, a team to make the unit tests etc etc. It's amazing what some people do but if we expect every studio to do extraordinary things it's like expecting every human that has experience with science to be Einstein or something. Non the less some developers are faster than others and that's ok. And sometimes we'll be frustrated cus it seems like a lot of times and it's human we just don't know how hard their working and the problems they ran into etc.\n\n### Comment ID kc7w9kz with +17 score by [(xlaauurraaa, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc7w9kz/) (in reply to ID kc7tlhg):\nI think when we talk about this, no one talks about *how* he made the game. like how he worked over 15+ hours on days, dedicated time for friends to working on the game, stayed up unhealthy hours. and he did have help, just not in the traditional sense of help, and much later into the games years. ConcernedApe dedicated his whole life to Stardew in an almost unhealthy way imo. even now, when he talks about it, you can tell he loves it, but he's sometimes so burnt out or frazzled.

Some teams have grandiose visions for 1.0 and leave on the beta label years after what is essentially 1.0. I think the only meaningful metric for a game being or not being in beta is if it is selling any sort of products - which Palia is doing.\n\nAt the end of the day I don't think it matters all that much if a game is in beta or not if you are a player and not a tester. You are rightfully upset if you have issues but you should manage your expectations against the reality of the dev team size and maturity of the game itself. Palia is a recently out beta MMO managed by a small team when it comes to MMO metrics and getting overly upset that it has issues is an error on your part. Take a break from any game if you find yourself overly upset.\n\n### Comment ID kcezam0 with +2 score by [(ImpressiveElection94, Reddit, 2023-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kcezam0/) (in reply to ID kcem21w):\nI srsly don't know what counts as small, but they seem to be around 160 people.

But I know by looking around in-game that many bought stuff, so they seem to be satisfied enough to do that. I hope I get to that point either, because I like that game. Yes, they are recently out in Open Beta. August was the start, right? I'd like to know, if there was something before that. Like a closed Beta or stuff. Even tho I don't believe it. \nAnyways, the game is still a baby. Some want to show their baby as soon as possible to others.

At least this was the case before all this early access stuff began. But these days it seems more like alpha, where much of the game is still being developed. With every stage of added content we get more bugs. It is just the nature of the industry.\n\nSo I try to remember that I am playing a game that is only 1/4 or 1/3 done. If it gets too buggy I suspend play until I read it has improved. I only get upset when some bug has an impact on my character or account achievement or development and it cannot be reversed or fixed eventually. Like an achievement that doesn't trigger.

Been waiting over 4/5 years for the completion of the game! Rejuvenation I meant \n\nPlease Note: I am sober writing this post but let my past experience gaming flow here! Lol!\n\nPalia is a good game, it has A LOT OF POTENTIAL, but it also has a few things that works against it: \n\nLet's start with the paid feature- the store items are too expensive. With or without the pet as an added bonus. If you spread out the costs a little more then people may be inclined to buy more. I don't have any original ideas but others may. \n\nGame play: between the main plot objectives the game gets a bit boring, but then again maybe I Have been playing it wrong because hunting for bugs or fishing may be optional but I'm too stupid to get that whole system- would rather hunt.\n\nTransport/travel: Now as Palia is a magical world without too much technology to ruin the aesthetics it still is a medium sized map (compared to Fallout 4) tiny compared to Minecraft and the Witcher 1 and small compared to Rejuvenation and Reborn.  That being said I became totally enthralled with the idea of (DON'T LAUGH) Hunting Down a MYTHICAL STAG/Bear to RIDE AROUND! Which adds another opportunity for more shop items! Even being able to customize that stag or bear brings a whole new bag of opportunity and problems.  \n\nPuzzles: I love solving puzzles and just hunting down some items that give more lore to the environment: Like what is it with the white structures scattered throughout Palia? Where has the former tenant of your plot of land gone? Is he truly nuts or was he DaVinci or Einstein or Galileo of the Palia universe?   \n\nFishing: I hate the system but then again I don't like that feature in rejuvenation either. But don't take it out I guess I am just a bit stiff about it. Just need to get used to it \n\nBuildings: I like the system you currently have, things clip easily and although it is limited it has great potential- I would just add some rounded structures and an option for top floors and stairs, heck a floor with a hole and a pole to swing down! Vines to climb up and down!  \n\nFurniture use: I don't know I would like to be able to store clothes in a cupboard, Like say I just bought a pink party dress and a green Elvin hunting set of clothes I want to open the cupboard and see them in there, but again don't stress this too much- none of the games I played got this right either!  Which neatly brings me over to the library: I would love to browse and buy books- recipes and bestiaries, I don't know maybe checklists for maybe the bugs and fish you collect with more information per the species you've encountered area they are available in with a spot on the map, time and the kind of fishing rod and bait required? \n\nQuests: Please forgive me but there are times that the dialogue plays and something happens in real life that makes you skip the dialogue by accident: cat jumps on the keyboard, baby slaps the mouse etc. and lets say that dialogue was important but you cannot go back and revisit that conversation which means you've missed something important to the story line or a hint as to where you are to go but a list of DETAILED explanations on the quest may be good for this, I had to go look at Wiki, Google, Reddit and YouTube way too many times as some of the quest descriptions are too vague or do not give you enough information from the get-go. Or add lines and optional clues in character dialogues. \n\nRarity of resources: Now this one may be interesting- bear with me: \n\nFallout 4 has a few medicines that are EXTREMELY RARE: X-Cell, Day Tripper, AND Daddy-O. Minecraft has diamonds that were extremely rare before the newest update, Craft the World has Heroes, Pokémon Rejuvenation and Reborn have Event and Legendary Pokémon: Now bare in mind I haven't really played long enough to completely say I have a handle on what is Really Rare- except for Pallium but this also has an exploit which takes away from it's rare status. May I suggest you remove the Group bonus feature from mining this RARE ingredient? As far as I understand it is Rare for a reason? \n\nFood crafting- I want to be able to see the food I make on a plate (not sure if it's in game but I haven't really explored food crafting too much either), Can I ask that one could be able to buy them from the library too?   \n\nRelationship status: Okay Now THIS was WHAT MADE ME QUIT!  You are told to find a shepp- THAT'S IT!  \n\nYou are not told that \n\n1) YOU CANNOT ASK ANYONE with a FRIENDSHIP LEVEL BELOW LEVEL 4 to be your shepp as they Will REFUSE YOU \n\n2) You cannot ask an NPC to be your Shepp more than ONCE  and Finally\n\n3) The Shepp option is ALWAYS available in the dialogue options thus if you get tired of their drivel and skip too quickly through their dialogue you have a VERY HIGH CHANCE OF Accidently asking them to be your Shepp  and all your hard work is GONE! \n\nFallout 4 has done this dialogue option EXTREMELY well by limiting WHAT you can say to which character at different relationship levels. I am sorry I am not going through all the ups and downs of building up a relationship level again. The characters that I was interested in becoming my Shepp I made the mistake of asking too early. The others bore me to tears or irritate me enough to try shoot them with the bow and arrows (doesn't work) \n\nNow please note I wrote this with a light-hearted approach and I mean this as constructive criticism. All and all I would love to play Palia again- I like the game, but as to the shepp quest- I asked and cannot ask again so this is a wall for me in the game and I won't be returning until that is resolved. \n\nNeither will I pay to play either.\n\n### Comment ID kca3kdl with +1 score by [(ImpressiveElection94, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kca3kdl/) (in reply to ID kc92o0n):\nFirst I'd like to thank you for the time you took to write all this! 😶 And don't worry, I think of it like constructive criticism.\nNow let's get started:\n\nTo the monetization I can't say much about a better approach besides that it may have been a bit too soon, if you think about the progress of the game. I think many might not consider it \"worthy\" of getting money as of now. Me included. As soon as I get the feeling that the game gets \"completed\", I might buy stuff. But that should take time, with what I've seen up till now. But then again, I see many in fancy costumes,  so it might work out after all? How to switch the numbers for more people to buy stuff is something I can't even imagine. I'm just too poor to buy stuff higher than 20€ without batting an eye.\n\nGame play might be repetitive very fast as there isn't much story quests right now, but I'm pretty sure they'll add more. Like more ressources in each category to farm and stuff. I don't think they'll change the system as I think they want the players to be able to do just what they enjoy. At least to a certain extent. You need to mine to make your axe better and stuff. But I think that's pretty normal in games. I find the game cozy and chill besides the bugs.\n\nTransport and Travel: Ooooh, I'd LOVE that!!!\n\nPuzzles: I love puzzles, too! I think some might come with new ruins, but I'd love small ones in the overworld, too!\n\nBuildings: Yes, PLEASE! Especially stairs, as soon as I built just one additional room I wanted it!\n\nLibrary: Yes, that would be great. I wouldn't be surprised, if they already considered it for the future. \n\nStory: Yes, I feel you! Even if I saw everything,  there are times I'd like to be able to look up what was said again. Hope they add something like that. \n\nRessources: There's a group bonus for mining? I know that fishing has it and foraging Flowtrees requires you to have someone tag along if it is a fully grown tree, but mining? I might have missed something? I'm still not a veteran in this game, so there might be things I just don't know. \n\nFood: You can place star quality food in your farm! On tables, in fridges, basically everywhere with a designated surface for putting stuff on/in it.\n\nNow I get back to the clothes as it's already possible with food, so making that available for clothes would be great! Just dunno how much work that is,  as I'm no programmer...\n\nRelationship: Yes, it's not really stated that you need friendship Level 4, before they'll become your Shepp.\nBUT!: You aren't lost! You can still get the person to be your Shepp even though you asked to early! I panicked with Tish as I asked her and the option to ask just disappeared. But through the community I got to know that when you reach Level 4 with your target person and complete the quest for that, after an in-game day the option reappears and you can get your Shepp! Again, it's not stated in-game. I'd like to be informed about both cases (knowing Shepp condition and that you can ask again after Level 4 Quest) in-game.\n\nI hope that alleviates your anxiety, which I felt, too and was really, REALLY unsettling for me, and you can enjoy the game more knowing you can still get your Shepp!\n\n## Comment ID kc8epn6 with +2 score by [(Strong_Investment312, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18bzrls/palia_is_still_beta/kc8epn6/) (in reply to ID 18bzrls):\nIf we choose to play a game in Beta, we accept that there will be bugs and glitches….it’s your choice to play or not to play.

      "# Post ID 1bqq6c8: Palia Dev Update: “we’ll keep our players updated with as much information as possible as we approach what we consider to be our official launch.” with +314 score by [(kyleblane, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/)\n[https://palia.com/news/dev-update-7](https://palia.com/news/dev-update-7)\n\nFull Text (of beta section)\n\n>**Palia is Currently in Open Beta**  \n>  \n>We want to clear the air: since our Open Beta launch back in August 2023, the **game remains as a title still in Open Beta**. Know that we’ll keep our players updated with as much information as possible as we approach what we consider to be our official launch.  \n>  \n>We're aware that there has been feedback regarding our messaging and status on various platforms, but the emphasis is that Palia is free-to-play and available for anyone to try. It is a continuous, ongoing effort, and we are committed to providing patch updates with new content, improvements, and bug fixes well into the future.  \n>  \n>In fact, looking at our version, being on 0.178 means we’ve made over 178 updates to the game! Even from the start, and the days of Pre-Alpha, we made sure to include player feedback and have it shape Palia to be where it is today. And when it’s ready, we also plan to have the versioning update from “0.XXX” to “1.XXX” to better reflect Palia’s new status — but even that is not the end. We’ll keep having more patches after, and developing Palia alongside our players. That was one of the primary reasons why we wanted it to be a free-to-play, live-service game.  \n>  \n>We invite everyone to be part of this journey.\n\nFirst of all, when you need to \"clear the air\" that your game is still in beta you've failed at the most basic communication about your game.\n\nThe bare minimum required to provide \"as much information as possible\" as your game approaches launch is to properly inform players that the game hasn't yet been launched. Steam and Epic versions should be in Early Access. Switch should have some form of \"beta\" mentioned somewhere. The word \"beta\" should exist somewhere on the website other than news updates and the EULA. It's a very easy decision to make, and a very easy change to implement.\n\nThis dev update is void of any definitive action they're going to take. They only say that they are aware of the feedback and are focusing on communicating that the game is free (As if the two messages can't coexist LOL). I hope I'm wrong and this is just a poorly worded update, but I don't expect to see any communication changes regarding the beta status of the game.\n\n## Comment ID kx6h2br with +73 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx6h2br/) (in reply to ID 1bqq6c8):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID kx7hkxm with +15 score by [(OreoYip, Reddit, 2024-03-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx7hkxm/) (in reply to ID kx6h2br):\nI am okay with the conversations but honestly, it is getting a bit old hat.

The majority of people do not want that and as a mod, and a very active participant of the sub, I don't want that either.   \n\nIt is important that people know about games and any serious issues but going forward, a megathread has been created because this game and the drama surrounding it is pulling focus from other threads and attracting negative attention from people that are not in this group but want to jump in on the drama.   \n\nAs long as the conversation is kept civil, rules are followed, and there is absolutely no mention, complaints, or calls for brigading on other subs (which is against Reddit TOS and jeopardizes the entire sub), I have no problems.\n\n#### Comment ID kx7jnf5 with +7 score by [(11_roo, Reddit, 2024-03-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx7jnf5/) (in reply to ID kx7hkxm):\ntrust me, if r/palia allowed these conversations we would be there.\n\n#### Comment ID kx7j54i with +1 score by [(kyleblane, Reddit, 2024-03-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx7j54i/) (in reply to ID kx7hkxm):\nThanks for the work you do.

UI text size sliders - for people who are playing on Steam Deck for example! Brightness sliders - maybe you just prefer your games to not be that bright! And then other accessibility options  include making the temples doable without having to do complicated maneuvers and having to react at exactly the right time etc etc - some disabled players won't be able to fulfill the challenges at all as they are now, but even players who can fulfill the challenges might not want to do this kind of challenge. I personally get super annoyed with all of the temples, as the rest of the game (except for hunting and some bug catching stuff) is way lower stakes and I fucking hate when I have to jump precisely in games. So I'd profit from an option to do this challenge in an easier way, too (and my keyboard and desk would love that too cause I get really angry and frustrated 😅)\n\n### Comment ID kx4dyj4 with +24 score by [(TheSilentTragedy, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx4dyj4/) (in reply to ID kx4914c):\nAlso this. Many of my friends (many of which were active members of the accessibility channel there) were banned the other day for asking questions, one was banned simply because they wanted to know why their mute had persisted longer than it was supposed to (they were muted for an extra hour instead of the original mute time). \n\nTheir mods/devs have admitted that they have a hard time remaining unbiased regarding critic of the game - in my most respectful and honest opinion, the biggest problem they have (in regard to their Discord) is a lack of a well-acting, level-headed moderation team.\n\n#### Comment ID kx4efjj with +26 score by [(kyleblane, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx4efjj/) (in reply to ID kx4dyj4):\nEarlier on Discord I was asking about details regarding this dev update.

It never was announced to be out of beta, and when loading the game up via steam at least, it still says \"beta\" in a yellow frame under the name of the game.

I base it on the reviews. But I'm reading this post from the devs and think they are back peddling due to backlash. Honestly, imo it's easier to justify bugs for games in early access. It would be to their advantage to put it under the early access banner. Why they didn't, I don't really understand. People would give them a pass for bugs. \n\nMaybe they should mention at least in the text of the steam store for the game that it's in beta. Not hidden in the announcement.

Please forgive any crappy formatting on mobile.\n\nDecember 2023 Switch update:\nNo mention of Beta anywhere on the Nintendo eshop page. For weeks leading up to the release multiple members in the discord tagged CMs asking for clarification. CMs would conveniently disappear from conversation or straight up ignore the question while responding to other members. Game launches and what’s missing from the splash page on the switch? The beta tag. The excuse then became “oh well Nintendo doesn’t do beta/early access so take it up with them”. Sandrock was quite literally hosting an early access at this time. \n\nFebruary 2024:\nThey announce the steam release. Members point out that the MMO tag has been scrubbed and there’s no mention of the game being in beta. Every week members would be tagging the CMs to ask and get clarification, warning the CMs that this would lead to negative reviews. The CM response was gifs and saying they’d pass it along to the rest of the team. Members also noted that the Palia website had also been scrubbed of the beta label at this time.\n\nBefore this they were telling people they banned for questioning the lack of beta tag that they had no control over what steam labeled the game as and now it’s too late because once a game has been published you can no longer mark it as early access and beta. \n\nI know this doesn’t matter to some people and I think that’s perfectly fine BUT for some of us a company being intentionally deceitful repeatedly is a big red flag. Many of us have played for hundreds of hours, sunk money into the game and built a community with people inside and outside of the game so we’re feeling quite passionate and honestly concerned about the way things are going. \n\nI’d also like to add this is a team that brags about being industry vets, these are people that know what they’re doing and are now trying to handwave all this away with “oh we’re still learning”. This isn’t a small indie team and hell even small indie teams know to mark a game in beta/EA. Honestly this dev update is only in response to the negative feedback there’s not even any mention of accountability, this wording it reads to me like “well it’s free so who cares”. I care! They have a cash shop and yes it’s optional BUT there is still a way for people to spend money on game by a company that is intentionally trying to mislead its player base and I’m sorry but I’m not okay with that.\n\n### Comment ID kx4ktvz with +23 score by [(kyleblane, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1bqq6c8/palia_dev_update_well_keep_our_players_updated/kx4ktvz/) (in reply to ID kx4k5ml):\nBravo for good formatting on mobile.

I don’t want to yuck other peoples yum lol! I haven’t left a review and try not to speak negatively of the game even in the discord now because I can see it’s bringing a lot of people joy BUT I also feel like it’s causing people to have major blinders on.

Thanks OP for sharing and I completely agree with your take! \n\nThe update from the Palia team comes off defensive and doesn’t have any accountability in the failure to communicate the status of their game. It being free doesn’t negate it from criticism or basic expectations of knowing it isn’t fully launched. \n\nThis honestly makes me want to uninstall.

I've been saying they've been shady since their post about sitting in chairs coming off as more of a \"there. Aren't you guys glad we did this for you? You should be happy we did (the bare minimum) hard work with sit-tech and now you can sit in chairs so stop pestering us.\" Post. (Not the exact quote but it did feel very passive aggressive)\n\nI remember saying that despite this game being free with optional microtransactions, this was going to be one of those barely updated, barely fixed games with barely anything in it worth playing but the store would be absolutely cluttered with new stuff. What happened when I stated that? \n\nDeath threats(yes. I kid you not lmfao) the typical \"It's free. Stop complaining.\", then there were the \"They're taking their time to get it right. If you don't like it don't play it.\" (I stopped around the time they dropped the news that outfits will always be microtransactions) and then people telling me that I was too poor to play the game and I was just a poor hater. Lmao. \n\nWell, despite all those people jumping my butt, I am glad but also disappointed to see that I was mostly right. It's a shame because I hoped they'd take player feedback seriously and make this a game worth sticking around for...but once again, game companies be game company-ing. Glad I didn't hang on to that hope and get let down like I am sure many others have. \n\nI am sorry to those who looked forward to this game being something amazing. Hopefully the game grind loop is enough to keep you playing long enough until a better game comes out for you.

Although, I quit that, so who knows if it got any better or if it is going down the direction I thought it would.\n\nI mean, I hope it got better, so those people who shrugged their shoulders saying \"It's free! I got hundreds of hours\" Can have their fun. Ideally every game would have a redemption arc like No Mans Sky and Cyberpunk.\n\nIt's exhausting to see casual gamers defend this type of stuff again and again. Sure, they can make their own decisions*, but I thought ignorance was the issue. But it's not, they literally don't care and don't want to care, and... I see this in politics and so many other more important areas that it's just annoying. Companies/whatever are going to keep getting worse because people will keep buying/voting the same way because they just don't care. Worse, they'll shut you down so they can keep living in ignorance.\n\nI get that this seems a bit dramatic, it's just a game, but... eh. It's a pattern.

      "# Post ID 1aw5ykc: My thoughts on Palia after playing for 3 months with +39 score by [(Pem_Pire, Reddit, 2024-02-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1aw5ykc/my_thoughts_on_palia_after_playing_for_3_months/)\nDon't get me wrong. I love the game, I really do, but it's so frustrating when half the stuff doesn't even work. I can't progress main story quests, I can't cook some of the recipes(including some recipes needed for quests) because certain mechanics don't wanna work. Even the furniture tends to be uncooperative sometimes. Some days I can put small items on the bookshelves with no issues, other days I can't put *anything* on shelves. Whenever I talk to other players about it just to vent, it's always \"submit a report ticket\" which is ridiculous, needing to fill out a ticket seemingly every couple days. Half the time I find myself absent mindedly running around in circles doing nothing productive because I need the time to pass and I can't fill that time using some of the game's features because they're broken. I mean no disrespect to the devs, I know without a doubt that they're working their butts off day in and day out, this post is really just to vent some frustrations I have(some of them are likely my own fault, in all fairness). What they have done with Palia so far is amazing, but I feel like part of me wants to step away for a bit until the game is more polished up. Despite all the bugs and broken features, Palia is still an amazing game with a very charming atmosphere and an incredibly wholesome community surrounding it. \n\nSeeing that this post is mostly negative so far, I wanna point out some positive things. For one, the art style of Palia is so fun and lively, especially the characters who give some nostalgic Pixar vibes(which I absolutely adore! Badruu reminds me of the dad from Inside Out for some reason lol). There is not a single character in the game that I dislike, everyone has really enjoyable designs and personalities, they all feel so unique. While the wildlife as a whole feels like it could use more work(like animal variety), it's still really cool to see herds of sernuk grazing or little chapaas scurrying about their areas. The sceneries and landscapes are gorgeous, so many times have I stopped to take a screenshot or two of my current view, it's fun to explore and see what I can and can't climb on, lol. I also really enjoy the farming aspect of the game. It's not too tedious or overwhelming, like in some other farming games, and in fact feels quite satisfying at times. I will say, part of me feels we should have something like 12 soil patches instead of 9, but that just might be me being greedy if I'm being honest lol. Last thing I'll say before wrapping up this post is how great the community surrounding Palia is. I've yet to encounter any bad eggs personally(except for maybe 1 player who broke a pal node in front of a group instead of waiting first, but it's entirely possible they were new and just didn't know better). Just about every player I've spoken too, both in game and on the discord, have been really nice and helpful. I even had an interesting conversation with another player about joint custody over Einar once, which was really funny.\n\nAll in all, Palia is an amazing, one of a kind game despite it having it's fair share of technical issues. I really look forward to what the future holds for Palia and its awesome community\n\nEdit: Thanks for all comments, it's really nice to hear different perspectives from others! To some of the people saying the game is still in open beta, I had no idea. Had I known, I wouldn't have been as critical as I was. The Nintendo Direct that came out 8 or 9 months ago, which is where I first heard of Palia, made zero mention of this fact. Same with when the Switch release date was finally revealed at The Game Awards. As for being told about it when making my account, I never made a Singularity 6 account when I first got the game. I don't remember what I did exactly, but I opted out of making one because I had never heard of this team beforehand and was skeptical. When I continued thru, I was given a warning basically saying that I'd lose everything if something happened to my game because I didn't have an account or something like that, and then it went right on to making my character. At no point did I see anything about the game being in beta. It's possible it said it in the EULA but be realistic here, who actually reads EULAs? Regardless of everything, I'm gonna keep going with the game with a much more open mind now that I know it's still in beta. I plan on continuing my support to both Palia and the wonderful folks at Singularity 6!\n\n## Comment ID krg57zq with +17 score by [(doctorgurlfrin, Reddit, 2024-02-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1aw5ykc/my_thoughts_on_palia_after_playing_for_3_months/krg57zq/) (in reply to ID 1aw5ykc):\nI have a suggestion for the whole “placing items on shelves” issue.

Not everyone enjoys games who are still in open beta, and that is perfectly okay. No shame in that. You can come back in a few months or wait until the game goes out of beta. You clearly enjoy the non buggy parts, so this might be a good solution for you.\n\nFor a game developer it is necessary though to do closed and later open beta. This way they have a big group of test players who can find as many bugs as possible and report them. I feel like this is not made clear when you get the game on Switch though. I have no idea how the beta state of the game is communicated on pc so can’t comment on that. But as a long time gamer I have done many closed and open beta’s for games. So I may have a better understanding of what to expect from a game so early in it’s development. Back in the day (yes I am old, lol) we got clear communication about what was expected of us as test players. Maybe these days that isn’t so clear anymore.\n\nPlaying the game, poking at it to find all the bugs, doing things the devs never expected anyone to try, finding the exploits and so on; these are all our tasks as test players. Even if some players are not really interested in helping the game development, which is fine, it’s still important to play the game knowing the fase it is in. Which again, could be communicated better imho. At least on Switch.\n\nSo perhaps take a break. Come back later when the game is in a state you can enjoy it more. 😀\n\n### Comment ID krgrnb4 with +20 score by [(kyleblane, Reddit, 2024-02-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/1aw5ykc/my_thoughts_on_palia_after_playing_for_3_months/krgrnb4/) (in reply to ID krf5n4f):\n>I feel like this is not made clear when you get the game on Switch though.\n\nJust wanted to confirm that Switch players are never informed the game is in beta, which I think is incredibly deceitful since they also have the premium shop available to them.

This is true and I agree with that. However, where are the patches? Most games I have played that were beta have had a steady stream of patches to fix early stage issues as they are found.

After this market is over they’re switching the patch cadence to every two weeks OR three max as patching games is not like magic and super easy. \n\nIt’s great that you’ve played games that are also in open beta and better at patching, so maybe stick to those! This development team is small. And the amount of petty complaints I’m sure is overwhelming. Especially given that they are a small team. They are doing the best they can. You can go to the official palia website to see a full list of bugs that they’re aware of and it lists what is actively being worked on. \n\nIf you’re unable to bare with waiting a couple weeks as I said I would stick to the games that you feel are better at doing so.

The patch cadence has been updated following the market to bi weekly or three weeks max! If that seems maybe too difficult to wait for or keep up with as I said I would put the game to the side for a couple-few months. They are a small development team, so it’s not easy to fix every single petty bug that people are complaining about. Along with all of the cosmetic complaints and expectations. \n\nIt’s totally okay to be frustrated with an open beta game, that’s usually why people do decide to stop playing and wait a while! And it’s totally okay to do so. \n\nYou can visit their official palia website and see a list of known bugs and it also lists what they are actively working on for fixes. They are very very very transparent and the list is not small. They are fully aware of many of the things you’ve complained here about, and will be working on them! But again as I said, if it’s too frustrating it doesn’t seem worth it to keep playing. And they’re okay with that!\n\n*and to be clear I don’t mean stupid “petty” I mean small “petty” most of the issues that people have are not horribly awful in my opinion- and are just minor bugs, but all anyone can do is wait it out- and If waiting it out isn’t for you or anyone else it’s totally okay to put the game down for a while!

Most of us are probably used to paid games that were completely finished by release. Bugs are unfortunately just the reality. Hell, Cyberpunk 2077 was a mess at first launch because of the bugs and that wasn’t a beta game. We are essentially play-testing this game and helping them find the bugs. \n\nIt can be frustrating when you can’t finish a quest but I like to keep in mind that this game is still in its early stages and there’s always time in the future for those quests.

      "# Post ID 18ewr01: The Temple of Gales vs Disabled Palia Players with +90 score by [(peppermintblue, Reddit, 2023-12-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/)\nIn the September 2023 Dev Update (found at [https://palia.com/news/dev-update-september-2023](https://palia.com/news/dev-update-september-2023)), the following was stated in regards to the obstacle course: *\"Because we don’t want people to feel like this is an experience they have to participate in, we have not put any unique rewards behind completing it that a cozy gamer would feel like they absolutely had to have. E.g. There is no unique plushie locked behind completing this activity. Completing the course is more about earning a sense of accomplishment and being able to show that off than any other reward.\"*\n\nHowever, now in December 2023, they have released the Temple of Gales which is.... the tower in different packaging with both main storyline and unique rewards locked behind it (and like the tower, there are no save points).  \\[edit: you have to complete the temple to unlock the vault bundles which are what actually gives you the unique rewards.\\]\n\nWith the understanding that Singularity6 is not looking at Reddit for feedback, what are your thoughts on this?\n\nPersonally, one of my medical conditions effects my occipital nerve and one of the symptoms is... vertigo.  While it's manageable in Kilima and Bahari, it's not manageable in The Tower or in the Temple of Gales.  I highly suspect it's because those places are in a void where you cannot see the ground/water to help you judge any kind of distance. Just use the persistent center triangle you say? Doesn't work even a tiny bit.  Well what about the adjusting the field of view?  Also does not work, and I have to reinstall my game after any adjustment to it because any change to the field of few results in weirdly unproportionate squished things.Aside from myself, I have seen people taking about being unable to do the Temple of Gales due to  hand problems (Arthritis & Fibromyalgia) as well as due to the in-game instructions not being clear enough for people with cognitive issues (Multiple Sclerosis, Fibromyalgia, and medication side-effects).\n\nI know there were a lot of people, including myself, who submitted feedback to the devs via [support.palia.com](https://support.palia.com) \\> requests > Palia feedback and choosing the accessibility dropdown regarding this when The Tower was released so they could better understand the nature of disabilities that would lock people out of areas such as these... and I won't speak for everyone of course, but from what I am seeing being said, there's a good contingent of the disabled Palia community that is feeling lied to right now.\n\nOf course, rarely will a company ever be perfect in their inclusivity!  However, Palia is doing exactly what they said they would NOT do:  putting unique rewards & storyline behind an area that \\[edit: ~~not everyone can participate in.~~   is like The Tower.  However, my having a disability that is directly challenged by this tower-like new temple is clouding my thoughts on the issue, which is why I'm looking for thoughts on the matter. /edit  -- edit of the edit: Yep, I know that makes the title of the post a little click-baity, but I can't edit it now... sorry not sorry.\\]\n\n## Comment ID kcrxvoa with +20 score by [(Unit-Fickle, Reddit, 2023-12-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kcrxvoa/) (in reply to ID 18ewr01):\nI haven’t played for a few days.

I've never really used a handheld gaming device (smart phone not being counting as a gaming device) before... who knows.  \n\n\n\\--- The following is being copy & pasted into many replies ---  \nThis is an accessibility feedback that I'm submitting right now.  Used other in the choices for accessibility issue feedback:\n\n***General Accessibility Issues***   \n*I couldn't pick just one item off of the list of accessibility because it touches all of them.  There's a pretty extensive Reddit thread about the game that you should probably be aware of, and could likely learn a lot from.*  [*https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the\\_temple\\_of\\_gales\\_vs\\_disabled\\_palia\\_players/?sort=top*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/?sort=top) \n\n*And what it all boils down to is this: Palia has fundamental accessibility problem.  From the lack of colour blindness settings to unique items & main questline being locked behind temples that aren't disability friendly.*     \n*The Palia Code of Conduct (*[*https://palia.com/code-of-conduct*](https://palia.com/code-of-conduct)*)  has the players promise not to be ableist, but the game itself is not meeting that standard as an example.*  *\"According to the World Health Organization, 15% of the world’s population (an estimated 1.1 billion people) identify as having some form of disability. This represents the world’s largest minority, and the only minority group that any of us can become a member of at any time.\"  -* [*https://easterseals.ca/en/disability-in-canada-facts-figures/*](https://easterseals.ca/en/disability-in-canada-facts-figures/) \n\n *Are you willing to loose 15% of your current players, or 15% less of the people you could have playing this amazing game?  Because that's what you may be staring down the barrel of.*  \n *Disabled people do buy premium items.  When we spend a lot of time at home, we do our best to  make the time we spend there as enjoyable as we can.  I love Palia and have bought 3 outfits and a glider skin so far, and I wanted to buy more... but right now my progress in the main storyline is halted because of a lack of an accessibility option...  so why would I buy more?*\n\n *I sincerely beg of you to improve the accessibility options in Palia. Open a better dialogue with disabled players. There are very simple solutions that will make this game an even more beloved experience.*  \n\n*Thank you.* \n\nWe should be flooding their feedback forums. Make more noise.  We shouldn't have to do this, but if we want to be included in this game we may need to do this.   Feel free to copy my feedback if you're not up to writing you own, but you should include your personal experience on one of the specific accessibility issues feedback choices in any capacity you feel you can.\n\n## Comment ID kcqya9n with +33 score by [(RelikaNox, Reddit, 2023-12-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kcqya9n/) (in reply to ID 18ewr01):\nWhen it comes to Palia and accessibility issues, part of me immediately recommends the accessibility discussion channel on the discord... But then, at the same time, I can't in good conscience even do that because it's immediately advertised as not being looked at in the least by the devs.\n\nWorth a good discussion with others that you likely won't get here or on most other channels on the discord, but yeah, it's rough. There's a lot of people who don't realize that accessibility is part of being inclusive. And I can already see that with a quick scroll down in the replies here.\n\nIt might help, at least, to talk to people in the same situation on that channel on the discord, despite the whole issue where they're not...really looking.

The upvote ratio on the main post isn't great... but I did put the word disability in the title, which is enough for many people to downvote on alone.

The new temple was... Really frustrating. I'm the type of person that, once I hyperfixiate on something I HAVE to finish it, but the game itself makes it such a frustrating experience 😭\n\nThere's no mini map. This is already a problem in the open world, but in the temple it was even worse! Yes you get used to it after hours of being stuck there, but I still have problems with getting around, cuz my brain has the memory of a fly. A mini map would REALLY help. We can't even open up a map here under M!\n\nSome stuff isn't explained well or thought out well.\nGetting the evidence for Caleri and Elouisa was really frustrating! While it does check off that you found them, if you're stuck with, let's say two missing for each and being lost in this huge place, you will lose track of whivh you already have unlocked... Maybe after a while there should be hints on where to find the last ones. Or maybe there should be indicators for which you have already found!\nI found myself running to the same ones because I kept forgetting which was for who... I ended up having to use help from the discord (there was this lovely person taking screenshots of the locations, thank you!).\n\nSome of the objects for Zeki's treasure hunt are at awful places (like the gold chapaa figure). It's especially frustrating when the climbing, which is already pretty bugged on the normal map, doesn't work well in the temple at all. Personally I didn't have those huge climbing bugs like others did, thankfully, but the experience itself is not great :( climbing was not really smooth. Sometimes you fall down, slide down, get stuck or invisible walls... Etc etc.\n\nWhile I did have fun the first hour I was playing (in itself I think the temple would be a fun experience), all those frustrating bits keep piling up and make it... Not fun. It wouldn't register the last Elouisa evidence for me so I had to relog, which helped but it kicked me out of the temple and straight to Bahari central stables.. I had to run all the way back 😭\n\nI can't even imagine how this experience must be for someone with a disability. I really hope they can work on this!\n\n#### Comment ID keq0vq0 with +4 score by [(StunningEducation982, Reddit, 2023-12-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/keq0vq0/) (in reply to ID kcrcf44):\nI'm the same way. I also have adhd and hyperfixate and the lack of mini maps is an absolute hell I can't express. \nAnd I'm not sure if this is just a part of the adhd, but sometimes I feel like I have mild dyslexia so I prefer when devs do immersive tutorializing and *showing* the player where to go rather than text tutorials (like in the fire temple where it's mostly visual cues), because I tend to mix up the words anyway.\n\nI tend to like to try finding everything on my own but it was wholly impossible for me. And after watching a YouTube walk-through, I know for sure I would have never found all of the eggs or treasures just based on some of the locations being a sort of \"stand here and turn the camera this way\" optical illusion. Yeah. I have not the patience nor the attention span for that. And my adhd symptoms are compiled with Toddler Mom brain at that 😂 \n\nI think this temple was clever, but maybe not very intuitive\n\n### Comment ID kcr2qgu with +6 score by [(peppermintblue, Reddit, 2023-12-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kcr2qgu/) (in reply to ID kcqznlg):\nYea, buy the time I got through the dialogue for the instructions... I couldn't remember anything beyond finding eggs.  I don't have an ADHD diagnosis yet (did you know that birth control pills mask it? I went off them earlier this year after taking them for over 20 years....  yea.... things are rough right now.... lol), but I absolutely feel what you are saying here.   Only difference for me is that the vertigo is the more immediate problem as I can't look for those eggs when I can't even get off the 1st island.    \n\n\nThere absolutely needs to be be a way to revisit the instructions.  A map would be nice because I could maybe be able to look at my navigation bar at the marker for where I'm going to and how many feet. I could concentrate on that, I like I do when I'm cliff diving in Bahari, rather than on the void and falling.\n\n#### Comment ID kcsotu7 with +3 score by [(GimcrackCacoethes, Reddit, 2023-12-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kcsotu7/) (in reply to ID kcr2qgu):\n\"Did you know that birth control pills mask it?\"\n\nWait, wut?

It did not explain really what we are supposed to be doing, and then I get to the end and I suddenly had quests I didn't really know I was doing in the background of the main egg quest. And now I'm procrastinating going back to find the other things because there is nothing in game telling us where we might be able to find all of these hidden and hard to see items. I will have to scour every inch of those islands to find everything and it feels like a chore.\n\nOther quests do this, too. The language in a lot of dialogues that give you a quest are not very clear. I've had to sort of guess at some things. I did not even know until I went back to them that the statues gave you things for renown. The game does not give us much in the way of telling us what is even going on. Maybe they could make the journal entries for quests way more specific to avoid the immersive dialog.\n\n### Comment ID kcuosl6 with +6 score by [(peppermintblue, Reddit, 2023-12-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kcuosl6/) (in reply to ID kcsribs):\nThe wiki, playthroughs, and asking chat quickly became my friends when it came to doing most of the quests.

My boyfriend, lucky for him, never faced any difficulty climbing, but, I was being stubborn and continued to try, but after a few moments, it was \\*not\\* going to end well. So, I had to call it a day. After they fixed that, I was still having trouble, due to trying to find the books, the treasures, the eggs. There's so much, scattered around \\*so many far flung spaces\\*. No minimap, or even a regular map. Even using guides, you have to watch the guide through, because if something is skipped, you have no idea \\*where\\* a spot is, if they're in a different spot than you are. The area is so darned large, and a lot of spots look so similar. It's also entirely \\*too easy\\* to fall and be sent back to square one... Over, and over, and over.\n\nMy boyfriend got in done in a couple hours, at most. I've been at it for... Six hours, now, I think? Probably more. From yesterday, and today. And I still have one book to find, three treasures, and the final island to explore. I'm taking a break from it because my frustration was getting the best of me, and my body just can't take that.\n\nI am a FFXIV player, who does use accessibility options and I do have friends help me (such as turning off spell effects, having call outs , etc), so I'm used to knocking my head against a wall.

I've been here at least a couple hours, and it stopped being fun. For me, the biggest pain point is the lack of a map to keep track of where I've not been yet, and a lack of tracking where I did find things, so I can quit looking there.

Well, not glad you also struggle, but glad it's not *just* me. It got slightly better for me after one of the recent patches (now I miss about 1 catch in 3 or 4 instead of every other catch), but it's still a struggle to catch many fish... even with the best rod and health boosters on top. Especially the ones with super sudden, unpredictable patterns of movement. Fish that I've seen often and have slower movements I can anticipate a little, but for the other fish... I do *not* have the processing speed or motor coordination to, all at the same time, parse that *and* move the mouse around *and* long-click/release accordingly, for the length of time it takes to reel the fish in. Already submitted feedback to the devs about this exact thing a while back. It's really turned me off of fishing -- My partner loves to go fish for fun, I fish whenever I see a bubble spot on my other errands and ignore it the rest of the time.

If you fall whatever number of  times the option to talk to him about coming up with another way becomes available. You get locked out of the tower for a few palian days while he looks for a solution, and eventually you do a quest to pick up a flow-powered motor of some kind that he puts on your gilder when you meet him back at the temple.  You zip over to whatever without having to parkour.  the motor conveniently breaks right after you you finish turning in all the quest items (so you better find any hidden chests first).   \n\n\n\\--- The following is being copy & pasted into many replies ---  \nThis is an accessibility feedback that I'm submitting right now.

I'm somewhat lucky in the fact that I used to LOVE really hard platforming games (Super Meat Boy, Celeste, etc), so I kind of have that going for me with stuff like this. I still enjoy those sorts of games, but they're harder to do now with the carpal tunnel syndrome. I've still only gotten to just before the end of the third level of The Tower because of it. I'm hoping it's easier to maneuver on the Switch. I opted to just stop trying in the meantime, because it was really stressing me out.\n\nI found that I didn't struggle with the platforming or getting around the temple once they fixed the climbing issue, but I absolutely did have to look up guides to find some of the evidence I was missing for Caleri and a couple of the treasures. I really enjoyed the temple and thought it was beautiful to look at, but it was really easy to get turned around. I hadn't really thought about it until this thread, but I use the wiki CONSTANTLY, because some of that information isn't easily accessible in the game. \n\nFor example, once you catch a bug/fish, it would be helpful to have an in-game almanac that tells you where/when to find it and what bait to use. It would also be nice if the NPC profiles showed you their general likes as well. I like that the weekly favorite items aren't known until you are close enough with them to ask them about it, because that feels realistic to me, and those DO show up in the NPC profiles once you find out what they are. Having stuff to refer back to later, and having more thoroughly explained quest steps would be really helpful, I think. I never really thought about just how often I use the wiki, and that I probably shouldn't have to. That said, I used the wiki with Stardew a fair bit too, particularly for remembering gifts the NPCs liked. I guess I'm just used to using a wiki or guides for most games. I hadn't really considered that it was an accessibility issue, but it's definitely related to my ADHD.\n\nWith regards to general difficulty, I actually really like how Stardew handles fishing. It kind of sucks initially, but as you catch more basic fish and level the skill, not only do you get better equipment, but the actual fishing mechanic gets NOTICEABLY easier. By the time you hit level 10, it's so much more manageable. I don't know that S6 is planning to have any kind of level cap on skills, but given that you get trophies at 25 and 50, I think those milestones would be a good time to implement some kind of buff that slows the fish down and makes them easier to catch, kind of like how sticky smoke bombs slow down bugs. \n\nLike, it makes sense for there to still be at least a little challenge for rarer fish, but some kind of level-based ability to make it easier would be really helpful, especially for people who struggle with the mechanic. I know there are items you can equip with effects that can help with that, but you can only equip one at a time, and sometimes it's more than one issue making the fishing difficult. Like, if you could get a permanent buff that increases both rod health and safe zone size, it would make a big difference, I think.\n\nSpeaking of fishing, is anyone else having the glitch where the reticle is just... Gone? It's not showing up for me, so I've just been trying to match the fish's movements as much as possible, and I keep losing really easy fish, when I can normally catch rare/epic ones without too much stress. It's getting really frustrating. 🙃 I'll have to see if it's on the known issues list and submit a ticket if it's not.\n\n### Comment ID kcz5r8w with +3 score by [(fembecca, Reddit, 2023-12-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kcz5r8w/) (in reply to ID kcuz11q):\nI have that bug, but not all the time.

I have rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, panic disorder, general anxiety, and depression. I also get vertigo really badly from temple situations. Mind you, there's more going on with me. But these are the things that most affect game play for me. I've been using an Xbox One controller to play because keyboard and mouse is simply too difficult to control. I think this makes it a bit easier to manage. But not by much. My hands don't work properly because of the RA and psoriasis. I flat out can't finish this temple. The movements required are too much for me. My anxiety flares up badly too. I had to take my emergency meds on top of my daily meds just to not have a panic attack. Then I feel like a failure because it's something my brain tells me I should be able to do. Which is where the depression comes into play. I'm a mess over this temple. The ables just don't get it.  \n\n\nI get that most solutions that would work for us would suck for the ables. They're the majority so devs always cater to them. Since this is a community minded game, I feel there is an easy solution that wouldn't completely exclude us. If there was a way to \"hire\" an adventurer to run the temple for you. Similar to asking the community for gifts. They get a reward for assisting, we get the temple rewards. Yes I know, this isn't exactly the win we deserve. But it would be a way to get the rewards without having to deal with the headache. I'm at the point in my life where I'm willing to take the small wins where I can get them. Even if it isn't the prize I really want.\n\n### Comment ID kczj8po with +3 score by [(peppermintblue, Reddit, 2023-12-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kczj8po/) (in reply to ID kcy6t0l):\nI have been diagnosed with occipital neuralgia (permanent), trigeminal neuralgia (transient), fibromyalgia  (permanent), and mixed migraines  (permanent)... I'll be working on getting diagnoses in the new year for possible ADD/ADHD (self-test positive), ASD (self-test positive), and CPTSD... so I may not have those exact disorders, or could have false-positive self-tests.  I wanted to share that with you because of your openness about your diagnoses.  <3\n\nI feel absolutely everything you said in your reply.  The feeling like a failure part really resonates with me... I'm just lucky that I'm really good at telling myself that it's a game and this game should not make me feel like a failure because it's supposed to be accessible -- they said it was inclusive. And then having that spin me into a hyper-obsessive advocacy campaign.   At least I am legitimately enjoying the discussion that my post is generating. \n\nThings that make the game accessible for us don't have to suck for the able-bodied.  There can be a small prize for doing it the hard way, because I totally accept that for me to complete certain things in the game is by doing it the \"easy\" way.   If you do it the hard way, reward that with a relatively inconsequential item. I suggest Zeki coins.  They are bought at a high gold cost, but sell for an extremely low amount.  As well, they can get you either a reward that's high value (furniture/plushie), but they can also give you something absolutely useless (non-flare fireworks). \n\nI love your idea of including some kind of system that rewards assisting!  It would really help build the Palia community's multiplayer aspect.  Perhaps some kind of merit points rewarded when you share a resource with other people, and those points could be redeemed for something like... Zeki Coins.     \n\n\nI'm getting bored of small wins and for now I have the drive (it's a miracle) to aim for a slight bigger one.  Even if it's just more transparency.\n\n### Comment ID kcz6chi with +2 score by [(fembecca, Reddit, 2023-12-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kcz6chi/) (in reply to ID kcy6t0l):\nThere's a comment thread somewhere in the early posts that some of us sort of collaborated on regarding a way to make this accessible for many more people.

She is neurodivergent.\n\nIt's hard for people who live normal lives to even imagine it. \n\nAgree that this temple is really not an accessible experience. It's a shame to see.

I'm actually pleasantly surprised.   Maybe that's because I'm reading them with the \"best intentions\" tone though... \n\nYou know, as a formerly able-bodied person... I thought I knew what living with a life-altering disability was like because I worked in healthcare and I knew people with disabilities outside of work as well who were pretty frank about what they go through.    2 guesses how that turned out. \n\nWe could really stand to have more discussions surrounding disability.  If only we weren't already so exhausted from the amount of self-advocating we have to do when navigating healthcare and trying to be seen as actual human beings....\n\n## Comment ID kcucyov with +3 score by [(Kitannia-Moonshadow, Reddit, 2023-12-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kcucyov/) (in reply to ID 18ewr01):\nI ended up waiting for the streamers to do their thing. They created multiple guides already on the new temple where to find things, etc. It helped while it's not a perfect solution it did help me finish it.

As well as medical issues that don't allow my brain and fingers to communicate quickly  \n\nIt's upsetting that sin6 isn't paying attention, but I am hoping the only reason for it is that they are trying to think of how they can do things to be accessible\n\n### Comment ID kcuhju3 with +3 score by [(peppermintblue, Reddit, 2023-12-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kcuhju3/) (in reply to ID kcucyov):\nYes, I am glad there are people making guides.  I definitely go use those if I'm stuck.  I am very hopeful they are working on accessibility options in the background as well, but they need to be more transparent about it if they are.\n\n\\--- The following is being copy & pasted into many replies ---  \nThis is an accessibility feedback that I'm submitting right now.  Used other in the choices for accessibility issue feedback:\n\n***General Accessibility Issues***   \n*I couldn't pick just one item off of the list of accessibility because it touches all of them.  There's a pretty extensive Reddit thread about the game that you should probably be aware of, and could likely learn a lot from.*  [*https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the\\_temple\\_of\\_gales\\_vs\\_disabled\\_palia\\_players/?sort=top*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/?sort=top) \n\n*And what it all boils down to is this: Palia has fundamental accessibility problem.  From the lack of colour blindness settings to unique items & main questline being locked behind temples that aren't disability friendly.*     \n*The Palia Code of Conduct (*[*https://palia.com/code-of-conduct*](https://palia.com/code-of-conduct)*)  has the players promise not to be ableist, but the game itself is not meeting that standard as an example.*  *\"According to the World Health Organization, 15% of the world’s population (an estimated 1.1 billion people) identify as having some form of disability. This represents the world’s largest minority, and the only minority group that any of us can become a member of at any time.\"  -* [*https://easterseals.ca/en/disability-in-canada-facts-figures/*](https://easterseals.ca/en/disability-in-canada-facts-figures/) \n\n *Are you willing to loose 15% of your current players, or 15% less of the people you could have playing this amazing game?  Because that's what you may be staring down the barrel of.*  \n *Disabled people do buy premium items.  When we spend a lot of time at home, we do our best to  make the time we spend there as enjoyable as we can.  I love Palia and have bought 3 outfits and a glider skin so far, and I wanted to buy more... but right now my progress in the main storyline is halted because of a lack of an accessibility option...  so why would I buy more?*\n\n *I sincerely beg of you to improve the accessibility options in Palia. Open a better dialogue with disabled players. There are very simple solutions that will make this game an even more beloved experience.*  \n\n*Thank you.* \n\nWe should be flooding their feedback forums. Make more noise.  We shouldn't have to do this, but if we want to be included in this game we may need to do this.   Feel free to copy my feedback if you're not up to writing you own, but you should include your personal experience on one of the specific accessibility issues feedback choices in any capacity you feel you can.\n\n#### Comment ID kcuiz58 with +5 score by [(Kitannia-Moonshadow, Reddit, 2023-12-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kcuiz58/) (in reply to ID kcuhju3):\nAgree completely.

I didn't even know that I was suppose to turn on the teleport for the other characters until I had completed half the temple, meaning I had to go back to it and do stuff. Not a huge thing but it was frustrating. I luckily haven't really experienced a lot of bugs with climbing, but I do know that for some people it's unplayable because of them. \n\nI do want to ask, as I haven't finished it quite yet as I still have things to find, what unique rewards are there? All I've found are >!treasure chests and the items to give to zeki!<none of which are unique? (perhaps I'm misunderstanding what you mean by unique?) I do get the story aspect though. It's not a deep-dive into lore or anything, but it's still interesting story I wish was accessible without looking it up.\n\n### Comment ID kcrg5st with +7 score by [(peppermintblue, Reddit, 2023-12-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kcrg5st/) (in reply to ID kcra420):\nYou can't complete the vault without completing the temple first.

I understand that is not the case for people with disabilities but if the game was adjusted for possible disabilities it would probably not be very fun for the average player. I hope you find a way to beat the temple of the gales despite your disability. I do hope that they make the temples co-op in the future tho, so that players can party up and help eachother if needed.\n\n### Comment ID kcrt2ge with +9 score by [(Macaron-or-Macaroon, Reddit, 2023-12-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kcrt2ge/) (in reply to ID kcro3p2):\nYes.

You can find 2 satisfying but different ways to complete an area that opens a vault you can donate to to get unique items... especially in a world where flow magic exists and there is a literal character who's main thing is procure flow devices that do fantastical things.\n\n### Comment ID kcyv64u with +1 score by [(ImpressiveElection94, Reddit, 2023-12-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kcyv64u/) (in reply to ID kcro3p2):\nI thought about that, too, but: I think they wanted avoid the problem with possibly having 2 people with different progress.\n\nLike one already opened a door, the other didn't. For the one with closed door, \"opened door-guy\" would look like he's walking straight through it,right?\n\nOr other scenario: You get the progress of one person and the other is just \"accompanying\"? Would be frustrating for the one who doesn'tget the progress, right? And for the ones who cleared it to do it all again might be exhausting, too...\n\nOr kinda bad, too: You get the progress of the one with a clear and the other can just walk past all the puzzles...\n\nThat's what I think.

And when you fall into the abyss, instead of putting you back where you jumped from, it put you back by a portal. Which disoriented me a lot. Add the fact there's no map...  \nClimbing was inconsistent. I'd go over the same ledge multiple times and suddenly, nope. Not this time.   \nI was having a heckuva time finding all the evidence for the sisters and all Zeki's loot, even with a walkthrough because the only distinct island was the one with the orb in front.   \n\n\nI've gamed on PC and game systems, and I can only think of a few boss battles that had me so ticked off and frustrated.  \n\n\nI'd love to have the cloudminnow to display, but thinking of trying to figure out what 4 eggs I missed are...yeah, not anytime soon.\n\n### Comment ID kd75uur with +2 score by [(peppermintblue, Reddit, 2023-12-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kd75uur/) (in reply to ID kczffgz):\nThank you for speaking up about your experience in this particular temple as an able-bodied person.  I'm sorry that you're so frustrated by the area!   The fact that so many non-disabled people are pipping up with the same concerns that are also causing issues for disabled people is validating.  A lot of the time we only get listened to is when non-disabled people pipe up and point out that something really is a problem. \n\nI hope they make modifications to the temple soon so that all of us have a real shot at finishing the area.\n\n## Comment ID kd0mg1g with +2 score by [(Divinora, Reddit, 2023-12-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kd0mg1g/) (in reply to ID 18ewr01):\nI don't have any disabilities that I know of except bad eye sight.

I think the only reason people don't think of bad eyesight (but not blind) as not being a disability is because it's so normalized and is easy to fix with the technology we have. \n\nI'm sorry that you're having so much trouble with the temple.

I've even seen the game as a whole be outright called a platform game more than once in the comments, which is not how it's advertised.\n\nI'm glad you had an easy time with the temple.  I wish they offered an alternative when it comes to main storyline content.  One of the solutions talked about in this thread was that Zeki says something about giving you a Zeki coin on your own... so you go try, but if you fail a number of times you can go back and cop to not being able to do it... then he has to look into a new solution and locks you out of the temple for a number of Palian days... after that, he has you do a quest or something to pick up a device for your glider that will make it so that you can just fly across.     And with that suggestion, can I ask, how would it make someone going across on their own matter less?  They still got more than I would using the alternative questline.  \n\n\nAnd yes, I do agree that it all boils down to capitalism.   Unfortunately, since I became disabled, I have very much learned how capitalism is decidedly un-cozy.\n\n## Comment ID kcrp4vw with +2 score by [(browncoatsunited, Reddit, 2023-12-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kcrp4vw/) (in reply to ID 18ewr01):\nMy problem is that the directions are unclear and I accidentally fell off the main island as was transferred to the end island before finishing the main quest so I am now bugged and unable to complete the quest until s6 fixes it.\n\n### Comment ID kcur9q3 with +1 score by [(peppermintblue, Reddit, 2023-12-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kcur9q3/) (in reply to ID kcrp4vw):\nIf you haven't make sure you submit feedback via [support.palia.com](https://support.palia.com) for the bug, if you haven't thought to do that yet.

I've never managed to complete that but did the temple easily. And I think the majority of players wouldn't have an issue with the temple. That's why they realised that statement with the course,they knew it would be challenging for a lot of people\n\nAs far as disabilities go in an ideal world everyone would be able to play everything, but it's just not realistic. There are many varying disabilities and there has to be a balance between content that will engage the majority player base and bring money in, whilst making it as accessible to as many as possible. If the Devs had to make sure every interaction was something that anyone with any disability could do there wouldn't be much game left.\n\n### Comment ID kcqsvx2 with +10 score by [(peppermintblue, Reddit, 2023-12-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kcqsvx2/) (in reply to ID kcqqyjf):\nIt's great you found it to be easier.  The temple is still a tower-like experience, which is what they said they weren't going to do.   To me, nothing about prior advertising of the game made this out to be a platforming game.  It looks like a Stardew Valley type of game where you cook, fish, hunt, break rocks and use a glider in a place that isn't a void.   \n\n\nI think I made a mistake a the end of my post that makes it read like more of an accessibility issue rather than a \"they said they wouldn't do this and now it's affecting disabled people\" issue.  Because the disabled part is my lived experience, and of course my perception is coloured by it. I'm 100% aware of how unrealistic it would be to be able to cater to all disabilities.\n\n#### Comment ID kcqtu30 with +3 score by [(helen4952, Reddit, 2023-12-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kcqtu30/) (in reply to ID kcqsvx2):\nBut I don't think they have ever said they would never do that. In the patch notes for the obstacle course they say 'We also want to be clear that the Obstacle Course is definitely an experiment we’re trying out — it’s our first attempt on how we want to approach different ways people can play in Palia, and there’s lots of room for us to improve and iterate over time. The Obstacle Course was designed to be bonus content, so there’s no pressure to complete it and you won’t miss out on any big items.'\n\nTo me that implies there is every chance more content like this would be coming. It says there is no pressure to complete the obstacle course, not that there would never be platforming in the main quests. If I've missed something they said somewhere else fair enough but I don't recall them ever saying that. \n\nPersonally I see the only way a game like this can last long term is to introduce completely different types of gameplay over time. Palia in a few years, if it lasts that long, may look very different to how it does now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Comment ID kfhwpwa with +1 score by [(OkamiKhameleon, Reddit, 2023-12-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/18ewr01/the_temple_of_gales_vs_disabled_palia_players/kfhwpwa/) (in reply to ID 18ewr01):\nI just started playing a few days ago on the Switch.

I'm really sad to say but I cant recommend this game anymore since the priority is on the cash shop more then anything else. The game has been buggy and performing poorly for most of it's life and It hard to ignore when they find the time to come up with more and more things to shove into the cash shop.\n\nThis game has charm and is very fun if you are a fan of cozy games similar to animal crossing but want more then just bug catching and fishing. Characters are fun enough and the game is pretty good in the beginning so if you want something new to play its worth considering. The real issue is the lack of things to do, bugs and the lack of quests.\n\nI played this game for hours and almost everyday when I first started but after a point the content just stops and you have to wait for them to drop 1 or 2 new quests for the characters stories and it gets old. Try it if you want but dont expect it to keep its charm for more then 100ish hours.",

During that time, they have made many changes to the game's features to improve gameplay.\n\nYou don't have to pay anything to play, and anything that costs money is purely cosmetic. However, almost every update is about adding more to the premium store, rather than fixing bugs in the game that has been there for months, soon to be years.\n\nI'm giving Palia a positive review because it's a fun game to play, especially with friends. The community is also very helpful so that you can play the game alone and still get help doing tasks where you have to be several people to complete. Just be aware that there are many bugs in the game, and they probably won't be fixed anytime soon.",

          "review": "This game had loads of potential, HAD. I clocked 50 hours fairly quickly when I started playing, it really pulled me in. HOWEVER, the more time you spend in the world the more you see the gaping void that was papered over with a lovely cover. \n\nThere is no depth to the game whatsoever. The relationship system is incomplete so it looks like you can really go places but in reality they never finished it. They also created arbitrary obstructions such as a currency cap, absurdly few crop tiles for farming, and inventory/storage limits. The moment I started seeing how much work has been left unfinished and how these ridiculously limiting factors impacted my game-play, I lost interest. \n\nI stopped playing in December of 2024 and as of this post I returned to the game page to see if any updates have been made. I was not surprised when the only updates that had been made were additions to the games cash shop. At this point, their focus is on making items that people will buy because that gives them profit. \n\nHonestly, the player base is feeding the beast that has destroyed many a promising game. You see, people are buying the overpriced trash that is being added to the cash shop. Each purchase reinforces and further incentivizes the developer to continue prioritizing the cash shop over the actual game. Until players stop rewarding developers in this way, nothing will change and why should it? It is easy money for them to create a few items and rake in the money.",

          "review": "TL:DR: Stardew Valley, Coral Island, My Time At Portia, My Time At Sandrock, the entire Harvest Moon series, Animal Crossing are only a few of the games that not only does what Palia tries to do, but they all do it better and with far more value for your time.  Is it still fun and pretty? Yes, but if you haven't played these other games first I highly recommend playing those games before investing any time / money in this one until it is more developed.\n\nCons:\nThis game is absolutely not in any shape to be selling 30$-50$+ items to its playerbase.  It is very much STILL in early access despite all of the developers, time, and money invested into this game.\n\nIs it pretty? Yes, play Coral Island instead.\nIs it expansive? Not that I've seen so far.  I've only seen 2 playable zones so far. There's another one on the way.  It feels really small to be spending 100s of hours in. Play My Time At Sandrock instead.\nDoes it have enough systems to keep me busy? Absolutely not, play any of the games I've mentioned.\n\nMajor key features it's missing are; \n1. Any sort of individual identity: Coral Island has recycling machines, earths spirits, an entire mermaid storyline and farming system - this game has nothing but knock off night elves from WoW\n2. Ranching: zero animal raising or item collection / processing but still plenty of recipes that require these items which HAVE to be purchased from vendors\n3. Pure Solo Play: players are required for endgame materials.  Yes it's a MMO but it is also a casual game, and a light populated one at that\n4. Extra / Alt characters: you can only make 1 character per account.  You can change your character's appearance for free, however you can never change your character's name\n\nPolitics: This game is riddled with it.  No genders only body type, constant references to the main themes of radical politics as well as cringey slogans being used all over the game, and I could go on.  For me this is a negative, however I'm just presenting this information for people to know before investing their time in the game.\n\nPros:\n1. Graphics are pretty if you enjoyed circa 2007 World of Warcraft Burning Crusade Silvermoon / Blood Elf area.   I appreciated that time period so I did enjoy the graphics.\n2. Ease of Play: Despite low budget looking animations, the controls feel very fluid and fun.  Hunting is my favorite part so far and it is very rewarding and easy to do.\n3. Ease of building / customizing: The building system in this game isn't anything new or special, but it is fun to use.\n\nOverall, it's still too early for me to recommend this game to anyone, despite me putting hours into the game.  It's just not ready yet.  It really needs to implement a travel system (horses / animal transformation for transportation / vehicles / something), some sort of specific identity to explore (mermaid / underwater forms, wings / skyform or farming, something to set it apart), and it desperately needs a thorough ranching system.  Otherwise, I suggest for people to wait until they're ready for a launch.",

          "review": "So. Maybe this is on me, but the trailer and description made it seem like it was a coop adventure/village builder, but it reminds me more of Toontown than anything. There are plenty of good aspects, but they are small compared to the much larger inadequacies of the game.\n\nGameplay: 1/5 - I can see the potential, but there is just no substance. In the early stages you have to wait for hours to build a house because the crafting time in some of your machines are so slow. Farming/gardening is...boring - there is nothing to do. Hunting seems pointless because you can buy everything from a store (thankfully!). The housing plot is ultimately limited in space. The missions have you run around the two large maps JUST to talk to villagers or buy one recipe. Oh, and to return to your housing plot? You either can run all the way back or wait for the 10 minute timer to automatically teleport back. If you teleport, there is a queue so your wait time may be longer.\n\nGraphics: 4/5 - The game is very pretty and cozy. Im sure if you can suffer through the grind of actually building a big decorated house, the game would be astonishingly peaceful. Though, outside the housing plot and the main village(s) there really isnt anything worth looking at. \n\nSoundtrack: 5/5 - I really enjoyed the soundtrack. Its adventurous and inspiring. \n\nOverall: 2/5 - There is something underneath all the grinding you need to do. Im sure eventually the game is all it seems to be - a peaceful home decorating/designing game where you can unleash your creativity and see how your friends build. But to get there...well, it isnt fun. If there was more survival, adventuring, an actual open world, and simply more in depth systems, this game could transform into something great where you can survive and build with friends! But if those arent in the roadmap, thats okay, I'll take my time elsewhere! \n\n\n\n\n",

          "review": "For a game with the multiplayer tag, it doesn't actually do anything with it. You very rarely interact with other players to complete content and it feels more like a solo game with co-op elements once in a blue moon. I didn't really feel invested to keep playing after a couple hours. The world itself felt small and empty, with each map having a hard lock of only 25 players in a zone. This game has yet to be fully released, despite no longer being marked as Early access, so maybe that's the reason why it feels like it's missing something to keep up engagement.\n\nThe characters seemed fine, I liked some more than others but unless I invest some serious grind time into the game I can't say for sure if I have any favourites beyond what they look like. Unfortunately, the game play loop doesn't really feel engaging enough to sink hours into it, and I was left wondering what all my progress was for aside from building furniture and decorating my space. While what's there already is much more in depth than the majority of games you'll see with similar mechanics, it's hard to build a game around that being the only selling point. \n\nNot to mention given that the game is free to play, the developers have stated that the cash shop is their only means of funding the game. While I'm not condemning the presence of the cash shop (as it's a necessary mechanic for ftp games to exist) it does mean that updating the premium cash options take priority over content updates and the items within are very expensive for what they are. There's also no way for free players to gain new outfits or farm the cash shop currency through the game which creates a class system of free players vs cash shop whales and divides the player base (however unintentionally). This also makes Jel, one of the few npc's I was curious about, just a mouthpiece to try and bring you into the premium cash shop. His store is completely devoid of items for players to buy, his comments about having new stock and new designs feel like the devs advertising to players rather than Jel himself, and his store register only opens the cash shop menu, rather than an in game merchant menu like the others. While the cash shop isn't intrusive by any means, knowing that there's no way to customise my character and make them unique outside of spending real life money left a sour taste in my mouth.",

Gameplay feel is very primitive like you are playing a PS2/Xbox/Wii game. They haven't bothered updating the main story in a year while being in early access for 2 years. Also the premium store is like 10 pages long with basic outfits costing 40 dollars, please make it make sense. Community is still riddled with toxic positivity and will jump on you if you have any critiques of their comfort game. They added a mechanic to let you grow rare resources at your in-game home but people will still curse you out for chopping the tree that they and their friends were claiming.",

          "review": "I used to really love Palia, especially because it's free to play and seemed extremely player rich. I enjoyed the game for a few months and even spent quite a bit of cash on it to support the devs, but then things began to get worse over time. Here are my main issues with the game:\n\nThe romance options are great and they have even opened up some new candidates over time per the players requests, but you never actually get to go on an of the dates with any of the characters. They always find some excuse and then you end up running around doing a minor quest to help them out and make them like you more. This happens with every single candidate, and you never really get to do anything out of the usual. It's a little disheartening considering part of the cozy aspect of the game is to date/romance characters. I found it to be extremely disappointing.\n\nThe glitches were something that were always present, but as time went on and promises of fixing them, they only seemed to get worse. More and more bugs cropped up, lots of them being the exact same issue from a previous patch that they swore they fixed. This leads to the game being unplayable, as certain quests and weekly gifts are cooked meals and when an ingredient is glitching or something isn't working, you can't complete it and essentially have to wait for the developers to fix it. Usually, I am very patient about this, but the issue is that the bugs aren't being fixed at all. They claim they are, but never seem to fix anything that is a real problem. This leads me to my biggest gripe about Palia and it is the way that the developers are deciding to handle the criticism of their inconsistencies. When told about triggering seizures due to the glitching, their response was that they were going to fix it asap due to concern for their player base. When they essentially told these players they fixed the issue, and very obviously didn't, they were politely confronted only to get upset and tell players to \"give them the benefit of the doubt\" in spite of their previous promises to actually fix the issue. I find that to be irresponsible, and frankly untrustworthy when they could just be upfront about their struggles to fix visual settings or toggle to turn off the visuals that will cause these seizures.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't say it's a terrible game, but I personally cannot support devs who do not care about their player base and continue to act unprofessional in the face of problems they themselves have created. If I could go back and never put any money into the game, I would in a heartbeat as things are far too expensive for a game that doesn't actively fix bugs and in-game issues that make it unplayable from week to week. I may reconsider in the future if they ever address their poor communication with people in the disabled community and their lack of bug fixes, but otherwise, I have to be upfront about my experience and it wasn't good.",

Gathering materials doesnt feel like a chore. Theres so much to do, even when you have to wait around for ores to smelt or wood to cut, you can go play minigames in the sewers or befriend the villagers. \r\nThe concept of hunting bugs and animals is really neat as well. Most games will have you fighting monsters or running for your life. But here, theres no danger. The game goes as fast as you want it to, and theres no rush to do anything. its just a nice casual place to be. \r\nI just finished building my first house and now I can't wait to do all the customizations. Building furniture and learning new recipes whilst doing so is a great concept to be implemented. I look forward to where Palia takes me!",

I like having the ability to fish , hunt  muujin. sernuk ,and chappa, not to mention all the bugs. You can also mine, garden, cook, forage  create and design homes and plots into magical places  that inspire others. The quest and interacting with the NPC's are cool.  If you like cozy games this one is by far one of my favorites and now I play this exclusively. I am addicted.",

Yes, you have to grind levels and materials, but if you didn't have to, it'd be boring because you'd have your farm and house immediately. It feels like there is more payoff when you level up and earn different recipes or items for purchase. There are little nuances to the crafting and while it might seem annoying, I ended up liking how they work. The game is a bit buggy, but it's free and clearly made with love. I bought some outfits in the cash store because wow they are adorable and I wanted to support the game.The NPCs are so cute! I really enjoy getting to know all of them and progress their relationships. The romances are very sweet too! I like that the game makes you work with other players because I'm very shy and I've slowly gotten used to speaking to people on the server to let them know what resources I've found. Give this one a chance and take your time. Put headphones on to really enjoy all the ambient sounds.",

For a free game, it's worth it, and I haven't noticed any pay-to-win mechanics yet even though I'm about halfway through most of the skills. The in-game community seems very nice too, it's an MMO that encourages cooperation and even friendliness in the loading screen flavor text, and that seems to be working out well.",

Music is delightful, characters feel fleshed out (which is impressive for the number of NPCs), graphics are pretty great. A little buggy (NPCs sink into the ground only to pop up to normal a few steps later and can't be interacted with while on bridges) but nothing game-breaking. I've been playing with my husband and we haven't had any difficulties. The Party Bonus is also a nice touch, and you can always see where your party members are if you're in the same server. For a free game, this is a ridiculously good game. You don't HAVE to spend real world money if you don't want to, anyone who says otherwise is just easily jealous/wants the extra pretty things. These developers need money somehow, and for a free game, the prices are reasonable and - again - optional. Highly enjoyable game and quickly becoming my favorite new game.",

The gameplay loop, while not groundbreaking, offers a relaxing and cozy experience with a focus on decorating and building your dream .. farm home, I guess. While the repetitive nature can set in after a while, the game provides a variety of activities to keep you engaged, from fishing and bug catching to gardening and interior design.\n\nOne divisive aspect is the cooperative harvesting of higher-tier materials. This encourages social interaction and teamwork, adding a refreshing layer to the gameplay. However, solo players might find this mechanic a bit limiting at times.\n\nOverall, Palia is a fun and charming game that delivers on its promise of a cozy and relaxing experience. Despite some minor drawbacks, I recommend giving it a try, especially if you like a good cozy vibe game and decorating a home.",

          "review": "This game isn’t really for solo players looking to just kick back and play on their own — it’s much more rewarding when you have support from friends. There are plenty of items and tasks that require two or more people, so if you’re going it alone, it'll be impossible to progress the main quest after the first few. However, if you’re someone who loves being part of communities, joining Discord servers, and making new friends, this is the game for you! You don't need your current friend group to play it with, there's sooo many discord servers and people wanting to make friends. If you don't necessarily want to make friends, you can still message in server chat your coordinates on the map and someone will come by and help you farm items you can't do alone, or you can request 4 items per day that you need and people will fulfil your request.\n\nIt’s hands down the cosiest, no-combat game I’ve ever played. The quests aren’t overly challenging but still enjoyable, and there’s always something to do, from cute events to decorating and designing your housing plot. Even though I’m usually not a fan of farming games, this one is super fun and easy to get into. You don't have to worry about fall damage, villagers sleeping (even though they sleep you can still go to their door and speak to them!). There's not much you can't do, it's still a grind, not an easy run, but an enjoyable one!\n\nThat being said, there are still a fair number of bugs, like items in buildings sometimes becoming invisible or villagers appearing underground at your plot, which can be a bit annoying. You’ll likely need to restart the game to fix these issues. But it’s still a fairly new game, so I’m sure these bugs will be ironed out over time and don't really take away from the experience as they're quite minor. \n\nOne thing I’d love to see in the future is a shop for different hairstyles to make character customisation a bit more detailed. I’m a big fan of character creation, so more options to customise your avatar would be a great addition!\n\nWhat really stands out, though, is the community. I’ve joined 'cooking parties' in game from Discord, which help level up your cooking skill and earn money in the game super fast. The people are incredibly kind, helpful, and generous. It’s honestly one of the best gaming communities I’ve been a part of. If you’re into making friends and love a chill, cosy vibe, this game will become your new favourite! \n\n*TL;DR*: Great game for those who enjoy teamwork and community! Solo players may struggle past the early quests, but there are plenty of Discord servers to make friends and get help. It’s a cosy, no-combat game with fun quests and relaxing housing design. Some bugs like invisible items and villagers underground exist, but they’re minor and likely to be fixed. A character customisation shop for hairstyles would be a great addition. The community is friendly and helpful, making it perfect for those who love a chill, social vibe!",

          "review": "A joyous online farming/crafting sim that is relaxing, entertaining, and beautiful. \nKey features:\n1) Co-op. You can choose to travel alone, but it is more worth while with friends. So far the community is supportive and kind.\n2) Story. I have yet to finish the main story, but it has been entertaining.\n3) Characters. Diverse and interesting with their own personalities. Work to befriend them with gifts, daily chats, and quests. Romance available.\n4)Skill growth. The skill growth spans several areas: farming, hunting, mining, crafting, fishing. It keeps you moving and sets reasonable goals.\n5) Farming. The farming sim is reliable and easy, yet with challenges that get easier as you level up your equipment and skill. Plenty of plants to offer, and the upgrades are worth it.\n6) Fishing and bug catching. Easy with it's own challenges. A wide array of fish and bugs that vary depending on location, time, and equipment. You can display star quality ones in your home.\n7) Foraging, hunting, and mining. Similar to other games with a rarity level and the equipment to match. Tools become available to help ease the process, and friends make it easier.\n8) Cooking and crafting. Unlock an array of recipes as well as equipment to keep your focus up (your energy so to speak that impacts the exp earned). Cooking with a group proves more rewarding.\n9) Build your house and share with others. You buy writs and crafter rights at the town hall to expand your home. Set your home in a tour for others to see and view and rate other homes. Doing all of this gains you rewards. The building mechanism is good, but could use improvements. You can buy house expansions from the town hall, and additional buildings. Easily moved. You can purchase recipes for building blocks to build, and these lock together for easy movement. You can grow trees and flowers to place, and, as noted earlier, you can place tanks with bugs and fish! See cons for minor irritants.\n10) Customize your character with clothing, hairstyles, hats, and pets. The character customization is easy and seamless. \n\nPalia is free, though there are in-game purchases you can make to support them.\n\nCons (my personal take):\n1) Probably one of my largest annoyances is the inability to group move many items on your plot. You can work around this by stacking on movable items, but if you want to plant a ton of flowers in grass? You had better want them where they are!\n2) Glitches. Some of the glitches can be annoying and frustrating, but overall they are few and the devs are active in corrections.\n3) Night doesn't get dark enough in my opinion. I know it's silly, but I like the challenge of creating light.\n4) Although I appreciate the no time limit, not resting for energy seems...odd. Almost like cheating.\n5) Interaction with pets. I mean, they are cute, but that's it. Nothing but following you around. I would like to see at the minimum petting interaction! Skills and leveling would be great!\n6) No mounts. But there is a cart system. Yet there is a lot of running around.\n7) No weather changes. I always appreciate this in farming Sims, but also can add additional challenges.\n\nI highly recommend this game, and if you enjoy it ass well as I do, then remember to support the dev team. <3\n",

There's also a variety of things to do while waiting for about half an hour for a medium room to be completed or 5 minutes for 1 iron bar. Chopping trees could be an option but keep an eye out for random bugs and even wolves that spawn from the ground! true magic! Also i get it, its a free game but the prices on the cosmetics are ridiculous. This game could be so good if it needed less grind and then you would be able to actually enjoy the story. Still gonna recommend this though because it has potential. ^^",

It super fun to run around and meet all the interesting characters while following along a fun and intriguing plot. In the meantime while you complete the story you get to build a home base and learn to cook, garden/farm, fish, etc.. So many fun things! You also get to play with people all over the world and everyone is so nice and helpful when you are out getting resources. The creators are very generous and are always working to update the game as well as sending out little free gifts to players. The only time you spend real life money is if you want any special outfits/skins/pets but even those are very reasonable seeing how the game is free and that is how they keep the lights on. If you don’t want to spend money they do give you a free pet and most f the clothing is actually really cute! There are tons of great videos on YouTube as well on how to get started in Palia like the lingo and “unspoken rules” of the game so when I started, I was feeling pretty comfortable but greeted and helped by all the players and even still to this day am.  I get lost in this game for hours and highly recommend it!",

The level of difficulty of them are FAR BEYOND the limits of what is enjoyable in a relaxing, casual game. I feel like I'm playing Myst, attempting to do all these puzzles. I'd love to just ignore these quests, but it unlocks other quests. SO, SO frustrating that I may stop playing. Please figure out a way to fix this.... I see in the statistics for these quests that only 2% of players have completed them. It's out of balance.\n\nI think this game could be amazing if the Main Quest issue is fixed. No one wants a game that it too hard to play.",

If you want a casual, slightly grindy (if you're competitive) and no-pressure game of farming and rich NPC interactions, go for a try or two. \nThere are events throughout the year so maybe play during those timings for different experiences. Personally, I only play to escape from the stress of work and commitments.\nIt's also available on Switch, which you can play on the same account. Have fun if you can!",

I think it is a great game, for those who like animal crossing or medieval dynasty. It has had so much effort and time put in, & the amount of options for decorating are incredible. To the complaints I would only say this- the game is free! I would pay $40- $50 for it (I am used to PlayStation & Nintendo prices). In fact I spent money on skins because I felt so guilty not paying anything for the experience. \r\nWhat I love:\r\nThe number of options for furniture/decorations.\r\nThe number of different plant-ables (flowers).\r\nThe monthly markets.\r\nThe NPC storylines are great (the Subira ones worried me a bit, but they turned out well).\r\nI like that they add new plots & new areas, some of the other games I have played kind of end & having fresh content means I can play for longer.\r\n\r\nWhat I would alter:\r\nI would love to see what is in Tamala's store & have potions.\r\nI like having symmetry in my veggie patch, please add another soil slot, or have say 8 veggie/berry slots & then when you hit higher levels allow 2-4 \"tree only\"soil plots.\r\nI find it weird that the apple tree \"dies\", it would be better that it is planted once on a \"tree only slot\"and then just gives apples every 5-8 days rather than having to keep replanting it.\r\n\r\nWhat I would add:\r\nI would love an extra colour option in the furniture makeovers (something like black/white/wooden look). \r\nI would like some long skirts, there are a lot of short skirts and jeans etc.\r\n\r\nThink it is great, full credit to the devs for this :).\r\n",

I love this feature! I used to stress getting everything done in Stardew Valley but this removes that stress. Don't get me wrong, I love the grind in Stardew but Palia is definitely a lot more laid back.\n\n[h3]PARTY UP![/h3] \n3. Just send a server-wide message and someone will take you up on it. It is so much faster to farm because being in a party allows you access to each other's loot as long as you stay in close proximity of each other. This includes ores, foraging, hunting, etc. You gain money faster which will help you buy the bigger backpack and ammo storage.\n\n4. I love the community and how all players support each other. There is a donation system where each player can ask everyone in the server up to 4 items per day. \n\nThank you devs!!",

I have limited mobility so really enjoy taken the time going round this colourful world, The MPCS in the game are very well done, just love  Zeki  and even moany Hassian  I find it a very pleasant people game, I cannot read the chat in game, but it hasn't spoilt my enjoyment of the game, well done to all who helped making the game and I'm looking forward to Elderwoods, what will we discover in there.",

Latest update as of writing this for example, adds a few decorations for F2P and then barrages you with paid only items and a FOMO paid login rewards program. On release this game had everything it could ask for, only for them to get greedy, fire half their workforce and demand its customers foot the bill. Disrespectful and common in this industry nowadays.\n\nEdit: hours played only account for steam, switched late into game-play.",

I love the building system, the style of the objects, the grid system, etc. The characters are well written, but dialogue becomes cycled fairly quickly with very little updates to their story-lines/personal development. \r\n\r\nI play on PC, but the graphics for Switch are ATROCIOUS not to mention the bugs!! In my opinion, it's not ready for early access even after almost a year of being playable on steam. Every update breaks the game to the point where it's unplayable.\r\n\r\n There's still quests that are so bugged, you can't get through them without contacting support and yet they keep adding expensive cosmetics to the game. How many $20 dollar outfits does this game need before it fixes core issues? I have no problem with cosmetics, but it's bordering on EA levels of over-monetization for a game that isn't worth the money. The free clothing options are ugly as hell, ad the cosmetics are overpriced. The dwindling player count speaks for itself honestly. I love this game and the little world of Palia but mismanagement and greed ruin it for me. I'll still log in to decorate here and there but I'm not invested like I was when I first started playing and that's unlikely to change.",

I love that humans are considered almost mythical and here your character pops up out of nowhere and the entire community of non humans is so curious about your character. The only thing that's meh about this game is the grind for materials. The crafting is amazing, gathering the materials, especially the more rare ones is tedious, especially when it's a 5:1 or better ratio. Also the interaction/friendship aspect goes a little slowly. It's almost like you can grind the friendships to get them to where you need them for certain quests, or you can grind materials...there doesn't feel like there's a good balance there yet. Overall though, a nice game, good for when you want to get into a game and lose track of time but easily enough to stop where you're at and come back to reality.",

One thing I really enjoy about the game is the character creation however. I will give it a 5/10 just because every outfit is 20+ dollars. An MMORPG like FF, BDO, WoW or anything like I can see since the playerbase is so massive. But for a mainly singleplayer game its a bit much. I get its a new game and the devs are trying to build the community and such which takes a huge amount of money; but to have the most boring clothing and all the nice clothing purchasable is killer to me. Why not make some pieces of clothing craftable or obtainable through certain missions?",

Character creation is really good, the in game relationship system is a favorite, I love the resource gathering aspect of it, inventory/map/quest log etc are all easy to navigate which is great. I love the different areas you can explore and all the little achievements you can get playing.\r\nFor the things I dislike starting off with 1. Storage. Stacked items take up way more space then I was expecting. Rather then a stack of 20 wood taking 1 spot in your storage chest it is actually taking up 20 of your spots even when stacked/condensed which gets really annoying when you're trying to build up your resources. \r\n2. Crafting items feels super unbalanced in the way that each item requires a ton of resources which is a lot of time gathering, time refining, storage space all for one item. Some crafted items also just feel pointless. For example, you can craft repair kits for your tools when you upgrade them to keep them at max power. Each crafted kit gives you 20 kits which I assumed 1 kit = full tool life. WRONG. If your tool is nearing the end of its upgraded life its going to cost all if not more then your 20 kits to fix which feels insanely unbalanced. Makes \"upgrading\" your tools feel more like a \"downgrade\" and an expensive chore to keep up on.",

          "review": "Still relatively new to the game with only around 230 hours at the time of this review. The game is still being developed with updates being implemented.\n\nThis game is not designed to rush from the start to end, someone can min/max, stress to hit every event and rush all the time to try and squeeze in every aspect of the game each time it comes around but that was not what it was designed for.  This is a cozy game which is focused on a relaxing game-play. An in-game date is matched to a real world hour.  So if you miss something you can just get it again an hour later.  The day cycles are not designed to be a FOMO, just to allow a variety of events to take place throughout the in-game day such as rotating fish or bugs during select hours as well as NPC's go about their lives and work, socialize and sleep too.  The designer of Palia included that you can still interact with the NPC's even if they are sleeping at time so your never really missing out. \n\nSome peoples comments that they feel that gold becomes the bottleneck to slow down play and that is somewhat true.  It is more difficult in the beginning to earn gold as you are learning the game, improving your tools, expanding your housing plot(s) and more. If you mainly want to just unlock things you can focus on the main quest line. If your not in a rush however there are side quests, discoverables, story lines that expand the games lore and flushes out the NPCs. Just about any game has progression to keep the game moving and interesting.  This is a free game with the option to purchase cosmetics if you opt to do so but it is by no means required. In general the community has been positive, helpful and considerate to events working as groups.  The game rewards playing together but does not takeaway from playing solo if you have a preference game play style.",

The drop rate of trees from the guldor statue for flow seedlings... one every 24 hours is a little harsh when you're working on a big project that has those designs in place. I have yet to get all 4 flow seeds and i have been trying for 2 months now. \r\n\r\n2. The decoration limit of 3k. I know they're working on that, so I hope to see more in the future as a LOT of the items offered are small, which means you can use a lot of them",

The game offers a welcoming, positive community where players are genuinely helpful and supportive. I believe the developers' main goal is to create a space where creativity can thrive and players can collaborate freely.\r\n\r\nI absolutely love the game's depth. From building your own house to farming, cooking, and crafting, every activity contributes to your skill progression. There's so much to explore and enjoy that it's hard to know where to begin!\r\n\r\nThat being said, the game isn’t perfect. My only criticism is the chat function, which tends to bug me out of the game from time to time. Additionally, the Mujins look a bit off when you're cutting down trees, but these small issues don't detract from the overall enjoyment of the game.\r\n\r\nPalia is a charming and immersive experience that stands out in a crowded genre. I can't recommend it enough!",

          "review": "Its a free to play cozy game that still has adventure, while you don't go killing monsters (not that I would mind killing monsters) there are still challenges, quests, and adventures. Palia is in a category of its own. You can design your own house and decorate how you want in whatever style you choose. You can make food, farm, hunt, fish, and even friend and date npcs. I was never interested in stardew valley or animal crossing. I don't really play cozy games but I must say Palia is a vibe. \r\n\r\nThat being said while I do like the game and its lore a lot I do not like the co-op aspect in that you are required to work with others for certain resources. Its hard for me to talk to others one on one and/or ask for help when most people don't even talk in chat, just because someone is helpful doesn't mean they want to be friends. Don't get me wrong some talk and seem friendly and if you ask a question you're likely to receive an answer but I also feel like I'm on someone else's time when in a group unless I know the people well. I don't want to rush because someone is waiting and I don't want to make others feel rushed because I'm waiting. And some days its just hard to ask for help. It's not that I'm anti social you'll see me talk in chat its more that I'm awkward social and don't want to feel forced to make friends.\r\n\r\nThere's unique crafting in the game as well but I wish used items you no longer want had a better use than to just be tossed, maybe like a revert system, even if you lose some materials, or a lower sell price, auctioning even. \r\n\r\nAlso, it would be neat if you could design or even craft cosmetics or outfits though I'm not sure that's a thing. (Still learning things) You can change your look and beginner outfit for free and as often as you want but there's nothing else unless you buy it which I get, they gotta make money to run the game somehow, but I wouldn't mind a few pieces of craftable clothing and cosmetics here and there. I feel like I don't have a personality because there's nothing on my person that's unique lol\r\n\r\nAll in all very good game would recommend 8/10.

I like that there are secrets to unravel, plenty of things to craft and collect. Decorating your home is fun. The game's genuinely free, they don't bug you to buy stuff all the time but I ended up buying a few cosmetic things just because I love the game so much and wanted to support them.

          "review": "Palia is a charming life sim with a lot of potential. The world is visually stunning, and the character customization options are extensive. I've enjoyed exploring the different areas, completing quests, and interacting with the friendly villagers.\r\n\r\nOne of the highlights is the in-depth decorating system. Players have a lot of freedom to customize their homes with a wide variety of furniture, decorations, and even landscaping options. This allows for a high level of creativity and personalization.\r\n\r\nHowever, some aspects of the game can be frustrating. Collecting certain plushies, particularly the rare fish and hunting ones, can be quite challenging and time-consuming. The drop rates for these items seem low, which can be discouraging.\r\n\r\nOverall, Palia is a promising game with a lot to offer. The charming world, engaging characters, and extensive customization options make it a relaxing and enjoyable experience. However, some aspects, like the difficulty of obtaining certain collectibles, could be improved.\r\n\r\nKey Strengths:\r\n\r\nBeautiful visuals and a charming world.\r\nExtensive character customization options.\r\nEngaging decorating system with a wide range of furniture and decor.\r\nFriendly and engaging NPCs.\r\nAreas for Improvement:\r\n\r\nDifficulty of obtaining certain plushies, particularly fish and hunting ones.\r\nSome aspects of the game can feel repetitive.\r\nOverall:\r\n\r\nPalia is a fun and relaxing life sim with a lot of potential. Despite some minor drawbacks, it's a game that I've enjoyed playing and look forward to seeing how it evolves in the future.\r\n\r\nNote: This review reflects my personal experience and may not represent the views of all players.",

The romance options are fun, wish they were a little more in depth personally but I'm 100% a critic on that front, so disregard that bias. Without a doubt worth looking into and downloading. I can only explain this game like the following; if Animal Crossing met Stardew Valley, then had a child and that child met Legend of Zelda and had a child. This is that second child.

It’s open-ended, relaxing, and somehow still packed with so much to do! The quality is insanely good, the art style is beautiful, and the gameplay is just perfect. It’s one of those games that pulls you in, and before you know it, hours have passed.\r\n\r\nThere are so many quests, and I love how every skill, whether it’s hunting, fishing, cooking, or foraging—feels meaningful. Upgrading your tools and progressing takes time, but that just makes everything feel so rewarding. And the decorating?? Don’t even get me started! There are SO many options, and I could literally spend hours just making my home look cute.\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite parts is the party system because you actually grow and level up together. Playing with friends makes everything even more fun, and it feels like you're always working toward something. It’s just such a cozy, immersive world that I never get tired of.\r\n\r\nAlso, I HAVE to mention the cosmetics, yes, they’re expensive, but honestly?? They are SO pretty and beautifully designed that I don’t even mind spending my money on them. Every outfit and accessory looks amazing, and I already know I’m going to be buying way too many! \r\n\r\nThe Palia community! Calling them nice and welcoming is AN UNDERSTATEMENT!!! They are sooo nice, always helpful, and just make the game even better.\r\n\r\nIf you love games that let you explore, chill, and customize every little thing, Palia is 100% for you. Even in beta, it’s already amazing, and I can’t wait to see how it evolves. Easily one of my favorite games right now! ❤️\r\n\r\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 10/10",

I partially don't like it though because there is no PVE combat(I personally hate PVP). If there were some PVE combat, similar to what Stardew Valley has, then I would give this game 10/5 and 1000/100! At least an optional \"dungeon\" or cave instance that you don't NEED to complete but you *can* complete for some extra stuff would suffice. That way players can choose to do it. So for those who just want the farming sim, they can still have that without combat. Then for those who like to play it all, farming AND combat(PVE not PVP), an instance or cave with some monsters you can kill with a bow or sword would be an excellent(and welcome) addition to the game. Probably would sell more copies too! Especially since there is some talk about forging weapons by NPCs, why not have some PVE action in there too?\r\n\r\n I got this game thinking there was some sort of combat. Like a 3D Stardew Valley and I was so excited. Then I saw a comment about how there is no PVE combat and I immediately lost interest. At least make it an optional feature. Id like to refund the game otherwise, please.",

I thought that it was a really charming game, and that it would rot my brain for the next 100 hours but then my axe broke. \n\nI expected that it would simply not work, since I had gone through the necessary steps to upgrade it.. But I had to reupgrade it and it downgraded. People have mentioned that having to grind out resources is a problem.. It is. Having to find and grind out the individual ores is a CHORE, and maybe it's better with the community, but I shouldn't have to struggle because I like playing and doing things on my own. \n\nAfter 27 hours and my axe broke I was so annoyed that I had to gather all of my things, re-smelt them (which isn't instant.. it takes time like a mobile game would) and then i could go toward that next upgrade I was working on. It's annoying that there's no automated resource gathering for things you've already gotten and it's frustrating and punishing. I stopped a while ago, but it seems this is still an issue and that's really unfortunate.",

If not for that one issue, it would probably be one of if not my favourite game ever.\nFirst things first, the game overall is perfect. The graphics are great, the gameplay feels smooth and enjoyable, the soundtrack and atmosphere are top notch, the story is super immersive and the characters all have deep personalities and their own stories to explore. Everything in this game is done perfectly, it's just an amazing and very emotional experience, that you can enjoy along with a great, kind and very active community.\nYet, after not even 60 hours of slow gameplay, i finished the main questline, all the active side questlines and all the character questlines that interested me. I didn't have a single active quest. I started grinding fishing and bug catching for the night sky temple, which was much tougher than other quests but still really fun, and did some tiny quests that appeared along the way. Yet, after a while i just realised that i'm chasing something that's not there. The game was super enjoyable, fun and immersive but after finishing the main questline which turned out to be much shorter than i expected and i REALLY took my time completing it, the game turned to me searching for something to do cause i was too attached to the experience.\nTechnically in game it says that this is still a beta, but the steam store page showing it as a full experience is just misleading. Even though the only microstransactions are purely cosmetic, i still imagine that someone who payed for some cosmetics after seeing how great the game feels would be disappointed after realising that the game feels more like a demo than a finished, long term mmo experience.\nIt would be an amazing game that i would spend my money on, if it had at least 20x more content.\nAt this state, it's still worth playing because it's free, but prepare to be disappointed.\nI love this game and it pains me to say it, but it's not worth getting into cause all you're gonna end up with is a bitter aftertaste and a thirst for something that was never there.",

I am slowly learning all the npc's and really enjoy them all. I can't wait until I am able to explore the romance aspect of the game as well. The only complaint I really have is that none of the furniture is actually functioning. I can't sit in the chairs I've crafted nor am I able to use the bed, which I think would be a fun feature (though probably hard to accomplish since it is an open world game)",

However, with that being said the game play and controls ( I use a ps5 controller to play on my pc. It's just more comfortable personally ) are slightly difficult for me to follow. Besides this minor setback, i do enjoy the game!  I'm still learning how the game works but i would 10/10 recommend it for sure! :)",

You have only two ways of earning money basically and all you do is grinding same things all the time. For some things you even have to count on other players if they help you out or not. But not only that disappointed me. I was really looking forward to winter time in Palia because i just love winter seasons in games and i thought i will see pretty view of snow and decorations everywhere. But that didn't happen. You could see snow in some places but it looked as if it just melted, no winter atmosphere at all.\n\nI'm really disappointed but i still hope maybe in the future we will have more things to do in here.",

Gathering is rather on meh side , animations are just terrible . For certain amount of time you can play by your self and then you need other players to gather end game materials ( which is extremely stupid design ) . Story is fun for about 1st 5-6 quests and it becomes bland . More efforts went to cash shop the to the game as there is so many minor bugs which could have been fixed anytime but no , devs keep adding more packs of cosmetic junk to cash grabbing shop then actually doing anything for the game . After a while game becomes very repetitive , boring , as there is not much to do , all there is to tend to your crops and keep gathering materials and thats that for entire game . oh and as you get higher tier tools , it feels like their made out of paper as you need to fix them every 2 min .",

          "review": "I get this game is in BETA, but a quick review;\r\nPros:\r\n-Cutesy graphics\r\n-Mind numbingly chill\r\n-Simple\r\n-It's the MMO version of Harvest Moon (that alone wins me over)\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n-Extremely feminine character designs for the player (all the hair types are for chicks, or look like you do same relations for dudes corn (IYKYK)\r\n-Literal game breaking bugs \r\n-Infuriating friendship system\r\n-Frequent rubberbanding\r\n\r\nThe rate the game breaks (unable to swap weapons, unable to interact with NPCs or workstations, unable to do basic actions like climbing) is unreal. Yesterday alone, I had to have restarted a solid 4-5 times. This is worse on the Switch (do yourselves a favor and wait till a stable release if you want to get it for switch). \r\n\r\nWhen designing me character, I could not find a decent haircut for males. They all look so feminine and extremely...... yeah, (IYKYK) I mean, they use body type A and B so this isn't really a surprise. \r\n\r\nThe whole friendship thing into romance thing is just slow. You climb friendship slowly, and is timegated. It looks liked they took a page from Blizzard. \r\n\r\nBiggest thing I think it's missing is a collections page. Seeing what fish you've caught, what bugs you caught, crops harvested, and so on. \r\n\r\nThe rubberbanding makes me think I'm plating LoL for the first time when it released. \r\n\r\nBut, I will give credit where credits due. If they remove the Type A - B body types, and added some additional hairstyles that suit the male body frame, thats a bonus (and something that gamers want). \r\nThe biggest thing that needs to be looked into is the game breaking tool bugs the most though. Easily replicated, and if they wanted to hit me up with the steps to replicate it, happy to supply (I legit could not find a bug report form). \r\nThe graphics as a whole are cute, but a lot do look ripped right from Fortnite (environments and housing), not going to complain about that, I do personally like that design. \r\n\r\nAs soon as they fix the game breaking bugs, Ill swap to a hell yes recommendation.",

The charming world and intriguing lore provide a relaxing backdrop for building a home and forging friendships (and maybe even romance) with the diverse NPCs.

I think that the game is very fun i would recomend for everyone.",

The game's blend of crafting, cooking, and farming is a joy to experience, and the ability to share these activities with friends adds a layer of warmth and community that's hard to find in many games. The developers have clearly put a lot of love into creating a world that feels alive and inviting, with each character and location having its own unique charm.\n\nWhile the game is still in its early stages, the potential is immense. The developers have shown a willingness to listen to the community and make meaningful changes, which is a breath of fresh air in the gaming industry. The graphics are stunning, and the attention to detail in the world design is impressive. The game's focus on exploration and discovery is a highlight, with each new area offering something new to see and do.\n\nHowever, there are areas where Palia could improve. The game's progression system can feel a bit grindy at times, and the lack of a robust multiplayer experience can be a letdown for those looking for a more social gameplay experience. The premium store, while not intrusive, could be better balanced to ensure that players feel rewarded for their time and effort, rather than just their wallet.\n\nDespite these minor drawbacks, Palia is a game that I find myself returning to time and time again. It's a perfect blend of relaxation and challenge, and the sense of community is something that's truly special. I'm excited to see where the game goes from here, and I have no doubt that with continued support and development, Palia will become a staple in the cozy gaming genre.",

It is a little buggy sometimes (icon png files becoming neon and filled, floors disappearing, villagers and players glitching through the map) but it does not effect functionality and often disappears on its own. My wife and I got it to play together, and it is amazing, especially as neither of us are really into the combat based games like this, so this is just delightful. We are addicted and plan to play every day! The art style and character designs are immaculate, everyone feels fully rounded as a character and personality and just as every good game has, khajit has wares if you have coin! Really solid game, cannot wait to see it go up from here!",

You get stuck in conversation with the characters and have to restart your game. You will have glitches with joining parties with friends where you have to restart the game to be able to see each other's green dot on the map or that you are in a party together. Your equipment will fail to work sometimes and you will have to jump and pull out your glider to get it to work again. If that doesn't work, you will have to restart the game.\r\n\r\nGood Luck!",

          "review": "I do recommend this game. Sometimes when small companies make a game and it hits big, they tend not to hear the voice of their fans. They now have money and why should they? But so far this company and game has still kept in touch with its fan base. That hits HUGE with me. It makes such a difference for investing in the game. If you dont matter to the game then its easy to move on, though sad game companies chose that path. \r\n\r\nI am someone who likes tasks and achievments and things to do. I also value and need a good community. If the chat is toxic Im out and un-installing fast. Life is to crazy atm to spend time in a game that brings you anything but joy. So for this game you can go achievments and hunting and plushies. Or you can spend time building your home and playing hot pot games, or even better you can do all that. Their are no time limits as we palians say its easier to be kind then not. Their are also tons of videos you can watch before choosing this game to make sure its right for you. I am mostly a solo player but their are tons of palians who will group up with you quickly. We received this growable furniture that was from shared party xp. I groaned, \"oh no i have to find a group\"...but it went wonderful actually. We all grouped up and made sure people had parties so they could get their furniture too. It was a nice way of doing things here and there. so watch some videos and then decide. But for me, I recommend it and it is nice and casual and relaxing.",

The decoration system alone is absolutely amazing. The community is wonderful, everyone is always willing to help, and the way the game is designed truly fosters that. I love being able to hunt, mine, chop, forage, cook, and garden to my hearts content, and enlist the help of my friends along the way. Building friendships with the NPC's, the quests, the gifts, they are a tried and true system. I love the freedom this game gives me. Not even to mention how absolutely beautiful the game is. Its so well designed I don't even know where to start. From the cozy village to the countryside homes, to the breathtaking landscapes of the wilds. I haven't even finished the story line but I'm loving that too. \r\n\r\nMy one and only complaint, is how expensive the furniture and housing expansions are, I can never seem to make money fast enough without absolutely grinding, which is not my favorite thing to do.\r\n\r\nAll in all though, I absolutely love this game. It has managed to do everything that big publishing companies could never manage, and all in BETA. I'm extremely impressed and very much looking forward to what this game achieves in the future. All my love to the developers, and thank you, so much.",

The quests for discovery of who you are as a human in this world of Palians play like a solo dungeon crawl full of clues and puzzles to unfold a bigger sense of the world. If you enjoy the grind of farming and gathering, you can spend an entire game play session doing just that and never get bored! Or if you'd rather interact in a more meaningful way, you can build relationships with all the Palians who each have their own unique story and personality. They also unlock quests and challenges as you continue to get to know them, which feeds into your greater knowledge of the world outside the boundaries of Kilima! This game is at the top of my cozy gaming list, and is the kind of MMO I've been waiting for for a long time!",

And those patches come around sooner than we realise (every 1 month theres usually something new). \n\nGraphics are nice and a lot of the times I use the camera mode to take ingame photos. Hunting is a lot of fun, there can be a few bugs at times regarding shots or glitchy animals, but usually its pretty smooth. Mining and bug catching are my favourite, (anyone that see's my ingame plot will know that) as its simple but also makes good Palian moneys. The players, especially the regulars, are amazing and friendly and because of that I've made many new friends because of Palia. \n\nPalia still has so much potential to grow, and with the new Elderwoods update soon to come, we all are hoping they will nail it. Until then, I'll be making my house for the 100000th time (my OCD goes a bit wild ingame, it's great) and waiting for the next patch's new things that keep me coming back!",

It's especially not friendly for solo players, so my social anxiety and fear of being dog-piled for accidentally stumbling over said player-made rules has made me drop the game entirely. The game itself is fine, it's really the community that has driven me away from the game.",

But!..\r\n\r\nYou have good graphics (for an M(?)MObasebuilder indie project), you have good NPC's, with not too deep, but well-written stories. \r\n\r\nBut mainly - the gameplay and mechanics. \r\n\r\nImagine, you play, let's say, Hogwarts Legacy. And you have gameplay about making potions. Well, \"have\" is a too big of a word. You bring ingredients to cauldron, press a button, then running around like a fool for a minute. Not ten minutes, that will allow you to do something while its bubblin'. Not instantly. A minute. Of nothing to do.\r\n\r\nAnd here you have Palia, where to cook something - you need a few different stations, in multiple quantities, and you need to PLAY at each of these. I won't say that it is helluva minigame, but it is interactive, and its fun. And its better than Hogwarts Legacy, a AAA game in Wizardring(may be misspelled) world universe.\r\n\r\nAnd you can sense that in all of game contents. Its made with passion and devs think about their players, IMO.\r\n\r\nOh, and the community. Well done, Singularity 6.\r\n\r\nA con for that would be that it is HARD to create male character that is not looking like total gay. Don't get me wrong here, I don't mind that, and I can understand from where this is going, but I want to have a choice. Yes, female char is a choice, I know.",

With that said, I cannot recommend the game, every update feels like it's another push to being a cashgrab, with them now even introducing a monthly sub style - kind of similar to how gacha games have this monthly sub where, when you log in daily, get some currency. Might be worth if you feel like wanting to buy all the cosmetics but honestly, it's so pointless. Instead of making the game more stable - everytime I play I have to restart the game atleast once because something get's bugged - they just push the premium shop more. After you've finished what is similar to bundles in stardew valley, there is not much to do besides grinding for materials to craft furniture to decorate. I do like how decorating works in this game, you can clutter up everything which is quite fun, but that's about it. Multiplayer is kind of a joke aswell, wish that you could own a plot of land with a friend for example and work on it together. So no, while I will probably continue playing on and off, wouldn't recommend to new players.",

          "review": "the game is cute, but Gold feels too punishing and feels as if it limits play style to finding the \"right way\" to earn gold, which just sucks all of the fun out of what would and could be a cozy chill experience tbh, i also feel like what you sell isn't equivalent to the time of which it takes to acquire items to sell. There are alot of what seems like pointless and purposeful inconvenience features, you'd find in many mmo's like wow for example, but without a way to buy your way into convenience which i wouldn't want either but it just seems like they are pointless, for example the most obvious one, is the 30min time limit before you can go to your map and click on the return home button, most of the game i've simply just closed it or simply waited instead of doing anything because i wanted to do a specific thing, like go into ruins which require a glider to get to, so i grind for the glider but there are several progression locks and other things preventing me from doing so, i achieve this after a while and am completely underwhelmed and was when i reached the ruins just now not interested because the fun of discovering the game was killed by the meaningless time i spent doing meaningless things. i wouldn't usually be so annoyed but i did want to enjoy this and i do like the aesthetic. however i just can't reccomend this when the time sucking features within this game ruin even wanting to entertain learning about any sort of lore or story happening, when i started the game i actually enjoyed the characters now i couldn't care less because their dialouge boxes is just another thing taking time away from doing other things. /: and i really really like my home, but im not sure if i have the motivation to return. although i most likely will.. because i still haven't finished decorating it.",

THE FVCKING. TEXTURES! Get some details!!! Add some contrast! The game is 90% walking and the visual style is that of a toddler lego set. There's absolutely no stimulation, just frustration from having to walk so much through flat, boring game. Make this game beautiful, make it a joy to just be in it, and then you'll get a perfect chill game. And maybe add a transportation or boost running speed. Right now it's a game for vegetables tho",

The artwork is beautiful, the mechanics are decent to work with, the story is really interesting. My favorite part is the social choices you can make. If you want to trade plushies in the Underground and talk to other players and make friends that way, awesome! If you want to just ignore everyone for the story, go for it. It doesn't look like there's a \"wrong\" way to play, it seems very open and I love that.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do with there was more world to discover and move around in. There's a lot already, but it just feels like there could be a little more. I mean this is the case in a few games I've played, but here especially as it's an MMO. I've tried looking just today for other MMO games to scratch that itch but Palia seems to be the only one I can find. Regardless, definitely a top tier game in my book.",

          "review": "Palia is cute, and actually cozy like it states. So if you like games like that, then i'd recommend it but please keep in mind the massive issues that hide behind the tags of being \"Cozy\". Side note, this game IS IN OPEN BETA. It is NOT full release yet like they like to lead you to believe, and have BANNED people from the Official Discord for pointing it out. Now lets get into it.\n\nPros:\n- Cozy\n- Cute environment\n- Great for mindless gaming and hanging out with friends\n- Cute Concept\n\nCons:\n- Terrible execution\n- Money hungry leads (they had 50 million to do this project and lost most of it from over-hiring and poor monetization)\n- As said above; Poor monetization\n- Premium shop gets more releases every monthly patch than ACTUAL CONTENT. 15-20USD to buy a PET and around 30-70 for the outfits, some of them having special VFX that do nothing in-game other than idle animations\n- Ported over to Nintendo Switch BEFORE it was even stable on PC\n- Leadership has said they're very much uninterested in listening to any sort of positive / constructive feedback from the community.\n- VFX issues that FLASH and HAS given people seizures. \n\nThere's more but i have a limit here. so ill leave it off with a couple of Con posts from past Singularity 6 Devs:\n\n\"The Leadership does not actually listen to people. They smile and nod while people talk, but then don't act on the things people say; they just explain why the thing they decided is what we're doing. Tragically, they probably think that they are listening, but they're not. They're hearing, but they're not listening. When people say things that they don't want to hear, they ignore it. This is both internally and externally. There is almost no insight into why new players try Palia and stop playing. They instead focus on what the most die-hard players like.\"\n\n\"The leadership of S6 truly drove Palia into the ground. It breaks my heart that a project where 200 folks poured themselves into it, got ruined by poor decision making made by a handful of people. They hired massively talented people, truly the best in the industry. Just to ignore their wisdom and experience.\"\n\nThanks for reading if you did. \n\nEdit: i have 188 hours on Steam, and probably another 500 on the standalone launcher before steam release and have spent most of that time in the Discord.",

Quests are mostly fun to do and there is all sorts of things here. Gardening, mining, tree chopping, exploring, fishing.  You can talk to NPC´s and befriend them, which opens new quests. Downside of the game: Grinding and only able to give q present per week to NPC´s so leveling up friends bar is taking a long time.\r\nOverall i would give it 8/10.",

I love playing this because I like the many different fish you can catch, the many meals you can prepare, and the furniture you can make.  Most of the star items you are able to display on your plot too. You get to create your own home on your plot of land too! \r\nThe people playing the game are very helpful and kind (this is unusual for games like this in my experience).\r\nThe graphics are great and you have the ability to change your character's appearance any time you want to. The story line is neat too.\r\nOne of the things I would like to see changed is the ability to gift star items to players requesting the item as well as the base item.\r\nI highly recommend this game.",

I passed this game up when I saw a review saying there were too many in game purchases you have to make, but that is simply inaccurate.  The only purchases you make are simply cosmetic for new clothes, virtual pets, and landscapes to build your home on.  You can play this game for free no problem if you don't mind running around in basic wally world clothes.  I also read a review that said they felt the MMO aspect of the game was tacked on, and I disagree.  This game is way more fun to play with other people and you can find plenty of Palia groups on discord that will help you do that.  The community of players is super chill and helpful, and I can't say enough good things about them.  It's really the community that makes me want to continue to keep playing.  I feel like the writing is pretty solid and some of the characters have some real depth to them.  The game is still in beta, and while there are some bugs, I haven't experienced anything that has made me have to stop playing the game; all you have to do is take a moment to hit a loading screen and switch servers and the bug will go away.  I'm excited that the makers are adding new content and a whole new map is set to be released in early 2025.  I would say you can expect to get 250 hours out of this game before you've unlocked all the major upgrades, and some people continue to play the game even after a full year.  If you want this game to have longevity, you'll really have to enjoy the decorating / home building aspect as well as collecting the in game plushies.  Good games make me want to start playing as soon as I wake up in the morning, but this game exceeded that and made me want to stay up all night.",

This game is the epitome of adorable with its vibrant landscapes and charming characters that make you want to befriend every single one of them.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment you start you are welcomed into a world where you can craft your own little slice of paradise. Whether you're planting flowers catching bugs or just chilling by the riverside with your new pals everything in Palia is done with such a gentle soothing vibe.\r\n\r\nThe character customization is a bit lacky because of the paywall of outfits but if you can you should support and buy one outfit. I mean who wouldnt want to dress up their avatar in the cutest outfit while theyre out gathering resources or cooking up a storm? And speaking of cooking its not just about making food but also its about sharing moments with your in-game buddies just like a real-life potluck but with magical ingredients!\r\n\r\nOne of the best and sweetest parts of Palia is its community. The game encourages teamwork without any pressure making it the perfect place for those who love cooperative play but arent into the competitive scene. You can work together to build explore or unravel the mysteries that hide beneath the surface of this enchanting world.\r\n\r\nThe visuals are just heart-meltingly beautiful. With its soft pastel palette and whimsical designs every corner of Palia looks like its been painted with love. The music adds to this cozy ambiance making every little activity feel like a warm hug.\r\n\r\nAnd lets talk about that storyline - full of mysteries and lore that gently unfolds as you play. Its like being part of a bedtime story that you never want to end!\r\n\r\nIn essence Palia isnt just a game but its a getaway to a place where every day is a new opportunity to find joy in the simplest of activities. If you are looking for a game to unwind with to make friends and to indulge in some delightful escapism Palia is your new cozy home. Totally recommend diving into Palia for a heartwarming adventure, chill and cozy gameplay and sweetest community!",

The ingame dialogue is interesting and even scandalous at times.  There are a few Palia trackers avail to help you keep track of daily, weekly, and quest tasks. You can play together with upto 3 of your friends and everyone in the party gets drops while working together to hunt, farm etc... even cooking.  Flow trees need more than one person to chop down, so working together as a community to clear groves becomes a fun part of the game.  You can also hunt magical Sernuk,  Muujin, and Choppa together and everyone get the loot.  You will spend hours on this game, so grab a drink and snack.  Enjoy the beautiful graphics and fun game play.  \r\n\r\nYou will need at least 16GB RAM to run this game smoothly and a high speed Internet connection for the best results.",

Im sorry its a bit ridiculous. Id love to play this game more because you can decorate your home and expand and can romance villagers, but the running around for 30 minutes trying to navigate this huge map is too much of a chore without any spawns/waystones, So I really tried but i wont be playing until theres waystones implemented of some kind, and that timer on your home teleport is AT LEAST lessened because 20 min is way too much. \nalso it says its multiplayer, but theres literally nothing to do with other players, they just run around the map, idk if the team will add some kind of multiplay or co-farm but if they removed multiplayer thered be absolutely NO difference or change, kinda dissapointing since i wanted to play with my friend.\n\nOther than all of that, this game has a lot of potential and i def recommend for a free game, but i warn you you will be running around more than half the time.",

The glitches are tolerable, if annoying, but it's the intense focus on overpriced, paid content that I can't get behind. The main story line is also lacking, and there's not enough content in general for me to really appreciate the game. I'll continue to push my grievances to the side until the next update, but I'm not holding out hope tbh.",

          "review": "This game is amazing! I have sunk quite a few hours into it now and I am still uncovering new quests and mechanics I didn't know about. Here are my favourite things about Palia.\n\n- The amount of decoration options you have for your home plot is amazing. It's also incredibly easy. You grow trees and flowers for the plot and create beautiful pieces of furniture.\n- The grind for items is real. You will spend ages fishing, chopping trees and mining rocks but for me it didn't feel that bad. Maybe it is different for others but I had fun!\n- The store is surprisingly cheap, not more than the average big Fortnite skin, and for a free game it makes sense too. The outfits and gliders are cute.\n- The story and NPC's are amazing! It's so interesting to be the human in this new world after the age of humans. I can't wait to see where the story goes from here. The villagers as well are adorable and all have their own personalities. I am partial to Jina and Hodari.\n- The map is gorgeous! The art style and designs of locations and buildings are amazing. I can't count the number of times I just stood in a flared grove watching the pink dust fly into the sky.\n- Mechanics are so amazing here. The flared trees and fishing is so fun. I love fishing for once. I own enjoy fishing in this game and Far Cry 5!\n- Progression is wonderful. You unlock dialogue with certain NPC's and join associated clubs when you reach level 10, gaining new tools, recipes and other fun items to help you along.\n- With the tools given to us, the community is so wonderful! Everyone is so nice and the gifting system makes it good fun to help others.\n\nFew cons\n- Customisation options are lacking a little bit but I'm not too fussed.\n- The RNG from fishing and bugs is a bit too hard for me. After fishing for 4 real life days I still don't have the fish I want.\n\nBar that it's perfect! The game is wonderful and I can't wait for it continue. The devs are doing a great job and I urge you to play it and if you enjoy it drop a few coins on the cute outfits and pets you can buy through the premium shop!",

          "review": "Before I get into my review, I want to note that while my Steam profile shows just over 60 hours in Palia, I’ve played the game far more through the client. I participated in its alpha phase and spent additional time playing directly through the client before it became available on Steam.\n\nI was initially drawn to Palia because it was pitched as the ultimate cozy farming/life sim game... combining all the elements I love in an MMO setting. It felt like a dream game in theory. However, that initial promise has shifted dramatically.... the game no longer even markets itself as an MMO (It did in development phase. There's 25 ppl per instance). \n\nWhile updates have been announced periodically, they often feel like a letdown for me. It seems the focus is mostly on paid premium content like outfits, pets, and tool skins. While those cosmetic options are nice, what the game really needs is GOOD engaging content.\n\nThe housing and decorating system is the highlight of Palia for me. Compared to other cozy games, it stands out for its creativity and flexibility, allowing for freeform building if you have imaginative ideas. Unfortunately, the rest of the content feels too repetitive and boring. Hunting, for example, involves just two animals. Earning money can be frustratingly slow, especially for players who don’t have a lot of time to invest into the game.\n\nHere are some suggestions for improvement:\n\n-Introduce ranching and the ability to gather ingredients like eggs, milk, and butter yourself instead of relying solely on the shop\n-More open world animals (even if not solely for hunting)\n-Add events and cute cutscenes with romance partners to make relationships more interesting\n-Create more open world activities and events that would encourage players to gather for fun, meaningful rewards\n\nThere’s more that could be done, but this is already getting too long. If you enjoy the game as it is, that’s great! However, for me, Palia feels like it has a lot of untapped potential. While I’ll hop on occasionally, it doesn’t hook me the way other farming and life sim games do.\n\nI don't recommend for the long term, but you can try it out for yourself.",

          "review": "The general atmosphere of Palia is quite inoffensive, with clean visuals and gameplay. However, the experience is locked behind real time paywalls from grinding for resources and spending hours running around the world to waiting hours and days of actual time for things to happen in game. They claim to promote a social environment, and then have the servers be multilingual. You cannot socialize effectively with players who do not speak the same language. The NPC's are not interesting to talk to. I don't think this is a bad game per se, and since most of the issues are game design related all of them could be fixed easily, but as it stands I cannot recommend sinking time and energy into this.",

There are many many bugs. From simple texture issues and Non functioning game mechanics to complete game crashes and log in failures.\n\nWhile the updates come with minor bugs fixes they don't address a large number and introduce way more than they fix.\n\nThis game is in Beta but it's late into Beta and has become completely unplayable for many. If it makes it to full release I may try again and adjust my review. However based on the companies priorities I doubt it will get a full release.",

And you can only group with someone if they are right in front of you.\r\n\r\nThe events are 100% CRAP. You only have limited time to get the rewards. In chappa chase you have to get 25 in one event. I have yet to see anyone get it. There are only a total of about 100 to get in the time limit with 10-20 people chasing them. There is a card game where you compete against 3 other people, yet you need to get 10 wins. The event runs for 1 week and there are only 12 times a day the event is active. Then you will have to wait for ANOTHER YEAR to try to get them again. Except for the limited time ones, which you will never be able to get\r\n\r\nYou have to group for things like chopping flow trees, yet you have to compete i AGAINST people to get the few no $$$$ real money items. Pure 100% crap",

          "review": "I had high hopes for Pallia—the game concept is fantastic, and the community aspect is one of its strongest points. However, my experience has been deeply disappointing due to the game's lack of progress on crucial issues.\n\nThe game has been plagued with bugs and glitches for a long time, many of which are well-known among players. Despite repeated feedback from the community, it seems like no serious effort has been made to address these issues or improve the gameplay experience.\n\nInstead, the focus appears to have shifted almost entirely to releasing new cosmetic outfits for real-money purchases. While I understand the need for monetization, it feels frustrating to see so much attention placed on paid content while long-standing problems remain unaddressed.\n\nIt’s disheartening to see a game with so much potential stall in its development. Unless the developers prioritize fixing these issues and showing they genuinely care about the community’s feedback, it’s hard to recommend this game to others.",

If you play the game, this will make sense.",

The seniors/leads are very kind and patient in explaining technicalities and they make sure you understand the reason for things to work the way they do. \n\nIf you want to learn and grow in your discipline, S6 is the place to do it. Not to mention you'll get to work on some amazing content!\n\nThe best part of it all, in my opinion, is the team dynamics. Being a skilled professional is important, but couple that with a great personality and you have the perfect colleagues. I did not meet a single employee at S6 that did not fit this bill.",

Some folks became ill from overwork.\n\nLeadership had and still has very little diversity, which is painfully noticeable in the type of decisions taken.\n\nTeam structuring creates massive silo-ing and strong \"our team vs. yours\" in terms of output. Very little collaboration is possible, slowing the whole project down. Never worked at a place so inefficient.",

This applies to frontline managers all the way up to top leadership. This is despite parading a feedback culture. ICs who provide feedback have the feedback turned around and weaponized against them in performance reviews or elsewhere. The company is packed full of very talented ICs who are deprived of the support they need to succeed, and then blamed and take punishment when things don't go the way leadership wants them to. \r\n\r\n\r\n- Dishonesty and deceit is rampant in communication to employees. Never have I seen such a level of dishonest behavior from leadership, especially at such a small company. I can understand a need to be careful on what information to be transparent with, but the leadership very frequently, intentionally, and blatantly lies to everyone at the company about the state of the company. The sad part is that these lies are very shallow and most people see through them, but they serve their short-sighted purpose of keeping the illusion of the \"everything is fine\" dog. One example is telling everyone there will only be a few weeks of \"targeted overtime, not crunch\", knowing full well that it would last indefinitely for many.\r\n\r\n - Diversity problems explicitly ignored by leadership because it's not a \"priority,\" despite the large human impact of them. The company made big promises around D&amp;I to employees, and has failed to live up to them. And recently things have gotten much worse. \r\n\r\nThere are many other problems I did not list here. I fear that many more good people at the company will be hurt by the reckless course management is taking the company.",

Then had a personal disagreement with engineering leadership on topics they know are problematic in the company during a 1:1 and, the very next week, they fired me.\r\nThey also originally hid that it was a firing when they shared with the rest of the company until enough people reached out to me and learned otherwise. Then they edited the Slack message announcing my departure.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, I am not saying leadership failed by firing me. Sometimes firings are the best move (though, I do not personally think that is true in my case, you don't know). I am noting that why it happened, how it happened, and what things occurred and did not occur are all serious concerns for the company going forward.

We are upfront about role expectations and very often make accommodations for folks that feel compelled to contribute in new spaces and/or grow as individuals.\n\nOur HR team has worked incredibly hard to generate candidates for roles that include a very diverse set of potential candidates and we make a specific effort to reach out and be inclusive to the various minorities that are specifically under represented in the industry.\n\nThe product is well thought out and everyone involved is invested in making it excellent.

As we scale, know that this will require delegating that responsibility downward, relying on sub-teams to foster their own unique sub-cultures as inspired derivatives of the original Singularity6's culture. \nIn service of diversifying our team, I think we're finally making some steps in the right direction there - ensuring we're actively seeking a diverse candidate pool and now hiring for mid-level roles where previously we were only looking for senior candidates, but we've built quite an uphill battle for ourselves given the team we have now. We can do better here. I truly believe we could be a shining example of how diverse perspectives bring about the most amazing games.",

While S6 has done a remarkable job, particularly during a pandemic, at staying connected, we struggle with projects that require multiple-team coordination. This challenge is also well known and discussed, making it possible to try to improve things rather than just accepting it as it is. While I enjoy the challenge of helping shape how an organization collaborates, if you're looking for well-defined and stable team responsibilities, S6 may not be right for you. \n* While we talk openly about the challenges of creating a diverse workforce in engineering game dev, we are having a difficult time making progress in this direction. While I believe, given our values and culture of respect, people from underrepresented groups would flourish here, we haven't demonstrated the ability to hire diverse candidates yet. Part of this can be attributed to a very senior staff, which skews both our network and our candidate pool, but we need to do better in this space than we are now. \n* While work-life balance is good, it does require self-discipline to balance your time. This project is really exciting and we have a lot of passionate and engaged people. This enthusiasm is contagious and if you're not experienced at holding yourself accountable to other commitments it can absorb a lot of time. The upside is everyone is aware of this and is thoroughly supportive (like I mentioned above) of your away from work. We're in this for the long run.",

This extends from what it's like to build a game as a developer into what it's like to be a player of our game. \n* We think long term, doing what's important over urgent far more often than even large companies with stable budgets do. Our financial investors in the company make this possible too, keeping our focus on the long-term over short term gains. \n* The work-life balance is good, any extra time I dedicate to work comes from my own passion for the project. I'm actively encouraged by my leaders and peers to take time for family and myself. Taking an afternoon off because you've had a hard week is normalized. We have open PTO as well, which our leaders demonstrate taking time away from work is critical to our long-term success. \n* The game we're building is simply delightful, bringing a much needed warmth and coziness to the industry at a quality bar that makes me intensely proud to support building it.\n* We're building a live service game. We're here to build a relationship with our players that could last a lifetime.

The end result is an organization that is extremely rules-oriented instead of outcomes-oriented, using non-working rules and processes. The flow of work at S6 goes like this: if there's a process, we follow it, if there's not a process, we create one (either someone tries to replicate a process that existed at a company at least 10x the size, or someone copy-pastes \"best practice\" from a blog post, HBR article, or ChatGPT) and then follow that process forever, regardless of whether the process that was created is working or not. In engineering, decisions are made that seem to stem more from how they will look on people's resume's than how they will impact the company's chances of success.\n\nIt is extremely difficult to get things done at this company.

While I enjoy the challenge of helping shape how an organization collaborates, if you're looking for well-defined and stable team responsibilities, S6 may not be right for you. \n* While we talk openly about the challenges of creating a diverse workforce in engineering game dev, we are having a difficult time making progress in this direction. While I believe, given our values and culture of respect, people from underrepresented groups would flourish here, we haven't demonstrated the ability to hire diverse candidates yet. Part of this can be attributed to a very senior staff, which skews both our network and our candidate pool, but we need to do better in this space than we are now. \n* While work-life balance is good, it does require self-discipline to balance your time. This project is really exciting and we have a lot of passionate and engaged people. This enthusiasm is contagious and if you're not experienced at holding yourself accountable to other commitments it can absorb a lot of time.

This extends from what it's like to build a game as a developer into what it's like to be a player of our game. \n* We think long term, doing what's important over urgent far more often than even large companies with stable budgets do. Our financial investors in the company make this possible too, keeping our focus on the long-term over short term gains. \n* The work-life balance is good, any extra time I dedicate to work comes from my own passion for the project. I'm actively encouraged by my leaders and peers to take time for family and myself. Taking an afternoon off because you've had a hard week is normalized. We have open PTO as well, which our leaders demonstrate taking time away from work is critical to our long-term success. \n* The game we're building is simply delightful, bringing a much needed warmth and coziness to the industry at a quality bar that makes me intensely proud to support building it.\n* We're building a live service game. We're here to build a relationship with our players that could last a lifetime.

Never have I seen such a level of dishonest behavior from leadership, especially at such a small company. I can understand a need to be careful on what information to be transparent with, but the leadership very frequently, intentionally, and blatantly lies to everyone at the company about the state of the company. The sad part is that these lies are very shallow and most people see through them, but they serve their short-sighted purpose of keeping the illusion of the \"everything is fine\" dog. One example is telling everyone there will only be a few weeks of \"targeted overtime, not crunch\", knowing full well that it would last indefinitely for many.\r\n\r\n - Diversity problems explicitly ignored by leadership because it's not a \"priority,\" despite the large human impact of them. The company made big promises around D&amp;I to employees, and has failed to live up to them. And recently things have gotten much worse. \r\n\r\nThere are many other problems I did not list here.

      "# [The Software Architecture of Palia](https://www.singularity6.com/news/software-architecture-of-palia)\nSingularity6’s debut game, Palia, is a free-to-play cozy online multiplayer community simulator. A place where players can play alone or with their friends to experience a beautiful and welcoming world which can be explored and personalized.\n\nSocial interaction and a persistent shared world are key features of the game. But these elements are also some of the most challenging to implement, scale, distribute geographically, and operate at minimal operational cost and negative player impact.\n\nPlayers experience the art and soul that our development team has poured into the game, but the infrastructure that makes it all possible behind the scenes is hidden from view. We are proud of what our team has accomplished with Palia, and we want to spotlight the studio’s hard work, including what players don’t experience directly. We also want to share some important lessons learned during our journey; we hope that sharing the lessons learned while developing Palia can be useful to others facing similar challenges.\n\nNow follow us behind the scenes of our Palia development journey!\n\nGame Engine\n\nBuilding an online multiplayer title from scratch benefits from a robust and proven game engine. We made the choice to build Palia using Unreal Engine. Unreal gives us powerful tools to build with out of the box, such as a strong networking and replication library to build social features, a graphics pipeline to build a beautiful world, a powerful physics engine that can simulate complex environments, and so much more. We use Unreal Engine for our game servers as well as our client, which gives players a real-time interactive environment.\n\nEach instance of the game server currently hosts up to 25 players, and we split up each server by what we call a map. These can be permanent fixtures, including our central hub Kilima Village, or even temporary available experiences, such as our Maji Market, which was only available for one month during our Luna New Year in-game event. When players travel between maps in Palia, the game client disconnects from one server and connects to a new one. We will share more details on how this works in our matchmaking service deep dive section.\n\nThis synergistic model is crucial for our team: we can develop most of the logic for Palia inside the engine and deploy to both clients and servers. This allows anyone on the team to test both the game and the game server in editor mode, which has been critical for our development velocity.\n\nSpotlight: memory leakage\n\nUnreal Engine servers are commonly used in “session-based games,” such as Fortnite: games that start and end within a certain amount of time. Memory leakage is not a big concern for session-based games because a new server is spun up for a new match and destroyed when the match ends. Any leaked memory will be cleaned before the next batch of players begin playing.\n\nPalia is a persistent shared-world game and the lifespan of our game servers is variable depending on how players move through the game world. A single game server may remain online and serve players for an entire patch cycle which could be weeks. Memory leakage which is cleaned up regularly for a session-based game can grow and compound, and small leaks might end up consuming two or even four times the amount of Random Access Memory (RAM) proportionally affecting our operational costs.\n\nTo combat this issue, we invested in solutions to help us identify memory leaks, and we spent useful time designing nudges for players to travel between maps as to increase the likelihood that a server would empty out and be shut down.\n\nUnexpectedly and fortunately, increasing geographical distribution helped with this problem: hosting servers near players not only helps with latency (because it reduces the distance that signals need to travel); but also with rotating empty servers because players tend to play at the same times, making it rare that somebody in that region is playing in the middle of the night and increasing the probability of servers to become empty, shut down, and cleaned.\n\nThis screenshot from one of our monitoring dashboards shows the memory usage of a portion of our game servers over a24h period in Feb 2024. The trend of linear memory increase is clearly visible.\n\nServices\n\nThe game client and servers talk to our services for specific actions, such as logging players into the game, loading characters, saving progress, sending chat messages to other players, making purchased outfits are stored in the player’s closet and many more.\n\nWe loosely follow a “microservice” posture, in which we prefer to host many different services specialized on one player feature.\n\nWe use HTTP as the North/South protocol (in and out of the datacenter) while we use gRPC for East/West communication (for services talking to each other inside the datacenter).\n\nWe use Rust exclusively as the programming language for our services and we try to include both integration and load testing as part of the definition of “done” for key services, including matchmaking, player presence and player state persistence which represent the largest percentage of our request load.\n\nOur unit and integration tests are also written in Rust, but we use Locust to support and execute our load tests. Locust load tests are written in Python which is simpler to program. The ability to quickly write and modify load tests was beneficial to us and sped up adoption.\n\nSpotlight: Rust for Microservices\n\nRust is a beloved programming language by many systems programmers because it provides state-of-the-art protection against common software vulnerabilities (buffer overflows and race conditions, for example) without introducing any performance penalties.\n\nRust is also a modern programming language. It is surrounded by a diverse and vibrant community of contributors and a wide range of libraries and tools. Documentation is excellent (especially onboarding tutorials) and the compiler is surely one of the most helpful and user-friendly.\n\nOf course, no programming language is perfect. Rust's posture is heavily focused on correctness, which is generally beneficial, but comes with a significant upfront cost which is visible in our development velocity. Rust makes it very hard to “cut corners” and punt hardening for later. It is a very good quality when something that was supposed to be just a prototype becomes load bearing in production by sheer pressure of business needs, but it makes it hard to move quickly and with agility around shifting requirements (which is a constant in startups and game development).\n\nThe other issue was hiring and onboarding. Rust’s relative youth as a programming language makes it somewhat difficult to hire people that have production experience with the language. Although the language is very popular, few people have used Rust in a professional team setting. Most people who have Rust experience have only used it for personal projects. With this in mind, onboarding took much longer than we expected. We factored 90 days to get engineers up to speed, but it turned out to take at least 6 months for most of the team to get comfortable and confident with the language.\n\nWe are very happy with the performance, latency, scalability, robustness and security of our Rust services. But there are moments when we wonder how much opportunity cost was spent in forcing up-front solidity of every piece of this layer.\n\nWe consider it an advantage for the studio to have managed to amortize those onboarding costs and the maintenance costs of our services is indeed very low, but those thinking of following our footsteps down the Rust path, should be willing to allocate a significant effort to education and onboarding. These costs will likely reduce over time as Rust becomes more popular in production settings, but it’s unclear what that rate will be.\n\nSeveral of our services are interesting and sophisticated enough to merit more attention: player state management and matchmaking.\n\nPlayer State Management\n\nWe consider player state all the information that a game server needs to recreate the most recent game world experienced by the player. The architecture of our game is server-authoritative which means that game servers decide the state of the world and act as referees when game clients report inconsistent data (for example, because of time delay in transmission). We took this route because Palia is a social game so a player cheating or modifying their state could have a negative impact on the experience of other players. The risk of cheating is reduced when it's our system that ultimately controls player state.\n\nThe simplest way to persist state is to wait until a player exits a game server and have the server send this information to the database. Unfortunately, this makes state changes in that server vulnerable to the server itself crashing and losing that data (which is only kept in volatile memory for performance reasons). Instead, several times a second we check for player state changes, and if there are any, that data is immediately queued and sent to the database to be persisted.\n\nSpotlight: data first vs. schema first\n\nA source of contention around player state is the modeling lifecycle: who and what decides what is valid to be stored into such a state? Traditional data-modeling techniques suggest a “schema first” approach: the structure of the data (the schema) is created ahead of time and then only data that conforms to that structure can be saved into the database.\n\nThis has the advantage that the database validates the shape of the data. The disadvantage is that one has to know ahead of time the structure of the data needed… which can be challenging to coordinate across different teams.\n\nTo increase the ease with which game engineers and technical designers could work, we decided on a different model in which the structure of the data would be decided in C++ structs directly within Unreal and then marshaled and persisted in the database as a binary blob (using the Flexbuffer format). The schema is the struct declaration itself and we use Unreal’s runtime type reflection system to export the schema to our database.\n\nThe advantage of this architectural choice is that it enabled game engineers to develop features that required state persistence without the need for constant coordination. The downside is that the data is opaque to the database, which is more expensive to keep uniform and consolidated. This has required us to invest in additional tooling around the player state management system to validate, backup, modify and correct player state when it diverges from the expected structure.\n\nDespite the additional layer of development investment needed to provide hardening on top of what the database normally provides, we believe this architecture has significantly cut down the time required to deliver new features with data persistence, such as our most recent Luna New Year event.\n\nMatchmaking\n\nIn many competitive-style online games, matchmaking is the process of selecting people for a match. For Palia, matchmaking means matching the player with the game server that we believe will give players the best gameplay experience.\n\nThere are several dimensions that we take into consideration during matching:\n\nLocation - how far away the game server is from where the player is currently playing (because closer server means lower latency and lower latency means a more fluid and immersive experience)\n\nFriends - how many of the player’s friends are currently playing on that server (because the more people they know the more meaningful their interaction will be)\n\nPopulation - how many people are playing on that server (because the more people are playing the more alive the world feels)\n\nThe matchmaking system is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing us to add more signals to the matching algorithm over time if we desire.\n\nAnother crucial feature of the matchmaking system is the ability to distinguish “join” requests and “travel” requests. A join request happens when a player starts the game and wants to join. A travel request is a match required by a player leaving one map of the game and traveling to another.\n\nThe ability to distinguish the two allows us to offer priority to “travel” requests when the system is under load and there is high contention. This is because it’s far less disruptive for players to wait a few minutes to join and then wait only a few seconds to travel between maps, than one in which the delays are spread uniformly across all matching requests.\n\nThis screenshot shows a piece of the dashboard we use to monitor queue sizes and the distribution of times it takes for a matchmaking request (join or travel) to be satisfied.\n\nSpotlight: game-aware internal queueing and autoscaling\n\nEvery empty server running in the cloud without a player on it is a waste of money. On the other hand, there might be players who want to play and all of the game servers have their allocated slots filled so they would benefit from an empty server to land in.\n\nMany online games design “login queues” or similar ways to restrict the inbound flow of players and scale up or down the number of servers to meet the demand. Originally, this was our intent as well, but we realized we would benefit from a more sophisticated matchmaking design that could distinguish between joining and traveling. We also realized that the matchmaker had all the information it needed to control the size of the game server fleet.\n\nThis is how we came up with the Admiral: a component of the matchmaking system that oversees the fleet of game servers. The Admiral understands when the current fleet of game servers is insufficient to satisfy the number of players requesting a match and is able to ask the underlying cloud system (specifically Agones) to request the creation of more game server instances. Agones, on the other hand, is responsible for shutting down game servers that have been empty for some time.\n\nThe integration of autoscaling with matchmaking and the separation of concerns between the Admiral (scaling up) and Agones (scaling down) has served us very well and has managed to provide us with shock absorption to the game when things didn’t go as planned. Several times, the elasticity of these queues between maps have saved the team from having to bring down the game entirely to fix issues during misaligned deployments or unforeseen behaviors during load spikes.\n\nThis screenshot shows the view of the game servers fleet from the Admiral. Each line is really two lines: one for the “desired size” and another for the “actual size”. This information is used to tell the cloud orchestrator to spin up more game servers for a particular map type as they are needed by players being matched to servers that don’t yet exist.\n\nData Management\n\nOur architecture of loosely coupled software components wouldn’t be very useful without data flowing between them and being persisted, validated, or aggregated.\n\nDatabases\n\nOne of the most difficult elements of creating a shared perpetual world is constructing the ability for players to influence it (and one another) in a context that feels immediate and consistent. A key factor to provide a positive player experience is the choice of the database architecture.\n\nWe decided to use ScyllaDB as our main data persistence layer. ScyllaDB is a C++ rewrite of Apache Cassandra (originally created at Facebook and, in turn, heavily influenced by Google BigTable and Amazon DynamoDB), a distributed column store.\n\nThe biggest advantage of ScyllaDB for us has been its elastic scalability and its cloud native “design for failure” posture that aligned very well with ours. One significant advantage of ScyllaDB for us is the ability to attach replication strategy to a table but eventual consistency levels to a query. This gives us a lot of flexibility because in some cases we need consistency more than we need speed and we can tune that directly at the query level. This is not possible with traditional relational databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL.\n\nThis functionality is crucial, for example, when dealing with a persistent player state: we want the data to be replicated on multiple computers before we return a response to the game server. This means that both the game server and multiple database nodes have to die (at the very same time!) for that player state update to get lost. As far as we can tell, this has never happened.\n\nWe also use PostgreSQL (hosted for us by AWS) for the catalog of our outfits available for purchase in the game. We used a relational database here because we felt it was better suited for this particular job.\n\nAsynchronous Messaging\n\nAnother important part of the data management layer is the ability of software components to message one another asynchronously.\n\nWe have two of such busses:\n\nThe first for aggregates and collects telemetry for player behavior (which uses Apache Kafka, more on this later) and feeds our analytics and machine learning pipelines.\n\nAnother coordinates software components (for example, the control plane between the fleet auto-scaler and the game servers). This uses EMQX as the broker and MQTT as the protocol.\n\nWhy two? Mostly because they serve different purposes, have different strengths and weaknesses, and are managed by different teams focusing on separate outcomes. There might be value in consolidating things further in the future, but for now this separation is serving us well.\n\nSpotlight: MQTT and Apache ActiveMQ v5 (aka Artemis)\n\nThe use of MQTT as the message bus protocol for our game servers control planes was decided precisely to isolate us from lock-in of a particular broker implementation. In retrospect, this was a weak choice: MQTT is an IoT protocol and we were attracted by the fact that it was designed for devices with small power and low bandwidth. We wanted a solution that would be easy and cheap for the game servers to interact with and didn’t consume a lot of their resources.\n\nUnfortunately, many MQTT brokers simply implemented that protocol on top of their existing native systems. We picked Apache ActiveMQ v5 (aka Artemis) because it was established and it supported v5 of the MQTT protocol (which offered features we needed) but was written and designed before clouds existed and turned out to be incompatible with our preferred “loosely coupled components expected to fail” architectural posture.\n\nArtemis has been the source of much apprehension and tribulation. We ended up having to patch the software to fit our needs. We operated with a forked version in production just to keep it from falling over regularly (the MQTT layer and cross-regional federation layers did not work well together).\n\nWe have since migrated to EMQX which is a more modern MQTT broker, designed from the ground-up with MQTT in mind and we have not looked back.\n\nThe lesson learned here is that even established and battle-tested software might still end up performing poorly when utilized in a different context and with different operational constraints than was originally intended.\n\nData Pipelines\n\nAnother important principle of our software architecture is that we want to be able to observe and monitor how the system is behaving so that we can act on it effectively when behavior deviates from the norm.\n\nWe treat data differently based on whether the decision making that it supports is latency sensitive or not. In fact, we use completely different systems for low-latency decision support (seconds to minutes) vs. high-latency (days or weeks).\n\nSpotlight: player behavior vs. system behavior\n\nIn the past, we separated data based on whether it was about player behavior or software behavior. But we quickly realized that distinction was not very helpful in practice.\n\nFor example, a purchasing event from a player is technically a player behavior and insights gathered from them influence strategic decision making with high-latency (days or weeks). But such a high-latency reaction would be detrimental to both our players and our revenue if we didn’t get notified immediately if the frequency of purchases dropped outside of the normal range of operation.\n\nIt is generally true that data generated from the behavior of players influences decision making in aggregate and with high latency while events generated by the behavior of software systems influences decisions and actions that require quick reaction times. But our ability to route data based on decision making latency needs and not on the semantics of origin has made it easier to reason about data routing decisions, especially when the two pipelines are handled by different teams with different skills, strengths, and goals.\n\nObservability\n\nWe picked Prometheus as the time-series database powering the low-latency data pipeline and alerting. The key advantage here is the “pull” model in which it is Prometheus to “scrape” data from our software components, which makes it a lot simpler to maintain.\n\nWe also use Grafana as our visual dashboarding system querying the data stored in Prometheus along with Loki and Tempo to deal textual logs and tracing the flow of execution across several of our software components.\n\nLastly, we use Sloth to automate the generation of SLOs.\n\nAnalytics\n\nThe high-latency data pipeline revolves around Apache Kafka (managed for us by Confluent) which captures and routes the data as well as Apache Spark (managed for us by Databricks), which we use to aggregate and analyze the data.\n\nWe use Apache Airflow (managed for us by Astronomer) for monitoring and scheduling long-running workflows for data aggregation and analysis. Lastly, we use Tableau to power the visualization of the insights that result from our data analysis.\n\nCloud Infrastructure\n\nAnother development challenge is the “free-to-play” nature of our distribution strategy. This approach made it difficult to predict the amount of players that would play the game, especially around key events, such as platform launches, major updates, and in-game events.\n\nWe decided to be “cloud native” from the start because “elasticity” in supply of computation and bandwidth is a key advantage that cloud providers have over acquiring and maintaining our own server infrastructure; especially for gaming startups (for which capital is constrained) and when deploying across multiple geographical regions.\n\nCloud native for us didn’t simply mean: “run our programs on somebody else’s computer.” Cloud native for us meant designing a software architecture composed of small pieces that are loosely coupled and always expected to fail.\n\nWe call this “designing for failure.” Of course, we never want our systems to fail. However, we believe that resiliency in software systems comes less from preventing failure, and more from providing mitigations to such risks and the ability to restore service as quickly and automatically as possible. We want to design to reduce failure but we always expect it to happen, so when it does happen, our systems would not be surprised by it.\n\nKey components of this strategy were using Kubernetes as our orchestration system, Linkerd as our service mesh, Traefik as our load balancer and Agones to manage our fleet of game servers. We also rely heavily on the “infrastructure as code” principle, using Kustomize to help us keep our configurations DRY and ArgoCD to power continuous deployments.\n\nKubecost helps us measure costs, and we recently swapped from cluster-autoscaler to Karpenter to optimize cluster elasticity and to help pick the best server instances. This change allowed us to save a non-trivial percentage of our cloud costs by automating the selection of instance types to use to run our workloads.\n\nFor provisioning infrastructure we rely on Terraform and Spacelift. We rely on Vault to store secrets without our cloud environments. We also conduct chaos testing using Litmus.\n\nAnd we rely on a few different services for authentication and authorization systems, including FusionAuth for account management, Zendesk for customer support management, Stripe for payment processing, and Vivox for our in-game chat system.\n\nOur only cloud provider is Amazon Web Services which provides us computers, storage, and bandwidth across multiple regions: United States, Germany, and Japan. We also rely on Cloudflare for geo-aware DNS and load balancing as well as DDoS protection.\n\nSpotlight: Nomad vs. Kubernetes\n\nWe had originally chosen Nomad as our orchestration solution, mostly because it was perceived to be conceptually simpler and it was much more compatible with Windows workloads (which we thought we might need for testing purposes).\n\nUnfortunately, Nomad had one very significant problem: the momentum of the development community around it was significantly smaller than around Kubernetes. This had two significant issues for us: a) we had to develop in-house solutions that the community around Kubernetes had already implemented; and b) it was harder to engage the team with a technology that many considered an evolutionary dead-end.\n\nWe made the difficult call to switch our cloud orchestration system by using the argument that our development velocity would significantly improve and our operational risks would be reduced. This turned out to be very much the case and it’s a decision we would happily make again.\n\nBuild Systems\n\nThere are two primary concepts used in the building of Palia and its supporting services: the build platform and the build system. Historically, game studios lumped these two together around the primary continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) component. We borrowed some plays from large-scale build and release systems beyond gaming: using a heavily distributed approach inspired by some of our team members’ experiences in other industries, such as banking.\n\nTo power the build system we use Jenkins, but take care to draw a distinction between the software, and the underlying infrastructure upon which it runs and integrates. While related, these things are best served by intentional, separate configuration management and Infrastructure as Code practices which can quickly become unwieldy and complex if attempting to do so under a monolithic design. The result is a hybrid cloud approach to the build system. We use both an on-prem data center and Amazon Web Services, and one side of the architecture can be maintained without potentially negatively impacting the other.\n\nWe also took the time to redesign the initial version of the build system (Jenkins pipelines) around Unreal Engine’s native tooling, namely, BuildGraph. Doing so required a lot of work up-front as the old method was cobbled together between Jenkins Pipelines and Python scripts, but the declarative nature of BuildGraph tooling has allowed us to increase correctness, reduce build system maintenance, and increase flexibility such that we can build almost every target platform with minimal specific changes for each. A key component of this success was integrating with AutoSDK and creating a “standard library” of sorts in Jenkins to glue it all together.\n\nIn our latest version of the build platform we are able to mostly dynamically scale the number of executors based on demand. The build system can then simply act as a “glue layer” to distribute requested tasks among the available executors as parallel pipeline runs. Further, we’ve incorporated designing for Self-Service by other teams, such that they can “pick and choose” which artifacts they want built via a single interface. We call this the “Prime Pipeline,” which presents a series of configurable parameters and then schedules the running of “Sub-Pipelines” to do the work, passing those parameters as appropriate. This means that via the same Prime Pipeline interface, one Engineer could choose to build only one Platform Client from the library of Clients available, and one Server, getting only those two artifacts; or they could select everything and end up with every Client and Server we currently offer as targets.\n\nSpotlight: Capacity Management in a Hybrid Cloud World\n\nA trade-off we make for this level of granularity and distribution is the initial difficulty in managing capacity. We use several build executors of different types and had to really break-down our pipelines and how each stage would be distributed to the executors both on-prem and in AWS. Then we had to measure a single run of each pipeline to get more accurate numbers to use for calculating instance sizes, costs, expected load, and timings for stage and whole pipeline execution. This cost us a lot of time up-front, and while we are glad we did it, it is yet another piece of operational overhead which must be monitored, reviewed, and adjusted in order to remain reasonably accurate. Changing something as simple as the Node Label of a particular pipeline Stage can have serious impacts to all of the metrics we measure, most notably, build times. Unfortunately, there aren't a whole lot of “drop-in” or “off-the-shelf” solutions for these types of systems, so we have had to track these things manually, and then automate as we go to attempt to reduce the operational burden.\n\nFurthermore, managing two different sets of infrastructure is not for the faint of heart, or those unfamiliar with Hybrid Cloud management. While the patterns may be very similar, the implementation proved to be a lot more work than we anticipated.\n\nFor example, AWS and other cloud service providers make APIs available to interact on a very granular level with their exposed components. On the other end of the spectrum, even the most mature on-prem infrastructure providers rely on their own custom tooling for managing hardware components. This is why projects such as Ansible are in such heavy use in the IT industry, and S6 is no exception here as we prioritize the use of open source tools where possible to ease cognitive load and keep costs low.\n\nThe challenge that made this most difficult was the disparity in experience using this approach on our team members’ time. Some of us come from more of a Platforming background, others from a Tooling background, and still others from primarily a Jenkins Pipeline writing background. This is great for general cross-functionality within the team, but requires careful planning to execute well even among the highest-performing teams.\n\nVersion Control\n\nWe use two different version control systems to manage the development lifecycle of our code: Perforce for the game code, and git (hosted in Bitbucket) for everything else.\n\nUsing different version control systems is clearly suboptimal and not a decision we took lightly: git is generally preferred by backend engineers and is far better supported by modern development environments.\n\nUnfortunately, Perforce is very well integrated in Unreal Engine because that’s what Epic Games uses (the makers of Unreal Engine). Also, git isn’t really designed to work with very large binary files, and a lot of our in-game assets and original sources are giant binary files. Perforce works well in these situations.\n\nEarly on, we tried using git-lfs (large file storage), which is supposed to help with this problem but we gave up when we realized how much effort it would be to retrofit all of the Epic development tools (UnrealGameSync, for example) to work with git.\n\nWe sincerely wish we had a single consolidated version control system and code review workflow, but it is not a trivial exercise.\n\nSpotlight: Consolidated Repos\n\nOne of the issues we faced with git was that it was too easy and convenient to create new repositories, causing a proliferation of them. The biggest issue we faced was the inability to make changes that cross-cut different services at once. This created a lot of production overhead and reduced our ability to consolidate the behavior of services.\n\nWe considered switching to a full “monorepo” but many of us were unfamiliar with it and feared additional complexity and overhead that we had no additional development capacity to support.\n\nThe compromise we reached was a handful of consolidated repos in which many individual git repositories were merged into a single repository and then archived. All the microservices ended up in this single repository, but they could be developed, built, tested and deployed in isolation. This made it much easier to modify code across services (such as version dependencies) as well as simplifying the creation of libraries. This approach facilitated an incremental externalization of common functionality into modules that could be more easily reused across services, reducing copy/paste code duplication and reducing our maintenance costs.\n\nSaaS-y Open Source\n\nOne common theme you might have noticed in our architecture is that we prefer to depend on software that is open source and that we could host ourselves if we wanted/needed to. We also prefer to rely on a SaaS vendor that provides and manages this software for us instead of running it ourselves.\n\nThis offers us several advantages:\n\nWe are not locked into a particular cloud or vendor provider (as we could run the system ourselves if we needed to).\n\nWe can provision systems more quickly (our people don’t need to learn the intricacies of configuring them).\n\nLeverage vendor expertise to fix issues and/or edge cases when we encounter them.\n\nKeeps the vendor prices under control under our threat of shutting down our vendor contract and hosting the system ourselves.\n\nWe deviated from this posture only rarely and when there was no open source alternative that made sense for our business needs. However, we do believe this paradigm worked well for us and provides a way to fund and support further development of these open source projects. This, in turn, lowers our future risks by helping make the development of these open projects more sustainable (as these hosting vendors often employ contributors to the open source projects and continue to fund their contributions for mutually symbiotic benefit).\n\nConclusions\n\nIt’s rare to get access to the source code that makes up video games, so it’s rare to have the opportunity to learn directly from it. Even rarer is a view into the decisions and tradeoffs, the lessons learned, the paths not taken and those taken but with later regret.\n\nWe hope that this deep-dive on the challenges and successes of creating Palia’s software architecture provides some insight and inspiration for others facing similar challenges.\n\nIf you have any questions about Palia’s software architecture and development, or simply if you want to start a conversation feel free to reach out to us at hello@singularity6.com.\n\nSpecial Thanks\n\nThe list of people that contributed to this architecture is very long (see the Palia credits for the full list) and we wouldn’t do it justice to replicate it here.

We may ask for your consent for certain processing activities. You may withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future by contacting us through the relevant Service . Once we have received notification of withdrawal of consent, we will promptly cease processing your information for the purpose(s) you consented to, unless we have another legal basis to continue doing so. Withdrawal of consent does not, however, affect the lawfulness of the processing based on the consent prior to withdrawal.\n\nWhere we do not seek consent for processing, the processing of your personal data relies on the requirement of the processing for initiating or performing a contract with you or on our legitimate interest in the particular processing. Our legitimate interests also include compliance with legal regulations, insofar as this is not already recognized as a legal basis by applicable data protection law. This also includes the marketing of our products and services, the interest in better understanding our markets and in managing and further developing Palia, our other Services, and Singularity 6, including its operations, safely and efficiently.\n\nWe may process your data on other legal bases, for example, in the event of a dispute, as required in relation to a potential litigation or for the enforcement or defense of legal claims. We will communicate to you separately as necessary where such other legal bases may apply.\n\n4. What applies in case of personalization?\n\nWe may automatically evaluate personal aspects relating to you, where we wish to determine preference data, but also to detect misuse and security risks, to perform statistical analysis or for operational planning. We may also create profiles for these purposes, i.e., we may combine behavioral and preference data, but also master data, contract data and technical data relating to you in order to better understand you as a person and your experiences with our game.\n\nIn this case, we pay attention to the proportionality and reliability of the results and take measures against misuse of these profiles. Where these can produce legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affect you, we ensure human review.\n\n5. How do we share your data?\n\nIn relation to our contracts, websites, products and all other Services, our legal obligations or otherwise with protecting our legitimate interests and the other purposes, we may disclose your personal data to different parties, including:\n\nService providers: We may work with service providers in the US, Europe and other regions who process your data on our behalf. This includes for example hosting services. We disclose personal information to these service providers for a business purpose as legally permissible.\n\nParties you Authorize, Access, or Authenticate: Third parties you access through the services, social media services you use or other users with whom you communicate. For example, we work with businesses such as Stripe, in which case we do not share personal data, but allow the players or visitors to share their personal data directly with these parties. We then receive transactional information from the business e.g., if the payment or age verification was successful.\n\nContractual partners: This refers to contractual partners we may enter into partnerships or other contractual relationships with. For example, they may receive pseudonymized or anonymized registration data in relation to issued and redeemed vouchers or invitations. These recipients may also include contractual partners with whom we cooperate or who carry out advertising for us and to whom we may therefore disclose anonymized or pseudonymized data about you for analysis and marketing purposes.\n\nAuthorities: We may disclose personal data to agencies, courts and other authorities in the US and abroad if we are legally obliged or entitled to make such disclosures or if it appears necessary to protect our interests.\n\nDisclosure in Merger, Sale or Other Asset Transfer: In the event of a reorganization, dissolution, merger, sale or bankruptcy, we may transfer any information we collect to relevant third parties and will obtain your consent to do so where required.\n\nOther persons: This means other cases where interactions with third parties follows from the purposes, for example service recipients, the media and associations in which we participate or if you are included in one of our publications.\n\nIn addition, we enable certain third parties to collect personal data from you on our website and in our Services. Where we have no control over these data collections, these third parties are sole controllers.\n\n6. Is your personal data disclosed abroad?\n\nWhen you use our Services or access our websites, we may collect personal data about you which may be transferred, processed and/or accessed by us in the United States or any other country in which we or our service providers operate. Please be aware that the privacy laws and standards in certain countries, including the rights of government authorities to access your personal information, may differ from those in the country in which you reside.

      "# [How Singularity 6’s ‘Palia’ Conquered Cross-Regional Gaming with Amazon EKS and Karpenter on 2024-05-07](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/gametech/how-singularity-6s-palia-conquered-cross-regional-gaming-with-amazon-eks-and-karpenter/)\nIntroduction\n\nDeveloping an online multiplayer game capable of supporting thousands of concurrent players is an incredibly complex endeavor. For Singularity 6 (S6), creators of the hit game “Palia,” which released across platforms in 2023 and 2024—their developers needed to craft an immersive and captivating gaming experience while managing the vast resources and infrastructure required to keep the game’s services running smoothly.\n\nThroughout the development process, unforeseen obstacles and hurdles arose, testing the team’s resilience and problem-solving abilities. Furthermore, launching globally across console and PC platforms introduced an additional layer of intricacy, requiring planning and execution to ensure a seamless experience for players worldwide. To boost their small infrastructure team, S6 leveraged Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) and Karpenter’s flexibility and elasticity while minimizing cost—allowing Palia to reach over 3 million players in six months, in three different Regions, and across four distribution platforms.\n\nThis article describes the process the team at Singularity 6 used to make the Palia launch smooth and successful.\n\nOverview of Palia’s AWS infrastructure\n\nEarly on, Singularity 6 made the decision to host Palia on Amazon Web Services (AWS). As an online multiplayer game, the team understood that Palia needed a “cloud-first” approach. Today, Palia runs using Amazon EKS in three AWS Regions: US West (Oregon) – us-west-2, Asia Pacific (Tokyo) – ap-northeast-1, Europe (Frankfurt) – eu-central-1.\n\nPalia’s backend services run inside an EKS cluster, including the game servers powered by Unreal Engine. For persisting player state across a shared world, Palia relies on ScyllaDB as the database layer. ScyllaDB is highly scalable and designed from the start to be distributed and fast, trading speed for eventual consistency. Palia’s external traffic is routed through a geo-load balanced domain name system (DNS) address to a Network Load Balancer (NLB).\n\nReleasing Palia\n\nDuring Palia’s development, its cloud infrastructure was built entirely in a single datacenter: US West (Oregon). Singularity 6 knew that the studio would eventually need to release Palia in other Regions to reduce latency and improve the player experience. Load testing their system was also necessary to ensure a smooth rollout. Still, there was fear that there were not enough players in alpha tests to accurately simulate launch numbers.\n\nThe team used this opportunity to clone part of their production cloud infrastructure to Frankfurt. As the launch window approached, Palia released in the US first, while leveraging Frankfurt as their load and stress testing cluster, then ran a ScyllaDB copy to evaluate the latency of their queries across Regions on different continents. This “dark multiregional rollout” at the start greatly reduced risks when the game began operating in a multi-regional setting later as the S6 team could gather information on real player behavior.\n\nLoad testing\n\nBefore Palia had any players, Singularity 6 simulated them by writing load tests against their microservices using Locust. Their major focus was stress testing critical backend components, particularly ones that rely on other services to function. To generate sufficient load, S6 wrote a Locust test, ran it from within the Amazon EKS cluster, and then scaled it rapidly and effectively while gathering data that showed how the test systems responded. Using this method, the team identified inefficient code paths, balanced resource requests and limits, and tweaked auto scaling metrics.\n\nChaos testing with Litmus\n\nAfter Singularity 6 saw how their services responded to large volumes of requests, the team decided to inject some chaos into their tests. Their goal was to conduct experiments and observe how the rest of the system responded – especially for critical systems where an outage might cause a cascading failure. Using Litmus, S6 injected latency, created network isolation, and caused outages for specific services. Along the way, S6 constantly asked themselves, “Can we still play Palia?” Chaos testing helped build confidence because the team learned that once players were in-game, many types of chaos had little to no effect on them.\n\nRelease\n\nAhead of launch, Palia’s developers added and tested infrastructure to ensure they could match their player’s demands. Even with all their prep work, S6 encountered rough edges amid successes during their launch.\n\nIssue: Poor VPC planning\n\nWhen Singularity 6 started using Amazon EKS, the team already had a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) module written in Terraform. The module was not perfect, but S6 decided it was good enough to move forward without major changes. However, the team realized that this was the wrong decision within hours of launching Palia when an alert on pending pods revealed that the game had run out of IP addresses in its VPC’s subnets. S6 knew they could add additional subnets to the VPC, but didn’t notice any lines of code that might eventually cause issues in the EKS Terraform module.\n\nThe issue was they were concatenating all their private subnet IDs and public subnet IDs to the EKS cluster’s subnet IDs. When the team added new subnets to the VPC, they were also expanding the EKS cluster control plane onto these subnets. This caused issues when the cluster needed to upgrade or when a managed node group needed to roll its instances.\n\nIn summary, an initial lack of VPC planning led to a proliferation of many unique managed node groups in Singularity 6’s environment. This made it harder to make changes to the EKS cluster as the node groups changed. Below, Singularity 6 discusses how using Karpenter helped reduce their usage of managed node groups, which helped to solve this issue.\n\nSuccess: Templated resource requests and limits\n\nDuring the early ramp up, the team encountered an incident where a component of their Linkerd stack was impacted from running out of memory (OOM). Despite having multiple replicas of this component, they saw other side effects of the OOMKill pod shutdowns, which meant they needed to act quickly. Within a few minutes, the team identified the component being killed and they were able to patch the resource requests to higher limits.\n\nLuckily, S6 had accounted for this issue by adding templating in their Helm and Kustomize to account for setting resource requests and limits. An extra few hours of development work proved instrumental for patching the system while it was scaling and allowing for a smooth experience for their players.\n\nPost release: Adding new Regions\n\nAfter Palia’s release in US West (Oregon), the team finished their infrastructure in Frankfurt and started work to expand further in Tokyo. This was in preparation for Palia’s Nintendo Switch launch, which would bring in substantial new players from Asia. The team knew that providing game servers and services closer to their players would be instrumental to the game’s success, so getting Asia Pacific (Tokyo) online was a natural next step.\n\nIssue: Lack of instance diversity\n\nPalia’s backend, particularly the game servers, requires either a “many nodes with fewer vCPUs” or “fewer nodes with more vCPU” approach. In the Asia Pacific (Tokyo) Region, the team found that their preferred instance types had limited availability than either Oregon or Frankfurt. To solve for this, they decided to explore the use of Karpenter.\n\nSuccess: Using Kustomize for DRY configuration\n\nAdding new Regions revealed an obvious issue in their Gitops-style setup of ArgoCD. Namely, keeping their config (microservice version numbers, chart versions, resource requests and limits) in sync across multiple clusters.\n\nTo solve this, the team turned to Kustomize to further “customize” their DRY configurations and centralize changes such as bumping version numbers. Kustomize allowed S6 to define a single file that contained the version of both the game server and microservices. ArgoCD has excelled at noticing git repo changes and deploying updates to all regions.\n\nUsing Karpenter\n\nAt the end of October 2023, Karpenter moved to a beta readiness. At the time, Singularity 6 was using the cluster-autoscaler and formed several hypotheses that using Karpenter to manage their EKS instances closer to the control plane would provide several benefits, including:\n\nIt removed almost all of the managed node groups by reducing the burden of updating them as the cluster changed.\n\nIt granted the ability to quickly test additional instance configurations such as family, size, and architecture.\n\nIt allowed flexibility to easily adapt to Regions that lack a particular instance type.\n\nIt provided a more nuanced view of the cluster to start instances just-in-time and reduce their idle CPU.\n\nSuccess: Flexibility, experimentation, and idle costs\n\nInitially, Singularity 6 hypothesized that using Karpenter would give them flexibility across instance types, sizes, and even CPU architecture. For example, the team thought it would be straightforward to experiment running Palia on Graviton instances (with ARM processors) without any Terraform changes to managed node groups. Karpenter also streamlined issues with instance constraints in a Region like Tokyo. Finally, by configuring Karpenter to use varied instance sizes and families, S6 was able to run a cluster without any of the overhead of multiple Terraform-defined managed node groups.\n\nUsing Karpenter with its NodePool resource resulted in a reduction of idle game servers in their clusters. By configuring a more diverse set of instances, Singularity 6 was able to decrease idle cost by 75%.\n\nSuccess: Karpenter accelerates Kubernetes upgrades\n\nSwitching to Karpenter removed the need for almost all of their managed node groups. They no longer had an EKS cluster with hundreds of instances across several managed node groups. This simplification, as well as using control_plane_subnet_ids, allowed the team to more easily upgrade their EKS clusters to newer versions of Kubernetes. With fewer instances to launch and less “node group overhead” in their Terraform module, S6 was able to upgrade from K8s v1.26 to v1.28 across six EKS clusters in a few hours.\n\nConclusion\n\nFrom the player’s perspective, Palia’s PC launch went smoothly. The team performed load testing and chaos testing, which ensured the systems scaled properly. The elasticity of AWS offerings proved invaluable for this as they were able to double server capacity from 25 to 50 EC2 instances within hours across multiple Regions. Despite Singularity 6’s best efforts, they still ran into issues due to design choices made very early on.\n\nFollowing Palia’s PC release, Singularity 6’s choice to focus on improving Terraform, Kustomize, and Karpenter, allowed them to rapidly add new Regions to the game and to improve their launch on Nintendo Switch. Again, AWS availability in multiple Regions allowed the team to move from a single Region to a world-wide infrastructure in a matter of months. Moreover, by moving configuration out of Terraform and EKS and into Karpenter, they were able to adapt to resource constraints and more quickly conduct experiments.\n\nIf you are curious about more details about the Palia software architecture, head over to the Singularity 6 blog for a more in-depth overview of this topic.\n\nA special thank you to the Singularity 6 team who contributed to this architecture and blog post: Emily Price, Kyle Allan, Marc Tamsky, Matthew Walter, George Lin, Alec Nunn, Maciej Ciezki, Brian Tomlinson, and Stefano Mazzocchi.",

However, despite a myriad of updated content added in time for the latest platform addition in Palia’s repertoire, the reviews remain firmly seated in the ‘mixed’ category.\n\nPatch 0.178 has bloomed (pun intended), and now Palia players can gather flower seeds by capturing bugs, attempt to conquer the Temple of the Roots, finally get their hands on the remaining Emberborn furniture pieces, and even pretend to get married in Bride and Groom attire.\n\nThough the biggest news to come out of Patch 0.178 and Palia’s Steam debut is the massive — both literally and figuratively — Frogbert. This plush grew to this gargantuan size thanks to a huge number of people adding Palia to their wishlist on Steam prior to release and will now be waiting for anyone who plays, new and veteran players alike.\n\nHowever, there is a dark cloud looming over the Steam release of Palia with the accompanying mixed reviews. The feedback comes from new and old players alike, but the biggest stand-out complaints include:\n\nOverpriced Premium Store items, with one bundle of purely cosmetic items costing more than major new releases and no way to earn cosmetic items in-game\n\nLack of ability to link Palia and Steam accounts if you’ve already opened the game, losing any progress made on other platforms permanently\n\nUpdates launched too quickly, many of which have rendered a previously functioning feature completely broken\n\nSevere lack of end-game content, despite the countless updates that have been received\n\nGame not advertised as beta or early access on Steam, despite this status never officially being dropped by developers\n\nFor an MMO, there is a severe lack of multiplayer content (unless you enjoy cooking)\n\nThese are just a few of the most prominent complaints that are coming up time and again in the review section of the Palia store page on Steam, and having spent over 200 hours in the game myself, I have to admit that I can see where they’re coming from.\n\nThese are the same issues that caused me to stop playing two months into the open beta. And although I rushed to download the game on Steam, hoping to try the numerous updates and hotfixes implemented, the negative reviews coupled with my own less-than-enjoyable experience with the game mean it’s going to sit in my library unplayed for a good while yet.",

      "# [Palia’s black market card game is causing player arguments by Cass Marshall on 2024-07-25](https://www.polygon.com/24206154/palia-hot-pot-card-game-arguments)\nLately, there’s been a strangely hostile underbelly in super cozy life sim Palia — and I’m not talking about the hidden cartel gambling pit under the inn. Developer Singularity 6 recently added a cute and simple card game for players to enjoy, called Hot Pot. What should have been another fun diversion in the Stardew Valley-style game has instead revealed a split in the player base.\n\nPalia takes place in the cozy Kilima Village, where players can hang out with the townsfolk, farm, cook, or head out and explore the nearby bustling Bahari Bay. At night, an underground market opens up under the town store. The shopkeep, a cheerful cat-man smuggler, runs the night market from 6 p.m. to 3 a.m.\n\nHere, players can find fancy new toilets, rugs, and paintings for sale, or fish with friends. The main attraction, though, is playing the Hot Pot card game. Playing awards one coin, winning grants two, and after the games wrap up players can queue to spend their coins at a prize wheel. One spin of the wheel costs two coins, and players can win high-end cooking ingredients, adorable plushies, or cool pirate decor.\n\nMany players like to enjoy the underground market as a chill social stop. After hunting in Bahari or talking with all the villagers in Kilima, it can be nice to unwind with a little Hot Pot. The minigame isn’t particularly demanding or competitive; you go around a table of four, trading tiles, until one player has collected three sets of three matching tiles.\n\nA certain faction of players prefers to play “fast” games, though, going around the table as quickly as possible. When one player is about to win, they call out the card they need, and someone else at the table trades it in. This style of play is designed to produce as many coins as possible. If people are sharing tiles, there are no prolonged end-game standoffs, and everyone earns more coins. And when one fast table sets up, and starts filling the chat near the tables with callouts, it can lead to a fight.\n\nOver the past few days, I’ve had multiple sessions of Hot Pot be interrupted by neighboring tables breaking out into arguments. The dialogue usually boils down to “Hey, you’re cheating!” and “No, we’re working together.” Of course, having a public argument is unproductive at the best of times; having one in an online game where everyone is subjected to the back-and-forth due to proximity chat rarely goes well. Everyone in Palia is polite on the surface, during daylight. But at night, fast table debates can break out, and next thing you know the chat is filled with accusations and unsavory insults.\n\nThis argument is part of the tension of Palia; it’s an online sandbox that’s meant to sustain a community, but it’s also a very chill and low-key experience that’s often best enjoyed solo. Most of the time, this works, and the player base is very well behaved. After Hot Pot games, players will line up to spend their coins and spin the wheel, and it’s considered a faux pas to run up and join a game at a table with four players already there. But the fast table debate has broken down the usual etiquette and civility, and I’m curious to see how — or if — Singularity 6 tackles these clashing priorities between players.",
