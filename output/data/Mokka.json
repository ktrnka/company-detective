      "# Post ID p1k957: To the \"I must not be overtaken\" driver now more people are back in the office with +2476 score by [(gnowad, Reddit, 2021-08-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/britishproblems/comments/p1k957/to_the_i_must_not_be_overtaken_driver_now_more/)\nIf you're going to drive in the inside lane at 60mph on a 70 road, good for you, thanks for not speeding. If you're going to overtake at 60mph, it's annoying for those doing 70 but again thanks for not speeding. But don't then start trying to match my speed, or start speeding up as I'm passing performing an overtake. I didn't tailgate, I didn't flash you, I just want my adaptive cruise to do its thing and let me sit at the speed limit. Don't be a dick. Overtaking is allowed. You make people tailgate me because you're stopping me move in to the inside lane. And yes we know it's deliberate because when we do pass your speed suddenly drops back down and you're nowhere to be seen. Stick at 60 if you want. But don't be a prat.\n\n## Comment ID h8e6dda with +247 score by [(bishbosh1968, Reddit, 2021-08-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/britishproblems/comments/p1k957/to_the_i_must_not_be_overtaken_driver_now_more/h8e6dda/) (in reply to ID p1k957):\nThe worst, are the ones who sit on your rhs shoulder, as approach the back of the lorry. Neither accelerating,  or signalling to let you out. Happened to me recently,  on the A50. Put the indicator on for 4  or 5 seconds.  Still no reaction,  so I decided \"f@@k it, I am going!\" Starts with the headlights and waving.  Driving with the hood up. Banned driver? Either way, we bonded.\n\n### Comment ID h8ebrlg with +147 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-08-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/britishproblems/comments/p1k957/to_the_i_must_not_be_overtaken_driver_now_more/h8ebrlg/) (in reply to ID h8e6dda):\nThey’re lethal they are, cos they seem to want to coast in your blind spot. \n\nPisses me off that they zoom up to that spot but take an age just to overtake.

I pulled into the right lane to overtake what looked to be an older model car. I noticed they tried to speed up as I was going past but their engine was not capable of accelerating quickly when already at 65 mph. Not that mine is much better in my 1.4.. I overtake and pull back in to the middle lane (left lane is full). The chap in the car I had just overtaken has managed to get up to about 72 / 73 mph and is very slowly gaining on me. He then very very gradually overtakes me. No problem! If you are going faster then please feel free to go past. The ridiculous part was when he did eventually get a few inches in front, he aggressively pulled into my lane (no signal), causing me to brake quickly and then tried to slow even further, clearly trying to aggravate me... all because I overtook him...? It was two young lads but still makes me laugh to this day. It was one of the most pathetic things I have ever encountered.\n\n#### Comment ID h8eloqb with +54 score by [(Plumb789, Reddit, 2021-08-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/britishproblems/comments/p1k957/to_the_i_must_not_be_overtaken_driver_now_more/h8eloqb/) (in reply to ID h8efwai):\nYou're lucky that's only happened to you once!\n\n#### Comment ID h8fevvh with +23 score by [(Aether_Breeze, Reddit, 2021-08-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/britishproblems/comments/p1k957/to_the_i_must_not_be_overtaken_driver_now_more/h8fevvh/) (in reply to ID h8efwai):\nI, like OP, tend to sit with cruise control on for my daily commute and I hate these people.\n\nI pass then nicely and pull in, then suddenly they speed up and overtake only to slow down again.\n\nI spend the next 15 minutes performing leapfrog when I just want a nice drive home.\n\n#### Comment ID h8f7d65 with +16 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-08-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/britishproblems/comments/p1k957/to_the_i_must_not_be_overtaken_driver_now_more/h8f7d65/) (in reply to ID h8efwai):\nJust the other day I was stuck behind a car going 35 in a 40 A road so i got into the right hand lane to overtake and he almost crashed into a car in front that was turning into a garage because he didn't want me to overtake. Then at the next traffic lights he overtook again just to go 50-55 in a 60 (where most people go 60+) and continue going 30-35 in the next 40. Makes me wish my engine was bigger than 1L, so i could overtake these people easily.\n\n#### Comment ID h8f3u4z with +22 score by [(Clearandblue, Reddit, 2021-08-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/britishproblems/comments/p1k957/to_the_i_must_not_be_overtaken_driver_now_more/h8f3u4z/) (in reply to ID h8efwai):\nTry living abroad a while then returning to the UK and you'll see us Brits as passive aggressive little chumps who are happy to shoot ourselves in the foot if it means we can inconvenience a stranger.

I don't know how those signage systems are controlled and what flexibility they have but if it IS a system limitation then its ridiculous....\n\n### Comment ID h8ecgrm with +34 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-08-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/britishproblems/comments/p1k957/to_the_i_must_not_be_overtaken_driver_now_more/h8ecgrm/) (in reply to ID h8e95hd):\nI had one before that was 40mph on the motorway and it said \"40mph due to congestion\"\n\nIts only fucking congested because everyones seen the 40mph sign and slammed on because these shitty smart motorways have cameras in the gantry. \n\nIts almost a self-fulfilling prophecy.

I felt so incredibly vulnerable especially at 40 when other people around me were still happily doing 60/70mph. A few times I just debated doing 60/70 myself to not feel so vulnerable, but then there were the very fun average speed cameras and actual speed cameras to contend with, so not worth it.

Always Indian. (I’m surprised people kept taking his money). He insisted she have a licence even though she clearly should never have had one. The thought of her on the road was just horrific.

But usually you just pickup and carry on for a bit. The annoying bit is when you speed match as they overtake or next thing they are doing >80 and overtaking people only to be back at 60 within 3 mins.\n\nI get frustrated by those that speed up on two lanes up a hill sections. You think that 20mph over the speed limit isnt worth it so you back off and sit behind them and they go back to the 10 to 20mph under the limit.\n\nIf someone catches me at speed then I just let them go, even if I am on the motorbike and doing quite well.

They'd be driving at ludicrously slow speeds and I'd need to get past them then all of a sudden they'd remember they have an accelerator pedal.  It's an INCREDIBLY dangerous thing to do as I'd then end up being caught on the wrong side of the road with ongoing traffic.   If I was to crash it'd end up being certain death at last for oncoming car and me if not more people including possibly the idiot doing this in the first place.\n\nMost times I'd have to give up and go behind them again.  I wouldn't mind so much if my little attempt to overtake would make them realise they're being unreasonably slow and then speed up as I didn't necessarily want to get past them I just wanted to travel more quickly.  But it's the ones who'd then go just as slow as they were that really were the lowest of the low.\n\nSurprisingly 8/10 of them were female, which doesn't make sense as I thought it's more likely testosterone-driven idiot men like me would be more likely to get offended. \n\nYears of this nonsense and I finally worked hard enough and got lucky enough to afford cars with more grunt and I now (thankfully) can say with a Tesla Model X ludicrous with insane torque nothing can touch me and I've never felt safer.  It's a shame I've had to get an even faster car just to feel safe on UK roads.  Counterintuitive.\n\nWHat REALLY gets to me though, and I don't know if anyone else has noticed this, but since covid it's now VERY common for people to go much lower than the speed limit.\n\nPretty much every day I'm guaranteed to be going behind someone doing 24 (it's always 24 for some reason!) on a 30.   Or 34 on a 40.  Or 55 on a 60.   I'm genuinely confused.  I have several theories\n\n1) covid virus has somehow given a lot of people long covid and they have somehow lost the ability to read numbers, or have just lost some sort of coordination and fel unsafe at higher speeds\n\n2) the relative emptiness of the roads makes them think noone's in a rush\n\n3) there are more carers on the roads (as most others are stay at home) and they tend to be a demographic who drives a bit slower anyway possibly\n\n4) many people in lockdown just wanted to get out the house and drive around with nowhere in particular to go so aren't in a rush, and that's just reset what peopel do\n\n5) psychologically for some reason people think it's a special sort of situation so they feel they need to drive slowly to be extra safe\n\nIn any case it's something I've definitely noticed.\n\n## Comment ID h8fnjfi with +3 score by [(cyberspacedweller, Reddit, 2021-08-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/britishproblems/comments/p1k957/to_the_i_must_not_be_overtaken_driver_now_more/h8fnjfi/) (in reply to ID p1k957):\nHad a van doing 40 in a 50 a while back so decided to overtake.
