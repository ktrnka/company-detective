That said, I'm thinking about the same kind of thing in our company, though with likely a larger NVIDIA server. What you need to know, that no one seems to know here right now, is exactly how Ollama multi-user works. My assumption (yes, a guess, but I'm admitting it) is that it does not hog the entire server for one user until that user logs out and then gives it to another user. That would be silly. Instead it most likely processes messages in a queue-like fashion. Thus how many users it can depend on several variables, not all of which can be known at the start, including how long are the prompts that users will send, including any information they might upload or paste in, how long will the conversations get (conversation length has a quadratic relationship with response time I'm told), and finally, how often users send messages. Let's take your 1000 users. Say 100 are online and using the app at any given time. Assume that each of them sends an average of one message per 5 minutes (I mean they have to wait for the message to be processed, a response generated and then they have to read the response and maybe think about their next prompt, so 5 minutes may not be too far off--and not everyone is sending messages continuously--I often spend 10-15 minutes composing a prompt). Further assume that each message takes 30 seconds on average for the LLM to produce or stream the complete response (assuming one thread)--of course that will vary, but 30 seconds might make a reasonable average. With those assumptions. the user group of 100 active users will be sending 720 messages each hour in total. The LLM can process 120 messages per hour in the one thread. Thus we have a bit of a problem and the LLM will fall further and further behind until response times become unbearable. But let's say we can have just 50 active users, as I think you mentioned, and we can have two concurrent threads. Now we almost balance, with 100% duty cycle on the system. At least that's the way I'd think about it, and of course you need to do your own math and make your own assumptions.\n\n## Comment ID m82jhj4 with +4 score by [(None, Reddit, 2025-01-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ollama/comments/1i58ftc/ollama_server_limitation/m82jhj4/) (in reply to ID 1i58ftc):\n[removed]\n\n### Comment ID m84y158 with +2 score by [(JV_info, Reddit, 2025-01-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ollama/comments/1i58ftc/ollama_server_limitation/m84y158/) (in reply to ID m82jhj4):\nof course, we are going to use for example a 8B model and will only whitelist this model in OpenwebUI so no one can change the model so that there is only one model in the Vram....  \ndo you think it this setup, even with a bit of slowness 50 users can use it at the same time?\n\n## Comment ID m82d8de with +1 score by [(Any_Praline_8178, Reddit, 2025-01-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ollama/comments/1i58ftc/ollama_server_limitation/m82d8de/) (in reply to ID 1i58ftc):\nWhich models are you planning to run and with what context length?\n\n### Comment ID m84ykml with +1 score by [(JV_info, Reddit, 2025-01-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ollama/comments/1i58ftc/ollama_server_limitation/m84ykml/) (in reply to ID m82d8de):\nan 8b model.  \ncontext length idk yet as I thought this is something we have to check and figure out in action....  \nany idea?\n\n#### Comment ID m85q9pr with +1 score by [(Any_Praline_8178, Reddit, 2025-01-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ollama/comments/1i58ftc/ollama_server_limitation/m85q9pr/) (in reply to ID m84ykml):\nTo add some context here 128k context is about the size of a book.

Unless you plan to run those really small models like 1.3b. To make it simpler, imagine 1000 people going through same doorway at the same time, no choice but to queue. Sure you can do parallel like you mentioned but.. let's say there is 4 doors instead of just one door.

      "# [Engineering flexible machine learning systems by traversing functionally invariant paths by Surya Narayanan on 2024-10-03](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00902-x)\nArtificial neural networks now achieve human-level performance on machine learning tasks ranging from natural language understanding and image recognition to game playing and protein structure prediction. Recently, transformer-based models with self-attention have emerged as the state-of-the-art architecture across data modalities and task paradigms including natural language understanding, computer vision, audio processing, biological sequence analysis and context-sensitive reasoning1,2,3,4. Although transformer models can exhibit emergent behaviours including zero-shot task performance, models are commonly fine-tuned to increase performance and human accessibility4,5,6. In the ‘foundation model’ paradigm3, transformers with 108 to 1012 parameters are, first, pre-trained over large datasets on self-supervised tasks such as masked language modelling, causal language modelling or image masking5,6,7,8. Following self-supervised training, models are fine-tuned to increase performance on specific applications including question/answer or instruction following. Networks can be further sparsified or quantized to reduce memory and computation requirements in deployment environments.\n\nDue to the central role of model adaptation for foundation model optimization and deployment, many algorithms have emerged for updating model weights to increase performance without experiencing a catastrophic loss of the knowledge gained during self-supervised pre-training. However, a challenge is that in artificial neural networks, network function is encoded in the mathematical weights that determine the strength of connections between neural units (Fig. 1a,b). Gradient descent procedures train networks to solve problems by adjusting the weights of a network based on an objective function that encodes the performance of a network on a specific task. Learning methods, like backpropagation and low-rank adaptation (LoRA)9 gradient descent, adjust the network weights to define a single, optimal weight configuration to maximize performance on a task-specific objective function using training data. However, for all the current methods, network training alters network weights, inevitably resulting in the loss of information gained from previous training tasks or pre-training.\n\nAlthough many methods have been developed to achieve network adaptation without information loss, methods remain primarily grounded in empirical results. The machine learning community would benefit from mathematical tools that provide general insights and unification of model adaptation strategies within a common theoretical framework. Methods like LoRA, orthogonal gradient descent (OGD), relevance mapping networks (RMNs) and elastic weight consolidation (EWC) propose different criteria for updating weights in directions that do not impact performance on previously learned tasks. Yet, most current methods are based on local heuristics, for example, selecting gradient steps that are orthogonal to gradient steps taken for previously learned tasks. As in continual learning (CL) paradigms, sparsification frameworks execute heuristic prune/fine-train cycles to discover a compact, core subnetwork capable of executing the desired behaviour with decreased memory, power and computational requirements. Mathematical tools that provide a deeper insight into how the global, geometric structure of weight space enables or complicates adaptation might provide both conceptual principles and new algorithms.\n\nUnlike contemporary artificial neural nets, neural networks in the human brain perform multiple functions and can flexibly switch between different functional configurations based on context, goals or memory10. Neural networks in the brain are hypothesized to overcome the limitations of a single, optimal weight configuration and perform flexible tasks by continuously ‘drifting’ their neural firing states and neural weight configurations, effectively generating large ensembles of degenerate networks11,12,13,14,15. Fluctuations might enable flexibility in biological systems by allowing neural networks to explore a series of network configurations and responding to sensory input.\n\nHere we develop a geometric framework and algorithm that mimics aspects of biological neural networks by using differential geometry to construct path-connected sets of neural networks that solve a given machine learning task. Conceptually, we consider path-connected sets of neural networks, rather than single networks (isolated points in weight space) to be the central objects of study and application. By building sets of networks rather than single networks, we search within a submanifold of weight space for networks that solve a given machine learning problem and accommodate a broad range of secondary goals. Historically, results in theoretical machine learning and information geometry have pointed to the geometry of a model’s loss landscape as a potential resource for model adaptation. An emergent property of over-parameterized models is the existence of parameter degeneracy where multiple settings of the model parameters can achieve identical performance on a given task. Geometrically, parameter degeneracy leads16 to ‘flat’ objective functions17,18,19 along which network weights can be modified without loss of performance. To discover invariant subspaces, we introduce a Riemannian metric into weight space—a tensor that measures (at every point in parameter space) the change in the model output given an infinitesimal movement in model parameters. The metric provides a mathematical tool for identifying low-dimensional subspaces in weight space where parameter changes have little impact on how a neural network transforms input data. Riemannian metrics are widely used in physical theories to study the dynamics of particles on curved manifolds and spacetimes. Geometrically, the metric discovers flat directions in weight space along which we can translate a neural network without changing functional performance.\n\nUsing the Riemannian weight-space metric, we develop an algorithm that constructs functionally invariant paths (FIPs) in weight space that maintain network performance and ‘search out’ for other networks that satisfy additional objectives. The algorithm identifies long-range paths in weight space that can integrate new functionality without information loss. We apply the FIP framework to natural language (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT)), vision transformers (ViT and DeIT) and convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. Our framework generates results that meet or exceed state-of-the-art performance for adaptation and sparsification tasks on academic-grade hardware. Our approach provides mathematical machinery that yields insights into how low-dimensional geometric structures can be harnessed for model adaptation without information loss. More broadly, we consider language models as objects acted on by transformations in series and we show that the transformations of models are intrinsically non-Abelian. The unified framework provides a general attack on a range of model adaptation problems and reveals connections between the mathematical theory of differential geometries and the emergent properties of large language and vision models.\n\nWe develop a mathematical framework that allows us to define and explore path-connected sets of neural networks that have divergent weight values but similar outputs on training data. We view the weight space of a neural network as a Riemannian manifold equipped with a local distance metric20,21. Using differential geometry, we construct paths through weight space that maintain the functional performance of a neural network and adjust the network weights to flow along a secondary goal (Fig. 1a). The secondary goal can be general; therefore, the framework can be applied to train networks on new classification tasks, sparsify networks and mitigate adversarial fragility.\n\nThe defining feature of a Riemannian manifold is the existence of a local distance metric. We construct a distance metric in weight space that defines the distance between two nearby networks to be their difference in output. We consider a neural network to be a smooth function f(x; w) that maps an input vector \\({\\bf{x}}\\in {{\\mathbb{R}}}^{{\\rm{k}}}\\) to an output vector \\(f({\\bf{x}};{\\bf{w}})={\\bf{y}}\\in {{\\mathbb{R}}}^{{\\rm{m}}}\\), where the map is parameterized by a vector of weights \\({\\bf{w}}\\in {{\\mathbb{R}}}^{{\\rm{n}}}\\) that are typically set in training to solve a specific task. We refer to \\(W={{\\mathbb{R}}}^{n}\\) as the weight space of the network, and we refer to \\({\\mathcal{Y}}={{\\mathbb{R}}}^{m}\\) as the output space (Fig. 1b,c)22. For pedagogical purposes, we will consider the action of f on a single input x. Supplementary Note 1 shows that our results naturally extend to an arbitrary number of inputs xi.\n\nWe initially ask how the output f(x; w) of a given neural network changes for small changes in network weights. Given a neural network with weights wt and fixed input x, we can compute the output of the perturbed network wt + dw for an infinitesimal weight perturbation dw as follows:\n\n$$f({\\bf{x}},{{\\bf{w}}}_{{\\bf{t}}}+{\\bf{dw}})\\approx f({\\bf{x}},{{\\bf{w}}}_{{\\bf{t}}})+{{\\bf{J}}}_{{{\\bf{w}}}_{{\\bf{t}}}}\\,{\\bf{dw}},$$\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \\({{\\bf{J}}}_{{{\\bf{w}}}_{{\\bf{t}}}}\\) is the Jacobian of f(x, wt) for a fixed \\({\\bf{x}},{J}_{ij}=\\frac{\\partial {f}_{i}}{\\partial {w}_{j}}\\), evaluated at wt.\n\nThus, the total change in network output for a given weight perturbation dw is\n\n$$\\begin{array}{rcl}|\\; f({\\bf{x}},{{\\bf{w}}}_{{\\bf{t}}}+{\\bf{dw}})-f({\\bf{x}},{{\\bf{w}}}_{{\\bf{t}}}){| }^{2}&=&{{\\bf{dw}}}^{{{\\rm{T}}}}\\,(\\;{{\\bf{J}}}_{{{\\bf{w}}}_{{\\bf{t}}}}{({\\bf{x}})}^{{\\rm{T}}}\\,{{\\bf{J}}}_{{{\\bf{w}}}_{{\\bf{t}}}}({\\bf{x}}))\\,{\\bf{dw}}\\\\ | {\\langle {\\bf{dw}},{\\bf{dw}}\\rangle }_{{{\\bf{g}}}_{{{\\bf{w}}}_{{\\bf{t}}}}}{| }^{2}&=&{{\\bf{dw}}}^{{{\\rm{T}}}}\\,{{\\bf{g}}}_{{{\\bf{w}}}_{{\\bf{t}}}}({\\bf{x}})\\,{\\bf{dw}}\\end{array},$$\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \\({{\\bf{g}}}_{{{\\bf{w}}}_{{\\bf{t}}}}({\\bf{x}})={{\\bf{J}}}_{{{\\bf{w}}}_{{\\bf{t}}}}{({\\bf{x}})}^{{{\\rm{T}}}}\\,{{\\bf{J}}}_{{{\\bf{w}}}_{{\\bf{t}}}}({\\bf{x}})\\) is the metric tensor evaluated at the point wt ∈ W for a single data point x. The metric tensor is an n × n symmetric matrix that allows us to compute the change in network output given the movement of the network along any direction in weight space as \\({\\langle {\\bf{dw}},{\\bf{dw}}\\rangle }_{{{\\bf{g}}}_{{{\\bf{w}}}_{{\\bf{t}}}}({\\bf{x}})}\\). As we move through the weight space, the metric tensor W continuously changes, allowing us to compute the infinitesimal change in network output and move along a path γ(t) as the tangent vector \\(\\psi (t)=\\frac{\\,\\text{d}\\gamma (t)}{\\text{d}\\,t}\\).\n\nWe can extend the metric construction to cases in which we consider a set of N training data points X and view g as the mean of the metrics derived from individual training examples, such that \\({{\\bf{g}}}_{{\\bf{w}}({\\bf{X}})}={\\Sigma }_{i = 1}^{N}{{\\bf{g}}}_{{\\bf{w}}}({{\\bf{x}}}_{{\\bf{i}}})/N\\) for xi ∈ X or in expectation, \\({{\\bf{g}}}_{{\\bf{w}}}={{\\mathbb{E}}}_{x \\approx {p}_{{\\rm{data}}}(x)}[{{\\bf{g}}}_{{\\bf{w}}({\\bf{x}})}]\\), and gw(X) remains n × n (Supplementary Note 1). For a single data point, our construction of gw is identical to the neural tangent kernel (NTK), which is constructed as a kernel function of pairs of data points, \\(\\varTheta ({x}_{i},{x}_{j})=J{({x}_{i})}^{{{\\rm{T}}}}J({x}_{j})\\) (ref. 23), so that Θ(xi, xi) = gi(xi) (refs. 23,24,25,26). However, we distinguish our interpretation of g as a distance metric on W, the network parameter space from the NTK as a matrix-valued kernel function on data points xi and xj. The NTK Θ(xi, xj) arises through the analysis of the dynamics of a neural network under a gradient flow of the mean squared error. The NTK is interpreted as a kernel function defined on pairs of data points xi and xj, providing an analogy between the training dynamics of a neural network and kernel-based learning methods. Alternately, we interpret gw as a metric on a Riemannian parameter manifold (W, gw). At each point in the weight space, the metric defines the length, \\({\\langle {\\bf{dw}},{\\bf{dw}}\\rangle }_{{{\\bf{g}}}_{{\\bf{w}}}}\\), of a local perturbation to network weights dw as the perturbation’s impact on the functional output of the network (Fig. 1b,c) averaged over all the data points in X. The metric motivates the construction and analysis of network paths in weight space and consideration of properties including velocity, acceleration and notion of a geodesic path in weight space.\n\nAt every point in the weight space, the metric allows us to discover directions dw of movement that have a large or small impact on the output of a network. As we move along a path γ(t) ⊂ W in weight space, we sample a series of neural networks over time t. Using the metric, we can define a notion of ‘output velocity’ as \\({\\bf{v}}=\\frac{\\,\\text{d}\\,f({\\bf{x}},\\gamma (t))}{\\,\\text{dt}\\,}\\), which quantifies the distance a network moves in output space for each local movement along the weight-space path γ(t). We seek to identify FIPs in weight space along which the output velocity is minimized for a fixed magnitude change in weight. To do so, we solve the following optimization problem:\n\n$$\\begin{array}{c}{\\psi }^{* }(t)=\\mathop{{\\mathrm{argmin }}}\\limits_{\\frac{{\\rm{d}}\\gamma }{{\\rm{d}}t}}{\\left\\langle \\frac{{\\rm{d}}\\gamma }{{\\rm{d}}t},\\frac{{\\rm{d}}\\gamma }{{\\rm{d}}t}\\right\\rangle }_{{{\\bf{g}}}_{\\gamma ({\\bf{t}})}}\\\\ \\,\\text{such that}\\,\\,{\\left\\langle \\frac{{\\rm{d}}\\gamma }{{\\rm{d}}t},\\frac{{\\rm{d}}\\gamma }{{\\rm{d}}t}\\right\\rangle }_{I}=\\epsilon \\end{array},$$\n\n(3)\n\nwhere we attempt to find a direction ψ*(t) along which to perturb the network, such that it is ϵ units away from the base network in the weight space (in the Euclidean sense, \\({\\langle \\frac{{\\rm{d}}\\gamma }{{\\rm{d}}t},\\frac{{\\rm{d}}\\gamma }{{\\rm{d}}t}\\rangle }_{I}=\\epsilon\\)) and minimize the distance moved in the networks’ output space, given by \\({\\langle \\frac{{\\rm{d}}\\gamma }{{\\rm{d}}t},\\frac{{\\rm{d}}\\gamma }{{\\rm{d}}t}\\rangle }_{{{\\bf{g}}}_{\\gamma }({\\bf{t}})}\\). Here I is an identity matrix, with the inner product \\({\\langle \\frac{{\\rm{d}}\\gamma }{{\\rm{d}}t},\\frac{{\\rm{d}}\\gamma }{{\\rm{d}}t}\\rangle }_{I}\\) capturing the Euclidean distance in weight space27. The optimization problem is a quadratic program at each point in weight space. The metric g is a matrix that takes on a specific value at each point in weight space, and we aim to identify vectors \\({{\\bf{\\psi }}}^{* }(t)=\\frac{{\\rm{d}}\\gamma (t)}{{\\rm{d}}t}\\) that minimize the change in the functional output of the network.\n\nWe will often amend the optimization problem with a second objective function L(x, w). We can enumerate paths that minimize the functional velocity in the output space and move along the gradient of the second objective (∇wL). We define a path-finding algorithm that identifies a direction ψ*(t) in the weight space by minimizing the functional velocity in the output space and moves along the gradient of the second objective (∇wL):\n\n$$\\begin{array}{rcl}&&{\\psi }^{* }(t)=\\mathop{{\\mathrm{argmin }}}\\limits_{\\frac{{\\rm{d}}\\gamma }{{\\rm{d}}t}}\\left({\\left\\langle \\frac{{\\rm{d}}\\gamma }{{\\rm{d}}t},\\frac{{\\rm{d}}\\gamma }{{\\rm{d}}t}\\right\\rangle }_{{{\\bf{g}}}_{\\gamma (t)}}+\\beta {\\left\\langle \\frac{{\\rm{d}}\\gamma }{{\\rm{d}}t},{\\nabla }_{{\\bf{w}}}L\\right\\rangle }_{I}\\right)\\\\ &&\\,\\text{such that}\\,{\\left\\langle \\frac{{\\rm{d}}\\gamma }{{\\rm{d}}t},\\frac{{\\rm{d}}\\gamma }{{\\rm{d}}t}\\right\\rangle }_{I}=\\epsilon \\end{array} ,$$\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the first term \\({\\langle \\frac{{\\rm{d}}\\gamma }{{\\rm{d}}t},\\frac{{\\rm{d}}\\gamma }{{\\rm{d}}t}\\rangle }_{{{\\bf{g}}}_{\\gamma (t)}}\\) identifies functionally invariant directions, the second term \\({\\langle \\frac{{\\rm{d}}\\gamma }{{\\rm{d}}t},{\\nabla }_{{\\bf{w}}}L\\rangle }_{I}\\) biases the direction of motion along the gradient of a second objective and β weighs the relative contribution of the two terms. When L = 0, the algorithm merely constructs paths in weight space that are approximately isofunctional (θ*(t) = ψ*(t)), that is, the path is generated by steps in the weight space comprising networks with different weight configurations and preserving the input–output map. L(x, w) can also represent the loss function of a second task, for example, a second input classification problem. In this case, we identify vectors that simultaneously maintain performance on an existing task (via term 1) as well as improve performance on a second task by moving along the negative gradient of the second-task loss function ∇wL. We consider constructing FIPs with different objective functions (L(x, w)) similar to applying different ‘operations’ to neural networks that identify submanifolds in the weight space of the network accomplishing distinct tasks of interest.\n\nTo approximate the solution to equation (4), in large neural networks, we developed a numerical strategy that samples points in an ϵ ball around a given weight configuration, and then performs gradient descent to identify vectors θ*(t). We note that the performance of a neural network on a task is typically evaluated using a loss function \\(L:{{\\mathbb{R}}}^{m}\\to {\\mathbb{R}}\\), so that \\(L(\\;f({\\bf{x}};{\\bf{w}}))\\in {\\mathbb{R}}\\). Networks with a constant functional output f(x, w) along a path γ(t) will also have constant loss L(f(γ(t); w)). As gradient descent training minimizes the loss by finding \\(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial {w}_{i}}=0\\), the evaluation of loss curvature requires second-order methods to discover flat or functionally invariant subspaces. We find that working directly with f(x; w) allows us to identify functionally invariant subspaces through first-order quantities \\(\\frac{\\partial {f}_{i}}{\\partial {w}_{j}}={J}_{ij}\\), and thus, we can compute the metric using the output of automatic differentiation procedures commonly used in training. Working with f(x, w) instead of L also provides additional resolution in finding invariant subspaces since f(x; w) is often a vector-valued versus scalar-valued function.\n\nWe note that the mathematical framework provides avenues for immediate generalization to consider paths of constant velocity, paths that induce a constant rate of performance change; such paths are known as geodesics28. On any Riemannian manifold, we can define geodesic paths emanating from a point xp as paths of constant velocity \\({\\langle \\frac{{\\rm{d}}\\gamma }{{\\rm{d}}t},\\frac{{\\rm{d}}\\gamma }{{\\rm{d}}t}\\rangle }_{{{\\bf{g}}}_{\\gamma (t)}}={v}_{0}\\) (Supplementary Note 4.1) that satisfy the following geodesic equation:\n\n$$\\frac{{{\\rm{d}}}^{2}{w}_{\\eta }}{{\\rm{d}}{t}^{2}}+{\\varGamma }_{\\mu \\nu }^{\\eta }\\frac{{\\rm{d}}{w}_{\\mu }}{{\\rm{d}}t}\\frac{{\\rm{d}}{w}_{\\nu }}{{\\rm{d}}t}=0,$$\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \\({\\varGamma }_{\\mu \\nu }^{\\eta }\\) specifies the Christoffel symbols (\\({\\varGamma }_{\\mu \\nu }^{\\eta }={\\sum }_{r}\\frac{1}{2}{g}_{\\eta r}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{\\partial {g}_{r\\mu }}{\\partial {x}^{\\nu }}+\\right.\\)\\(\\left.\\frac{\\partial {g}_{r\\nu }}{\\partial {x}^{\\mu }}-\\frac{\\partial {g}_{\\mu \\nu }}{\\partial {x}^{r}}\\right)\\)) on the weight manifold. Such geodesic paths have a constant, potentially non-zero, rate of performance decay on the previous task during adaptation. The Christoffel symbols record infinitesimal changes in the metric tensor (g) along a set of directions on the manifold (Supplementary Information). Since the computation and memory for evaluating Christoffel symbols scales as a third-order polynomial of network parameters (\\({\\mathcal{O}}({n}^{3})\\)), we propose the optimization equation (4) for evaluating ‘approximate’ geodesics in the manifold.\n\nFIP enables CL with ViT vision transformers\n\nThe FIP framework allows us to address a series of model adaptation goals within a common geometric framework. To demonstrate CL, we applied the FIP to adapt the ViT vision image transformer and BERT language model in CL without catastrophic forgetting. We train a neural network on a base task and modulate the weights in the network to accommodate additional tasks by solving the optimization problem in equation (4), setting L(x, w) as the classification loss function specified by the additional task, whereas \\({\\langle \\frac{{\\rm{d}}\\gamma }{{\\rm{d}}t},\\frac{{\\rm{d}}\\gamma }{{\\rm{d}}t}\\rangle }_{{{\\bf{g}}}_{{\\rm{Task}}1}}\\) measures the distance moved in the networks’ output using the metric from the initial task (in equation (4)). To accommodate the additional tasks, we append output nodes to the base network and solve the optimization problem for a fixed value of β by simultaneously minimizing the distance moved in the networks’ output space (Fig. 1c, light-blue arrow) corresponding to the first task and maximizing alignment with the gradient of L(x, w) encoding the classification loss from the second task. In this manner, we construct an FIP (Fig. 5a, purple dotted line) in weight space generating a network that performs both Task 1 and Task 2.\n\nWe used a standard CL task30 (Fig. 2a). We split the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR)-100 dataset into a series of subtasks in which each subtask requires the network to identify ten object categories (Fig. 2a). Previously, the state-of-the-art performance for this task was achieved by the ResNet CNN30. ViT networks can potentially realize vast performance gains over ResNet architectures as the baseline performance for ResNet is ~80% accuracy. We observed that ViT exhibits 94.5% accuracy when fine-tuned on the CIFAR-100 dataset8,31 for generative replay, achieving a CIFAR-100 CL accuracy of ~80%.\n\nWe applied the FIP algorithm to achieve CL on SplitCIFAR using both ViT-B (86M parameters) and ViT-H (632M parameters) architectures. In each case, a single task requires the network to learn to recognize 10 CIFAR classes where we used 5,000 images (total, 6,000 images) per class with a batch size of 512. We used a single NVIDIA RTX2060 6 GB for ViT-B and RTX3090 24 GB for ViT-H (Fig. 2b). After continually training 5 SplitCIFAR subtasks, ViT-B achieved a mean performance of 91.2% and ViT-H achieved 89.3% compared with 94.5% performance for ViT-B that was simultaneously trained on all the 50 CIFAR classes without CL (Fig. 2b,c). Training for ViT-B using an NVIDIA RTX2060 6 GB machine took ~3.5 h for each subtask with the FIP and ~2.5 h with fine tuning. Training for ViT-H using an NVIDIA RTX3090 24 GB machine took ~4.8 h for each subtask with the FIP and ~3.9 h with standard fine tuning.\n\nThus, the FIP procedure enables ViT-B and ViT-H to learn new tasks without information loss and achieves a higher performance than CL methods that have been conventionally applied to the ResNet network31. The strength of our method is that it can be applied to fine-tune any existing transformer or CNN architecture.\n\nComparison of FIP with LoRA on CL with ViT\n\nThe LoRA approach to network fine tuning was recently introduced to enable the fine tuning of large transformer networks including GPT-3 (ref. 32). To fine-tune pre-trained networks on new tasks, LoRA forces weight updates W0 to a network to be low rank through a matrix factorization strategy, where W0 is generated as the product W0 = AB of matrices A and B with inner dimension r; here r is set to be a number much smaller than network size k (r ≪ k).\n\nAlthough not explicitly designed to alleviate catastrophic forgetting, LoRA is discussed in many venues including HuggingFace (HF) as a technique that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Further, LoRA is widely applied for fine-tuning tasks on large networks in industrial settings and therefore represents an important comparison point for FIP. We applied LoRA to iteratively learn components of the SplitCIFAR task (Fig. 2) using ViT-H (640M parameters) spanning a range of r = rank(W0) from 1 to 256. We found that LoRA exhibits signatures of catastrophic forgetting independent of rank in these tests (Fig. 2e,f). When ViT-H is trained to achieve 99% accuracy on Task 1 (CIFAR-0:9 task), the network loses accuracy on Task 1 as it is trained via LoRA on Task 2 (CIFAR-10:19 task) (Fig. 2e,f and Extended Data Table 1). Following the application of LoRA, ViT-H achieves 96.6% accuracy on Task 2 for r = 256 at the expense of 0% accuracy on Task 1 (Fig. 2e,f and Extended Data Table 1). When rank = 1, the LoRA accuracy was limited to 10% on Task 2 and still lost accuracy on Task 1 (Task 1 accuracy, 0%). Thus, LoRA fine tuning leads to a collapse in accuracy on Task 1 when fine-tuned to perform an additional task.\n\nPerformance of FIP on CL with CNN architectures\n\nIn addition to transformers, the FIP framework can also be applied to CNN architectures, which provides a helpful point of comparison with previous CL methods. On image analysis tasks like CIFAR-10, transformers like ViT outperform CNN architectures on classification accuracy metrics. However, CNNs are widely used in computer vision and have been the architecture used for most prior CL work. We applied FIP to ResNet18 to study CL on SplitCIFAR and compared with RES-CIFAR30, EWC33, RMN30, generative replay31 and gradient episodic memory (GEM)34. We found that the FIP could achieve CL with accuracy that meets or exceeds other state-of-the-art approaches (Fig. 2f, Extended Data Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2), with RMN achieving 80% accuracy on SplitCIFAR compared with 82% for FIP on ResNet14. In general, the global accuracy of the resulting CNN was lower than the transformer ViT, consistent with the network’s relative performance on the baseline CIFAR task. The results demonstrate that FIP performs well on transformer and CNN architectures and on par or above other state-of-the-art approaches. Although the FIP algorithm has conceptual similarities with EWC, the mathematical generality of the FIP allows the approach to scale to perform multiple iterative incremental learning tasks and to explicitly construct FIPs that traverse the weight space (Fig. 2d).\n\nFIP enables CL with BERT NLP transformer\n\nNext, we demonstrated the flexibility of the FIP approach by using the method to fine-tine the BERT network on the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) sentiment analysis task following initial training on Yelp full-five-star review prediction task (Fig. 3). The BERT network has a total of 12 layers, or transformer blocks, with 12 self-attention heads in each layer and a total of 110M parameters5. Training BERT to detect customer opinions of a product based on text reviews left on websites like Yelp or IMDb results in catastrophic forgetting, especially when sequentially training on multiple user-review datasets (say, Yelp reviews followed by IMDb) (Fig. 3a). The FIP maintains BERT performance on Yelp reviews (at 70%; blue) and increasing its accuracy on IMDb review classification (from 0% to 92%; orange) (Fig. 3b). Potentially, BERT has as an initial accuracy of 0% on IMDb due to differences in the outputs for each task, which are binary for IMDb but five-star scoring for Yelp. The FIP in BERT weight space (Fig. 3) is much longer than the route taken by conventional training, enabling the global exploration of the BERT weight landscape to identify networks that simultaneously maintain performance on Yelp reviews and learn the IMDb sentiment classification. Conventional fine tuning of BERT on IMDb reviews increases its performance on sentiment classification on IMDb (from 0% to 92%; orange) and abruptly forgets the sentiment analysis on Yelp reviews (dropping from an accuracy of 69.9% to 17%; blue) within 30 training steps (Fig. 3b). We also compared the performance of FIP with LoRA on the natural language processing (NLP) training task (Fig. 3d–f). We found that LoRA exhibits a considerable performance decay on the Yelp task and learning IMDb across ranks (Fig. 3d,f). LoRA also exhibits anticorrelation between Yelp and IMDb accuracy across training epochs (Fig. 3d). We also found that the FIP algorithm generally induces more extensive weight change than LoRA measured by the Frobenius norm of weight updates for both approaches (Fig. 3e).\n\nNeural network sparsification with FIP algorithm\n\nThe critical aspects of the FIP framework are that the framework generalizes and addresses a broad range of machine learning meta-problems by considering a more general set of secondary objective functions. In particular, we next apply the FIP framework to perform sparsification, reducing the number of non-zero weights, which is important for reducing the memory and computational footprint of a network35. To sparsify neural networks, we solve equation (4), the core FIP optimization problem, with a secondary loss function L(wt, w, p) that measures the Euclidean distance between a network and its p-sparse projection obtained by setting p% of the networks’ weights to zero (Fig. 4a).\n\nUsing the framework, we sparsified the vision transformer DeIT, which has been used for benchmarking sparsification methods36 on vision transformers. The paradigm uses the ImageNet 1,000-object image classification task (ImageNet1K dataset), and attempts to sparsify DeIT. DeIT-Base (DeIT-B) is an 86M parameter transformer model that was derived from ViT37. We use the FIP algorithm to set the weight parameters to zero without loss of performance on the ImageNet1K classification task. The simplicity of the FIP algorithm allowed us to achieve an entire range of target sparsities ranging from 0% to 80%. We found that FIP had performance very near to that of the SViT network at the benchmark of 40% sparsity, with FIP performing at 80.22% and SViT performing at 81.56% accuracy (Fig. 4b(i)), with compute times given (Fig. 4b(ii)) on an NVIDIA RTX3090 24 GB. Additionally, we applied FIP to perform the sparsificaiton of CNN architectures (Supplementary Fig. 3) for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) and CIFAR tasks, showing that the FIP can also achieve high sparsification values and maintain accuracy in the ResNet and LeNet CNN architectures (Supplementary Fig. 3).\n\nThen, we applied FIP to sparsify the BERT base from 0% to 80% sparsity for all the general language understanding evaluation (GLUE) NLP tasks. For this task, we obtained an NVIDIA A100 machine from PaperSpace. The GLUE benchmark consists of three categories of natural language understanding tasks: (1) single-sentence tasks (corpus of linguistic acceptability (CoLA) and Stanford sentiment (SST-2)), (2) similarity and paraphrase tasks (Microsoft research paraphrase corpus (MRPC), Quora question pairs (QQPs) and Semantic Text Similarity Benchmark (STS-B)) and (3) inference tasks (multi-genre natural language inference (MNLI), question-answering natural language inference (QNLI) and recognizing textual entailment (RTE)). Again, because of its ease of use and efficiency, we were able to span the entire range of sparsities identifying differential performance across GLUE tasks (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 4). FIP was able to generate sparse versions of BERT that had 81.65% accuracy at 50% sparsity on the SST-2 task. We provide compute times in seconds for the sparsification of BERT on MRPC, which efficiently runs on an NVIDIA A100 machine (Fig. 4d).\n\nFIP ensemble confers robustness against adversarial attack\n\nThe path-connected sets of networks generated by the FIP can also be applied to perform inference and increase the robustness of inference tasks to data perturbation. Although deep CNNs have achieved remarkable performance on image recognition tasks, human-imperceptible additive perturbations, known as adversarial attacks, can be applied to an input image and induce catastrophic errors in deep neural networks (Fig. 5b). The FIP algorithm provides an efficient strategy to increase network robustness and mitigate adversarial failure by generating path-connected sets of networks with diverse weights. We then apply the path-connected network sets to perform robust image classification by averaging their output.\n\nTo demonstrate that the FIP algorithm can mitigate adversarial attacks, we trained a 16-layered CNN—VGG16—with 130M parameters to classify CIFAR-10 images with 92% test accuracy. We, then, generated adversarial test images using the projected gradient descent (PGD) attack strategy. On adversarial test images, the performance of VGG16 dropped to 37% (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 1). To mitigate the adversarial performance loss, we applied the FIP algorithm to generate an ensemble of functionally invariant networks by setting L = 0 in the optimization problem in equation (4) and setting \\({\\langle \\frac{{\\rm{d}}\\gamma }{{\\rm{d}}t},\\frac{{\\rm{d}}\\gamma }{{\\rm{d}}t}\\rangle }_{{{\\bf{g}}}_{{\\rm{CIFAR}}10}}\\) to be the distance moved in the networks’ output space for CIFAR-10 images. We use the FIP ensemble to classify images by summing the ‘softmaxed’ outputs of the ensemble.\n\nUsing an ensemble of ten networks sampled along an FIP, we achieve an accuracy of 55.61 ± 1.1%, surpassing the performance of the DeepNet ensemble (composed of 10 independently trained deep networks) by 20.62% (Fig. 5c). The FIP ensemble’s adversarial performance also surpasses other state-of-the-art ensemble approaches including adaptive diversity-promoting (43.84 ± 7.8%) ensemble and the fast geometric ensembling (41.7 ± 0.34) method. The two factors contributing to the FIP ensemble’s robustness are (1) high intra-ensemble weight diversity, calculated by the representation diversity score; and (2) low coherence with a trained surrogate network (used to generate adversarial images) (Fig. 5e,f). FIP networks have a higher representation diversity score in their early processing layers, from layer 1 to layer 6, compared with the DeepNet ensemble, indicating that individual networks in the FIP ensemble extract different sets of local features from the adversarial image, preventing networks from relying on similar spurious correlations for image classification. We speculate that weight/parameter diversity in the FIP ensemble leads to differential susceptibility to adversarial examples but consistent performance on training and test examples. The approach has analogies with the model soup approaches explored in ref. 38.\n\nGenerating path-connected sets of language models\n\nConceptually, the most important aspect of the FIP framework is that it unifies a series of machine learning meta-tasks (CL and sparsification) into a single mathematical framework. Mathematically, when we solve equation (4) with a given secondary loss function, we move an existing network w(0) along a path in weight space generating a new network w(t) in which the parameter t increments the length of a path. Each additional loss function generates a new transformation of a base network, for example, generating a network adjusted to accommodate an additional data analysis problem or a secondary objective like sparsification. Network transformation maps can be iterated and applied to generate a family of neural networks optimized for distinct subtasks. The resulting path-connected set of neural networks can then be queried for networks that achieve specific user goals or solve additional machine learning problems.\n\nThe problem of customization is particularly important for transformer networks4,39,40,41. Transformers like BERT and Roberta are typically trained on generic text corpus like the common crawl, and the specialization of networks on specific domains is a major goal3,32. We applied the iterative FIP framework to generate a large number of NLP networks customized for different subtasks and sparsification goals. Transformer networks incorporate layers of attention heads that provide contextual weight for positions in a sentence. Transformer networks are often trained on a generic language processing task like sentence completion in which the network must infer missing or masked words in a sentence. Models are then fine-tuned for specific problems including sentiment analysis, question answering, text generation and general language understanding39. Transformer networks are large containing hundreds of millions of weights, and therefore, model customization can be computationally intensive.\n\nWe applied the FIP framework to perform a series of model customization tasks through the iterative application of FIP transformations on distinct goals. The BERT network has a total of 12 layers, or transformer blocks, with 12 self-attention heads in each layer and a total of 110M parameters5. Using the FIP framework, we sequentially applied two operations (CL and compression (Co)) to BERT models trained on a range of language tasks, by constructing FIPs in the BERT weight space using different objective functions (L(x, w)) and solving the optimization problem in equation (4) (Fig. 6).\n\nWe demonstrated that we could apply the CL and Co operations in sequence. Beginning with the BERT base model, we applied the FIP model to generate networks that could perform Yelp and IMDb sentiment analysis, and then compressed the resulting networks to generate six distinct networks with sparsity ranging from 10% to 60%, where all the sparsified networks maintained performance on the sentiment analysis tasks (Fig. 6a). We, then, performed the same operations, but changed the order of operations (Fig. 6b). The models generated through the application of CLCo(w) and CoCL(w) achieved similar functional performance in terms of sparsification and task performance but had distinct weight configurations.\n\nIn total, we used the FIP framework to generate networks using a set of different natural language tasks and Co tasks, yielding a path-connected set of 300 BERT models (Fig. 6c). The 300 networks define a submanifold of weight space that contains models customized for distinct subtasks. Then, the submanifold provides a computational resource for solving new problems. We can query the resulting FIP submanifold with unseen data by using perplexity as a measure of a networks intrinsic ability to separate an unseen dataset. Using perplexity, we queried the FIP submanifold of BERT networks with IMDb data and WikiText data. We found that the distinct language datasets achieve minimal perplexity on different classes of networks. WikiText obtains optimal performance on CoCL networks and IMDb achieves optimal performance on CLCo networks. These results demonstrate that the FIP framework can generate diverse sets of neural networks by transforming networks using distinct meta-tasks. The submanifolds of weight space can then be inexpensively queried to identify networks pre-optimized for new machine learning problems.\n\nThe major contribution of our framework is that it provides a unified theoretical and mathematical framework through which a set of problems can be addressed across a variety of neural network architectures. To the best of our knowledge, no single mathematical framework has been applied to address the set of machine learning meta-problems and diversity of neural network architectures that we address with the FIP framework. Further, with the rise of transformer models, we have seen the emergence of architecture-specific strategies for sparsification and CL. We provide a unified framework that can achieve a similar quality of results across different classes of architectures (CNN and transformers) and across different transformer variants. Although representation learning frameworks have been pursued in fields including reinforced learning42,43, our work develops a geometric framework that identifies invariant subspaces within the parameter space for distinct auxiliary tasks. We demonstrate that the framework scales to transformer models with hundreds of millions of parameters. Therefore, our framework provides a unified theoretical and mathematical model for connecting the geometry of parameter space with different model subtasks as well as practically scaling to provide results in line with the state-of-the-art, more specific approaches. The FIP is also related to Jacobian regularization approaches that have been explored to stabilize model training and prevent over-fitting44. Here we review some of the specific approaches that have been studied for CL, sparsification and adversarial robustness.\n\nCL and catastrophic forgetting\n\nCL has been studied extensively in the machine learning literature45,46,47 for classical CNN as well as vision and language transformers48,49. A wide variety of approaches have been developed to train neural networks on a sequence of tasks without the loss of prior task performance including regularization-based methods, weight parameter isolation methods and replay-based methods. Many classic CL/catastrophic forgetting (CF) approaches were developed for CNN architectures with <100M parameters. With the emergence of transformer models for NLP and computer vision, approaches have become more model specific with approaches such as regularization-based methods and parameter isolation methods. Regularization-based methods assign constraints to prevent parameter changes to important parameters from prior tasks. The FIP framework can be viewed as a generalized regularization framework that applies at any point in the parameter space. Methods like EWC33, OGD50, RMN30 and synaptic intelligence51 penalize the movement of parameters that are important for solving previous tasks to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. RMN identifies the relevant units in the pre-trained model that are most important for the new task using a thresholding strategy. OGD constrains movement in the parameter space to move in a subspace that is orthogonal to gradients from prior tasks. OGD was applied to CL tasks on the MNIST data50 on a small, three-layer multi-layer perceptron. The OGD method requires knowledge of prior task gradients and is a local method, like EWC. Although (locally in the parameter space) it makes sense to constrain changes in the network parameters along the orthogonal subspace, there is no mathematical reason that long-range updates should satisfy this constraint. Past gradient directions become less meaningful as we move away from an initial trained network and begin traversing long-range paths in the parameter space in search of good networks. By using a metric tensor construction that is defined at every point in the parameter space, the FIP framework can traverse long-range paths in the parameter space, sometimes making weight updates that are, in fact, not orthogonal to gradients.\n\nReplay-based methods store and replay past data or apply generative models to replay data during training to mitigate catastrophic forgetting52,53. Regularization-based methods including EWC constrain the learning of important parameters from previous tasks by assigning constraints to prevent parameter changes. Architecture expansion or dynamic architecture methods like progressive neural networks54, dynamically expandable networks55 and super-masks in position56 adapt, grow or mask the model’s architecture, respectively, allowing specialization without interfering with previous knowledge. Parameter isolation methods: these methods isolate specific parameters or subsets of parameters to be task specific, preventing interference with previous knowledge. Examples include the context-dependent gating approach or the learning-without-forgetting method. Instead of modifying the learning objective or replaying data, various methods use different model components for different tasks. In progressive neural networks, dynamically expandable networks and reinforced CL (RCL) the model is expanded for each new task.\n\nLow-rank fine tuning with LoRA\n\nLoRA32 was designed to enable the computationally efficient adaptation of large transformer models by forcing weight updates to be low ranked. LoRA achieves impressive performance on the fine tuning of very large models including GPT-3 (175B). LoRA achieves its performance by introducing a low-rank structure heuristic into the weight update through matrix factorization, forcing ΔW = AB, where A and B have an inner dimension r, and thus controlling the rank of W to be r. We view FIP and LoRA as complementary methods and seek to incorporate low-rank constraints into new versions of the FIP algorithm.\n\nSparsification methods\n\nSparsity methods for neural networks aim to reduce the number of parameters or activations in a network, thereby improving efficiency and reducing memory requirements. Unstructured pruning techniques apply strategies based on network weights or weight gradients to remove weights that do not contribute to network performance. Unstructured sparsity methods seek to remove weights at any position in the network. The lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH) demonstrated that dense networks often contain sparse subnetworks, named winning tickets, that can achieve high accuracy when isolated from the dense network57. LTH methods discover these sparse networks through an empirical pruning procedure. Unstructured pruning methods remove inconsequential weight elements using criteria including weight magnitude, gradient and Hessian47,58,59. Recent strategies60,61 dynamically extract and train sparse subnetworks instead of training the full models. Evolutionary strategies including the sparse evolutionary training procedure62,63 begin with sparse topologies (for example, Erdős–Rényi generated graphs) in training and optimize topology and network weights during training. Historically, sparsity methods have been applied to convolutional and multi-layer perceptron architectures. Recent frameworks have been introduced for the sparsification of transformer architectures. For example, a vision transformer sparsification strategy SViTE36 was developed that uses model training integrated with prune/grow strategies, achieving the sparsification of the ViT family of transformers. The sparsification of BERT64 was explored by identifying specific internal network topology that can achieve high performance on NLP tasks with sparse weight distribution through empirical investigation and ablation experiments.\n\nRobustness to adversarial attack\n\nFinally, we demonstrate that the FIP can generate ensembles of networks with good performance in adversarial attack paradigms. Like CL and sparsificaiton, adversarial attack mitigation has been addressed by a wide range of methods including augmented training with adversarial examples65, through the use of diversified network ensembles66, as well as through re-coding of the input67. We demonstrate that the FIP framework can generate network ensembles that have intrinsic resistance to adversarial attack compared with base networks.\n\nIn the main text, we have introduced a geometric framework to solve three core challenges in modern machine learning, namely, (1) alleviating catastrophic forgetting, (2) network sparsification and (3) increasing robustness against adversarial attacks. We will describe the datasets, parameters/hyperparameters used for the algorithms and the pseudo-code for each of the core challenges addressed in the main text.\n\nCatastrophic forgetting\n\nDatasets and preprocessing\n\nThe models were tested on two paradigms:\n\nSplitCIFAR100: ten sequential-task paradigm, where the model is exposed to ten tasks, sampled from the CIFAR-100 dataset. The CIFAR-100 dataset contains 50,000 RGB images for 100 classes of real-life objects in the training set, and 10,000 images in the testing set. Each task requires the network to identify images from ten non-overlapping CIFAR-100 classes.\n\nWe performed two operations, namely, (1) network Co and (2) CL on BERT, fine-tuned on different language datasets, downloaded from the HF website.\n\nWikipedia: the Wikipedia English datasets are downloaded from https://huggingface.co/datasets/wikipedia. We used the Wikipedia dataset on the masked language model (MLM) task.\n\nYelp reviews: the Yelp review dataset is obtained from HF, downloaded from https://huggingface.co/datasets/yelp_review_full.\n\nIMDb reviews: the IMDb review dataset is obtained from HF, downloaded from https://huggingface.co/datasets/imdb.\n\nGLUE dataset: the GLUE dataset is obtained from HF, downloaded from https://huggingface.co/datasets/glue. The GLUE tasks performed in this paper are (1) QQPs, (2) SST-2, (3) CoLA, (4) RTE, (5) MNLI, (6) MRPC and (7) QNLI.\n\nParameters used\n\nFIP for CL: η = 2 × 10–5, λ = 1, n memories from previous task = 2,000/650,000 = (0.8% previous dataset); optimizer used, AdamW.\n\nFIP for BERT sparsification: η = 2 × 10–5, λ = 1; optimizer used, AdamW. Final (desired) network sparsities for the GLUE task: task (p% sparse): RTE (60% sparse), CoLA (50% sparse), STS-B (50% sparse), QNLI (70% sparse), SST-2 (60% sparse), MNLI (70% sparse), QQP (90% sparse) and MRPC (50% sparse). Final (desired) network sparsities for Wikipedia sentence completion: [10%, 20%…90%].\n\nNetwork architectures\n\nAll state-of-art methods for alleviating CF (presented in the main text) in the two-task and five-task paradigm used the same network architectures: the ViT-Base and ViT-Huge transformer variants described at https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/vit. BERT is a popular transformer model with 12 layers (transformer blocks), each with a hidden size of 768, 12 self-attention heads in each layer with a total of 110M parameters (https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/bert). BERT has been pre-trained on 45 GB of Wikipedia data, using the MLM task and next-sentence prediction.\n\nSentence completion (masking) tasks\n\nFor the masking tasks (where 15% of the words in the input sentence are masked (or blanked)), the BERT network has an MLM head appended to the network. The MLM head produces a three-dimensional tensor as the output, where the dimensions correspond to (1) the number of sentences in a single batch (batch-size), (2) number of blanked-out words in a sentence and (3) number of tokens in the BERT vocabulary (30,000 tokens).\n\nSentence classification tasks\n\nFor the sentence classification task, a sentence classifier head was appended to the BERT architecture. Here the classifier head produces a two-dimensional output tensor, where the dimensions correspond to (1) batch-size and (2) number of unique classes in the classification problem.\n\nPseudo-code: FIP construction for CF problems\n\nAlgorithm 1\n\nFIP construction for CF problems:\n\nRequire λ; η, step-size hyperparameters; NT, number of sequential tasks\n\n1: procedure FIP-CF(λ, η, NT)\n\n2: random initialize w0\n\n3: Bi←{}∀i = 1, 2…NT ⊳ buffer with nmem memories from previous tasks\n\n4: 1 for i←1 to NT do\n\n5: wi←wi−1\n\n6: (x, t)←Task i ⊳ minibatch of images (x) and target labels (t) from task i\n\n7: Bi←Bi ∪ x ⊳ update buffer\n\n8: CEloss←Cross-Entropy(f(x, wi), t) ⊳ classification loss for new task\n\n9: Yloss←0\n\n10: for j←1 to i – 1 do\n\n11: Yloss += Ydist(f(x, wi), f(Bj, wi−1)) ⊳ distance moved in output space (Y)\n\n12: end for\n\n13: S←CEloss + λ × Yloss ⊳ construct FIP with direction from loss gradient\n\n14: \\({{\\bf{w}}}_{{\\bf{i}}}\\leftarrow {{\\bf{w}}}_{{\\bf{i}}}-\\eta {\\nabla }_{{{\\bf{w}}}_{{\\bf{i}}}}S\\)\n\n15: end for\n\n16: return wi\n\n17: end procedure\n\nCode specifications\n\nAll the code was written in the PyTorch framework, and the automatic differentiation package was extensively used for constructing the computational graphs and computing gradients for updating the network parameters. The code for constructing the FIPs for the 2-task and 20-task paradigm was run on Caltech’s high-performance computing cluster using a single GPU for a total time of 1 h and 10 h, respectively.\n\nParameters used\n\nThe parameters used for the current state-of-art methods across different models and datasets have been selected after grid search to maximize accuracy.\n\nFIP for 2-task paradigm: η = 0.01; optimizer used, Adam; weight-decay = 2 × 10–4, λ = 1, n memories from previous task = 500/60,000 (0.8% of the previous dataset).\n\nEWC for 2-task paradigm: optimizer used, Adam; EWC regularization coefficient (λ) = 5,000, learning rate = 0.001, batch-size = 128, number of data samples from previous task to construct the Fisher metric = 500.\n\nFIP for 20-task paradigm: η = 0.01; optimizer used, Adam; weight-decay = 2 × 10–4, λ = 1, n memories from previous task = 250/2,500 (10% of the previous tasks).\n\nGEM for 20-task paradigm: n memories from previous task = 250, learning rate = 0.01, number of epochs (per task) = 20, memory strength = 0.5, batch-size = 128.\n\nEWC for 20-task paradigm: optimizer used, Adam; EWC++, α = 0.9, λ = 5,000, learning rate = 0.001, Fisher metric update after 50 training iterations and batch-size = 128.\n\nImplementation of other CF methods\n\nWe implemented the EWC method by adapting the code available at https://github.com/moskomule/ewc.pytorch. The GEM method was applied by adapting the code available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/GradientEpisodicMemory.\n\nLoRA: LoRA training for the model was done using the PEFT library71. We instantiate the base language model (for example, model trained on the Yelp dataset). We create a LoRAConfig object, where we can specify the following parameters: LoRA rank (ranks of 1, 4, 8, 16, 32), LoRA α (scaling factor): (usually we use α = rank × 2). Target modules: ‘query’ and ‘value’ in the attention layer (across all the layers of the network) and LoRA dropout = 0.1. In the LoRA experiments, we explored a variety of different learning rates to stabilize training including 10−6→10−5. For ViT experiments, we use a ramping procedure with a learning rate that starts at 1 × 10–3 until it reaches the maximum peak at 1 and then decreases.\n\nExample parameter settings for LoRA on NLP for BERT are as follows.\n\nLoRA training with rank = 16, α = 32; learning rate = 3 × 10–5\n\nLoRA training with rank = 16, α = 32; learning rate = 1 × 10–5\n\nLoRA training with rank = 16, α = 32; each step corresponds to 400 samples at learning rate = 1 × 10–5\n\nLoRA training with rank = 16, α = 32; each step corresponds to 1,600 samples at learning rate = 1 × 10–5\n\nLoRA training with rank = 16, α = 32; each step corresponds to 1,600 samples at learning rate = 2 × 10–6 (initial training steps)\n\nPost-convergence: LoRA training with rank = 4, α = 8; each step corresponds to 1,600 samples at learning rate = 2 × 10–6\n\nNetwork sparsification\n\nDatasets and preprocessing\n\nThe models were sparsified using a well-known image dataset, ImageNet1K (https://huggingface.co/datasets/imagenet-1k), which contains 1,000 object classes and contains 1,281,167 training images, 50,000 validation images and 100,000 test images.\n\nNetwork architectures\n\nWe used the DeIT vision transformer from Meta for demonstrating the strategy for constructing FIP in weight space. The network and variants are described at https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/deit. As described, the base DeIT (86M parameters) achieves top-1 accuracy of 83.1% (single-crop evaluation) on ImageNet with no external data.\n\nWe also used the BERT dataset available at https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/bert.\n\nPseudo-code: FIP construction for network sparsification\n\nAlgorithm 2\n\nFIP construction for network sparsification:\n\nRequire: λ, η\n\nRequire: p, final desired network sparsity (in percentage)\n\nRequire: wt, network trained on MNIST or CIFAR-10 dataset\n\n1: procedure FIP-Sparse(λ, η, p, wt)\n\n2: w←wt\n\n3: while (∣∣w∣∣0/∣∣wt∣∣0) NOT (1 − p/100) ⊳ until w not in p% sparse submanifold\n\n4: wp←project(w, p) ⊳ set p% of smallest weights to zero\n\n5: L(w)←∣∣w − wp∣∣2\n\n6: x←dataset(MNIST or CIFAR) ⊳ sample minibatch of images from the dataset\n\n7: OPloss←odist(f(x, w), f(x, wt)) ⊳ distance moved in the output space\n\n8: S←OPloss + λ × L(w)\n\n9: w←w − η∇wS ⊳ constructing FIP towards sparse submanifold\n\n10: end while\n\n11: return w\n\n12: end procedure\n\nCode specifications\n\nAll the code was written in the PyTorch framework, and the automatic differentiation package was extensively used for constructing the computational graphs and computing gradients for updating the network parameters. The code for constructing the FIPs to the p% sparse submanifolds was run on Caltech’s high-performance computing cluster using a single GPU for a total time ranging between 2 h and 6 h for final network sparsities below 80%, and between 24 h and 30 h for identifying high-performance networks in submanifolds with larger than 80% sparsity.\n\nParameters used\n\nFIP for network sparsification: λ = 1, η = 0.01; optimizer used, Adam (β = (0.9, 0.999)); final (desired) network sparsities for LeNet-300-100 on MNIST: p = [20%, 67%, 89%, 96%, 98.7%, 99%, 99.1%, 99.4%]; final (desired) network sparsities for ResNet20 on CIFAR-10: p = [20%, 36%, 49%, 59%, 67%, 79%, 83%, 89%, 93%, 95%].\n\nLTH (for LeNet-MNIST): batch-size = 128, model-init = kaiming-normal, batchnorm-init = uniform, pruning-strategy = sparse-global, pruning-fraction = 0.2, pruning-layers-to-ignore = fc.weight, optimizer-name = sgd, learning rate = 0.1, training-steps = 40 epochs. LTH (for ResNet20-CIFAR-10): batch-size = 128, model-init = kaiming-normal, batchnorm-init = uniform, pruning-strategy = sparse-global, pruning-fraction = 0.2, optimizer-name = sgd, learning rate = 0.1, training-steps = 160 epochs, momentum = 0.9, gamma = 0.1, weight-decay ≥ 0.0001.\n\nImplementation of other sparsification methods\n\nWe implemented the LTH for sparsifying both LeNet-300-100 trained on MNIST and ResNet20 trained on CIFAR-10. To do so, we adapted code from https://github.com/facebookresearch/open_lth.\n\nAdversarial robustness\n\nDatasets and preprocessing\n\nThe models were trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset and the adversarial examples were generated on the same using the PGD method.\n\nCIFAR-10: the CIFAR-10 training dataset contains 50,000 RGB images of 10 classes of natural images (like trucks, horses, birds and ships). The test set contains 10,000 additional images from each of the 10 classes.\n\nNetwork architecture\n\nFor the adversarial robustness section, we used the VGG16 network72, which has 16 layers, and a total of 138M trainable parameters.\n\nGenerating an adversarial attack\n\nWe used the PGD method to generate CIFAR-10 data samples that are imperceptibly similar to their original images for humans, but cause performance loss to deep networks. The PGD attack computes the best direction (in image space) to perturb the image such that it maximizes the trained networks’ loss on the image and constraining the Linf norm of the perturbation.\n\nThe procedure for generating adversarial inputs is detailed below:\n\nRandomly initialize a VGG16 network and train it on CIFAR-10 (trained network = wt).\n\nTake a single image input (x) from the CIFAR-10 dataset and pass it through the trained network, and calculate the gradient of the classification loss (cross-entropy (C)) with respect to the input (grad = ∇xC(wt, x, y)).\n\nConstruct an adversarial input (x′) by taking multiple steps (S) in the image input space, where the adversary is within an ϵl∞ bound. xt+1 = ∏x+S(xt + αsgn(∇xC(wt, x, y))). Here we take as many steps (S) as required until the adversarial input (xt+1) exits the ϵl∞ bound. We choose ϵ = 0.3 and α = 2/255 for generating CIFAR-10 adversarial examples against VGG16 networks.\n\nRepresentation diversity score\n\nWe compute the representation diversity score for both ensembles (FIP and DeepNet) by evaluating the standard deviation of the L2 norm of the network’s activation across all the networks in the ensemble along each layer for a set of image inputs.\n\nCoherence between two models\n\nWe compute the overlap of the adversarial subspace between networks in the FIP ensemble and the trained surrogate network by evaluating the cosine distance between the gradients of the loss function of the FIP networks and the trained surrogate network with respect to an input (x).\n\nSay, the gradients of the loss function with respect to input (x) for the two models are Jx(θ0, x, y) and Jx(θ1, x, y). The cosine distance between the gradients is evaluated as follows, where CS indicates cosine similarity.\n\n$${\\mathrm{CS}}({\\nabla}_{x}\\;{J}_{0},{\\nabla}_{x}\\;{J}_{1})\\left.\\right)=\\frac{ < {\\nabla}_{x}\\;{J}_{0},{\\nabla}_{x}\\;{J}_{1} > }{| {\\nabla}_{x}\\;{J}_{0}| | {\\nabla}_{x}\\;{J}_{1}| }.$$\n\n(6)\n\nThe cosine distance between the gradients provides a quantitative measure for how likely an adversarial input that affects the surrogate network would attack the model sampled along an FIP.\n\nTo evaluate the coherence across all the sampled models in the FIP and a trained surrogate network, we measure the maximum cosine similarity between all pairs of gradient vectors in the set.\n\n$${\\max }_{a\\in 1\\ldots N}{\\mathrm{CS}}({\\nabla}_{x}\\;{J}_{a},{\\nabla}_{x}\\;{J}_{\\rm{s}})\\left.\\right).$$\n\n(7)\n\nHere Ja refers to the gradient of N networks sampled along the FIP for a single input (x), and Js refers to the gradient of the trained surrogate network for the input (x).\n\nPseudo-code: FIP for adversarial robust ensembles\n\nAlgorithm 3\n\nFIP for adversarially robust ensembles\n\nRequire: η, step size; wt, network trained on CIFAR-10 dataset; ϵl∞ of adversary perturbation\n\nRequire: δ, permissible change in output distance; max-iter, number of steps in the FIP\n\n1: procedure FIP-ensemble(η, wt, δ, ϵ)\n\n2: w←wt\n\n3: ii←0 ⊳ setting counter = 0\n\n4: F←{} ⊳ list of networks in the FIP ensemble\n\n5: while ii ≤ max-iter\n\n6: (x, y)←dataset(CIFAR-10) ⊳ sample minibatch of images from dataset\n\n7: S←odist(f(x, w), f(x, wt)) ⊳ output-space distance for varying network weights\n\n8: w←w − η∇wS ⊳ construct undirected FIP\n\n9: x′←x + εsgn(∇xC(w, x, y))\n\n10: H←odist(f(x, w), f(x′, w)) ⊳ output-space distance for perturbed input\n\n11: if H ≤ δ then\n\n12: F←F ∪ w\n\n13: end if\n\n14: ii←ii + 1\n\n15: end while\n\n16: return F ⊳ returning FIP ensemble with adversarial robustness\n\n17: end procedure\n\nCode specifications\n\nAll the code was written in the PyTorch framework, and the automatic differentiation package was extensively used for constructing the computational graphs and computing gradients for updating the network parameters.

The third method called fast geometric ensembling is obtained by adapting the code taken from this repository: https://github.com/timgaripov/dnn-mode-connectivity.\n\nFIP for multiple ‘operations’ on BERT language model\n\nWe scale our FIP geometric framework to perform multiple operations (like CL and Co) on BERT language models that are very large and are capable of parsing large amounts of text scraped from different internet sources (like, Wikipedia, Yelp, IMDb and so on).\n\nDatasets and preprocessing\n\nWe performed two operations, namely, (1) network Co and (2) CL on BERT, fine tuned on different language datasets, downloaded from the HF website.\n\nWikipedia: the Wikipedia English datasets are downloaded from https://huggingface.co/datasets/wikipedia. We used the Wikipedia dataset on the MLM task.\n\nYelp reviews: the Yelp review datasets are obtained from HF, downloaded from https://huggingface.co/datasets/yelp_review_fullhttps://huggingface.co/datasets/yelp_review_full.\n\nIMDb reviews: the IMDb review datasets are obtained from HF, downloaded from https://huggingface.co/datasets/imdb.\n\nGLUE dataset: the GLUE dataset is obtained from HF, downloaded from https://huggingface.co/datasets/gluehttps://huggingface.co/datasets/glue. The GLUE tasks performed in this paper are (1) QQPs, (2) SST-2, (3) CoLA, (4) RTE, (5) MNLI, (6) MRPC and (7) QNLI.\n\nNetwork architecture\n\nBERT is a popular transformer model having 12 layers (transformer blocks), each with a hidden size of 768, comprising 12 self-attention heads in each layer having a total of 110M parameters5. BERT has been pre-trained on 45 GB of Wikipedia data, using the MLM task, and next-sentence prediction.\n\nSentence completion (masking) tasks\n\nFor the masking tasks (where 15% of the words in the input sentence are masked (or blanked)), the BERT network has an MLM head appended to the network. The MLM head produces a three-dimensional tensor as the output, where the dimensions correspond to (1) the number of sentences in a single batch (batch-size), (2) number of blanked-out words in a sentence and (3) number of tokens in the BERT vocabulary (30,000 tokens).\n\nSentence classification tasks\n\nFor the sentence classification task, a sentence classifier head was appended to the BERT architecture. Here the classifier head produces a two-dimensional output tensor, where the dimensions correspond to (1) batch-size and (2) number of unique classes in the classification problem.\n\nCode specifications\n\nAll the code was written in the PyTorch framework, and the automatic differentiation package was extensively used for constructing the computational graphs and computing gradients for updating the network parameters. The code for constructing the FIPs in the BERT weight space for CL on Yelp and IMDb sentiment analysis and for BERT sparsification was run on Caltech’s high-performance computing cluster using two GPUs for a total time of 2 h and 6–30 h, respectively.\n\nParameters used\n\nFIP for CL: η = 2 × 10–5, λ = 1, n memories from previous task = 2,000/650,000 (0.8% of the previous dataset). Optimizer used, AdamW.\n\nFIP for BERT sparsification: η = 2 × 10–5, λ = 1. Optimizer used, AdamW. Final (desired) network sparsities for the GLUE task: task (p% sparse): RTE (60% sparse), CoLA (50% sparse), STS-B (50% sparse), QNLI (70% sparse), SST-2 (60% sparse), MNLI (70% sparse), QQP (90% sparse), MRPC (50% sparse). Final (desired) network sparsities for Wikipedia sentence completion: [10%, 20%…90%].\n\nFIP length\n\nThe FIP length is evaluated by sampling a large number of networks along the FIP, and summing the Euclidean distance between all the consecutive pairs of networks. Say, the weights of the networks sampled along the FIP are denoted by w1, w2, w3…wn.\n\n$$\\,\\text{FIP-length}\\,=\\mathop{\\Sigma }\\limits_{i = 2}^{n}| | {{\\bf{w}}}_{{\\bf{i}}}-{{\\bf{w}}}_{{\\bf{i}}-{\\bf{1}}}| {| }_{2}$$\n\nPerplexity score: language models\n\nPerplexity is an evaluation metric used to measure how ‘surprised’ a language model is when it encounters a new task. That is, a higher perplexity implies more surprise, suggesting that the language model does not have much insight into how language works. Mathematically, we define perplexity as the exponential of the cross-entropy loss on the evaluation dataset:\n\n$$\\,\\text{PPL}\\,(\\theta )=\\exp \\left[\\mathop{\\Sigma }\\limits_{i = 1}^{{n}_{e}}l(\\theta ,{x}_{i})\\right],$$\n\nwhere θ is the parameter of the BERT model and x1, x2…\\({x}_{{n}_{\\rm{e}}}\\) are the ne inputs from the evaluation dataset. l(θ, xi) evaluates the cross-entropy loss of a BERT model parameterized by θ for a single input xi.\n\nConstructing FIP ensemble for adversarial robustness\n\nSelection criteria for FIP ensemble\n\nHaving constructed an FIP in the weight space, beginning from a deep network trained on CIFAR-10, we introduce the selection criteria to sample diverse networks along the FIP to construct the FIP ensemble. As we want the FIP ensemble to be robust to adversarial input perturbation, we generate random perturbations in the image space (within an ϵl∞ ball) and compute the distance moved in the networks’ output space for a small perturbation in the image space.\n\nWe record the distance moved in the networks’ output space (across all the networks in the constructed FIP) and plot a distribution of the distance moved in the output space for a small perturbation in the image input space. We find that some networks along the FIP exhibit smaller perturbation in the output space and have a narrower distribution across 10k perturbed training inputs, whereas others exhibit larger perturbation in the output space. We choose networks that exhibit a smaller perturbation in the output space for constructing the FIP ensemble.",
