Generally chunking is what causes the most information because it breaks the flow of everything. \n\nDepending on the source, I like to clean the data as much as possible. and extract the important stuff.  Or break it down by sections and topics, so those chunks are closer together.  I store the important topics and questions into json to create a library of information about everything.  Then if you want to go a step further and specialized knowledge is important.  then a graph representation usually helps (graph rag)\n\nAt the core, it is about language compression and ideas.

      "# [Comparison: RAG vs. Long Context Window models by Guruprasad Raghavan](https://www.yurts.ai/blog/rag-systems-vs-lcw-performance-and-cost-trade-offs)\nHighlights\n\nDiscover the performance and cost trade-offs between Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems and Large Context Window (LCW) models.\n\nBiographies benchmark: RAG systems outperform LCW models in retrieving needles from haystacks up to 2M tokens\n\nMulti-needle retrieval: Yurts RAG system excels at finding multiple needles regardless of their position in the haystack\n\nCompute requirements: RAG systems are significantly more cost-effective, requiring fewer GPU resources compared to LCW models\n\n‍\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) with extremely long context windows (LCW) have become a focal point of discussion, particularly for enterprise adoption of GenAI [1,2,3,4]. Long context window LLMs such as Gemini, GPT-4o, Llama-1-405B, and Mixtral have further fueled this interest.\n\nWith the emergence of LCW models, came the development of academic benchmarks to quantify the effectiveness of these large systems. The popular benchmarks designed for LCW evaluation are as follows:\n\nNeedle in a Haystack (and its variants) [5,6]\n\nInfinity Bench [7]\n\nZeroSCROLLS [8]\n\nIn this article, we conduct a comparative analysis between LCW models, utilizing in-context learning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems paired with smaller context window models. This comparison spans both ends of the AI architectural size spectrum and is applied to two variants of the Needle in a Haystack (NIAH) benchmark.\n\nOur major contributions in this study are twofold:\n\nWe demonstrate that RAG systems paired with small context window models are more performant and cost effective than Long context window (LCW) models for use-cases that involve retrieval and analysis of specific information from a very large corpus of documents.\n\nAcademic benchmarks (like Needle in a haystack) aren't well suited for demonstrating the unique abilities of LCW models in Enterprise AI scenarios. This necessitates the push to develop better benchmarks that can uniquely highlight abilities of LCW models that aren’t available in smaller systems. Additionally, the NIAH assays are not in touch with the reality of enterprise information as most haystacks are not neatly formatted text, but are instead trapped within documents like pdfs, ppts, and other document formats.\n\nWhat is the Needle in a Haystack benchmark?\n\nNeedle in a Haystack benchmark, as the name suggests, is a synthetic document wherein a “needle” (i.e. a relevant piece of information) is hidden with a large “Haystack” (i.e. large corpus of text); And models (or systems of models) are evaluated with a query that aims to retrieve that particular needle.\n\nThe NIAH benchmark is highly relevant for Enterprise AI use cases that involve accessing and analyzing specific pieces of information from a large corpus of text and documents within enterprises.\n\nWe evaluate the two systems (RAG and LCW models) on two variants of the needle-in-a-haystack benchmark, namely:\n\nBiographies (NIAH) benchmark: Here, a single needle (that is very closely related in content to the haystack) is inserted into the haystack at an arbitrary position. Using a testset of 140 biographical questions for every haystack size, we compare and contrast different systems, using haystacks ranging from 2k to 2M tokens. The accuracy scores reported (for every haystack size) corresponds to the number of biographical questions that the model (or system of models) got perfectly right for every distinct haystack size. (We provide this dataset on hugging face for easy access: Biographies-HF)\n\nMulti-needle in a haystack: Here, three needles are inserted into the haystack at different positions within the large corpus of text; and the model (or system of models) is evaluated on its ability to retrieve all the needles from the haystack given a relevant query. In this particular dataset, the needles are significantly different from the haystack. Specifically, the needles correspond to sentences that contain information about the best ingredients used for making pizza, while the haystack is compiled by stacking essays written by Paul Graham. To compare and contrast different systems, we compute the percentage of needles (x/3 * 100) retrieved from the haystack, while varying the size of the haystack. (We provide this dataset also on hugging face for easy access: Multi-needle HF)\n\nResults\n\nTo understand the effectiveness of these long context window LLMs and RAG systems, we evaluated their performance on the biographies (NIAH) benchmark.\n\nPerformance:\n\nBiographies (NIAH) benchmark\n\nThe biographies benchmark expects the model (or system of models) to retrieve the needle (i.e. natural language text pertaining to a particular individual being asked about) from the haystack and perform reasoning on it in order to report the following pieces of information, when available.\n\nDate of birth: in the format of day, month, and year\n\nDate of death: in the same format as above\n\nNationality: as a string. If not provided in the description, it should be reported as “unknown.”\n\nPolitician: as a boolean. To infer if the individual is a politician based on their description.\n\nSportsperson: as a boolean. To infer if the individual is a sportsperson based on their description.\n\nThe RAG systems evaluated are:\n\nYurts RAG (end-to-end) system coupled with open-source Llama-3-8B-instruct, which has a maximum context window of 8k tokens (blue curve).‍\n\nContextual AI’s RAG 2.0 (red curve) [values obtained from their blog post].\n\nOn the other hand, the LCW model evaluated is GPT-4 that has a maximum context window of 32k tokens (yellow curve). As the maximum context window of the GPT-4 system used in this analysis is 32k, for documents with larger than 32k tokens, we are unable to perform in-context learning to retrieve the needle from the haystack.\n\nAs demonstrated in Figure 2, we find that RAG systems coupled with smaller context window models (blue and red curves) are significantly more performant than the LCW models (yellow curve). Additionally, it is noteworthy that the performance of RAG systems are almost constant as the size of the haystack is varied from 2k to 2M tokens, while the LCW models demonstrate a sharp drop in accuracy as the haystack size increases. The LCW model tested here (GPT-4 32k) has a maximum context window of 32k tokens, making it impossible to evaluate in-context learning on documents with more than 32k tokens. The minor difference between the two RAG systems on the benchmark could be a product of forced JSON creation, which is a well known source of hallucination and degradation[10].\n\nAlthough RAG systems are way more performant than LCW models on this benchmark, we identified a couple of reasons why the RAG systems don’t get a 100% accuracy on the task across different haystack sizes:\n\nModel fails on reasoning: Although the retrieval side of the RAG stack successfully discovered the needle from the haystack and brought it into the context window for the model to infer whether the person was a sportsperson, politician, etc., the model produced a faulty inference. For instance, even though the biographical information pertained to an individual who was a serial killer, the model incorrectly inferred that the person was a sportsperson.\n\nErrors in the ground truth: We also discovered that the ground truth (gold response) in the benchmark was incorrect at times - forcing the score to be lower than a 100%. For instance, when this biography needle: \"alejandra somers ( born 5 april 1908 , date of death unknown ) was an english professional footballer. He was born in catshill\" was inserted into the haystack, the ground truth mentioned that the nationality was “unknown”, while an inference of “English” being the nationality isn’t completely incorrect given the description above.\n\nMulti-needle in a haystack\n\nIn addition to testing the model (or system of models) performance on retrieving a single needle (similar in genre to the haystack), we would like to subject the system to discovering and analyzing multiple hidden needles from a haystack. In this dataset, the hidden needles are distributed across the haystack and are very different in genre from the haystack, with the goal of evaluating if the system can retrieve distributed hidden needles from haystacks with a lot of distracting text.\n\nThe haystack is composed of a collection of Paul Graham’s essays, while the 3 needles inserted in the haystack are:\n\nFigs are one of the secret ingredients needed to build the perfect pizza.\n\nProsciutto is one of the secret ingredients needed to build the perfect pizza.\n\nGoat cheese is one of the secret ingredients needed to build the perfect pizza.\n\nThe retrieval question that different systems are subjected to, for retrieving all the different needles from the haystack, is: “What are the secret ingredients needed to build the perfect pizza?”\n\nFor this multi-needle retrieval analysis, we compare two systems:\n\nYurts RAG (end-to-end) coupled with Llama-3-8B-instruct\n\nGPT-4o with a 128k tokens context window\n\nAs shown in Figure 3, we find that the performance of in-context learning using GPT-4o falls from a perfect 100% as the document size (haystack size) increases. We also note that there are some haystack sizes that are more vulnerable than others, for instance, GPT-4o is able to discover only 1 needle of the 3 inserted needles (~33%) when inserted across different depths in a haystack of size 65k tokens, while the system does much better and retrieves all needles placed across different depths when reading a haystack of size 100k tokens. Also, the accuracy of retrieving needles is zero for haystacks greater than 128k tokens because GPT-4o has a maximum context window size of 128k tokens, preventing in-context learning for larger documents (or haystacks).\n\nOn the other hand, we observe that the Yurts RAG (end-to-end) system is able to retrieve all the needles across the different document (haystack) sizes. We get a perfect retrieval because the retrieval question is very straightforward and does not require any complex reasoning from the coupled LLM (here, Llama-3-8b-instruct).\n\nTo further examine the relationship between the accuracy of needle retrieval with the depth of needle insertion into the haystack, we insert the needle into multiple depths and pose the retrieval question to the system being evaluated.\n\nWe evaluated the mean accuracy over (3 runs) for GPT-4o subjected to the same task, with needles inserted into different depths within the haystack. We find that (Figure 4) GPT-4o typically is successful in retrieving the relevant needles from the haystack when the needle is either placed in the start or end of the document; but struggles when it’s placed within the document. On the other hand, the Yurts RAG system (Figure 5) is able to retrieve the relevant needles irrespective of its position within the haystack - a necessity while working with large volumes of documents within enterprises.\n\nGPU compute requirements / compute costs\n\nHaving demonstrated that the raw accuracy of using smaller RAG systems coupled with smaller context window models is more capable than in-context learning using very long context window models, we want to highlight the compute requirements and costs associated with each of the systems (Table 1).\n\nYurts RAG (end-to-end) combined with Llama-3-8B-instruct requires up to 2 A10 GPUs for single-user operations and can scale to support 50 concurrent users with 4 A10 GPUs. While the RAG approach involves additional retrieval components, such as ElasticSearch, Vector databases, and smaller neural networks, we emphasize GPU requirements as they continue to be the primary cost driver.\n\nOn the other hand, long context window models can require a minimum 40 A10 GPUs for their inference (for a single user). As the number of parameters and architecture of GPT-4o is not public knowledge, we will detail the GPU requirements for an open-source model that has been tuned to endow it with a very long context window. The model we will investigate is Gradient AI’s Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Gradient-1048k. On pilot experiments using this model, we find that for naive hugging face implementation of the model for inference (without any optimizations), the model requires close to 80GB of GPU memory (i.e. a minimum of 3 A10 GPUs) for 16k tokens context window. We estimate that utilizing the entire 1M context window would require close to 1000GB of GPU memory (roughly about 40 A10 GPUs) - for a single user. We believe that using a vllm implementation for inference could enable more concurrency using the same 40 A10 GPU resource.\n\n*A10 is a commercial GPU with a max GPU memory of 24GB. We use the costs (1.624$/hr) of renting GPU’s on-demand via AWS cloud for our cost evaluation.\n\nRAG: A necessary filter before the LLM\n\nAs some of the longer context window models are available via API and are charged on a per token basis, we would like to demonstrate that applying a RAG filter on the entire document corpus prior to using long context window models is both efficient and cost-effective. For instance, we demonstrate that applying RAG on the Biographies benchmark (described above), consistently filtered out very short pieces of text from the large document (haystack) (for feeding to the LLM) ultimately ensuring that the model can perform in-context learning accurately and cost-effectively on the shorter context.\n\nFor instance in Figure 6, we find that despite the increasing haystack size (from 2k to 2M tokens), the effective context window (i.e. RAG filtered context fed to the smaller context window LLM) is typically in the range of 250 to 350 tokens. As recent work[11] has demonstrated that open-source models are best performant on reasoning and analysis tasks when provided with shorter contexts (or prompts), we believe RAG as an efficient filter coupled with an LLM would provide for a highly performant system.\n\nConclusions and future work:\n\nConclusions:\n\nWe have demonstrated that RAG systems are way more performant than LCW models on popular academic benchmarks (like the Needle in a haystack variants) developed to test the effectiveness of long context window models.\n\nMoreover, we have shown that RAG systems can easily scale to large document corpora, as exemplified with documents containing 2 million tokens, without any degradation in performance or accuracy.\n\nIn addition to performance improvements, we note that RAG systems require very low compute resources as compared to long context window models - making the former a perfect candidate for enterprise adoption of Generative AI.\n\nFor an in-depth comparison of Yurts’ RAG performance and its cost-effectiveness relative to state-of-the-art methods, check out our blog on how Yurts’ RAG system delivers high performance without breaking the bank.\n\nFuture work:\n\nAlthough we’ve shown that long context window models are simultaneously performance inadequate and cost-ineffective compared to their RAG counterparts (specifically the Yurts RAG system), we encourage the community to build better academic benchmarks that truly highlight the unique abilities of LCW models, which cannot be matched by smaller systems. For instance, designing tasks and benchmarks that genuinely necessitate very long contexts for the completion of user workflows.\n\n‍\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://research.ibm.com/blog/larger-context-window\n\nhttps://gradient.ai/blog/the-haystack-matters-for-niah-evals\n\nhttps://www.ai21.com/blog/7-long-context-trends-in-the-enterprise\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1b05zpe/i_cant_emphasize_enough_how_mindblowing_extremely/\n\nhttps://github.com/anyscale/long-context-fine-tuning-blogpost/\n\nhttps://github.com/gkamradt/LLMTest_NeedleInAHaystack\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13718\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14196\n\nhttps://contextual.ai/introducing-rag2/\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02442v1\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06910\n\n‍\n\n‍",
      "# [Maximizing ROI: Advanced Strategies for AI Investments by Mark Allen](https://www.yurts.ai/blog/advanced-strategies-for-maximizing-roi-on-ai-investments-in-enterprises)\nHighlights\n\nDiscover advanced strategies to maximize the return on your AI investments.\n\nAnalytics is key: Collect data to understand AI's impact and drive improvements\n\nCategorize solutions: Assess ROI based on vertical or horizontal implementation\n\nNurture adoption: Encourage widespread use and gather feedback for optimization\n\nMeasuring and optimizing ROI is an ongoing process. Keep reading to learn how to recoup your AI investment and thrive with enhanced efficiency and innovation.\n\n‍\n\nIn a previous post, we explored the investment side of return on investment (ROI) in AI within enterprises. Now, it's time to shift our focus to the pivotal aspect of measuring the return. The essence of ROI is not just about deploying AI solutions, but also understanding their impact on your organization's operations and goals. Let's dive into how you can effectively measure and optimize the return on your AI investments.\n\nThe Art of Measurement: Why Analytics is Key\n\nRolling out an AI solution in your enterprise has to be viewed from the perspective of a true internal product. And any product person will tell you that your product will only be as good as the data you collect.\n\nTo measure ROI, data and analytics are your best friends. Deploying a large language model (LLM) or any AI tool isn't the endpoint; rather, it's the start. Understanding how and where it's utilized truly defines its value. It's crucial to get insights into which teams are using the tool, for what purposes, and what tangible outcomes it drives. Just as importantly, that data will tell you where your tool is struggling, allowing you to take another pass.\n\nFraming AI Solutions: Vertical vs. Horizontal\n\nTo effectively measure AI's impact, it's useful to categorize solutions as either vertical or horizontal. This classification provides a framework to assess ROI specificities depending on the nature of the solution implemented.\n\nVertical Solutions: Transformational Impact on Core Functions\n\nVertical solutions are designed to enhance a specific, critical function of your business. Typically, they serve a concentrated group within your workforce. The transformational nature of these solutions makes their impact more straightforward to measure.\n\nFor instance, these solutions aim to improve metrics directly related to their function, such as increasing support ticket velocity, enhancing manufacturing output, or boosting software development productivity. The simple formula here is:\n\n‍\n\nPeople * hours * “things”/hour * = Total number of “things”\n\n\"Things\" could be any measurable unit relevant to your business activities. By tracking the increase in efficiency or output, you can clearly see the return on all your efforts.\n\nHorizontal Solutions: Subtle Changes with Broad Reach\n\nOn the other hand, horizontal solutions have a broader albeit more modest day-to-day impact. These solutions, like generative AI knowledge management solutions, touch nearly every employee and can enhance overall efficiency. One study found that workers spend ~20% of their time looking for information. Even minor gains—like a 5% time savings—can accumulate to create substantial value across the enterprise.\n\nBecause of their diffuse nature, horizontal solutions can be challenging to measure. Here, adoption is your north star. No one likes spinning their wheels finding data, writing boilerplate emails, or coming through the backlog of old email. High adoption rates indicate that the solution is integral to daily activities and suggest a correlation with increased efficiency. Ensuring widespread use and collecting feedback to improve usability are crucial strategies to maximize their impact.\n\nOptimizing Your AI Investment's Return\n\nTo truly optimize your AI ROI, continual evaluation and iteration are essential. Use analytics to revisit and refine the ways your organization uses AI. Encourage cross-departmental communication to spread successful use cases and provide training to enhance AI literacy across teams.\n\nUltimately, measuring and optimizing ROI isn't a one-time task, but rather an ongoing process. By focusing on analytics, categorizing solutions, and nurturing adoption, your organization can recoup its AI investment and thrive with enhanced efficiency and innovation.\n\nRemember, the goal is not merely to implement AI. You want to integrate it meaningfully into the fabric of your enterprise to drive substantial, measurable value.",

AI is not a replacement for us but a partner in our endeavors. Collaboration is the cornerstone for ensuring this transformative technology’s responsible development and deployment.",
      "# [Effective Quantization for Large Language Models by Mike Tong](https://www.yurts.ai/blog/enhancing-enterprise-efficiency-quantization-for-cost-effective-llm-deployment)\nHighlights\n\nDiscover the cost and performance tradeoffs of large language models (LLMs).\n\nQuantization techniques: Reduce memory requirements and costs of LLMs\n\nActivation-aware weight quantization (AWQ): Minimize performance loss post-quantization\n\nYurts' spin on AWQ: Optimize quantization for retrieval augmented generation tasks\n\nKeep reading to learn how Yurts is advancing LLM accessibility through quantization optimizations.\n\n‍\n\nWe don't need to express the impact of Large Language Models (LLMs), and generally how incredible they are. However, not everyone has the economic freedom to host them at scale for their business, especially because the GPU requirements for LLMs can be substantial. Although quantization methods (algorithms that convert a number that initially requires 32 bits of memory to only use 4 bits, i.e. sacrificing mathematical precision for memory efficiency), like AWQ [1] and GPTQ [2] have significantly reduced the barrier to entry, making efficient LLM deployment more accessible. However, businesses still face a significant performance vs. cost tradeoff in LLMs.\n\nBuilding robust LLM systems that are performant and deployable at various form-factors for end-users is key in advancing technology accessibly. We explored the cost <> performance tradeoff introduced by quantization techniques, and identified methods to mitigate performance loss post-quantization, effectively providing high quality LLM responses at a 10th of the compute costs; demonstrated by running a relatively massive 70 billion parameter language model on ~$4,000 worth of GPUs as opposed to a $24,000. In this article we provide a gentle introduction to quantization in LLMs, its promise for reducing operational costs, and ultimately delve into explorations undertaken at Yurts to identify processes that minimize the performance degradation experienced while being used for retrieval augmented generation (RAG) based tasks.\n\nUnderstanding the performance vs. cost tradeoff in LLMs\n\nLLMs perform billions of basic math operations to generate their responses, and use “parameters”, or individually tuned numbers, to do that math. Even though each mathematical operation is simple, they add up to a very complicated algorithm - and cost scales with that complexity. At the moment, the commonly used LLM form-factors are 7B, 13B and 70B, which represents the number of parameters in the LLM (the “B” stands for billion). These parameters are arranged in a structure known as an architecture. These are what phrases like “Mistral” and “Llama” refer to; an arrangement of parameters on which we apply operations to. When a user inputs text, that text interacts with these parameters, and ultimately generates some output -in this case, also text.\n\nGenerally speaking, the more precise these numbers are (i.e. more floating points), the “better” the model response can be - but more precision means each parameter takes up more memory and each computation takes up more resources. Traditionally, these models use 32 bits, or 4 bytes [3] (floating point 32; FP32) to represent a single parameter. As a result, the minimum amount of memory required to load a model for the common form-factors, are 28GB (7B * 4 bytes = 28 billion bytes, or 28GB), 52GB, and 280GB respectively. These values denote the minimum GPU memory required for loading the model, and does not encompass the added memory requirements for running any text generation application.\n\nWhile there are many factors that contribute to the overall cost of running LLMs for enterprises, the GPU is generally the most significant hardware limitation today, both in cost and time to procurement. Cloud makes time to procurement a null problem, but cost remains significant. To put some numbers to these statements, let’s dive a little deeper into GPU cost. Starting with the bare minimum requirement, in today’s market, these costs would roughly be:\n\n2x NVIDIA RTX 4090’s (24G, $2,000 ea as of May ‘24), or a g5.2xlarge AWS EC2 Instance (~$900 per month), to run the smallest model\n\nAround $24,000 to run the largest (12 x NVIDIA RTX 4090), or ~$23,760 / month using a p4d.24xlarge AWS EC2 Instance.\n\nTo make matters worse, NVIDIA RTX GPUs represent consumer grade GPUs that are not recommended for serving models reliably; data center GPUs like the NVIDIA A10 are preferred for LLM serving, which costs around ~$3K for 24GB.\n\nUnfortunately, GPU cost doesn’t scale in a linear fashion with memory requirements. GPUs that have more memory are technologically more advanced, and thus each GB of GPU memory costs more on those devices. For example an A2 with 16 GB of memory costs around $84 per GB, an A10 with 24 GB costs around $130 per GB, and an A40 with 48 GB costs around $280 per GB. This means that running a 70B parameter model is more than 10 times more expensive than running a 7B parameter model - it’s closer to 30 times more expensive if one uses optimal GPU hardware for both. See Figure 1 for the GPU procurement cost per GB of memory for current data center GPUs.\n\nOne can use multiple GPUs to meet the GPU requirement. However, this often leads to performance bottlenecks as data now has to travel inefficiently throughout the system. It’s highly preferred to run models on a single GPU.\n\nQuantization: the silver bullet to cost effectiveness?\n\nWhile companies with seemingly infinite budgets and compute infrastructure race to develop the best models, practitioners and researchers need to find efficient ways to experiment and deploy models without the enormous compute & budget requirements. One common method to accomplish this is through the reduction of precision of the parameters, formally known as quantization. In published studies and our own experiments, reducing the number of decimal places in parameters (i.e., reducing precision from 4 bytes (float32) to 2 bytes (float16)) led to a relatively small performance degradation in comparison to the amount of memory saved. This reduction in precision leads to models using half as much memory, effectively reducing operational requirements by 50% for the same model.\n\nIs this the limit? At what point does quantization start making LLMs worse? Practitioners and researchers have found that storing every parameter as a 2 byte float performs at par with models at higher precision (of 4 bytes or 8 bytes per parameter). However, reducing each parameter to 1 byte or less degrades performance substantially, causing models to generate text that is grammatically incorrect and at times nonsensical.\n\nThe trend of decreasing bytes per parameter negatively impacting text generation performance was observed widely, until Lin et. al. at MIT, JSTU, and Tsinghua University made an interesting discovery about LLMs, and subsequently developed a technique that enables quantization down to under 4 bits (0.5 bytes) without incurring a large drop in performance. In their 2023 paper titled AWQ: Activation-aware Weight Quantization for LLM Compression and Acceleration, Lin et. al. [1] discovered that only 1% of parameters contributed significantly to LLM outputs. What this effectively meant was that nearly 99% of the LLM can be quantized down to a lower precision, if a specific set representing 1% of the model can retain a higher precision (such as float16).\n\nSince most of the model parameters are quantized and stored in a lower precision, we can use that precision (int4) to identify the new memory requirements for the model. When the model’s parameters are stored at 0.5 bytes, the minimum GPU requirements for the 7B, 13B and 70B LLMs become 3.5 GB (7B * 0.5 bytes = 3.5 billion bytes), 6.5 GB, and 35 GB respectively (down from their earlier memory requirements of 28, 52, and 280 GB). Now, the same GPU requirement that was required to run a 7B model at its highest precision can now run the largest 70B model. This means we can now run the largest models on GPUs that cost ~$4,000 instead of $24,000.\n\n“Sounds too good to be true, there must be a catch!” What’s the catch? There’s always a catch right? There absolutely is. While this technique attempts to minimize the error resulting from quantization, it still does not perform quite as well as the original model. Problems such as strange character artifacts and nonsensical responses appear more often in the quantized model. However, AWQ greatly improves model performance over the naive method of simply rounding to the nearest decimal place used in early quantization techniques with a negligible increase in memory overhead. Additionally, it’s important to mention that the larger models are more capable with their responses, even when quantization is performed to bring their overall size down; a larger quantized model may perform better than a smaller non-quantized model of the same memory footprint.\n\nThe Yurts spin on AWQ for simultaneous performance and cost optimization:\n\nA crucial part of the AWQ method is the provision of a calibration dataset for the process. This dataset is used in the quantization process by evaluating how much groups of parameters affect the overall output. Parameters that have a larger impact are adjusted (known as scaling) to minimize the difference between the original model and the quantized one. This can be thought of as feeding some data into the model and quantized model and adjusting the quantized values to best match the original model outputs. In the original paper, it is stated that:\n\n“Our method is less sensitive to the [data] distribution since we only measure the average activation scale from the [data], which is more generalizable across different dataset distributions.”\n\nWhat this means is that the authors generated high quality AWQ-quantized models independent of the dataset used. Although the authors make this claim, at Yurts we discovered during our explorations that the data used for quantization does indeed have a significant impact on the resulting model, especially for a RAG based system. We discovered that the data used for quantization resulted in anywhere from a 1% to 10% difference in similarity to the expected non-quantized response. In addition to memory benefits of AWQ, we have also seen a 2x speed increase in token generation with AWQ in general, ultimately meaning that chat is twice as fast; this is due to kernel layer optimizations.\n\nTo demonstrate the importance of the calibration dataset used during AWQ quantization, Table 1 displays few prompts from the natural instructions dataset [4] and responses from both commercial off the shelf and Yurts’ AWQ models. Here we compare two AWQ models based on Mistral Instruct 7B: one, the highly downloaded AWQ model provided by TheBloke1 [5] on Hugging Face, and the other calibrated on an internal Yurts instructional dataset. All the data used for this blog can be found here; this includes 100 randomly sampled prompts and responses with their similarity scores.\n\n1. These models are publicly available and commonly downloaded on huggingface. These models use casper-hansen’s library called AutoAWQ [6], which defaults to using the Pile Eval [7] dataset for calibration/quantization.\n\nTo quantify the differences we compared model responses with their “expected responses” generated by the non-quantized model. This was done by embedding[2] each model response, then comparing how similar they are to the expected response via cosine similarity. Scores are between 0 and 1.0, with 1.0 being identical, and 0 being completely dissimilar. Figure 2 shows the results of 100 responses.\n\n2. Embeddings were generated using Sentence Transformer’s [8] sBERT model with all-mpnet-base-v2 weights.\n\nFrom this evaluation, it’s clear that the dataset does indeed have a significant impact on the quantization process, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Using our internal instructional dataset the responses are visually much more aligned with natural human responses. We find that over half of the responses from Yurts’ model produce responses that are nearly identical to the original model, as compared to under 10% of the responses in the publicly available AWQ-quantized model on HuggingFace.\n\nWhile we are continuing to explore the optimization of this quantization procedure, Yurts currently provides the ability to quantize models against specific datasets, and in the future, collections, and can seamlessly deploy them for application use. Quantization takes approximately 30 minutes against our internal RAG dataset. We believe models quantized on targeted datasets using AWQ serve as a cost effective alternative to the increasing demands of the latest state of the art models. We use these models internally, and we hope to bring them to your Yurt in the near future.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Lin, Ji, et al. \"Awq: Activation-aware weight quantization for llm compression and acceleration.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.00978 (2023)\n\n[2] Frantar, Elias, et al. \"Gptq: Accurate post-training quantization for generative pre-trained transformers.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.17323 (2022).\n\n[3] Wikipedia contributors. \"Single-precision floating-point format.\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia.

      "# [NVIDIA's Anthony Robbins Secures 7th Wash100 Award for Continuing Efforts to Promote AI in Government by Jerry Petersen on 2024-02-07](https://executivebiz.com/2024/02/nvidias-anthony-robbins-secures-7th-wash100-award-for-continuing-efforts-to-promote-ai-in-government/)\nExecutive Mosaic is pleased to announce that NVIDIA Federal Vice President Anthony Robbins has once again been named a winner of the Wash100 Award, an honor conferred annually to the GovCon industry’s 100 most influential and impactful leaders.\n\nThe Popular Vote Competition of the 2024 Wash100 Award runs through April 30, 2024. Click here to vote for Anthony Robbins as one of your favorite GovCon industry leaders!\n\n2024 marks the 6th straight year that Robbins is part of the list of honorees. It is also his 7th win overall. This year, he is being recognized for his continuing work in promoting the adoption and use of artificial intelligence in the government sector.\n\n“NVIDIA is one of the companies driving the ever-evolving artificial intelligence conversation, and as VP of the company’s federal arm, Anthony is leading NVIDIA’s collaboration with key government agencies, which is especially critical in this era of AI development,” said Jim Garrettson, CEO of Executive Mosaic.\n\n“Anthony works tirelessly to catalyze IT transformation within the federal ecosystem using advanced AI technologies, deep learning, GPU computing and more. Anthony’s continued vision and leadership make him a repeat Wash100 winner,” added Garrettson, founder of the Wash100 Award.\n\n“Every industry has awoken to AI,” Robbins says on LinkedIn, citing how the technology has changed or will change internet companies, startups, transportation and manufacturing. The NVIDIA executive goes on to explain how graphics processing units, his company’s most recognizable product, has facilitated deep learning by taking advantage of immense computational power to allow deep neural networks to discover patterns in copious amounts of data. This GPU-driven computing model “set off a string of ‘superhuman’ achievements in image and speech recognition and sparked the era of AI computing,” Robbins says.\n\nTo promote the use of AI in government would necessarily involve collaborating with agencies. One example is NVIDIA’s partnership with the National Science Foundation, which recently launched the National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource pilot program, whose aim is to improve access to the tools required for the generation of innovations in AI. The company is supporting NAIRR by committing to provide $30 million in technologies over two years with the aim of expanding the program’s scale.\n\nNVIDIA’s efforts to encourage AI use also benefit from the support of its “ecosystem of partners,” which includes Yurts AI and Lambda, the latter of which counts the Department of Defense among its customers. In May last year, the two technology companies teamed up to develop a platform that would provide advanced language processing capabilities, enabling generative AI at the edge.\n\nFor that technology, Yurts AI, a member of the NVIDIA Inception program, developed a large language model that would run on a workstation provided by Lambda. The workstation was powered by NVIDIA GPUs.\n\nCommenting on the collaboration, Robbins pointed out the challenge of running LLMs at secure edge locations and lauded Yurts AI for “helping to broaden the usability of generative AI outside a traditional data center or cloud.”\n\nRobbins’ organization also works to encourage partners in their efforts with AI by honoring them with Partner of the Year awards. The aforementioned Lambda, for example, was recently named 2023 NVIDIA Solution Integration Partner of the Year in the Americas for having provided various industries, including the federal and public sectors, with end-to-end NVIDIA offerings.\n\nAnother example is Microway, a company that delivers NVIDIA-powered systems and AI deployments. Microway’s work in 2022 with customers in the public sector domain earned it the honor of being named the 2023 NVIDIA Public Sector Partner of the Year in the Americas.\n\nRegarding the partnership award, Robbins commented, “Microway’s expertise in providing custom-built AI systems using NVIDIA technology is helping government agencies and enterprises solve their hardest problems, improve energy efficiency and discovery, and make communities safer and more connected.”\n\nExecutive Mosaic congratulates Anthony Robbins and his team at NVIDIA for this latest honor.",

      "# [Roadmap: Defense Tech by Christine Deakers on 2024-01-29](https://www.bvp.com/atlas/roadmap-defense-tech)\nFor years, people thought defense was not a viable market for startups. The prevailing belief was that the Department of Defense (DOD) was limited to the realm of the major primes, including names such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, and General Dynamics. But the future of defense in the United States is undergoing massive technological transformation.\n\nSo what’s changed exactly? Mainly, the DOD now contracts with startups in all technology areas impacting national security, including horizontal domains (e.g., info & analytics, data & systems) and vertical threat vectors, across space, air, land, and sea.\n\nIn this roadmap, we outline how we view the defense tech landscape, why and how entrepreneurs can serve this massive customer, and promising areas for entrepreneurship.\n\nDefining defense tech\n\nAs an umbrella category, defense tech is much broader than rockets, tanks, and aircraft carriers. Defense tech includes everything that the DOD and the broader national security infrastructure touches—including the systems infrastructure, communications and intelligence technology, cybersecurity, advanced manufacturing, as well as the innovation leveraged on the battlefield and beyond.\n\nAt Bessemer, we define defense tech as any business that requires the DOD and defense as a core pillar of growth for the company.\n\nThis assumes the product can be dual use, government only, or currently commercial only but will expand to also be government-focused in the future. Ultimately, this involves a defense-specific product and defense specific go-to-market and sales teams. Read more on our theses here.\n\nSo why now?\n\nThe DOD has new ambitions to overcome the proverbial “valley of death”—the long gap between when a technology is first developed and tested to the time when funds are available in the budget to produce and acquire it. As U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said The Pentagon has great potential to become “a true innovation ecosystem.” Defense technology plays a core role in this generational paradigm shift and so technology businesses should seriously consider adding the DOD as a potential new customer.\n\nStartups can play a role in protecting democracy.\n\nIn 2024, it’s a clear imperative that as geopolitical conflicts around the world intensify, promoting greater innovation within the DOD is an intrinsic part of protecting our country and its allies. Collaborating with emerging startups to gain new solutions is a strategic way for our nation to escape the perilous tendency toward all-out war when a dominant power is challenged by an emerging one (a.k.a. the “Thucydides Trap”). Emerging startups play a significant role in keeping the U.S. clear of this trap, as innovation has historically played an inextricable role in protecting democracy.\n\nFive market opportunities for defense technology startups\n\nMany of the incumbent defense industry businesses need no introduction. They are household names like Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon Technologies. Several of these primes have dominated the industry for decades, some even for close to a century, and currently bring in tens to hundreds of billions in annual revenue.\n\nHowever, within the last decade, a string of trailblazing startups have risen to challenge the prime incumbents. Several of these newcomers have successfully attained public as well as M&A exits for their venture investors including the likes of Palantir and Rocket Lab. Both make the case that younger defense technology businesses can scale effectively to achieve strong fundamentals and attain robust valuation multiples.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of these examples, a diverse ecosystem of defense tech startups has cropped up in recent years, fueled by strong market demand and visionary founders excited to make an impact on national security.\n\nBessemer’s defense tech market map\n\nAs we interviewed founders and experts navigating the massive transitions happening in the defense industry, we have identified five key theses we are particularly excited about investing behind:\n\n1. Cutting-edge AI/ML solutions will be the next frontier of national security\n\nThe defense community is not sitting idly by as the AI revolution sweeps the consumer and commercial industries by storm. The DOD mapped and released its formal AI adoption strategy last year. Advancements and applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning will be essential for the national agenda and the defense community’s day-to-day work. This could look like:\n\nProductivity gains from automation of manual tasks\n\nHigher quality output documents and work products\n\nFaster speed to assessment which is critical in real-time situations\n\nMore accurate insights to drive decisions\n\nInternal DOD champions acknowledge that startups are not only driving the best innovations in the space, but are also the ones with the willingness and courage to disrupt the status quo in order to drive meaningful improvement. Across the department, we’ve already witnessed the embrace of AI/ML applications across various use cases such as Vannevar Labs for foreign text workflows, government sales automation Dextral.ai for government procurement and sales automation, Axion Ray for automation of engineering and quality analytics, and Yurts.ai for enterprise AI across search and documentation.\n\n2. The DOD is embracing the modern data and AI infrastructure stack alongside new network infrastructure innovations\n\nThe success of any modern organization, commercial or federal, is tied to the insights gleaned or products built from its data. The modern data stack is fundamental in the emerging realm of defense tech since intelligence is derived from data of all modalities (video, image, text, speech, etc.).\n\nVarious branches of the government are making major investments to modernize their data and AI infrastructure stack with key requirements across both cloud as well as on-premise deployments. Startups such as Enabled Intelligence for data labeling, Unstructured.io providing ETL for LLMs, and TurbineOne’s MLOps platform are at the frontlines of equipping the defense community with the foundation to leverage the most cutting-edge tools to unlock the most value from their data troves. Similarly, on the network infrastructure side, startups such as Aalyria are pioneering new ways to deliver, connect, and orchestrate networks across different entities.\n\n3. Renewed focus on best-in-class cybersecurity solutions as table stakes\n\nBest-in-class cybersecurity has become synonymous with strong national security in the digital age and the imperative to advance cybersecurity given novel threats continues to grow. But significant headway has been made. For instance, early in 2022, the Office of Management and Budget issued a White House Memorandum setting forth a Federal zero trust architecture (ZTA) strategy, requiring agencies to meet specific cybersecurity standards and objectives by the end of 2024. That same year, the Biden Administration issued Executive Order 14028 on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity.\n\nProtection across all potential legacy and new attack surfaces cannot be understated and we see several technology leaders step in to help. From Bastille Technologies for wireless threat intelligence and Claroty for industry cybersecurity, to Defense Unicorns providing DevSecOps software for air-gapped networks and Virtru for zero-trust data-centric security, numerous startups are driving innovation, reinforcing the Government's defenses against increasingly sophisticated and persistent threat campaigns.\n\n4. The next generation of defense tech giants will be built upon the foundation of verticalized solutions\n\nAt Bessemer, we’ve seen the impact of vertical software transforming every industry, having spent over a decade investing in vertical SaaS leaders such as Procore, Shopify, Toast, among many other leaders. Every commercial industry has specific requirements that may not be fully served by horizontal solutions. With this in mind, we see a similar pattern emerging within the DOD ecosystem. Each branch has specific needs and unique hardware and software stacks, which invite emerging defense tech startups to enter the market by providing purpose-built solutions for vertical threat vectors before leaping across to new verticals and teams. From ShieldAI for AI-piloted aircrafts, to Modern Intelligence providing an all-platform all-sensor maritime awareness solution, to Picogrid offering land-based solutions to connect fragmented defense systems, we expect to see verticalized solutions for different slices of the DOD grow in the coming years.\n\n5. We’re in the early days of autonomous systems reaching its full potential in the defense industry\n\nAs highlighted earlier, autonomous technologies have emerged as a key paradigm for competitive advantage during warfare, and it’s still very early days within the defense tech industry. As the DOD continues exploring this technological paradigm, we expect more interest in startups innovating within the autonomous robotics and technology space.\n\nThe rise of defense tech decacorn Anduril is a testament to the adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and we see many startups following suit, such as Skydio providing autonomous AI-powered drones, Saildrone for uncrewed surface vehicles, and Primodial Labs building voice-controlled autonomy software.\n\nThese aforementioned businesses are just a few examples of how the defense industry is adopting autonomous technology for the battlefield and beyond. As another example, Hadrian is redefining modern manufacturing and Varda is the world’s first orbital manufacturing and reentry platform.\n\nCase study: Evolving defense technology in Ukraine\n\nRapid deployment of advanced technology onto battlefields during conflicts between countries (rather than non-states) represents a revolution in the conduct of military operations. Ukraine illustrates this new reality and how the systems of defense have evolved in recent years. Ukraine is a case study showcasing three areas of defense tech that will need significant and immediate attention: 1) UAVs, 2) cybersecurity, 3) and mass communications and social media.\n\nUAVs: Drones have proven essential for reconnaissance, targeting, and conducting strikes. They can attack one another if needed, and also assist in the movement of supplies and soldiers. Ukraine's armed forces have lost 10,000 drones each month due to Russian electronic warfare (EW). Clearly, today’s conflicts use huge numbers of unmanned aerial systems.\n\nCybersecurity: In Ukraine, cyberspace has also emerged as a crucial battleground for offensive operations. This was exemplified by a recent cyberattack on the country's largest telecom provider, Kyivstar, which marked one of the most significant cyber events in European history. The attack severely disrupted Internet and mobile communications for millions of people, highlighting the growing importance of digital domains in modern conflicts.\n\nMass communications: Social media and news platforms have become fiercely contested arenas too, where the very rapid spread of misinformation and disinformation are menaces to society. How information spreads, and ensuring that it is factual, impacts democracy on a fundamental level. We see an opportunity for entrepreneurs to build solutions that address social and as well as financial fraud, which includes preventing and mitigating social engineering, cybercrimes, including propaganda and novel threats of modern war.\n\nOver 30 U.S. startups have already deployed products in Ukraine, but the need for better technical solutions only grows in the evolving world of military operations. As the nature of conflicts changes, the government must stay on the cutting edge. In this period of rising geopolitical tension and conflict, it seems inevitable that U.S. defense spending will rise significantly in the years ahead.\n\nOur guiding principles on how we will invest in defense technology\n\nAs we survey the landscape of defense tech, there are five qualities and dynamics we look for when investing in these founders and their businesses.\n\n1. High “defense IQ”—While investors have traditionally preferred to invest in dual-use technologies, we are excited to back the frontier of entrepreneurs monetizing mostly (or even solely) via the government. Empirically, higher levels of government concentration demand a higher ability to navigate the complexities of government procurement processes. What this means is that the founding team should have a high “defense IQ” — it earns the company respect and enables federal salespeople to speak the language of contracting officers. A high defense IQ can look like a number of different things, from prior military service in active duty, to career service on the civilian side, to relations with defense agencies from outside the government (e.g., from a prior defense-focused investing role).\n\nDefense IQ earns a startup respect with contracting officers.\n\n2. Expansive TAM—The US defense budget for 2024 is $886 billion, so capturing even a small slice of this market would represent massive potential for the new wave of defense tech startups. That said, the defense budget is sliced and diced across a number of different technological focus areas and shared among the dozens of agencies in the DOD. We’re excited to back companies that can sell technologies solving needs shared across multiple branches of the DOD. Many of these companies can also sell to other liberal governments across the world. For instance, the AUKUS (Australia, UK, and US) partnership involves strategic cooperation on technologies like cybersecurity and AI.\n\n3. Contracts as sticky, large sources of revenue—The holy grail for startups is to get on a DOD Program of Record (PoR). A PoR is an explicit line item in the DOD budget earmarking funds (often on the order of tens of millions of dollars, at least) for the startup’s technology. A PoR is also incredibly sticky, meaning that the funds are typically renewed year-after-year. Beyond the immediate financial windfall, however, being on a PoR also provides unparalleled validation and credibility. Such recognition not only signifies a strong vote of confidence from a defense agency but also opens the door to substantial, sustained funding for other agencies and partners. The fastest time to a PoR is roughly three to four years.\n\nAnother type of contract attractive to startups is the Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. Unlike traditional fixed-price contracts, where the government specifies a set quantity of items or a precise scope of work, an IDIQ contract allows for variations in the amount and timing of orders over a specified period. Under an IDIQ contract, the government agrees to purchase goods or services as needed, up to a predetermined maximum value or quantity. Startups under an IDIQ essentially have a hunting license over the duration of the IDIQ to find defense agencies that suffer from the problems outlined in the IDIQ and serve those needs without initiating a new procurement process each time. IDIQs can be awarded exclusively to one vendor, or to many qualified vendors.\n\nPoRs and IDIQs are merely two types of contracts that DOD awards. Others include cooperative research and development agreements (CRADAs) and OTAs (discussed above). Alternatively, companies might not sell directly to the DOD at all, choosing to act instead as a subcontractor to the large defense primes.\n\n4. Non-dilutive funding—The government is also a great source of non-dilutive funding for startups. The most prominent are Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants, of which there are three “phases.”\n\nPhase I: The goal of a Phase I is to prove the feasibility of a proposed innovation. It typically involves a relatively short-term effort to conduct research and demonstrate the concept's viability. Phase I SBIRs typically last for less than 1 year and award less than $250K.\n\nPhase II: If a company successfully completes Phase I and demonstrates a technology’s feasibility, Phase II SBIRs aim to further develop the innovation through more comprehensive R&D, testing, and prototype development. More mature technologies and companies can go Direct to Phase II (D2P2), without first having to go through Phase I.\n\nPhase III: Only about 5% of companies graduate from Phase II to Phase III SBIRs, posing another “valley of death” in selling to defense. However, unlike the previous phases, Phase III is technically not a direct part of the SBIR program. Instead, it represents the transition of the technology into the commercial market. Funding for Phase III is actually expected to come from sources other than the SBIR program (e.g., government contracts or private investment).\n\nSome defense agencies also have their own specific programs, too. For example, the Air Force has its Strategic Funding Increase (STRATFI) and Tactical Funding Increase (TACFI) programs, which allocate up to $15 million to companies hoping to cross the valley of death from Phase II to Phase III SBIRs.\n\n5. Early traction in selling to the DOD—As mentioned, selling to the government is hard, and the level of difficulty can vary across companies. For example, while all companies need FedRAMP certification, companies that are munitions-adjacent must also comply with the International Trade in Arms Regulation, a more onerous process. Some companies may need federal salespeople or forward-deployed engineers who have Secret / Top-Secret clearance from the FBI. Bessemer does not rule out investments based on these types of sales friction; we especially like teams who have made significant headway in wading through the thicket of regulations and processes required to sell their products.\n\nSelling to the government\n\nThere are complexities and potential risks when selling to the government; many businesses don’t want to take on that additional baggage. However, we think that might be a short-sided approach — the rewards can greatly outweigh the risks.\n\nFor defense tech founders, here are three cons and five pros to adopting a business-to-government (B2G) go-to-market model —\n\nCons of a B2G model\n\nLong sales cycles: Making a deal can take a long time, years even, to land a large, multi-million-dollar contract.\n\nUnpredictability: Government contracts are lumpy, bumpy, and unpredictable. This leads to revenue streams that are hard to forecast, with often very large Q3 results, since the US government fiscal year ends in September.\n\nRed tape: Every three letter government agency has cumbersome levels of bureaucracy. In addition, its political headwinds and various partisanship impacts deal flow and sales cycles.\n\nThink of the DOD as the best beta customer you’ve ever had.\n\nPros of a B2G model\n\nMarket size: From a financial perspective, the U.S. military/intelligence complex is the world’s largest customer with a $886 billion defense budget for 2024 with dozens of branches each acting as independent Fortune 100 companies.\n\nStrong retention: The DOD is a strong brand and a high-retention customer with no credit risk and a high resilience to economic cycles. And once you’re in, it’s straight-forward to expand your contract (high net dollar retention).\n\nProduct innovation: Think of the DOD as the best beta customer you’ve ever had. The government can help you develop and refine your product with unique sources of funding—usually in the form of non-dilutive grants.\n\nGTM distribution advantages: As the DOD budgets become more receptive to working with startups, businesses building out cutting edge technology with defense applications can benefit from securing government contracts as a means to gain market leadership and elbow-out the competitors.\n\nProcurement breakthroughs for startups: Emerging defense startups like SpaceX and Palantir have challenged traditional Defense Department contracting, leading to greater competition and innovation. SpaceX sued the U.S. Air Force in 2014 over exclusive contracts awarded to ULA for national security launches, resulting in policy changes that ended ULA's monopoly. Palantir also sued the U.S. Army in 2016 for excluding commercial solutions in its procurement process, winning the case and forcing the Army to revise its acquisition strategy. These actions have opened doors for more startups to engage with the Department of Defense.\n\nDefense contracting has become more startup-friendly due to new government initiatives and technologies simplifying the process.\n\nOther Transaction Agreements (OTAs) have been key, especially since their expanded use post-2015, in enabling nontraditional contractors to more easily sell to the government. Additionally, initiatives have led to the creation of organizations like the Defense Innovation Unit, AFWERX, and NAVAL X, starting from 2015 onwards, which foster collaboration among private companies and the DOD, streamlining startup engagement with the defense sector.\n\nSo founders, considering these points, could a B2G model be your next avenue of growth?\n\nThe next generation of defense technology\n\nThe recent headway Silicon Valley upstarts have with the DOD does not change the fact that building an enduring defense tech business does not come without significant challenges and pitfalls. Indeed, as the Pentagon and even other investors have recently noted, the influx of capital into defense tech startups must come with realistic expectations. We remain intellectually honest that building an enduring defense tech startup is very hard. R&D obstacles, commercialization challenges, friction in scaling a go-to-market strategy, financing risks, and beyond — what defense tech founders face, at times, can still seem Sisyphean.\n\nWhat defense tech founders face can seem Sisyphean.\n\nYet, as investors in this complex ecosystem, we know how important it is for defense founders to have proper resources and a network of support to drive innovation, secure contracts, and contribute to our country’s agenda.\n\nThis is why we’ve created Bessemer’s Defense Tech Advisory Board including renowned experts such as:\n\nDr. Ray Johnson (CEO, Technology Innovation Institute, and former SVP and CTO, Lockheed Martin Corporation)\n\nLori Garver (former Deputy Administrator of NASA)\n\nRet. Major General Kim Crider (former Chief Technology and Innovation Officer for the United States Space Force and former Chief Data Officer of the United Space Air Force)\n\nRet. Lt. Gen. S. Clinton Hinote (former Deputy Chief of Staff, Strategy, Integration, and Requirements for the United States Air Force)\n\nForrest Underwood (Founder, United States Space Force Reservist, and former Chief Growth officer of True Anomaly)\n\nMatthew J. Kohler (former 3-Star Vice Admiral, former Director of Naval Intelligence, Director of Navy Information Warfare, Deputy Navy Chief Information Officer, Deputy Commander, 10th Fleet/Fleet Cyber Command)\n\nJoshua Marcuse (Director of Strategic Initiatives & Responsible AI Lead for Google Public Sector, and former Executive Director of the Defense Innovation Board, Department of Defense)\n\nGiven our long track record of partnering with companies at the intersection of defense and deep technology, including Skybox Imaging, Rocket Lab, Endgame, Spire Global, Claroty, and Virtru, we have various sales playbooks as well as metrics benchmarking reports specific to defense tech to help go-to-market teams navigate the federal sales landscape.

      "# [We’ve come a long way from RPA: How AI agents are revolutionizing automation by Rohan Sharma, Zenolabs, Rohan Sharma on 2024-12-16](https://venturebeat.com/ai/weve-come-a-long-way-from-rpa-how-ai-agents-are-revolutionizing-automation/)\nIn the past year, the race to automate has intensified, with AI agents emerging as the ultimate game-changers for enterprise efficiency. While generative AI tools have made significant strides over the past three years — acting as valuable assistants in enterprise workflows — the spotlight is now shifting to AI agents capable of thinking, acting and collaborating autonomously. For enterprises preparing to embrace the next wave of intelligent automation, understanding the leap from chatbots to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications to autonomous multi-agent AI is crucial. As Gartner noted in a recent survey, 33% of enterprise software applications will include agentic AI by 2028, up from less than 1% in 2024.\n\nAs Google Brain founder Andrew Ng aptly stated: “The set of tasks that AI can do will expand dramatically because of agentic workflows.” This marks a paradigm shift in how organizations view the potential of automation, moving beyond predefined processes to dynamic, intelligent workflows.\n\nThe limitations of traditional automation\n\nDespite their promise, traditional automation tools are constrained by rigidity and high implementation costs. Over the past decade, robotic process automation (RPA) platforms like UiPath and Automation Anywhere have struggled with workflows lacking clear processes or relying on unstructured data. These tools mimic human actions but often lead to brittle systems that require costly vendor intervention when processes change.\n\nCurrent gen AI tools, such as ChatGPT and Claude, have advanced reasoning and content generation capabilities but fall short of autonomous execution. Their dependency on human input for complex workflows introduces bottlenecks, limiting efficiency gains and scalability.\n\nThe emergence of vertical AI agents\n\nAs the AI ecosystem evolves, a significant shift is occurring toward vertical AI agents — highly specialized AI systems designed for specific industries or use cases. As Microsoft founder Bill Gates said in a recent blog post: “Agents are smarter. They’re proactive — capable of making suggestions before you ask for them. They accomplish tasks across applications. They improve over time because they remember your activities and recognize intent and patterns in your behavior. “\n\nUnlike traditional software-as-a-service (SaaS) models, vertical AI agents do more than optimize existing workflows; they reimagine them entirely, bringing new possibilities to life. Here’s what makes vertical AI agents the next big thing in enterprise automation:\n\nElimination of operational overhead: Vertical AI agents execute workflows autonomously, eliminating the need for operational teams. This is not just automation; it’s a complete replacement of human intervention in these domains.\n\nUnlocking new possibilities: Unlike SaaS, which optimized existing processes, vertical AI fundamentally reimagines workflows. This approach brings entirely new capabilities that didn’t exist before, creating opportunities for innovative use cases that redefine how businesses operate.\n\nBuilding strong competitive advantages: AI agents’ ability to adapt in real-time makes them highly relevant in today’s fast-changing environments. Regulatory compliance, such as HIPAA, SOX, GDPR, CCPA and new and forthcoming AI regulations can help these agents build trust in high-stakes markets. Additionally, proprietary data tailored to specific industries can create strong, defensible moats and competitive advantages.\n\nEvolution from RPA to multi-agent AI\n\nThe most profound shift in the automation landscape is the transition from RPA to multi-agent AI systems capable of autonomous decision-making and collaboration. According to a recent Gartner survey, this shift will enable 15% of day-to-day work decisions to be made autonomously by 2028. These agents are evolving from simple tools into true collaborators, transforming enterprise workflows and systems. This reimagination is happening at multiple levels:\n\nSystems of record: AI agents like Lutra AI and Relevance AI integrate diverse data sources to create multimodal systems of record. Leveraging vector databases like Pinecone, these agents analyze unstructured data such as text, images and audio, enabling organizations to extract actionable insights from siloed data seamlessly.\n\nWorkflows: Multi-agent systems automate end-to-end workflows by breaking complex tasks into manageable components. For example: Startups like Cognition automate software development workflows, streamlining coding, testing and deployment, while Observe.AI handles customer inquiries by delegating tasks to the most appropriate agent and escalating when necessary.\n\nReal-world case study: In a recent interview, Lenovo’s Linda Yao said, “With our gen AI agents helping support customer service, we’re seeing double-digit productivity gains on call handling time. And we’re seeing incredible gains in other places too. We’re finding that marketing teams, for example, are cutting the time it takes to create a great pitch book by 90% and also saving on agency fees.”\n\nReimagined architectures and developer tools: Managing AI agents requires a paradigm shift in tooling. Platforms like AI Agent Studio from Automation Anywhere enable developers to design and monitor agents with built-in compliance and observability features. These tools provide guardrails, memory management and debugging capabilities, ensuring agents operate safely within enterprise environments.\n\nReimagined co-workers: AI agents are more than just tools — they are becoming collaborative co-workers. For example, Sierra leverages AI to automate complex customer support scenarios, freeing up employees to focus on strategic initiatives. Startups like Yurts AI optimize decision-making processes across teams, fostering human-agent collaboration. According to McKinsey, “60 to 70% of the work hours in today’s global economy could theoretically be automated by applying a wide variety of existing technology capabilities, including gen AI.”\n\nFuture outlook: As agents gain better memory, advanced orchestration capabilities and enhanced reasoning, they will seamlessly manage complex workflows with minimal human intervention, redefining enterprise automation.\n\nThe accuracy imperative and economic considerations\n\nAs AI agents progress from handling tasks to managing workflows and entire jobs, they face a compounding accuracy challenge. Each additional step introduces potential errors, multiplying and degrading overall performance. Geoffrey Hinton, a leading figure in deep learning, warns: “We should not be afraid of machines thinking; we should be afraid of machines acting without thinking.” This highlights the critical need for robust evaluation frameworks to ensure high accuracy in automated processes.\n\nCase in point: An AI agent with 85% accuracy in executing a single task achieves only 72% overall accuracy when performing two tasks (0.85 × 0.85). As tasks combine into workflows and jobs, accuracy drops further. This leads to a critical question: Is deploying an AI solution that’s only 72% correct in production acceptable? What happens when accuracy declines as more tasks are added?\n\nAddressing the accuracy challenge\n\nOptimizing AI applications to reach 90 to 100% accuracy is essential. Enterprises cannot afford subpar solutions. To achieve high accuracy, organizations must invest in:\n\nRobust evaluation frameworks: Define clear success criteria and conduct thorough testing with real and synthetic data.\n\nContinuous monitoring and feedback loops: Monitor AI performance in production and utilize user feedback for improvements.\n\nAutomated Optimization Tools: Employ tools that auto-optimize AI agents without relying solely on manual adjustments.\n\nWithout strong evaluation, observability, and feedback, AI agents risk underperforming and falling behind competitors who prioritize these aspects.\n\nLessons learned so far\n\nAs organizations update their AI roadmaps, several lessons have emerged:\n\nBe agile: The rapid evolution of AI makes long-term roadmaps challenging. Strategies and systems must be adaptable to reduce over-reliance on any single model.\n\nFocus on observability and evaluations: Establish clear success criteria. Determine what accuracy means for your use case and identify acceptable thresholds for deployment.\n\nAnticipate cost reductions: AI deployment costs are projected to decrease significantly. A recent study by a16Z found that the cost of LLM inference has dropped by a factor of 1,000 in three years; the cost is decreasing by 10X every year. Planning for this reduction opens doors to ambitious projects that were previously cost-prohibitive.\n\nExperiment and iterate quickly: Adopt an AI-first mindset. Implement processes for rapid experimentation, feedback and iteration, aiming for frequent release cycles.\n\nConclusion\n\nAI agents are here as our coworkers. From agentic RAG to fully autonomous systems, these agents are poised to redefine enterprise operations. Organizations that embrace this paradigm shift will unlock unparalleled efficiency and innovation. Now is the time to act. Are you ready to lead the charge into the future?",
