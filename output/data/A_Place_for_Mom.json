      "# [What Is Senior Living? Costs, Benefits and Options by Jess Mathews on 2024-02-19](https://www.aplaceformom.com/senior-living)\nSenior living encompasses a range of housing and care options for older adults, from senior apartments and independent living communities for active seniors to nursing homes for those with significant medical needs. Determining who needs senior living and what type of community they should live in depends on how much care they need:\n\nSenior apartments and independent living communities: The senior meets community age requirements and doesn’t need any care services.\n\nHome care and assisted living communities: The senior needs help with a couple of activities of daily living (ADLs), such as bathing and eating, but is otherwise independent.\n\nMemory care: The senior has symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease or another type of dementia, and they need help with ADLs.\n\nNursing homes: The senior needs skilled medical care for short-term or long-term conditions.\n\nThe costs and amenities of each community usually depend on the level of care provided and whether or not residents are given a maintenance-free, all-inclusive experience. Each senior living option is detailed below to help you find the best community for your needs.\n\nSenior living options range from senior apartments and other 55+ communities to nursing homes. The biggest difference between each option is the level of care they provide to residents.\n\nFor independent seniors who don’t need assistance, senior apartments or independent living may be the right fit. Active seniors who need help with activities of daily living (ADLs) may strike a balance of independence and support in assisted living communities or board and care homes. However, seniors with complex health conditions or a form of dementia may benefit more from memory care communities or nursing homes.\n\nDepending on the needs of the senior, home care or home health care may be a good fit. Home care services can provide companionship and daily support, while home health care services can offer prescribed in-home skilled nursing care.\n\nTypically, the more specialized a senior living option is, the more it will cost. For example, nursing homes remain the most expensive senior living option while offering the highest level of care possible outside of a hospital setting. Other features like location, care type, floor plan, services and amenities, and pricing model will affect the monthly cost of senior care.\n\nKnowing what real families paid for care options can help you better plan for care and understand your budget. Below, you’ll see the monthly median senior living costs across the nation based on data from A Place for Mom’s 2024 Cost of Long-Term Care and Senior Living Report.\n\nWhen it comes time to cover the costs of senior care, families use both private and public pay options. Private payment methods include using funds from personal accounts, retirement savings, social security, and insurance. Some families may use public pay options, like Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans benefits.\n\nFinding the right senior living option comes down to three questions: What are your needs, what are your retirement goals, and what is your budget? Knowing the answer to these questions should help you narrow down which option will fit your family’s needs best. For example, if your loved one doesn’t require care services, but wants to pursue new hobbies and make new friendships, independent living might be a better option than a senior apartment or assisted living environment.\n\nAbove all else, the best way to determine which senior living option is best is to tour. Touring allows families to meet community staff and residents, ask questions, evaluate floor plans, and truly get a sense of what life in that community would look like. According to our data, 97% of families tour before making a final decision about their senior living options.\n\nMoving can be a big adjustment, which is why it’s best to plan ahead. Consider the significant change you or a senior loved one will go through. A successful move is key for a positive transition into a new environment and lifestyle.\n\nBelow are some top tips for an easy senior living move:\n\nChoose one room at a time for packing and downsizing.\n\nConsider hiring a professional senior relocation service.\n\nWork with a geriatric care manager to make sure there is e access to health care providers and prescriptions after the move.\n\nConsider mobility needs to find the best way to travel, whether by car or plane.",
      "# [What Is Memory Care? Services, Cost, and Benefits by seanleong on 2024-02-09](https://www.aplaceformom.com/alzheimers-care)\nMemory care is a type of long-term care community designed to meet the specific needs of individuals with a dementia diagnosis, like Alzheimer’s disease or another form of dementia. Memory care facilities offer 24-hour care and supervision, secured environments, specialized staff trained in dementia care, and memory-enhancing activities and therapies. Memory care can take place in apartment-like facilities, within a wing of an assisted living facility, or in smaller residential care homes. The goal of memory care is to provide an engaging, safe, and therapeutic environment for seniors with dementia to support their well-being and improve their quality of life. Individuals in the middle to later stages of dementia benefit most from a memory care environment.\n\nBenefits of memory care\n\nBecause dementia symptoms worsen over time, elderly adults with dementia are often unable to continue to live independently in their homes. If a family member is unable to take on the caregiver role, which can quickly become a full-time job, memory care is a great option. Memory care not only benefits seniors with dementia but also families who are feeling overwhelmed by their loved one’s advanced care needs. It gives families peace of mind that their loved one is in a secure and therapeutic environment with caregivers trained to handle difficult dementia behaviors.\n\nRead on to learn all about memory care benefits, specialized services, costs, and payment options. We also offer free tips on finding and moving to a community in your area.\n\nThe median national cost of memory care is $6,200 per month, according to proprietary data gathered by A Place for Mom. Costs vary greatly between communities and depend on factors like location, community amenities, programming, apartment size, and the level of care a senior requires. Pricing models also vary. For instance, some memory care communities may be all-inclusive, while others may use an a la carte approach and charge based on services required by a resident.\n\nMemory care base costs typically cover rent, utilities, meals and snacks, housekeeping, transportation to medical appointments, on-site activities, nonmedical therapies, and shared amenities. However, some amenities — such as in-unit internet service, beauty and barber services, laundry, and pet accommodations — may cost extra.\n\nWhile many families look to savings to finance senior care, there are other little-known funding sources that can help. The articles below can help you better understand pricing and the options available to help pay for memory care.",
      "# [What is a Nursing Home? Services, Cost and Options by Grace Hobson on 2024-02-26](https://www.aplaceformom.com/nursing-homes)\nNursing homes, also called skilled nursing facilities, provide 24-hour nursing and personal care for seniors. Nursing homes offer the highest level of care for seniors who need long-term or short-term medical care but don’t need hospitalization. Elderly adults who need long-term care at a nursing home often have severe physical or cognitive health conditions that require 24-hour nursing care. They may be incontinent, unable to eat independently, or unable to transfer from bed to a wheelchair without the assistance of a staff member.\n\nNursing homes play a crucial role in post-hospitalization care. They offer short-term rehabilitation for seniors recovering from illnesses, accidents or surgery. Rehab care focuses on restoring mobility, strength, and function so seniors can get back to their normal activities.\n\nNursing homes provide a distinctly higher level of medical care than other types of senior living, such as independent living, assisted living, and memory care. Nursing homes can also be called “care homes,” “skilled rehab facilities,” or “long-term care facilities.”\n\nElderly nursing home residents often have significant physical or mental health conditions that require long-term, 24-hour nursing and personal care. Seniors who can no longer lift themselves out of bed or who require daily skilled nursing are often ineligible for assisted living or memory care and may need nursing home care.\n\nFinding a nursing home for your loved one may feel overwhelming. You may have many different facilities to choose from, so how do you know which one is right? Start with your family member’s prioritized needs and consider the facility’s medical services and ratings.\n\nUltimately, there’s no substitute for visiting and experiencing a typical day at the nursing home. As you tour different facilities, be sure to ask whether the nursing home you’re visiting is Medicare or Medicaid certified and licensed if you plan on using your benefits to help cover your care costs there. You can also check the facility’s rating on the Medicare website.\n\nUse these resources to discover what to look for when searching for a nursing home and how to find the best nursing homes near you.\n\nNursing homes are more expensive than assisted living or memory care because they require medically trained staff and more supervision. Nursing homes may cost twice as much as assisted living or memory care facilities in your area.\n\nPaying for a nursing home is not always straightforward, and families can use multiple sources to cover nursing home costs. Often, some nursing home care can be covered with Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, or veterans benefits. Short-term stays in skilled nursing facilities for rehabilitation may be covered by Medicare, while indefinite stays in a nursing home will require some out-of-pocket payment for rent and meals. Learning how to pay for nursing home care now can help you plan for your future needs.\n\nA Place for Mom has the largest network of senior living communities and home care providers in the nation. We enable caregivers to make the best decisions for their loves ones.",

      "# [108 Communities](https://www.aplaceformom.com/providers/atria-21)\nExcellent Choice\n\nWe have had a wonderful experience and highly recommend Atria Forest Hills. My mother's days were filled with so much to do. The best part was when she said she enjoyed spending the winter days inside, not having to leave home in the cold to meet her friends. It's like an all-inclusive club right where you live. Much thanks to the staff for all the good work you have done!\n\nI enjoyed a lot in here!\n\nI was hesitant in moving here at Atria but on my first day here i am already engaging with my fellow neighbors. The ambassadors welcomed me had meals with us and inviting us for activities. The staff are awesome as well. I had a great time with my first outing in the Paleontology Museum. and church services here are held twice a week which I really love.\n\nFriendly Staff and Warm Atmosphere\n\nI can only share my experience from the tour I took. The staff were very friendly and helpful. My tour guide was thorough, addressing all my questions and providing detailed information about the different levels of care and pricing. Although the facility is relatively small, it has a close-knit, community-like feel. During my visit, someone was playing the piano and singing, which created a warm and inviting atmosphere. I highly recommend this place, especially for those seeking more independent living. However, if extensive care and assistance are required, it could be costly—though this is true for practically all assisted living facilities.\n\nPositives, Across the Board. Highly Recommend\n\n5 for all - with these comments: I came to the Atria scouting out a residence for my mother-in-law. The tour I received and the welcome I was given were both wonderful. I was most impressed by their \"we can help with that\" attitude. The facilities are beautiful, the staff friendly and efficient, and the activities offered thorough and varied. She ultimately did move in and her experience has exceeded even the expectations we had. All her needs have been effectively met. She is very happy at the Atria - which makes my wife and me happy, too!\n\nThe Next Best Thing to Home\n\nNo place is perfect but Atria was perfect for my mother. She was very social. She lived in memory care but we brought her to the first floor for coffee and a muffin regularly. She would ask everyone we saw, \"Do you know me?\" It didn't matter who it was, the person always responded, \"Of course I know who you are, [name removed]!\" The staff really got to know and love her. The job of an RSA is hardly a glamorous one. I will spare you the details of some of the things they did for my mother. Suffice it to say - the RSAs are the real heros at Atria. Upper staff is very accessible and communicative. I was there a lot and I got to know everyone. They listen to your concerns and accommodate you in any way that they can. I read some of Atria's reivews. Yes, it is very expensive. We knew that when we moved my mother in. We never worried while she was there, we always knew she was safe. If you choose not to or are unable to care for your loved one at home, Atria is the next best thing.\n\nEureka!\n\nAs soon as I entered, I knew I was on the right path to finding a new home for my dad. First of all, you are aware of the pride that is taken in the attention to detail in the beautiful environment. Secondly, the kind staff goes the extra mile to make sure all is taken care of. The staff makes a personal effort to greet each resident by name, which makes people feel a part of a community. In addition, each resident has his/her own private living space. The studio apartment that my dad has is perfect for his needs. Take a tour. I am sure you will be impressed. Dad loves it and so do I.\n\nStaff that cares\n\nI would suggest that they take a tour and also go to one of their open house activities so they get a better feel for the place. I like the friendly staff that treats my mom like family and appreciate that they give necessary updates when they see fit. The memory care staff are caring and patient so I'm grateful for finding them.\n\nHelpful, responsive and supportive!\n\nWe worked with Atria over a period of six months to transition my Aunt from her Manhattan apartment into their Riverdale community. Our situation was complicated by the fact that no family lives in New York, so everything was done by phone and video conference. Throughout the process, Atria was patient, flexible, and very responsive. They helped to ease some of the stress and now, we have peace of mind that my Aunt will be safe and her needs met. She just moved in and we are hopeful she will find a rich and rewarding life at Atria.",
      "# [Ebenezer Senior Living](https://www.aplaceformom.com/providers/ebenezer-655)\nA great fit for mom\n\nMy mother loves it there and we have been impressed with their all around customer service. For our mother, walking into Champlin Shores felt like home. It wasn't too big, it wasn't too small. The vibe in the lobby area was that people enjoyed visiting with each other, and if you were to stop in at any given time, they usually are a few people down there to socialize. The staff have always been very friendly. We have had a few meals with our mother, the food was well prepared and tasteful. By the end of the first week, all the staff knew my mother's name, and called her by name when speaking with her. For us, Champlin Shores has been the perfect fit for our mothers next home.\n\nJob well done\n\nI would start off with a tour and a meeting with the community director. She will help you through the community and it would be a wonderful experience for you and your loved one. They have activities like dancing, bingo, tea parties and more for the residents to do at this community to stay active. They also have birthday parties for everyone in the unit.\n\nHighly recommend\n\nWe chose Oak Meadows because they had everything we were looking for. It is such a welcoming atmosphere when you walk in and the price was right. The staff are over the top incredible. The apartment sizes are very nice and perfect for what they need. They absolutely love it here and I would highly recommend them.\n\nI would recommend\n\nWe chose Trail of Orono because of the location, the facility itself, and the staff members really sold us. The room sizes are pretty standard compared to others that we looked into. They do have a lot of activities they do with the residents. They are truly willing to work with families to make sure you are comfortable and are great with communication. I would recommend them.\n\nHighly recommend\n\nWe chose Trails of Orono because of the location to family as well as the fact that it is a smaller community, so it is more home like rather than institutional. I have also heard good things from friends with loved ones here so they have a good reputation. They email us with any updates and have been great with communication, I have been impressed. Using the primary care physicians that are brought in has made coordination of care so much easier. It has been a great experience so far and I would recommend them.\n\nA Very Good Choice!\n\nWe moved my brother to the Sanctuary [date removed]. It is a beautiful place, very clean with a kindhearted staff. The nurses are responsive, the care attendants are the best, and the staff overall are attentive and caring. I have no doubt that my brother LOVES living here. I highly recommend the Sanctuary to anyone who is seeking assisted living! It's the BEST St. Cloud has to offer!\n\nGood so far\n\nSo far so good! :) Mom and Dad have only been there a few months but it has been wonderful. So much to do for them, good food, Lots of activities, very nice staff. I like the fact that it is so bright and beautiful place.\n\nTop Notch.\n\nTrails is a fantastic place. Both of my parents are there and I couldn't be happier. The food is terrific and they offer many activities. Healthcare is wonderful at Trails. They are on top of things and make sure their residents are well taken care of. VERY happy with Trails of Orono,\n\nGreat Place\n\nWe absolutely love York Gardens. I highly recommend it for anyone who is looking a home like feel. We love the privacy we get with the individual units and plenty of space. Food is great, staff is very friendly, very clean and plenty of space to spread out.\n\nGood place for mom\n\nMy mother is a new resident and loves her apartment and this community. She has been very quickly welcomed by other residents and is forming some friendships. She loves the food, has been on a few outings and the convenience of the Edina Senior Senior across the street along with shopping. We are satisfied with our choice of Vernon Terrace.",

      "# [Review moderation and publishing process](https://support.aplaceformom.com/docs/review-process)\nModeration Process\n\nReviews are one of the best ways to help families select the best option for their loved one.\n\nThe reviews provide residents/clients and their family/friends with an opportunity to share their experience, whether giving praise or constructive criticism. In turn, communities/agencies are able to share this feedback with their teams in order to celebrate their success and make changes where appropriate.\n\nOur rigorous publishing process ensures that the reviews on aplaceformom.com are genuine and compliant with our review policy.\n\nThis page explains the journey of a review on aplaceformom.com, outlining each stage of the process.\n\n1. A review is written and submitted\n\nThe process begins when a resident/client or their family/friend writes and submits a review either through our website or by sending in a Review Card provided by the community/agency. This can be on their own initiative or by invitation from a community/agency.\n\nWe require the name and telephone/email of the reviewer so that we can authenticate reviews.\n\nWho can submit a review?\n\nReviews may be submitted by anyone who has engaged with the community/agency with the exception of current or former employees. Most often reviewers include residents/clients and their family/friends. Reviewers can also include individuals who have toured a community and service providers to the community/agency.\n\n2. Pre-screening of review\n\nIn stage two, the review is received by aplaceformom.com and entered into our database by our Review Team. The team verifies that the review adheres to our Review Policy.\n\nIf the review is incomplete it will not be published. However, the Review Team will attempt to contact the reviewer in an effort to obtain missing information.\n\n3. Review authentication\n\nTo ensure that the review is genuine and the person who submitted the review has a valid connection to the community/agency, the review goes through an authentication process.\n\nWe have a number of automated data checks to authenticate reviews, these are:\n\nHas the reviewer done a previous review?\n\nHas the reviewer’s email address been used before?\n\nIs the review comment the same as another one?\n\nIf confirmed authentic, the review will move to publication. Please allow 5-7 business days for a review to be published.\n\nReview Status\n\nUnder the ‘Your Reviews’ tab in the Control Panel you can view all the reviews that have been published for your setting.\n\nPublished Reviews\n\nPublished Reviews includes all reviews that have been authenticated and posted to your aplaceformom.com webpage. Once a review is published, you can then respond to it from this page using the Add a Reply button.\n\nThere is a wealth of information available on this page including the the name of the reviewer (if they chose to include it in their review), the date the review was submitted, the date is was published, any comments provided by the reviewer and the individual star ratings across categories.\n\nAt the top of the page is a filter option which will allow you to filter all published reviews by these attributes and others. For example, you may filter by reviews submitted during a specific time period or you may select all reviews that have not yet been replied to.\n\nReview responses\n\nThe Review Team verifies all review responses before publication to ensure they comply with the Content Standards.\n\nReview responses must not reveal specific personal information about the reviewer, the resident/client or a third party.\n\nPlease reply to all reviews within 30 business days.",
      "# [Review Score](https://support.aplaceformom.com/docs/review-score)\nWhat is the new Review Score?\n\nA Place for Mom's Review Score provides comprehensive consideration for the quantity of positive reviews as well as the average rating of a community's reviews, and only includes the most recent and relevant reviews.\n\nThe 10-point Review Score excludes reviews over 24 months old and reviews from individuals with limited community engagement (e.g., tour reviews).\n\nIntroduced on aplaceformom.com in June 2023, the Review Score provides improved insight into a community's / provider's recent performance vs a five-star average rating of reviews over all time.\n\nHow is my score calculated?\n\nA Place for Mom's Review Score can range from 1 (the lowest) to 10 (the highest).\n\nAll reviews (excluding tour reviews) submitted in the last 24 months are included in the Review Score calculation.\n\nIf a community/provider has no reviews in the last 24 months it will have no Review Score vs a Review Score of zero.\n\n5 points are available for review rating. Review rating is measured using the average 'overall experience' rating of the reviews.\n\nA review can have an 'overall experience' rating of 1 - 5, which equals 1 - 5 points.\n\n5 points are available for the number of positive reviews. A positive review is defined as a review with an 'overall experience' rating of 4+\n\nFor Assisted Living Communities, Memory Care Facilities, Independent Living and Nursing Homes:\n\nFifteen-plus positive reviews are required for the full 5 points. 1st review = 3.0, 2nd= 0.5, 3rd=0.4, 4th=0.3, 5=0.2, and 6-7th=0.1, 8th-15th=0.05 each.\n\nFor Residential Care Homes, Senior Apartments and Home Care Providers:\n\nFive-plus positive reviews are required for the full 5 points. 1st review = 3.5, 2nd= 0.5, 3rd=0.5, 4th=0.25, 5th = 0.25\n\nOrganization Review Scores\n\nThese are calculated using the average of all Reviews Scores of community's/provider's belonging to the organization\n\nHow recent are the reviews included in my score?\n\nReviews less than 24 months old will be counted toward your score. Only reviews written by residents or family & friends of residents will count.\n\nWhy are tour reviews not included in the score?\n\nWhile tour reviews provide valuable insight into how well your staff conducts tours, they often do not provide insight into daily life in the community, like activities, care, and other post move-in areas that are important to families.\n\nHow can I increase my current score?\n\nInvite more residents, families & friends of residents to submit reviews. You can see how to generate new reviews via email, social media, WhatsApp, and in your community via review postcards and printable QR codes in the Generate & Showcase section of the Reputation Portal.\n\nHow can I generate more reviews for my community?\n\nLog into your Reputation Portal account and select the Generate & Showcase tab. There, you can easily invite residents, families & friends of residents to review your community via social media, email, WhatsApp, or any other digital medium through a link that can be copied and pasted. You can also print a QR code and order review postcards that can be physically displayed in your community, giving easy access to visiting family.\n\nWhen is the best time to ask for a review?\n\nWe have found that the best reviews come from residents or family & friends of residents after move-in. Best practice is to invite families and residents to review your community at the 30 day, 6 month, and 1 year mark. This gives them enough time to understand what life is like in your community and provide examples of why other residents and families & friends of residents should consider your community for their loved ones.\n\nWhere is my Review Score published?\n\nYour Review Score will be published on aplaceformom.com on your organization’s provider page, destination pages, SLA community search pages, and your community page. The higher your score, the higher you will rank for families as they search.",

As the largest senior living referral information service in the United States, A Place for Mom has guided thousands of families through the process of finding senior care.  Using its nationwide network of more than 18,000 providers of senior living services, the company helps families find care and housing options that meet their needs and empowers them to make informed decisions. \n\nWorking under the principle of delivering individualized, local, expert guidance to families seeking senior care opportunities, A Place for Mom was launched in the summer of 2000.

      "# Post ID 17kp1k8: Warning - A Place For Mom - Vultures who spam you with +139 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-10-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/17kp1k8/warning_a_place_for_mom_vultures_who_spam_you/)\nHi I just want to warn others against contacting A Place For Mom. I did so about six months whole I was just looking to gather information about resources in my area. This company immediately began giving my contact info to every assisted living facility in the region, regardless of whether it was a good fit for my parent or not, and my phone has been ringing off the hook with cold calls ever since. A Place For Mom itself also continues to contact me and harass me, and has ignored all the messages I've sent then asking for it to cease. They've also lied to the Better Business Bureau about taking my name off their list on order to resolve the complaint I made against them for the harassment.\n\nMy aunt had a similar experience with them when looking for a place for my grandpa. She still continues to get calls and emails now years later after my grandpa has passed away. \n\nThere are aging consultant services you can pay for who won't do this sort of thing to you.\n\n## Comment ID k794u0n with +31 score by [(too-much-noise, Reddit, 2023-10-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/17kp1k8/warning_a_place_for_mom_vultures_who_spam_you/k794u0n/) (in reply to ID 17kp1k8):\nThanks for the warning!

I also called around on my own, but they were very helpful in finding places that actually took insurance vs. totally self-pay.  Half of the places I called on my own didn’t even return my call until days or weeks later, and I needed help ASAP because he needed overnight care.  I was really pleased with the service they provided and haven’t had any issues thereafter, so not convinced that they are in the same category as A Place For Mom.\n\n### Comment ID k7bqjqt with +2 score by [(atxJohnR, Reddit, 2023-11-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/17kp1k8/warning_a_place_for_mom_vultures_who_spam_you/k7bqjqt/) (in reply to ID k798z98):\nThey generally charge the place people move into an average of $3500. That $3500 could have been your move in incentive. Nothing is free, and this company is the worst\n\nEdit, APFM Fees range from market to market. The fees are either flat (like $3500), or equivalent to whatever a half, or full month's rent (and care) are for the apartment chosen and care plan monthly rate.\n\n#### Comment ID k7clkhn with +2 score by [(VirginiaUSA1964, Reddit, 2023-11-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/17kp1k8/warning_a_place_for_mom_vultures_who_spam_you/k7clkhn/) (in reply to ID k7bqjqt):\nThat's about right.

If you’re on reddit, you probably don’t need them! Mostly for folks who aren’t good at googling or discovering places nearby. It’s a referral service, so APFM gets commission if someone moves in to a place they recommended. We were told to keep calling until the parent moves. Even if you’re years off from needing a place, they will call and call and call.\n\n### Comment ID kpfrlxy with +4 score by [(bonniebelle8, Reddit, 2024-02-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/17kp1k8/warning_a_place_for_mom_vultures_who_spam_you/kpfrlxy/) (in reply to ID k79jf8q):\nI worked for APFM too.

I ended up using a placement agent recommended by the hospital and he still took us to places where he knew he couldn't get commission but we had no way to say \"but he did the work\".  I thought I was just submitting an initial request for contact to the Web site and they flooded everyone in the area.\n\nIt's a ridiculous system, if they'd given me recommendations and ratings at least there would have been some minor effort.\n\n## Comment ID k7bqd3p with +5 score by [(atxJohnR, Reddit, 2023-11-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/17kp1k8/warning_a_place_for_mom_vultures_who_spam_you/k7bqd3p/) (in reply to ID 17kp1k8):\nCan confirm.

If they find out where she is then they’ll try to collect from that place. It is not a small commission. It’s thousands of dollars for giving you a couple of phone numbers. Happened to me and my Mom. The place I moved her into had to pay it I guess.\n\n## Comment ID k7ayq8n with +3 score by [(RowdyRumRunner, Reddit, 2023-11-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/17kp1k8/warning_a_place_for_mom_vultures_who_spam_you/k7ayq8n/) (in reply to ID 17kp1k8):\nEvery place they recommended was horrible\n\n## Comment ID k7a4y7y with +2 score by [(Lawmonger, Reddit, 2023-10-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/17kp1k8/warning_a_place_for_mom_vultures_who_spam_you/k7a4y7y/) (in reply to ID 17kp1k8):\nI looked into working for them, but after doing some research I stayed away.

I got a recommendation for them when I first got on this board.  They give you limited lists of places then harass you after every visit to see if you're going with them.  The places that use them, usually terribly overpriced, will give them a months rent for referral and not give a break to you.   I told my rep repeatedly I was no longer interested.

I immediately hung up realizing the tech guy had text me his direct phone number and they called me back 7-8 times within an hour. I finally answered and inquired on why they were so relentless and was told that they just want to\nhelp people..  that is overkill and the relentless contact is ruining our reputation.. \n\nI worked in senior living prior to working for a place for mom and the experience in a community setting (skilled nursing and assisted living) makes me have a better understanding of the importance of having a good community that fits someone’s care needs but also their personality. Most of the families I work with do move into the communities I recommend because I put the work in to make sure I am sending them to places they can afford and I know are great places… HOWEVER, most advisors have no prior experience in senior living… most of the new people are sales backgrounds and while my job is technically sales, I don’t like looking at it that way. \n\nHow it works is APFM is paid a referral fee by our community partners. Those communities sign a contract with us and agree to pay a referral fee if a resident we refer moves in, usually the equivalent of one month’s rent. Also, this is how we are free to families. \n\nI’m sorry to hear of all of the negative experiences people have.

Some things I wish I knew about the AL/MC referral system. \n\n- The whole system revolves around referral fees (ie, A Place for Mom is free but they're going to get the community fee you pay or a portion of rent). I talked to a lot of places out of our budget and many folks were like \"Okay. Can I connect you to someone who can help?\". \n- The system so much runs this way that some places you can't even get a hold of without a referral (basically the number listed online will get you no one but A Place for Mom can get you a tour)\n- You loose negotiating power by using referral companies, like if you can connect with a memory care without them you may be able to have your community fee cut in half or even totally dropped. \n- You'll be more likely to get in touch with less corporate feeling, family run places. Some of those I called the number online and got someone pretty quickly.\n- With all this, I'd recommend trying to call some places near you, or trying to drop by, if you can, before dealing with A Place for Mom. I also found a more regional guy who I definitely preferred dealing with to A Place for Mom. APFM know nothing about the places they're recommending beyond cost, and typically know nothing about your area. They still email me to this day, and if my mom ever needs a place I will not be dealing with them again. \n- I hate it so much. I just want to look online and find information and they make it so much more difficult to do that than it should be.\n\n### Comment ID l38ai1u with +2 score by [(meetmypuka, Reddit, 2024-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1cn9jcb/experiences_with_a_place_for_mom/l38ai1u/) (in reply to ID l374qul):\nHear hear!\n\n### Comment ID l3jpbqs with +2 score by [(Glad_Map_520, Reddit, 2024-05-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1cn9jcb/experiences_with_a_place_for_mom/l3jpbqs/) (in reply to ID l374qul):\nI totally understand your POV on all points. \n\nHowever, communities are not allowed by contract to change their fees for APFM referrals.. not saying it doesn’t happen but if it were to, they could get in big trouble for it.. if APFM caught wind of that, I promise they would take action.. that is one thing they will not stand for. \n\nAlso, if you get the right advisor, they will negotiate fees on your behalf. I work for APFM and get community fees waived for my families all the time. I just want my families I work with to find the right fit.. at the end of the day I do have a quota to meet, but I find that I can manage to meet that quota by providing a useful service to the families I work with and help them find a place that fits them well-financially and personality wise.. I definitely hope APFM will take the feedback we get from families and make changes.. we just got a new CEO and she is actually a great person. Hopefully we will see some changes for the good soon-we aren’t all bad! I promise.

I'm not at all saying all the workers at APFM are bad people or even bad at their jobs. I don't however recommend them as a company. I was surprised by how predatory I found the senior care referral industry entirely. First, they hardly saved me time. If it was actually possible to get in touch with communities reasonably easily I'd far prefer to contact them myself. APFM didn't have answers to most of my questions about a place so once I was actually connected with someone I'd still have to have a long conversation asking a bunch of questions. I would lose bargaining power simply for referrers being able to easily reach someone while I as a consumer couldn't. I even said something about trying to get in touch to a place to ask some questions and the woman I was talking to from APFM said \"[it was] because they give us the real numbers\". \n\nMore then one place said they could lower the community fee or not charge it but then saw we were referred for APFM and said they couldn't because of APFM. If you work with APFM and somehow have relationships with the places you're sending folks that's great but I have a hard time believing you could have too close of one since you're dealing with places all over the country. \n\nThe regional guy I worked with was more helpful for us. He had been to several of the places he recommended, he also understood exactly where my mother lives in relation to the places he was suggesting. I'd still recommend folks look on their own if in any position to before using someone. I found referrers were helpful in getting in touch with the more corporate places but family owned places answered their phones generally and returned calls quickly.\n\n## Comment ID l389i31 with +3 score by [(meetmypuka, Reddit, 2024-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1cn9jcb/experiences_with_a_place_for_mom/l389i31/) (in reply to ID 1cn9jcb):\nTerrible terrible terrible!

They don't tell you that your first months rest + level of care + community fee to whatever care facility you choose goes directly to them. So if you mom or dad is a high level of care and the first months rent is like 9k it goes to that advisor that swooped in and got your information.

This service is an absolute waste of money and time.\n\nTheir promises are nothing but empty words. They assured me they would find a placement under $3,200 per month or refund the intake fee. Not only did they fail to deliver, but the only placement they found would have discontinued my mother's dialysis care within two weeks, effectively ending her life. When they couldn't find anything suitable, they backtracked on their refund promise, claiming that a location two hours away somehow fulfilled their commitment—despite it being completely impractical for us.\n\n'A Place for Mom' does nothing more than provide outdated, generic email lists that you could find yourself through a basic internet search. They have ZERO personal knowledge of the facilities they recommend, and multiple communities told me they were worthless and wished more people knew. You end up doing all the work to vet these places yourself while they continuously bombard you with calls, texts, and emails to squeeze money out of your situation. I ultimately found a far better non-profit in Atlanta that genuinely helped me find the right fit for my mom. Don't waste your time, money, or energy on these crooks.\n\n## Comment ID ll8gpi1 with +1 score by [(Flat-Yard-8069, Reddit, 2024-09-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1cn9jcb/experiences_with_a_place_for_mom/ll8gpi1/) (in reply to ID 1cn9jcb):\nIt isn't so bad that they highjack your attempts to contact a facility or that they bombard you with phone calls, never to end, but...........when they outsource their call screening to a non-english speaking  source whom you can barely understand, that's all.

Especially when more and more emergencies happen (because that’s what happens.)\n\nThe continuum of care means that it’s available when they need it (because that’s what happens) and it’s way better for them to be in the same place so that it’s not as foreign to them. Their friends can still visit and sometimes the facility will discount their room if they ever need to go to the nursing section for rehab. \n\nDon’t use A Place for Mom, just pull up your location on google maps and do a search for facilities near you.

Better to ask friends and neighbors whose elderly relatives have already moved and have passed the initial adjustment period. If your in-laws are church members seek guidance from the clergyman and other families. Any place that you consider be sure to visit several times if possible.\n\nI strongly recommend consulting with an elder law attorney in the area to review any contracts. Many places increase the monthly fee as the resident’s needs increase.  I would look for a place associated with a non profit.  Don’t be impressed by the decor in the lobby. If someone needs assisted living it means that their care will most likely be provided by a poorly paid, overworked person with too many other residents that they have to assist. \n\nHave you tried home care or adult day programs?\n\n### Comment ID ihlh7vf with +1 score by [(readzalot1, Reddit, 2022-07-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/w76s5i/a_place_for_mom/ihlh7vf/) (in reply to ID ihibo3d):\nI agree that asking around is really useful.

A hospital social worker put them in contact with me when I was looking into whether or not there were any facilities that could take my dad with multiple forms of dementia. (the social worker was of no help at all with anything concerning my dad)  I had no idea that was actually who they were sending me to until a Senior Living Consultant from there contacted me. She of course recommended the communities that advertised with them and they were extremely expensive and all private pay. That part of the conversation was a waste of time and I let her know that we couldn't afford anything she was mentioning.  \n\n\nBut the lady I spoke with used to be a social worker and she was able to give me lots of other information about how to apply for certain benefits etc. My dad was in the service so she sent me links to things that could possibly help with veterans. She sent me a lot of other helpful links too about how to apply for medicaid etc. I realize all of that information is online but I was in a crisis situation and totally overwhelmed with trying to figure out what to do. Ultimately the information and resources she provided me with didn't turn out to be helpful for us but she was very kind and it was a good starting point to get some conversations going with my mother. We ultimately got help way past the crisis point by a social worker once my dad started getting services from hospice.  \n\n\nBasically the service itself wasn't helpful but I talked to a really nice lady that helped me in a really bad time!",

PLEASE do not use them-they’re predatory, do not care about you or your loved one and will sell your loved ones information to every marketing firm they can think of. They only work with communities who pay for their referrals and, as others have said, high quality communities don’t have to pay for referrals. The “counselors” will send your loved ones information to every community they contract with in your general area, they do nothing to actually determine what is best for your loved one, they just want the money for the placement contract. If you are looking for care please check the Nursing Home Compare site on Medicare.gov or speak with the long term care ombudsman in your area. Google is also your friend, read reviews, take tours (most communities are happy to accommodate a virtual tour if needed), talk to others who have had to move their loved one into care, or look for local placement services (they’re smaller and tend to be actually client focused).

I am a former senior advisor for a similar company. And we did things very differently. \n\nAPFM will hire any warm body that will work under their pressure.  I remember a time where you had to have experience to be an advisor for APFM. That stopped years ago.\n\n\nI have 16 years in the industry and spent most of that time in the dementia field.\nI truly “advised” and coached my families through the process because the industry is confusing. I was honest and taught them how to do their due diligence when vetting a community. After all, in most cases they were choosing their loved ones last home. Kind of a big deal. If they had an interest in a community we did NOT partner with, I still reached out and collected that info or set a tour there if the family wanted it. I know that isn’t the norm in this business. But I would appreciate it if the show was on the other foot.\n\nSenior living is big business and unfortunately that’s most businesses these days.\n\nAnd one fallacy I saw posted here by another user I want to clear up. APFM isn’t just used by bad communities that need heads in beds. Pretty much all your major senior living players use referral agencies and so do the lesser known communities to capture online business. This is and has been the model for sometime. The only exceptions tend to be CCRC communities and non profit or religious affiliated communities.

Mom would have needed memory care if dad died, but with him as an anchor she did fine in the ALF.  However, with lingering problems from the broken hip and extremely poor compliance with rehab, I don't see her ever getting back to the ALF, which has told me they \"generally won't take anyone that isn't at least 50% weight bearing.\"  I'm doubtful she will ever get back to that, and the ALF director (a very good guy) told me (with all kinds of caveats) that he is skeptical she will be able to come back.  The nursing home is using a slide board, which the ALF theoretically can use, but they seem reluctant to take someone back that may need that for a long time, or forever.  To make matters more complicated, dad categorically refuses to move out of the area, which is now prone to terrible traffic.  It often takes him 45 minutes to the nursing home mom is rehabbing in, so staying there long term is not a solution.  Its also not a great place, especially nights and weekends.  My dad would not meet the requirements to live in a nursing home without insurance fraud, and he'd probably go nuts with her in one of those tiny rooms.  At least in the ALF, he could get some space every now and then.  So the best situation would either be a facility with both a nursing home and an ALF, or two independent facilities very close together.  \n\n**The Need:**  Its sufficiently complicated and I'm sufficiently far away that I'm thinking if there is quality professional help out there, that would be great.  Anyone have positive or negative experiences with the various services?\n\n## Comment ID iuo4kdh with +11 score by [(SandhillCrane5, Reddit, 2022-11-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/yjbylo/thoughtsrecommendations_for_senior_placement/iuo4kdh/) (in reply to ID yjbylo):\nYou'd be better off hiring a private Geriatric Care Manager to help you find an appropriate place rather than severely limiting your options to facilities that need to pay a service for referrals.

My mom died 1.5 years ago and my dad has aged so quickly since then. He still wants to live in their house and refuses to move to an independent living facility and I’m pretty sure he’s decided to just die there, which is anxiety producing for his children. We have the “time to consider moving” conversation on a regular basis. I live 15 minutes away from him, my sister is an hour away. It would be very hard to imagine him staying in his house without us nearby (but we are not always able to help when he needs it either).

They will know the communities so well, and a good one will hold your hand through the finding process and make a good match. Their reputation will depend on good matches. It’s a free service to you, they’re paid by the community if an individual moves in. You can find one by calling an assisted living home and asking if they can refer you to a referral agent. Let them know you have a complicated situation and need some assistance. Good luck!",

Hope to visit and walk the city, particularly the SE, in the nest 1-2 years. \n\nHowever, (because feeling a little defensive) the Northern California Bay Area is not as bad as the news might lead you to believe. Our forecast high today is 63 and highest over the next 10 days is 69. Air qualify at 18 is good.  July memories with kids include taking the ferry home from work, then zipping up their jackets before going for a walk to the playground. They loved summer school in July at UC Berkeley, first at Lawrence Hall of Science and later on campus classes for kids. Season tickets for kids at the San Francisco Symphony with events like Robin Williams narrating Peter and the Wolf. MIL was in a nearby nursing home just one block from a beach walkway, easily pushing her wheelchair. \n\nNow retired, we regularly take the ferry to SF to walk places like Chinatown, Fishermans Wharf etc, or drive to Fort Point and walk the Presidio/GG bridge/Palace of Fine Arts area, or drive to Fort Funston to hike, beach walk and watch the hang gliders because, in spite of the news, 99% of SF is clean and beautiful. Or even closer head to Redwood Regional Park in much maligned Oakland to hike in an absolutely gorgeous redwood forest. Or slightly longer drive to Marin County to hike Point Reyes National Seashore/Mount Tamalpais/Muir Woods areas. \n\nTo get a sense of how good the hiking - and related beauty - is in the Bay Area, there are over 1,000 trails [rated 4.5+ out of 5 on AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/us/california/san-francisco?b_tl_lat=38.12371479010139&b_tl_lng=-122.900391756588&b_br_lat=37.34115558502704&b_br_lng=-121.80564479624533&mobileMap=true&rating_min=4.5) within a 25 mile radius of SF.  \n\nWithin 25 miles the following are part of the National Park Service: San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park, Presidio of San Francisco, Fort Point National Historic Site, Rosie the Riveter WWII Home Front National Historical Park, Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial (*in recent news*), Point Reyes National Seashore, Fort Funston, Muir Woods National Monument, Alcatraz island, Eugene O'Neil National Historic Site, John Muir National Historic Site (his home in the east bay, not the woods).\n\n#### Comment ID lfekwyq with +1 score by [(Cold-Ad-7144, Reddit, 2024-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/grandrapids/comments/1eczuml/85_yr_old_mil_done_with_ca_fires_is_considering/lfekwyq/) (in reply to ID lf82gv2):\nI lived in SF for 11 years and also near Lake Tahoe.

They’re a for profit referral service that does absolutely nothing themselves. And apparently they get paid per contact they make because this mother and son (their claim) wouldn’t stop calling me. Even after blocking their numbers they continued calling me on new numbers. And going by my caller ID, the same pair also work for Visiting Angels, Aging Care and a few other names that you’ll see pop up as sponsored sites when you google help for aging parents. I just want to warn as many people as I can about these scammers. It’s been over a year since I first gave them my number and I cannot get rid of them. If you want to find out for yourself, try filling out their form without giving them a phone number, or only giving them a landline number. If you get a message that a cell phone number is required information or not optional - you can be sure someone is attempting to get your number for the purpose of giving it to salesmen. Or selling it to other sites. Try that little test and save yourself a lot of grief.",

There are also 1 bedroom/living area/bathroom as well. The monthly fee Included all meals, snack areas, weekly housekeeping. There are staff on site 24 hrs and if additional services required, then additional fees of course as that unfortunately is the retirement home model. It is an older building, used to be the original Parkwood Hospital. Had a positive vibe when touring facilities for an older friend last year. Used to work in the LTC sector so have a very critical eye. \nIf a person is eligible, home care can come into a retirement home to help provide services too. \nGood luck!\n\n## Comment ID lu7mbnx with +1 score by [(RichardGrim, Reddit, 2024-10-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/londonontario/comments/1f447ts/retirement_facilities_in_town_that_arent/lu7mbnx/) (in reply to ID 1f447ts):\nHi OP, I would recommend you to take a look at Seasons Retirement Communities. As far as I know, they have a location in London, Ontario. They offer a wide range of lifestyle options and different levels of care. It could be a realistic option to look into if you’re hoping for quality care within your budget. Here’s where you can visit [their website](https://seasonsretirement.com/locations/seasons-london/) to learn more about them and their services.

My mom has dementia, he has done no planning for her.\nI live in another state as my parents moved to Georgia for reasons. The hospital my mom was in for the flu ( they both got the flu) is trying to discharge my mom and I’m fighting it tooth and nail as she can’t be in the apartment by herself and the apartment is gross. My mom has Kaiser Medicare. I’ve tried getting what I can together to get her on Medicaid but my aunt doesn’t think she’ll be eligible. I can’t stay longer as I can’t afford to go on fmla and not be paid. I’m crashing, I’m crying non stop, I’ve tried to be strong but mentally I’m done. I don’t know what to do.

Keep repeating “unsafe discharge”. And do not take her out of the hospital. The social worker will figure out something. \n\nI’m so sorry you’re going through this OP. It’s awful when you find yourself having to navigate this nightmare. \n\nI was fortunate that the hospital decided on their own that my mom was an unsafe discharge and the social worker found her a place within a day, during the middle of the pandemic. It may take a bit to get sorted and if she is on Medicare (someone correct me if I’m wrong) I believe they will cover the first 60 days of nursing home care on a hospital discharge. That gives you some breathing room to figure out the rest.\n\n#### Comment ID maf6t9y with +7 score by [(wontbeafool2, Reddit, 2025-02-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1if4iwx/dad_left_me_with_a_mess_and_im_out_of_time_and/maf6t9y/) (in reply to ID maddis5):\nSame here.

None of that is \"covered\", either. The costs vary a lot. In my area, most won't accept a new admission without having $200,000 in the bank to cover around two years of care. Do you have access to their finances? As someone mentioned, speak with the social worker at the hospital about her condition and her financial situation to get advice. Medicaid may be an option, depending on her finances. If she qualifies for Medicaid, then you need to find a place that accepts Medicaid patients.  Depending on her condition, you could also consider her living with you and bringing in help, while you are at work. It may be cheaper....\n\nStates also have organizations to help navigate options. In my state it's the National Aging and Disability Resource Center Program (ADRC). Each county has an office. They can help/council with a lot of decisions. [https://acl.gov/programs/aging-and-disability-networks/aging-and-disability-resource-centers](https://acl.gov/programs/aging-and-disability-networks/aging-and-disability-resource-centers)\n\nOn finding facilities, you can get help with placement options through an organization called \"A place for Mom\" - they know what is available in your area and have info that may make choices easier.  They don't charge anything .  [https://www.aplaceformom.com/eldercare-advisors](https://www.aplaceformom.com/eldercare-advisors)\n\nGod bless.

          "cons": "It's disheartening to recount my experience at A Place for Mom, which was marred by consistent mistreatment and disregard for employees' well-being. The Chief Sales Officer's blatant disregard for staff welfare, prioritizing customer satisfaction over employee morale, flies in the face of the company's purported values. Despite the founders' efforts to instill a positive culture, it's evident that employees are viewed as expendable assets rather than valued contributors.Human Resources fails miserably in its role as a safeguard against mistreatment, rendering it ineffective for protecting employees from verbal abuse and poor treatment. The appalling behavior exhibited by upper management on national calls, resorting to derogatory language and insults towards the team, is utterly unacceptable for any professional setting.While the company boasts about its training programs, the reality falls short, with incomplete and ineffective execution. The President's incompetence, demonstrated by an inability to operate basic tools like PowerPoint, further undermines confidence in leadership during town hall meetings.Lamentably, A Place for Mom lacks coherent direction and fails to execute effectively. Micromanagement tactics are wielded as instruments of intimidation, with every call monitored and management fostering a culture of fear rather than motivation. The abundance of purportedly \"5-star\" reviews reeks of manipulation by upper management to maintain inflated ratings.Despite lip service paid to teamwork and collaboration, the reality is starkly different. From top to bottom, the company is rife with dysfunction, making it unthinkable to recommend their services to anyone. A Place for Mom is a far cry from its advertised image, and I would caution against entrusting the care of loved ones to such an organization.",

Hitting 50% sounds easy until you see how many people actually can do that. \n\nOld school/closed minded company - they warn you of this before you start but there’s absolutely no wiggle room; you must work holidays/nights/weekends/end of month. For being called a place for mom, they sure don’t care out their employees or their employees families. It is business first - always! \n\nMicromanagement at all levels - I was an RM &amp; I was micromanaged to micromanage my SLA team. That type of fear leadership doesn't help anyone. I couldn’t even set clear expectations with my team because the expectations changed nearly everyday. The extreme whiplash created a toxic environment for all.",

Their quotas are extremely high and unattainable, their staff turnover rates are incredibly high too. Lead quality is terrible, most people who are calling in are Medicaid leads and APFM does not support people who are not private pay. \n\nAPFM preys upon vulnerable elderly people. I felt very morally conflicted here and the leaders at this company simply don’t have a conscience. They want you to use hard sales tactics on these families and senior citizens and harass them frequently. The standard of living in most of these communities that APFM is partnered with is very very poor. \n\nThere are metrics for your every move in the role, be prepared to be micromanaged every step of the way. 50 dial minimum per day, referral rates are tracked, you must book a tour on every call, those numbers are tracked. \n\nYou can make good money with your commission if you’re able to get to quota. The thing is, is that they intentionally make it impossible to get to goal, so you’re never able to make that extra money. You don’t get paid any commission until you’re over 50% to your quota, so be prepared to only be paid your base pay. \n\nI went into the role very optimistic and have given it my all. You’re in a group of about 30 people for training initially, every person I was in training with, is no longer with the company. I’ve managed to hang in there but as you can see, I’m looking for other opportunities. It’s probably the most stressful role I’ve ever had as they do threaten job security if you aren’t making quota. \n\nThey also offer a sign on bonus, but if you leave the company for the 1 year make, they’ll make you pay it back. \n\nI would highly recommend seeking employment elsewhere.",

The Chief Sales Officer's blatant disregard for staff welfare, prioritizing customer satisfaction over employee morale, flies in the face of the company's purported values. Despite the founders' efforts to instill a positive culture, it's evident that employees are viewed as expendable assets rather than valued contributors.Human Resources fails miserably in its role as a safeguard against mistreatment, rendering it ineffective for protecting employees from verbal abuse and poor treatment. The appalling behavior exhibited by upper management on national calls, resorting to derogatory language and insults towards the team, is utterly unacceptable for any professional setting.While the company boasts about its training programs, the reality falls short, with incomplete and ineffective execution. The President's incompetence, demonstrated by an inability to operate basic tools like PowerPoint, further undermines confidence in leadership during town hall meetings.Lamentably, A Place for Mom lacks coherent direction and fails to execute effectively. Micromanagement tactics are wielded as instruments of intimidation, with every call monitored and management fostering a culture of fear rather than motivation. The abundance of purportedly \"5-star\" reviews reeks of manipulation by upper management to maintain inflated ratings.Despite lip service paid to teamwork and collaboration, the reality is starkly different. From top to bottom, the company is rife with dysfunction, making it unthinkable to recommend their services to anyone. A Place for Mom is a far cry from its advertised image, and I would caution against entrusting the care of loved ones to such an organization.",

Their quotas are extremely high and unattainable, their staff turnover rates are incredibly high too. Lead quality is terrible, most people who are calling in are Medicaid leads and APFM does not support people who are not private pay. \n\nAPFM preys upon vulnerable elderly people. I felt very morally conflicted here and the leaders at this company simply don’t have a conscience. They want you to use hard sales tactics on these families and senior citizens and harass them frequently. The standard of living in most of these communities that APFM is partnered with is very very poor. \n\nThere are metrics for your every move in the role, be prepared to be micromanaged every step of the way. 50 dial minimum per day, referral rates are tracked, you must book a tour on every call, those numbers are tracked. \n\nYou can make good money with your commission if you’re able to get to quota. The thing is, is that they intentionally make it impossible to get to goal, so you’re never able to make that extra money. You don’t get paid any commission until you’re over 50% to your quota, so be prepared to only be paid your base pay. \n\nI went into the role very optimistic and have given it my all. You’re in a group of about 30 people for training initially, every person I was in training with, is no longer with the company. I’ve managed to hang in there but as you can see, I’m looking for other opportunities. It’s probably the most stressful role I’ve ever had as they do threaten job security if you aren’t making quota. \n\nThey also offer a sign on bonus, but if you leave the company for the 1 year make, they’ll make you pay it back. \n\nI would highly recommend seeking employment elsewhere.",

      "# [Senate probes A Place for Mom, referral service accused of putting seniors at risk by Tyler Kingkade on 2024-06-18](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/senate-announces-probe-place-for-mom-referral-service-rcna157282)\nThe Senate Special Committee on Aging is launching an investigation into A Place for Mom, the country’s largest for-profit senior care referral service, which has been accused of steering people toward facilities with documented safety and regulatory violations while collecting lucrative commissions.\n\nCommittee Chair Bob Casey, D-Pa., sent a letter Tuesday to A Place for Mom accusing it of misleading users about the role commissions play in its referrals and discriminating against low-income families. The letter, obtained by NBC News, requested three years’ worth of information about revenue the company has received from assisted living communities.\n\nA Place for Mom, launched in 2000, which bills itself as the biggest online referral service for senior living options, lists roughly 14,000 establishments in the U.S. and accepts payments from those facilities. But seniors and their families might not realize that’s less than half of the facilities on the market, the letter states.\n\nCasey’s letter also criticizes A Place for Mom for encouraging families to spend more than they can afford. It cites a frequently asked questions section of the company’s website that encourages facilities not to worry if they charge more than a family’s stated upper limit. According to the FAQ, nearly 40% of families who moved to senior living paid roughly $1,000 more per month than they had budgeted.\n\n“It is clear A Place for Mom is upselling families, and the company ultimately benefits from families spending beyond their means,” Casey wrote.\n\nThe FAQ also says its advisers do their best “to ensure that no federally funded family is referred” to the communities, effectively barring families who want to use Medicaid funding to cover assisted living costs.A Place for Mom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAssisted living and elder care are part of a booming industry that’s expected to continue expanding in the next two decades. The average monthly cost of assisted living is around $4,500 to $5,300, but it varies depending on location and the level of care required. A majority of the facilities are affiliated with chains or large corporations, and the quality of care has increasingly been called into question as private equity firms have taken greater ownership of the industry.\n\nIn 2010, The Seattle Times reported that A Place for Mom referred people to senior living homes without inspecting them for quality or safety, directing families toward facilities with documented abuse and neglect violations. The company said at the time that its advisers sometimes fall behind on visiting facilities in person but that many families were satisfied with its services.\n\nThis year, a Washington Post analysis found that more than a third of the facilities the website recommended as “Best of Senior Living” across 28 states had been “cited for neglect or substandard care in the past two years.” State oversight records reviewed by the Post alleged the facilities failed to properly tend to injuries, mismanaged medication and did not adequately monitor patients who later died. The company told the Post it encourages families to do their own research to make “an informed decision.”\n\nWhile A Place for Mom is the biggest senior living referral service, it is not the only website that receives commissions from facilities for finding them residents.\n\nKate Granigan, board president of the Aging Life Care Association, a nonprofit group that advocates for ethical standards in elder care, said that as long as the facilities foot the bill for referrals — rather than the consumers’ paying advisers for recommendations — the model is “ripe for conflict.” She said she would support legislation to require minimum transparency standards for referral services.\n\n“Transparency about how they get paid is important to the consumer. “As is the fact that they don’t represent everything that’s out there — they represent who pays them. I also think there should be transparency about their expertise,” Granigan said, noting that consumers may not understand that not all of the advisers who help them have medical backgrounds.\n\nA Place for Mom was previously owned by a private equity firm that simultaneously had invested in assisted living facilities, before the website was sold to the two other private equity firms that currently hold it, according to Casey’s letter.\n\nCasey’s letter asked A Place for Mom for its total revenue for each of the last three years and for the 100 facilities it received the most money from and referred the most people to over the same period. The letter also requested details on A Place for Mom's process for vetting facilities and the total number of move-in fees it received last year, along with copies of sample contracts. The company has until July 15 to provide the requested information.",
      "# [The 7 Stages of Dementia by Leah Hallstrom on 2024-05-28](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/dementia-stages)\nKey Takeaways\n\nThere are seven stages of dementia, each with distinct symptoms. The stages are broken down into three phases of pre-, middle-, and late-stage dementia.\n\nDementia typically isn’t diagnosed until stage 4. Dementia stages 1, 2, and 3 are classified as pre-dementia stages, as symptoms aren’t yet severe enough for a diagnosis.\n\nThere’s no set timeline for how long each stage will last. Understanding the symptoms associated with each stage will help you monitor your loved one as the disease progresses.\n\nMemory care communities can help. Explore how thoughtfully designed memory care communities can support your loved one at any stage.\n\nWhat are the seven stages of dementia?\n\nHealth care providers use a comprehensive tool to assess the seven stages of dementia in the elderly called the Global Deterioration Scale.[01] Also known as the GDS, this trusted method enables caregivers and health professionals to determine how quickly dementia is progressing in an elderly patient. It also helps families and care providers know which symptoms to expect during each of the seven stages of dementia.\n\nLearning about the dementia stages can help caregivers track and monitor stage-related symptoms to identify a loved one’s brain-health status.\n\nThe seven stages of dementia include:\n\nStage 1: no cognitive impairment\n\nStage 2: very mild cognitive decline\n\nStage 3: mild cognitive decline\n\nStage 4: moderate cognitive decline\n\nStage 5: moderately severe cognitive decline\n\nStage 6: severe cognitive decline\n\nStage 7: very severe cognitive decline\n\nHow does dementia progress?\n\nThe seven stages are separated into three progressive phases or levels of dementia:\n\nPre-dementia or early-stage dementia (stages 1, 2, and 3). In this initial phase, a person can still live independently and may not exhibit obvious memory loss or have any difficulty completing regular tasks. Mild dementia symptoms mimic episodes of age-related forgetfulness.\n\nModerate or middle-stage dementia (stages 4 and 5). Moderate dementia symptoms significantly affect a person’s personality and behavior. Someone with middle-stage dementia will generally need full- or part-time caregiver assistance with regular day-to-day activities. Moderate-stage dementia symptoms include significant cognitive impairment and mood swings.\n\nSevere or late-stage dementia (stages 6 and 7). These final phases are associated with severe cognitive impairment along with a loss of physical abilities. Late dementia symptoms can include pronounced memory loss, incontinence, and an inability to move without help.\n\nSpecific types of dementias — including Alzheimer’s, vascular, Lewy body, and frontotemporal dementia — advance at unique rates and differ from person to person. Therefore, it’s important to understand the signs and symptoms at each stage so you can quickly identify whether your loved one’s dementia has progressed. Read on for a look at the symptoms related to each stage.\n\nDementia stage 1: No cognitive impairment\n\nThough it may sound odd, stage 1 dementia often looks like normal mental functioning without any cognitive decline. Someone in the first three stages of dementia doesn’t usually exhibit enough symptoms to be diagnosed.\n\nWhile mild cognitive impairment may be present, stages 1, 2, and 3 on the GDS are recognized as pre-dementia stages. However, it’s important to note that changes in the brain are still taking place in these early stages, which could eventually lead to a dementia diagnosis at stage 4.\n\nLet our care assessment guide you\n\nOur free tool provides options, advice, and next steps based on your unique situation.\n\nDementia stage 2: Very mild cognitive decline\n\nStage 2 dementia includes simple memory mistakes like a loved one wondering, “Where did I put my keys?” or “What was that person’s name?” This is a pre-dementia stage and does not yet warrant an official dementia diagnosis.\n\nA significant portion of the senior population experiences age-related forgetfulness, and caregivers or medical providers may not even notice such a mild impairment. This explains why stage 2 is also known as “age-associated memory impairment” on the GDS, meaning many older adults will experience symptoms like these at some point during aging.\n\n“About 40% of people aged 65 or older have age-associated memory impairment — in the United States, about 16 million people,” said Professor Gary W. Small in research published by the British Medical Association.[02] “Only about 1% of them will progress to dementia each year.”\n\nThis means that for many people, pre-dementia stage 2 does not progress to an official dementia diagnosis. Seniors can maintain at this stage for a long time or indefinitely with the right lifestyle changes that support their brain health.\n\nStage 2 dementia symptoms include:\n\nLosing track of familiar objects\n\nInability to recall names of friends, family members, and former acquaintances\n\nTalk with a Senior Living Advisor\n\nOur advisors help 300,000 families each year find the right senior care for their loved ones.\n\nDementia stage 3: Mild cognitive decline\n\nStage 3 dementia is also known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or decline. It doesn’t generally have a major effect on day-to-day functioning and may not yet result in an official dementia diagnosis. Memory and cognitive problems may become more regular and noticeable to caregivers and family members.\n\nHow quickly can this early dementia stage progress to a dementia diagnosis in the elderly?\n\nAn estimated 10 to 20 percent of people age 65 or older with MCI will develop recognizable or diagnosable dementia within a year, according to the National Institute on Aging.[03]\n\nSince MCI can precede more severe dementia, it’s important to recognize these stage 3 signs, and seek medical advice to support your brain health and keep the dementia from progressing.\n\nStage 3 dementia symptoms include:\n\nOften forgetting to go to appointments or events\n\nLosing things often\n\nGetting lost while traveling\n\nDecreased work performance\n\nDifficulty finding the right words\n\nVerbal repetition\n\nChallenges with organization and concentration\n\nTrouble with complex tasks and problem-solving\n\nProblems with driving\n\nDementia stage 4: Moderate cognitive decline\n\nStage 4 dementia is when a person has clear, visible signs of cognitive impairment and also exhibits personality changes, with significant dementia behaviors and severe stage 3 symptoms. A person is not typically diagnosed with dementia until they’re at stage 4 or beyond.\n\nWhile the medical terminology for stage 4 dementia is moderate cognitive decline, this stage is officially diagnosed by the GDS as “mild dementia.” At this stage, doctors and caregivers will likely observe hallmark signs that dementia is getting worse, including difficulties with language and reduced problem-solving skills.\n\nStage 4 dementia symptoms include:\n\nSocial withdrawal\n\nEmotional moodiness\n\nLack of responsiveness\n\nReduced intellectual sharpness\n\nTrouble with routine tasks\n\nForgetting recent events\n\nDenial of symptoms\n\nDementia stage 5: Moderately severe cognitive decline\n\nThis stage marks the onset of what many professionals refer to as middle-stage dementia or “mid-stage” in the seven stages of dementia. At this point, a person may no longer be able to carry out normal activities of daily living (ADLs), such as dressing or bathing, or instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) without some caregiver assistance.\n\nStage 5 often lasts between two and four years, though every dementia patient will progress at a unique rate.[04]\n\nIn stage 5 dementia, your loved one will likely require more intense support and supervision. They know major facts about themselves — such as their name and their children’s names — but they may not remember their grandchildren’s names, their longtime address, or where they went to high school.\n\nStage 5 dementia symptoms include:\n\nPronounced memory loss, including personal details and current events\n\nWandering\n\nConfusion and forgetfulness\n\nDisorientation and sundown syndrome\n\nFurther reduced mental acuity and problem-solving ability\n\nDementia stage 6: Severe cognitive decline\n\nStage 6 dementia marks a need for caregiver help to perform basic daily activities, such as eating, using the toilet, and other self-care. Seniors experiencing this stage of moderately severe dementia may have difficulty regulating sleep, interacting with others, or behaving appropriately in public settings.\n\nAt stage 6 of dementia, you may find yourself wondering if full-time care is necessary as symptoms become more complex. You can stay prepared by tracking symptoms, monitoring your loved one’s ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), and exploring care options like memory care or home care.\n\nStage 6 dementia symptoms include:\n\nSleep difficulties\n\nUrinary or fecal incontinence\n\nAggression and anxiety\n\nPersonality changes including paranoia or delusions\n\nInability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs)\n\nPronounced memory loss\n\nInability to recognize loved ones and caregivers\n\nDementia stage 7: Very severe cognitive decline\n\nIn stage 7, which is considered end-stage dementia, people can no longer care for themselves and are barely responsive as their verbal and physical capacities shut down. All verbal ability is lost, movement becomes severely impaired, and bodily organs begin to fail.\n\nStage 7 dementia symptoms include:\n\nInability to speak\n\nInability to remember loved ones or caregivers\n\nLack of physical ability to move without help\n\nInability to chew or swallow\n\nImpaired bodily functions, including breathing, and organ failure\n\nSleeping a lot\n\nUrinary and fecal incontinence\n\nHow long does this aggressive end stage of dementia last?\n\nThe final stage of dementia can typically last one to three years, but it’s difficult to predict since everyone is different.[05]\n\nHow fast does dementia progress?\n\nThere’s no way to predict how long it will take for a loved one to progress through all the stages of dementia. Lifestyle factors can make a big difference in how fast dementia will progress, like diet and exercise.\n\nDementia gets worse with time, but some people stay in the early stages of dementia longer and can remain independent for many years. Others may experience rapid dementia progression and will require more immediate support. Once a person reaches the final, most aggressive stage of dementia, they typically only have a couple years left.[05]\n\nHow long do people live with dementia?\n\nHow to care for a loved one with dementia\n\nCaregivers have a variety of ways to provide support to a loved one through the progression of dementia:\n\nTry to have positive and meaningful conversations using effective dementia communication strategies.\n\nConsider exploring unique dementia treatment options and therapies.\n\nCreate a dementia care plan.\n\nConsider joining a support group for caregivers.\n\nLearn about dementia care techniques for caregivers.\n\nFind memory care options in your area.\n\nComing to accept a loved one’s dementia diagnosis, and understanding what to expect, can help you feel empowered and provide opportunities to make the most of this time together.\n\nIf the idea of navigating a dementia diagnosis alone seems overwhelming, A Place for Mom is here for you. Explore our library of caregiver resources, which contains hundreds of articles covering dementia therapies and information on memory care communities.\n\nMemory care options\n\nMemory care is specialized support for seniors with a dementia diagnosis. These communities provide 24-hour supervision by trained memory care caregivers to reduce anxiety, assist with ADLs, and prevent accidents caused by wandering.\n\nMemory care communities also provide comfortable and thoughtfully designed living arrangements, meal services, and trained on-site nurses ready administer health care as needed. Therapeutic on-site memory care activities, dining plans, and exercise programs (for both mind and body) address all types of dementia symptoms. Whether through in-home care or at a community, specialized memory care can be beneficial from the early stages of dementia through the end of life.\n\nUnderstanding when to seek memory care will vary depending on a senior’s dementia symptoms, health status, living situation, and more. Our Senior Living Advisors offer free guidance and are ready to discuss local memory care communities or dementia home care options with your family, tailored to your budget and individualized needs.",
      "# [Washington Post Analysis Links A Place for Mom Reviews, Awards with Care Citations by Austin Montgomery, www.facebook.com, ausitn.montgomery on 2024-05-16](https://seniorhousingnews.com/2024/05/16/washington-post-analysis-links-a-place-for-mom-reviews-awards-with-care-citations/)\nAn analysis by the Washington Post has found that roughly 37% of senior living properties recognized by the A Place for Mom referral service in 2023 and this year as award-winning communities were cited for “serious violations affecting resident care.”\n\nA Place for Mom had awarded the communities as “Best of Senior Living” properties on its referral lists in the past to years despite “many citations from state inspectors,” the Washington Post article states.\n\nThe Post cataloged APFM’s “best of” award in 2023 and 2024, looking up inspection and violation reports for 863 senior living communities in 28 states, of which 37.5% of the “Best of Senior Living” communities were found to have had state-level violations that impacted resident care.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose violations spanned falls, bed sores, medication errors, call response issues, failure to bathe or groom residents, understaffing, sub-standard training, along with violence and sexual abuse, the Post article notes.\n\nThe recent Post analysis comes as more families and prospective residents search online to get information regarding local senior living options near them, and shape their decisions going forward.\n\n“A Place for Mom is proud to serve as an important resource to family caregivers,” the company said in an emailed statement to SHN. “Our national team of senior living advisors help to simplify a complex process, speaking with over 700K families every year. We are dedicated to our mission, providing access to transparent information, tools, and resources to help families make informed and confident senior care decisions.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo reach APFM’s “best of” list, senior living providers need recent reviews with an average of 4.5 stars, according to the APFM website.\n\nIn explaining how APFM interfaces with operators citing bankruptcy court documents, the Post notes that senior living providers pay APFM “a fee equal to about a month’s fees for a successful placement” of a new senior living resident.\n\nFounded in 2000, APFM is now owned by Silver Lake Partners and General Atlantic, two private equity companies, and is the largest referral service in the industry.\n\nBut, the Post found, the APFM model creates incentives for senior living providers to influence or even “manipulate” their online reviews; the newspaper spoke with some former senior living professionals who described practices such as soliciting reviews selectively only from people having positive experiences, and staff being expected to meet review “quotas” so that positive reviews would outweigh negative ones.\n\n“Those reviews do not come by in a way that really give an accurate understanding of the culture of the community,” one former executive director told the Post.\n\nIn March, APFM cut its customer success team in favor of a new way of directly working with operators, as previously reported by SHN. In April, APFM CEO Larry Kutscher stepped down, with President Tatyana Zlotsky now serving as the company’s leader.",
      "# [Assisted Living vs. Memory Care: 5 Key Differences by Merritt Whitley on 2024-09-20](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/assisted-living-vs-memory-care)\nKey Takeaways\n\nAssisted living provides caregiver assistance that focuses on activities of daily living such as bathing and dressing.\n\nMemory care provides specialized assistance for seniors with dementia that focuses on safety in a specially designed environment.\n\nSome assisted living communities offer memory care on-site, making it easy for seniors to get the care they need without moving.\n\nMemory care costs more than assisted living due to the added care and supervision that residents need.\n\nThe differences between assisted living and memory care\n\nIt’s normal to wonder about your loved one’s care needs, whether they have a dementia diagnosis or you’re simply noticing a change in their cognitive abilities. About 70% of adults older than 65 will need long-term care, and many will have some type of cognitive decline or memory loss.[01]\n\nMaureen Bradley gained valuable experience working in assisted living communities and as a memory care director before joining A Place for Mom. She explains the overlap between assisted living and memory care.\n\n“The average age in assisted living these days is around 85, and that age group makes up nearly three-quarters of the people who have dementia. What this means is that it’s very common for people in assisted living communities to be in the early stages of dementia,” says Bradley.\n\nStill, you’ll want to evaluate both types of senior living communities carefully to make sure your parent’s needs will be met.\n\n1. Safety\n\nGeneral assisted living communities may offer safety features like in-room emergency alert systems and daily check-ins. For seniors with memory loss, increased safety is a major concern, as wandering, aggression, and falls are common and dangerous dementia behaviors.\n\nTo help keep residents safe, memory care-specific communities often have added security features such as:\n\nLocked entrances and exits\n\nKeypad entries\n\nObscured exits\n\nDoorbells that signal entering and exiting\n\nTo reduce anxiety and avoid injuries from falls, facility layouts include design elements that minimize confusion. Plus, memory care communities provide additional calming therapies within soothing spaces. This added level of care is aimed at reducing the agitation and confusion that may lead to aggression or self-injury in persons with dementia.\n\n2. Staff training and care\n\nStaff members at both assisted living and memory care facilities have experience supporting residents with day-to-day tasks. But staff at memory care facilities are specially trained in dementia care and provide supervision to residents around the clock. This helps seniors with dementia maintain cognitive skills, a sense of self, and quality of life for as long as possible.\n\n“Memory care communities tend to have a much higher caregiver-to-resident ratio. This is important because it can take longer to provide ADL care, and people in memory care often need more direct oversight for safety and social engagement,” says Bradley.\n\nCaregivers at memory care facilities are trained to effectively and compassionately prevent and manage difficult dementia behaviors, such as wandering and aggression. They understand the balance of encouraging residents to stay as independent as possible while providing the support they need.\n\nRead more:Person-Centered Care and Its Role In Assisted Living: A Guide\n\nLet our care assessment guide you\n\nOur free tool provides options, advice, and next steps based on your unique situation.\n\n3. Amenities\n\nAmenities vary greatly from one community to the next, but most assisted living communities offer the following:\n\nGyms\n\nBeauty salons and barber shops\n\nOutdoor spaces like gardens or courtyards\n\nPet-friendly accommodations\n\nTransportation services\n\nLibrary, TV, and game rooms\n\nArts and crafts studios\n\nSpas or relaxation rooms\n\nMemory care communities often feature many of these same amenities, but you’ll also find unique layouts and design features to help orient residents and reduce confusion. For instance, design elements in memory care communities may include the following:\n\nClearly defined common areas\n\nColor-coded walls to make it easier for residents with memory loss to find their way\n\nOutdoor gardens to prevent residents from feeling trapped or confined\n\nIncreased opportunities for personalization, like memory boxes outside of residents’ doors to guide and help them feel at home\n\n4. Activities and therapies\n\nAssisted living staff organize activities for active seniors who may need some help with everyday tasks. With this demographic in mind, assisted living offers plenty of social opportunities. A wide range of planned activities are scheduled to appeal to different interests. These activities may include:\n\nExercise classes\n\nBook clubs\n\nGames\n\nParties\n\nKaraoke\n\nOutings\n\nMemory care offers both group and individual memory care activities and therapies designed specifically for seniors with memory loss.\n\n“There’s focus on structure, sensory stimulation, getting direct sunlight whenever possible, and cultivating engagement. All of these things minimize or even eliminate sundowning, help with sleep patterns, and allow residents to enjoy their days,” Bradley says.\n\nMany memory care facilities provide activities tailored to residents’ interests and programs that encompass the physical, mental, and spiritual aspects of health.\n\nSome of the specialized therapies available at memory care communities may include the following:\n\nMusic therapy, which promotes relaxation and reduces agitation in seniors with Alzheimer’s or other types of dementia\n\nArt therapy, which may help slow cognitive decline\n\nReminiscence therapy, which uses senses like smell, taste, touch, and sight to help seniors remember people, events, and places\n\nPet therapy for companionship\n\n5. Costs\n\nMany factors affect the costs of assisted living and memory care, including the following:\n\nLocation\n\nRoom size\n\nWhether a space is shared with a roommate\n\nWhat services are provided\n\nBeyond this, costs are calculated a little differently for each care type.\n\nGeneralized assisted living communities typically charge a base monthly rate that covers the following:\n\nRoom and board with three meals a day and snacks\n\nMost activities (outings may cost extra)\n\nHousekeeping and laundry\n\nTransportation to and from medical appointments\n\nHelp with ADLs may be an additional charge, depending on how much assistance a resident needs.\n\nAcross A Place for Mom’s partner communities, the nationwide median price of assisted living community is $4,995 per month.[02] The cost of memory care tends to be higher, with a median monthly cost of $6,200 per month across our partner communities.[02]\n\nMemory care communities are more expensive because they offer specialized care and services that general assisted living communities typically don’t offer.\n\nAssisted living vs. memory care: What services are offered?\n\nThis chart summarizes the key differences in services offered at assisted living and memory care communities.\n\nServicesAssisted LivingMemory CareHelp with ADLsxxMeal servicexxMedication managementxxCare coordinationxxHousekeeping and laundry servicesxxExercise classesxxTransportation to appointmentsxxSpecialized care for dementia and memory lossx24-hour care and supervisionxxSecured entrances and exits to prevent wanderingxMemory-enhanced therapiesxHigh staff-to-resident ratioxUnique layouts to reduce confusionx\n\nRead related article:Find Assisted Living for Adults with Mental Illness: A How-To Guide\n\nHow to decide between assisted living and memory care\n\nBradley encourages families to be mindful of their loved one’s prognosis as they consider the main differences between assisted living and memory care.\n\n“It helps to understand the kind of dementia your loved one has and how quickly it is expected to progress,” says Bradley.\n\nSome seniors in the middle stages of dementia may begin to need a higher level of supervision. For others, this happens a little later. It’s best to include input from your loved one’s doctors or other caregivers when making a decision.\n\nChoosing assisted living\n\nAssisted living may be a good fit for your loved one if memory loss isn’t an immediate concern or if they’re in the early stages of dementia. Sometimes it may also be a good fit for seniors experiencing the middle stages of dementia, provided that they don’t wander.\n\n“Assisted living communities can be very helpful with things that matter during the early- and mid-stages of dementia, such as managing medications and helping with reminders for showering, meal times, and the like,” Bradley says.\n\nIf you’re unsure about how advanced your loved one’s dementia is, you may want to speak with their doctor to determine if they’re showing signs it might be time for memory care.\n\nChoosing memory care\n\nAs dementia progresses and symptoms worsen, many families do opt for memory care.\n\n“Oftentimes, safety is the driving factor for deciding it’s time to make the switch to memory care,” says Bradley. “If their loved one is prone to going for walks and getting lost, for example, assisted living is no longer an option. They may also start doing things like trying to drink their shampoo or get restless later in the day.”\n\nIn addition to a memory care facility’s built-in security features, the 24-hour oversight provided by staff in a memory care community can significantly add to a senior’s safety.\n\nMemory care in assisted living: A promising third option\n\nSome assisted living communities also offer advanced memory care units on-site, so that both care types are available within the same community. This can be a good long-term care option for seniors. For instance, a senior with early-stage dementia may be able to move to a general assisted living community first and then transition to the memory care level later, if needed.\n\n“This is the ideal situation,” says Bradley. “It’s much less traumatic for the person living with dementia to simply change rooms or locations in the same community. They know the staff, recognize the surroundings, and oftentimes there’s intermingling for activities and events. They can still see their friends.”\n\nOn the other hand, moving from one community to a completely new one may require more thoughtfulness from family members to help ensure that the move goes smoothly.\n\n“As dementia progresses, moving someone can be very hard on them and even trigger a big decline in condition,” says Bradley.\n\nTalk with a Senior Living Advisor\n\nOur advisors help 300,000 families each year find the right senior care for their loved ones.\n\nNext steps as you consider memory care\n\nWhen you’re weighing options, it’s important to remember that each community is unique and what’s available to you will vary depending on your loved one’s location and budget.\n\n“I would strongly encourage families to check out a number of care settings,” says Bradley. “In some places, memory care may have advanced-stage dementia residents and look like a skilled nursing setting. Other memory care communities have more active, vibrant populations. There’s a wide variety of culture and care approaches, including specialized neighborhoods and the Montessori model.”\n\nAccording to Bradley, this might be the most important part of the process.\n\n“Finding the right fit for your loved one can make all the difference when it comes to quality of life for Mom or Dad and satisfaction for the rest of the family.”\n\nIf you’re looking for options in your area, A Place for Mom’s Senior Living Advisors can help by considering your loved one’s lifestyle, budget, and abilities to make the right recommendations — all at no cost to your family.",
      "# [20 Nutritious and Easy Recipes for Senior Nutrition by Claire Samuels on 2024-04-30](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/easy-recipes-for-senior-nutrition)\nKey Takeaways\n\nSeniors often lose interest in cooking. Medication side effects, changing taste buds, physical difficulty, and eating alone are all reasons older adults may not cook.\n\nMany stores offer pre-cut vegetables and canned ingredients, which reduces prep time. Tasty veggie recipes include stir-fry, stuffed sweet potatoes, and garlicky roasted eggplant.\n\nCooking with grandchildren can make it more enjoyable. Pizza dough, homemade ice cream, and vegetable nachos can be fun, easy, and memorable recipes for the grandkids.\n\nMany seniors don't drink enough water. To combat dehydration and improve health, seniors can infuse water with fruits and herbs.\n\nPreparing and planning easy meals for seniors\n\nWe’ve compiled 20 delicious and easy meal ideas for seniors that combine fresh produce with pantry staples for fulfilling dinners, side dishes, and drinks. The best part? Each easy recipe requires minimal prep, has seven or fewer steps, and is on the table in under an hour.\n\nMeal planning can be even easier now, as many grocery stores make cooking more accessible by offering fresh, pre-cut fruits and vegetables. This reduces prep time as well as physical strain for older adults with arthritis or another health condition that makes chopping difficult. But frozen fruits and veggies are also great to keep on hand — you don’t have to worry about upcoming expiration dates, and they can help you pull a nutritious meal together quickly.\n\nAn unhealthy diet can lead to a range of illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease, cancers, and diabetes, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).[01] Incorporate some of the following recipes for elderly parents to help you or an aging loved one combat illnesses and maintain a well-balanced diet.\n\nRead more:10 Health Tips for Seniors\n\nVeggies shine in these easy recipes for seniors\n\nA rainbow of fresh, in-season fruits and vegetables add vitamins and minerals to your diet. If you have a farmers market near you, stock up on locally grown favorites. If you don’t, your grocery store should offer delicious produce all year. Adults should aim to eat at least 14 ounces (or 1 1/2 cups) of fruits and veggies each day, according to WHO.\n\n1. One-pan salmon and vegetables\n\nThis recipe is so easy, it’s almost not even a recipe. It showcases flaky and rich pink salmon, a low-calorie protein source full of heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids and energy-boosting B vitamins.[02]\n\nThis non-recipe is versatile! Replace salmon with another flaky fish like tilapia or trout. Swap out the veggies for whatever’s in your fridge, or add potatoes for a heartier meal.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 squash or zucchini, sliced into rounds\n\n½ onion, cut into wedges\n\n1 cup cherry or grape tomatoes\n\n1 bell pepper, sliced\n\n3 tablespoons olive oil, divided\n\n1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning or your favorite fish-seasoning blend\n\n2-3 salmon fillets, about 4 ounces each\n\n1 lemon, optional\n\nInstructions\n\nPreheat oven to 450 F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil (not wax paper).

Sauté, stirring frequently, until soft — about 5 minutes.\n\nSprinkle cooked onions over the pastry dough, then top with tomato slices so they don’t overlap. Sprinkle with cheese and half of your seasoning or herbs. Season with salt (or salt replacement, if you’re avoiding sodium) and pepper to your tastes.\n\nBake for 25 minutes until the crust is golden. Sprinkle with the remaining herbs, cut into squares, and enjoy!\n\n3. Roasted root vegetables\n\nRoot vegetables — like sweet potatoes, beets, parsnips, and carrots — are vibrant and versatile. They’re high in fiber and antioxidants, and some have been proven to stabilize blood sugar as a successful part of a diabetic diet.[02] They’re also a tasty replacement for classic roasted potatoes — and just as easy to make.\n\nThis recipe involves chopping firm vegetables, which may be difficult for some seniors. To get the benefits of root vegetables without as much knife work, check out the recipe for Stuffed Southwest Sweet Potatoes below.\n\nIngredients\n\n½ red onion, cut into wedges\n\n1 large sweet potato, peeled\n\n2 large carrots, peeled\n\n1 large beet, scrubbed and trimmed\n\nSeveral new potatoes, skin on, cut in halves or quarters\n\n¼ cup olive oil\n\n4 teaspoons mixed dried herbs, like rosemary, oregano, and parsley\n\nInstructions\n\nPreheat oven to 400 F and grease a large baking sheet.\n\nCut root vegetables into even-sized pieces, about an inch each.\n\nToss root vegetables with olive oil, herbs, salt, and pepper.

Cook the protein, stirring regularly, until lightly browned and cooked through. Add vegetables and cook for another 5-10 minutes, until soft. Remove meat and veggies from the pan and set aside.\n\nMix all sauce ingredients in a small bowl. Add the mixture to your pan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Simmer for about 3 minutes or until slightly thickened.\n\nAdd vegetables and protein back to the pan and stir to combine.\n\nServe over brown rice or noodles for a filling meal.\n\n6. Garlicky roasted eggplant with creamy yogurt sauce\n\nEggplant is the star of this easy meal idea for seniors and is a great source of senior nutrition that boasts phytonutrients — a memory booster — and fiber for digestive health.[02] It’s also a soft food that’s easy on dentures without being mushy.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 eggplant, cut into ½-inch slices\n\n2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped (use pre-chopped from the jar if easier)\n\n¼ cup olive oil\n\n1 teaspoon Mediterranean spice blend or your favorite blend\n\nInstructions\n\nPlace eggplant slices on a baking sheet and sprinkle with salt. Let them sit for a couple minutes while your oven preheats to 400 F (this softens them and reduces bitterness).\n\nMix garlic, olive oil, and spice blend in a small bowl.\n\nBrush both sides of eggplant with the olive oil mixture for a dose of heart-healthy fats.\n\nRoast eggplant for about 30 minutes, until caramelized, flipping once about halfway through.\n\nFor the Creamy Yogurt Sauce\n\n1 cup Greek yogurt (a great source of probiotics for digestive health)\n\n1 clove garlic, finely chopped\n\n1 tablespoon lemon juice\n\n1 teaspoon honey\n\n1 tablespoon fresh herbs, like basil or mint (optional)\n\nMix all ingredients in a small bowl; add salt and pepper to taste. Serve your roasted eggplant with the yogurt sauce for a fresh, Mediterranean dish. Consider brown rice, whole-grain pasta, or chopped cucumbers and tomatoes as a side dish.\n\n7. “Anything goes” quiche\n\nQuiche has been a popular brunch food for decades and was seen as a luxury for many seniors growing up. This is a fairly inexpensive, easy meal idea for elderly adults that includes leafy greens rich in magnesium, iron, manganese, and vitamins A, C, and K.[02] Make this tasty treat for breakfast and enjoy leftovers throughout the week.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 refrigerated pie crust\n\n5 eggs\n\n1 cup half-and-half\n\n½ teaspoon seasoning of your choice, such as mustard, dill, or rosemary\n\n¾ cup crispy bacon, crumbled cooked sausage, or leftover ham, chopped\n\n1 cup shredded cheddar or Swiss cheese\n\n1 cup spinach or kale, torn or chopped\n\n½ cup of your favorite veggie, diced (tomato, broccoli, asparagus, and peppers are good options)\n\nInstructions\n\nPreheat oven to 350 F and roll pie crust into your pie plate.\n\nWhisk eggs, half-and-half, and seasoning in a medium bowl.\n\nSprinkle meat, cheese, and veggies onto the prepared pie crust evenly.

Let cool 10 minutes before slicing and enjoying.\n\nRecipe adapted from Pillsbury, with vegetables added\n\nLet our care assessment guide you\n\nOur free tool provides options, advice, and next steps based on your unique situation.\n\nEasy pantry staple meal ideas for elderly adults\n\nAll of these easy-to-cook recipes for seniors are a nutritious rewrite of a traditional classic. Plus, they all use at least three pantry or freezer staples to minimize shopping and stay budget-friendly. While carbohydrates are often talked about in a negative light, they’re actually part of a healthy diet and help aging adults find energy to fuel their daily activities, according to WHO.[01]\n\n8. Healthy-ish tuna veggie casserole\n\nThis no-fuss take on the classic is perfect for a rainy afternoon when you’re in the mood for something hearty but nutritious. The pasta provides whole grains, while the tuna offers heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D, which are both great for senior nutrition.[02] Broccoli and peas are also rich sources of nutrients and antioxidants.\n\nNote: If arthritis makes opening cans difficult, invest in an electric can opener — it’s a great kitchen tool!\n\nIngredients\n\n1 (12-ounce) bag whole-wheat egg noodles\n\n2 (5-ounce) cans tuna, drained\n\n2 (10 ¾-ounce) cans cream of mushroom soup\n\n2 cups frozen veggies, like peas, broccoli, carrots, or a combination\n\n½ cup milk\n\n1 cup shredded cheddar cheese\n\n8 buttery crackers, like Ritz\n\nInstructions\n\nPreheat oven to 350 F and grease a 3-quart casserole dish or 13-by-9-inch pan.\n\nCook whole-wheat noodles according to package directions; drain thoroughly.\n\nMix the warm cooked noodles with tuna, soup, veggies, milk, and cheese. Season with salt and pepper as desired (you can add some red pepper flakes for a kick). Spoon into your prepared pan.\n\nCrush up your crackers into small chunks and spread over the top. Feel free to add some more shredded cheese!\n\nBake for 20 minutes until golden, bubbly, and beginning to brown. Serve warm.\n\nRecipe adapted from The Spruce Eats\n\n9. Southwest stuffed sweet potatoes\n\nSweet potatoes are a powerhouse of nutrients, vitamins, and minerals — and they keep as pantry staples for nearly a month.[02] They also may improve your immune system with high levels of vitamin A.\n\nIngredients\n\n2 large sweet potatoes, washed and dried\n\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n\n1 (12 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained*\n\n1 (10 ounce) can diced tomato pepper mix, drained\n\n1 cup shredded cheddar or pepper jack\n\n*For a soft food substitute, use refried black beans.\n\nInstructions\n\nPreheat oven to 425 F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or nonstick aluminum foil.\n\nCut potatoes in half lengthwise, then brush with olive oil and salt.\n\nBake potatoes (cut side down) for 30 minutes or until cooked through.\n\nRemove from oven, allow to cool slightly, and mash up potato flesh with a fork.\n\nSprinkle potatoes with beans, tomato pepper mix, and cheese so the toppings are evenly divided.\n\nReturn to the oven for 5 minutes until cheese is melted.\n\n10. Chickpea tuna salad\n\nHigh-protein chickpeas are a good source of magnesium and potassium, which may reduce blood pressure.[02]\n\nIngredients\n\n1 (15-ounce) can low-sodium chickpeas, rinsed and drained\n\n1 (5-ounce) can tuna, drained and flaked\n\n1 tablespoon Dijon mustard\n\n3 tablespoons olive oil mayonnaise (regular mayo works just fine but is higher in cholesterol)\n\n1 cup halved cherry tomatoes\n\n½ cup green or black olives, or 2 tablespoons capers (optional)\n\nSpinach or torn salad greens\n\nInstructions\n\nAdd the chickpeas, tuna, mustard, mayonnaise, and cherry tomatoes to a bowl and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper to your liking. Add olives or capers, if using.\n\nLay a bed of spinach or greens on a plate and top with salad mixture for an easy dinner. Alternatively, eat the salad between two slices of whole-grain bread like a tuna salad sandwich.\n\n11. Simple soup\n\nThis is a go-to healthy recipe for seniors because it’s open to substitutions and relies on nutrient-dense pantry staples. It’s also a soft food that works for seniors who have trouble chewing or other dental problems.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 pound ground beef, Italian sausage, or turkey\n\n1 small onion, diced\n\n1 (32-ounce) box low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth\n\n1 (15 ounce) can cannellini or white beans\n\n1 (10 ounce) can crushed or diced tomatoes\n\n1 cup frozen or canned spinach or collard greens (use fresh if you’ve got them on hand)\n\n1 teaspoon Italian seasoning\n\nInstructions\n\nAdd meat to a large soup pot over medium heat. Break apart and stir until browned. Add onion and continue to cook, about 5 minutes, until soft.\n\nIf a fair amount of fat has collected at the bottom of your pan, pour the meat mixture onto paper towels to drain. This may not be necessary for ground turkey or lean beef.\n\nReturn meat and onions to the pot and add remaining ingredients. Reduce heat to low and simmer for about 30 minutes until the flavors have melded. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\nServe alongside crusty whole-grain bread for a filling meal, or, for a heartier meal, add cooked pasta before serving.\n\nTip: If you’re cooking for someone who prefers softer food, a good trick for soups or stews is to blend half and add it back into the pot for a smoother texture. If blending part of the soup, use caution. The liquid will be hot, and, if not handled with care, blenders can splatter the liquid, creating a burn risk. Make sure to keep a hand on the blender lid while blending to reduce the risk of it coming off.\n\n12. Four bean salad\n\nThis easy recipe is a classic for a reason! The dressing is tangy and sweet, and beans provide proteins and B vitamins.[02] We switched out traditional vegetable oil in favor of olive oil for a more heart-healthy fat.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 (15-ounce) can wax beans\n\n1 (15-ounce) can green beans\n\n1 (15-ounce) can kidney beans, drained and rinsed\n\n1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed\n\n1 white or yellow onion, thinly sliced\n\n⅔ cup white or apple cider vinegar\n\n½ cup white sugar or ¼ cup honey\n\n⅓ cup olive oil\n\nInstructions\n\nMix all ingredients together in a large bowl or Tupperware container. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\nRefrigerate overnight, or at least for several hours, to marinate. Enjoy as a side for grilled chicken or as a topping for green salad.\n\n13. Italian stuffed peppers\n\nBell peppers are a low-calorie, high-flavor vegetable containing folate, fiber, and iron, making them a great source for senior nutrition.[02] They’re also a good base for a variety of fillings and sauces. This versatile, easy recipe could even be made as Mexican stuffed peppers with salsa and taco seasoning.\n\nIngredients\n\n4-6 bell peppers (red, green, yellow, and orange all work)\n\n1 pound ground Italian sausage or ground beef\n\n1 cup cooked quinoa, wild rice, or whole grain of your choice\n\n1 (15-ounce) jar or can tomato sauce\n\n1 cup frozen spinach\n\n1 tablespoon Italian seasoning\n\n½ cup shredded low-fat mozzarella\n\nInstructions\n\nPreheat oven to 350 F and grease an 8-inch glass baking dish or casserole.\n\nCut the tops from peppers, scoop out seeds, and rinse.\n\nIn a medium skillet, cook beef or sausage about 10 minutes, or until browned. Remove from heat and drain the meat, then return to pan.\n\nStir grains, 1 cup of the tomato sauce, spinach, and seasonings into the cooked meat.\n\nNestle peppers, standing up, into the baking dish. Stuff them with the meat, grain, and spinach mixture until full.\n\nPour remaining tomato sauce over the peppers and top with shredded mozzarella. Cover the baking dish tightly with aluminum foil.\n\nBake 20 minutes covered. After 20 minutes, remove the foil and bake about 10 minutes longer until cheese is melted and bubbly.\n\n14. Creamy pasta and peas\n\nBright green peas — a low-fat legume naturally high in protein and fiber — and fresh lemon are flavorful ingredients that give easy recipes a pop of color and flavor. This dish also offers plenty of onion (full of antioxidants) and olive oil, a heart-healthy, vegetable-based fat.[02]\n\nIngredients\n\n1 zucchini or summer squash, cut into thin rounds\n\n1 small onion, diced\n\n2 tablespoons olive oil, plus some for serving\n\n½ pound short pasta, like shells or penne\n\n1 pound bag frozen peas\n\n½ cup grated Parmesan cheese\n\nLemon juice to taste\n\nFresh basil, if desired\n\nInstructions\n\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil on the stove.\n\nWhile the water heats up, sauté zucchini or squash, onion, and olive oil over medium heat in a separate pan.\n\nCook pasta according to package directions, adding your frozen peas to the boiling water with 5 minutes remaining.\n\nRemove 1 cup of starchy pasta water from the pot and set aside.

      "# [Senior living referral site accused of using manipulated reviews, listing communities providing substandard care by Kimberly Bonvissuto on 2024-05-17](https://www.mcknightsseniorliving.com/news/senior-living-referral-site-accused-of-using-manipulated-reviews-listing-communities-providing-substandard-care/)\nAn analysis published by the Washington Post on Tuesday calls into question A Place for Mom’s description of itself as a “trusted advisory service,” accusing the senior living referral site of recommending communities that have been cited for neglect or providing substandard care and of using reviews that have been manipulated by providers.\n\nThe Post reviewed inspection reports for communities on A Place for Mom’s “Best of Senior Living” lists and said that a large number of those communities had been cited for violations, including medication errors, bedsores, falls, staff misconduct and exposure to hazards. The Post compared 863 of the company’s “Best of Senior Living” award recipients in 2023 and 2024 to state inspection reports, saying that 324 (37.5%) were cited for serious violations affecting resident care.\n\nThe media outlet noted that information is excluded from the referral sites’ list recommendations for assisted living communities, although it noted that the website included a link to a guide on how consumers can investigate potential issues at communities.\n\nA spokeswoman for A Place for Mom told McKnight’s Senior Living that it is continually improving its processes based on feedback from residents and their families.\n\n“A Place for Mom is proud to serve as an important resource to family caregivers,” the company said in a statement. “Our national team of senior living advisors help to simplify a complex process, speaking with over 700,000 families every year. We are dedicated to our mission, providing access to transparent information, tools and resources to help families make informed and confident senior care decisions.”\n\nReviews questioned\n\nThe Post story also questioned the validity of the consumer reviews on A Place for Mom’s site.\n\nCurrent and former sales managers at Pacifica Senior Living, StoryPoint Group, Brookdale Senior Living and Cogir Senior Living told The Post in interviews that “facilities throughout the industry routinely manipulate the reviews by asking residents and families with only positive experiences to write them and sometimes by soliciting fake ones.” Those employees also said that the senior living providers also aggressively seek positive reviews on other online referral sites.\n\nA spokeswoman for StoryPoint Group told McKnight’s Senior Living that it encourages all reviews and follows up with residents, families and staff members whether the feedback is good or bad.\n\n“We consistently provide a range of opportunities for our residents and their families to give feedback in a manner that is most comfortable to them, whether that’s through in-person conversations, over the phone, letters and/or reviews,” StoryPoint said. “And most importantly, caring for our residents is our focus and priority, as it has been for nearly 40 years. We strive to make our communities the best that they can be through the continuous feedback we receive and openness with those we serve.”\n\nA spokesman for Argentum told McKnight’s Senior Living that consumer choice is a core pillar of assisted living and what sets it apart from other long-term care settings.\n\n“Residents and families are encouraged to make a comprehensive assessment of their individual needs when choosing a community, including reviewing the types of care and supportive services that are available; meeting with caregivers and other staff, residents and their families; and reviewing disclosures and state inspection reports,” Argentum said.\n\nUltimately, the Argentum spokesman said, word-of-mouth referrals often can be a deciding factor in selecting a community.\n\n“This serves as a key part of why residents and families routinely give assisted living high satisfaction scores, including 90% reporting high satisfaction, 85% reporting high value, and nearly three in four reporting improved quality of life,” Argentum stated.\n\nFounded in 2000, A Place for Mom was sold in 2017 to technology investment firm Silver Lake and global growth equity firm General Atlantic. Two years later, the company made news when it agreed to settle for $6 million a putative class action lawsuit that claims the company violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. The company at the time said it did not agree with the allegations.\n\nThe Post story is the latest in the media outlet’s “Memory Inc.” series, which began in December with a package on elopements in assisted living and memory care communities. A subsequent article focused on Brookdale Senior Living’s staffing algorithm. Assisted living providers also have come under scrutiny by other media outlets, including The New York Times and KFF Health News, which in November focused on the industry’s pricing structure, rate increases and the for-profit status of providers.\n\nThose stories prompted the US Senate Special Committee on Aging to hold a hearing in January and request that Brookdale, Atria Senior Living and Sunrise Senior Living answer questions about costs, staffing levels and resident safety in their assisted living communities.\n\nSome senators pondered increased federal involvement in the industry and called for the Government Accountability Office to study how much federal money is spent on assisted living communities, the cost of assisted living services, and the transparency and availability of that information to consumers. The committee also asked consumers to share their bills and experiences interacting with providers.\n\nSen. Bob Casey (D-PA), chairman of the committee, labeled the examination “the most significant congressional review of assisted living facilities in 20 years.”\n\nRelated articles:\n\nOnline reviews ‘possible, yet underexplored’ source of data on assisted living quality: study\n\nQuality, safety, accountability vital, industry leaders say, as Washington Post report cites deaths at ‘dangerously understaffed’ communities\n\nBrookdale’s staffing algorithm under fire for alleged chronic understaffing of communities\n\nFederal, lender support needed for assisted living operators to lower rates, leader says",

      "# [Senate probes A Place for Mom, referral service accused of putting seniors at risk by Tyler Kingkade on 2024-06-19](https://www.yahoo.com/news/senate-probes-place-mom-referral-171915601.html)\nThe Senate Special Committee on Aging is launching an investigation into A Place for Mom, the country’s largest for-profit senior care referral service, which has been accused of steering people toward facilities with documented safety and regulatory violations while collecting lucrative commissions.\n\nCommittee Chair Bob Casey, D-Pa., sent a letter Tuesday to A Place for Mom accusing it of misleading users about the role commissions play in its referrals and discriminating against low-income families. The letter, obtained by NBC News, requested three years’ worth of information about revenue the company has received from assisted living communities.\n\nA Place for Mom, launched in 2000, which bills itself as the biggest online referral service for senior living options, lists roughly 14,000 establishments in the U.S. and accepts payments from those facilities. But seniors and their families might not realize that’s less than half of the facilities on the market, the letter states.\n\nCasey’s letter also criticizes A Place for Mom for encouraging families to spend more than they can afford. It cites a frequently asked questions section of the company’s website that encourages facilities not to worry if they charge more than a family’s stated upper limit. According to the FAQ, nearly 40% of families who moved to senior living paid roughly $1,000 more per month than they had budgeted.\n\n“It is clear A Place for Mom is upselling families, and the company ultimately benefits from families spending beyond their means,” Casey wrote.\n\nThe FAQ also says its advisers do their best “to ensure that no federally funded family is referred” to the communities, effectively barring families who want to use Medicaid funding to cover assisted living costs.A Place for Mom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAssisted living and elder care are part of a booming industry that’s expected to continue expanding in the next two decades. The average monthly cost of assisted living is around $4,500 to $5,300, but it varies depending on location and the level of care required. A majority of the facilities are affiliated with chains or large corporations, and the quality of care has increasingly been called into question as private equity firms have taken greater ownership of the industry.\n\nIn 2010, The Seattle Times reported that A Place for Mom referred people to senior living homes without inspecting them for quality or safety, directing families toward facilities with documented abuse and neglect violations. The company said at the time that its advisers sometimes fall behind on visiting facilities in person but that many families were satisfied with its services.\n\nThis year, a Washington Post analysis found that more than a third of the facilities the website recommended as “Best of Senior Living” across 28 states had been “cited for neglect or substandard care in the past two years.” State oversight records reviewed by the Post alleged the facilities failed to properly tend to injuries, mismanaged medication and did not adequately monitor patients who later died. The company told the Post it encourages families to do their own research to make “an informed decision.”\n\nWhile A Place for Mom is the biggest senior living referral service, it is not the only website that receives commissions from facilities for finding them residents.\n\nKate Granigan, board president of the Aging Life Care Association, a nonprofit group that advocates for ethical standards in elder care, said that as long as the facilities foot the bill for referrals — rather than the consumers’ paying advisers for recommendations — the model is “ripe for conflict.” She said she would support legislation to require minimum transparency standards for referral services.\n\n“Transparency about how they get paid is important to the consumer. “As is the fact that they don’t represent everything that’s out there — they represent who pays them. I also think there should be transparency about their expertise,” Granigan said, noting that consumers may not understand that not all of the advisers who help them have medical backgrounds.\n\nA Place for Mom was previously owned by a private equity firm that simultaneously had invested in assisted living facilities, before the website was sold to the two other private equity firms that currently hold it, according to Casey’s letter.\n\nCasey’s letter asked A Place for Mom for its total revenue for each of the last three years and for the 100 facilities it received the most money from and referred the most people to over the same period. The letter also requested details on A Place for Mom's process for vetting facilities and the total number of move-in fees it received last year, along with copies of sample contracts. The company has until July 15 to provide the requested information.",
