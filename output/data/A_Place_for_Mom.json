APFM is a B2C company, with its revenue model based on commissions from partner facilities. The company has been named one of the fastest-growing firms in the United States, receiving more than 60,000 inquiries from family members per month [(Crunchbase, 2025)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/aplaceformom).\n\nAPFM has faced scrutiny regarding its business practices, particularly accusations of misleading families about the nature of its services and the quality of the facilities it recommends [(Kingkade, NBC News, 2024-06-18)](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/senate-announces-probe-place-for-mom-referral-service-rcna157282). Despite this, the company continues to be a significant player in the senior care referral space.\n\n# Key Personnel\n\nTatyana Zlotsky is the CEO of A Place for Mom, having taken on the role in April 2024. She focuses on improving relationships with senior living operators and enhancing the referral process. Under her leadership, the company has restructured its advisor roles and introduced new teams to better connect families with communities [(Regan, Senior Housing News, 2024-11-18)](https://seniorhousingnews.com/2024/11/18/how-a-place-for-moms-new-ceo-is-evolving-the-companys-relationships-with-operators/).\n\n# News\n\n## Senate Investigation\n\nIn June 2024, the Senate Special Committee on Aging initiated an investigation into A Place for Mom, prompted by allegations that the company directs families to facilities with documented safety violations while profiting from referral fees. Senator Bob Casey criticized the company for allegedly upselling families and for not adequately representing the full range of available facilities, particularly those that accept Medicaid [(Kingkade, NBC News, 2024-06-18)](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/senate-announces-probe-place-for-mom-referral-service-rcna157282).

      "# [What Is Senior Living? Costs, Benefits and Options by Jess Carney on 2024-02-19](https://www.aplaceformom.com/senior-living)\nSenior living encompasses a range of housing and care options for older adults, from senior apartments and independent living communities for active seniors to nursing homes for those with significant medical needs. Determining who needs senior living and what type of community they should live in depends on how much care they need:\n\nSenior apartments and independent living communities: The senior meets community age requirements and doesn’t need any care services.\n\nHome care and assisted living communities: The senior needs help with a couple of activities of daily living (ADLs), such as bathing and eating, but is otherwise independent.\n\nMemory care: The senior has symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease or another type of dementia, and they need help with ADLs.\n\nNursing homes: The senior needs skilled medical care for short-term or long-term conditions.\n\nThe costs and amenities of each community usually depend on the level of care provided and whether or not residents are given a maintenance-free, all-inclusive experience. Each senior living option is detailed below to help you find the best community for your needs.\n\nSenior living options range from senior apartments and other 55+ communities to nursing homes. The biggest difference between each option is the level of care they provide to residents.\n\nFor independent seniors who don’t need assistance, senior apartments or independent living may be the right fit. Active seniors who need help with activities of daily living (ADLs) may strike a balance of independence and support in assisted living communities or board and care homes. However, seniors with complex health conditions or a form of dementia may benefit more from memory care communities or nursing homes.\n\nDepending on the needs of the senior, home care or home health care may be a good fit. Home care services can provide companionship and daily support, while home health care services can offer prescribed in-home skilled nursing care.\n\nThere are a variety of reasons someone may choose to move to senior living or employ a home care provider. For independent seniors, the desire to downsize or simplify expenses may indicate that it’s time to consider senior living. If a senior begins to have a decline in activities of daily living (ADLs), receives a dementia diagnosis, or has a complex medical condition requiring regular care, it may be time to consider more involved senior care. Look for options that provide health services, such as assisted living, memory care, nursing homes, and home health care.\n\nTypically, the more specialized a senior living option is, the more it will cost. For example, nursing homes remain the most expensive senior living option while offering the highest level of care possible outside of a hospital setting. Other features like location, care type, floor plan, services and amenities, and pricing model will affect the monthly cost of senior care.\n\nKnowing what real families paid for care options can help you better plan for care and understand your budget. Below, you’ll see the monthly median senior living costs across the nation based on data from A Place for Mom’s 2024 Cost of Long-Term Care and Senior Living Report.\n\nWhen it comes time to cover the costs of senior care, families use both private and public pay options. Private payment methods include using funds from personal accounts, retirement savings, social security, and insurance. Some families may use public pay options, like Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans benefits.\n\nFinding the right senior living option comes down to three questions: What are your needs, what are your retirement goals, and what is your budget? Knowing the answer to these questions should help you narrow down which option will fit your family’s needs best. For example, if your loved one doesn’t require care services, but wants to pursue new hobbies and make new friendships, independent living might be a better option than a senior apartment or assisted living environment.\n\nAbove all else, the best way to determine which senior living option is best is to tour. Touring allows families to meet community staff and residents, ask questions, evaluate floor plans, and truly get a sense of what life in that community would look like. According to our data, 97% of families tour before making a final decision about their senior living options.",
      "# [What Is Memory Care? Services, Cost, and Benefits by seanleong on 2024-02-09](https://www.aplaceformom.com/alzheimers-care)\nMemory care is a type of long-term care community designed to meet the specific needs of individuals with a dementia diagnosis, like Alzheimer’s disease or another form of dementia. Memory care facilities offer 24-hour care and supervision, secured environments, specialized staff trained in dementia care, and memory-enhancing activities and therapies. Memory care can take place in apartment-like facilities, within a wing of an assisted living facility, or in smaller residential care homes. The goal of memory care is to provide an engaging, safe, and therapeutic environment for seniors with dementia to support their well-being and improve their quality of life. Individuals in the middle to later stages of dementia benefit most from a memory care environment.\n\nBenefits of memory care\n\nBecause dementia symptoms worsen over time, elderly adults with dementia are often unable to continue to live independently in their homes. If a family member is unable to take on the caregiver role, which can quickly become a full-time job, memory care is a great option. Memory care not only benefits seniors with dementia but also families who are feeling overwhelmed by their loved one’s advanced care needs. It gives families peace of mind that their loved one is in a secure and therapeutic environment with caregivers trained to handle difficult dementia behaviors.\n\nRead on to learn all about memory care benefits, specialized services, costs, and payment options. We also offer free tips on finding and moving to a community in your area.\n\nThe median national cost of memory care is $6,200 per month, according to proprietary data gathered by A Place for Mom. Costs vary greatly between communities and depend on factors like location, community amenities, programming, apartment size, and the level of care a senior requires. Pricing models also vary. For instance, some memory care communities may be all-inclusive, while others may use an a la carte approach and charge based on services required by a resident.\n\nMemory care base costs typically cover rent, utilities, meals and snacks, housekeeping, transportation to medical appointments, on-site activities, nonmedical therapies, and shared amenities. However, some amenities — such as in-unit internet service, beauty and barber services, laundry, and pet accommodations — may cost extra.\n\nWhile many families look to savings to finance senior care, there are other little-known funding sources that can help. The articles below can help you better understand pricing and the options available to help pay for memory care.",
      "# [What is a Nursing Home? Services, Cost and Options by Grace Hobson on 2024-02-26](https://www.aplaceformom.com/nursing-homes)\nNursing homes, also called skilled nursing facilities, provide 24-hour nursing and personal care for seniors. Nursing homes offer the highest level of care for seniors who need long-term or short-term medical care but don’t need hospitalization. Elderly adults who need long-term care at a nursing home often have severe physical or cognitive health conditions that require 24-hour nursing care. They may be incontinent, unable to eat independently, or unable to transfer from bed to a wheelchair without the assistance of a staff member.\n\nNursing homes play a crucial role in post-hospitalization care. They offer short-term rehabilitation for seniors recovering from illnesses, accidents or surgery. Rehab care focuses on restoring mobility, strength, and function so seniors can get back to their normal activities.\n\nNursing homes provide a distinctly higher level of medical care than other types of senior living, such as independent living, assisted living, and memory care. Nursing homes can also be called “care homes,” “skilled rehab facilities,” or “long-term care facilities.”\n\nElderly nursing home residents often have significant physical or mental health conditions that require long-term, 24-hour nursing and personal care. Seniors who can no longer lift themselves out of bed or who require daily skilled nursing are often ineligible for assisted living or memory care and may need nursing home care.\n\nFinding a nursing home for your loved one may feel overwhelming. You may have many different facilities to choose from, so how do you know which one is right? Start with your family member’s prioritized needs and consider the facility’s medical services and ratings.\n\nUltimately, there’s no substitute for visiting and experiencing a typical day at the nursing home. As you tour different facilities, be sure to ask whether the nursing home you’re visiting is Medicare or Medicaid certified and licensed if you plan on using your benefits to help cover your care costs there. You can also check the facility’s rating on the Medicare website.\n\nUse these resources to discover what to look for when searching for a nursing home and how to find the best nursing homes near you.\n\nNursing homes are more expensive than assisted living or memory care because they require medically trained staff and more supervision. Nursing homes may cost twice as much as assisted living or memory care facilities in your area.\n\nPaying for a nursing home is not always straightforward, and families can use multiple sources to cover nursing home costs. Often, some nursing home care can be covered with Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, or veterans benefits. Short-term stays in skilled nursing facilities for rehabilitation may be covered by Medicare, while indefinite stays in a nursing home will require some out-of-pocket payment for rent and meals. Learning how to pay for nursing home care now can help you plan for your future needs.\n\nA Place for Mom has the largest network of senior living communities and home care providers in the nation. We enable caregivers to make the best decisions for their loves ones.",

      "# [Independent Living Facilities in Washington](https://www.aplaceformom.com/independent-living/washington)\nWashington has earned its nickname as “The Evergreen State” for its wide swaths of coniferous forest. Many people may be most familiar with Seattle and its iconic Space Needle, but the eastern half of the state has a personality all its own, with a serene desert beauty akin to parts of Idaho or Montana. In contrast, Washington’s Pacific Coast is home to an actual rainforest. The state’s varied landscape as well as its relatively mild climate make it an ideal retirement destination.\n\nWhen it comes to retirement communities, Washington state has many great options. Currently, A Place for Mom partners with more than 300 independent living communities in Washington. The median monthly cost of independent living in Washington is about $2,600. A Place for Mom’s Senior Living Advisors can help you find the best retirement communities in Washington state.\n\nWashington doesn’t regulate independent living communities unless they share a building or campus with an assisted living or memory care facility. This means stand-alone independent living communities only need to abide by general housing and rental regulations. However, some communities do have their own residency requirements, like residents needing to be 55+, or 62+ in some cases.\n\nRegulations for independent living communities on a senior care campus\n\nIndependent living communities sharing a building or campus with an assisted living and/or memory care unit must follow the same policies those facilities do. The Department of Social and Health Services, Aging and Long-Term Support Administration licenses, regulates, and inspects these facilities to ensure compliance.\n\nRegulations for stand-alone independent living communities\n\nLandlords and tenants are responsible for following general housing and apartment guidelines in stand-alone independent living communities since Washington doesn’t regulate them. A landlord’s duties include:[01]\n\nMaintaining the premises to comply with applicable code, statute, ordinance, and regulations regarding the home\n\nKeeping any shared common areas reasonably clean\n\nMaking repairs and arrangements as necessary to keep the premises in good condition\n\nMaintaining structural components of the dwelling, such as the roof, floors, walls, chimney(s), and fireplace(s)\n\nKeeping all electrical, plumbing, heating, and other facilities and appliances in good working order\n\nProviding a reasonable amount of heat, water, and hot water\n\nGiving a written notice to all tenants disclosing fire safety and protection information\n\nSupplying tenants with information approved by the department of health about hazards associated with indoor mold\n\nProviding their name and address, as well as any changes, in writing, if the property has a new landlord\n\nLikewise, tenants have their own obligations, such as:[02]\n\nKeeping the premises as clean and sanitary as possible\n\nCorrectly disposing of garbage\n\nProperly using all electrical, gas, heating, plumbing, and other fixtures and appliances\n\nAvoiding intentionally or negligently destroying, defacing, damaging, or impairing the dwelling\n\nNot engaging in drug-related activity at the rental premises, or allowing a guest to do so\n\nMaintaining the smoke detection device\n\nRestoring the premises to its initial condition, outside of ordinary wear and tear, after the lease concludes\n\nProtections against discrimination\n\nSection 504 of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act, the Fair Housing Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) protect tenants from renting discrimination. The Washington Law Against Discrimination similarly shields tenants from prejudice based on:[02]\n\nRace\n\nCreed\n\nColor\n\nNational origin\n\nCitizenship or immigration status\n\nSex\n\nHonorably discharged veteran or military status\n\nSexual orientation\n\nPresence of any sensory, mental, or physical disability\n\nWashington landlords must also allow tenants to make reasonable accommodations and modifications to the property. Reasonable accommodations are changes in a policy, service, or program that lets someone with a disability fully access and enjoy the dwelling. This can come in the form of things like a reserved parking space near the tenant’s unit or allowing service animals despite having a no-pets policy.\n\nReasonable modifications are physical changes to the property that allow someone with a disability full enjoyment and access of the home/common areas of a community. Lowering closet rods, installing an entrance ramp, and adding bathroom grab bars are all examples of reasonable modifications. In Washington, tenants usually pay for modifications unless the property receives federal funds.\n\nHow to find independent living community inspection reports\n\nStand-alone independent living communities may not have state-mandated inspections, but some cities and counties do require them. For example, Othello passed legislation that states landlords must obtain a rental housing license that must be annually renewed and must take part in the city’s inspection program. Because of this, it’s worth checking with an area’s housing authority to see if any regulations like that are in place.\n\nState inspections and complaint investigations\n\nThe Department of Social and Health Services, Aging and Long-Term Support Administration conducts unannounced assisted living facility inspections every 18 months. The department checks that infection control, emergency preparedness, general design, and life safety requirements are being met, while also interviewing staff and residents. If staff or residents file a complaint against a facility, the department conducts the same kind of investigation.\n\nThe department logs violations in a Statement of Deficiencies (SoD) report that the facility receives. The facility’s administrator must acknowledge and sign the SoD. The facility then corrects any discovered problems, while also developing systems or programs to ensure the same issues won’t occur again. The department can make unannounced inspections at any time to confirm the corrections.[03]\n\nFinding state inspection reports\n\nThe department’s assisted living facility locator provides a facility’s inspection, complaint, and violation history. You can find a facility by searching for its name, zip code, or city to see a list of reports. Alternatively, you can request to see specific public records using an online form. The long-term care ombudsman service is available if you’re curious about a facility’s violation history.\n\nWashington Department of Health contact information\n\nWashington State Department of Health\n\n111 Israel Road SE\n\nTumwater, WA 98501\n\nPhone: 800-525-0127",
      "# [Independent Living Facilities in Vermont](https://www.aplaceformom.com/independent-living/vermont)\nVermont is primarily known for its scenic natural beauty, famous covered bridges, and popularity as a vacation and skiing destination. And yes, it’s also known for maple syrup – Vermont is the largest producer of maple syrup in the United States. Vermont’s expansive, serene woodlands, snowy peaks, and charming cities like Burlington make “The Green Mountain State” a perfect retirement destination.\n\nCurrently, A Place for Mom partners with more than 10 retirement communities in Vermont which offer independent living. The median monthly cost of independent living in Vermont is about $4,400.\n\nBecause they don’t provide care services, stand-alone Vermont independent living communities aren’t licensed or regularly inspected. However, due to the rental nature of independent living units, these facilities may be subject to some standards of the Vermont Rental Housing Health Code. They may also be subject to certain landlord and tenant laws as well as inspections by the Department of Health’s Town Health Officers.\n\nCertain senior living regulations may apply to Vermont independent living facilities if they share a campus with a higher level of senior living, such as a licensed assisted living community. Known as Assisted Living Residences (ALRs), these communities are licensed by the state’s Division of Licensing and Protection (DLP). They must provide daily activities and social interactions, provide three meals a day, and have at least one staff member in the community at all times.[01]\n\nVisit our Vermont assisted living regulations page to learn more about this care type.\n\nVermont renter and their rights\n\nMany independent living communities have a minimum age requirement of 55 years old, and in most cases, you can only move in if you don’t require any care services at the time. In addition to these requirements, you should be aware of your rights as a renter in your state.\n\nIn Vermont, senior renters should have access to the following features in their rental units:[02]\n\nA clean and safe living space\n\nProper heating, electricity, and both hot and cold water\n\nWorking smoke and carbon monoxide detectors\n\nAn environment that meets the standards of the Vermont Rental Housing Health Code\n\nYou’ll also have certain protections under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Fair Housing Act:[03]\n\nThe right to reasonable accommodations, including living with a service animal, having an accessible parking space, and adjusting rental payment due dates\n\nThe right to rental modifications, including doors that are wide enough for a wheelchair, bathroom grab bars, and ramps\n\nVermont Department of Health contact information\n\nVermont Department of Health\n\n280 State Drive\n\nWaterbury, VT 05671-8300\n\nPhone: 800-464-4343",

We require:\n\nExpert interviews and high-quality sources. Our writers use authoritative, primary sources to inform their content. We seek interviews with top experts and cite research from leading government, educational, industry, and research institutions. When citing journal publications, we lean on trusted, peer-reviewed studies.\n\nFact-checking. All content undergoes a rigorous fact-checking process that includes writers and editors to ensure that the information we publish is current as of the publication date.\n\nExpert panel. Our expert panel closely collaborates with A Place for Mom’s editorial team across articles, videos, and more, bringing their decades of rich professional experience to add additional context and depth to our content.\n\nArticle reviews. Both A Place for Mom and external experts in their field review our articles before publication to verify accuracy and ensure they align with the latest industry trends and information.\n\nUse of proprietary data. With reliable community data based on over 200 data points on approximately 14,000 senior living communities, nearly 400,000 reviews from residents and their families, and independent reporting, we strive to ensure our data serves you. We use our data to better refer and inform seniors and families, and more effectively score and rank communities, cities, and states. We never manipulate data, nor do we enter into paid marketing partnerships with our in-network communities.\n\nTimely corrections and content updates. If we discover or are informed of a factual error, we post a correction. We review all content on a regular basis and schedule content updates to ensure that our content remains accurate over time. If you believe you have identified an error in our content, please email us at content@aplaceformom.com. The editorial team will consider your feedback and update as necessary.\n\nEditorial independence\n\nOur editorial team is solely responsible for the production of all editorial content, including but not limited to articles, community information, downloads, guides, location-based content, product roundups, and reports.\n\nIn order to maintain full authority over the editorial content, we insist on:\n\nNo influence from our community partners. A Place for Mom’s community partners have no influence over editorial decisions, and our editorial team does not recommend communities based on business relationships.\n\nNo influence from business partners. A Place for Mom’s business partners have no influence over editorial decisions or the editorial lineup. Product reviews are not based on business relationships and do not generate revenue. Occasionally, when a product or service is relevant to an article topic, we may mention A Place for Mom business partners in editorial content. Partner ads are set apart from content, and we clearly disclose any and all financial relationships.\n\nNo compensation in exchange for content. We do not accept compensation of any kind in exchange for clicks or mentions in article content.\n\nOur subject matter\n\nA Place for Mom’s content covers a wide variety of topics pertaining to seniors and caregiving. Our content is designed to address the full spectrum of the aging experience for both seniors and their families.\n\nSenior care and home care. With robust data on over 14,000 senior living communities, A Place for Mom brings unique insights to common questions seniors and caregivers have about all things senior living, from independent living to assisted living, and even nursing homes.\n\nCaregiver support. Caring for a senior loved one can present challenges for caregivers. Our content seeks to provide information to empower caregivers, helping them understand the situations they face in caring for a senior and the options they have for support.\n\nLocation-based insights. With nearly 400,000 reviews from residents of senior living communities and their families, A Place for Mom compiles our data to give seniors and caregivers the best information about senior care in a given city or state. We evaluate the senior-friendliness, regulations, and more to give you the information you need to assess whether a location will fit you or your senior loved one.\n\nHealth and wellness. Seniors face unique health challenges, and A Place for Mom wants to empower them – and their caregivers – to live life to the fullest! Our health and wellness content is reviewed by health care experts to ensure it reflects current medical knowledge and best practices.\n\nProducts. We seek to highlight products that make sense and make life easier for seniors and their families. These product roundups do not generate any revenue for A Place for Mom, nor are they based on any business relationships. We seek first and foremost to put together product information that helps caregivers and seniors alike.\n\nHow we source interviews from communities and families\n\nA Place for Mom helps caregivers make the best care decisions for senior loved ones. The service is free for families. Here’s how it works.\n\nThe editorial team occasionally utilizes A Place for Mom’s network of partner communities and families that have used our service in order to source:\n\nInterviews with senior living experts. Our partner communities are a rich source of senior care experts and staff who can provide you with inside information about how senior care agencies and communities operate. We clearly identify when sources are affiliated with a community, and communities do not influence or review editorial content.\n\nInterviews with caregivers or seniors. We use family interviews to provide you with real, firsthand accounts from people who have walked in your shoes. To protect the privacy of the families who share personal information with us, we only publish the source’s first name and city/state location.\n\nHow we decide what products and services to feature\n\nProduct roundups — content that lists multiple products or services, like best cell phones for seniors or best GPS trackers for seniors — are not based on business relationships and do not generate revenue for A Place for Mom. Product roundups are purely editorial and research-based. All thoughts and opinions are our own.\n\nWe occasionally mention A Place for Mom business partners in editorial content. Our criteria for featuring partner products or services include:\n\nRelevance to you. The product or service must be relevant to the article topic and potentially helpful for you or your family member.\n\nDisclosure of financial relationships. We will clearly disclose any financial relationships at the point of mention.\n\nSee also\n\nWe strive to provide you with clarity and transparency about our business practices and use of data.

      "# Post ID 1gzlutn: PSA: Avoid “A Place for Mom” and Other Senior Living Referral Companies with +130 score by [(inspiredinsanity, Reddit, 2024-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenX/comments/1gzlutn/psa_avoid_a_place_for_mom_and_other_senior_living/)\n\n\nIf you’re planning to look into assisted living, memory care, or other senior living options in the near future, here’s a heads-up: those “free referral services” advertised on TV aren’t as helpful as they seem.\n\nYou’ve probably seen those commercials with Joan Lunden talking about how they’ll “match you” with the perfect community for your loved one. Sounds great, right? But here’s the catch: these services aren’t free—your chosen senior community is footing the bill by paying these referral companies an entire month’s worth of rent and care as a referral fee. That’s money that could’ve been used for resident care, staff, or improved services.\n\nThese companies act more like middlemen than advocates. Worse, they “own” your information for life once you engage with them, making it harder to connect with communities directly. It’s no wonder they push you toward the largest (often private-equity-owned) communities—they prioritize profits over personalized care.\n\nWhat’s a better way?\n\n\t1.\tUse Google or state resources to search for local communities yourself.\n\n\t2.\tVisit communities in person, ask lots of questions, and tour the facilities. You’re keeping an eye on the number of direct care staff you see during this tour. If “everyone is helping someone” then no one is there to help your mom. \n\n\t3.\tReview state databases for licensing and inspection reports.\n\nSkip the middleman, and you’ll get a much better sense of whether a place feels like home—without sacrificing your loved one’s care to pay referral fees.\n\nTL;DR: “A Place for Mom” and similar services are referral companies that profit off your choice by charging communities massive fees. Instead, research and tour senior communities on your own for better results.\n\n\n## Comment ID lyxndhe with +28 score by [(DebianDog, Reddit, 2024-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenX/comments/1gzlutn/psa_avoid_a_place_for_mom_and_other_senior_living/lyxndhe/) (in reply to ID 1gzlutn):\nWe have money to put my Mother in a “decent place” and she stayed there for a while but like everything these days they hire better people for marketing than they do for taking care of your family. The corporate greed and low dollar basically unskilled labor just seemed wild to me.\n\nWe finally ended up pulling her out of there, after looking at a few other places that were basically the same way, and ended up paying a friend to do everything that they said they were going to do and she got to stay in her home.\n\n### Comment ID lyxyuct with +20 score by [(skoltroll, Reddit, 2024-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenX/comments/1gzlutn/psa_avoid_a_place_for_mom_and_other_senior_living/lyxyuct/) (in reply to ID lyxndhe):\nHaving looked into the cost of nursing homes, in-home care comes out to be about the same price BUT the elderly stays in their home.\n\n$15k/month is $180k/year. You could easily hire 2-3 people to do the job 24/7, and they'll make more ($60k annually vs \\~$32k/annually), and they are charged with doing what YOU and your love ones want.\n\n*(I'm having this discussion regarding elder care now, but I'm just a stupid kid who doesn't understand.)*\n\n#### Comment ID lyynolf with +24 score by [(20thCenturyTCK, Reddit, 2024-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenX/comments/1gzlutn/psa_avoid_a_place_for_mom_and_other_senior_living/lyynolf/) (in reply to ID lyxyuct):\n24/7 in-home care is 20-25k per month.

That happens more often than not. It's very unusual to have reliable caregivers when you hire them directly. When you get caregivers through agencies, expect a different person when one calls in. Private caregivers often will not have Insurance, and background checks should be done. Hiring Private Care through a home care agency gives you better protection. People suffering from Dementia or Alzheimer's may not respond well if there is a different caregiver - Confusion Increases. Personalities clash.  So the math is good, the reality is often very challenging. That's why so many people chose a Community Based Memory Care or Assisted Living home.\n\n#### Comment ID lz00qnr with +1 score by [(LetsGototheRiver151, Reddit, 2024-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenX/comments/1gzlutn/psa_avoid_a_place_for_mom_and_other_senior_living/lz00qnr/) (in reply to ID lyxyuct):\nNot quite.

Most are all owned, in part or in whole, by the same group. Between Welltower, Ventas, and Brookdale (major investor Black Rock), most senior housing is viewed as an asset for investors instead of healthcare for older adults. \n\nFor example, in multifamily you are priced by door and the door price is around $100k - $150k. In 2022, senior housing average cost of a community sold for $320k per door. Senior housing has been a REITs focus for many years now and starting in 2026 the \"silver tsunami\" is scheduled to arrive to flush the investors gold.

PLEASE do not use them-they’re predatory, do not care about you or your loved one and will sell your loved ones information to every marketing firm they can think of. They only work with communities who pay for their referrals and, as others have said, high quality communities don’t have to pay for referrals. The “counselors” will send your loved ones information to every community they contract with in your general area, they do nothing to actually determine what is best for your loved one, they just want the money for the placement contract. If you are looking for care please check the Nursing Home Compare site on Medicare.gov or speak with the long term care ombudsman in your area. Google is also your friend, read reviews, take tours (most communities are happy to accommodate a virtual tour if needed), talk to others who have had to move their loved one into care, or look for local placement services (they’re smaller and tend to be actually client focused).

I am a former senior advisor for a similar company. And we did things very differently. \n\nAPFM will hire any warm body that will work under their pressure.  I remember a time where you had to have experience to be an advisor for APFM. That stopped years ago.\n\n\nI have 16 years in the industry and spent most of that time in the dementia field.\nI truly “advised” and coached my families through the process because the industry is confusing. I was honest and taught them how to do their due diligence when vetting a community. After all, in most cases they were choosing their loved ones last home. Kind of a big deal. If they had an interest in a community we did NOT partner with, I still reached out and collected that info or set a tour there if the family wanted it. I know that isn’t the norm in this business. But I would appreciate it if the show was on the other foot.\n\nSenior living is big business and unfortunately that’s most businesses these days.\n\nAnd one fallacy I saw posted here by another user I want to clear up. APFM isn’t just used by bad communities that need heads in beds. Pretty much all your major senior living players use referral agencies and so do the lesser known communities to capture online business. This is and has been the model for sometime. The only exceptions tend to be CCRC communities and non profit or religious affiliated communities. And even some of them have changed course and started working with placement agencies both online and boots on the ground types.\n\n## Comment ID l7i5v7j with +1 score by [(wherespamgoeslol, Reddit, 2024-06-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/1d55k9e/friendly_warning_do_not_use_a_place_for_mom/l7i5v7j/) (in reply to ID 1d55k9e):\nTried going through them to find a place for my mom had one of the agents schedule an appointment for me to tour a facility and when I got there, the facility said they didn't have a tour scheduled for that day.

Especially when more and more emergencies happen (because that’s what happens.)\n\nThe continuum of care means that it’s available when they need it (because that’s what happens) and it’s way better for them to be in the same place so that it’s not as foreign to them.

Many places increase the monthly fee as the resident’s needs increase.  I would look for a place associated with a non profit.  Don’t be impressed by the decor in the lobby.

A hospital social worker put them in contact with me when I was looking into whether or not there were any facilities that could take my dad with multiple forms of dementia. (the social worker was of no help at all with anything concerning my dad)  I had no idea that was actually who they were sending me to until a Senior Living Consultant from there contacted me. She of course recommended the communities that advertised with them and they were extremely expensive and all private pay. That part of the conversation was a waste of time and I let her know that we couldn't afford anything she was mentioning.  \n\n\nBut the lady I spoke with used to be a social worker and she was able to give me lots of other information about how to apply for certain benefits etc. My dad was in the service so she sent me links to things that could possibly help with veterans. She sent me a lot of other helpful links too about how to apply for medicaid etc. I realize all of that information is online but I was in a crisis situation and totally overwhelmed with trying to figure out what to do. Ultimately the information and resources she provided me with didn't turn out to be helpful for us but she was very kind and it was a good starting point to get some conversations going with my mother.

If you want to find out for yourself, try filling out their form without giving them a phone number, or only giving them a landline number.

This is officially more than his income and I'll need to top up his account to make rent.

There are also 1 bedroom/living area/bathroom as well. The monthly fee Included all meals, snack areas, weekly housekeeping. There are staff on site 24 hrs and if additional services required, then additional fees of course as that unfortunately is the retirement home model.

My mom was just diagnosed with dementia, and we have to move her into assisted living. Anyone know of a quality, engaging place for seniors with dementia or Alzheimer’s? Thanks 💛\n\n## Comment ID f47lfk6 with +30 score by [(RatherBeYachting, Reddit, 2019-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/djooas/where_to_live_with_dementia/f47lfk6/) (in reply to ID djooas):\nI'm sorry, this can be a trying time. I used to be in regional management for a large provider of assisted living/memory care so hopefully I can give you some good hints.\n\n* If you don't already, make sure your mom has a social worker. Multnomah County Aging and Disabilities will help you in the future. They're not necessary for picking a facility to place your mom, but in the future they will be a great resource for things such as finances, getting transportation to medical appointments, and the like. \n\n* You'll need to determine at what cognitive level your mother is at, and what her (immediate) future is. There are three options, listed in ascending order of care: assisted living, residential care, memory care. The person making the call on that should be you and a medical professional. \n\n* Do not let slick facility marketing people take advantage of you in this trying time. Their jobs and bonuses are contingent on getting a certain volume of move-ins each month. They'll try to convince you their place is perfect for your mom. As an FYI a lot of them charge a large move-in fee, but you have the leverage on that. If it comes to that, don't be afraid to bargain - they want your signature more so than the move-in fee and will make other concessions. \n\n* On note related to the point above: there are some placement services, such as A Place for Mom. I'm not saying these businesses are unethical, but they don't charge you. They do, however, charge the facility a \"finders fee.\" Some places pay larger commissions than others - make of that what you will. \n\n* As for the differences between assisted living and memory care: assisted living allows for more socialization, and if your mom is in the early stages of dementia that might be better. If she is having issues that could be a safety risk then it would be memory care, which is a locked facility. \n\n* Get financials figured out. I'm sure you're already aware that IT IS EXPENSIVE. Medicaid is the one that helps, but facilities prefer private payers - the previously mentioned social worker will be able to help you navigate this maze. If you don't already have it, power of attorney is also necessary. Very, very few people have long term care insurance, so I'm not going to bother mentioning it. \n\n* I'm not going to recommend a specific facility or chain. All of them have good or bad things. The more important thing is how comfortable you and your mom are there. A convenient location to the primary contact (you?) never hurts. Size of facility is a factor, some have hundreds of residents with many activities, some are as small as 10 people out of converted homes. \n\nHope that helps, if there are any questions you have feel free to ask.\n\n## Comment ID f46zto7 with +14 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/djooas/where_to_live_with_dementia/f46zto7/) (in reply to ID djooas):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID f47l5c0 with +2 score by [(TheSheDM, Reddit, 2019-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/djooas/where_to_live_with_dementia/f47l5c0/) (in reply to ID f46zto7):\nI used to walk by there all the time when I lived near Tabor.

You will have better luck getting accepted to a place if she has private insurance. Medicaid is a bit more of a challenge as places will have space available, but only a small fraction of those are allotted for residents on Medicaid/OHP. We were fortunate that another family member works in the industry and was able to help us. They said that the website aplaceformom.com is pretty fair as far as reviews. If you call around, most places are more than accommodating for giving tours for potential residents.

She needs more help (my dad does a lot but he is pretty old).\n\nI've been googling all day but it's overwhelming and I don't want to get fleeced so-to-speak without more knowledge how to navigate this.\n\nMy wife's grandmother spent her last days in what was basically an apartment building with a cafeteria and on site nursing care, but not a nursing home is that makes sense. I think this would be ideal for my parents. Is this what \"assisted living\" is? \n\nAre there services or organizations that help people in my position? Or just any advice for this kind of thing in MA?\n\n## Comment ID kgd99rp with +22 score by [(SubstantialCreme7748, Reddit, 2024-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/18ytime/recommended_resources_for_getting_parents_into/kgd99rp/) (in reply to ID 18ytime):\nstart with an elder lawyer.......you kids need to decide on an agreeable power of attorney as well as health care proxy\n\ngetting them into assisted living is pretty easy if the resources are there. you visit facilities and when you choose one, there will be a need assessment (in terms of the level of assistance needed) and they will come up with a cost.\n\ndon't do this online.......websites like a place for mom will bombard you....as was mentioned, go to community senior center for information.\n\n### Comment ID kgdc7sa with +3 score by [(ilikehamsteak, Reddit, 2024-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/18ytime/recommended_resources_for_getting_parents_into/kgdc7sa/) (in reply to ID kgd99rp):\nI second seeking support from a lawyer specializing in elder law.\n\nHere’s a reputable firm I know of - https://www.eckel-law.com/.

You should *not* allow yourself to be put in a situation where you carry the bulk of the responsibility, but don't (at least!) have simultaneously the authority to carry your responsibilities out.\n\nPeople who have power take responsibility, if they don't want responsibility then they need to let someone else take over and give them the authority to be effective.\n\nTends to cause bitterness and bad blood for years when responsibility isn't delegated appropriately in this kind of situation.\n\n>They are unlikely to transfer it to me\n\nAssuming your parents would also agree to you having POA, this is a *demand* in exchange for your continued position taking point in this process, it's not a request.

I moved my parents into assisted living this summer and sold their house in November. Also in MA.\n\nI called ALFs local to me and set up tours. They went on two and wrote a deposit check at the second one. We moved them in a few weeks later. There are different levels of care available, costs go up the more care they need. There are RNs on staff 24/7 in case of emergency. My mom has Alzheimer's and will move up to the memory care unit once my dad passes.\n\nContact the Elder Care services for their area and talk to them about options.

If anything they will get you going in the right direction. They will help you roughly determine level of care needed and then you can look at assisted living places that suit those needs, your finances, etc. If your parents are in their sound minds and willingly choose to move to an assisted living facility, I don’t think power of attorney is needed. If they aren’t as willing, that’s when things get complicated. Regardless of power of attorney, you can still contact A Place For Mom or really any facility you think is a good fit to help you navigate the process and to ask questions.\n\n## Comment ID kgde1gq with +2 score by [(SLEEyawnPY, Reddit, 2024-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/18ytime/recommended_resources_for_getting_parents_into/kgde1gq/) (in reply to ID 18ytime):\n>I think this would be ideal for my parents.\n\nHow do they feel about it? \n\nIf they aren't at least somewhat willing participants then the situation becomes significantly more difficult.\n\n### Comment ID kgdhydl with +3 score by [(BasicDesignAdvice, Reddit, 2024-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/18ytime/recommended_resources_for_getting_parents_into/kgdhydl/) (in reply to ID kgde1gq):\nIt's really hard to say, I think my dad knows it's true but someone else needs to pull the trigger.\n\n#### Comment ID kgdm3uu with +3 score by [(SLEEyawnPY, Reddit, 2024-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/18ytime/recommended_resources_for_getting_parents_into/kgdm3uu/) (in reply to ID kgdhydl):\nRight. My late mother was quite stubborn and so I ended up helping care for her at least part time for several years, but she was quite...her. I had the financial ability to do it at that point and seemed the path of least resistance, at least for a while.\n\nGood news is I think the majority of elderly parents are less stubborn than that. Bad news is that a situation has to be pretty far gone before anyone in a position of authority like e.g. state elder services or the courts will step in to force the issue, assuming no one has financial/medical power of attorney. And family's idea of \"can't care for themselves\" sometimes differs from the authority's definition.\n\nBut if they truly can't care for themselves, won't willingly participate in making a change, and nobody steps in to assist voluntarily then the situation *will* eventually go that way. \n\nAs family I know part of what we fear most is some kind of catastrophic accident forcing the issue and I wish I knew a surefire way to prevent that possibility, unfortunately I don't. Mom agreed to a Lifeline and some cameras for use in an emergency, which helped give me a bit more peace of mind.\n\nBut that's a worst-case scenario and hopefully not applicable to your situation.\n\n## Comment ID lemxbt0 with +1 score by [(ShoppingHot4314, Reddit, 2024-07-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/18ytime/recommended_resources_for_getting_parents_into/lemxbt0/) (in reply to ID 18ytime):\nI’m very interested also ??????\n\n## Comment ID kgdhszw with +1 score by [(Accurate_Mango6129, Reddit, 2024-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/18ytime/recommended_resources_for_getting_parents_into/kgdhszw/) (in reply to ID 18ytime):\nGo to Ukrainian Boston Facebook group bf hire a middle aged woman who has all the skills for home care and good common sense be pay her to come every day to watch after them or hire a professional 24/7 home health if service at home.\n\n## Comment ID kgee384 with +1 score by [(New-Vegetable-1274, Reddit, 2024-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/18ytime/recommended_resources_for_getting_parents_into/kgee384/) (in reply to ID 18ytime):\nThere are tiered managed care facilities where you can live independently on the top tier down to assisted living and if the need should arise, move into total care living. In the case of couples, that can be tailored to each individual. There is such a place in Charlton MA called the Overlook that has a solid reputation. There are others around the state I'm sure but this is the one I'm most familiar with. Speaking from experience, please don't put your parents in a one size fits all nursing home, some are better than others but they're all understaffed and the staff they have are over worked. The patients basic needs are met but for the most part they are warehoused with few activities and are either in bed 24/7 or parked in a wheel chair in a hallway or day room and ignored. It doesn't matter if a patient is high functioning cognitively or demented they are all treated the same. That's as good as it gets and from there it goes down hill and there are even some horror stories. Places like the Overlook are pro resident, well staffed and have a variety of activities that are tailored to the individual. For the higher functioning residents there is a good deal of socializing special dinners, dancing, exercise groups, even field trips. Of course these places aren't cheap and will probably eat up the proceeds from the sale of their property and other assets if there's any. But whatever that is, if a resident outlives their money they're care is guaranteed for the rest of their lives.\n\n## Comment ID kgg78wc with +1 score by [(Black_Cat_Just_That, Reddit, 2024-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/18ytime/recommended_resources_for_getting_parents_into/kgg78wc/) (in reply to ID 18ytime):\nIf you're overwhelmed with doing it all on your own and want some solid advice, I highly recommend this company:\nhttps://2sisters-sla.com/assisted-living-advisory-service/\n\nIt's basically like outsourcing all of the research and planning.

With infinite money, you put them in a gold plated Continuing Care Retirement Community that has independent living, assisted living, memory care, and rehab & skilled nursing all on the same campus.  The best of them have part time on-site geriatric physicians, geriatric psychiatrists, and dentist/hygienist.  You ideally want them to be close to a top hospital with lots of specialists.  \n\nIf you put them in an assisted living facility that doesn’t have all this, any time anything health-related happens, they’re ejected to the emergency room in an ambulance and it’s up to you to deal with it.  \n\nI had my mother in a traditional for-profit assisted living apartment.  She had dementia issues where she couldn’t possibly live independently and didn’t have the financial resources to have staff come to the house.    She landed in the hospital several times and I had to drop everything to go deal with it.   It was 50 minutes away so inconvenient.     She eventually declined to the point where she couldn’t remain in a traditional assisted living apartment.   That facility had memory care but it wasn’t very good.    I moved her to the memory care building of a CCRC campus.   They had at least a physician’s assistant on site weekly and usually a geriatric physician and geriatric psychiatrist to deal with meds.   Eventually, she moved across the driveway to the big building with the skilled nursing and rehab floor and the physician group office immediately below it.  \n\nMy mother eventually ran out of money after all the years of assisted living and memory care.   The CCRC was in Connecticut.  Their memory care building had four wings of 13 rooms where each wing had a common living room and dining area.   The four wings shared a large common area where they had fairly continuous activities.   One of the four wings was licensed for a state program.   When she eventually ran out of money, she converted to a state housing program and moved to an identical room in that dedicated wing.   She was in a state-authorized pooled trust to knock her income down to qualify for Medicaid.   When she then needed to go to skilled nursing, she went as a Medicaid patient with higher priority than anyone off the street.  \n\nI don’t know if Massachusetts has a similar program to the Connecticut one.  If there are dementia problems and any chance of running out of money, I’d want to understand that.   \n\nMedicaid nursing homes are pretty frightening.  I looked at quite a few."

Employee, customer and prospect satisfaction and quality experience isn't even discussed, much less focused on.\n\nNo fixed breaks or lunches. Your schedule will change daily, without warning. Lunches deviate on a day to day basis up to or over 90 minutes, breaks can deviate by more than that. They say this is to help with coverage, but coverage has never been an issue. This is purely to make scheduling easier for an outside team.\n\nPay has actually gone down repeatedly and certainly hasn't kept up with inflation. There are NO performance reviews or conversations. They don't even notify you when your pay changes. They hide a lot of the changes in changes to the bonus structure, but it's still there.\n\nYou will never, ever make as much money per year after the first year. It's extremely frontloaded for income.\n\nHyper fixation on metrics without the rationality behind it. This isn't atypical in the industry, but a lot of the tracked metrics are entirely outside of your control. There's also a ton of micro tracking. If your monthly rate for something is 50%, but on a Tuesday you're at 40% for that day, even if you're at 60% the other 4 days, they focus on Tuesday. They do not understand how averages work, especially in small sample sizes.\n\nYou will be micromanaged, you'll work at least a couple of holidays a year, the pay is below what you'd make in other Senior Living non-remote jobs, no schedule consistency and inconsistence company policies are a constant issue. Also, take a sick day? Are you SURE you were really sick enough to take a sick day? Because you can totally take them, but as a reminder, you'll probably make less money now because of it. (As if employees don't know how a commission pay structure works)\n\nAnd finally?\n\nThe ELT is a joke for employees. Their entire focus is on the investors and entirely arbitrary financial goals that are based on nothing but wishful thinking. They're actively pushing AI, they're reducing spending while demanding more results. They send out emails after a poor month demanding that everyone really try to work harder in the future, despite the company being over set goals.",

Their quotas are extremely high and unattainable, their staff turnover rates are incredibly high too. Lead quality is terrible, most people who are calling in are Medicaid leads and APFM does not support people who are not private pay. \n\nAPFM preys upon vulnerable elderly people. I felt very morally conflicted here and the leaders at this company simply don’t have a conscience. They want you to use hard sales tactics on these families and senior citizens and harass them frequently. The standard of living in most of these communities that APFM is partnered with is very very poor. \n\nThere are metrics for your every move in the role, be prepared to be micromanaged every step of the way. 50 dial minimum per day, referral rates are tracked, you must book a tour on every call, those numbers are tracked. \n\nYou can make good money with your commission if you’re able to get to quota. The thing is, is that they intentionally make it impossible to get to goal, so you’re never able to make that extra money. You don’t get paid any commission until you’re over 50% to your quota, so be prepared to only be paid your base pay. \n\nI went into the role very optimistic and have given it my all. You’re in a group of about 30 people for training initially, every person I was in training with, is no longer with the company. I’ve managed to hang in there but as you can see, I’m looking for other opportunities. It’s probably the most stressful role I’ve ever had as they do threaten job security if you aren’t making quota. \n\nThey also offer a sign on bonus, but if you leave the company for the 1 year make, they’ll make you pay it back. \n\nI would highly recommend seeking employment elsewhere.",

For being called a place for mom, they sure don’t care out their employees or their employees families. It is business first - always! \n\nMicromanagement at all levels - I was an RM &amp; I was micromanaged to micromanage my SLA team. That type of fear leadership doesn't help anyone.

The Chief Sales Officer's blatant disregard for staff welfare, prioritizing customer satisfaction over employee morale, flies in the face of the company's purported values. Despite the founders' efforts to instill a positive culture, it's evident that employees are viewed as expendable assets rather than valued contributors.Human Resources fails miserably in its role as a safeguard against mistreatment, rendering it ineffective for protecting employees from verbal abuse and poor treatment. The appalling behavior exhibited by upper management on national calls, resorting to derogatory language and insults towards the team, is utterly unacceptable for any professional setting.While the company boasts about its training programs, the reality falls short, with incomplete and ineffective execution. The President's incompetence, demonstrated by an inability to operate basic tools like PowerPoint, further undermines confidence in leadership during town hall meetings.Lamentably, A Place for Mom lacks coherent direction and fails to execute effectively. Micromanagement tactics are wielded as instruments of intimidation, with every call monitored and management fostering a culture of fear rather than motivation. The abundance of purportedly \"5-star\" reviews reeks of manipulation by upper management to maintain inflated ratings.Despite lip service paid to teamwork and collaboration, the reality is starkly different. From top to bottom, the company is rife with dysfunction, making it unthinkable to recommend their services to anyone. A Place for Mom is a far cry from its advertised image, and I would caution against entrusting the care of loved ones to such an organization.",

Hitting 50% sounds easy until you see how many people actually can do that. \n\nOld school/closed minded company - they warn you of this before you start but there’s absolutely no wiggle room; you must work holidays/nights/weekends/end of month. For being called a place for mom, they sure don’t care out their employees or their employees families. It is business first - always! \n\nMicromanagement at all levels - I was an RM &amp; I was micromanaged to micromanage my SLA team. That type of fear leadership doesn't help anyone.

The Chief Sales Officer's blatant disregard for staff welfare, prioritizing customer satisfaction over employee morale, flies in the face of the company's purported values. Despite the founders' efforts to instill a positive culture, it's evident that employees are viewed as expendable assets rather than valued contributors.Human Resources fails miserably in its role as a safeguard against mistreatment, rendering it ineffective for protecting employees from verbal abuse and poor treatment. The appalling behavior exhibited by upper management on national calls, resorting to derogatory language and insults towards the team, is utterly unacceptable for any professional setting.While the company boasts about its training programs, the reality falls short, with incomplete and ineffective execution. The President's incompetence, demonstrated by an inability to operate basic tools like PowerPoint, further undermines confidence in leadership during town hall meetings.Lamentably, A Place for Mom lacks coherent direction and fails to execute effectively. Micromanagement tactics are wielded as instruments of intimidation, with every call monitored and management fostering a culture of fear rather than motivation. The abundance of purportedly \"5-star\" reviews reeks of manipulation by upper management to maintain inflated ratings.Despite lip service paid to teamwork and collaboration, the reality is starkly different. From top to bottom, the company is rife with dysfunction, making it unthinkable to recommend their services to anyone. A Place for Mom is a far cry from its advertised image, and I would caution against entrusting the care of loved ones to such an organization.",

Their quotas are extremely high and unattainable, their staff turnover rates are incredibly high too. Lead quality is terrible, most people who are calling in are Medicaid leads and APFM does not support people who are not private pay. \n\nAPFM preys upon vulnerable elderly people. I felt very morally conflicted here and the leaders at this company simply don’t have a conscience. They want you to use hard sales tactics on these families and senior citizens and harass them frequently. The standard of living in most of these communities that APFM is partnered with is very very poor. \n\nThere are metrics for your every move in the role, be prepared to be micromanaged every step of the way. 50 dial minimum per day, referral rates are tracked, you must book a tour on every call, those numbers are tracked. \n\nYou can make good money with your commission if you’re able to get to quota. The thing is, is that they intentionally make it impossible to get to goal, so you’re never able to make that extra money. You don’t get paid any commission until you’re over 50% to your quota, so be prepared to only be paid your base pay. \n\nI went into the role very optimistic and have given it my all. You’re in a group of about 30 people for training initially, every person I was in training with, is no longer with the company. I’ve managed to hang in there but as you can see, I’m looking for other opportunities. It’s probably the most stressful role I’ve ever had as they do threaten job security if you aren’t making quota. \n\nThey also offer a sign on bonus, but if you leave the company for the 1 year make, they’ll make you pay it back. \n\nI would highly recommend seeking employment elsewhere.",

Employee, customer and prospect satisfaction and quality experience isn't even discussed, much less focused on.\n\nNo fixed breaks or lunches. Your schedule will change daily, without warning. Lunches deviate on a day to day basis up to or over 90 minutes, breaks can deviate by more than that. They say this is to help with coverage, but coverage has never been an issue. This is purely to make scheduling easier for an outside team.\n\nPay has actually gone down repeatedly and certainly hasn't kept up with inflation. There are NO performance reviews or conversations. They don't even notify you when your pay changes. They hide a lot of the changes in changes to the bonus structure, but it's still there.\n\nYou will never, ever make as much money per year after the first year. It's extremely frontloaded for income.\n\nHyper fixation on metrics without the rationality behind it. This isn't atypical in the industry, but a lot of the tracked metrics are entirely outside of your control. There's also a ton of micro tracking. If your monthly rate for something is 50%, but on a Tuesday you're at 40% for that day, even if you're at 60% the other 4 days, they focus on Tuesday. They do not understand how averages work, especially in small sample sizes.\n\nYou will be micromanaged, you'll work at least a couple of holidays a year, the pay is below what you'd make in other Senior Living non-remote jobs, no schedule consistency and inconsistence company policies are a constant issue. Also, take a sick day? Are you SURE you were really sick enough to take a sick day? Because you can totally take them, but as a reminder, you'll probably make less money now because of it. (As if employees don't know how a commission pay structure works)\n\nAnd finally?\n\nThe ELT is a joke for employees. Their entire focus is on the investors and entirely arbitrary financial goals that are based on nothing but wishful thinking. They're actively pushing AI, they're reducing spending while demanding more results. They send out emails after a poor month demanding that everyone really try to work harder in the future, despite the company being over set goals.",

      "# [Senate probes A Place for Mom, referral service accused of putting seniors at risk by Tyler Kingkade on 2024-06-18](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/senate-announces-probe-place-for-mom-referral-service-rcna157282)\nThe Senate Special Committee on Aging is launching an investigation into A Place for Mom, the country’s largest for-profit senior care referral service, which has been accused of steering people toward facilities with documented safety and regulatory violations while collecting lucrative commissions.\n\nCommittee Chair Bob Casey, D-Pa., sent a letter Tuesday to A Place for Mom accusing it of misleading users about the role commissions play in its referrals and discriminating against low-income families. The letter, obtained by NBC News, requested three years’ worth of information about revenue the company has received from assisted living communities.\n\nA Place for Mom, launched in 2000, which bills itself as the biggest online referral service for senior living options, lists roughly 14,000 establishments in the U.S. and accepts payments from those facilities. But seniors and their families might not realize that’s less than half of the facilities on the market, the letter states.\n\nCasey’s letter also criticizes A Place for Mom for encouraging families to spend more than they can afford. It cites a frequently asked questions section of the company’s website that encourages facilities not to worry if they charge more than a family’s stated upper limit. According to the FAQ, nearly 40% of families who moved to senior living paid roughly $1,000 more per month than they had budgeted.\n\n“It is clear A Place for Mom is upselling families, and the company ultimately benefits from families spending beyond their means,” Casey wrote.\n\nThe FAQ also says its advisers do their best “to ensure that no federally funded family is referred” to the communities, effectively barring families who want to use Medicaid funding to cover assisted living costs.A Place for Mom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAssisted living and elder care are part of a booming industry that’s expected to continue expanding in the next two decades. The average monthly cost of assisted living is around $4,500 to $5,300, but it varies depending on location and the level of care required. A majority of the facilities are affiliated with chains or large corporations, and the quality of care has increasingly been called into question as private equity firms have taken greater ownership of the industry.\n\nIn 2010, The Seattle Times reported that A Place for Mom referred people to senior living homes without inspecting them for quality or safety, directing families toward facilities with documented abuse and neglect violations. The company said at the time that its advisers sometimes fall behind on visiting facilities in person but that many families were satisfied with its services.\n\nThis year, a Washington Post analysis found that more than a third of the facilities the website recommended as “Best of Senior Living” across 28 states had been “cited for neglect or substandard care in the past two years.” State oversight records reviewed by the Post alleged the facilities failed to properly tend to injuries, mismanaged medication and did not adequately monitor patients who later died. The company told the Post it encourages families to do their own research to make “an informed decision.”\n\nWhile A Place for Mom is the biggest senior living referral service, it is not the only website that receives commissions from facilities for finding them residents.\n\nKate Granigan, board president of the Aging Life Care Association, a nonprofit group that advocates for ethical standards in elder care, said that as long as the facilities foot the bill for referrals — rather than the consumers’ paying advisers for recommendations — the model is “ripe for conflict.” She said she would support legislation to require minimum transparency standards for referral services.\n\n“Transparency about how they get paid is important to the consumer. “As is the fact that they don’t represent everything that’s out there — they represent who pays them. I also think there should be transparency about their expertise,” Granigan said, noting that consumers may not understand that not all of the advisers who help them have medical backgrounds.\n\nA Place for Mom was previously owned by a private equity firm that simultaneously had invested in assisted living facilities, before the website was sold to the two other private equity firms that currently hold it, according to Casey’s letter.\n\nCasey’s letter asked A Place for Mom for its total revenue for each of the last three years and for the 100 facilities it received the most money from and referred the most people to over the same period. The letter also requested details on A Place for Mom's process for vetting facilities and the total number of move-in fees it received last year, along with copies of sample contracts. The company has until July 15 to provide the requested information.",
      "# [The 7 Stages of Dementia by Leah Hallstrom on 2024-05-28](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/dementia-stages)\nKey Takeaways\n\nThere are seven stages of dementia, each with distinct symptoms. The stages are broken down into three phases of pre-, middle-, and late-stage dementia.\n\nDementia typically isn’t diagnosed until stage 4. Dementia stages 1, 2, and 3 are classified as pre-dementia stages, as symptoms aren’t yet severe enough for a diagnosis.\n\nThere’s no set timeline for how long each stage will last. Understanding the symptoms associated with each stage will help you monitor your loved one as the disease progresses.\n\nMemory care communities can help. Explore how thoughtfully designed memory care communities can support your loved one at any stage.\n\nWhat are the seven stages of dementia?\n\nHealth care providers use a comprehensive tool to assess the seven stages of dementia in the elderly called the Global Deterioration Scale.[01] Also known as the GDS, this trusted method enables caregivers and health professionals to determine how quickly dementia is progressing in an elderly patient. It also helps families and care providers know which symptoms to expect during each of the seven stages of dementia.\n\nLearning about the dementia stages can help caregivers track and monitor stage-related symptoms to identify a loved one’s brain-health status.\n\nThe seven stages of dementia include:\n\nStage 1: no cognitive impairment\n\nStage 2: very mild cognitive decline\n\nStage 3: mild cognitive decline\n\nStage 4: moderate cognitive decline\n\nStage 5: moderately severe cognitive decline\n\nStage 6: severe cognitive decline\n\nStage 7: very severe cognitive decline\n\nHow does dementia progress?\n\nThe seven stages are separated into three progressive phases or levels of dementia:\n\nPre-dementia or early-stage dementia (stages 1, 2, and 3). In this initial phase, a person can still live independently and may not exhibit obvious memory loss or have any difficulty completing regular tasks. Mild dementia symptoms mimic episodes of age-related forgetfulness.\n\nModerate or middle-stage dementia (stages 4 and 5). Moderate dementia symptoms significantly affect a person’s personality and behavior. Someone with middle-stage dementia will generally need full- or part-time caregiver assistance with regular day-to-day activities. Moderate-stage dementia symptoms include significant cognitive impairment and mood swings.\n\nSevere or late-stage dementia (stages 6 and 7). These final phases are associated with severe cognitive impairment along with a loss of physical abilities. Late dementia symptoms can include pronounced memory loss, incontinence, and an inability to move without help.\n\nSpecific types of dementias — including Alzheimer’s, vascular, Lewy body, and frontotemporal dementia — advance at unique rates and differ from person to person. Therefore, it’s important to understand the signs and symptoms at each stage so you can quickly identify whether your loved one’s dementia has progressed. Read on for a look at the symptoms related to each stage.\n\nDementia stage 1: No cognitive impairment\n\nThough it may sound odd, stage 1 dementia often looks like normal mental functioning without any cognitive decline. Someone in the first three stages of dementia doesn’t usually exhibit enough symptoms to be diagnosed.\n\nWhile mild cognitive impairment may be present, stages 1, 2, and 3 on the GDS are recognized as pre-dementia stages. However, it’s important to note that changes in the brain are still taking place in these early stages, which could eventually lead to a dementia diagnosis at stage 4.\n\nLet our care assessment guide you\n\nOur free tool provides options, advice, and next steps based on your unique situation.\n\nDementia stage 2: Very mild cognitive decline\n\nStage 2 dementia includes simple memory mistakes like a loved one wondering, “Where did I put my keys?” or “What was that person’s name?” This is a pre-dementia stage and does not yet warrant an official dementia diagnosis.\n\nA significant portion of the senior population experiences age-related forgetfulness, and caregivers or medical providers may not even notice such a mild impairment. This explains why stage 2 is also known as “age-associated memory impairment” on the GDS, meaning many older adults will experience symptoms like these at some point during aging.\n\n“About 40% of people aged 65 or older have age-associated memory impairment — in the United States, about 16 million people,” said Professor Gary W. Small in research published by the British Medical Association.[02] “Only about 1% of them will progress to dementia each year.”\n\nThis means that for many people, pre-dementia stage 2 does not progress to an official dementia diagnosis. Seniors can maintain at this stage for a long time or indefinitely with the right lifestyle changes that support their brain health.\n\nStage 2 dementia symptoms include:\n\nLosing track of familiar objects\n\nInability to recall names of friends, family members, and former acquaintances\n\nTalk with a Senior Living Advisor\n\nOur advisors help 300,000 families each year find the right senior care for their loved ones.\n\nDementia stage 3: Mild cognitive decline\n\nStage 3 dementia is also known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or decline. It doesn’t generally have a major effect on day-to-day functioning and may not yet result in an official dementia diagnosis. Memory and cognitive problems may become more regular and noticeable to caregivers and family members.\n\nHow quickly can this early dementia stage progress to a dementia diagnosis in the elderly?\n\nAn estimated 10 to 20 percent of people age 65 or older with MCI will develop recognizable or diagnosable dementia within a year, according to the National Institute on Aging.[03]\n\nSince MCI can precede more severe dementia, it’s important to recognize these stage 3 signs, and seek medical advice to support your brain health and keep the dementia from progressing.\n\nStage 3 dementia symptoms include:\n\nOften forgetting to go to appointments or events\n\nLosing things often\n\nGetting lost while traveling\n\nDecreased work performance\n\nDifficulty finding the right words\n\nVerbal repetition\n\nChallenges with organization and concentration\n\nTrouble with complex tasks and problem-solving\n\nProblems with driving\n\nDementia stage 4: Moderate cognitive decline\n\nStage 4 dementia is when a person has clear, visible signs of cognitive impairment and also exhibits personality changes, with significant dementia behaviors and severe stage 3 symptoms. A person is not typically diagnosed with dementia until they’re at stage 4 or beyond.\n\nWhile the medical terminology for stage 4 dementia is moderate cognitive decline, this stage is officially diagnosed by the GDS as “mild dementia.” At this stage, doctors and caregivers will likely observe hallmark signs that dementia is getting worse, including difficulties with language and reduced problem-solving skills.\n\nStage 4 dementia symptoms include:\n\nSocial withdrawal\n\nEmotional moodiness\n\nLack of responsiveness\n\nReduced intellectual sharpness\n\nTrouble with routine tasks\n\nForgetting recent events\n\nDenial of symptoms\n\nDementia stage 5: Moderately severe cognitive decline\n\nThis stage marks the onset of what many professionals refer to as middle-stage dementia or “mid-stage” in the seven stages of dementia. At this point, a person may no longer be able to carry out normal activities of daily living (ADLs), such as dressing or bathing, or instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) without some caregiver assistance.\n\nStage 5 often lasts between two and four years, though every dementia patient will progress at a unique rate.[04]\n\nIn stage 5 dementia, your loved one will likely require more intense support and supervision. They know major facts about themselves — such as their name and their children’s names — but they may not remember their grandchildren’s names, their longtime address, or where they went to high school.\n\nStage 5 dementia symptoms include:\n\nPronounced memory loss, including personal details and current events\n\nWandering\n\nConfusion and forgetfulness\n\nDisorientation and sundown syndrome\n\nFurther reduced mental acuity and problem-solving ability\n\nDementia stage 6: Severe cognitive decline\n\nStage 6 dementia marks a need for caregiver help to perform basic daily activities, such as eating, using the toilet, and other self-care. Seniors experiencing this stage of moderately severe dementia may have difficulty regulating sleep, interacting with others, or behaving appropriately in public settings.\n\nAt stage 6 of dementia, you may find yourself wondering if full-time care is necessary as symptoms become more complex. You can stay prepared by tracking symptoms, monitoring your loved one’s ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), and exploring care options like memory care or home care.\n\nStage 6 dementia symptoms include:\n\nSleep difficulties\n\nUrinary or fecal incontinence\n\nAggression and anxiety\n\nPersonality changes including paranoia or delusions\n\nInability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs)\n\nPronounced memory loss\n\nInability to recognize loved ones and caregivers\n\nDementia stage 7: Very severe cognitive decline\n\nIn stage 7, which is considered end-stage dementia, people can no longer care for themselves and are barely responsive as their verbal and physical capacities shut down. All verbal ability is lost, movement becomes severely impaired, and bodily organs begin to fail.\n\nStage 7 dementia symptoms include:\n\nInability to speak\n\nInability to remember loved ones or caregivers\n\nLack of physical ability to move without help\n\nInability to chew or swallow\n\nImpaired bodily functions, including breathing, and organ failure\n\nSleeping a lot\n\nUrinary and fecal incontinence\n\nHow long does this aggressive end stage of dementia last?\n\nThe final stage of dementia can typically last one to three years, but it’s difficult to predict since everyone is different.[05]\n\nHow fast does dementia progress?\n\nThere’s no way to predict how long it will take for a loved one to progress through all the stages of dementia. Lifestyle factors can make a big difference in how fast dementia will progress, like diet and exercise.\n\nDementia gets worse with time, but some people stay in the early stages of dementia longer and can remain independent for many years. Others may experience rapid dementia progression and will require more immediate support. Once a person reaches the final, most aggressive stage of dementia, they typically only have a couple years left.[05]\n\nHow long do people live with dementia?\n\nHow to care for a loved one with dementia\n\nCaregivers have a variety of ways to provide support to a loved one through the progression of dementia:\n\nTry to have positive and meaningful conversations using effective dementia communication strategies.\n\nConsider exploring unique dementia treatment options and therapies.\n\nCreate a dementia care plan.\n\nConsider joining a support group for caregivers.\n\nLearn about dementia care techniques for caregivers.\n\nFind memory care options in your area.\n\nComing to accept a loved one’s dementia diagnosis, and understanding what to expect, can help you feel empowered and provide opportunities to make the most of this time together.\n\nIf the idea of navigating a dementia diagnosis alone seems overwhelming, A Place for Mom is here for you. Explore our library of caregiver resources, which contains hundreds of articles covering dementia therapies and information on memory care communities.\n\nMemory care options\n\nMemory care is specialized support for seniors with a dementia diagnosis. These communities provide 24-hour supervision by trained memory care caregivers to reduce anxiety, assist with ADLs, and prevent accidents caused by wandering.\n\nMemory care communities also provide comfortable and thoughtfully designed living arrangements, meal services, and trained on-site nurses ready administer health care as needed. Therapeutic on-site memory care activities, dining plans, and exercise programs (for both mind and body) address all types of dementia symptoms. Whether through in-home care or at a community, specialized memory care can be beneficial from the early stages of dementia through the end of life.\n\nUnderstanding when to seek memory care will vary depending on a senior’s dementia symptoms, health status, living situation, and more. Our Senior Living Advisors offer free guidance and are ready to discuss local memory care communities or dementia home care options with your family, tailored to your budget and individualized needs.",
      "# [How A Place for Mom’s New CEO is ‘Evolving’ the Company’s Relationships With Operators by Tim Regan on 2024-11-18](https://seniorhousingnews.com/2024/11/18/how-a-place-for-moms-new-ceo-is-evolving-the-companys-relationships-with-operators/)\nA Place for Mom CEO Tatyana Zlotsky has been busy since she took the reins of the New York City-based company in April – all in the service of improving the company’s relationships with senior living operators.\n\nIn the last few months, APFM leadership has sought to make its online community search and referral process more friendly for senior living operators and families. Recent changes include restructuring its senior living advisor role for the first time in 10 years, and the creation of two new specialized teams meant to better connect communities and prospects.\n\nThe company’s leadership also now includes the top leader of a former senior living operator: Margaret Cabell, who previously worked as CEO of Harmony Senior Services and now serves as APFM’s chief community relations officer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company’s efforts can account for as much as 40% of an operator’s lead volume in any given month, and it is paid based on the success of its lead conversions. Therefore, the success of senior living operators and third-party referral partners like A Place for Mom is closely linked, Zlotsky said.\n\nThough there are many opportunities baked into the senior living industry’s incoming demand wave, APFM’s journey ahead is still likely fraught with challenges.\n\nOperators and their referral partners have had somewhat contentious relationships over the years, and many operators say they are still not entirely happy with the process of sourcing third-party leads from partners. Senior living referrals are also in a new era, and large companies including Brookdale Senior Living (NYSE: BKD) and Sonida Senior Living (NYSE: SNDA) are seeking to bolster their own in-house marketing strategies to reduce their reliance on third-party referral partners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that is not to mention the fact that companies like A Place for Mom are facing new pressure and scrutiny from the media and federal lawmakers, similar to the wider senior living industry.\n\nZlotsky believes the way forward for APFM lies in continuing to build trust and genuine relationships with operators, and the company’s efforts thus far have all been in the service of that.\n\n“If we don’t change, we become irrelevant,” Zlotsky told Senior Housing News. “So, we make constant investments into our company, our services, products and people.”\n\nFuture strategy hinges on advisors, understanding operators\n\nAs Zlotsky alluded, the company’s strategy moving forward is directly linked to the success of its family advisors and their ability to get them into senior living communities.\n\nIn March, APFM laid off its customer success management team, which at the time made up about 6.8% of its nearly 900-person workforce.\n\nThe company followed up that move by launching a new program called Family Live Transfer, which is meant to connect families directly with communities to facilitate conversations and in theory boost move-ins.\n\nBefore Family Live Transfer, APFM advisors would speak to prospects, gather some information, and then pass those leads on to communities, who followed up on their own. Under Family Live Transfer, advisors now directly connect families to senior living communities instead of simply passing on their information to communities to act upon.\n\n“The advisor reaches out, connects with the community, gives them a brief overview of the family, and then makes that connection. It’s a seamless experience for the family and for the caregiver,” Zlotsky said.\n\nAPFM created two new specialized teams to aid that process: “Welcome Advisors,” who guide families through the initial consultation process, such as care assessments, amenity and activity preferences, location, budget and tours; and “Senior Living Follow-up Advisors,” who serve as a connector between communities and prospects.\n\nThough that change might seem like a relatively small difference, it is a crucial one as it “takes the burden off of the operators to have to reach back out,” Zlotsky said. According to APFM, the program has generated 75% more tours within the first seven days of inquiry and 60% more conversions than other referral types.\n\n“Our strategy is to really center around our advisors,” she said. “They have the depth of knowledge and the experience in order to be able to partner with operators and move families forward in this complex senior journey. That’s key to our strategy.”\n\nTo better understand the senior living industry’s wants and needs, Zlotsky said she spoke with CEOs of operators and has visited many communities in the last seven months. The company is now in the process of forming a new advisory council for “thought leaders” in senior living to help APFM develop new products and services.\n\nCabell’s hiring also represents a pivot to understanding operators and their challenges in a deeper way. She joined the company in April and in the time since has already offered several ideas to make the company’s process more friendly for senior living operators, Zlotsky said. For example, Cabell suggested developing a new tool for operators wherein APFM would inform them when prospects toured their communities, with feedback on their experience.\n\n“She represents the needs of the community operators,” Zlotsky said. “She understands how they interpret the P&L and where A Place for Mom fits in, and she is able to much more clearly articulate why it’s such a great investment and why it’s such an important strategic partnership.”\n\nAt the root of the company’s ongoing pivot is the fact that Zlotsky and APFM believe the senior living industry is now in a new era with regard to how prospects find communities. She said that more than three-quarters of leads are now coming through digital channels. In fact, 85% of APFM’s new customers opt to text rather than call advisors to set up a meeting.\n\nTo cater to customers’ hunger for doing their own research, APFM has revamped its website, which garners over 20 million unique visitors a year, Zlotsky said. The company has bulked up its number of free articles for families, such as posts on the “seven stages of dementia;” and has built a new senior living cost calculator for families.\n\nSeparate from those efforts, APFM has also built a new and growing referral site for skilled nursing, and it also has a growing home care referral network.\n\nAt the end of the day, all of these efforts are aimed at putting APFM ahead of the times when it comes to senior living.\n\n“We have the great tsunami coming, and with so many seniors aging, the space is going to shift,” Zlotsky said. “We need to understand, anticipate and evolve.”\n\nNew era for referrals\n\nDespite its progress, APFM and other online referral companies face a fair share of challenges ahead.\n\nAPFM in particular has faced scrutiny over its online reviews. Sen. Bob Casey earlier this year alleged the platform had “deceptive business practices” that sometimes led families to more expensive senior living options. APFM also was subject to a Washington Post investigation regarding the quality of the communities on its platform and “serious violations affecting resident care.”\n\nThere is also the fact that APFM has in the past had some contentious relationships with senior living operators, some of which have complained about the quality and number of leads coming through their pipelines. That trend has inspired more boutique referral partners to launch their own businesses in recent years, with a focus on improving relationships with operators.\n\nMost recently, the CEOs of Brookdale Senior Living (NYSE: BKD) and Sonida Senior Living (NYSE: SNDA) have indicated they want to reduce their reliance on online referral partners and develop more of their own in-house marketing and sales practices. In particular, Brookdale CEO Cindy Baier said the company noticed “softness” among two third-party referral sources, though she did not say which two.\n\nAPFM is well-aware of the ongoing shift in senior living, the challenges ahead and the scrutiny on referral partners. As Zlotsky noted, that is why improving the company’s relationship with operators and keeping them using the platform will continue to be a big focus.\n\n“With any customer, you have to build trust, and you do that by understanding their needs and building products and services that meet their needs,” she said. “The greatest companies in the world are built on understanding customer needs and then exceptionally meeting them.”",

But frozen fruits and veggies are also great to keep on hand — you don’t have to worry about upcoming expiration dates, and they can help you pull a nutritious meal together quickly.\n\nAn unhealthy diet can lead to a range of illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease, cancers, and diabetes, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).[01] Incorporate some of the following recipes for elderly parents to help you or an aging loved one combat illnesses and maintain a well-balanced diet.\n\nRead more:10 Health Tips for Seniors\n\nVeggies shine in these easy recipes for seniors\n\nA rainbow of fresh, in-season fruits and vegetables add vitamins and minerals to your diet. If you have a farmers market near you, stock up on locally grown favorites. If you don’t, your grocery store should offer delicious produce all year. Adults should aim to eat at least 14 ounces (or 1 1/2 cups) of fruits and veggies each day, according to WHO.\n\n1. One-pan salmon and vegetables\n\nThis recipe is so easy, it’s almost not even a recipe. It showcases flaky and rich pink salmon, a low-calorie protein source full of heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids and energy-boosting B vitamins.[02]\n\nThis non-recipe is versatile! Replace salmon with another flaky fish like tilapia or trout. Swap out the veggies for whatever’s in your fridge, or add potatoes for a heartier meal.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 squash or zucchini, sliced into rounds\n\n½ onion, cut into wedges\n\n1 cup cherry or grape tomatoes\n\n1 bell pepper, sliced\n\n3 tablespoons olive oil, divided\n\n1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning or your favorite fish-seasoning blend\n\n2-3 salmon fillets, about 4 ounces each\n\n1 lemon, optional\n\nInstructions\n\nPreheat oven to 450 F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil (not wax paper). If you don’t have these, you can thoroughly grease the pan with vegetable oil.\n\nIn a large bowl, toss all veggies with 2 tablespoons of oil and seasoning, then spread them into a single layer on the baking sheet.\n\nNestle your salmon fillets, skin side down, between the vegetables. Brush with remaining olive oil and top with 2 thin lemon slices each.\n\nRoast for 12-15 minutes until salmon is flaky and mostly opaque.\n\nAdd 1 salmon fillet and a heaping serving of roasted veggies to each plate for a healthy and satisfying meal. Enjoy!\n\n2. Tasty tomato tart\n\nThis easy weeknight dinner is packed with lycopene and vitamin C to boost vision health and add to senior nutrition.[02] It’s similar enough to pizza that even picky eaters will try it — but it’s a total showstopper with fresh, colorful ingredients.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed\n\n1 onion, thinly sliced\n\n1 teaspoon olive oil\n\n2-3 large tomatoes (multiple colors make a beautiful tart, but red works just as well)\n\n1 cup of your favorite cheese (such as blue cheese, mozzarella, feta, or Parmesan)\n\n1 tablespoon Italian seasoning, or chopped fresh herbs like basil and oregano\n\nInstructions\n\nPreheat the oven to 425 F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or nonstick aluminum foil.\n\nStretch out the puff pastry on the lined baking sheet. With a fork, poke small holes along the bottom.\n\nAdd onions and olive oil to a skillet over medium heat. Sauté, stirring frequently, until soft — about 5 minutes.\n\nSprinkle cooked onions over the pastry dough, then top with tomato slices so they don’t overlap. Sprinkle with cheese and half of your seasoning or herbs. Season with salt (or salt replacement, if you’re avoiding sodium) and pepper to your tastes.\n\nBake for 25 minutes until the crust is golden. Sprinkle with the remaining herbs, cut into squares, and enjoy!\n\n3. Roasted root vegetables\n\nRoot vegetables — like sweet potatoes, beets, parsnips, and carrots — are vibrant and versatile. They’re high in fiber and antioxidants, and some have been proven to stabilize blood sugar as a successful part of a diabetic diet.[02] They’re also a tasty replacement for classic roasted potatoes — and just as easy to make.\n\nThis recipe involves chopping firm vegetables, which may be difficult for some seniors. To get the benefits of root vegetables without as much knife work, check out the recipe for Stuffed Southwest Sweet Potatoes below.\n\nIngredients\n\n½ red onion, cut into wedges\n\n1 large sweet potato, peeled\n\n2 large carrots, peeled\n\n1 large beet, scrubbed and trimmed\n\nSeveral new potatoes, skin on, cut in halves or quarters\n\n¼ cup olive oil\n\n4 teaspoons mixed dried herbs, like rosemary, oregano, and parsley\n\nInstructions\n\nPreheat oven to 400 F and grease a large baking sheet.\n\nCut root vegetables into even-sized pieces, about an inch each.\n\nToss root vegetables with olive oil, herbs, salt, and pepper. Spread in an evenly spaced layer on the prepared pan.\n\nBake for 30-40 minutes, stirring and flipping vegetables twice or until soft.\n\n4. Berry chicken salad\n\nFor a colorful and protein-packed lunch, this easy recipe for seniors repurposes leftover shredded or chopped chicken into a salad that replaces classic grapes with fresh, antioxidant-rich berries.\n\nIngredients\n\n¼ cup olive oil mayonnaise (regular mayo works just fine but is higher in cholesterol)\n\n1 teaspoon sugar\n\n½ teaspoon dried tarragon\n\n1½ cups chopped or shredded leftover chicken (about 1 breast)\n\n1 cup quartered fresh strawberries or whole fresh blueberries\n\n½ cup fresh or frozen peas, thawed\n\n¼ cup chopped celery\n\nTorn salad greens or spinach\n\nInstructions\n\nWhisk the first three ingredients together in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\nAdd chicken, berries, peas, and celery, and stir well to combine.\n\nScoop chicken salad over salad greens or spinach for a fresh and filling lunch.\n\nRecipe adapted from Taste of Home\n\n5. Vegetable stir-fry\n\nThis quick take on everyone’s favorite carryout dish can be adapted to whatever ingredients you have on hand and made in one pan for easy cleanup.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 tablespoon olive oil or non-hydrogenated vegetable oil\n\n½ pound protein, such as cubed chicken breast, sliced steak, or tofu\n\n2 cups mixed vegetables (such as peppers, zucchini, broccoli, onions, snap peas, and mushrooms)\n\nFor the sauce\n\n¼ cup orange juice\n\n¼ cup water\n\n2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce\n\n1 tablespoon honey\n\n1 teaspoon fresh ginger or a sprinkling of ginger powder\n\nInstructions\n\nHeat oil in a large wok or skillet over medium heat. Cook the protein, stirring regularly, until lightly browned and cooked through. Add vegetables and cook for another 5-10 minutes, until soft. Remove meat and veggies from the pan and set aside.\n\nMix all sauce ingredients in a small bowl. Add the mixture to your pan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Simmer for about 3 minutes or until slightly thickened.\n\nAdd vegetables and protein back to the pan and stir to combine.\n\nServe over brown rice or noodles for a filling meal.\n\n6. Garlicky roasted eggplant with creamy yogurt sauce\n\nEggplant is the star of this easy meal idea for seniors and is a great source of senior nutrition that boasts phytonutrients — a memory booster — and fiber for digestive health.[02] It’s also a soft food that’s easy on dentures without being mushy.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 eggplant, cut into ½-inch slices\n\n2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped (use pre-chopped from the jar if easier)\n\n¼ cup olive oil\n\n1 teaspoon Mediterranean spice blend or your favorite blend\n\nInstructions\n\nPlace eggplant slices on a baking sheet and sprinkle with salt. Let them sit for a couple minutes while your oven preheats to 400 F (this softens them and reduces bitterness).\n\nMix garlic, olive oil, and spice blend in a small bowl.\n\nBrush both sides of eggplant with the olive oil mixture for a dose of heart-healthy fats.\n\nRoast eggplant for about 30 minutes, until caramelized, flipping once about halfway through.\n\nFor the Creamy Yogurt Sauce\n\n1 cup Greek yogurt (a great source of probiotics for digestive health)\n\n1 clove garlic, finely chopped\n\n1 tablespoon lemon juice\n\n1 teaspoon honey\n\n1 tablespoon fresh herbs, like basil or mint (optional)\n\nMix all ingredients in a small bowl; add salt and pepper to taste. Serve your roasted eggplant with the yogurt sauce for a fresh, Mediterranean dish. Consider brown rice, whole-grain pasta, or chopped cucumbers and tomatoes as a side dish.\n\n7. “Anything goes” quiche\n\nQuiche has been a popular brunch food for decades and was seen as a luxury for many seniors growing up. This is a fairly inexpensive, easy meal idea for elderly adults that includes leafy greens rich in magnesium, iron, manganese, and vitamins A, C, and K.[02] Make this tasty treat for breakfast and enjoy leftovers throughout the week.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 refrigerated pie crust\n\n5 eggs\n\n1 cup half-and-half\n\n½ teaspoon seasoning of your choice, such as mustard, dill, or rosemary\n\n¾ cup crispy bacon, crumbled cooked sausage, or leftover ham, chopped\n\n1 cup shredded cheddar or Swiss cheese\n\n1 cup spinach or kale, torn or chopped\n\n½ cup of your favorite veggie, diced (tomato, broccoli, asparagus, and peppers are good options)\n\nInstructions\n\nPreheat oven to 350 F and roll pie crust into your pie plate.\n\nWhisk eggs, half-and-half, and seasoning in a medium bowl.\n\nSprinkle meat, cheese, and veggies onto the prepared pie crust evenly. Pour the egg mixture to cover.\n\nBake for 40-50 minutes or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Let cool 10 minutes before slicing and enjoying.\n\nRecipe adapted from Pillsbury, with vegetables added\n\nLet our care assessment guide you\n\nOur free tool provides options, advice, and next steps based on your unique situation.\n\nEasy pantry staple meal ideas for elderly adults\n\nAll of these easy-to-cook recipes for seniors are a nutritious rewrite of a traditional classic. Plus, they all use at least three pantry or freezer staples to minimize shopping and stay budget-friendly. While carbohydrates are often talked about in a negative light, they’re actually part of a healthy diet and help aging adults find energy to fuel their daily activities, according to WHO.[01]\n\n8. Healthy-ish tuna veggie casserole\n\nThis no-fuss take on the classic is perfect for a rainy afternoon when you’re in the mood for something hearty but nutritious. The pasta provides whole grains, while the tuna offers heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D, which are both great for senior nutrition.[02] Broccoli and peas are also rich sources of nutrients and antioxidants.\n\nNote: If arthritis makes opening cans difficult, invest in an electric can opener — it’s a great kitchen tool!\n\nIngredients\n\n1 (12-ounce) bag whole-wheat egg noodles\n\n2 (5-ounce) cans tuna, drained\n\n2 (10 ¾-ounce) cans cream of mushroom soup\n\n2 cups frozen veggies, like peas, broccoli, carrots, or a combination\n\n½ cup milk\n\n1 cup shredded cheddar cheese\n\n8 buttery crackers, like Ritz\n\nInstructions\n\nPreheat oven to 350 F and grease a 3-quart casserole dish or 13-by-9-inch pan.\n\nCook whole-wheat noodles according to package directions; drain thoroughly.\n\nMix the warm cooked noodles with tuna, soup, veggies, milk, and cheese. Season with salt and pepper as desired (you can add some red pepper flakes for a kick). Spoon into your prepared pan.\n\nCrush up your crackers into small chunks and spread over the top. Feel free to add some more shredded cheese!\n\nBake for 20 minutes until golden, bubbly, and beginning to brown. Serve warm.\n\nRecipe adapted from The Spruce Eats\n\n9. Southwest stuffed sweet potatoes\n\nSweet potatoes are a powerhouse of nutrients, vitamins, and minerals — and they keep as pantry staples for nearly a month.[02] They also may improve your immune system with high levels of vitamin A.\n\nIngredients\n\n2 large sweet potatoes, washed and dried\n\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n\n1 (12 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained*\n\n1 (10 ounce) can diced tomato pepper mix, drained\n\n1 cup shredded cheddar or pepper jack\n\n*For a soft food substitute, use refried black beans.\n\nInstructions\n\nPreheat oven to 425 F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or nonstick aluminum foil.\n\nCut potatoes in half lengthwise, then brush with olive oil and salt.\n\nBake potatoes (cut side down) for 30 minutes or until cooked through.\n\nRemove from oven, allow to cool slightly, and mash up potato flesh with a fork.\n\nSprinkle potatoes with beans, tomato pepper mix, and cheese so the toppings are evenly divided.\n\nReturn to the oven for 5 minutes until cheese is melted.\n\n10. Chickpea tuna salad\n\nHigh-protein chickpeas are a good source of magnesium and potassium, which may reduce blood pressure.[02]\n\nIngredients\n\n1 (15-ounce) can low-sodium chickpeas, rinsed and drained\n\n1 (5-ounce) can tuna, drained and flaked\n\n1 tablespoon Dijon mustard\n\n3 tablespoons olive oil mayonnaise (regular mayo works just fine but is higher in cholesterol)\n\n1 cup halved cherry tomatoes\n\n½ cup green or black olives, or 2 tablespoons capers (optional)\n\nSpinach or torn salad greens\n\nInstructions\n\nAdd the chickpeas, tuna, mustard, mayonnaise, and cherry tomatoes to a bowl and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper to your liking. Add olives or capers, if using.\n\nLay a bed of spinach or greens on a plate and top with salad mixture for an easy dinner. Alternatively, eat the salad between two slices of whole-grain bread like a tuna salad sandwich.\n\n11. Simple soup\n\nThis is a go-to healthy recipe for seniors because it’s open to substitutions and relies on nutrient-dense pantry staples. It’s also a soft food that works for seniors who have trouble chewing or other dental problems.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 pound ground beef, Italian sausage, or turkey\n\n1 small onion, diced\n\n1 (32-ounce) box low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth\n\n1 (15 ounce) can cannellini or white beans\n\n1 (10 ounce) can crushed or diced tomatoes\n\n1 cup frozen or canned spinach or collard greens (use fresh if you’ve got them on hand)\n\n1 teaspoon Italian seasoning\n\nInstructions\n\nAdd meat to a large soup pot over medium heat. Break apart and stir until browned. Add onion and continue to cook, about 5 minutes, until soft.\n\nIf a fair amount of fat has collected at the bottom of your pan, pour the meat mixture onto paper towels to drain. This may not be necessary for ground turkey or lean beef.\n\nReturn meat and onions to the pot and add remaining ingredients. Reduce heat to low and simmer for about 30 minutes until the flavors have melded. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\nServe alongside crusty whole-grain bread for a filling meal, or, for a heartier meal, add cooked pasta before serving.\n\nTip: If you’re cooking for someone who prefers softer food, a good trick for soups or stews is to blend half and add it back into the pot for a smoother texture. If blending part of the soup, use caution. The liquid will be hot, and, if not handled with care, blenders can splatter the liquid, creating a burn risk. Make sure to keep a hand on the blender lid while blending to reduce the risk of it coming off.\n\n12. Four bean salad\n\nThis easy recipe is a classic for a reason! The dressing is tangy and sweet, and beans provide proteins and B vitamins.[02] We switched out traditional vegetable oil in favor of olive oil for a more heart-healthy fat.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 (15-ounce) can wax beans\n\n1 (15-ounce) can green beans\n\n1 (15-ounce) can kidney beans, drained and rinsed\n\n1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed\n\n1 white or yellow onion, thinly sliced\n\n⅔ cup white or apple cider vinegar\n\n½ cup white sugar or ¼ cup honey\n\n⅓ cup olive oil\n\nInstructions\n\nMix all ingredients together in a large bowl or Tupperware container. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\nRefrigerate overnight, or at least for several hours, to marinate. Enjoy as a side for grilled chicken or as a topping for green salad.\n\n13. Italian stuffed peppers\n\nBell peppers are a low-calorie, high-flavor vegetable containing folate, fiber, and iron, making them a great source for senior nutrition.[02] They’re also a good base for a variety of fillings and sauces. This versatile, easy recipe could even be made as Mexican stuffed peppers with salsa and taco seasoning.\n\nIngredients\n\n4-6 bell peppers (red, green, yellow, and orange all work)\n\n1 pound ground Italian sausage or ground beef\n\n1 cup cooked quinoa, wild rice, or whole grain of your choice\n\n1 (15-ounce) jar or can tomato sauce\n\n1 cup frozen spinach\n\n1 tablespoon Italian seasoning\n\n½ cup shredded low-fat mozzarella\n\nInstructions\n\nPreheat oven to 350 F and grease an 8-inch glass baking dish or casserole.\n\nCut the tops from peppers, scoop out seeds, and rinse.\n\nIn a medium skillet, cook beef or sausage about 10 minutes, or until browned. Remove from heat and drain the meat, then return to pan.\n\nStir grains, 1 cup of the tomato sauce, spinach, and seasonings into the cooked meat.\n\nNestle peppers, standing up, into the baking dish. Stuff them with the meat, grain, and spinach mixture until full.\n\nPour remaining tomato sauce over the peppers and top with shredded mozzarella. Cover the baking dish tightly with aluminum foil.\n\nBake 20 minutes covered. After 20 minutes, remove the foil and bake about 10 minutes longer until cheese is melted and bubbly.\n\n14. Creamy pasta and peas\n\nBright green peas — a low-fat legume naturally high in protein and fiber — and fresh lemon are flavorful ingredients that give easy recipes a pop of color and flavor. This dish also offers plenty of onion (full of antioxidants) and olive oil, a heart-healthy, vegetable-based fat.[02]\n\nIngredients\n\n1 zucchini or summer squash, cut into thin rounds\n\n1 small onion, diced\n\n2 tablespoons olive oil, plus some for serving\n\n½ pound short pasta, like shells or penne\n\n1 pound bag frozen peas\n\n½ cup grated Parmesan cheese\n\nLemon juice to taste\n\nFresh basil, if desired\n\nInstructions\n\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil on the stove.\n\nWhile the water heats up, sauté zucchini or squash, onion, and olive oil over medium heat in a separate pan.\n\nCook pasta according to package directions, adding your frozen peas to the boiling water with 5 minutes remaining.\n\nRemove 1 cup of starchy pasta water from the pot and set aside. Drain pasta and peas and return to the pot, along with onion, olive oil, and veggies.\n\nWhile the mixture is hot, add Parmesan and stir. Slowly, begin to add the starchy water to the mixture. This is where the magic happens! The Parmesan and pasta water will emulsify to make a creamy, restaurant-style sauce — no heavy cream involved.\n\nSprinkle with lemon juice, salt and pepper, and a light drizzle of olive oil to serve. Add basil, if desired.\n\nFamily recipes for senior fun with grandchildren\n\nCooking is a fun way to bond with grandchildren while passing along important life skills.

However, if a senior is starting to need more help with activities of daily living, like walking and eating, then they may benefit from assisted living.\n\nBoth independent living and assisted living offer senior residents delicious and nutritious meal plans, often created with the help of registered nurses, nutritionists, and/or dieticians. Furthermore, most communities accommodate special diets and restrictions. For instance, around 62% of both independent and assisted living communities offer vegan and/or vegetarian meals within A Place for Mom’s network.[05]\n\nIf exceptional dining is particularly important, you can contact a Senior Living Advisor for more information.

      "# [Assisted Living vs. Memory Care: 5 Key Differences by Merritt Whitley on 2024-09-20](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/assisted-living-vs-memory-care)\nKey Takeaways\n\nAssisted living provides caregiver assistance that focuses on activities of daily living such as bathing and dressing.\n\nMemory care provides specialized assistance for seniors with dementia that focuses on safety in a specially designed environment.\n\nSome assisted living communities offer memory care on-site, making it easy for seniors to get the care they need without moving.\n\nMemory care costs more than assisted living due to the added care and supervision that residents need.\n\nThe differences between assisted living and memory care\n\nIt’s normal to wonder about your loved one’s care needs, whether they have a dementia diagnosis or you’re simply noticing a change in their cognitive abilities. About 70% of adults older than 65 will need long-term care, and many will have some type of cognitive decline or memory loss.[01]\n\nMaureen Bradley gained valuable experience working in assisted living communities and as a memory care director before joining A Place for Mom. She explains the overlap between assisted living and memory care.\n\n“The average age in assisted living these days is around 85, and that age group makes up nearly three-quarters of the people who have dementia. What this means is that it’s very common for people in assisted living communities to be in the early stages of dementia,” says Bradley.\n\nStill, you’ll want to evaluate both types of senior living communities carefully to make sure your parent’s needs will be met.\n\n1. Safety\n\nGeneral assisted living communities may offer safety features like in-room emergency alert systems and daily check-ins. For seniors with memory loss, increased safety is a major concern, as wandering, aggression, and falls are common and dangerous dementia behaviors.\n\nTo help keep residents safe, memory care-specific communities often have added security features such as:\n\nLocked entrances and exits\n\nKeypad entries\n\nObscured exits\n\nDoorbells that signal entering and exiting\n\nTo reduce anxiety and avoid injuries from falls, facility layouts include design elements that minimize confusion. Plus, memory care communities provide additional calming therapies within soothing spaces. This added level of care is aimed at reducing the agitation and confusion that may lead to aggression or self-injury in persons with dementia.\n\n2. Staff training and care\n\nStaff members at both assisted living and memory care facilities have experience supporting residents with day-to-day tasks. But staff at memory care facilities are specially trained in dementia care and provide supervision to residents around the clock. This helps seniors with dementia maintain cognitive skills, a sense of self, and quality of life for as long as possible.\n\n“Memory care communities tend to have a much higher caregiver-to-resident ratio. This is important because it can take longer to provide ADL care, and people in memory care often need more direct oversight for safety and social engagement,” says Bradley.\n\nCaregivers at memory care facilities are trained to effectively and compassionately prevent and manage difficult dementia behaviors, such as wandering and aggression. They understand the balance of encouraging residents to stay as independent as possible while providing the support they need.\n\nRead more:Person-Centered Care and Its Role In Assisted Living: A Guide\n\nLet our care assessment guide you\n\nOur free tool provides options, advice, and next steps based on your unique situation.\n\n3. Amenities\n\nAmenities vary greatly from one community to the next, but most assisted living communities offer the following:\n\nGyms\n\nBeauty salons and barber shops\n\nOutdoor spaces like gardens or courtyards\n\nPet-friendly accommodations\n\nTransportation services\n\nLibrary, TV, and game rooms\n\nArts and crafts studios\n\nSpas or relaxation rooms\n\nMemory care communities often feature many of these same amenities, but you’ll also find unique layouts and design features to help orient residents and reduce confusion. For instance, design elements in memory care communities may include the following:\n\nClearly defined common areas\n\nColor-coded walls to make it easier for residents with memory loss to find their way\n\nOutdoor gardens to prevent residents from feeling trapped or confined\n\nIncreased opportunities for personalization, like memory boxes outside of residents’ doors to guide and help them feel at home\n\n4. Activities and therapies\n\nAssisted living staff organize activities for active seniors who may need some help with everyday tasks. With this demographic in mind, assisted living offers plenty of social opportunities. A wide range of planned activities are scheduled to appeal to different interests. These activities may include:\n\nExercise classes\n\nBook clubs\n\nGames\n\nParties\n\nKaraoke\n\nOutings\n\nMemory care offers both group and individual memory care activities and therapies designed specifically for seniors with memory loss.\n\n“There’s focus on structure, sensory stimulation, getting direct sunlight whenever possible, and cultivating engagement. All of these things minimize or even eliminate sundowning, help with sleep patterns, and allow residents to enjoy their days,” Bradley says.\n\nMany memory care facilities provide activities tailored to residents’ interests and programs that encompass the physical, mental, and spiritual aspects of health.\n\nSome of the specialized therapies available at memory care communities may include the following:\n\nMusic therapy, which promotes relaxation and reduces agitation in seniors with Alzheimer’s or other types of dementia\n\nArt therapy, which may help slow cognitive decline\n\nReminiscence therapy, which uses senses like smell, taste, touch, and sight to help seniors remember people, events, and places\n\nPet therapy for companionship\n\n5. Costs\n\nMany factors affect the costs of assisted living and memory care, including the following:\n\nLocation\n\nRoom size\n\nWhether a space is shared with a roommate\n\nWhat services are provided\n\nBeyond this, costs are calculated a little differently for each care type.\n\nGeneralized assisted living communities typically charge a base monthly rate that covers the following:\n\nRoom and board with three meals a day and snacks\n\nMost activities (outings may cost extra)\n\nHousekeeping and laundry\n\nTransportation to and from medical appointments\n\nHelp with ADLs may be an additional charge, depending on how much assistance a resident needs.\n\nAcross A Place for Mom’s partner communities, the nationwide median price of assisted living community is $4,995 per month.[02] The cost of memory care tends to be higher, with a median monthly cost of $6,200 per month across our partner communities.[02]\n\nMemory care communities are more expensive because they offer specialized care and services that general assisted living communities typically don’t offer.\n\nAssisted living vs. memory care: What services are offered?\n\nThis chart summarizes the key differences in services offered at assisted living and memory care communities.\n\nServicesAssisted LivingMemory CareHelp with ADLsxxMeal servicexxMedication managementxxCare coordinationxxHousekeeping and laundry servicesxxExercise classesxxTransportation to appointmentsxxSpecialized care for dementia and memory lossx24-hour care and supervisionxxSecured entrances and exits to prevent wanderingxMemory-enhanced therapiesxHigh staff-to-resident ratioxUnique layouts to reduce confusionx\n\nRead related article:Find Assisted Living for Adults with Mental Illness: A How-To Guide\n\nHow to decide between assisted living and memory care\n\nBradley encourages families to be mindful of their loved one’s prognosis as they consider the main differences between assisted living and memory care.\n\n“It helps to understand the kind of dementia your loved one has and how quickly it is expected to progress,” says Bradley.\n\nSome seniors in the middle stages of dementia may begin to need a higher level of supervision. For others, this happens a little later. It’s best to include input from your loved one’s doctors or other caregivers when making a decision.\n\nChoosing assisted living\n\nAssisted living may be a good fit for your loved one if memory loss isn’t an immediate concern or if they’re in the early stages of dementia. Sometimes it may also be a good fit for seniors experiencing the middle stages of dementia, provided that they don’t wander.\n\n“Assisted living communities can be very helpful with things that matter during the early- and mid-stages of dementia, such as managing medications and helping with reminders for showering, meal times, and the like,” Bradley says.\n\nIf you’re unsure about how advanced your loved one’s dementia is, you may want to speak with their doctor to determine if they’re showing signs it might be time for memory care.\n\nChoosing memory care\n\nAs dementia progresses and symptoms worsen, many families do opt for memory care.\n\n“Oftentimes, safety is the driving factor for deciding it’s time to make the switch to memory care,” says Bradley. “If their loved one is prone to going for walks and getting lost, for example, assisted living is no longer an option. They may also start doing things like trying to drink their shampoo or get restless later in the day.”\n\nIn addition to a memory care facility’s built-in security features, the 24-hour oversight provided by staff in a memory care community can significantly add to a senior’s safety.\n\nMemory care in assisted living: A promising third option\n\nSome assisted living communities also offer advanced memory care units on-site, so that both care types are available within the same community. This can be a good long-term care option for seniors. For instance, a senior with early-stage dementia may be able to move to a general assisted living community first and then transition to the memory care level later, if needed.\n\n“This is the ideal situation,” says Bradley. “It’s much less traumatic for the person living with dementia to simply change rooms or locations in the same community. They know the staff, recognize the surroundings, and oftentimes there’s intermingling for activities and events. They can still see their friends.”\n\nOn the other hand, moving from one community to a completely new one may require more thoughtfulness from family members to help ensure that the move goes smoothly.\n\n“As dementia progresses, moving someone can be very hard on them and even trigger a big decline in condition,” says Bradley.\n\nTalk with a Senior Living Advisor\n\nOur advisors help 300,000 families each year find the right senior care for their loved ones.\n\nNext steps as you consider memory care\n\nWhen you’re weighing options, it’s important to remember that each community is unique and what’s available to you will vary depending on your loved one’s location and budget.\n\n“I would strongly encourage families to check out a number of care settings,” says Bradley. “In some places, memory care may have advanced-stage dementia residents and look like a skilled nursing setting. Other memory care communities have more active, vibrant populations. There’s a wide variety of culture and care approaches, including specialized neighborhoods and the Montessori model.”\n\nAccording to Bradley, this might be the most important part of the process.\n\n“Finding the right fit for your loved one can make all the difference when it comes to quality of life for Mom or Dad and satisfaction for the rest of the family.”\n\nIf you’re looking for options in your area, A Place for Mom’s Senior Living Advisors can help by considering your loved one’s lifestyle, budget, and abilities to make the right recommendations — all at no cost to your family.",
      "# [Sen. Casey calls out A Place for Mom over ‘potentially deceptive business practices’ by Kimberly Bonvissuto on 2024-06-20](https://www.mcknightsseniorliving.com/news/sen-casey-calls-out-a-place-for-mom-over-potentially-deceptive-business-practices/)\nAfter having its “trusted advisory service” tagline called into question last month by the Washington Post, senior living referral service A Place for Mom now is the target of US Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA), who is questioning the company’s “potentially deceptive business practices.”\n\nCasey, chairman of the US Senate Special Committee on Aging, in a letter dated Monday and shared Tuesday, asked the referral site to disclose more information about its business efforts, including its advertising practices. Stating that he is seeking clarity on how the company operates, Casey accused the company of “misleading older adults and their families by claiming that it is an unbiased and no-cost recommendation and referral service for people in search of assisted living facilities.”\n\nReferencing company marketing materials and information used in The Washington Post analysis, Casey said that the company’s recommendations are “not objective, not safe and not truly free.”\n\nHe suggested that the company only refers people to senior living communities that pay a commission, pointing to some A Place for Mom top-rated communities that “actually have records of substandard or dangerous care.” The senator wrote that A Place for Mom has a “record of placing referred residents in jeopardy” and “attempts to avoid responsibility” and liability by not vouching for the accuracy or completeness of information on communities listed on its site. By not disclosing the financial relationship the company has with companies listed on its site, Casey said, the company’s advertising is biased, false and misleading.\n\nHe also accused the company of encouraging families to “spend above their initial budgets,” pointing to its own data showing that 38% of families whose use of the service resulted in a move to assisted living paid monthly rent that was higher than the upper limit of their budget range, a figure that increased to 55% for memory care referrals.\n\n“It is clear A Place for Mom is upselling families, and the company ultimately benefits from families spending beyond their means,” Casey wrote.\n\nA Place for Mom previously told McKnight’s Senior Living that it is continually improving its processes based on feedback from residents and families, and that it is dedicated to “providing access to transparent information, tools and resources” to help families make informed decisions.\n\nCasey asked the company to provide information and documents by July 15 on three years of revenue, contract and partnership sample agreements with participating operators, fee data, training data for the company’s senior living advisers, and the company’s process for reviewing licensing, inspection, audit, complaint and other safety data on communities before they are listed on the website.\n\nHe further questioned the company’s ownership by private equity firms, an arrangement that Casey said “underscores its own profit seeking motives.”\n\nFounded in 2000, A Place for Mom was owned by Warburg Pincus from 2010 to 2017. The company was sold in 2017 to technology investment firm Silver Lake and global growth equity firm General Atlantic. Two years later, the company made news when it agreed to a $6 million settlement in a class action lawsuit claiming the company violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. At the time, the company said it did not agree with the allegations.\n\nThe question about private equity comes after two of Casey’s colleagues in the Senate, Sens. Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren, both of Massachusetts, recently introduced a bill they say is meant to “root out corporate greed and private equity abuse” in assisted living communities, nursing homes, home health agencies, hospices and other “healthcare entities.” Warren also sits on the Senate Aging Committee.\n\nIncreased scrutiny\n\nCasey’s letter to A Place for Mom follows letters he sent to senior living companies Brookdale Senior Living, Atria Senior Living and Sunrise Senior Living in January asking them to address “significant concerns” about costs, staffing levels and resident safety.\n\nAssisted living providers also came under scrutiny in November coverage by the New York Times and KFF Health News and in articles by the Washington Post in December and afterward. The lay media outlets reported on the deaths of residents with dementia who eloped from communities, the industry pricing structure, rate increases and the for-profit status of most providers. In a separate article in May, the Post published an analysis calling into question A Place for Mom’s description of itself as a “trusted advisory service,” accusing the senior living referral site of recommending communities that have been cited for neglect or providing substandard care and of using reviews that have been manipulated by providers.",

The referral model suggests that the company generates significant income from the facilities it partners with, but the exact scale of its operations remains unclear.\n\n## Market Position and Competition\n\nA Place for Mom is the leading player in the senior living referral market, but it faces increasing competition from both new boutique referral services and established senior living operators who are developing their own in-house marketing strategies [(Regan, Senior Housing News, 2024-11-18)](https://seniorhousingnews.com/2024/11/18/how-a-place-for-moms-new-ceo-is-evolving-the-companys-relationships-with-operators/). The scrutiny from lawmakers and media may also impact its reputation and operational model moving forward.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nA Place for Mom is a significant entity in the senior care referral space, but it is currently navigating a challenging landscape marked by regulatory scrutiny and public skepticism regarding its business practices. The company's recent leadership changes and innovations in service delivery may help it adapt to these challenges, but ongoing concerns about transparency and the quality of its referrals will need to be addressed to maintain trust with families and operators alike. \n\nFor prospective candidates and investors, understanding the evolving dynamics of A Place for Mom's operations and its response to regulatory pressures will be crucial in assessing its future viability and market position."
